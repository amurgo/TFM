                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a  decision  of
         First-tier Tribunal Judge Place, dated 3 March 2015, in  which  the
         judge allowed Mr  Harverye's  appeal  against  the  order  for  his
         deportation from the United Kingdom.




Background


      2. Mr Harverye is a national of Zimbabwe who was born on the 22  April
         1971.

      3. In a previous determination of this  Tribunal  (DA/00772/2011),  Mr
         Harverye's background was found by the  Upper  Tribunal  to  be  as
         follows:

               5. Mr Harverye is a citizen of Zimbabwe who was born  on  the
                  22nd April 1991. He is of mixed race as are his mother and
                  father. He arrived in  the  United  Kingdom  on  the  18th
                  November 1998 as the  dependant  of  his  mother  who  had
                  married a British  citizen.   He  was  granted  Indefinite
                  Leave  to  remain  on  29th  January  2001   although   an
                  application for naturalisation was refused on the 31st May
                  2007 as a result of his personal conduct.

               6. Mr Harverye has a criminal record which shows two offences
                  against the person  between  2008-2009,  three  theft  and
                  kindred  offences  between  2005  and  2008,  one  offence
                  relating to the  police/courts/prisons  in  2009  and  six
                  miscellaneous offences between 2008-2009. He received  his
                  first  reprimand/caution  in  2004  for  common   assault.
                  Details of those convictions are as follows:

                               detention in a Young Offenders Institution.

               7. It is as a result  of  the  last  offence,  for  which  he
                  received a five and a half year prison  sentence  that  Mr
                  Harverye was made  the  subject  of  a  deportation  order
                  pursuant to UK  Borders  Act  2007.   It  was  his  appeal
                  against the making  of  the  automatic  deportation  order
                  which was considered by the First-tier Tribunal.

               8.  The  sentencing  judge,  HHJ  Bennett,  sitting  at   the
                  Nottingham Crown Court noted that Mr Harverye was  not  of
                  good character and his guilty plea but in relation to  the
                  offence stated:

                  What you actually did, if you analyse it, in her own home,
                  is  you  attacked  [the  victim];  you  abused  her,   you
                  mutilated her, you intimidated her and you humiliated her.
                  All that over a long period of  time.  So  although  I  am
                  quite satisfied, as I have said to your counsel,  you  did
                  not go there with the intention of carrying out this  kind
                  of attack, the fact is when you saw the opportunity  after
                  opportunity after opportunity you took it.

                  Twice you poured boiling water over her. One has  only  to
                  look at the photographs to realise the extent of that  and
                  the consequence is she is scarred  for  life  and  had  to
                  undergo surgery.  She will never get  back  what  she  had
                  before you did  that  to  her,  so  far  as  her  body  is
                  concerned never mind the psychological damage. You used  a
                  melted plastic bottle and stuck it in her  neck.  That  is
                  absolutely awful. Then as if that was not bad enough,  you
                  humiliated her by trying to her  to  strip  and  dance  in
                  front of the group when she was injured in  this  terrible
                  way and warned her not to go to the police and  threatened
                  her.

                       That is a list, I am afraid, of extremely aggravating
                  factors.

                  The result is that if you had  been  convicted  for  doing
                  that at the hands of a jury I would undoubtedly have given
                  you 9 years in a Young Offenders Institute. As it is, with
                  mitigation, I shall give you 5 �. So  you  get  your  full
                  discount and six months off the balance of the  mitigating
                  features..... I can pass no less for something as horrific
                  as this.

               9. Mr Harverye has admitted he was a drug dealer.

              10. As a result of his conviction  Mr  Harverye  was  excluded
                  from the protection of the Refugee Convention and  it  was
                  found he had failed  to  rebut  the  presumption  that  he
                  constituted a danger to the community. The finding of  the
                  First-tier Tribunal in this regard was not  challenged  on
                  appeal.

      4. A number of findings were made in response to specific  submissions
         made by Miss Mair at the hearing in  2013  which  resulted  in  the
         following concluding paragraph:

             59.  Having considered all the evidence I do  not  accept  the
             argument that the  Mr  Harverye's  situation  will  result  in
             destitution as a result of his  personal  characteristics  and
             circumstances.  I do not find the evidence he  seeks  to  rely
             upon is sufficient to allow me  to  depart  from  any  of  the
             existing country guidance case law.   I  therefore  would  not
             find Mr Harverye has proved that the United Kingdom will be in
             breach of its obligations under Article 3 ECHR  should  he  be
             deported from the United Kingdom and returned to Zimbabwe with
             the exception of the real risk of such a breach as a result of
             the heightened levels of violence and associated risks at this
             election time, recognised in case law, and the unique  factors
             relating to Mr Harvey such as his lack of language skills.  If
             the elections  period  passes  and  violence  abates  and  the
             position is as per CM the Secretary of State will be  able  to
             reconsider her position. It is the timing  and  as  Miss  Mair
             submitted, the combination  of  Mr  Harvey's  characteristics,
             that create the real risk at this time.

      5. The appeal was allowed which created an outcry in certain  national
         newspapers at the time. The Daily Mail published  an  article  with
         the heading:

             Zimbabwean  criminal  who  burned  woman's  face  with  melted
             plastic cannot be deported because it would breach  his  human
             rights

             By Daily Mail Reporter

             Published:  11:18,  7  September  2013  |  Updated:  13:47,  7

             A judge has ruled a Zimbabwean national  who  was  jailed  for
             five and a half years after he scarred a woman for life cannot
             be deported because it would breach his human rights.

             Drug dealer Valentine Harverye burned his  34-year-old  victim
             with a melted cider bottle and scalded her with boiling water.
             He was said to have assaulted her in  front  of  five  or  six
             people at her home in 2009.

             An attempt to deport Harverye, made by the  Home  Office,  has
             now been defeated after he appealed against the move.

             Valentine Harverye has defeated an attempt by the Home  Office
             to deport him (file picture posed by model)

             Upper Tribunal Judge Christopher Hanson said deporting the 22-
             year-old could breach his human rights as he would not be able
             to demonstrate loyalty to Robert Mugabe's  party  and  so  may
             face 'ill-treatment', The Telegraph has reported.

             The paper reported the move would have breached Article  3  of
             the European Convention of Human Rights.

             A Home Office spokesman said:  'We  are  disappointed  by  the
             Tribunal's  decision  as  we  firmly  believe   that   foreign
             nationals who break the law should be deported.

             'We are examining the detail of this ruling before  we  decide
             whether to appeal.'

             Harverye was first convicted for common assault  in  2004.  He
             went on to commit a further 12 offences, including the assault
             which left a woman scarred in 2009.

             He was jailed for the offence at Nottingham Crown Court.

             Conservative MP  Priti  Patel  told  the  paper:  'This  is  a
             shocking case and a dreadful example of how  the  courts  have
             once again disregarded the  rights  of  the  victim  over  the
             rights of an appalling criminal.'

             Harverye was jailed at Nottingham Crown Court for the  assault
             on the 34-year-old woman.

             Earlier this week  it  was  revealed  the  number  of  foreign
             criminals who had avoided deportation because it would 'breach
             their human rights' had almost doubled in a year.

             Almost 300 offenders used Article 8 of the European Convention
             on Human Rights to argue their right to stay  in  the  country
             last year.

             Statistics from the  Home  Office  showed  that  299  'foreign
             national offenders won appeals' last year - up  from  177  the
             year before, the Sun reported.

             Article 8 protects the right to private and family life.

             'This is a shocking case and a dreadful  example  of  how  the
             courts have once again disregarded the rights  of  the  victim
             over the rights of an appalling criminal'

             - Conservative MP Priti Patel

             A week earlier MailOnline revealed  Sanel  Sahbaz,  a  foreign
             criminal  jailed  for  a  series  of  violent   attacks,   had
             successfully  argued  against  deportation  because  it  would
             violate his human rights.

             Sahbaz, a Bosnian who now lives in Hertford, came  to  Britain
             as a child in 1993. Since 2005 he has committed  a  string  of
             offences including  common  assault,  handling  stolen  goods,
             theft, public order offences and assaulting police.

             In one incident he attacked his landlord, pushing him  to  the
             floor, repeatedly kicking him and stamping on his  head  until
             the man fell unconscious.

             Sahbaz, 30, qualified for automatic deportation after  he  was
             jailed for four years, and the Home Office told him  he  would
             be sent home.

             But he has now been told he can  stay  indefinitely  after  he
             brought a legal challenge under Article 8.

             His lawyers argued that if he was sent back to Bosnia it would
             separate him from his parents, brother  and  cousin,  who  are
             also in Britain, which would breach his rights.

             In February Home Secretary Theresa May announced plans to pass
             a new law demanding that Article 8 of the Act should no longer
             be a bar to deportation.

      6. The appeal in 2013 was allowed under Article 3  ECHR,  an  absolute
         provision, and not Article 8 which has to be propionate.

The current proceedings


      7. Mr Harverye did not appeal against either  his  conviction  or  the
         sentence  imposed  by  the  Nottingham  Crown  Court  in  2009.   A
         deportation order was made against him pursuant to the  UK  Borders
         Act 2007 on 5 October 2011 as a result of that conviction.

      8. On completion of the requisite period of imprisonment  Mr  Harverye
         was detained under Immigration Powers on 11 October 2011. Following
         his appeal having  been  allowed  on  Article  3  ECHR  grounds  Mr
         Harverye was granted bail on 27 January 2012. On 27  July  2012  Mr
         Harverye was recalled to prison whilst  on  licence  to  serve  the
         remainder of his custodial sentence  following  his  breaching  the
         terms of that licence by contacting the victim of the offence.

      9. The Secretary of States documents show that following  Mr  Harverye
         being recalled to prison his case was reviewed by the Criminal Case
         Team at the Home Office and a decision made on the 1 July  2014  to
         resume deportation action against him. A new notice of liability to
         deportation action was issued against him on 1 July 2014 and notice
         of liability served on the 30 July  2014.  The  second  deportation
         order was signed on the  21  August  2014.   Mr  Harverye  appealed
         against  that  deportation  order  which  came  before   First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Place on the 27 February 2015 at Nottingham.

     10. The Judges findings are set out at paragraphs  15  to  20  of  that
         determination in the following terms:

             15.  I  agree  with  Ms  Mair's  first  submission,  that  the
                  Respondent's decision is not in accordance with  the  law.
                  Despite being  given  every  opportunity  to  do  so,  the
                  Respondent has not explained on what basis she has  issued
                  a  further  deportation  order  in  respect  of  the  same
                  offence. I find that the submissions set out in Ms  Mair's
                  skeleton argument are sound.   There mere fact that  Judge
                  Hanson said that it would  in  certain  circumstances,  be
                  open to the respondent to reconsider  her  position,  does
                  not constitute a legal  pathway  to  reopening  litigation
                  which was closed,  without  permission  to  appeal,  after
                  Judge Hanson's July 2013 decision.

             16.  In case I am wrong on this  point,  I  have  gone  on  to
                  consider  the  remaining  submissions.  The   Respondent's
                  position appears to be  that,  because  the  elections  in
                  Zimbabwe are over, the appellant is no longer at risk.

             17.  I agree with Ms Mair that the burden is on the Respondent
                  to show a change in circumstances in  Zimbabwe  sufficient
                  to justify departing from the Upper Tribunal's decision of
                  July 2013. The maxim "he who asserts must prove"  is  well
                  accepted.   I  take  as  my  factual  starting  point  the
                  findings made by Judge Hanson.

             18.  Mr Aigbokie is right in saying that Judge Hanson  made  a
                  number of findings which did not assist the Appellant.  He
                  found that the Appellant had no  significant  profile  and
                  took note of the cases of CM and  EM  which  held  that  a
                  person without such a profile would be unlikely to come to
                  the adverse attention of Zanu-PF, even in a  high  density
                  area of Harare, where the appellant  would  be  likely  to
                  have to settle.

             19.  Judge Hanson found (paragraph  58)  that  the  Appellants
                  would have to seek entry into the informal  economy  which
                  is controlled  by  the  Chipangano.   The  Respondent  has
                  adduced no evidence that the situation has changed. I find
                  the appellant would still face the  same  risks  of  being
                  identified  as  a  newcomer.   Judge  Hanson  found  that,
                  because of the imminent  elections,  the  appellant  would
                  face a risk if, as was probable, he could not  demonstrate
                  loyalty to Zanu-PF.

             20.  Although Judge Hanson's findings were closely  linked  to
                  the situation in Zimbabwe in the  pre-election  period,  I
                  find that it does not  follow  that,  simply  because  the
                  elections are over, the Appellant would not be at the same
                  risk.  He would be living in the same area, controlled  by
                  the same Chipangano. The responded  has  not  brought  any
                  evidence to my attention  to  show  that  Chipangano  have
                  changed their ways.  The CIG  report  shows  that  Zanu-PF
                  violence continues in Zimbabwe and that, if anything,  the
                  activities of Chipangano are increasing (see, for example,
                  section 2.3.11 to section 2.3.13)

             21.  Judge Hanson drew attention to the fact that  there  were
                  heightened levels of violence and associated risk  at  the
                  time of the elections. The Respondent has not shown, on  a
                  balance of probabilities,  that  those  heightened  levels
                  have since reduced.  I find that the  Respondent  has  not
                  shown that there are new  circumstances  which  now  alter
                  Judge Hanon's findings that the Appellant would be at risk
                  of a breach of his Article 3  rights  if  he  were  to  be
                  returned to Zimbabwe.  Judge Hanson's comment at paragraph
                  59 of his decision had 3 limbs: if the election passes and
                  (my emphasis) violence abates and the position is  as  per
                  CM.  The Respondent has only shown the first  limb  to  be
                  satisfied.   I  therefore  find  that   the   Respondent's
                  decision was incorrect and I allow the appeal.

     11. Permission to appeal was granted on a renewed application by  Upper
         Tribunal Judge Kekic. The operative  terms  of  the  grant  are  as
         follows:

             It is arguable that the judge  misdirected  herself  when  she
             concluded that the decision was not  in  accordance  with  the
             law.  She found that the respondent had no basis  to  issue  a
             deportation order in respect of the same offence but  arguably
             failed to have regard to the legislation under which the order
             was issued  (ground  1).   It  was  previously  found  by  the
             Tribunal that the appellant could not be returned to Bulawayo.
              In light of subsequent country guidance  the  judge  arguable
             erred in failing to revisit those findings.

Error of law finding


The deportation decision

     12. The specific terms of the deportation order issued in  August  2014
         are as follows:

                      VALENTINE MICHAEL JUNIOR HARVERYE

             Whereas  VALENTINE  MICHAEL  JUNIOR  HARVERYE  is  a   foreign
             criminal as defined by section 32(1) of  the  UK  Borders  Act
             2007:

             The removal of VALENTINE MICHAEL  JUNIOR  HARVERYE  is,  under
             section 32(4) of that Act, conducive to the  public  good  for
             the purposes of section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971.

             The Secretary of  State  must  make  a  deportation  order  in
             respect of a foreign criminal under section 32(5)  of  the  UK
             Borders Act 2007 (subject to section 33).

             Therefore in pursuance of Section 5(1) of the Immigration  Act
             1971, once any Right of Appeal, that  may  be  exercised  from
             within  the  United  Kingdom  under  section  82(1)   of   the
             Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 is exhausted, the
             said appeal is  dismissed,  or  if  VALENTINE  MICHAEL  JUNIOR
             HARVERYE does not have a right of appeal that may be exercised
             from within the United Kingdom, the  Secretary  of  State,  by
             this  order,  requires  the  said  VALENTINE  MICHAEL   JUNIOR
             HARVERYE to leave and prohibits him from entering  the  United
             kingdom so long as this order is in force.

     13. Section 32 of the 2007 Act defines a 'foreign criminal' as a person
         (a) who is not a British citizen, (b) has  been  convicted  in  the
         United Kingdom of an offence and (c)  to  whom  condition  1  or  2
         applies. Condition 1 is that the person is sentenced to a period of
         imprisonment of at least 12 months. Mr Harverye satisfies all three
         requirements and it is not disputed before me that he is a  foreign
         criminal.

     14. In her skeleton argument before the First-tier Tribunal,  which  Ms
         Mair continues to rely upon, it is submitted the above  deportation
         decision is not in accordance with  the  law  as  it  breached  the
         concept of common law fairness and arguably, to such an extent,  as
         to represent an abuse of process on the basis the  new  deportation
         decision, dated 18 August 2014, is made on the basis  of  the  same
         criminal offence which underpinned the  4  October  2011  decision,
         and, notwithstanding Mr Harverye  having  succeeded  on  appeal  in
         showing an exception under section 33 of the 2007  Act  applies  to
         him. It is submitted that the requirement of the Act is  for  there
         to be a conviction, not a recall on licence.

     15. There is no merit in  the  argument  that  the  application  of  an
         exception prevents the making of a deportation order. A feature  of
         the 2007 Act is section 33(7) which provides:

             (7)  The application of an exception-

                   a) does not prevent the making of a deportation order;

                   b) results in it being assumed neither that  deportation
                      of the person concerned is conducive  to  the  public
                      good nor that it is not conducive to the public good;

     16. This was commented upon by the Court of Appeal in  SS  (Nigeria)  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ  550  in
         which Laws LJ found at paragraph 51 of the lead judgment:

             54.  I  would  draw  particular  attention  to  the  provision
                  contained in s.33(7): "section 32(4) applies  despite  the
                  application of Exception 1...", that is to say, a  foreign
                  criminal's deportation remains  conducive  to  the  public
                  good notwithstanding his successful reliance on Article 8.
                  I  said  at  paragraph  46  that  while  the   authorities
                  demonstrate that there is no rule  of  exceptionality  for
                  Article 8, they also clearly show that the  more  pressing
                  the  public  interest  in  removal  or  deportation,   the
                  stronger must be the claim under Article 8  if  it  is  to
                  prevail. The pressing nature of the public  interest  here
                  is vividly informed  by  the  fact  that  by  Parliament's
                  express declaration the public interest is injured if  the
                  criminal's deportation is  not  effected.  Such  a  result
                  could in my judgment only be justified by  a  very  strong
                  claim indeed.

     17. Prior to the introduction for the UK Borders Act the power to  make
         a deportation order and, as a first step, to decide  to  make  one,
         stemmed from section 5(1) and section 3(5)(a) and section  3(6)  of
         the Immigration Act 1971.  Section 3(5) of the 1971 Act  gives  the
         Secretary of State power to deport a non-British Citizen (a) if  he
         deems it to be conducive to the public good (b) if  another  member
         of the family is to be deported and (c) if a  court  recommends  it
         after conviction of an offence punishable by imprisonment.

     18. Section 3(5)(a) is reflected in paragraph 363  of  the  Immigration
         Rules, which states that a person is liable  to  deportation  where
         the Secretary of  State  deems  that  person's  deportation  to  be
         conducive to the public good.

     19. The introduction of the automatic deportation  regime  changed  the
         way in which deportation appeals are considered. This is also a pre-
         10 November 2014 deportation decision and so  neither  the  current
         restrictions on rights of appeal,  nor  the  relevant  transitional
         provisions, apply.

     20. The Upper Tribunal in Greenwood (Automatic  Deportation:  Order  of
         Events) [2014] UKUT 00342 held that in an appeal against  automatic
         deportation there is no appeal against  a  decision  to  deport  or
         against the order to deport, but only against the decision  that  s
         32(5) applies.

     21. It is argued that if an exception applies the  Secretary  of  State
         cannot make a deportation order but section 32(7) states  otherwise
         and section 33(1)(a)  is  expressly  stated  as  being  subject  to
         subsection 7. The point is that even though the  deportation  order
         can be made a foreign criminal subject to such an order  cannot  be
         removed if an exception still applies.  The  exception  in  section
         33(2) specifically stating that:

             (2)  Exception 1 is where removal (my emphasis) of the foreign
                  criminal in  pursuance  of  the  deportation  order  would
                  breach -

                  (a)  a person's Convention rights, or

                  (b)  the United Kingdom's obligations  under  the  Refugee
                      Convention

                  ...

     22. Miss Mair raises the question of the legitimacy of the decision  by
         reference to the offence. The August 2014  decision  has  not  been
         made by reference to Mr Harverye's recall but by reference  to  the
         fact he is a foreign criminal. This ties the order into the offence
         of Grievous Bodily Harm for which Mr Harverye received the 5  years
         and 6 month period of imprisonment  in  2009.  It  is  therefore  a
         decision made  on  the  basis  of  the  last  offence  Mr  Harverye
         committed. Although it was found by this Tribunal in 2013  that  Mr
         Harverye's removal would breach the Secretary of States obligations
         under the ECHR this had no impact upon the application  of  section
         32(4) which  states  that  for  the  purposes  of  section  3(5)(a)
         Immigration Act 1971 the  deportation  of  a  foreign  criminal  is
         conductive to the public good.

     23. If it has been found, pursuant to an earlier appeal,  that  section
         32(5) is not applicable for at the relevant time one or more of the
         exceptions set out in section 33 apply, a change  in  circumstances
         must entitle the  Secretary  of  State  to  review  the  individual
         foreign criminals circumstances, and if there has been  a  material
         change, to seek to  deport  that  person  on  the  basis  that  his
         deportation remains conducive to the public good.  The  deportation
         order means that the Secretary of  State  must  remove  the  person
         against whom it is made from the United Kingdom.  It has  not  been
         made out that the Secretary of State is unable  to  proceed  unless
         the foreign criminal commits another 'qualifying' offence or unless
         an appeal out of time is made against the earlier finding  that  an
         exception(s) apply is successful. A later appeal  is  arguably  not
         viable as any appeal would have to assert legal error at  the  date
         the decision was made which is not proved by reliance on  a  change
         in circumstances.

     24. I find that the original  October  2011  deportation  order  was  a
         lawful order. The appeal against that order was to the effect  that
         that section 32(5) did not apply on the basis of the  circumstances
         that prevailed at that time. I find that the finding  an  exception
         to deportation applied on the facts did  not  have  the  effect  of
         extinguishing the deportation order which remained a valid order. I
         find the express wording of section 33(7) permits the Secretary  of
         State to make a further deportation order.  The Secretary of  State
         has not revoked the October 2011 deportation order and it therefore
         appears  there  are  two  valid  deportation   orders   in   force,
         notwithstanding the power to withdraw  an  existing  order  and  to
         remake the same pursuant to section 34(4) of the  2007  Act,  which
         provides:

             (4)  The Secretary of  State  may  withdraw  a  decision  that
             section 32(5) applies, or revoke a deportation order  made  in
             accordance with section 32(5), for the purpose of-

                  (a)  taking action under the  Immigration  Acts  or  rules
                      made under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1971  (c.
                      77) (immigration rules), and

                  (b)  subsequently taking a new decision that section 32(5)
                      applies and making a deportation order in  accordance
                      with section 32(5).

     25. Consideration has been  given  to  the  principle  of  finality  in
         litigation which forms the basis of  Ms  Mair's  challenge  to  the
         ability of the Secretary of State to procced as  she  has  in  this
         case. In paragraph 14 of her skeleton argument of the  26  February
         2015 Ms Mair puts it in the following terms "The Respondent  cannot
         simply make a second deportation decision  arising  from  the  same
         facts as the first deportation decision because she  has  lost  the
         case in the Tribunal".

     26. Finality in litigation is the concept that legal proceedings should
         not be open ended and should  conclude  with  a  decision  that  is
         intended to bring the proceeding to an  end  with  there  being  no
         'second bite of the cherry'.

     27. The purpose of the proceedings is to remove Mr  Harverye  from  the
         United Kingdom by way of a deportation order.  On  appeal,  on  the
         basis of the situation appertaining at that time, Mr  Harverye  was
         able to persuade the Tribunal that his removal  will  result  in  a
         breach of his human rights engaging section 33(2)(a)  of  the  2007
         Act.

     28. The situation faced by the Secretary of State in 2014 was  not  the
         same as that which prevailed when the original decision  was  made.
         It is accepted Mr Harverye has not been convicted  of  any  further
         offences but he has breached the terms of his Licence by contacting
         the victim of the  grievous  bodily  harm  which  resulted  in  his
         recall.

     29. Applying the principle of statutory construction, section  33(7)(a)
         of  the  2007  Act  is  unambiguous  in  that  notwithstanding  the
         existence of an exception the Secretary of State is entitled in law
         to make a deportation order. This represents a  fundamental  change
         to the pre 2007 deportation regime where no such provision  existed
         and the view of all practicing within the jurisdiction was that  if
         it was found removal pursuant to a section 5(1)(a) Immigration  Act
         1971 decision would breach a person Convention rights that was  the
         end of the matter. It  is,  however,  important  to  note  in  this
         respect that the appeal under the previous scheme was  against  the
         decision to make a deportation order which could not be made if the
         appeal was  successful  whereas  under  the  automatic  deportation
         scheme an appeal is based upon the consequences of removal once the
         order has been made.

     30. If a valid deportation order has been made pursuant to the 2007 Act
         but it found an exception applies,  section  33(7)  still  provides
         that section 32(4) applies i.e. that the deportation of  a  foreign
         criminal is conducive to the public good.  If the situation changes
         such that the exception relied  upon  in  the  original  appeal  no
         longer exists, it is arguable the structure of the statutory scheme
         permits the Secretary of State  to  issue  a  further  decision.  A
         finding that an exception exists is not a finding in perpetuity but
         based upon the situation appertaining at the date of the  decision.
         What is of vital importance is recognition of the  fact  the  fresh
         decision is a further immigration decision that  gives  rise  to  a
         further right of appeal, unless certified.

     31. I find the First-tier Judge erred in  law  in  finding  the  second
         deportation order to be an order 'not in accordance with the  law'.
         This is a material error.

Exception - section 33(2)(a)

     32. The First-tier Judge considered the appeal in  the  alternative  in
         case the preliminary finding in relation to  the  validity  of  the
         deportation order was wrong [16].  The  Judge  placed  considerable
         weight upon the findings of the Upper Tribunal in the determination
         in DA/00772/2011 which can be summarised as follows:

             i.   Mr Harverye is not a political activist and nor is  he  a
                  failed asylum seeker. He has no adverse political profile.
                  ...No election has yet been formally called but  there  is
                  evidence of an increase in the level of political violence
                  at the date of  this  hearing,  although  insufficient  to
                  allow me to depart from the country guidance cases [36].

             ii.  In light of Mr Harverye's profile I find he has failed to
                  substantiate his claim to be at  risk  on  return  at  the
                  airport. I find he has failed to  substantiate  his  claim
                  that he will be unable to pass through the airport without
                  difficulty. I find he will [37]

             iii. Mr Harverye has no proven savings of  his  own  and  will
                  need to establish himself in accommodation and employment.
                  Miss Mair accepted that funds could  be  transferred  from
                  abroad to assist him but  submitted  that  the  amount  he
                  receives will be less  due  to  charges.  I  accept  money
                  transfer agencies do impose charges on such transfers  but
                  those the Tribunal sees on a  regular  basis  are  on  the
                  whole modest and no evidence of the actual percentages was
                  provided.  I accept that one of Mr Harverye's sisters  has
                  stated she is unable to assist  him  at  this  time  as  a
                  result of her own  difficulties  and  loss  of  employment
                  opportunities. [38]

             iv.  The Assisted Voluntary Returns Programme is not available
                  to those who are the subject of a deportation  order.  The
                  lack of resources is  not  however  as  a  result  of  the
                  activities of the State but his own domestic situation. In
                  any event I do not find Mr Harverye has substantiated  his
                  claim that he will be returned to Zimbabwe destitute or in
                  a  situation  that  will   result   in   destitution   and
                  consequences sufficient to breach Article  3  on  economic
                  grounds. The case law sets  a  high  threshold  before  an
                  individual's  situation  can  be  said  to  be  more  than
                  hardship and before Article 3 is engaged. [39]

             v.   I do not find the claim there  is  no  financial  support
                  available to Mr Harverye to be substantiated. There may be
                  a reduced amount of financial support but I do not find it
                  plausible that the family would effectively abandon him if
                  he was returned to Zimbabwe. I  accept  that  any  support
                  that may be provided may not be a  substantial  amount  by
                  United Kingdom standards and that it may not be  available
                  long-term, but that is not the required test. [43]

             vi.  Even with limited  support,  such  as  that  Mr  Harverye
                  received in prison, payments  of  �30  a  fortnight  would
                  equate to approximately US$89 a month and �50 a  fortnight
                  US$150  approximately.   In  a  country  where   9,750,000
                  members of the population live on less than US$30 a  month
                  such an income, even  if  only  available  for  a  limited
                  period  of  time,  is  substantially  greater  than   that
                  available to the majority of the population. [45]

             vii. Some living below the poverty line in  Zimbabwe  will  no
                  doubt be reliant upon food aid and other support from  NGO
                  bodies. It has not been shown Mr Harverye will  be  denied
                  any such assistance,  if  required.  The  fact  he  is  an
                  individual without a family and an  initial  income  which
                  would buy very little in the United Kingdom does not  mean
                  he is unable to meet his basic needs in Zimbabwe.  Such  a
                  claim has not been substantiated on the evidence.[46]

             viii.    As Mr Harverye has been out of Zimbabwe for number of
                  years I accept he has no established roots  and  therefore
                  no home area to return to although both he and his  mother
                  were born in Bulawayo. This is some distance  from  Harare
                  and Mr Harverye has not substantiated his  claim  that  he
                  would have insufficient resources to  be  able  to  travel
                  from Harare to Bulawayo. It was  claimed  he  will  be  in
                  danger due to road blocks where he may be  challenged  and
                  because he is unable to demonstrate loyalty to the  ruling
                  party. One of the questions Dr Kibble was asked related to
                  the extent and nature of checkpoints and  restrictions  on
                  internal travel Mr Harverye would encounter. His response,
                  sourced from elsewhere but not challenged by Mr McGirr, is
                  to be found at paragraph 70 of his report, page 27, in the
                  following terms:

                      70.  Road blocks carried out by the police are partly
                           a process of economic extraction carried  out  on
                           the  public,  but  also  a  means  of  harassment
                           carried out on the public, but also  a  means  of
                           harassment     and  control,  where  busses   and
                           public vehicles are stopped and persons subjected
                           to   inspection   of   identity   documents   and
                           occasional  searched  of  goods.   John   Stewart
                           mentioned in a previous    communication  'in  my
                           last trip from Bulawayo  (28  September  2012)  I
                           passed through 13 road  blocks  on  the  trip  to
                           Harare (460km). At nearly every one of them  were
                           minibuses  or  buses  stopped   for   inspection.
                           Roadblocks appear and disappear on roads  out  of
                           Harare,  including  Bulawayo.   Such   roadblocks
                           normally  manned  by  militia,   sometimes   with
                           police/security force connivance (but   sometimes
                           by the latter) are both an income generating  and
                           political control  occurrence,  with  the  former
                           leading to the latter if no money is forthcoming,
                           or the person stopped is 'suspicious' e.g. in not
                           having a ZANU_PF card to those stopping her/him'.
                            He writes additionally 'controls and  harassment
                           are in the increase - on today'  date  (6  April)
                           there were thirteen road blocks on  the  road  to
                           Bulawayo,  according  to  the  informant.   While
                           these are often targeted  at  making  money  from
                           corruption, travelers on public transport - buses
                           and kombi-minibuses -  are  routinely  off-loaded
                           from the vehicle  and  identities  checked.   The
                           general insecurity  and  marginality  of  the  so
                           called coloured population will be  magnified  in
                           the case of an isolated and  fragile  young  man,
                           parachuted   into   an           unfamiliar   and
                           threatening environment.  Such a person is likely
                           to  be  a  favoured  target  of  harassment   and
                           mistreatment, especially since it will  be  clear
                           that there are no supporters or backup.  [47]

             ix.  The fact he may lose a sum of money through extortion  or
                  suffer harassment may not be sufficient to reach the  high
                  threshold of Article 3 although if he is  the  subject  of
                  beatings or serious ill-treatment  involving  violence  by
                  the State or from which the State offers no protection, he
                  may be. In this respect Dr Kibble [para 58,  Page  98  A's
                  bundle] states that in his opinion Mr Harverye would  find
                  extreme difficulty in being able to get to and survive  in
                  Bulawayo in matters of employment. Increased  violence  in
                  the city attributable  to  Zanu-PF  militias  add  to  the
                  possibilities of ill-treatment at the hands of the  formal
                  or informal state structures. [48]

             x.   If Mr Harverye remains in Harare it is  claimed  that  he
                  will be destitute as he will  have  no  accommodation.  Mr
                  McGirr   submitted   there   was   insufficient   evidence
                  accommodation could not be obtained, with  the  assistance
                  of charitable organisations if  needed,  and  the  country
                  information refers to such groups  and  church  groups  in
                  Zimbabwe. There is a particularly strong  church  movement
                  in Bulawayo.  I find Mr  Harverye  has  failed  to  adduce
                  sufficient evidence to allow me to find that he  will  not
                  be able to obtain assistance from such groups in  Zimbabwe
                  from whom he will be able to obtain  advice/assistance  in
                  relation to meeting his accommodation needs, or with other
                  issues.[49]

             xi.  Mr Harverye is a fit young man who  has  demonstrated  an
                  ability to act to defend his own  interests  even  through
                  acts of extreme  violence  towards  others.   He  has  not
                  substantiated a claim that he lacks the  necessary  skills
                  to survive but it is the consequences of  his  interaction
                  with others in Zimbabwe, which would have to occur even if
                  attempting to obtain accommodation, setting up a business,
                  or undertaking trading activities, which presents a  major
                  problem for him, especially if he speaks  neither  Ndebele
                  or Shona, both on a practical  and  'political'  level.  I
                  accept that in the absence of family  ties  Mr  Harverye's
                  return as a young man who for all intent and purposes  has
                  never lived in Zimbabwe will  make  resettling  there  and
                  adapting to life in that country a daunting and  different
                  prospect, but that is not the legal test. [51]

             xii.  Mr  Harverye  also  claims  that  he  will  face  social
                  discrimination as a result of  being  of  mixed  race.  He
                  refers to Dr Kibble's report in support of this  statement
                  but I find he has not substantiated his claim, even if  he
                  faces such discrimination, that it  will  amount  to  ill-
                  treatment or a course of conduct sufficient to breach  the
                  high threshold required to engage Article 3.[52]

             xiii.    Mr Harverye also claims he  will  find  it  difficult
                  obtaining an ID card and that if he does it may  contained
                  as part of its  reference  the  number  '00'  which  would
                  identify him as an alien.  In relation to this  issue  and
                  the submission that he will be stateless  I  find  neither
                  claim substantiated as Mr Harverye has failed to make  any
                  attempt to establish whether the Zimbabwe government  will
                  recognise his nationality, issue him with an ID  card,  or
                  endorse on that card the  lettering  referred  to  in  the
                  expert  report.  I  find  the  claim  that  he  may   have
                  difficulty obtaining relevant documents or that such  will
                  contain  the  relevant  endorsement  is   speculative.   I
                  therefore do not  find  Mr  Harverye  has  discharged  the
                  burden of proof upon  him  to  the  required  standard  to
                  substantiate his claim that he is stateless, that he  will
                  not be able to obtain an ID card which he may  require  to
                  access services, or that it will contain  any  endorsement
                  that may identify him as an alien. He has also  failed  to
                  substantiate his claim that any discrimination he may face
                  even if identified  as  an  alien  on  his  card  will  be
                  sufficient to breach the Article 3 threshold.[53]

             xiv. I accept Mr Harverye has no political profile  as  he  is
                  neither an MDC nor ZANU-PF supporter. The country guidance
                  case makes it clear that there are certain  areas  of  the
                  country where he is unlikely to  be  challenged  regarding
                  his political allegiances.  He does not state  in  any  of
                  his witness statements that he is unlikely to support  the
                  ruling party and if so the risk of ill-treatment  will  be
                  alleviated. At the date of the  hearing,  however,  he  is
                  politically neutral.[54]

             xv.  It is likely that his limited resources will require  him
                  to seek lodgings in a high density area where  housing  is
                  cheaper but such areas in Harare were considered in CM the
                  findings in EM were it was found that  whilst  the  socio-
                  economic  situation  in   high-density   areas   is   more
                  challenging,  in  general   a   person   without   ZANU-PF
                  connections  will  not  face  significant  problems  there
                  (including a "loyalty test"),  unless  he  or  she  has  a
                  significant MDC profile, which might cause him or  her  to
                  feature on a list of those  targeted  for  harassment,  or
                  would otherwise engage in political activities  likely  to
                  attract the adverse attention  of  ZANU-PF,  or  would  be
                  reasonably likely to engage in such activities, but for  a
                  fear of thereby coming to the adverse attention  of  ZANU-
                  PF. Mr Harverye has no such significant  profile  but  his
                  case must be considered at the date of  hearing  when  the
                  elections are said to be imminent  in  Zimbabwe.  In  this
                  regards Dr Kibble refers to the constitutional changes and
                  since the hearing the Constitutional Court in Zimbabwe has
                  rejected a joint application by the  President  and  Prime
                  Minister in Zimbabwe to delay  the  elections.  They  must
                  therefore occur before the  end  of  July  2013.  Although
                  there has been little evidence of reports of the  type  of
                  violence  seen  in  previous  elections  and  articles  in
                  newspapers in the UK alleging an  understanding  has  been
                  reached in the hope of minimising  elections  violence  to
                  make  the  polling  as  free  and  fair  as  international
                  observers would like it to  be,  with  the  indication  EU
                  sanctions may be relaxed if this occurs, Dr Kibble  refers
                  to an increase in internal politically  related  violence.
                  In his report [para 56, page  98  of  A's  bundle]  it  is
                  stated  that  the  CIO  remain  in  place  and  that   the
                  institutions  of  political  repression  have   not   been
                  transformed or dismantled. It is  specifically  stated  at
                  para 56 (a):

                           As the country looks to an election,  the  level
                      of political polarisation, antagonisms, controls  and
                      targeting is rising, in particular in areas which are
                      politically   contested,   such   as    Matabeleland.
                      Activities of police and other security services,  as
                      well as informal groups known  as  militias  and  war
                      veterans are already seen  to  be  on  the  increase.
                      [55]

             xvi. If Mr Harverye was to be challenged in other than English
                  he is unlikely to understand what he is being asked and if
                  this is a challenge to demonstrate loyalty, which he  will
                  not be able to do, he is at  risk  of  beatings  and  ill-
                  treatment. The fact he has no ZANU-PF party  card  and  is
                  unlikely to know the slogans and constantly repeated radio
                  jingles means it will be difficult if not  impossible  for
                  him to prove loyalty. Dr Jeater refers to  the  unemployed
                  joining the ZANU-PF  militia  but  she  also  states  that
                  orders are given in  the  vernacular  languages  and  such
                  groups have a reputation for beating and  torturing  their
                  own members as well as other citizens [para 3.3,  page  57
                  A's bundle]. [56]

             xvii.    The Tribunal in CM also  refers  to  the  Chipangano.
                  This group has been described as 'a brutal band  of  thugs
                  formed by Zanu (PF) in the 1980s and now running a  brazen
                  murder, violence and extortion racket that  started  as  a
                  hit squad for the party but which has become  a  lucrative
                  business'. An article broadcast on SW Africa Radio on 13th
                  April 2012 reported that the violent ZANU  PF  youth  gang
                  that has terrorised residents of Mbare  suburb  in  Harare
                  has reportedly started campaigning for the party,  forcing
                  innocent civilians to reveal their  personal  details  and
                  ordering them to  vote  for  Robert  Mugabe  in  the  next
                  election. The Chipangano gang, who operate  with  impunity
                  and with the support of top ZANU PF officials,  have  been
                  regularly forcing local residents, vendors and  passers-by
                  to attend ZANU PF rallies held  on  open  grounds  in  the
                  area. [57]

             xviii.   As it appears likely Mr Harverye will have to  remain
                  in Harare he will have to seek  accommodation  in  a  high
                  density area such  as  Mbare  as  he  will  not  have  the
                  economic resources to live elsewhere. He will have to seek
                  entry into the informal economy  which  is  controlled  by
                  Chipangano. He is therefore likely to be identified  as  a
                  newcomer and  challenged  in  relation  to  his  political
                  leanings by members of this group.  If  he  is  unable  to
                  demonstrate loyalty there is a real risk of  ill-treatment
                  sufficient to breach the high threshold of  Article  3  in
                  light of the imminent elections. [58]

     33. The conclusion of the previous Tribunal is set out at  paragraph  4
         of this decision, above. It is a conclusion specify to  the  events
         in Zimbabwe during the election period.

     34. In the event,  there  was  comparatively  little  violence  in  the
         elections in 2013 in Zimbabwe when compared to previous  elections.
         The ruling party won 61% of the vote. Allegations of  vote  rigging
         were made but the result stood and Mr Mugabe and his Zanu-PF  party
         retained power. The country evidence showed that the  elections  in
         fact passed relatively peacefully.

     35. The grounds of appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  raised  three
         issues, (i) the assertion the Secretary of State has  exceeded  her
         authority in pursuing deportation proceedings on a second  occasion
         arising from the same offence, (ii) an assertion the  Secretary  of
         State had provided insufficient country information  to  show  that
         the earlier findings of the Upper Tribunal should not  be  followed
         and (iii) that return to Zimbabwe will breach Mr Harverye's Article
         8 rights.

     36. Where it is asserted deportation will breach the  United  Kingdom's
         obligations under Article 8 ECHR paragraph A398 of the  Immigration
         Rules applies for all such claims from 28 July 2014. The Rules  are
         a complete code in relation to a deportation decision.

     37. Paragraph 398 of the Rules applies in that (a) Mr Harverye has been
         convicted of an offence for which he has been imprisoned  for  more
         than 4 years and his deportation is conductive to the  public  good
         [398 (a)].

     38. As paragraphs 398 (b) or (c) do not apply Mr Harverye is unable  to
         plead paragraph 399 or 399A. Accordingly, as provided by  paragraph
         398, the public interest in deportation will only be outweighed  by
         other factors where there are very  compelling  circumstances  over
         and above those described in 399 and 399A.

     39. It was also necessary in the context of Article 8  for  the  First-
         tier Judge to consider section 117 of the 2002 Act as  117C  is  of
         specific application to a deportation decision, the  provisions  of
         which are mirrored in the relevant immigration rules.

     40. There is no evidence of a  family  or  private  life  that  engages
         Article 8, the nature of the  interference  with  which  makes  the
         decision disproportionate on the  facts.   Section  119C(2)  states
         that the more serious the offence committed by a  foreign  criminal
         the greater the public  interest  in  deportation  of  the  foreign
         criminal.

     41. It has not been shown Mr Harverye has a partner  or  child  in  the
         United Kingdom. The key issue  in  relation  to  all  human  rights
         considerations being whether the  previous  findings  that  removal
         will breach Article 3 ECHR is still applicable for, if it is,  this
         will prevent his removal.

     42. The time at which the  First-tier  Tribunal  were  considering  the
         claim was not at  a  time  of  elections.  The  elections  in  2013
         returned Mr Mugabe for a further period of five years and his party
         shall therefore remain in power until 2018. What will  happen  then
         is not known in light of his advancing years and health issues.

     43. It is argued by Ms Mair that the influence  of  the  Chipangano  is
         increasing and that they are becoming more  violent  although  news
         reports from Zimbabwe from 2015 speak of the internal purges within
         Zanu-PF substantially weakening the group and the weakening of  its
         influence in the area of Harare where it operates.

     44. It is accepted that since the elections  Zimbabwe  experienced  the
         usual pattern of post-election retribution against those  who  were
         perceived to have failed to support Zanu-PF  or  not  to  have  co-
         operated during the election process, but this is not an issue that
         has been shown to impact upon Mr Harverye.

     45. The statistical data in the information provided by  the  Secretary
         of State to the First-tier Tribunal shows a reduction in  incidence
         of human rights abuses since 2008 as follows:




    |Year                        |Incidents                    |
|2008                        |23,755                       |
|2009                        |14,703                       |
|2010                        |10,703                       |
|2011                        |10,188                       |
|2012                        |5,096                        |
|2013                        |5,024                        |
|2014 (Jan-July)             |1,534                        |


     46. The map of violence per district to be found at paragraph 2.3.22 of
         the  Country  Information   and   Guidance,   Zimbabwe:   Political
         Opposition to ZANU-PF, October 2014  disclosed  to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal shows areas of Zimbabwe where no incidents of violence had
         been recorded, such as those in and around Bulawayo.

     47. It was accepted in  the  earlier  determination  that  Mr  Harverye
         originates from Bulawayo although he has  not  lived  there  for  a
         considerable number of years. It was accepted,  and  is  still  the
         case, that returnees to Bulawayo will in  general  not  suffer  the
         adverse attention of  the  Zanu-PF,  including  from  the  security
         forces even if they have a significant MDC profile. Mr Harverye has
         no adverse political profile.

     48. The key finding in the original decision was that as  a  result  of
         the timing of the appeal, and the heightened tensions at  the  time
         of an election, Mr Harverye could not  be  expected  to  travel  to
         Bulawayo for if he was challenged and could not show loyalty he was
         likely to be ill-treated. As a result he would be forced to  remain
         in Harare where the risks identified in the decision would manifest
         themselves.

     49. The  current  evidence  made  available  does  not  show  that  the
         situation in Zimbabwe is the same as that which prevailed when  the
         original decision was written. As such there was an obligation upon
         the Judge to do more than follow the previous findings. I find that
         in failing to analyse the evidence made available with the required
         degree of anxious scrutiny the Judge has materially erred in law.

     50. The only issue that led to the previous Tribunal finding there  was
         a real risk to Mr Harverye on return is set out above.

     51. Roadblocks are a way of life in Zimbabwe  and  numerous  complaints
         have been made by those in the tourist industry in 2015 -  2016  of
         corrupt police officers setting up frequent barriers  and  stopping
         traveller solely to secure a bribe. As stated this was not found to
         be sufficient to breach Article 3 previously. It has not been  made
         out that Mr Harverye will be unable to leave the airport on  return
         or that he will be destitute. It has not been shown that the  level
         of political violence or intimidation remains as it was  previously
         at this time or that he will be required to demonstrate loyalty  to
         Zanu-PF on arrival. It has not  been  made  out  that  he  will  be
         without funds on return which should enable him to meet  the  costs
         of travel to Bulawayo from Harare. It has not been  made  out  that
         only speaking English will prevent Mr Harverye from being  able  to
         negotiate his way around, as English is spoken throughout Zimbabwe.
         It has not been made out that he will not  be  able  to  travel  to
         Bulawayo without suffering a breach of his  Article  3  rights  and
         once  there  his  situation  is  as  considered  in   the   earlier
         determination and country information.

     52. Accordingly the evidence available to the First-tier Judge did  not
         establish a real risk of serious harm sufficient to show Article  3
         would be engaged. The evidence before the First-tier  tribunal  did
         not establish very compelling circumstances over  and  above  those
         described in paragraph 399 and 399A of the Immigration Rules.

     53. As no further material has been provided  and  having  found  legal
         error material to the decision to allow the appeal,  which  is  set
         aside, I go on to remake the decision.

     54. In light of the above findings Mr  Harverye's  appeal  against  the
         order for his deportation from the United Kingdom made as a  result
         of his conviction  for  grievous  bodily  harm  is  dismissed.  The
         election period has passed, violence has abated and the position is
         as per CM (Zimbabwe) [2013] UKUT 59.

Decision

     55. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
         the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
         follows. This appeal is dismissed.




  Anonymity.

     56. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
         45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
         2005. I make no such order pursuant to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
         Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
