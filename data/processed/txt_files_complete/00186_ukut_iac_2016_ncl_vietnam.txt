The de minimis principle is not engaged in the construction  or  application
of the Immigration Rules.  Properly analysed, it is  a  mere  surrogate  for
the discredited "near miss" or "sliding scale" principle.

                                  DECISION

Introduction

 1. The origins of this appeal can be traced to a decision made  on  behalf
    of the Secretary of State for the Home Department  (the  "Secretary  of
    State"), dated  09  November  2014,  whereby  the  application  of  the
    Appellant, a national of Vietnam aged 22 years, for  further  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student was refused.
     The application  failed  on  the  basis  of  non-compliance  with  the
    "maintenance" requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.   In  accordance
    with  these  requirements,  it  was  incumbent  on  the  Appellant   to
    demonstrate that her bank account  had  a  minimum  credit  balance  of
    �2,040 during the relevant period of 28 consecutive days.  Accompanying
    her  application  were  bank  statements  demonstrating  a  balance  of
    �2,028.32 only.  The application was refused accordingly.

 2. The Appellant's ensuing appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  (the  "FtT")
    succeeded.  It was allowed by the application of the  principle  of  de
    minimis non  curat  lex  (the  "de  minimis  principle").    The  Judge
    analysed the evidence in the following way:

    (a)  During the first 20 days of the 28 day period the shortfall in the
         Appellant's bank account was �11.68.

     (b) On the 21st day this reduced to �1.69.

    (c)  From the 22nd to 28th days inclusive the balance was  �3.31  above
         the minimum required.

    The Judge reasoned that the non-compliance  was  so  minimal  that  the
    Rules should have been "considered to have been complied with".

 3. The Secretary of State has been granted permission to  appeal  to  this
    Tribunal on the ground that in thus reasoning and  concluding  the  FtT
    arguably erred in law.

The De Minimis Principle

 4. It is necessary to study the route by which the FtT made its  decision.
    First, he referred to R (Behary) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2013] EWHC 3575 (Admin).  This is an admirably  constructed
    and reasoned first instance decision, of the Administrative  Court,  in
    which the claimant challenged the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  to
    refuse her application  for  further  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student on the ground that it was out of  time,  having  been
    received two days after the expiry of her extant leave.   Deputy  Judge
    Grubb accepted that, in principle, the de minimis principle "....   can
    be applied in the application of  both  statutory  provisions  and  the
    Immigration Rules": see [94].  However, the Judge rejected the argument
    that it was of application in the particular context, on  two  grounds.
    First, the non-compliance with  the  rule  in  question  could  not  be
    classified trivial: see [97].   Second, the context  within  which  the
    non-compliance occurred was one crying out for a "bright line" rule  in
    accordance with the principle of legal certainty: see [98] - [104].

 5. The argument advanced in Behary drew on two sources, each a decision of
    the Court of Appeal.  The first is MD (Jamaica) and GE (Jamaica) v SSHD
    [2010] EWCA Civ 213, where the question was whether the requirement  in
    the Rules of  ten  years  continuous  residence,  for  the  purpose  of
    securing indefinite leave to remain,  was  satisfied  in  circumstances
    where the first appellant had resided  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
    period of some 12 years but, in the course thereof,  had  acquired  the
    status of over stayer for two periods, of some  three  weeks  and  four
    months duration respectively.  In the case of the second appellant, the
    residence period exceeded ten years but was punctuated by  a  phase  of
    some ten weeks duration when he  had  the  status  of  over  stayer  on
    account of having made a late application, which ultimately  succeeded.
    Dyson LJ, delivering the judgment  of  the  Court,  having  rejected  a
    series of arguments advanced on behalf of  the  appellants,  stated  in
    [27]:

         "Finally, I see nothing absurd in giving the  rule  its  plain  and
         ordinary meaning.  The  case  of  the  applicant  who  submits  his
         application one day late is catered for by an  application  of  the
         principle de minimis non curat lex (the law is not  concerned  with
         very small things)."

     The appeals were dismissed.

 6. The final landmark in the journey of the FtT was  a  further  Court  of
    Appeal decision is Miah and Others v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 261, where  a
    similar question fell to be determined.   The  issue  was  whether  the
    appellant qualified for indefinite leave to remain  as  a  work  permit
    holder notwithstanding  that  during  part  of  the  qualifying  period
    stipulated by the Rules, five years, he  had  no  extant  work  permit.
    When he made his application to the Secretary of State he was  able  to
    demonstrate continuous residence of  four  years  and  ten  months.   A
    perusal of the judgment confirms that the argument  formulated  on  his
    behalf was that this "near miss" should be forgiven. It was recorded in
    this way, at [10]:

         "....  In oral argument the submission was .....  that  the  weight
         to be given to non-compliance with the Rules diminishes  where  the
         applicant is 'nearly' or 'almost' compliant."

         Under the rubric "Discussion", Stanley Burnton LJ stated, at [12]:

         "I first of all point out that the 'Near-Miss' principle  contended
         for is not the same as the de minimis  principle.  If  a  departure
         from a rule is truly de minimis, the rule  is  considered  to  have
         been complied with.  The starting point for the Near-Miss  argument
         is that the rule has not been complied with.  In the present  case,
         the failure  to  satisfy  the  requirement  of  five  years  lawful
         residence as a work permit holder, by a period of some two  months,
         was not de minimis."

    The reasoning underpinning this conclusion is set forth in [13] -  [26]
    of the judgment.  The Court held that bright line rules  are  necessary
    in the interests of certainty, predictability,  efficacy  and  utility.
    Disagreeing with the decision of a different constitution of the  court
    in Pankina and Others v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2010] EWCA Civ 719, the  court  in  Miah  decided  unambiguously,  per
    Stanley Burnton LJ, at [26]:


         "...  I would dismiss the  appeal  in  relation  to  the  Near-Miss
         argument.  In  my  judgment,  there  is  no   Near-Miss   principle
         applicable to the Immigration Rules."

 7. The operation of the de minimis principle in  certain  fields  is  well
    established.  For  example,  it  is  sometimes  invoked  (correctly  or
    otherwise) in the field of tort in  support  of  the  proposition  that
    trivial physical contact giving rise to no recognisable injury does not
    attract a right to compensatory damages.  In the  altogether  different
    field of copyright, infringement claims  have  been  dismissed  on  the
    ground that the alleged infringer's user of the protected work  was  so
    insignificant as to be de minimis.

 8. The de minimis principle can also denote a minimum quantity  threshold,
    for example in the context of state aid: see Commission Regulation (EC)
    Number 1998/2006, which prescribes a threshold of  E200,000.   Equally,
    in the sphere of competition law, certain agreements  in  contravention
    of Article 101(1) of the Treaty on  the  functioning  of  the  European
    Union are considered to be de minimis and, therefore, valid.  Thus  so-
    called "horizontal" agreements, viz contracts made between competitors,
    are normally classified de minimis where the party's  market  share  is
    10% or less.   The principle also  features  in  the  law  of  criminal
    causation, for example in the case of second  degree  murder:  see  the
    well known Canadian decision in R v JSR (A Young Person) 2008 ONCA 544.

 9. The de minimis aphorism is nothing if not  versatile  and  resourceful.
    According to Blackstone's Commentaries, the doctrine of  the  right  of
    riparian proprietors to alluvion gained by subtle degrees originates in
    this principle.  Its influence is also discernible in the  doctrine  of
    riparian accretions and  the  rule  that  the  law  does  not  consider
    fractions of a  day.   It  also  exercises  influence  in  the  law  of
    defamation, where certain imputations against a person's  character  or
    reputation have been held too trivial to be actionable.

10. The de minimis principle may  also  exercise  some  influence,  perhaps
    imperceptible on occasions, in the construction of  legislation.  Thus,
    for example, it may  contribute  to  the  resolution  of  the  familiar
    question of whether a statutory  provision,  typically  framed  in  the
    terms of a requirement, is mandatory or merely  directory.   The  court
    will consider, fundamentally, the importance of the matter in the light
    of the subject matter and general purpose of the statute and,  as  part
    of this exercise, the question of whether full and  literal  compliance
    with  the  provision  is  essential  to  implementing  the  legislative
    intention.  One of the  leading  authorities  on  this  topic  is  R  v
    Immigration Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Jeyeanthan [2000] 1 WLR 354.

11. Pausing at this juncture, it is not  easy  to  comprehend  how  the  de
    minimis principle can have any application in the context of construing
    and applying bright line rules in the  field  of  immigration,  whether
    enshrined in primary legislation  or  subordinate  legislation  or  the
    Immigration Rules themselves.  Whither the  values  of  predictability,
    certainty and finality if this adage, or  principle,  is  permitted  to
    intrude and influence?

12. The so-called "near miss" or "sliding scale" principle invites  further
    consideration.  It gained some currency during a finite  period  mainly
    as a result of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Pankina, at [45]-
    [46].  The principle had a relatively short lived lifespan.  Ultimately
    it received its quietus in Patel v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2013] UKSC 72,  wherein  Lord  Carnwath  JSC  delivered  an
    opinion with which the other members of the Supreme Court agreed.  This
    decision entailed an unequivocal rejection of Pankina.  See [56]:

      "Although  the  context  of  the  rules  may  be   relevant   to   the
           consideration of proportionality, I agree with Burnton  LJ  that
           this cannot be equated with a formalised "near-miss" or "sliding
           scale" principle, as argued for by Mr Malik.  That  approach  is
           unsupported by Strasbourg authority, or by a proper  reading  of
           Lord Bingham's words. Mrs Huang's case for favourable  treatment
           outside the Rules did not turn on how  close  she  had  come  to
           compliance with Rule 317, but on the application of  the  family
           values which underlie that Rule and are at  the  heart  also  of
           Article 8.  Conversely,  a  near-miss  under  the  Rules  cannot
           provide substance to a human  rights  case  which  is  otherwise
           lacking in merit".

     The retreat from Pankina was thereby completed.

13. Lord Carnwath's consideration of  this  discrete  question  of  law  is
    extensive, beginning at [45] and ending  at  [57].  He  makes  a  clear
    distinction, in the context which we have just outlined, between a case
    which fails to satisfy a requirement, or requirements, of the Rules  by
    a narrow margin and a case  made  under  Article  8  ECHR  in  which  a
    marginal failure of this nature is invoked by  the  claimant.   In  the
    first of  these  contexts,  the  marginal  failure  is  irrelevant.  In
    contrast, in the second context it may  be  a  relevant  consideration.
    This seems quite unexceptionable. The Article  8  claimant  whose  case
    turns on proportionality and who has a poor immigration history  and  a
    case which is decisively  non-compliant  with  the  Rules  will  almost
    invariably fare worse than the claimant whose history is one of general
    compliance and/or  marginal  non-qualification  and  non-compliance  as
    regards the Rules.  A proper appreciation of the doctrinal  basis  upon
    which this distinction rests is essential.  It has nothing to  do  with
    the now discredited "near miss" doctrine.

14. For our part we would not be prepared  to  hold  that  the  de  minimis
    principle has any application  in  a  context  where  the  question  is
    whether a requirement of the Immigration Rules has been observed.   The
    Immigration Rules and the Points Based System in  particular,  set  out
    clearly, the criteria to be met or the requirement to acquire a certain
    number of points.

15. We consider that in every such case the first task to be  performed  is
    to construe the rule  in  question.   This  exercise  is  performed  by
    applying the principles in Mahad v Entry Clearance Officer [2009]  UKSC
    16, at [10] especially (per Lord Brown).  Having  construed  the  rule,
    the next question is whether, on the facts found and/or  admitted,  the
    applicant's case complies with the relevant rule. In our judgment  this
    is a black and white question. Either the applicant satisfies the Rules
    or he does not.  No intermediate, or  third,  possibility  exists.  The
    prevalence of "bright line" provisions in  the  Immigration  Rules  has
    been  repeatedly  considered  lawful  as  they   promote   consistency,
    certainty and equality of treatment among immigrants.

16. Furthermore, we have difficulty in distinguishing both conceptually and
    logically between a minor, or minimal, failure to satisfy a  rule  (the
    discredited "near miss" principle) and the operation of the de  minimis
    principle. It seems to us that, in substance and reality, the effect of
    invoking the de minimis argument in Behary  and  the  present  case  is
    simply to espouse the discredited "near miss" principle in a  different
    guise.  No principled distinction between the two is to be found in MD,
    Miah or Behary and none was identified in  the  arguments  advanced  on
    behalf of the Appellant.

17. Our final reservation about the application of the de minimis principle
    to questions of compliance with the Immigration Rules is based  in  the
    decisions in MD and Miah.  The passages in these decisions  upon  which
    the spotlight falls invite two observations. The first  is  that  their
    treatment of the de minimis principle is fleeting at best.  The  second
    is that they are obiter.  In this respect, we wholeheartedly reject the
    argument to the contrary noted in Behary at [103].  In short, if a rule
    in the field of immigration cannot be legitimately construed as  giving
    rise  to  some  flexibility  or  discretion  or  the   possibility   of
    exceptions, it  will  normally  attract  the  familiar  appellation  of
    "bright line" and must, therefore, be given full  and  literal  effect.
    In cases where this generates harsh or austere outcomes, mitigation and
    relief are to be found by recourse to the Secretary of State's residual
    discretion to waive or modify a given requirement of the  Rules  (noted
    recently in Secretary of State for the Home Department  v  Khan  [2016]
    EWCA Civ 137, at [19]) or the possibility of making a fresh application
    for the benefit or status sought or  in  asserting  disproportionality,
    where a qualified human right is in play.

18. Given the uncompromising terms in which the  "near  miss"  or  "sliding
    scale" principle has been rejected at the highest  judicial  level,  we
    are of the opinion that  in  decision  making  contexts  involving  the
    determination of whether  compliance  with  the  Immigration  Rules  is
    demonstrated in any  given  case,  the  de  minimis  principle  has  no
    purchase. Properly analysed, it is  a  surrogate  for  its  discredited
    cousin, a mere  trespasser  straying  from  its  legitimate  sphere  of
    operation.

Decision

19. We are of the opinion that the rule in play in these proceedings is  of
    the bright line variety.  Furthermore, as our analysis above shows,  we
    disagree with the suggestion that there  is  binding  Court  of  Appeal
    authority to the contrary.  Accordingly, we conclude that the FtT erred
    in law.  The materiality of its error being beyond  plausible  dispute,
    its decision must be set aside in consequence.





The Decision Re-made

20. Given the approach  that  is  mapped  above,  there  can  only  be  one
    decision.  The Appellant's application was non-compliant  with  one  of
    the mandatory, inflexible, unforgiving requirement of  the  Rules.   It
    follows that the Secretary of State's decision  is  unassailable.   The
    decision is therefore re-made by  dismissing  the  Appellant's  appeal,
    subject to any representations in writing within 21 days of the date of
    promulgation hereof.

21. We would add that comprehensive treatment of this subject by the  Court
    of Appeal would be welcome in an appropriate case.
