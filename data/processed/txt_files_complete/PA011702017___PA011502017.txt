For the Respondent:    Ms O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of Pakistan both born in 1987.  They appeal
    against decisions of First tier Tribunal Judge Clough who  following  a
    hearing at Glasgow on 24 April 2017 dismissed their claims for asylum.


 2. The basis of the first appellant's claim is that he is a  Shia  Muslim.
    In 2002 and 2003 his  family  held  a  religious  procession  that  was
    disapproved of by the Sunnis in his area.  Trouble broke  out;  an  FIR
    was filed against his father and brother  for  attempted  murder;  they
    were  detained  for  several  days  and  beaten;  the  family  received
    threatening phone calls.  They moved to relatives in Lahore and Karachi
    and then to Sahiwal  but  the  situation  was  unchanged.   His  father
    decided the appellant should leave Pakistan.  He  arrived  on  a  visit
    visa in 2004 and overstayed.  He married the second appellant in the UK
    in 2014.  He claimed asylum in 2016.

 3. If returned he says he will be at risk from  an  organisation  such  as
    Sipah-e- Sahaba because he is a Shia Muslim.

 4. The respondent, in a decision made on 24 January 2017, did not find the
    claim credible noting various inconsistencies.   In  any  event  having
    been out of Pakistan since 2004 it was not credible he would  still  be
    sought by Sunnis  from  Sipah-e-Sahaba.   Further,  there  would  be  a
    sufficiency of protection.  Also, he could internally relocate.

 5. The basis of the second appellant's claim  is  that  she  was  forcibly
    engaged to be married by her family, particularly her brother, in 2011.
     She was threatened by her fianc�.  She left Pakistan  because  of  the
    threats, arriving in May 2014 as a  student.   She  married  the  first
    appellant within a week of her arrival.  Her  leave  was  curtailed  in
    June 2014 as she failed to study.  She claimed asylum in  August  2016.
    She fears her brother if returned.

 6. Her application was refused also on 24 January 2017.   No  evidence  of
    her being forcibly engaged was produced despite her  claiming  to  have
    been engaged in 2011.  She did not apply to study in the UK  for  three
    years despite being under  pressure  to  marry  and  being  threatened.
    Further, it was unclear why she would marry a man previously unknown to
    her a week after her arrival.  Indeed, there was a lack of detail about
    the ceremony and a lack of satisfactory documentary evidence that there
    was a marriage.

 7. Even if the account was true there would be a sufficiency of protection
    and as an educated woman she could relocate and find  work  to  support
    herself.

 8. They appealed.

    First tier hearing

 9. Following the First tier Tribunal hearing, as indicated,  Judge  Clough
    dismissed the appeals.  She did so in separate decisions.

10. In respect of the first appellant the judge chose largely not  to  make
    findings on the historic claim instead stating simply (at [17]): "I  am
    satisfied given the background evidence, even assuming the  appellant's
    claim is credible, the appellant is able to obtain state protection  in
    Pakistan and relocate to a part of the country where there is  a  large
    Shia community."

11. The judge's analysis of the second appellant's claim is  scarcely  less
    brief.  She did not find credible that  she,  a  Wahabi  Muslim,  would
    consider a form of marriage to a man without status in the UK  who  was
    an adherent of a sect inimical to her brother [23].  She did not  place
    reliance on a document purporting to show that she  had  married  under
    Islamic rites particularly as it showed them to be living at  the  same
    Glasgow address when she "by all accounts, had not moved  from  London"
    [24].

12. The judge's final paragraph [26] reads:

           "However, if I am wrong in this finding, I find the respondent's
           reasons for finding that internal relocation is available to the
           appellant and her husband for the reasons set out in the
           respondent's letter refusing the claims are correct.  I endorse
           them."


13. The appellants sought permission to appeal  which  was  granted  on  18
    December 2017.

    Error of law hearing

14. The crux  of  Mr  Martin's  submission  was  that  the  decisions  were
    inadequately reasoned, indeed almost  no  analysis  of  the  historical
    claims had been made.  It was incumbent on  the  judge  to  assess  all
    evidence in the round.  Failure to do  so  showed  a  lack  of  anxious
    scrutiny.  The first appellant would be  at  risk  as  a  member  of  a
    religious minority group.  Such would be exacerbated as  theirs  is  an
    interfaith marriage, he is Shia Muslim, she a Wahabi Muslim.  The judge
    failed to consider the implications of  such  in  her  conclusion  that
    internal relocation was reasonable.

15. Ms O'Brien's  position  was  that  the  decisions,  while  brief,  were
    sustainable.  Taken at their highest the appellants could  not  succeed
    because they could internally relocate for the reasons  stated  by  the
    judge.

16. We reserved our decision.

    Consideration

17. In considering this  matter  we  do  not  find  merit  in  Mr  Martin's
    submissions.  We consider that whilst generally it is good practice  to
    take a systematic approach to the examination of  an  asylum  claim  by
    making findings on the historical account and then going on to look  at
    the consequences in terms of risk on return, sufficiency of protection,
    and internal relocation, the judge did  not  err  in  her  approach  of
    stating that even if the accounts  were  taken  at  their  highest  the
    appeals could not succeed.

18. The first appellant's initial claim is that he would be at  risk  as  a
    Shia.  The  Country  Information  and  Guidance  Pakistan:   Background
    information, including actors of persecution, and  internal  relocation
    (which was before the judge) states that 95 percent of  the  population
    are Muslim, the majority being Sunni with a Shia minority of  about  25
    percent (para 2.3.3).   The  judge's  findings  that  even  if  he  had
    problems in his local area from Sipah-e-Sahaba  they  would  no  longer
    have an adverse interest in him 13 years later, and even if they did he
    would not be at risk and could easily take up his  life  by  relocating
    elsewhere in Pakistan are unassailable.

19. The further  strand  of  his  claim  and  in  tandem  with  the  second
    appellant's is that they are in a mixed marriage.  The judge dealt with
    that briefly in the second appellant's  decision,  not  accepting  that
    there was evidence of the marriage but even if they  are  married  they
    could relocate.

20. The Country Information (at para 2.4.2) states:

           "Because of Pakistan's size and diversity,  internal  relocation
           offers a degree of anonymity and the opportunity for victims  to
           seek refuge from discrimination or  violence.   In  most  cases,
           there are options available  for  members  of  most  ethnic  and
           religious minorities to be able to relocate to areas of relative
           safety elsewhere in Pakistan.  In particular, many  large  urban
           centres are home to mixed ethnic and religious  communities  and
           offer greater opportunities for employment, access  to  services
           and a greater degree of state protection than other areas."


21. We find that the judge's conclusion that even  if  there  is  a  mixed-
    religion marriage they can relocate is also unassailable.

22. The remaining strand is the second appellant's claim that she would  be
    at risk because she had gone against her family's wishes  in  marriage.
    Her brother had raised an FIR against her husband in, she thought,  mid
    2014 claiming he had kidnapped her.  The judge once more did  not  make
    findings on these issues but again found that even if true,  relocation
    is available.

23. Mr Martin accepted that as the second appellant would  be  regarded  as
    married under Pakistani law her  spurned  fianc�  would  no  longer  be
    interested in her.  There was only one person in  Pakistan,  a  country
    with a population of around  196  million  (Country  Information,  para
    2.3.2) who would be interested, namely, her brother.

24. Mr Martin had not been able satisfactorily to address  us  on  how  her
    brother would know she and her husband had returned  to  Pakistan.   He
    accepted that the only evidence before the judge of the existence of an
    FIR was her  assertion.   Even  if  there  was  an  FIR  there  was  no
    indication it had been registered or lodged, nor did he dispute that an
    FIR does not have effect everywhere in the country. Indeed, it does not
    have any effect at all. It is simply a record of complaint.

25. We did not find persuasive his submission that the brother could suborn
    the authorities into tracing her. Further, no evidence was produced  to
    support his submission that the appellants would have to register  with
    the authorities for accommodation and thereby be potentially traceable.

26. More fundamentally, there was no evidence before the  judge  about  any
    threats against the second appellant since she left in May 2014, nor of
    any contact by the brother  with  the  authorities  since  the  claimed
    raising of the FIR, nor of any action by the authorities to assist  the
    brother in doing harm to the appellants.  There was simply no  evidence
    that anything whatsoever had happened which  might  indicate  continued
    interest in, and risk to, the second appellant  on  the  basis  of  her
    spurning of the man chosen for her and marriage to a man  of  whom  the
    brother disapproved.

27. We conclude that the judge's conclusion that even  if  the  appellants'
    accounts were wholly true they would not be at  risk  away  from  their
    home area of Lahore and that internal relocation was available to  them
    was one which on the evidence before her she was entitled to reach.  He
    would be able to get work, and as the judge noted the second  appellant
    is an  intelligent,  educated  woman  with  work  experience.  She  was
    educated to Masters degree level and had  been  employed  as  a  school
    teacher and thus would also be able to get work if necessary.
