                                     DTI
                           (Anonymity Order Made)

                                      v

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                                  DECISION

    1. This appeal was heard by a Deputy Judge  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
       North Shields on 7 March 2016.  As explained in the Tribunal's letter
       to the parties dated 11 August 2016, the judge has  been  unwell  and
       unable to complete his written decision.

    2. According to a letter dated 17 August 2016 from Iris Law Firm:

           "... during the oral hearing SIJ Archer did dictate his decision
           orally to the parties and concluded that the decision of the FtT
           be set aside and was remitted to the FtT for a de novo hearing."



    3. Rule 40(1) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
       provides that the Upper Tribunal may give  a  decision  orally  at  a
       hearing.  Rule 40(3) provides that the Upper  Tribunal  must  provide
       written reasons for its decision with a decision  notice  unless  the
       parties have consented to  the  Upper  Tribunal  not  giving  written
       reasons.

    4. In a document dated 24 August 2016, authored by UTJ Dawson and headed
       'Memorandum and Directions' the parties were invited, on the basis of
       the terms of the aforementioned letter of  the  17  August  2016,  to
       consent to the waiver of written reasons in this case.  Both  parties
       have responded, providing such consent.

    5. The requirement for written reasons has been waived.

    6. In the circumstances, pursuant to the decision given orally by  Judge
       Archer on 7 March 2016, the FtT's decision contains an error  of  law
       and is set aside. The appeal is remitted  to  the  FtT  to  determine
       afresh.


Signed                                  Date 13 September 2016


Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor
