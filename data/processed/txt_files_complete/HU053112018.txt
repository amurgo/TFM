Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Magsino of Queen's Park Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines.  He appealed against the
    Entry Clearance Officer's decision refusing to grant leave to enter  on
    the basis of family life dated 15 January 2018.

 2. In a decision promulgated on 29 May 2019, Judge Scott-Baker (the judge)
    dismissed the appellant's appeal.  She found that the  appellant  could
    not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules and that as  regards
    Article 8, the respondent's decision was  proportionate.   The  grounds
    claim the judge:

         "(a) made perverse or irrational findings on  matters  material  to
             the outcome;

         (b)  failed to give reasons or any adequate reasons for findings on
             material matters;

         (c)  failed to take into account and/or resolve conflicts  of  fact
             or opinion on material matters;

         (d)   made  a  mistake  as  to  a  material  fact  which  could  be
             established by objective and uncontentious evidence, where the
             appellant and/or his advisors were  not  responsible  for  the
             mistake and where unfairness resulted from  the  fact  that  a
             mistake was made".

 3. Judge Chohan granted permission to appeal in a decision dated  21  June
    2019.  He said inter alia as follows:

         "2.  In short, it is argued that the judge erred in the  assessment
             of the sponsor's financial circumstances and in the Article  8
             assessment.

         3.   In particular, the grounds state that the judge failed to take
             into account the sponsor's self-employment income  of  �58,822
             for 2016 and �22,313 for 2017.  It does seem, when  one  looks
             at the judge's decision, that there is no  reference  to  such
             income.  In all other respects, the judge has prepared a well-
             written decision but, it may be  open  to  argument  that  the
             judge failed to take into account relevant evidence, which may
             have had a material bearing on the outcome of the appeal".

Submissions on Error of Law

 4. Mr Magsino relied upon the grounds and his skeleton argument  dated  21
    July 2019.  Mr Tarlow submitted that the judge had not erred.

Conclusion on Error of Law

 5. The judge made a crucial finding at [34] of her decision inter alia:

         "It was accepted that the appellant could not  meet  the  financial
         requirements under Appendix FM-SE".

 6. The whole thrust of ground 1 and confirmed to me by Mr Magsino was that
    the  judge  had  erred  because  the  appellant   met   the   financial
    requirements.

 7. There was no challenge by Mr Magsino to [34] of the decision either  in
    the grounds or before me.  In such circumstances, ground 1 falls away.

 8. The judge carried out a  careful  and  comprehensive  analysis  of  the
    financial circumstances.  She had adjourned the appeal from 17 December
    to give the sponsor every opportunity of producing additional financial
    information and for the respondent to review the  same.   It  is  clear
    that in the course of the hearing as the judge recited at [34], it  was
    accepted that the appellant could not meet the  financial  requirements
    of Appendix FM-SE.

 9. Judge Chohan found no arguable error with regard to the judge's Article
    8 assessment but I have considered it nevertheless.  The judge accepted
    the relationship of father and son with the appellant and  child.   She
    found that family life had been enjoyed by the appellant but that  such
    family life had been enjoyed  in  a  fragmented  fashion;  the  sponsor
    continued to reside in the United Kingdom whilst her partner  lived  in
    the Philippines where she visits him.  The judge commented  that  there
    was no evidence that the child  accompanied  the  appellant  on  return
    visits.

10. The judge took into account that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of either the partner or parent route.

11. The child was a little over 2 years of age.  He has always  lived  here
    with the sponsor.  The judge found that the child's best interests were
    not negatively impacted by the respondent's decision.

12. No family or private life had been enjoyed  by  the  appellant  in  the
    United Kingdom.  The judge found  the  refusal  merely  maintained  the
    status quo.

13. The judge considered the circumstances in light of the appropriate case
    law Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11.  The grounds refer to various case law  but
    fail to explain how it is that  they  are  relevant  in  terms  of  the
    particular circumstances of the appeal before the judge.

14. The judge commented at [41] of her decision that it  was  open  to  the
    appellant to make a further application with clear evidential  support.
    I said the same to Mr Magsino at the error of law hearing before me.

15. The judge did not err in dismissing the appeal.  Her  decision  stands.



    No anonymity direction is made.
