Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr Hussain of Syed Solicitors.
For the Respondent: Mr Smart - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge V Osborne promulgated on the 4th February 2014 in  which  she
        dismissed the appeal against a direction  dated  1st  August  2013,
        made under section 10 Immigration and  Asylum  Act  1999,  for  the
        Appellants removal to Pakistan.


     2. Permission to appeal was granted  on  the  ground  challenging  the
        Judge's findings in relation to  Article  8.   The  Judge  accepted
        there was a genuine relationship  between  the  Appellant  and  his
        partner but found the decision  proportionate.   It  was  submitted
        this  is  a  finding  contradicted  by  other   findings   in   the
        determination [para 13,25,26,27 and 30].



Error of law


     3. Mr Bhatti's immigration history shows he entered the  UK  in  2003.
        His wife and their four children had entered in 2002.  She  claimed
        asylum with the children as dependants and were eventually  granted
        IRL.


     4. Mr Bhatti made no application on entry and in 2005 was  encountered
        and detained as an illegal entrant. He then  claimed  asylum  which
        was refused and became appeal rights exhausted  in  November  2005.
        Further submissions received from Mr Bhatti were  refused  in  June
        2006 after which he failed  to  honour  reporting  conditions.   Mr
        Bhatti was encountered again by the police on 5th  March  2008.  He
        then applied for his case to be considered under the Legacy scheme.
        A decision was made by the Respondent on 1st August 2013,  refusing
        his claim to be entitled to remain in the UK on the  basis  of  his
        human rights, with a full right of appeal. It is this appeal  which
        came before Judge Osborne.


     5. The Judge carefully considered the relevant evidence and noted that
        Mr Bhatti met his current partner in January  2011  and  that  they
        married according to Islamic law on 7th March 2011. The evidence of
        both Mr Bhatti and his partner was that neither could live on their
        own. The Judge made a number of other relevant findings that can be
        summarised as follows:


              i.  The 'marriage' between Mr Bhatti and his current  wife  is
   based                   largely upon a mutual need for companionship  and
   support [13].


              ii. The most up to date medical report from  the  partners  GP
   records                 that she suffers from a number of conditions.


              iii.     Mr Bhatti's partner's  cash  and  carry  business  is
   being closed down as                  a result of her health issues [16].


              iv. Mr  Bhatti  has  close  family  members  still  living  in
   Pakistan, contrary               to his assertions [19].


              v.  There is some limited evidence Mr Bhatti and  his  partner
   live                    together at 128 Nab Lane,  as  claimed,  although
   most of the                      documents containing this address are in
   Mr Bhatti's name [22].


              vi. Little weight could be placed  upon  four  documents  from
   individuals                  purporting to know Mr Bhatti and his partner
   and to  have  attended                   the  'wedding'  for  the  stated
   reasons [23].


              vii.     The Judge was satisfied from  photographs  and  other
   evidence that                an Islamic marriage ceremony did take  place
   very shortly after the                couple met but this is not evidence
   they live together as claimed [24].


              viii.    There is no evidence from neighbours  or  people  who
   may meet the                 couple on a day-to day basis confirming they
   live together. A letter                   from a former  landlord  states
   they lived at a named address from                 March 2011 to May 2012
   and evidence has been produced  relating  to                   a  current
   tenancy.  On  balance   it   has   been   proved   they   live   in   the
   same properly [25].


              ix. An analysis  of  the  Article  8  claim  under  the  Rules
   (Appendix FM                  and  276ADE)  is  not  appropriate  as  the
   application was made long                 before the changes to the Rules
   came into effect. Article 8 needs  to  be                 assessed  under
   Article 8 ECHR [26].


              x.  It is accepted the couple are married under  Islamic  law.
   They cannot                  marry under English  law  as  Mr  Bhatti  is
   still married and not yet                 divorced [26].


              xi. The parties live in the same property. The nature  of  the
   relationship                  is  based  upon  their  mutual   need   for
   companionship and the wife's                  need  for  assistance  with
   her health conditions [27].


              xii.     The wife suffers from serious and multiple conditions
   for which she                is likely to need  assistance  in  both  the
   administration   of   medication,                    the    keeping    of
   appointments,     mobility     issues,     and     emotional      support
   [28].


              xiii.    Mr Bhatti has done various things in  an  attempt  to
   ensure his                       continued residence in the UK. His claim
   to suffer medical conditions                  set out in his  grounds  of
   appeal is unsupported by any medical                    evidence  and  in
   his statement he says he is a person of sound  health.                 Mr
   Bhatti  attempted  to  mislead  the  Tribunal  in  claiming  to  have  no
     family connection to Pakistan whereas  one  of  his  daughters  clearly
          contradicted this in her evidence [29].


              xiv.     The key question is whether the relationship  between
   Mr Bhatti and                his wife is a genuine  marital  relationship
   or one he has entered into                for his own ends? [30].


              xv. The relationships between Mr  Bhatti,  his  children,  and
   grandchildren                do not amount to family life  recognised  by
   Article 8. All his children               are adults  and  they  are  the
   primary cares for  the  grandchildren.  It                 had  not  been
   proved    that    the    welfare    of    either    group    would     be
   significantly disrupted by his absence. His wife  is  a  British  citizen
          with access to the NHS. It is accepted it  is  not  reasonable  to
   expect                  her to relocate to Pakistan [31].


              xvi.     On the balance of probabilities it has not been shown
   that the                     relationship between Mr Bhatti and his  wife
   is such that it should be                 protected by confirmation  that
   he has a right to family life with his                  wife  in  the  UK
   [31].


              xvii.    No family life  recognised  by  Article  8  has  been
   proved  and  so  it  is                    unnecessary  to  consider  the
   proportionality issue [32].


              xviii.   In relation to his private life; Mr  Bhatti  provided
   no detail of  his                       private  life  and  there  is  no
   independent evidence to confirm  the                 nature  of  it.  Any
   private life he has, has been developed at a time he                  had
   no leave to remain and  it  has  not  been  established  that  Mr  Bhatti
     has a private life within the meaning of Article 8 [34].


     6. On behalf of Mr Bhatti it is argued that as the Judge did not  find
        the marriage to be a sham marriage her findings are  contradictory.
        It was accepted in paragraph 13 that the marriage was based upon  a
        need for  mutual  support  which  conflicts  with  the  finding  in
        paragraph 31. It is said the Judges  findings  are  irrational.  Mr
        Smart challenges this and referred in his submissions  to  a  'Jack
        Spratt' type relationship.


     7. The Judge did find the marriage to be based upon a mutual  need  in
        paragraph 13 and that there was evidence  of  living  in  the  same
        household. The Judge does not find the parties live as man and wife
        in the same household just that they occupied  the  same  property.
        The Judge later in  the  determination  crystallises  her  thinking
        where she finds that Mr Bhatti's motives are not genuine. There  is
        nothing inherently contradictory with such a finding when  all  the
        relevant evidence is considered together. There  are  a  number  of
        concerns noted by the Judge and Mr Bhatti was found to have lied to
        the Tribunal in relation to his own health needs and lack  of  ties
        to Pakistan. He was  found  not  to  be  credible.   The  need  for
        companionship and support, so far as Mr Bhatti  is  concerned,  was
        found to be that to enable him to remain in the UK whereas for  his
        wife it relates to her personal needs. It is not a marriage in  the
        full sense in which such a relationship  is  ordinarily  understood
        but only a mutual relationship. Whilst I accept that  companionship
        marriages do exist, where the parties have entered the relationship
        in the full understanding that is all they want and expect this  is
        not the claim made by Mr Bhatti. He claimed he has a valid and full
        marriage which was not substantiated by the evidence.


     8. Mr Hussain was asked to address the Tribunal  in  relation  to  the
        outcome if it had been found that the marriage was as  alleged.  He
        submitted Mr Bhatti is able to succeed under the Rules for although
        he is unable to succeed under the 'partner route' of  Appendix  FM,
        as a result of an inability to satisfy the suitability or financial
        requirements, he can succeed under EX.1. based upon  the  existence
        of insurmountable obstacles to his wife relocating.


     9. I find there is legal error in the determination for  at  paragraph
        26 the Judge stated the Respondent's assessment under the  Rule  is
        'not appropriate' as the application was made before 9th July 2012.
        She then proceeded to determine the appeal under Article 8 ECHR  as
        a result, although such error may not be material.


    10. The application was made prior to the introduction of  the  current
        version of the Rules and additional information sought in  December
        2011 and April 2013. It is not suggested the application  was  made
        under a provision of the Rules that existed pre 9th July 2012.   It
        is an application that relies upon a claim outside the Rules  under
        Article 8 ECHR.


    11. The decision is dated 1st August 2013 when the current  version  of
        the Rules was in force.  Odelola v SSHD [2009] UKHL 25 is authority
        for  the  proposition  that,  absent  specific  provisions  to  the
        contrary, it is the Rules in force at the date  of  decision  which
        are to be applied.  The Rules in force on 1st August 2013  set  out
        those elements of the pre-9th July 2012 Rules which remain relevant
        to  applications  made  but  not  decided  prior  to  the  changes.




    12. The Rules were amended in September and later in December  2013  to
        include a provision that the Respondent can apply the provisions of
        the post 9th July 2012 Rules to any case, even if a  pre  9th  July
        2012 application,  if she sees fit. In this case it  has  not  been
        established that there are  any  relevant  applicable  transitional
        provisions as it has not been shown that an  application  was  made
        under the previous provisions of  the  Rules  that  applies  to  Mr
        Bhatti's circumstances. The Rules in force at the date of  decision
        are those applied by the Respondent to  which  reference  could  be
        made to inform her in relation  to  the  proper  interpretation  of
        Article 8, in any event.


    13. The submission the appeal could have succeeded under  EX.1  on  the
        basis of insurmountable obstacles has no arguable merit.  In  Sabir
        (Appendix FM - EX.1 not free standing) [2014] UKUT 63 (IAC) it  was
        held that the architecture of the Rules as regards partners is such
        that EX.1 is "parasitic" on the relevant Rule  within  Appendix  FM
        that otherwise grants leave to remain. If EX.1 was intended to be a
        free- standing element some mechanism of identification would  have
        been used. The structure of the Rules as presently drafted requires
        it to be a component part of the leave granting Rule. This  is  now
        made plain by the respondent's guidance dated October 2013.


    14. I accept in paragraph 10 that the inclusion of the word "not" is  a
        typing error as  clearly  the  claim  is  based  upon  Mr  Bhatti's
        relationship with his second 'wife'.


    15. The Judge accepted Mr  Bhatti  and  his  'wife'  had  undertaken  a
        ceremony and lived in the same house but not that this is a genuine
        marriage. The Rules allow Mr  Bhatti  to  rely  upon  EX.1  if  the
        eligibility but not suitability requirements can  be  met,  but  in
        this case they cannot. In Appendix FM, 'Definitions'GEN.1.2. it  is
        stated that for the purposes of this Appendix "partner" means-
          (i)     the applicant's spouse;
          (ii)    the applicant's civil partner;
          (iii)   the applicant's fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner; or
          (iv)    a person who has been living together with the applicant
   in a relationship            akin to a marriage or civil partnership for
   at least two years prior to the           date of application,
              unless the context otherwise requires.


    16. There was no application under Appendix  FM  but  the  Tribunal  is
        required to apply the provisions as a result of 276A0 and Gen  1.9.
        As the formal requirements for there to be a partner have not  been
        shown to have been met the  application  fails  under  this  route.
        Also, in relation to suitability, Mr Smart submitted S-LTR  2.2  is
        relevant.  S-LTR.2.1 states that  an  applicant  will  normally  be
        refused on grounds of suitability if any of  paragraphs  S-LTR.2.2.
        to 2.4. apply.  S-LTR.2.2.  states  that  whether  or  not  to  the
        applicant's knowledge -
         (a)  false information,  representations  or  documents  have  been
submitted  in            relation  to  the  application   (including   false
information submitted to any            person to obtain a document used  in
support of the application); or
         (b)  there has  been  a  failure  to  disclose  material  facts  in
relation to the                 application.

    17. In paragraph 29 of the determination the Judge found that Mr Bhatti
        had  attempted  to  mislead  the  Tribunal   and   provided   false
        information. This is a sustainable finding on the facts.


    18. I reject Mr Hussain's submission that Mr Bhatti is able to meet the
        suitability requirements and cannot meet the eligibility solely  as
        a result of the fact he has no valid leave. Such  a  submission  is
        not supported by the evidence. The submissions that the  breach  of
        2.2 is a minor discrepancy is an attempt to argue a 'near miss' but
        there is no such legal concept as confirmed by the Supreme Court in
        Patel. There has been an attempt to mislead the First-tier  by  the
        provision of information which has been  proved  to  be  false.  Mr
        Bhatti did so deliberately and so is culpable.  It  is  also  clear
        from paragraph 29 that there was more than one attempt to mislead.


    19. It is clear that had the Judge applied the provisions of the  Rules
        as  they  stood  at  the  date  of  decision,   absent   applicable
        transitional provisions to the contrary, Mr Bhatti will have failed
        under the Rules. Any failure to do so is therefore not material  to
        the decision to dismiss the appeal.


    20. Having considered the submissions made, the evidence available, and
        relevant legal principles, I find no legal error  material  to  the
        decision to dismiss the appeal has been proved.


Decision

    21. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.


Anonymity.


    22. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules
        2005. I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
