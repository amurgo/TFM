                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Bunting, instructed by Edward Marshall
Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr Whitwell, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS


     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
        Tribunal Judge Burns promulgated on  1  December  2020,  which  the
        Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal on human rights grounds.
     2. Permission to appeal was granted by another judge of the First-tier
        Tribunal on the basis it was said to be arguable that the Judge had
        failed to make findings on an issue before him, referred to as "the
        second gap" which was  a  material  issue  to  be  decided  on  the
        evidence.
     3. The Judge noted the appellant had applied for ILR on the  basis  of
        long residence and family and private life, which was refused on 30
        April 2019 on the basis the  requirements  of  paragraph  276B  and
        276ADE of the Immigration Rules were not met, and that  there  were
        no exceptional circumstances warranting a grant of  leave  pursuant
        to article 8 ECHR.
     4. In relation to 276B  requiring  the  appellant  to  have  10  years
        continuous lawful residence in the United Kingdom at  the  relevant
        date, it was said there were two breaks in the  appellant's  lawful
        residence, being from 31 January 2010 to 7 July 2010 as a result of
        an application made within time having been rejected as  not  being
        valid, therefore not conferring the benefit  of  section  3C  leave
        upon the appellant, and a second gap referred to by  the  Judge  at
        [28 - 29] in the following terms:


        28.  The Respondent identified a second break  in  the  Appellant's
             continuous lawful residence as follows "Following  your  grant
             of leave to remain on 7 July 2010, you held lawful leave until
             16 June 2013. You did not seek to vary your leave on  14  June
             2013,  this  application  was  refused  and   following   your
             unsuccessful appeal. Your appeal rights were  exhausted  on  7
             August 2014. Your next grant of leave was in fact not until 30
             March 2015. So it is noted that  between  the  exploration  of
             your leave and your next grant was a period of 234 days."


        29.  The Appellant's response to this is as follows "My application
             dated 4/9/14 was rejected on 21/2/15.... however I varied this
             application on 12/2/15 (which means I varied my application, 9
             days  before  my  ...  application  was   rejected   ...   the
             application dated 4/9/14 was varied once again  and  leave  to
             remain was granted till 3/5/18. This means I have valid  leave
             from 4/4/14 till  3/5/18....  My  further  applications  after
             3/5/18 were varied until my ILR  application  was  refused  on
             30/4/19."


     5. The Judge at [31] noted the appellant's submission was that the 27-
        day gap between becoming appeal rights exhausted 7/8/2014  and  the
        application dated 4/9/14 must be disregarded and that the period up
        to 3/5/18 is covered by 3C leave, which the Judge found it was  not
        necessary to consider in light of the decision about the first  gap
        in the appellant's period of leave.
6. At [33] the Judge writes:


         33.      For the avoidance of doubt, even if I had  concluded  that
             the Appellant was correct about the second claimed gap, (which
             would mean that he did not have the requisite 10  year  period
             as at 26/2/19, but does have it now. At the time of his appeal
             hearing), I would not have thought it appropriate to allow the
             appeal on this basis. Indeed, Mr Hussein did not submit that I
             should. The Appellant's  remedy  in  that  case  would  be  to
             reapply, ensuring that he complies with all  the  elements  of
             the rules that the application date, a  matter  which  is  not
             within my purview.


     7. The error in relation to the second  gap  noted  in  the  grant  of
        permission was conceded by the Secretary of State in  her  Rule  24
        reply with a suggestion, the matter should be retained  within  the
        Upper Tribunal with certain suggested preserved findings.
     8. Mr Bunting on behalf of the appellant filed a skeleton argument  in
        which he submits in relation to the second gap:


        Submissions
        'Second Gap'
        1. As is accepted by the respondent, the failure to make a  finding
           on the 'second gap' is a material error of law.


        2. It is clear that it is the second gap that would always  be  the
           critical one given that without that  the  appellant  would  not
           have  been  able  to  accrue   ten   years   lawful   residence,
           irrespective of the conclusion on the first gap.

        3. For that reason, it is submitted that it is appropriate to start
           with that point.

        4. It was not in dispute that the appellant had leave from 07  July
           2010  until  07  August  2014  when  he  became  appeal   rights
           exhausted. The next grant was on 30 March 2015, with the  period
           of time between the latter two dates being 234  days  (excluding
           30 March 2015).

        5. Since Hoque, there have been two further Upper Tribunal cases of
           note : Muneeb Asif   (Paragraph  276B  -  disregard  -  previous
           overstaying) [2021] UKUT 96 (IAC) and R (Waseem & Others) v SSHD
           (long residence policy - interpretation) [2021] UKUT 146 (IAC).

        6. Both of these were decided after the determination in this case.



        7. In Asif, the facts are set out at paras 22-25.  In  brief,  that
           appellant had valid leave, but an application  to  vary  it  was
           refused. An appeal was lodged, but this was withdrawn on 03 July
           2014.

        8. A fresh application was made on 25 July 2014 (within  28  days).
           This was refused but, after litigation, it  was  granted  on  23
           November 2015. There was a gap of 507 days between 03 July  2014
           and 23 November 2015.

        9. The Upper Tribunal held that  that  appellant  fell  within  the
           terms of para 276B(1)(v)(a). In those circumstances, the  period
           of overstaying of 507 days was treated as lawful residence.

       10. It is submitted that this appellant's case is on fours with  the
           principles of Asif. In those circumstances, irrespective of  the
           first gap, the appellant had accrued 10 years  lawful  residence
           on 06 July 2020.

       11. If the appellant meets the Immigration Rules then, following  TZ
           (Pakistan) & PG (India) v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 1109, the  appeal
           should be allowed on article 8 grounds.

     9. On behalf of the Secretary of State Mr Whitwell  accepted  that  in
        light of the current case law it  had  been  established  that  the
        appellant had achieved 10 years continuous lawful residence in  the
        United Kingdom as required by the Immigration Rules.  It  was  also
        accepted, on that basis, that the weight to be given to the  public
        interest  assessment  as  part  of  the  balancing   exercise   was
        substantially reduced and that on the facts the Secretary of  State
        could not sustain an argument that  it  will  be  proportionate  to
        remove the appellant from the United Kingdom  when  there  were  no
        other countervailing factors.
    10. On that basis I find the First-tier Judge has erred  in  law  in  a
        manner material to the decision to dismiss the appeal. I  set  that
        decision aside.  I  substitute  a  decision  to  allow  the  appeal
        pursuant to article 8 ECHR.


Decision

    11. The Judge materially erred in law. I  set  the  decision  aside.  I
        substitute a decision to allow the appeal.

   Anonymity.


    12. The First-tier Tribunal made no order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008.
