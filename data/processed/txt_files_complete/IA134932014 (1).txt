For the Appellant:     Mr Pennington-Benton instructed by Denning
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against  a  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Cohen, promulgated following a hearing at Taylor  House  on  24
       October 2014, in which the appellants appeal against the  refusal  of
       leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and direction  for
       his removal made pursuant  to  section  47  Immigration,  Asylum  and
       Nationality Act 2006 was dismissed.

    2. The judge noted at paragraph 13 "The appellant was frequently evasive
       in respect of the evidence that he gave before me. He failed to  give
       accurate descriptions of the claimed business activities that he  had
       undertaken on a self-employed basis".  At paragraph 17  it  is  noted
       "The appellant was an extremely unimpressive witness before me and in
       his Tier 1 interview".

    3. The appellant sought permission to appeal on a number of grounds  the
       first of which is an allegation of a lack of fairness and bias in the
       conduct of the hearing.

    4. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal McDade in the
       following terms:

           "It  is  arguable  that  if  the  Appellant's   representative's
           assertion are made out that the judge has made an error of  law.
           However at the error of law hearing it  is  incumbent  upon  the
           Appellant's representative to adduce  evidence  of  the  judge's
           conduct as mere assertions  without  more  are  unlikely  to  be
           accepted at face value.  There is an arguable error of law."

Error of law


    5. Ground 1, asserting a lack of fairness and/or bias makes reference to
       the manner in which the judge  conducted  the  hearing  alleging  the
       following:

           "10.   The judge then asked the Appellant  questions  about  his
                clients and the services he provided as  an  IT  consultant.
                Some  questions  took  the   form   of   aggressive   cross-
                examination. Two examples the Appellant will rely on are:

                 1) The judge asked the Appellant  what  he  did  for  Abdul
                    Majid Ahmed. The Appellant said he could  not  remember.
                    The judge asked the Appellant who Abdul Majid Ahmed was.
                    The Appellant responded that Abdul Majid was one of  his
                    clients. The judge than asked the Appellant to  look  at
                    Invoice No. AK/AB001 dated 18 January 2013 (one  of  the
                    invoices the  Appellant  submitted  in  support  of  his
                    application).  This judge pointed out that  this  showed
                    the Appellant charged �1,160 for 'MS Word 2007  Training
                    Course'.  The  judge  asked   the   Appellant,   in   an
                    incredulous and hostile tone, why would someone pay that
                    much for such training when they could get the  training
                    for free by going to college?

                 2)  The  judge  referred  the  Appellant  to  Invoice   No.
                    AK/ABD0002 to Abdul Majid Ahmed dated 16 April 2013. The
                    invoice referred to  'System  check-up  and  Upgrade  -2
                    laptops' for a  sum  of  �1,050.  The  judge  asked  the
                    Appellant, again in an incredulous and hostile tone, why
                    would someone pay that much (for an upgrade)  when  they
                    could get two new laptops for the same money.

           11.    Indeed, the judge's incredulity was  evidence  throughout
                the time he was  asking  the  Appellant  questions  and  his
                manner overbearing and at times hostile.

           ...

           14.    The judge's questions (particularly those set out in para
                10 above) were entirely improper both in  terms  of  content
                and the manner in which they were asked.  They  amounted  to
                cross-examination of the Appellant. The judge descended into
                the arena and did so in a hostile/aggressive  manner  and  a
                manner suggesting his mind had been made up.

           ...

           16.    Accordingly the Appellant did not receive a fair hearing.
                Further or alternatively, the judge's  questions  (including
                his manner) displayed apparent bias.  In  other  words,  the
                fair minded and informed observer, having considered all the
                circumstances, would conclude there was a  real  possibility
                of bias (Porter v Magill [2001] UKHL 67). Specifically  pre-
                determination  (meaning  the  premature   formation   of   a
                concluded view adverse to one party; Amjad  v  Stedman-Byrne
                [2007] 1 WLR 2482.)"

    6. Ground 2 asserts a mistake of fact in the determination and Ground  3
       an assertion of inadequate reasons.

    7. Judge Cohen was invited to make comment  upon  the  allegations.  His
       response is in the following terms:

           "1.    No complaint against my conduct was made on  the  day  of
                the hearing or until the date of appeal. If my behaviour was
                as claimed, one would have expected a complaint to  be  made
                before the grounds of appeal.

             2. I deny acting with hostility towards the appellant.

             3. I invite you to contact the Home Office  Presenting  Officer
                involved in the case, Ms Ayodele, and ask if my conduct  was
                in any way biased, hostile or unprofessional.

             4. I do not believe  that  number  of  questions  I  asked  was
                excessive or that I entered into the arena and my  questions
                flowed from the evidence before me.

             5. The appellant did identify some clients merely by the use of
                one name and I invite  careful  scrutiny  of  his  interview
                record.

             6. I believe that I provided detailed reasons for my decision.

             7. I question the appellant's actions in  credibility  both  in
                interview and in respect of his  actions,  controlling  five
                bank accounts and transferring money  between  them  and  in
                respect of his vague and evasive responses before me."

    8. The Tribunal has received a witness statement from Hafsah Masood  who
       represented the appellant before Judge Cohen. Ms Masood was called to
       the bar in 2006 and practices from 3 Hare Court, Temple.

    9. Ms Masood outlines the proceeding on the day and makes the  following
       observations:

           "10.   The judge began  by  asking  Mr  Kashem  some  open-ended
                questions: what did you do for Arif Aktar? What did  you  do
                for Abdul Majid? Who is he? Although the judge's tone was  a
                little clipped, there was nothing that caused  me  any  real
                concern at this stage.

           11.    The judge then asked Mr Kashem to turn to an  invoice  in
                the Respondent's bundle. This was an  invoice  to  Mr  Abdul
                Majid Ahmed dated 18 January 2013  and  appears  at  Exhibit
                HM3. The judge pointed out that  it  showed  Mr  Kashem  had
                charged �1,160 for a MS word 2007 training course and  a  MS
                Excel 2007 training course. The judge then asked Mr  Kashem,
                with a raised voice and in an incredulous  tone:  why  would
                someone pay �1,160 for excel and  word  training  when  they
                could get it for free by going to college?  Although  framed
                as a question, it came across more like a comment,  and  the
                judge's manner when asking the question (the combination  of
                the  raised  voice  and   incredulity)   was   unfortunately
                hostile."

   10. Mr Bramble has provided  a  witness  statement  from  the  Presenting
       Officer who represented the Secretary of State on the day who  states
       "Throughout the hearing I cannot  recall  the  IJ  being  overbearing
       and/or hostile in his questions to the appellant".

   11. A witness statement provided by the appellant claims  he  was  denied
       the opportunity to 'defend his case'. It is alleged the  judge  asked
       irrelevant question, asked no questions about the  replies  given  at
       interview yet relied upon this to assess the appellant's credibility.
       At paragraphs 6 of the statement the appellant states:

           "6.    Unfortunate, I did not get the chance to explain all this
                to the IJ as he kept interjecting.  I also found him  to  be
                quite  aggressive  and  hostile  towards  me.   During   the
                proceedings I became very nervous and felt intimidated."

   12. The  appellant  challenges  the  accuracy  of  paragraph  18  of  the
       determination claiming  the  statement  he  was  unable  to  give  an
       explanation about the services he provided for his clients  is  wrong
       and it fails to record the correct version of the answers he gave.

Discussion


   13. In paragraph 7 of Mr  Pennington-Benton's  skeleton  argument  it  is
       written:

           "It is important to point out at  the  outset  (if  not  already
           obvious) that the Appellant makes no personal criticism  of  the
           Judge.  There is no accusation of  actual  bias.  The  Appellant
           simply argues that, taken in the round, and for the reasons  set
           out in more detail below, the hearing did not  accord  with  the
           rightly high standards of procedural fairness (including  public
           perception of fairness) that as part of the civil justice system
           in England and Wales they really ought."

   14. In paragraphs 9 and 10, which sum up  the  heart  of  the  appellants
       case, it is written:

           "9.    The Appellant left the hearing  with  a  justified  sense
                that the Judge may not have approached his case with an open
                mind. It  is  submitted  that,  upon  consideration  of  the
                evidence that the court will hear from  Ms  Masood,  and  in
                light of the Appellant's obvious emotional response  to  the
                questioning, the objective observer  would  have  been  left
                with the impression that the Judge may have already made  up
                his mind.  The incredulity with which the  Judge  approached
                the Appellant's evidence is further unlikely  to  have  been
                viewed as a genuine attempt to understand his evidence.

           10.    As noted  above  it  is  not  suggested  that  the  Judge
                intended or was even aware that his  manner  and  tone  were
                either hostile or expressing incredulity.   It  was  however
                clear to those in attendance that this was the way  it  came
                across.  Apparent bias is of course  all  about  perception;
                how the matter would look to members of the public observing
                proceedings."

   15. The tests for determining bias adopted  by  the  House  of  Lords  in
       Porter and Another v Magill (2001) UKHL  67  was  "whether  the  fair
       minded and informed observer,  having  considered  the  facts,  would
       conclude that there was a real  possibility  that  the  Tribunal  was
       biased." In Helo v SSHD (2008) UKHL 62 the House of Lords added  that
       the fair minded and informed observer was the sort of person who  was
       able to put whatever she had read  or  seen  in  its  overall  social
       political and geographical context and who was neither complacent nor
       unduly sensitive or  suspicious.  It  was  added  that  there  was  a
       presumption that judges would carry out their judicial duty.

   16. As noted in the skeleton argument it is not being asserted this is  a
       case of actual bias but of perceived bias.

   17. Judge Cohen was right to observe that no complaint had been raised on
       the day, a fact confirmed by Ms Masood who indicated she had concerns
       but failed to raise them at the  time.  In  KD  (Inattentive  Judges)
       Afghanistan  [2010]  UKUT  261  (IAC)  the  Tribunal  found  it   was
       preferable for any concerns about behaviour  or  inattention  of  the
       Judge to be raised at the hearing. Whilst this may be so,  a  failure
       to do so is not determinative of the issue. It was also found  in  KD
       that when such a ground of appeal is raised, it  is  only  likely  to
       succeed if there is cogent evidence of the actual apparent  behaviour
       in question.   In  this  matter  the  Tribunal  has  the  appellant's
       account, that of his barrister on the day, the  Presenting  Officer's
       statement and Judge Cohen's response. It is settled law that a  party
       alleging  judicial  misconduct  needs   to   prove   it   and   their
       representatives need to ensure that the evidence is  collected  while
       memories are fresh.  The hearing occurred on  24  October  2014.  The
       Presenting Officer's statement is  dated  23  June  2015  based  upon
       personal  recollection  of  the  events.  The   appellant's   witness
       statement (number 2) is dated 20 April 2015. Ms Masood's statement is
       dated 16 April 2015 making reference to contemporaneous  notes  taken
       at the  hearing  and  more  detailed  notes  prepared  on  return  to
       Chambers, copies of which are annexed to the statement, and supported
       by her oral evidence at the hearing. Judge Cohen's reply is  dated  9
       July 2015.

   18. The Tribunal is able to rely upon the evidence provided in support of
       the claim. Whilst some may think an appellant who has lost  his  case
       may have a vested interest in claiming bias or an unfair  hearing  no
       such allegation can be made in relation to the evidence of Ms  Masood
       who  remains  professionally  neutral  in  relation  to  the  matter,
       presenting the facts as she recalls them on the day.

   19. Judge Cohen is an experienced judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  who
       has heard a considerable number of appeals in his time  and  who  may
       form a view of the merits of the case during the course  of  his  pre
       hearing preparation. In this case it is  noted  the  matter  was  not
       originally listed in Judge Cohen's fixed list  but  was  taken  as  a
       float case.

   20. There can be no complaint if a judge forms a preliminary view of  the
       evidence as the role of a  judge  is  to  assess  the  materiel  made
       available and the merits of a claim against  the  fact  accepted  and
       applicable law. There is no guidance stating that such a process  can
       only be undertaken at  the  end  of  the  hearing  although  fairness
       dictates that any final decision as to the merits is not  made  until
       all the evidence has  been  heard  and  considered,  from  a  neutral
       perspective, with the required degree of anxious scrutiny.

   21. If a preliminary view has been formed a judge can either  inform  the
       parties and invite submissions to demonstrate why this is  incorrect,
       or not as the case may be, or keep such thoughts to  him  or  herself
       and  hear  the  case  following  which  the   preliminary   view   is
       reconsidered in light of the evidence now  available.  What  a  judge
       cannot and must not do is to form a preliminary view  of  the  merits
       and then close his or her mind to there being any other outcome. When
       it was said in Helo v SSHD that there is a presumption a judge  would
       do his job, that is a reference to the judge siting as a fair  minded
       impartial assessor,  willing  and  able  to  hear  and  consider  the
       evidence and submissions made, and to only form a final  view  as  to
       the merits of the case before them once  the  parties  have  had  the
       opportunity to put their cases in full.

   22. In this case it is not suggested Judge Cohen deliberately set out  to
       prevent the appellant putting his case but that  his  conduct  during
       the hearing had that effect. Judge Cohen has a reputation  for  being
       firm and direct in his approach to cases he is required to  hear  and
       whilst there is nothing wrong with a robust approach being  taken  it
       is important a judge does not cross the line between  effective  case
       management, controlling the evidence and making  best  use  of  court
       time, and becoming a bar to the proper administration of justice.

   23. It is not suggested what is said to have happened is deliberate  but,
       even if this is so, it gives rise to concern as it may be  indicative
       of a pattern of conduct that  subconsciously  is  preventing  a  fair
       hearing.

   24. The weight of evidence clearly indicates something went wrong at  the
       hearing before Judge Cohen on the 24 October 2014. The  result  is  a
       perception the appellant did not receive a fair  hearing.  It  is  an
       established principle that justice must not only  been  done  but  be
       seen to  be  done.   The  perception  of  a  procedural  irregularity
       sufficient to amount to a material error of  law  in  the  manner  in
       which the hearing was conducted is made out.

   25. The determination shall be set aside in full and the case remitted to
       the First-tier Tribunal sitting at Taylor House to be  reheard  by  a
       salaried judge of the Tribunal other than Judge Cohen

Decision

   26. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law.  I  set  aside
       the decision of the original Judge. I remit the appeal to the  First-
       tier Tribunal sitting at Taylor House to be heard by a salaried judge
       nominated by the Resident Judge other than Judge Cohen.

   Anonymity

   27. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule
       45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules
       2005.

       I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
