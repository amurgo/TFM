Representation:

For the appellant:      Ms Pledger, Latitude Law solicitors
For the respondent:     Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI2008/269) an Anonymity Order is made. Unless the Upper Tribunal or  Court
orders otherwise, no report of any proceedings or any  form  of  publication
thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the original  Appellant.  This
prohibition applies to, amongst others, all parties.

   1. I have anonymised the appellant's name because she is  a  minor.   She
      was born in 2003 and is now 14.

   2. The appellant is a citizen of Uganda.   She  has  appealed  against  a
      decision dated  4  March  2015  refusing  her  application  for  entry
      clearance to join her aunt in the United Kingdom ('UK').  The SSHD did
      not accept that there are  serious  and  compelling  family  or  other
      considerations which would make the appellant's exclusion from the  UK
      undesirable as required  under  para  297(i)(f)   of  the  Immigration
      Rules.  The SSHD also did not accept that the sponsor would be able to
      maintain the appellant without recourse to  public  funds  under  para
      297(v).


   3. The appellant was 12 (but nearly 13) at the  date  of  decision.   The
      appellant's aunt ('the sponsor') is the appellant's late mother's half-
      sister.

Procedural history

   4. After hearing from the sponsor at a hearing, the  First-tier  Tribunal
      dismissed the appellant's appeal in a decision dated 12  August  2016.
      The First-tier Tribunal considered the appellant's case in detail  but
      concluded that the requirements of  297(i)(f)  are  not  met  and  the
      decision does not breach Article 8.


   5. In a decision dated  20  February  2017  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Bruce
      granted permission to appeal.  The  matter  now  comes  before  me  to
      determine whether the First-tier Tribunal decision contains  an  error
      of law


Error of law hearing

   6. Mr Harrison conceded that the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  law  in
      failing to take into account a material significant  factor  -  as  an
      orphan the appellant lived in Uganda without  any  parental  influence
      and that on the evidence the only person capable of being her de facto
      parent and meeting her emotional needs in a  parental  sense,  is  the
      sponsor.


   7. Mr Harrison was entirely correct to make the concession he  did.   The
      First-tier Tribunal undoubtedly set out the appellant's case  in  some
      detail at [11-30].  The findings of fact from [40]  onwards  similarly
      cover much detail.  Specific findings have  been  made  regarding  the
      death certificates provided [45-45] and the presence of  other  family
      members in Uganda [51].  The First-tier Tribunal then accepts that the
      sponsor is the appellant's aunt [52] and is an orphan [53].  The First-
      tier Tribunal then summarises  the  evidence  regarding  Ms  Namanda's
      support  to  the  appellant  from  July  2014  to  July  2015  and  Ms
      Namugerwa's support for the appellant from July 2015 to  the  date  of
      hearing, August 2016 at [54 and 55].   The  First-tier  Tribunal  then
      turns to evidence relating to the  appellant's  schooling  at  [57-61]
      before considering the contact between the appellant and  the  sponsor
      at [62-64].  The First-tier Tribunal then appears to address  some  of
      the factors set out in Mundeba (s.55 and para  297(i)(f)  [2013]  UKUT
      00088 (IAC) at [65 to 74] before concluding at [75] that the  relevant
      test is not met.


   8. This summary of the First-tier Tribunal decision demonstrates that  at
      no point does the First-tier Tribunal make a clear  finding  regarding
      the credibility of the evidence  provided  by  the  appellant  in  the
      papers or the sponsor at the hearing.  This evidence is discussed  and
      analysed but it is unclear whether parts have been  accepted  or  not.
      This evidence is pivotal to the appeal because it sets out  the  claim
      that the sponsor is the only person who has provided emotional support
      in a parental way to the appellant since the death of her  grandfather
      in 2014.  I acknowledge that the First-tier Tribunal  reminded  itself
      of the importance of the appellant's emotional needs at [74] but there
      is a failure to acknowledge what these are and how or if they are  met
      at the date of decision.  That failure is a material error  of  law  -
      the First-tier Tribunal has failed to take into account a  significant
      consideration  when  determining  whether  there   are   serious   and
      compelling family  or  other  considerations  making  the  appellant's
      exclusion undesirable.


   9. That failure is compounded by a further error of law: the  failure  on
      the part of the First-tier Tribunal to consider the best interests and
      welfare of the appellant when assessing her emotional needs or at  all
      - see Mundeba at [36] and [37].

  10. Both representatives agreed that  these  errors  of  law  vitiate  the
      conclusion of the First-tier Tribunal such that its decision should be
      set aside and remade by the Upper Tribunal.   The factual position  is
      uncomplicated and I therefore  concluded  that  I  should  remake  the
      decision myself.


Remaking the decision

Hearing


  11. The representatives were able to agree the following  which  helpfully
      narrows the issues for me to determine.


   i) Given the date of the decision, the appellant is entitled to bring  an
      appeal under the Immigration Rules and Article 8.


  ii) The only issue in dispute  under  the  Immigration  Rules  relates  to
      297(i)(f).  It is accepted that the appellant is an  orphan  and  that
      the sponsor is her only living relative who has ever cared for her  or
      indicated a willingness to care for her.  Mr Harrison accepted that as
      at date of decision and continuing the sponsor has  sufficient  income
      to cover the costs of the appellant in  the  UK  without  recourse  to
      public funds, and that the appellant would be adequately  accommodated
      in the sponsor's three-bedroom home.


 iii) The assessment of 297(i)(f) must assess the position as at the date of
      decision in March 2015.  The appropriate  test  is  that  set  out  in
      Mundeba (supra).


  iv) Given the lack of clarity in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  credibility
      findings, I should hear from the sponsor and make my  own  credibility
      findings.


   v) Only if I find that 297(i)(f) is not met, will it be necessary to turn
      to Article 8.


  12. The sponsor confirmed her witness statements and  gave  oral  evidence
      before me.  She  clarified  several  issues  in  examination-in-chief.
      She made it clear that she could support the appellant in the UK.  She
      continued to work at Trafford Council (and was now in  receipt  of  an
      annual income of ï¿½24900). She continues to  live  in  a  three-bedroom
      house she shares with son. He works at Tesco and attends college  with
      ambitions to go to University.  She described the appellant  as  being
      very lonely for a long period of time and missing her grandfather.


  13. Mr Harrison briefly cross-examined the sponsor.  After the  completion
      of cross-examination, Mr Harrison indicated that he  did  not  dispute
      any of her evidence and invited me to determine the appeal on all  the
      evidence available.  He placed no reliance upon  the  SSHD's  decision
      letter.  As Mr Harrison put it, the appellant has  been  through  very
      traumatic events at a young age and her circumstances are exceptional.


  14. I indicated to Ms Pledger that I did not need to hear from her because
      I was going to allow the appeal, for reasons I now give in writing.

Legal framework

      15. The only issue that arises under the provisions in  paragraph  297
          of the Immigration  Rules  in  this  case  is  whether  there  are
          serious and compelling reasons  family  or  other  considerations,
          which make exclusion of the appellant form the UK undesirable.

      16. The starting point is that there is a high hurdle to  overcome  in
          order to establish that that  there  are  serious  and  compelling
          family or other considerations. In Mundeba it was held that:

                 "34. In our view, 'serious' means that there  needs  to  be
                 more than the parties simply desiring a state of affairs to
                 obtain. 'Compelling' in the context of paragraph  297(i)(f)
                 indicates  that  considerations  that  are  persuasive  and
                 powerful.  'Serious'  read   with   'compelling'   together
                 indicate that the family or other considerations render the
                 exclusion of the child from the United Kingdom undesirable.
                 The  analysis  is  one  of  degree  and   kind.   Such   an
                 interpretation sets a high threshold  that  excludes  cases
                 where, without more, it is simply the wish of parties to be
                 together however natural that ambition that may be.

                 ...

                 36. The exercise of the duty by the Entry Clearance Officer
                 to assess the application under the Immigration Rules as to
                 whether there are family or other considerations making the
                 child's  exclusion  undesirable  inevitably   involves   an
                 assessment of what the child's welfare and  best  interests
                 require. Where an immigration decision  engages  Article  8
                 rights, due regard must be had to the UN Convention on  the
                 Rights of the Child. An entry clearance  decision  for  the
                 admission of a child under  18  is  "an  action  concerning
                 children...undertaken by...administrative authorities"  and
                 so by Article 3 "the best interests of the child shall be a
                 primary consideration". Although the statutory  duty  under
                 s.55 UK Borders Act 2009 only applies  to  children  within
                 the  UK,  the  broader  duty  doubtless  explains  why  the
                 Secretary of State's IDI invites Entry  Clearance  Officers
                 to consider the statutory guidance issued under s.55.

                 37. Family considerations  require  an  evaluation  of  the
                 child's   welfare   including   emotional   needs.   'Other
                 considerations'  come  into  play  where  there  are  other
                 aspects of a child's life that are serious and compelling -
                 for example where an applicant is living in an unacceptable
                 social and economic environment. The focus needs to  be  on
                 the circumstances of the child in the light of his  or  her
                 age, social background and developmental history  and  will
                 involve inquiry as to whether: -

                 (i) there is evidence of neglect or abuse;

                 (ii) there are unmet needs that should be catered for;

                 (iii)  there  are  stable  arrangements  for  the   child's
                 physical care.

                 The assessment involves consideration  as  to  whether  the
                 combination  of  circumstances  sufficiently  serious   and
                 compelling to require admission."

Findings of fact

  17. I entirely accept the credibility of  the  evidence  provided  by  the
      sponsor, which is no longer disputed.  She  gave  her  evidence  in  a
      straightforward and candid manner.  Her evidence has  been  consistent
      in all material respects.  She  has  endeavoured  to  obtain  as  much
      documentary evidence as possible in difficult circumstances  including
      'after the event' death certificates, letters from school and from  Ms
      Namanda and Ms Namugerwa.  Having considered all the evidence from the
      sponsor and the appellant in the round, together with the  documentary
      evidence I make the following findings.


   i) The appellant was aged 12 at the date of the decision and is the niece
      of the sponsor.  The appellant lived with her mother, grandfather, the
      sponsor and other relatives as part of the  same  household  from  the
      time she was a 6-month-old baby.  Her father died when she was a  baby
      and her mother died when she was 2 from AIDS.   The  sponsor  came  to
      live in the UK when the appellant was 4  to  join  her  partner.   The
      appellant continued living in this  household  with  her  grandfather,
      albeit she went to boarding school when she was 8 and returned  during
      the holidays.  The appellant's grandfather was  her  de  facto  parent
      until his death in June 2014.


  ii) Upon the grandfather becoming ill and prior to his death, the  sponsor
      began to pay for the appellant's school fees, and this arrangement has
      continued since then.  Upon his death, the sponsor was the only living
      relative who took any active interest  in  the  appellant.   This  has
      continued since that time.  It was the sponsor who told the  appellant
      about the grandfather's death and it was the sponsor who comforted her
      at the funeral.  It was a very difficult time for  the  appellant  who
      looked upon her grandfather as a parent.  The appellant  continues  to
      find it difficult to cope without any family members supportive of her
      in Uganda.


 iii) The sponsor made arrangements for a friend of  hers,  Ms  Namanda,  to
      lodge the appellant during  the  school  holidays.   This  arrangement
      continued from July 2014 to July 2015.  After this time  and  to  date
      the appellant has stayed with Ms Namanda's  neighbour,  Ms  Namugerwa,
      during the school holidays.  She is paid to provide board and  lodging
      during the school holidays by the sponsor.


  iv) Notwithstanding the living arrangements during the holidays, since the
      grandfather's death and as at the date of decision and continuing, the
      sponsor has  played  an  active  role  in  attempting  to  parent  the
      appellant on a long-distance basis.   The  sponsor  has  overseen  the
      appellant's education, accommodation and emotional needs.  She has met
      her teachers and visited  Uganda,  during  which  time  the  appellant
      stayed with her. The appellant and the sponsor view their relationship
      as a very close one and akin to parent and child.


   v) As at the date of decision and continuing, no other family  member  or
      individual has been able or willing to play a quasi-parental role.  As
      at the date of decision Ms Namanda was due to leave Uganda, which  she
      did in July 2015, when Ms Namugerwa accommodated the appellant.   They
      were paid for these services.


  vi) As at the date of decision the appellant  was  progressing  reasonably
      well in her education and this continues.


 vii) As at the date of decision the  appellant  lived  at  boarding  school
      during term time, and during the holidays lived at Ms Namanda's  home.
      She was due to leave Uganda at the date of decision and did so in July
      2015.  Since this time, during the holidays the appellant  has  lodged
      with Ms Namugerwa in a one bedroom home on a mattress on the floor.


viii) It is firmly in the appellant's best interests  to  be  reunited  with
      the only living relative who has taken any interest in caring for her.
       Her age, family history and circumstances are such that her emotional
      needs unquestionably require a parental authority  in  her  day-to-day
      life.  The absence of this since 2014 when her  grandfather  died  has
      had an adverse impact upon the appellant.

Application of findings of fact to law

      18. I am entirely satisfied that the appellant meets the  high  hurdle
          necessary to establish that that there are serious and  compelling
          family or other considerations, making her exclusion  undesirable.
           This is not a case merely involving a simple desire on  the  part
          of the parties to be together.  The appellant has no other  living
          relative able to offer her the emotional  support  in  a  parental
          capacity that  she  needs.   There  are  persuasive  and  powerful
          factors rendering the circumstances compelling: it is strongly  in
          the appellant's best interests to be reunited with her aunt.   She
          has been through the trauma of having lost both  parents  as  well
          as her grandfather.  She has not had anyone in a de  facto  parent
          role in Uganda since the  death  of  her  grandfather.   This  has
          understandably upset her.

      19. I acknowledge that this is not a case involving neglect or  abuse.
           The appellant's basic needs are being met.   She  has  access  to
          adequate education, board and  accommodation.   Her  circumstances
          in Uganda as at the date of decision were not  however  stable  as
          Ms Namanda was due to leave  Uganda.   Her  residence  during  the
          holiday period was therefore due to  change  in  any  event.   The
          concern in this case is not however directed  at  the  appellant's
          physical care.  Her emotional need to live with and be  cared  for
          in a family home by a person prepared to take on a  parental  role
          can only be met in the  UK  by  her  aunt.   Her  aunt  cannot  be
          expected to return to Uganda.  She has  strong  links  to  the  UK
          through her employment and her son, who lives with her.

      20. The combination of circumstances in  this  case  are  sufficiently
          serious and compelling to require the appellant's  admission,  and
          I therefore find that the requirements of para 297(i)(f) are met.

      21. It follows that there is no need for me to consider Article 8.

Decision

      22. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error  of  law
          and is set aside.


      23. I remake the decision by allowing the appellant's appeal  pursuant
          to the Immigration Rules.
