Representation:
For the claimants:     Mr B Hawkin, instructed by Lambeth Solicitors
For the appellant:     Ms A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Khawar promulgated 27.11.14, allowing  the
    claimants' appeals against the decisions of  the  Secretary  of  State,
    dated 5.3.14, to refuse their applications for leave to remain  on  the
    basis of private and family  life.   The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    23.10.14.

 2. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Foudy  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    24.1.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 18.3.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. The relevant background can be briefly summarised as follows. The first
    claimant (father) came to the UK in 2005 with leave as  a  student.  He
    was joined by the remaining claimants, his wife, the  second  claimant,
    and their children Rebecca  and  Rachel,  third  and  fourth  claimants
    respectively. Rebecca was 4 years of age when she arrived  and  is  now
    13. Rachel was 11 years of age when she arrived and is now 21.

 5. Judge Khawar has very carefully set out the circumstances  of  each  of
    the  claimants  and  summarised  the  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. He allowed the appeals of  father,  mother  and  the  younger
    child Rebecca under the Immigration Rules and allowed the appeal of the
    elder child Rachel under article 8 ECHR.

 6. However, for the reasons set out herein I find that there was an  error
    of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  such
    that the determination of Judge Khawar  should  be  set  aside.  In  an
    otherwise careful and comprehensive decision Judge Khawar made a number
    of errors which vitiate other findings and conclusions in the decision.



 7. From the outset, it is obvious that at least in relation to the parents
    and the younger child Rebecca, that if  one  of  them  is  entitled  to
    remain in the UK then the other two would  be  entitled  to  remain  as
    there could be no question  of  separating  parents  from  the  younger
    child. Different considerations may apply to the older child Rachel.

 8. Whilst the judge may have been correct  to  suggest  at  �23  that  the
    principle issue is the question of whether it is reasonable  to  expect
    the younger child Rebecca to return to Mauritius, the way in which  the
    judge approached that issue is flawed. Before the judge  could  make  a
    viable assessment of Rebecca's rights, the judge should have considered
    those of the parents independent of the children. As the  judge  quoted
    from Azimi-Moyad at �14, if both parents are being removed from the  UK
    then the starting point suggests that so should dependent children  who
    form part of their household unless there are reasons to the contrary.

 9. At �37 the judge found that the parents meet  the  parent  route  under
    Appendix FM. That is an error of law. As both  parents  live  with  the
    children, and thus neither has sole responsibility  for  the  children,
    and neither child is British or settled in the UK, they cannot meet the
    requirements of E-LTRPT2.3. There was no basis  under  Appendix  FM  on
    which the parents could meet the requirements of the  Rules  either  as
    parent or partner.

10. The refusal decision makes some strange assertions about  the  parental
    route, which Ms Holmes could not explain, but  the  judge  should  have
    assessed whether the parents had a right to remain under Appendix FM in
    respect of family life, or under 276ADE in respect of private life.  It
    may have been obvious, as Mr Hawkin suggested to me, that  the  parents
    could not meet the Rules, at  least  Appendix  FM,  but  that  argument
    founders when the judge found that they did. If it  had  been  conceded
    that the parents did not meet  the  requirements  of  the  Rules,  then
    surely  the  judge  would  have  recorded  that.  There  is  no  276ADE
    assessment as to whether either or both parents  met  the  requirements
    for leave to remain whether, given they have not lived in the UK for 20
    years, there are very significant obstacles to their  integration  into
    Mauritius after the period of time they  have  lived  in  the  UK.  The
    refusal decision correctly applied the no ties test, but as the  appeal
    was heard after the revision of 276ADE coming into  force  on  28.7.14,
    the judge should  have  considered  276ADE  and  the  very  significant
    obstacles test.  There  was  no  276ADE  assessment  for  the  parents.
    Finally,  in  respect  of  the  parents,  if  they  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules one would have expected the judge  should  to
    go on to consider their article 8 rights outside the Rules, taking into
    account 117B(6). That was  not  done.  Although  the  judge  considered
    117B(6) at �38, he did so in isolation, stating that it "reiterates the
    legal position under Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE," which makes  no
    sense.

11. It was relevant and  important  to  have  reached  a  view  as  to  the
    entitlement of the parents before  considering  the  situation  of  the
    younger child. The question whether it was reasonable to expect Rebecca
    to return to Mauritius had to be considered in the light of at least  a
    provisional conclusion as to the rights of the parents, as, whilst  not
    determinative, it informs the answer to the question of  reasonableness
    of return in relation to the child. Although the  judge  set  out  some
    very  cogent  reasons  why  he  considered   that   Rebecca   met   the
    reasonableness requirements of 276ADE(iv), having been in the UK some 9
    years since the age of 4, that assessment  was  flawed  without  having
    decided whether it was reasonable for the parents to return, subject to
    the rights of either of  their  children.  In  the  circumstances,  the
    assessment for Rebecca was flawed.

12. There are also errors of law in  the  assessment  of  the  adult  child
    Rachel, addressed from �41 onwards. It is not clear why the  judge  did
    not make  an  assessment  of  her  circumstances  in  relation  to  the
    applicability of paragraph 276ADE. Although she was not a child and had
    not lived in the UK for 20 years, an assessment should have  been  made
    as to whether there were very significant obstacles to her  return  and
    integrating into Mauritius. Such an assessment may  have  obviated  the
    need to consider article 8 outside the Rules at all. However, the judge
    launched  straight  into  an   article   8   assessment   without   any
    consideration of 276ADE, and appears to have approached the  article  8
    assessment on the assumption that what had to  be  considered  was  the
    justification  of  separating  Rachel  from  the  parents  and  younger
    sibling, rather than an assessment in the first place of her individual
    private and family life rights to remain in  the  UK,  before  bringing
    into account whether the parents and/or Rebecca were to be removed  and
    then the effect of that on Rachel's rights to family  life.  For  these
    reasons I also find that the decision in relation to Rachel  is  flawed
    and cannot stand.

13. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    Mr Hawkin submitted that I sould preserve the findings of fact  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, set out carefully as they are. However, the errors
    of the First-tier Tribunal Judge vitiates all other  findings  of  fact
    and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been a valid
    determination of the issues in the appeal. However, that would make the
    task of the First-tier Tribunal Judge rather more difficult. The effect
    of the error has been to deprive the parties of a fair hearing and that
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding  which  is  necessary
    for the decision in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

14. In all the circumstances I remit the appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal
    on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within the Senior
    President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2.

Conclusions:

15. For the reasons set out herein I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the decision in the appeals  to  the  First-tier
                    Tribunal to be made afresh.

Consequential Directions

16. The appeal is remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  at  Hatton  Cross
    (Richmond);

17. It is to be listed for hearing on 21.8.15, with a time  estimate  of  4
    hours;

18. No findings of fact are preserved;

19. No later than 14 days  before  the  appeal  hearing  date  any  further
    evidence to be relied on must be lodged with the Tribunal and served on
    the  other  party  so  as  to  form  a  single  paginated  and  indexed
    consolidated bundle for the tribunal.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to  rule
45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I continue anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
