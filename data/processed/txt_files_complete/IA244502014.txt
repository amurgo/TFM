Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Johnstone,  Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Adejumobi, Immigration Advice Service, Liverpool


                             DECISION AND REASON

   1. The Respondent is a national of Nigeria,  date  of  birth  10th  April
      1983.  On the 19th  September  2014  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
      Crawford) allowed his appeal against the refusal to grant him leave to
      remain in the UK on human rights grounds, and to remove  him  pursuant
      to s47 of  the  Immigration  Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006.  The
      Secretary of State  now  has  permission[1]  to  appeal  against  that
      decision.

   2. The matter in issue before the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  whether  Mr
      Power should be given leave to remain in the UK on the strength of his
      family ties to his British partner, their child and his step-daughter.
       Mr Power relied on Appendix FM and Article 8. The Secretary of  State
      had refused to grant  him  leave  to  remain  on  either  basis.   The
      decision-maker had apparently made a request for  further  information
      from Mr Power's solicitors who had  not  responded  in  time;  he  was
      therefore refused under  the  "suitability"  criterion  in  S-LTR.1.7,
      "failure to comply with a requirement to provide information". Nor was
      the Secretary of State satisfied that Mr Power met the  definition  of
      "Partner", or "Parent" under Appendix FM. In respect of Article 8  the
      Secretary of State did not consider the case to reveal any exceptional
      or compelling circumstances.

   3. On appeal the First-tier Tribunal found that that Mr Power  could  not
      meet the requirements of Appendix FM.  Turning  to  Article  8,  Judge
      Crawford noted his findings that this was a  genuine,  subsisting  and
      durable relationship and that Mr Power and his partner did  intend  to
      marry. He found that Mr Power had a genuine parental relationship with
      his daughter and step-daughter.  Both children  were  British  and  it
      would not be reasonable to expect them to go and live in Nigeria.  The
      girls had all their extended family and friends in the Wallasey area -
      it would be contrary to their best interests to expect them to go  and
      live in Nigeria. Finally the determination addresses the  question  of
      whether it would be reasonable to expect Mr Power to return to Nigeria
      and make an application for entry clearance as a fianc�. Having regard
      to the length of time that this  would  take,  and  the  authority  of
      Chikwamba,  the Tribunal did not find this to be a reasonable  option.
      The appeal was allowed on Article 8 grounds.

   4. The Secretary of State contends that the decision must  be  set  aside
      for the following reasons:

       i) The Tribunal failed to identify whether there were  arguably  good
          grounds for granting leave to remain outside of the  Rules  before
          embarking on the Article 8 assessment: R (on the  application  of)
          Nagre v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin);

      ii)  The  Judge  has  misdirected  himself  in  finding  there  to  be
          compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised by the Rules.
          Mr Power could go to Pakistan (sic - this should  of  course  read
          Nigeria) and apply for entry clearance, or the family could go and
          live with him there;

     iii) He could never have had any legitimate expectation that  he  would
          be permitted to stay.

   5. In her oral submissions Ms Johnstone supplemented  the  grounds,  with
      permission,  by  adding  that  the  Tribunal  had  given  insufficient
      attention to the mandatory considerations in s117B of the Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended  by  the  Immigration  Act
      2014) .

   6. Mr Adejumobi defended the decision. The  fact  that  Mr  Power  had  a
      genuine parental relationship with two British children  whom  he  was
      helping to bring up was in  itself  a  compelling  circumstance.   The
      Judge had found that it would not be reasonable for  either  child  to
      leave and for that reason s117B(6) applied.

      My Findings

   7. This determination is not as clear as it  could  be.  It  is  not  for
      instance obvious on the face of it why the appeal was dismissed  under
      the Rules - as a fianc� Mr Power did qualify as a "partner" by  virtue
      of GEN.1.2 (iii).  The fact that he had not lived with his partner for
      more than two years was therefore irrelevant.  It  would  appear  from
      the Judge's own findings  that  EX.1(a)(i)(cc)  applied,  these  being
      British  children  with  whom  Mr  Power  had   a   genuine   parental
      relationship, and (ii) it not being reasonable that they leave the UK.
        Neither of those findings are challenged in the grounds of appeal or
      by Ms Johnstone in her submissions, in which she expressly  relied  on
      the Secretary of State's concession in Sanade.  That being  the  case,
      the only ground for refusal under  the  Rules  was  the  'suitability'
      requirement raised  in  the  refusal  letter.   That  is  not  clearly
      articulated in the determination.

   8. It is the Article 8 assessment which is however the  subject  of  this
      challenge.

   9. The grounds refer to Nagre and  complain  that  the  Judge  failed  to
      identify an "arguably good case" before addressing  Article  8.   Even
      before Aikins J made the comments he did in MM [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985,
      fortified by the decision in Singh and Khalid [2015] EWCA Civ 74, this
      was a fallacious argument. If the Tribunal,  having  made  a  complete
      assessment  of  proportionality,  found  there  to   be   sufficiently
      compelling reasons to allow the appeal, it follows that it  considered
      there to be an "arguably good case" to do so.

  10. The second ground of appeal - in truth an elaboration of the  first  -
      is that the facts of this case are  not  sufficiently  different  from
      situations covered by  the  Rules  to  warrant  Article  8  protection
      outside of that scheme. Ms Johnstone  submitted  that  the  Rules  are
      there to cover the situation where an individual  has  a  partner  and
      children in the UK.  She is quite  right  about  that  but  since  the
      Secretary of State has not challenged the finding that a) Mr Power  is
      the father/step-father of British children and  b)  it  would  not  be
      reasonable for them to leave the UK it is difficult to see where  this
      argument can lead. The fact is that as in-country applicant  Mr  Power
      met the substantive requirements because he is a  'Partner'  and  EX.1
      applies. The failure to meet the Rules was not his, it was that of his
      representatives. The question was therefore whether it would, in those
      circumstances, be "unjustifiably harsh" to:

           a) Split this family up and deprive these  British  children  of
              their father;

           b) Expect the family to all relocate to Nigeria; or

           c) Expect Mr Power to go alone to Nigeria where he could make an
              application for entry clearance as a fianc�.

  11. Ms Johnstone did not pursue (a).  Notwithstanding that the  author  of
      the grounds cited (b) as a possibility she sensibly declined  to  make
      that submission, referring me to the decision in Sanade. The Secretary
      of State's case before me concentrated on (c): having failed  to  meet
      the in-country requirements under S-LTR.1.7, Mr Power should  go  back
      to Nigeria and make an application for entry clearance in  the  proper
      way. It is submitted that the Tribunal failed to properly address this
      submission. Whilst the reasoning in paragraph 25 is scant I find  that
      the Judge was entitled to reach the decision that he did. The peculiar
      situation that Mr Power finds himself in is that he  fails  in-country
      because his solicitor did not respond to  an  email  in  time.  If  he
      leaves the country he will lose the benefit of the very provision that
      parliament approved in order to protect  children  like  his  from  an
      unjustifiable interference with their right to family life: EX.1.   As
      Judge Crawford observed, the interference in the family  life  between
      father and children would be of "some length" even  if  he  eventually
      managed to get entry clearance.  That is because if Mr Power goes back
      to Nigeria he will lose his job. As the mother of two  young  children
      his partner is unable to work. She will not be  able  to  satisfy  the
      financial requirements necessary to support an application  for  entry
      clearance as a fianc�.   The successful reunification of  this  family
      would depend on the children growing up, getting a place in full  time
      education and Mr Power's partner getting a job earning  the  requisite
      amount.   On  these  facts  there  is  some  justification  for  Judge
      Crawford's conclusion [at 23]: "in effect, to remove  him  to  Nigeria
      would be to break up a family".

  12. As for 'legitimate expectation' I cannot see that this formed any part
      of the reasoning of the Tribunal. It is  correct  to  say  that  as  a
      migrant with precarious status Mr Power took his (family) life in  his
      own hands when he entered into the the relationship that he did.   His
      daughter cannot be blamed for that, and his "precarious" status cannot
      rationally diminish the weight to be attached to her family  life.  It
      is no doubt in recognition of this that parliament drew, in s117B  (4)
      and (5), a distinction between private and family lives:

          (4) Little weight should be given to-

              (a) a private life, or

              (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

          that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is  in
          the United Kingdom unlawfully.

          (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by
          a person at a time when the person's immigration status is
          precarious.

  13. That leads me to Ms Johnstone's additional ground, that the First-tier
      Tribunal failed to consider each of the mandatory  considerations  set
      out in s117B. She relies on the Upper Tribunal decision in Dube [2015]
      UKUT 90 (IAC).  It is true that the determination does  not  in  terms
      refer to Mr Power's ability to speak English (as a  Tier  4  (General)
      Student Migrant he has recently completed his MSc) but this is not the
      focus of the Secretary of State's complaint. That is that there was no
      regard had to the fact that the family are, at least in part,  reliant
      on his partner's benefits. They cannot therefore be said to be  "self-
      sufficient". In fact that is not the test. The Act mandates  that  the
      public interest requires the migrant to be self-sufficient.  Mr  Power
      has paid foreign student fees for his BSc at  Liverpool  John  Moore's
      University and his recent MSc. He has been financially self-sufficient
      for the entire time that he has  lived  in  the  UK,  and  should  the
      restrictions on the amount of hours he is entitled to work be  lifted,
      no  doubt  that  service  to  the  public  interest  would  extend  to
      supporting his partner and children, thus  removing  them  from  their
      current dependence on the tax-payer.  The determination does expressly
      address the public interest in maintaining immigration control [at 23]
      and in doing so notes  that  this  was  an  appellant  who  has  never
      breached immigration law.   As for sub-section (5) the  focus  of  the
      determination is the relationship with  the  children,  not  with  the
      partner.  It cannot therefore be  said  that  this  determination  has
      failed to address the factors set out in s117B (1)-(5).  The  fact  is
      that this determination contains unchallenged findings that  it  would
      not be reasonable to expect these British children to leave the United
      Kingdom. In those circumstances s117B(6) expressly states  that  there
      is no public interest in removing their father. If there is no  public
      interest in removing him, the  Secretary  of  State  cannot  show  the
      decision to be proportionate.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal
      was therefore rational, lawful and open to it on the  evidence  before
      it.

      Decisions

  14. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an error
      of law and it is upheld.
