Representation:

For the Appellants: Mr S Merali, Representative from Visa Trek
For the Respondent: Mr P Mangion, Senior Home Office Presenting Office


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The Appellants are both citizens of Iran.  Mr Farjadnia  was  born  on
      the 20 February 1942 and his wife was born on the 19 February 1940.

   2. Both applicants made application to the Entry  Clearance  Officer  for
      leave to enter the United Kingdom as adult dependant  relatives  under
      Appendix FM of Statement of  Change  of  Immigration  rules  HC395  as
      amended ("the immigration rules").   The  application  was  considered
      under Paragraph EC-DR 1.1 and refused.  In  refusing  the  application
      the Entry  Clearance  Officer  said,  in  respect  of  Mr  Farjadnia's
      application:

            "You have applied to join your daughter and her husband  in  the
           UK as an adult dependant relative.  You  provide  evidence  that
           you are receiving medical treatment in Iran, however  I  am  not
           satisfied that there are not other relatives,  other  than  your
           daughter, who could provide care for you.  Furthermore,  I  note
           that you son-in-law is a doctor in the UK and that care could be
           provided through  financial  health  from  Sponsor.   I  am  not
           satisfied that you are unable to obtain the  required  level  of
           care in ("name of  country"  [sic]).  I  therefore  refuse  your
           application under Paragraph EC-DR 1.1(d) of Appendix FM  of  the
           Immigration rules."

      That refusal was dated the 21 January 2013.  The  refusal  in  respect
      of the Second named Appellant was in similar form and dated  the  same
      date.

   3. The Appellants both appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  their
      appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Kempton at North Shields
      on the 10 December 2013.  For some reason which is not  apparent,  the
      judge  decided  to  produce  two   separate   but   almost   identical
      determinations,  rather  than  deal   with   both   appeals   in   one
      determination.  Since they are linked appeals I deal with both in this
      determination.

   4. The judge set out the requirements of  the  immigration  rules  noting
      that E-ECDR.2.5 requires that:

       "The applicant  or, if  the  applicant  and  their  partner  are  the
           Sponsor's parents or  grandparents,,  the  applicant's  partner,
           must be unable, even with the practical and  financial  help  of
           the Sponsor, to obtain the required level of care in the country
           where they are living, because:

              a) it is not available and there is no person in that  country
                 who can reasonably provide it; or

              b) it is not affordable."

   5. The judge heard evidence from both the Appellants' daughter and son-in-
      law. who told them that they would wish to look after  the  Appellants
      and provide for their every need.  The judge records at  paragraph  15
      that the Sponsors had not actually ascertained the  cost  of  care  in
      Iran, but, she recorded, it would be necessary for 24-hour care to  be
      provided which would necessitate probably two or three people  working
      8 hours a day.  The judge also records  that  this  arrangement  would
      require three full-time salaries to pay to individuals who  would  not
      be related to the Appellants, but would be paid employees.  The  judge
      points out that this arrangement is likely  to  cost  "a  considerable
      sum", but does not actually give an indication of what sums are likely
      to be involved.  She notes that the  Sponsors  are  working  and  that
      their gross income is said to be �200,000.  She records that  that  is
      misleading, because it does not take  account  of  the  nett  sum  the
      Sponsors earn.  The judge went on to allow the Appellants' appeal both
      under the Immigration rules and on human rights grounds.  There was no
      Article 8 appeal before  her  and,  I  was  told  by  the  Appellants'
      representative, Mr Merali, that he did not address her on Article 8.

   6. For the Respondent, Mr Mangion pointed  out  that  the  rules  require
      specific  evidence.   Under  Paragraph  E-ECDR.2.5.,   in   order   to
      demonstrate that care in the country in which the Appellants  live  is
      not affordable, they have to produce evidence.  There was  no  medical
      evidence form the appellant's own doctors as to the level of care they
      both required and no estimate of the cost of providing 24  hour  care,
      which appears to be what the judge assumed the appellant's would need.
       It appears that  the  judge  thought  that  three  workers  would  be
      necessary to provide care to the  Appellants  in  Iran,  but  did  not
      consider the possibility of care being provided by the  government  or
      some local health agency.  There was no evidence  adduced  as  to  the
      level of care available for the elderly in Iran and  no  consideration
      of the cost of that care.  Similarly the judge failed to make a proper
      assessment of the Sponsors' finances and failed to take  into  account
      that apparently there are savings in excess of �90,000  together  with
      savings of the Sponsor.

   7. Insofar as the human rights appeal is concerned, the  judge  makes  no
      reference at all to the rules, merely a reference in paragraph  14  of
      the determination to their being a clear Article 8 issue  in  relation
      to family life.   The burden of proof was on the Appellants and it was
      for them to provide evidence to demonstrate that the  requirements  of
      the immigration rules were met.  Notwithstanding that  the  Appellants
      cannot meet the requirements of the immigration rules the  judge  went
      on to allow the appeal under Article 8 without  considering  the  fact
      that there are no exceptional circumstances  which  would  permit  the
      appeal to be allowed under Article 8.

   8. On behalf of the appellants, I was asked to consider page 417  of  the
      bundle of documentation.  I expressed surprise  that  the  Appellants'
      bundle consisted  of  over  400  pages.   Mr  Merali  referred  me  to
      Paragraph 2.3.3. of the Immigration Directorate Instructions, after  I
      had asked him what evidence had been  placed  before  the  First  Tier
      Tribunal Judge to show the availability of health  care  in  Iran.  He
      said that it was accepted that healthcare is available in Iran, but no
      evidence of that healthcare had been provided,  because  the  personal
      costs of providing full-time care to the Appellants was too expensive.
       Evidence of the availability of private of state healthcare  for  the
      elderly in Iran had not provided because, he suggested,  the  guidance
      issued by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate did not call for
      any such evidence.  He accepted that there was no human rights  appeal
      before the judge and told me that he had not made  any  submission  in
      respect of Article 8.  While the judge had not  considered  Article  8
      under the Immigration rules, it  was,  he  urged,  implicit  from  the
      determination  that  the  judge  had  considered   that   there   were
      exceptional  compassionate  circumstances  which   justified   looking
      outside  the  rules  to  decide  whether  or  not  the  decision   was
      proportionate.

   9.  Responding  briefly,  Mr  Mangion  pointed  out  that  even  if   the
      Appellants' representative was correct and valid, and evidence of  the
      availability and cost of private and, or  in  the  alternative,  state
      healthcare for the elderly in Iran was not necessary in order to prove
      entitlement under the immigration rules, it is clear that the  Sponsor
      was not in a position to have adequately investigated the cost of  the
      provision of healthcare in Iran.   The  Appellants'  son-in-law  is  a
      general medical practitioner in  the  United  Kingdom,  but  does  not
      practice in Iran.  However, even at paragraph 15 of the determination,
      the judge herself points out that the issue  of  costs  has  not  been
      explored.

  10. Mr Mangion suggested that the appropriate course, were an error of law
      to be found, would be for the appeal to be remitted to the  First-tier
      Tribunal for hearing afresh before an  Immigration  Judge  other  than
      Immigration Judge Kempton.  Mr Merali agreed.  I reserved my decision.

  11. The requirements of Paragraph EC-DR.1.1 include a requirement that  an
      applicant must meet all the requirements of Section E-ECDR.  Section E-
      ECDR 2.2 was set out by the Immigration Judge in the determination.

  12. It is the Appellants' case that because  the  Immigration  Directorate
      Instructions do not ask for any evidence to be provided the show  that
      an applicant meets the  requirements  of  the  immigration  rules,  no
      evidence is necessary.  I respectfully disagree.  Paragraph  2.3.3  of
      the Immigration Directorate Instructions says this:

       "2.3.3.    Evidence that the  applicant  is  unable,  even  with  the
                 practical and financial help of the Sponsor in  the  United
                 Kingdom, to obtain  the  required  level  of  care  in  the
                 country where they are living: Evidence that  the  required
                 level of care:

                    a) is not, or is no  longer  available  in  the  country
                       where the applicant is living.  This  evidence  could
                       be  in  the  form  of  a  central  or  local   health
                       authority, a local authority, or a  doctor  or  other
                       health professional.  If the required care  has  been
                       provided through a private arrangement, the applicant
                       must provide details of that arrangement and  why  it
                       is no longer available.

                    b) if it is not or  is  no  longer,  affordable  in  the
                       country where the appellant lives.   If  payment  was
                       made for arranging this care, the ECO should  ask  to
                       see records and an explanation of  why  this  payment
                       cannot  continue.   If  financial  support  has  been
                       provided by the Sponsor or other close family in  the
                       UK, the ECO should ask to see an explanation  of  why
                       this cannot continue or is no  longer  sufficient  to
                       enable the required level of care to be provided."

  13. Immigration Directorate Instructions  are  instructions  addressed  to
      Immigration Officers, nothing more.  They do not  bind  judges.   They
      may, on occasions serve to better inform a judge about an  immigration
      rule, but what the judge  is  required  to  have  regard  to,  is  the
      relevant immigration rule under which the application is made.

  14. E-ECDR.2.5 requires that it has to be demonstrated that, even with the
      practical and financial help of the Sponsor or Sponsor's partner,  the
      Appellants are unable to obtain the required  level  of  care  in  the
      country where they are living because either it is not available or it
      is not affordable.  There was  no  consideration  by  the  First  Tier
      Tribunal Judge, based on medical evidence  from  the  appellants'  own
      doctors and consideration of  other  evidence  submitted,  as  to  the
      required level of care  these  appellants  need.   This  part  of  the
      assessment of whether or not the requirements of the  rules  were  met
      was simply not carried out.

  15. It was merely assumed by the judge, because it had  been  asserted  on
      their behalf, that the Appellants would require 24  hour  care,  which
      would necessitate the employment of two  or  three  people  working  8
      hours a  day  to  provide  24  hour  cover.   This  also  ignores  the
      possibility that the state or some private organisation  in  Iran  may
      provide care facilities which would be  suitable  for  the  Appellants
      once their required level of care had been established by  the  judge.
      Individual care provided by three or more individuals who have  to  be
      individually contracted by the Appellants to look after them in  their
      own home, may very well be unaffordable, but  there  appears  to  have
      been no independent evidence before the judge to suggest the level  of
      care which the Appellants require, is not otherwise available  from  a
      Government agency such as the equivalent of a local authority in  Iran
      or from a private organisation.

  16. I  appreciate  that  the  First  named  Appellant  has  recently  been
      diagnosed with cancer, but there does not appear to have been  carried
      out any form of assessment of the Appellants'  care  needs  by  health
      professionals in Iran.  I should point that I have read  and  examined
      their  application  in  which  details  of   their   arthritis,   disc
      herniation; spondylodiskitis; sciatalblia and chronic neck  and  right
      shoulder pain are detailed and I note  that  both  require  assistance
      with washing, dressing and preparing food.  With respect this does not
      mean that they are in need, necessarily, of 24-hour care.

  17. The judge points out in paragraph 15 of  her  determination  that  the
      cost of care in Iran had not been explored by  the  Sponsors,  because
      they believed that 24-hour care would be necessary.  The judge did not
      look at their finances  and  ability  to  assist  the  Appellants  and
      obtained no detailed evidence as to the likely costs.

  18. The judge has  further  erred  by  failing  to  consider  whether  the
      Appellants might qualify on Article 8 grounds  under  the  Immigration
      rules and, if they do  not,  going  on  to  apply  Nagre,  R  (on  the
      application of) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2013]
      EWHC 720 (Admin) Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules  -  correct  approach)
      [2013] UKUT  00640  (IAC)  and  Kabia  (MF:  para  398  -  exceptional
      circumstances) (Gambia) [2013] UKUT 569 (IAC)  .  I  believe  that  in
      allowing the appeal under Article 8 the judge has materially erred  in
      law.

  19. The making of the decision by the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error of law.  I set aside the decision.

  20. I believe that very careful findings are necessary before  it  can  be
      established whether or not the Appellants meet the requirements of the
      Immigration rules.  I  believe  that  this  is  a  case  where  it  is
      appropriate for me under, the Senior President's  Practice  Statement,
      to remit this appeal for re-hearing before a First-tier Tribunal Judge
      other than Judge Kempton.

       Three hours should be allowed for the hearing.
