For the Appellant: Ms Cooke instructed by Milestone Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr C Avery Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
        Kaler promulgated on the 23 May 2016 following a hearing at  Hendon
        Magistrates Court on the 16 May 2016.
     2. The appeals have been linked as they involve  a  common  theme.  Mr
        Baig, a national of Pakistan born on the 5  December  1983  and  Mr
        Adnan, also a national of Pakistan but who was born on  the  3  May
        1987, claim to be at risk on return to Pakistan as  gay  men.  They
        claim to be in a relationship with each other in the UK.
     3. Judge Kaler set out the assessment of the merits of the  case  from
        paragraph 19 of the determination. The Judge did not find the claim
        to have been proved by either appellant.
     4. Permission to appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
        Robertson on the 15 June 2016.
     5. Although a number  of  the  challenges  to  the  determination  are
        without arguable merit there is one key challenge  which  leads  to
        the decision we have made below.
     6. At paragraph 30 of the decision Judge Kaler finds:


         30. I consider the Appellant's immigration history.  It is clear to
         me that both of them wished to continue  living  in  the  UK  after
         expiry of their leave. Baig tried to remain  by  making  a  Tier  1
         application but it seems to have been a hopeless application and he
         did nothing after it was refused.  At that time, he did not realise
         he was gay and so he had no further reason to remain in the UK.  He
         did not leave and that indicates to me that it is not his  wish  to
         return to live in Pakistan, and it was not his wish to do  so  even
         before he realised he was gay.


     7. The issue in the case for both appellants was that of  credibility.
        The Judge was clearly of the opinion that Mr Baig had attempted  to
        remain in the UK for other reasons, only making the asylum claim on
        14 June 2015 as he realised by then that he is gay. What the  Judge
        fails to do is to adequately reason this finding  by  reference  to
        all the available evidence which  includes  Mr  Baig's  replies  to
        questions put to him at interview, at questions 40-45,  which   are
        as follows:


        |No.|Question               |Reply                                  |
|40 |When did you first     |Here or in PAK                         |
|   |begin to identify      |                                       |
|   |yourself as a          |                                       |
|   |homosexual?            |                                       |
|   |                       |I was 17 or 18 years old               |
|   |The very first time you|                                       |
|   |identified yourself in |                                       |
|   |this way?              |                                       |
|41 |How did you discover   |Because I was studying in a mixed co-ed|
|   |this?                  |school. My friends used to talk to     |
|   |                       |girls but I never had any interest in  |
|   |                       |that.                                  |
|42 |Did this happen        |It was gradual, because I did not have |
|   |gradually or was there |any brothers, I only had sisters and I |
|   |a particular situation |was always with them and their friends.|
|   |that led you to realise|I had friends who used to go and see   |
|   |this?                  |girls.  I also went a few times but I  |
|   |                       |did not have any feeling for them.     |
|43 |What was it in         |Because as I said I had male friends   |
|   |particular about girls |who used to go and see girls.  I also  |
|   |that you were not      |went a few times and tried but I did   |
|   |attracted to?          |not have any such feelings.            |
|44 |My question was what   |I used to have male friends and when I |
|   |was it about girls that|used to touch them, I used to have     |
|   |you were not attracted |feelings within myself for them.  At   |
|   |to?  Was there anything|the same time, when I used to touch    |
|   |in particular?         |girls, I never had any feelings for    |
|   |                       |them.                                  |
|45 |How did it make you    |I was actually scarred thinking that   |
|   |feel when you realised |how am I going to tell anyone about it.|
|   |this?                  |I used to watch some video clips and   |
|   |                       |stuff to reduce my frustrations about  |
|   |                       |it.                                    |


     8. The Judge may have been  entitled  to  reject  this  evidence  when
        considering matters in the round but the lack of any  reference  to
        it and the specific terms of paragraph 30 lead us to conclude  that
        this is not material that was considered by the Judge. The starting
        point in this case is the first question posed by Lord Hope  in  HJ
        (Iran) v SSHD [2010] UKSC 31 which is 'Is the appellant gay?' It is
        an arguable legal error not to consider all  evidence  relevant  to
        this issue without the required  degree  of  anxious  scrutiny,  as
        appears to have been the situation in this appeal.
     9. Ms Cooke also raised a further issue which she submitted showed the
        Judge had made a  factual  error  and  inconsistent  finding  on  a
        material issues. This relates to paragraph 32 of the  determination
        under challenge in which the Judge records:


         32...In his interview he said  he  had  been  threatened  when  his
         father was told by him that he was gay.   However  the  wording  of
         paragraph 19 of his statement suggests that  his  father  does  not
         know about the Appellant's sexuality.  I am not persuaded that  the
         Appellant's father does  know  about  his  claimed  sexuality.  The
         failure to claim asylum for such a long time does have  an  adverse
         impact upon their credibility.


    10. Whilst the comment regarding delay in claiming asylum may have been
        reasonably open to  the  Judge  on  the  facts  there  is  a  clear
        misunderstanding of the evidence. Paragraph 19 of Mr Baig's witness
        statement is his reply to paragraph 20 of the Reasons  for  Refusal
        letter. This is clear from the wording of that paragraph:


         19. In paragraph 20 SSHD states that my answers were indirect  when
         I talked about how I felt when I was  unable  to  speak  to  people
         about my sexuality.   I  submit  that  when  I  realised  I  was  a
         homosexual I was scared and confused.  I knew this is forbidden and
         a sin in Islam.  My father was very strict and  religious  man.   I
         had to be very careful.  I knew if my father ever came to  know  of
         my sexuality he would have killed me with his bare hands.


    11. Question 140 of his interview, that referred to by the Judge, is as
        follows:


        |No.|Question      |Reply                                           |
|140|How did your  |In 2012/13, they were asking me to go back      |
|   |family find   |because they wanted me to get married.  Finally,|
|   |out about your|my partner and I decided to get married and we  |
|   |sexuality?    |told our family members. Since then I haven't   |
|   |              |had contact.  If it didn't tell them, they would|
|   |              |have arranged a marriage for me.                |


    12. Ms Cooke's submission that there is no contradiction as the witness
        statement related to the time before Mr Baig entered the UK,  which
        was in 2008, and the reply to question 140 to 2012/3  has  arguable
        merit, although in isolation this may not have been material.
    13. We cannot be satisfied that Mr Baig has had a fair hearing  of  his
        claim in which a judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  has  considered
        all the available evidence with  the  required  degree  of  anxious
        scrutiny. This is  important,  for  had  this  been  the  case  and
        adequate reasons  given  for  the  findings  that  showed  all  the
        evidence had  been  properly  considered  the  adverse  credibility
        findings may have been reasonably open to the Judge, as the  weight
        given to the evidence would have been a matter for the Judge. As it
        is, and  this  is  an  appeal  in  which  the  credibility  of  the
        appellants' is the key element,  we  find  legal  error  proved  as
        submitted. The appeals of both appellants are linked  in  fact  and
        law and so neither can be maintained.
    14. We find legal error material to the decision to dismiss the appeals
        of both appellants' proved. The determinations shall be set  aside.
        There shall be no preserved findings. As the appellants' have still
        to receive a fair  hearing  at  which  all  available  evidence  is
        considered  with  the  required  degree  of  anxious  scrutiny,  we
        consider there is no option in this case other than to remit to the
        First-tier Tribunal sitting at Hatton Cross for the  matter  to  be
        heard afresh by a  judge  nominated  by  the  Resident  Judge,  but
        excluding Judge Kaler.


Decision

    15. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. We set aside
        the decision of the original Judge. We remit the appeals to the
        First-tier Tribunal sitting at Hatton Cross for rehearing.


   Anonymity.


    16. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules
        2005.


          We make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal
   Procedure           (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
