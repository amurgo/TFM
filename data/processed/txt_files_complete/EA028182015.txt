Solicitors Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the decision  of  the
    Secretary of State to refuse to issue him with  a  permanent  residence
    card as confirmation of him having a retained right of residence  under
    Regulation 10,  and  of  him  having  acquired  a  permanent  right  of
    residence under Regulation 15.  The First-tier Tribunal did not make an
    anonymity direction, and I do not consider that the appellant  requires
    anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Reason for the Grant for Permission to Appeal

 2. On 9  October  2017  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Shimmin  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal for the  following
    reasons:

         It is arguable that the decision is perverse and irrational in that
         the judge failed to consider and make  findings  on  a  substantial
         proportion of the evidence relied on by the appellant.

Relevant Background

 3. The appellant is a national of Pakistan,  whose  date  of  birth  is  9
    September 1986.  On 6 May 2011 he applied for a residence card  as  the
    spouse  of  an  EEA  national  exercising  Treaty  rights  here.    His
    application  was  refused  on  1  September  2011,  but  the  appellant
    successfully appealed against this decision, and he was issued  with  a
    five year residence card on 8 November 2011.  On  14  April  2015,  the
    appellant's marriage to "MC", a Polish national, was terminated by  the
    issue of a decree absolute.  On 22 May 2015, Shan Solicitors applied on
    the appellant's behalf for a residence  card  as  confirmation  of  his
    continuing right to reside in the UK.

 4. On 11 November 2015, the respondent gave her reasons for  refusing  the
    application.  It was noted that the appellant  had  supplied  a  letter
    from Raei & Co Accountants, dated 26 November 2014. They  claimed  that
    they were MC's accountants, and that she had been self-employed since 6
    April 2012.  However, it was considered that the evidence of her  self-
    employment from 6 April 2012 to the date of divorce  was  insufficient.
    The SA302 tax return calculations  for  2012/13  and  2013/14  included
    information which had been captured by HMRC as  the  direct  result  of
    data that was provided to them from  the  self-employed  person.   This
    information was in no way  verified  by  HMRC  as  being  accurate  and
    therefore it could not be considered  on  its  own  as  being  reliable
    evidence of self-employment.  Also, there  was  no  evidence  of  self-
    employment beyond December 2014, and as such the respondent  could  not
    confirm that his former EEA sponsor was exercising Treaty rights at the
    time of the divorce.  It  was  decided  to  refuse  the  issue  of  the
    confirmation that the appellant sought under Regulation 15(1)(f),  with
    reference to Regulation 10(5).

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The appellant's appeal came before Judge  Courtney  sitting  at  Hatton
    Cross on 13 March 2017.  Both parties were legally represented.

 6. As was noted by the Judge at paragraph [16], the evidence  produced  by
    way of appeal included a letter dated 23 April  2015  from  Raei  &  Co
    Accountants.  They confirmed that they had been acting for MC for three
    years, and they gave details of her turnover from  self-employment  for
    each of these years, including a turnover of ï¿½9,142 for  the  tax  year
    2014/15.  The Judge further noted that MC's business accounts  for  the
    three financial  years  had  been  submitted,  together  with  the  tax
    calculations.  She also observed that there was evidence to  show  that
    MC had paid self-employed Class 2 NI contributions in 2013 and 2014.

 7. At paragraph [26] the Judge set out an extract  from  the  Home  Office
    Guidance on "EEA nationals:  Qualified  Persons"  which  addressed  the
    question of what reasonable evidence of self-employment might  include.
    At paragraph [28] the Judge held:

         Guidance as to the quality of evidence necessary to satisfy a  test
         of a particular case  is  a  matter  of  practicality  rather  than
         principle.  I recognise the Regulations themselves do  not  specify
         evidence, and the guidance is  at  most  an  aid  to  construction.
         However, the burden  of  proof  is  on  the  appellant  to  produce
         relevant evidence to substantiate  his  claim.   Mr  Riaz  has  not
         provided any invoices, receipts, contracts, accounts or advertising
         relating to his ex-wife's claimed  self-employment  as  a  cleaner.
         This would show that she was actively trading.  He states that  the
         Sponsor was paid in cash, but negligible cash activity was shown in
         her bank account.  The joint HSBC account reveals very few credits,
         and none that can be ascribed to [MC's] claimed self-employment  as
         a cleaner.  I am not satisfied, on the  balance  of  probabilities,
         the EEA national sponsor was carrying out genuine economic activity
         in the UK as a self-employed person as at the date of the  divorce.
         The appellant has not established that he is a  family  member  who
         has retained right  of  residence  after  the  termination  of  his
         marriage.

Reasons for Finding and Error of Law

 8. The Judge misdirected herself in paragraph [28] in stating that Mr Riaz
    had not provided any accounts relating to his ex-wife's  claimed  self-
    employment as a cleaner.  Not only had he  provided  accounts  for  the
    three completed tax years, but he had also provided letters  from  MC's
    accountants confirming the accuracy of the  information  given  in  the
    accounts which they had prepared.

 9. Mr Kotas sought to defend the decision on the ground that there was  in
    fact no specific  documentary  evidence  relating  to  the  ex-spouse's
    exercise of Treaty rights after 5 April 2015, whereas the date  of  the
    divorce was 17 April 2015.  However, this was not a  distinction  which
    was drawn by the Judge.  Her reasoning  was  entirely  based  upon  the
    proposition that the absence of  "any  invoices,  receipts,  contracts,
    accounts or  advertising"  relating  to  the  ex-wife's  claimed  self-
    employment as a cleaner in the period leading up to the  divorce  meant
    that it had not been shown that she had been actively  trading  at  any
    point; and hence it had not been shown that she was actively trading at
    the point of divorce.

10. The Judge was not bound to find that the evidence emanating  from  MC's
    accountants was sufficient to discharge the burden  of  proof.  But  in
    failing to address such evidence,  the  Judge  did  not  give  adequate
    reasons for finding against the appellant.







The Re-making of the Decision

11. Mr Singer and Mr Kotas were in agreement that it was open to me to  re-
    make the decision on  the  evidence  that  was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Mr Kotas repeated his earlier submission that there  was  no
    documentary evidence to show that the ex-spouse was  exercising  Treaty
    rights at the point of divorce, which was 12 days after the end of  the
    tax year covered by the most recent disclosed accounts.  Mr Kotas  also
    submitted that it might be the case that the ex-spouse had ceased self-
    employment as a cleaner in December 2014.  Without  disclosure  of  the
    underlying information which the accountants had drawn  on  to  prepare
    the accounts for the tax year ending 5 April 2015, it was a  matter  of
    conjecture whether the ex-spouse had carried on working until  the  end
    of the tax year.

12. On behalf of the appellant, Mr  Singer  submitted  that  the  level  of
    turnover disclosed in the 2015 accounts was on a par with the  turnover
    in the preceding two  tax  years,  and  so  it  was  not  a  reasonable
    inference that the ex-spouse had ceased her  economic  activity  before
    the end of the tax year.  He also invited me to place  some  weight  on
    the fact that the latest letter from the accountants was dated 23 April
    2015, which was six days after the decree absolute was issued.  In  the
    letter of 23 April 2015, the accountants confirmed that  the  ex-spouse
    continued to be self-employed as a cleaner.

13. There is  no  suggestion  that  the  ex-spouse's  accountants  are  not
    competent and appropriately qualified professionals.   The  implication
    of the letter of 23 April 2015 is that the ex-spouse has  continued  to
    engage in self-employed activity throughout the most recent  tax  year;
    and that, so far as the accountants are aware, the  ex-spouse  has  not
    ceased such activity. I accept that there is  no  specific  documentary
    evidence covering the period between 5 April 2015 and  17  April  2015.
    However, given the background of three years' continuous  self-employed
    activity as a cleaner, and the fact that MC could no longer rely on the
    appellant's earnings to supplement her income, it is unlikely that  she
    would  have  ceased  self-employment  immediately  before  the   decree
    absolute was issued.

14. For the above reasons, I find that the  appellant  had  discharged  the
    burden of proving on the balance of probabilities that his ex-wife  was
    exercising Treaty rights as a self-employed  person  at  the  point  of
    divorce,  and  hence  he  has  a  retained  right  of  residence  under
    Regulation 10(5).

15. After I had ruled in the appellant's favour under Regulation 10(5),  Mr
    Singer raised the question of whether the appellant also qualified  for
    a permanent residence card under  Regulation  15.   He  submitted  that
    there was no issue as to the  appellant  meeting  the  requirements  of
    Regulation 10(6), and he invited me to find that the appellant had also
    discharged the burden of proving that, as at the date  of  the  hearing
    before me, he had resided in the UK for a  continuous  period  of  five
    years in accordance with the Regulations.  Mr Kotas did not  raise  any
    opposition to  Mr  Singer's  proposal,  and  so  I  also  find  in  the
    appellant's favour on the issue  of  his  entitlement  to  a  permanent
    residence card.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted: the appellant's appeal  is  allowed  under  Regulation  10  and
Regulation 15 of the Regulations 2006.

I make no anonymity direction.

Signed                              Date 16 December 2017

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed this appeal, I have given consideration as to  whether  to
make a fee award in respect of any fee which has been paid  or  is  payable,
and I have decided to make no fee award, as the appellant  needed  to  bring
forward further documentary evidence by way of appeal in  order  to  succeed
in his appeal.
