For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Jamaica born 14th January  1982  who  was
    granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal   against   a
    determination of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Walters,  dismissing
    the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's refusal  to  issue  her
    with a permanent residence card as the spouse of an EEA national.

 2. The appeal was listed before me on 8th December  2014.   The  Appellant
    did not attend but had submitted  a  letter  dated  2nd  December  2014
    indicating that she had been granted leave to remain for a period of 30
    months, and she therefore wished to withdraw her appeal.

 3. Rule 17(2) of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 states
    that a notice of withdrawal will  not  take  effect  unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal consents to the withdrawal.  Mr Nath had no comment to make on
    the withdrawal application.

 4. I agreed to the withdrawal of the appeal, and there is consequently  no
    appeal before the Upper Tribunal.

 5. No anonymity order is made.



Signed        Date 8th December 2014

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge M A Hall
