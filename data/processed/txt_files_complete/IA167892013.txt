                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Iqbal (instructed by Farani. Javid. Taylor,
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr G Saunders (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent  appeals to the Upper Tribunal, with permission, against
    the  determination  of  the   First-tier   Tribunal   (Judge   Higgins)
    promulgated on 6th February 2014 by which it allowed   the  Appellant's
    appeal against the Secretary of State's decision to refuse him leave to
    remain as Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.

 2. Although the Secretary of State  is  the  Appellant  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal, I will continue to refer to her  as  the  Respondent  and  Mr
    Shahzad as the Appellant for the sake of clarity and continuity.

 3. The Appellant had entered the UK on 25th February 2006 as a student and
    that leave was subsequently extended as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
    Migrant  and then as a Tier 1 (Post Study Work) Migrant.

 4. He then made application as a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  on  29th
    August 2012. The Immigration Rules changed at the end of 2012 by virtue
    of HC760.  The changes relevant to this Appellant were said to apply to
    applications made  but  not  yet  decided.   The  changes  altered  the
    required documentation to  be  submitted  with  the  application.   The
    Secretary of State, quite properly wrote to the Appellant pointing  out
    the changes and what was required in addition to what  he  had  already
    submitted.  He sent in various documents and then in a  decision  dated
    26th April 2013 the Secretary of State refused his application.

 5. As pointed out by the First-tier Tribunal Judge in paragraph 7 - 11  of
    his determination the Secretary of State refused  the  application  for
    four reasons. The first was that he  had  not  produced  the  requisite
    documents to show that he was registered as a director of  the  company
    on a date within 3 months prior to the application.

 6. The second was that his occupation as "Business Consultant" was  not  a
    job listed in Appendix J.

 7. The third was that the contracts required to show trading did not  meet
    the Rules and finally that the documents that were produced to show the
    availability of funds did not meet the Rules.

 8. In his determination the Judge said that the document with reference to
    the Appellant's directorship that  the  Secretary  of  State  said  was
    absent was not required by the Rules.  If it was  referred  to  in  the
    Guidance, but that Guidance was not produced. It was not  an  objection
    raised in  the  letter  seeking  additional  information  sent  by  the
    Secretary of State and if it was inadequate it should have been.  There
    was clear evidence that  the  Appellant  was  indeed  registered  as  a
    director at the required time.  That was a finding open  to  the  Judge
    and not in error.

 9. Secondly, the Judge noted that  while  "Business  Consultant"  did  not
    appear in Appendix J, "Management Consultant and Business Analysts" did
    and he found them to be one and the same.  Again that is a finding open
    to him and not an error; it is no more than, for example, finding  that
    a hair stylist and a hairdresser are one and the same or an actress and
    a stage performer.

10. Thirdly, with regard to the Contract,  due  to  the  request  from  the
    Secretary of State, the information was   contained  in  two  documents
    rather  than one but taken together they met  the  requirement  of  the
    Rules. In those circumstances again the Judge was entitled to find  the
    requirements met.

11. The final objection is the one that is most complex.

12. Mr Iqbal took me through the requirements of the Rules as they were  at
    the date of decision.  The Secretary of State objected  to  the  format
    and contents of the third party sponsor's  bank  statement  and  letter
    from the bank, in particular that it contained no confirmation that the
    monies were available to the Applicant. That part of the Refusal reads:-



         You have stated that you have access to funds in excess of �50,000,
         which is being made available to you by third party Mr Nabeel Fazal
         Malik, and you have provided a letter from Barclays Bank  dated  17
         August 2012 in this respect.

         "Paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules states that
         each letter from a financial institution must:

          . Be an original document and not a copy,

          . Be on the institution's official headed paper,

          . Have been issued by an authorised official of that institution,

          . Have been produced within the three  months  immediately  before
            the date of your application,

          . Confirm that the institution is  regulated  by  the  appropriate
            body,

          . State the applicant's name  and  his  team  partner's  name  (if
            applicable),

          . State the date of the document,

          . Confirm the amount of money available from the  applicant's  own
            funds (if applicable) that are held in that institution,

          . Confirm the amount of money provided to the applicant  from  any
            third party (if applicable), that is held in that institution,

          . Confirm the name of each third party and their contact  details,
            including their full address  including  postal  code,  landline
            telephone number and any email address, and

          . Confirm that if the money is not in an institution regulated  by
            the FSA, the money can be transferred into the UK.

         The letter from Barclays does not:

                . State your name

           . Confirm the amount of money available to you  from  your  third
             party that is   held in that institution

           . Confirm the contact details  of  your  third  party,  his  full
             address including postal code, landline phone  number  and  any
             email address"



13.  That part of the decision recites paragraph 41-SD(a)(i).  However  that
    is not the whole paragraph.  Paragraph 41 as a whole reads:-


         "41. An applicant will only be considered to have access to funds
    if:

         (a) The specified documents in paragraph 41-SD are provided to show
         cash money to the amount required (this must not be in the form of
         assets);

         (b) The specified documents in paragraph 41-SD are provided to show
         that the applicant has permission to use the money to invest in a
         business in the UK;

         (c) The money is either held in a UK regulated financial
         institution or is transferable to the UK; and

         (d) The money will remain available to the applicant until such
         time as it is spent in the establishment or running of the
         applicant's business or businesses. 'Spent' excludes spending on
         the applicant's own remuneration. The UK Border Agency reserves the
         right to request further evidence or otherwise verify that the
         money will remain available, and to refuse the application if this
         evidence is not provided or it is unable to satisfactorily verify.
         'Available to him' means that the funds are:

         (1) in his own possession,

         (2) in the financial accounts of a UK incorporated business of
         which he is the director, or

         (3) available from the third party or parties named in the
         application under the terms of the declaration(s) referred to in
         paragraph 41-SD(b) of Appendix A.

         41-SD. The specified documents in Table 4 and paragraph 41 are as
         follows:

         (a) The specified documents to show evidence of the money available
         to invest are one or more of the following specified dics:

                  before the date of your application,

             appropriate body,

                  (6) state the applicant's name, and his team partner's

                  any email address, and

                  (11) Confirm that if the money is not in an institution

                  contract and their contact details, including their full
                  address, postal code  landline phone number and any email
                  address;


13. We are told that the extremely detailed Immigration  Rules  are  to  be
    read literally and with their normal meaning.  That would indicate that
    in accordance with the Rules at the date of decision, in  the  case  of
    third party funding where the funds have not already  been  transferred
    to the applicant the  relevant  documents  to  be  provided  are  those
    referred to in 41-SD(b) and (c) only.  The Appellant did meet those.

14. The Rules I find  are  clear  that  41-SD(a)  applies  only  where  the
    Appellant relies either on money of his own or that  has  already  been
    transferred to him by a third party (paragraph 41-SD(a)  (i)(9)  refers
    to  the  past  tense).  41-SD(a)(ii)  clearly  relates  also   to   the
    Applicants' own money because it refers to a bank statement in his  own
    name (41-SD-(a)(ii)(4).

15. Paragraph 41-SD (b) is thus the section applicable where there is third
    party support and absurd though it may appear, there is no  requirement
    to lodge financial documents in a specified format.  It  is  reasonable
    to expect evidence that the third party actually has the money but  the
    specific details required when it is the  Appellant's  'own  money  are
    absent.  I am fortified in this view by the contents of the application
    form which clearly differentiates between the requirements for  someone
    who is providing their own funds and some-one relying  on  third  party
    support.

16. Thus while the Judge erred in  suggesting  that  the  Rules  should  be
    interpreted purposively, his error was immaterial because the  evidence
    was that the Appellant did meet the requirements of the Rules  as  they
    were at the relevant time.

17. Accordingly the First-tier Tribunal did not make a  material  error  of
    law and the determination shall stand.

18. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
