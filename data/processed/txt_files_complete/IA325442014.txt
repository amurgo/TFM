Representation

For the Appellant: Mr A Adebayo, instructed by A2 Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born  on  31  December  1966  whose
   application for a residence card as the extended family member of an  EEA
   national  was  refused.  She  subsequently  appealed  to  the  First-tier
   Tribunal ("FtT"). Her appeal was heard by FtT Judge  Housego  who,  in  a
   decision promulgated on 10 September 2015, dismissed the appeal.

2. The background to this  appeal  is  that  the  appellant's  sister  ("the
   sponsor") became a German citizen on or shortly before 17 July  2006  and
   moved to the UK in 2007. The appellant, with her mother,  then  travelled
   to the UK, also in 2007.

3. In May 2009 the appellant applied for a residence card.  Her  application
   was refused.

4. On 25 February 2014 the  appellant  made  a  further  application  for  a
   residence card. This application was refused on the basis  that  she  had
   failed to provide evidence of dependency on the sponsor either  prior  to
   or since entering the UK and therefore  did  not  meet  the  requirements
   under Regulation 8(2) of the Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006  ("the
   2006 Regulations") to be classified as an extended family member.


Relevant provisions of the 2006 Regulations

5. The key issue before the FtT, and in this appeal of the  FtT's  decision,
   is whether the appellant  met  the  definition  of  an  "extended  family
   member" by satisfying the conditions  in  Regulation  8(2)  of  the  2006
   Regulations. These provide as follows:

      (a) the person is residing in a country other than the United  Kingdom
      and is dependent  upon  the  EEA  national  or  is  a  member  of  his
      household;


      (b) the person  satisfied  the  condition  in  paragraph  (a)  and  is
      accompanying the EEA national to the United Kingdom or wishes to  join
      him there; or


      (c) the person satisfied the condition in paragraph  (a),  has  joined
      the EEA national in the United Kingdom and continues to  be  dependent
      upon him or to be a member of his household



Decision of the FtT

6. The FtT found that:


     a. The sponsor has been a German citizen since 17 July 2006, when  she
        was issued with a German passport, and moved to the UK in 2007 as a
        German citizen.


     b. The sponsor is in employment earning over ï¿½30,000.

     c. The appellant moved to the UK in 2007 and has been living with  and
        dependent upon the sponsor since doing so.


7. However, it concluded that although the appellant had been  dependent  on
   the sponsor since entering the UK she was unable  to  satisfy  Regulation
   8(2) as she was not dependent on (or a member of the  household  of)  the
   sponsor before entering the UK. It found that there  was  no  documentary
   evidence of the transmission of money to Nigeria  between  the  time  the
   sponsor became a German citizen and the appellant entered the UK and that
   even if, during this time, money had  been  transported  by  friends,  as
   claimed, this would not be consistent with the  need  for  money  to  the
   extent required for dependency.


8. At paragraph [51] the FtT concluded that:

         "... there was only a limited time  when  the  sponsor  was  an  EU
         citizen in the UK exercising treaty rights.  Any  dependency  while
         the sponsor was either a Nigerian citizen or  was  not  in  the  UK
         exercising treaty rights would not enable  the  appellant  and  her
         mother to show dependency within the 2006 Regulations. The evidence
         was not sufficient to show dependency before  the  arrival  of  the
         appellant in the UK even had the period been the  entirety  of  the
         sponsor's EU citizenship."



Grounds of appeal and submissions

9. The first ground of appeal is that the FtT applied too  high  a  standard
   of proof. It is argued that, having accepted that the sponsor sent  money
   to the appellant through friends, the FtT should have recognised that the
   evidence before it was sufficient to corroborate the  appellant  and  the
   sponsor's evidence thereby establishing dependency.

10. The second ground of appeal  contends  that  the  FtT  misconstrued  the
   evidence by concluding that trips to Nigeria  by  two  of  the  sponsor's
   friends were not relevant when those trips took place whilst the  sponsor
   had German citizenship.

11. The third ground is that the FtT misdirected itself as to the  relevance
   it placed on the absence of a letter from the appellant's former employer
   confirming she had lost her job  when  her  employment  position  had  no
   bearing on the appeal.

12. The fourth ground argues that the FtT erred by finding  that  dependency
   whilst the sponsor was not in the UK exercising  treat  rights  does  not
   show dependency within the 2006 Regulations.

13. On 3 March 2016 the respondent submitted a response pursuant to Rule  24
   of the Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules in which she stated  that  she  did
   not oppose the appellant's  application  for  permission  to  appeal.  No
   reasons were given. Prior to the  hearing  the  respondent  informed  the
   Upper Tribunal that she would not be relying on the Rule 24 response.

14. At the error of law hearing, Mr Wilding formally withdrew  the  Rule  24
   response. I asked Mr Adebayo if he objected and he did not.

15.  Mr Adebayo argued that the appeal turns  on  a  narrow  point;  namely,
   whether there was sufficient evidence to support there  being  dependency
   between the date the sponsor became a German citizen  and  the  date  the
   appellant moved to the UK. He contended that  there  was.  He  maintained
   that because the relevant events transpired in 2007 it is not  surprising
   receipts of money being transferred have not been kept.  He  argued  that
   the appellant and sponsor have  provided  evidence  in  the  form  it  is
   available, through witness evidence of  friends  who  confirm  they  took
   money to the appellant during  the  relevant  time  period.  There  is  a
   pattern of money being transferred and the appellant's evidence was  that
   she relied on that money.

16.  Mr Wilding, like Mr Adebayo,  considered  that  the  appeal  turned  on
   whether dependency could be  established  during  the  period  after  the
   sponsor became a German Citizen up until  the  date  when  the  appellant
   moved to the UK. He argued that the FtT  made  clear  findings  that  the
   appellant and sponsor  were  unable  to  show  dependency  and  that  the
   evidence they sought to rely on was not persuasive.


Consideration

17. In  accordance  with  Regulation  8(2)  of  the  2006  Regulations,  the
   appellant was required to show, on the balance of probabilities, that (a)
   she was dependent on or a household member  of  the  sponsor  before  she
   entered the UK; and (b) she has been dependent on or a  household  member
   of the sponsor after entering the UK.


18. The FtT's finding as to dependency and household  membership  after  the
   appellant entered the UK is not challenged. Nor is there any  dispute  as
   to whether, before the appellant entered the UK, she was a member of  the
   sponsor's household. (She was not). The only live issue under  Regulation
   8(2) is whether the appellant was dependent on  the  sponsor  before  she
   entered the UK in 2007.

19. It was made clear in  Moneke  (EEA-OFMs)  (Nigeria)  [2011]  UKUT  00341
   (IAC) that dependency under Regulation 8(2) can only be on a  person  who
   is an EEA national at the material time. The FtT's  unchallenged  finding
   is that the sponsor became a German citizen on or  soon  before  17  July
   2006. Therefore, any dependency prior to this date will not  satisfy  the
   2006 Regulations and the  key  question  for  the  FtT  was  whether  the
   appellant was dependent on the sponsor between 17 July 2006 and the  date
   in 2007 when she entered the UK.

20. I accept the argument made in the fourth ground of appeal that  the  FtT
   made an error in delineating the period during which dependency had to be
   shown. At paragraph [51], and again at paragraph [53], the FtT found that
   the date from which dependency had to be  shown  was  not  the  date  the
   sponsor  became  German  (July  2006)  but  rather  the  date  she  began
   exercising treaty rights as an EEA national in the UK (which was sometime
   in 2007). That is not correct. There is no need, in order for  this  part
   of Regulation 8(2) to be satisfied, for  the  sponsor  to  be  exercising
   Treaty rights in the UK. Rather, what is required is that the sponsor  is
   an EEA national whose dependent  is  outside  the  UK.  Accordingly,  the
   relevant date is 17 July 2006, not the date the sponsor entered the UK.

21. However, although the FtT made an  error  in  delineating  the  relevant
   period during which dependency must be shown, the error was not material.
   The FtT's findings did not  turn  on  whether  the  start  date  for  the
   dependency was taken as July 2006 or a date  in  2007  and  had  the  FtT
   properly directed itself as to the  relevant  period  of  assessment  the
   outcome of its consideration of the  evidence  would  not  have  changed.
   Indeed, this was made clear in the decision where it is stated  that  the
   dependency  test  would  not  be  satisfied  even  if  the  period  under
   consideration had been the entirety of the sponsor's  German  citizenship
   (ie the correct period). At paragraph [51] the FtT found:

       "The evidence was  not  sufficient  to  show  dependency  before  the
      arrival of the appellant in the  UK  even  had  the  period  been  the
      entirety of the sponsor's EU citizenship."(emphasis added).

22. The appellant argues that the FtT applied the wrong  standard  of  proof
   and misdirected itself as to evidence relevant to showing her  dependency
   on the sponsor whilst she was in Nigeria. These arguments have no  merit.
   At paragraph [19] the FtT properly directed itself  as  to  the  relevant
   standard of proof and there is no  indication  in  the  decision  that  a
   higher standard has been applied.

23. There was very limited evidence before the FtT to show that, during  the
   relevant period (between July 2006 and the date in  2007  when  appellant
   entered the UK), the appellant was dependent on the sponsor. There was no
   documentary evidence of money being transferred  to  the  appellant.  Two
   friends claimed to have taken funds to the appellant during the  relevant
   period but the number  of  trips  taken  was  very  limited  (one  friend
   travelled to Nigeria in August 2006 and  the  other  in  August/September
   2007).

24. There was also only limited evidence to  establish  that  the  appellant
   depended on money transferred to her by the sponsor.  At  paragraph  [50]
   the FtT noted that the appellant was not clear as to whether she had lost
   her job in 2005 or 2007, the relevance of this being that the absence  of
   employment would help substantiate her  claim  to  be  reliant  on  funds
   transferred from the sponsor. The FtT also commented that the sponsor had
   sent money to the appellant in order to support her in raising  her  four
   children but the appellant's children had all become adults by  the  time
   the sponsor became a German citizen.



25. As the Upper Tribunal found in Moneke, dependency is  not  the  same  as
   mere receipt of some financial assistance. The recipient of support  must
   need it in order to meet essential needs. The burden of proof was on  the
   appellant to show that she was dependent on the sponsor between the  date
   the sponsor became a German citizen and the date  the  appellant  entered
   the UK. I am satisfied that, based on the evidence before it, the FtT was
   entitled, for the reasons it gave, to reach the view that  the  appellant
   failed to discharge this burden.




Decision

a. The appeal is dismissed.

b. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making  of  a
   material error of law and shall stand.
