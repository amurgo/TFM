               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     None
For the Respondent:    Mrs S Sreeman, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of India, appealed against  the  Respondent's
    decision dated 21 September 2014 to make  removal  directions,  a  form
    IS151A having been served on 21 September 2014.

2.    The  Appellant  in  exercising  a  right  of  appeal  out  of  country
    essentially sought to argue by  reference  to  his  marriage  to  a  UK
    national, Danielle Louise Maridasan, date of birth 30 May 1989, that he
    wished to return to the United Kingdom in order to make  himself  known
    to and have a family relationship with her mother and her family in the
    UK.

3.   Various directions were given and whilst it less than  clear  that  the
    Secretary of State complied with any of them, the fact was that  rather
    belatedly material was sent in advance of a consideration of  the  case
    on the papers by the Appellant.  The grounds of  appeal  appear  to  be
    dated 25 March 2015 although they are identical to grounds drafted on 7
    November 2014.  The documents provided  were  received  by  the  Arnhem
    Support Centre on 2 April 2015 and consisted of (1)  application  form,
    (2) personal letter to the judge, (3) Home Office letter (4) solicitors
    letter and email (5) property details, a r�sum�, copy of his  passport,
    copy of marine documentation relating to  his  employment,  copy  of  a
    qualification gained, copy of marine courses undertaken, copies of  sea
    service documents, bank details, passport and visa details of his  wife
    and son, medical history, as well an extensive number  of  photographs.
    The  file  also  contains  photographs  of  the  Appellant   and   wife
    undertaking a ceremony of marriage, cutting of  the  wedding  cake  and
    persons present at what appears to be a modestly sized reception

4.   Those documents, for reasons  that  are  completely  unexplained,  were
    received by the judge, after the judge had signed off the  decision  on
    21 April 2015 and it seemed likely sent it off for e-promulgation.  The
    judge's note, on the envelope containing the above documents, said this
    "Please note I received notice of these papers after I had completed my
    determination.  As such I have not taken them into account.  I  suggest
    copies are made and the  originals  are  returned  to  the  Appellant."
    Signed by the judge and dated 23 April 2015.

5.   There is no obvious explanation as to why they were  not  sent  to  the
    judge earlier but be that as it may they were received by the IAC  some
    two working weeks before the matter came to be considered by the judge.

6.   I have therefore considered whether or  not  those  documents  make  or
    might make a material difference to the outcome of the appeal,  bearing
    in mind the context  that the Appellant's wife intended to join him  in
    India: Where he had reasonably well paid employment, his own home of  a
    significant value and the ability to support  his  wife.  There  is  no
    information as to her previous circumstances, employment or  otherwise,
    in the United Kingdom.  In the event she has followed him there. So far
    as I can tell the purpose of the appeal was effectively  to  remove  an
    adverse decision against his immigration history.

7.   In the circumstances, having looked  at  that  material  and  carefully
    considered it, it seemed to me that the additional  documents  did  not
    relate to the issue of whether or not first, the Appellant's wife could
    not go and live with  him in India.  Secondly, the additional documents
    did not suggest there were any personal or other circumstances to  show
    there were insurmountable or other obstacles  to  prevent  her  staying
    with him in India. In the light of the information provided I can  find
    nothing indicated as to her ties or connections or employment or  other
    involvement in the United Kingdom which meant that it was  unreasonable
    for her to remove to India to be with her husband.  It is not suggested
    that she will be financially destitute  or  disadvantaged  by  removing
    there I note that the Appellant's mother in law has met the  Appellant,
    describing him as

         "... a very nice well mannered man  as  his  relationship  with  my
         daughter progress.  We get along so good, we have family days  with
         my other children.  We all get along and  George  is  part  of  our
         family.  I would be very sad if George had to  leave  my  daughter.
         She would be heartbroken as would all the family as George  is  one
         of us now ..."

8.   The marriage issue, on which the judge  had  not  been  satisfied,  was
    properly evidenced by one of the later documents. The  balance  of  the
    later evidence when considered did not show that her leaving the UK  to
    join the Appellant in  India  would  have  serious  consequences  which
    militated  against  her  being  expected  to  do  so  or  that  it  was
    unreasonable to expect her to do so. I do not find that the  additional
    material submitted would  have  made  any  difference  to  the  judge's
    decision on that issue  nor  to  any  other  tribunal  considering  the
    matter.

9.   The Original Tribunal  made  no  error  of  law.   The  appeal  of  the
    Appellant is dismissed.

Anonymity

10.  No anonymity order has been made and none was sought or is necessary.

Fee Award

11.  A fee has been paid in an unknown sum.  The appeal has  been  lost  and
    therefore no fee award is appropriate.
