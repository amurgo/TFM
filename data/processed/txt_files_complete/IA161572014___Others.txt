               THE Secretary of State FOR THE Home Department
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                            Mrs Durdana Hajiyeva

                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                 Respondents


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis
For the Respondents:   Mr C Jacobs


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL


 1. The appellant was granted permission to appeal a decision of  a  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge who allowed the respondents'  appeals  against  the
    Secretary of State's decision to refuse to vary leave to remain and  to
    remove by way of directions.  The matter was listed for hearing  on  18
    February 2015 before us.  At the hearing Mr Jarvis  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant sought leave to  withdraw  the  appeal.   Mr  Jacobs  had  no
    objection to this and we consented to it.

 2. For the avoidance of doubt therefore the First-tier Tribunal's decision
    allowing the appeals of all four appellants stands.



Signed        Date 18 February 2015

Upper Tribunal Judge Pinkerton
