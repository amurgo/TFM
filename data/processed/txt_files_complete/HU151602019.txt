                            DECISION AND REASONS



Introduction


      1.  The  appellant  is  a  national  of  Pakistan.  He  appealed   the
         respondent's  decision  dated  29th  August  2019  to  refuse   his
         application for leave to remain in the UK on human rights  grounds.
         The appeal to the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT") was dismissed by  FtT
         Judge Fox for reasons set out in a  decision  promulgated  on  20th
         December 2019.


      2. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted by FtT Judge
         Adio on 12th May 2020.  The matter comes  before  me  to  determine
         whether the decision of FtT Judge Fox is  vitiated  by  a  material
         error of law, and if so, to remake the decision.


      3. The hearing before me on 18th August 2020 took the form of a remote
         hearing using skype for business. Neither party objected, and I was
         satisfied that it was in the interests of justice and in accordance
         with the overriding objective to  proceed  with  a  remote  hearing
         because of the present need to take precautions against the  spread
         of Covid-19, and to avoid delay.  I was  satisfied  that  a  remote
         hearing would ensure the matter is dealt with fairly and justly  in
         a way that is proportionate to the  importance  of  the  case,  the
         complexity of the issues that arise, and the anticipated costs  and
         resources of the  parties.   At  the  end  of  the  hearing  I  was
         satisfied that both parties had been able to participate  fully  in
         the proceedings.  There were no technical issues during the  course
         of the hearing.


Background


      4. The appellant arrived in  the  UK  on  17th  May  2016  with  entry
         clearance as a medical visitor with leave valid until 4th  November
         2016. Since then the appellant has made a  number  of  applications
         for leave to remain as a medical visitor or on  the  basis  of  his
         family and private life in the UK. Each  of  the  applications  has
         either  been  rejected,  treated  as  void,  or  refused   by   the
         respondent.  Most  recently,  on  28th  March  2019  the  appellant
         submitted an application for leave to remain on private and  family
         life grounds.   The application was refused by the  respondent  for
         reasons set out in a decision dated 29th August  2019  and  it  was
         that decision that was the subject of the appeal before Judge  Fox.




      5. The background to the claim is uncontroversial and  because  it  is
         central to the claim made by the appellant, it is helpful for me to
         say a little more about the health of the appellant, taken from the
         medical evidence that was before the First-tier Tribunal.  In  2006
         the appellant, whilst living in Pakistan, the appellant had a  head
         scan  which  showed  some  changes  in  his  bone   and   following
         investigation, he was diagnosed  as  having  a  'Meningioma'.   The
         position is usefully summarised in four particular  documents  that
         were before the FtT.  The first is a  'Ophthalmic  Medical  Report'
         from Mr J M Uddin dated August 2016.   Mr  Uddin  states  that  the
         appellant had surgery in Pakistan  in  2006  and  after  a  lot  of
         swelling  his  right  eye  was  apparently  better.  In  2011,  the
         appellant had swelling  on  both  sides  and  underwent  upper  lid
         surgery following which he lost vision in the right eye. In 2011 he
         had further surgery for his visual loss.   Mr Uddin states:


             "... On examination he has no perception of light in the right
             eye with a right dense RAPD.  He has  gross  corneal  exposure
             and poor closure of the right eye as well as proptosis.


             The left eye looked as though he had slight  changes.  I  have
             arranged for him  to  have  an  ultrasound  electrodiagnostics
             (sic) and  to  be  review  (sic)  with  my  maxillofacial  and
             neurosurgical colleagues....


             The previous pathology is consistent with a meningioma.


             The electrodiagnostic examination of the right eye confirms no
             vision and severe optic nerve damage.  There  is  no  hope  to
             recover the eyesight in the right eye.


             I would advise removal of the  eye  and  a  prosthesis  to  be
             fitted for the right eye.


             The CT scanner confirms an infiltrative mass  of  the  cranium
             and forehead. On the left side, it  extends  to  the  superior
             orbit and towards the superior orbital fissure  and  cavernous
             sinus. There is evidence of previous surgery.


             Mr Rehman would like the whole tumour to be removed as much as
             possible. This would require a neurosurgical  approach  by  Mr
             Minhas. A bicoronal incision  and  extensive  craniotomy  with
             removal of the tumour over the whole of the frontal  bone  and
             extending to the superior orbital fissure and brain.


             This would leave  an  extensive  part  of  the  cranium  (bone
             covering the brain) and  superior  orbit  missing  (where  the
             tumour has been removed).


             This would be reconstructed by  Mr  Manisali  with  bone  from
             other parts of the skull (for the superior orbit) and a custom-
             made Titanium Cranioplasty to fit as a new skull.


             The surgery is complex, extensive and has risk which has  been
             discussed. The surgery may take  eight  hours.  Hospital  stay
             would be at least five days, some in an  intensive  care  type
             ward ..."


      6. Mr Uddin sets out in his report the cost of the treatment. The cost
         of the surgery, the Titanium cranial cover and  an  artificial  eye
         for the right eye, to include  pre-operative,  surgical  and  post-
         surgical fees is estimated to be a minimum of ï¿½39,000.  Second,  in
         a further letter dated 7th October 2016, Mr Uddin states:


             "This gentleman has very significant tumour involving the bone
             around the brain and the orbits. He has had  previous  surgery
             in Pakistan a number of times. This has resulted in  blindness
             in the right eye with  a  poorly  looking  right  eye.  He  is
             getting increasing pain, discomfort on the left  side  and  he
             also had visual problems. He is due to have surgery in  London
             at St George's Hospital...it is quite significant surgery that
             involves   neurosurgery   and    also    special    prosthetic
             construction.


             We plan to do surgery in the next one to two months  so  which
             may be in November or December and he will need to stay in the
             UK for at least another two months to rehabilitate.  He  would
             like to have his surgery in the UK and that was the purpose of
             his visit. I would be grateful if  you  could  assist  him  in
             extending his ability to stay here."


      7. The appellant also relied upon a letter from  Professor  Taylor,  a
         Professor of  Clinical  Oncology  and  Senior  Medical  Advisor  at
         Rutherford Cancer Centres, dated 26th March 2019 that is  found  at
         page 8 of the appellant's bundle.  The letter is addressed to Mr  G
         S Cruickshank at the Priory Hospital.  Professor  Taylor  met  with
         the appellant on 21st March 2019.  He states:


             "When I saw him, he was in relatively good spirits.  He  still
             has useful vision in his left eye. We discussed his management
             at the proton therapy MDT on Tuesday 26th of March.  We agreed
             that we should consider some form of radiotherapy  as  he  has
             never had any  treatment  with  modality  in  the  past.   The
             question is whether we can preserve vision in his left eye.


             As a first step we will be consulting with our  colleagues  in
             Philadelphia and will then come to a  consensus  view  on  the
             merits of proton therapy versus conventional radiotherapy  and
             I will contact him and his friend again in the near future.


             We realise that we cannot treat the entirety of  his  disease,
             but his main symptom and concern relates to the poor vision in
             the left  eye.  Any  form  of  radiotherapy  including  proton
             therapy will probably not spare  the  lacrimal  gland  on  the
             left. Proton therapy might have the advantage  of  sparing  as
             much as possible of the orbital contents and also  might  make
             retreatment of other areas in the future less complicated..."


      8. The appellant also relied upon  a  further  letter  from  Professor
         Taylor dated 29th October 2019 that is to be found at page 6 of the
         appellant's  bundle,  and   is   addressed   to   the   appellant's
         representatives.  In that letter,  Professor  Taylor  confirms  the
         appellant was reviewed by the clinic with regard to the possibility
         of proton radiotherapy.  Professor Taylor states:


             "... His disease is currently severely affecting  his  vision.
             He is blind in the right eye and can only count fingers on the
             left. The aim of treatment would be to  try  and  preserve  as
             much vision as possible and then for  him  to  return  to  his
             family.


             The risks of the procedure would be  that  despite  treatment,
             blindness is a risk from the combination of the tumour  itself
             and also from the treatment. I am  not  aware  of  what  other
             institution in the UK or abroad that would be  able  to  treat
             him. As you point out he has a unique set of circumstances. He
             would not be able to be treated by proton radiotherapy  in  an
             NHS centre in the UK. Regarding prognosis,  if  untreated  his
             tumour will definitely adversely affect his remaining  vision.
             Regarding life expectancy, he has a  relatively  slow  growing
             tumour recurrence which is compatible with living a number  of
             years but ultimately  will  be  incurable.  The  precise  life
             expectancy is difficult to predict..."






The decision of FtT Judge Fox


      9. At paragraph [10] of his decision, Judge Fox states:


             "I consider Article 3 and 8 ECHR in the context of N, D and GS
             (India) due to the medical issues raised in the appeal."


     10. Before Judge Fox, the appellant claimed that the total cost of  the
         medical treatment he  requires  is  approximately  ï¿½70,000  and  he
         currently has  approximately  ï¿½20,000  to  meet  those  costs.  The
         appellant claimed he had received inadequate treatment in  Pakistan
         previously, and the treatment  he  requires  is  not  available  in
         Pakistan.  It was submitted on behalf of the appellant  that  there
         will be a rapid deterioration in his health if he does not  receive
         treatment.  It was  said  that  there  is  no  proton  radiotherapy
         available in Pakistan, and neither is it available on  the  NHS  in
         the UK.  At paragraph [22] of his decision, Judge Fox  noted  there
         is no dispute that the appellant has a  serious  medical  condition
         and that he requires specialist treatment. He also noted  there  is
         no dispute that the appellant  is  unable  to  fund  his  treatment
         privately on the basis of his current financial position.


     11. At paragraph [23], Judge Fox refers to "... evidence at page 28  of
         the appellant's bundle ..." that is said to  demonstrate  that  the
         appellant was pursuing enquiries, via  medical  professionals,  for
         treatment in the USA.  Having referred to the evidence before  him,
         and in particular the letter from Professor Taylor,  at  paragraphs
         [25] and [26], Judge Fox stated:


             "25. This letter confirms that  the  appellant  is  unable  to
             avail himself of publicly funded treatment in the UK. It  also
             confirms that life expectancy is difficult to  predict.   This
             leads to the reasonable conclusion that the  appellant  cannot
             satisfy the high threshold required in Article 3 ECHR  medical
             cases.


             26.  I therefore continue to consider the evidence within  the
             prism of Article 8 ECHR; physical  and  moral  integrity.  The
             letter at page 8  of  the  appellant's  bundle  maintains  the
             medical opinion  that  the  appellant's  condition  cannot  be
             addressed in its entirety."


     12. Judge Fox refers to the cost of the treatment that was set  out  in
         the report of Mr Uddin and the funds  that  are  available  to  the
         appellant.  He noted the appellant must generate a further  ï¿½50,000
         before he is able to pursue the recommended medical treatment.   At
         paragraphs [30] and [31], Judge Fox concludes at follows:


             "30.  It  is  reasonable  to  conclude  that  the  appellant's
             immigration  status  is  not  the  barrier  to   his   medical
             treatment. Even if the respondent were to grant the  appellant
             a form of leave, there remains a financial barrier to  medical
             treatment. Conversely if the appellant is able  to  raise  the
             required funds it is likely that he would qualify for leave to
             remain as a medical visitor in the same manner as  he  secured
             entry clearance.


             31.  I accept that the instant appeal falls into a category of
             a  small  minority  of  exceptional  cases.  I  offer  sincere
             sympathy for the appellant's  position  but  for  the  reasons
             stated above the appellant's remedy does not  lie  within  the
             respondent control."


The appeal before me


     13. The appellant claims the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
         against the weight of the evidence adduced  by  the  appellant  and
         Judge Fox erroneously states in paragraph [23] of his decision that
         the document at page [28] of the  appellant's  bundle  demonstrates
         that the appellant was pursuing enquiries via medical professionals
         in the USA.   At  paragraph  [5]  of  the  grounds  of  appeal  the
         appellant claims "It is clear that proton radiotherapy is available
         to the appellant in the United Kingdom at Rutherford Cancer Centre,
         South Wales, and that such treatment  is  rare".  It  is  said  the
         appellant should therefore not be forced to return to Pakistan  and
         then make further enquiries whether such treatment can be  obtained
         in the USA, when  there  is  no  certainty  of  this  option  being
         available.  It is said the appellant has already lost vision in one
         eye, and if the appellant does not receive this treatment of proton
         radiotherapy he will lose vision in both of his eyes.  It  is  said
         removal of the appellant would delay the procedure and  will  cause
         him further unnecessary suffering.


     14. The appellant also claims, at  paragraph  [6]  of  the  grounds  of
         appeal that he meets the high threshold applicable to an Article  3
         claim in light of the decision in Paposhvilli v Belgium 41738/2010.
          The appellant claims he is already experiencing immense  suffering
         and will continue to do so if he is left untreated  without  proton
         radiotherapy treatment as he will lose his vision. It  is  said  he
         should not therefore be returned to Pakistan where  such  treatment
         is not available.  The  appellant  claims  the  treatment  is  only
         available to the appellant in the UK and  sufficient  evidence  was
         provided of this.


     15. Mr Woodhouse submits that when  addressing  the  Article  3  claim,
         Judge Fox plainly applied the wrong test.  The judge was  referring
         to the test in N and it is now known following the decision of  the
         Supreme Court in AM (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2020] UKSC 17, that that  is
         not the correct test.  Mr Woodhouse submits that at paragraph  [22]
         of his decision Judge Fox  noted  there  is  no  dispute  that  the
         appellant has a serious medical  condition.   He  referred  to  the
         letters from Professor Taylor and submits  the  proton  therapy  is
         available to the appellant.  Although Mr Woodhouse submits the cost
         of that treatment is set out in the letter  from  Mr  Uddin,  as  I
         pointed out to Mr Woodhouse, that cannot be correct.   Mr Uddin was
         not considering proton therapy but removal of the tumour that would
         require  a  neurosurgical  approach,   extensive   craniotomy   and
         reconstruction with bone from other parts of the skull and a custom-
         made Titanium Cranioplasty. There is no reference to proton therapy
         forming any part of the treatment set  out  in  the  report  of  Mr
         Uddin.  Mr Woodhouse was unable to confirm whether  the  treatments
         referred to by Mr Uddin and Professor Taylor are in any way linked,
         or are, as appears to be the case, two distinct options that may be
         available to treat the appellant.  Mr Woodhouse accepts the medical
         evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was limited.


     16. Mr Woodhouse submits that in any event, Judge Fox took into account
         irrelevant factors such as whether treatment is  available  in  the
         USA.  He submits that the only reference to treatment in the USA is
         the reference in the letter of Professor Taylor  dated  26th  March
         2019 to consultation with colleagues in Philadelphia,  as  a  first
         step, before a consensus view is reached as to the merits of proton
         therapy versus conventional radiotherapy.


     17. Finally, Mr Woodhouse submits that in his assessment of the Article
         8 claim, at paragraph [31], Judge Fox accepts that the appeal falls
         into a category of a  small  minority  of  exceptional  cases.   He
         submits that if, as here, the test of  exceptionally  is  met,  the
         only rational conclusion open to the Judge was that the removal  of
         the appellant would be in  breach  of  the  appellant's  moral  and
         physical  integrity  so  that  the  Article  8  claim  should  have
         succeeded.


     18. By way of clarification, Mr  Woodhouse  confirmed  the  appellant's
         case before the FtT was that he wishes  to  remain  in  the  UK  to
         undergo the treatment that he requires. Mr Woodhouse was unable  to
         say whether the two treatments referred  to  in  the  letters  from
         Professor Taylor and Mr Uddin  are  alternatives,  but  he  submits
         neither would be available to the appellant on the NHS.  He accepts
         that the costs of treatment by proton therapy is not set out in the
         reports that were before  the  FtT.   Mr  Woodhouse  accepted  that
         although the appellant claims to have received what he described as
         "botched treatment" in Pakistan previously, there was  no  evidence
         before the FtT that the appellant was treated inappropriately,  and
         neither was  there  any  evidence  before  the  FtT  regarding  the
         availability of the type of surgical treatment referred  to  by  Mr
         Uddin in Pakistan, or  the  costs  of  such  treatment,  if  it  is
         available.


     19. I  accept  that  at  paragraph  [23]  of  his  decision  Judge  Fox
         erroneously refers to "evidence  at  page  28  of  the  appellant's
         bundle ...".  It is clear the evidence Judge Fox had  in  mind  was
         that which is to be found at page  8  of  the  appellant's  bundle.
         That is the letter from Professor Taylor dated 26th of  March  2019
         in which Professor Taylor states that "... As a first step we  will
         be consulting with our colleagues in  Philadelphia  and  will  then
         come to a consensus view on the merits  of  proton  therapy  versus
         conventional radiotherapy ...". The references to treatment in  the
         USA, although erroneous, are not material to  the  outcome  of  the
         appeal.  Judge Fox noted at paragraph [25] of his decision, in  the
         further letter from Professor Taylor  dated 29th October 2019,  the
         appellant is unable to be treated by proton radiotherapy in an  NHS
         centre in  the  UK,   and  as  regards  life  expectancy,  that  is
         difficult to predict.


     20. It is clear that in reaching his decision, Judge Fox determined the
         appeal on Article 3 grounds by reference to the test set out  in  N
         and D.  Judge Fox cannot be criticised for doing so in light of the
         decision of the Court of Appeal in AM (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2018] EWCA
         Civ 64.  The relevant test was  considered  by  the  Supreme  Court
         following the decision of the Grand Chamber of the  European  Court
         of Human Rights ("the ECtHR") delivered in  Paposhvilli  v  Belgium
         [2017] Imm AR 867.  The Supreme Court handed down its judgement  on
         29th April 2020, and that judgement postdates the decision of Judge
         Fox.  The question for me is whether any error is material  to  the
         outcome of the appeal.


     21. On the evidence that was before Judge  Fox,  the  error  is  in  my
         judgement immaterial.  Mr Woodhouse referred to paragraph [183]  of
         the decision of the ECtHR in Paposhvilli and submits that the  very
         exceptional  cases  referred  to  in  N  now  includes   situations
         involving  the  removal  of  a  seriously  ill  person   in   which
         substantial grounds have been shown for believing that he  or  she,
         although not at imminent risk of dying, would face a real risk,  on
         account of the absence of appropriate treatment  in  the  receiving
         country or the lack of access to such treatment, of  being  exposed
         to a serious, rapid and irreversible decline in his or her state of
         health resulting in intense suffering or to a significant reduction
         in life expectancy.


     22. On the facts here, and the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal,
         the appellant cannot in my judgment benefit from  the  decision  of
         the Supreme Court in AM (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2020] UKSC EWCA Civ  64.
         It is correct to say that in Paposhvilli, the ECtHR considered  the
         "other  very  exceptional   cases   in   which   the   humanitarian
         considerations are  equally  compelling"  and  held,  at  paragraph
         [183], that they should now be taken  to  include  cases  in  which
         there were substantial grounds for believing  that  the  applicant,
         while not at imminent risk of dying, would face a real risk in  the
         receiving country of being exposed either to a serious,  rapid  and
         irreversible decline in health resulting in intense  suffering,  or
         to a significant reduction in life expectancy.  The  Supreme  Court
         held the Court of Appeal was mistaken in taking the ECtHR's phrase,
         "a  significant  reduction  in  life  expectancy",  to  mean   "the
         imminence of death" [30]. At paragraphs [30] and [31]  Lord  Wilson
         said:


             "30. There is, so I am driven to  conclude,  validity  in  the
             criticism of the Court of Appeal's interpretation of  the  new
             criterion. In its first sentence the reference  by  the  Grand
             Chamber to "a significant reduction  in  life  expectancy"  is
             interpreted as "death within a short time". But then,  in  the
             second  sentence,  the  interpretation   develops   into   the
             "imminence ... of ... death"; and,  as  is  correctly  pointed
             out, this is achieved by  attributing  the  words  "rapid  ...
             decline" to life expectancy when, as written, they apply  only
             to "intense suffering". The result is that in two sentences  a
             significant reduction in life expectancy has become translated
             as the imminence of death. It is too much of a leap.


             31.  It remains, however, to consider what the  Grand  Chamber
             did mean by its reference to a "significant" reduction in life
             expectancy in para 183 of its judgment in the Paposhvili case.
             Like the skin of a chameleon, the adjective takes a  different
             colour so as to suit a different  context.  Here  the  general
             context is inhuman treatment; and the  particular  context  is
             that the alternative  to  "a  significant  reduction  in  life
             expectancy" is "a serious, rapid and irreversible  decline  in
             ...  health  resulting  in  intense  suffering".  From   these
             contexts  the   adjective   takes   its   colour.   The   word
             "significant"  often  means  something  less  than  the   word
             "substantial". In context, however, it must in  my  view  mean
             substantial. Indeed, were a reduction in life expectancy to be
             less than substantial, it would not attain the  minimum  level
             of severity which article 3  requires.  Surely  the  Court  of
             Appeal was correct to suggest, albeit in  words  too  extreme,
             that a reduction in life  expectancy  to  death  in  the  near
             future is  more  likely  to  be  significant  than  any  other
             reduction. But even a reduction to death in  the  near  future
             might be significant for one person but not for another.  Take
             a person aged 74, with an expectancy of life normal  for  that
             age. Were that person's expectancy be  reduced  to,  say,  two
             years, the reduction might well - in this  context  -  not  be
             significant. But compare that person with one aged 24 with  an
             expectancy of life normal  for  that  age.  Were  his  or  her
             expectancy to be reduced to two  years,  the  reduction  might
             well be significant.


     23. As Lord Wilson also set out in paragraphs  [23]  and  [32]  of  his
         judgment, in Paposhvili, the ECtHR also set  out  requirements,  at
         paragraphs [186] to [191], for the  procedure  to  be  followed  in
         relation to applications  under  Article  3  to  resist  return  by
         reference to  ill-health.  It  was  for  the  appellant  to  adduce
         evidence  capable  of  demonstrating  that  there  are  substantial
         grounds for believing that, if removed, he would be  exposed  to  a
         real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary  to  Article  3.
         The Supreme Court confirmed that that is a demanding threshold  for
         an applicant. His or her evidence must be capable of  demonstrating
         "substantial" grounds for believing that it is a "very  exceptional
         case"  because  of  a  "real"  risk  of  subjection  to   "inhuman"
         treatment. An applicant must put  forward  a  case  which,  if  not
         challenged or countered, would establish a violation of Article  3.
         At paragraph [32], Lord Wilson said:


             "The Grand Chamber's pronouncements  in  the  Paposhvili  case
             about the procedural requirements of Article 3, summarised  in
             para  23  above,  can  on  no  view  be   regarded   as   mere
             clarification of what the court had previously  said;  and  we
             may expect that, when it gives judgment in  the  Savran  case,
             the Grand Chamber  will  shed  light  on  the  extent  of  the
             requirements. Yet observations on them may even  now  be  made
             with reasonable confidence. The basic principle  is  that,  if
             you allege a breach of your rights, it is for you to establish
             it. But "Convention proceedings  do  not  in  all  cases  lend
             themselves to a rigorous application of [that] principle ...":
             DH v Czech Republic (2008) 47 EHRR 3, para 179.  It  is  clear
             that, in application to  claims  under  article  3  to  resist
             return by reference  to  ill-health,  the  Grand  Chamber  has
             indeed modified that principle. The threshold, set out in para
             23(a) above, is for the applicant to adduce evidence  "capable
             of  demonstrating  that  there  are  substantial  grounds  for
             believing" that article 3  would  be  violated.  It  may  make
             formidable  intellectual  demands   on   decision-makers   who
             conclude that the evidence  does  not  establish  "substantial
             grounds" to have to proceed to consider  whether  nevertheless
             it is "capable of demonstrating" them.  But,  irrespective  of
             the perhaps unnecessary complexity of the  test,  let  no  one
             imagine that it represents an  undemanding  threshold  for  an
             applicant to cross. For the requisite capacity of the evidence
             adduced by  the  applicant  is  to  demonstrate  "substantial"
             grounds for believing that it is  a  "very  exceptional"  case
             because of a "real" risk of subjection to "inhuman" treatment.
             All three parties accept that Sales LJ was  correct,  in  para
             16, to describe the threshold as an obligation on an applicant
             to raise a "prima facie case"  of  potential  infringement  of
             article 3. This means a  case  which,  if  not  challenged  or
             countered, would establish the infringement: see para 112 of a
             useful analysis in the Determination of the President  of  the
             Upper Tribunal and two of its senior judges in AXB v Secretary
             of State for  the  Home  Department  [2019]  UKUT  397  (IAC).
             Indeed, as the tribunal proceeded to explain in para 123,  the
             arrangements in the UK are such that the decisions whether the
             applicant has adduced evidence to the requisite standard  and,
             if so, whether it has been successfully countered fall  to  be
             taken initially by the Secretary of State and, in the event of
             an appeal, again by the First-tier Tribunal.


     24. Lord Wilson held, at paragraph [33], that if the applicant presents
         evidence  to  that  standard,  the  returning  state  can  seek  to
         challenge or counter it. The Supreme Court  found  that  Paposhvili
         states that, in doing so, the  returning  state  must  "dispel  any
         doubts raised" by the evidence; but "any  doubts"  here  should  be
         read to mean any serious doubts.


     25. There are in my judgement significant gaps in the evidence that was
         before the  First-tier  Tribunal  such  that  even  upon  a  proper
         application of the test as set out  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  AM
         (Zimbabwe) the outcome of the appeal would be the  same.  Taken  at
         its highest, the evidence  relied  upon  by  the  appellant  cannot
         establish on any reasonable view, that while not at  imminent  risk
         of dying, the appellant would face a real risk in Pakistan of being
         exposed either to a serious,  rapid  and  irreversible  decline  in
         health  resulting  in  intense  suffering,  or  to  a   significant
         reduction in life expectancy.  As matters  stand,  the  unfortunate
         position that  the  appellant  finds  himself  in  the  UK,  is  no
         different to that which the appellant  will  find  himself  in,  in
         Pakistan.  He is not  currently  receiving  treatment  in  the  UK.
         Professor  Taylor,  who  considered  treatment  by  way  of  proton
         radiotherapy considered the prognosis and stated that if untreated,
         the  tumour  will  definitely  adversely  affect  the   appellant's
         remaining vision.  As regards life  expectancy,  he  expresses  the
         opinion that the appellant has a  relatively  slow  growing  tumour
         recurrence which is compatible with living a number  of  years  but
         ultimately  will  be  incurable.   He  states  the   precise   life
         expectancy is difficult to predict.


     26. In March 2019, Professor Taylor noted that as  a  first  step,  the
         Rutherford Cancer Centre would be  consulting  with  colleagues  in
         Philadelphia and would then come to a consensus view on the  merits
         of  proton  therapy  versus  conventional  radiotherapy.   In   his
         subsequent letter dated 29th October 2019,  Professor  Taylor  does
         not set out the outcome of  any  consultation  with  colleagues  in
         Philadelphia and whether any consensus view has been reached as  to
         the merits of  proton  therapy  versus  conventional  radiotherapy.
         Although Professor Taylor confirms that the aim of treatment  would
         be to try and preserve as much vision as possible, he confirms that
         despite treatment, blindness is a risk from the combination of  the
         tumour itself  and  also  from  the  treatment.   He  confirms  the
         appellant would not be able to be treated by proton radiotherapy in
         an NHS centre in the UK. There was no  evidence  before  Judge  Fox
         regarding the continuing merits of such  treatment  or  the  likely
         cost. Without such evidence it would be impossible to determine how
         long the appellant may require to raise the necessary funds to fund
         the treatment, but what is clear is that that the  appellant  would
         be no worse off in Pakistan than in the UK.


     27. Insofar as the evidence of Mr Uddin is  concerned,  although  there
         was evidence of the complex surgery that could be undertaken in the
         UK at a minimum cost of ï¿½39,000, there was no evidence  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal at all that such a surgical procedure would not
         be available in Pakistan or that the appellant would be  unable  to
         access such treatment.  In the respondent's decision of 28th August
         2019, the respondent noted the appellant  had  previously  received
         treatment in Pakistan for his current condition and considered that
         treatment is therefore available in Pakistan. It is  common  ground
         that the appellant is funding his own treatment in the UK, and  the
         respondent had noted that private medical care/treatment  would  be
         available to the appellant in Pakistan and there is no evidence  to
         establish that  he  would  be  unable  to  fund  the  treatment  in
         Pakistan.


     28. Taken at its highest, the medical  evidence  that  was  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal does not establish  that  the  appellant  would
         face a real risk in Pakistan of being exposed to a  serious,  rapid
         and irreversible decline in health resulting in intense  suffering.




     29. I reject the submission made by Mr Woodhouse that  having  accepted
         that the appeal falls into the category  of  a  small  minority  of
         exceptional cases, the only rational conclusion open to  the  Judge
         was to allow the  appeal  on  Article  8  grounds.   As  Judge  Fox
         properly noted at paragraph [30] of his decision it  is  reasonable
         to conclude that the appellant's  immigration  status  is  not  the
         barrier to his medical treatment. Even if the  respondent  were  to
         grant the appellant a form of leave, he would be unable  to  access
         the medical treatment that he requires.


     30. In GS (India) v SSHD [2015] EWCA  Civ  40,  Underhill  LJ  said  at
         [111]:


             "First the absence or inadequacy of  medical  treatment,  even
             life preserving treatment, in the country of return, cannot be
             relied on at all as a fact engaging article 8: if that is  all
             there is, the claim must fail. Secondly, where  article  8  is
             engaged by other  factors,  the  fact  that  the  claimant  is
             receiving medical treatment in this country which may  or  may
             not be available in the country of return may be a  factor  in
             the  proportionality  exercise;  but  that  factor  cannot  be
             treated as by itself giving rise to a breach since that  would
             contravene the no obligation to treat principle."


     31. In SL (Saint Lucia) v SSHD [2018]  EWCA  Civ  1894,  the  Court  of
         Appeal considered whether Paposhvili had any impact on the approach
         to  Article  8  claims  but  rejected  that  submission.  At  [27],
         Hickinbottom LJ said:


             "As I have indicated and as GS  India  emphasises,  article  8
             claims have a different focus  and  are  based  upon  entirely
             different criteria. In particular, article 8 is not article  3
             with merely a lower threshold: it does not provide  some  sort
             of safety net where  a  medical  case  fails  to  satisfy  the
             article 3 criteria. An absence of  medical  treatment  in  the
             country of return will not in itself  engage  article  8.  The
             only relevance to article 8 of such an absence will  be  where
             that is an additional factor in the balance with other factors
             which themselves engage article 8?.


     32. All that the appellant relies upon here in support of his Article 8
         claim is his wish to continue with medical  treatment  in  the  UK,
         albeit that he is not receiving treatment at the moment, but he may
         raise sufficient funds to fund the treatment at some point  in  the
         future. That in itself is insufficient to establish  an  Article  8
         claim.  It follows that in my  judgement,  there  was  no  material
         error in the decision of Judge Fox capable of affecting the outcome
         of the appeal and the appeal is dismissed.


DECISION


     33.  The appeal is dismissed and the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge Fox shall stand.
