Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss Dulay, (Counsel), instructed by Sam Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I do not make an anonymity direction.

 2. The appellants are Nepalese  nationals.   The  appellants  applied  for
    entry clearance on the basis of family life outside of the  Immigration
    Rules on  April  1,  2015.  Their  applications  were  refused  by  the
    respondent on April 22, 2015.

 3. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on June 3,  2015  under  Section
    82(1) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.   Their
    appeals came before Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Norton-Taylor
    (hereinafter called "the Judge") on December 12, 2016 and in a decision
    promulgated on January 9, 2017 the Judge refused  their  appeals  under
    article 8 ECHR.

 4. The appellants appealed the decision on February 2, 2017. Permission to
    appeal was refused by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Doyle on  August
    14, 2017. Permission to appeal was renewed to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on
    September 1, 2017  and  permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Plimmer on October 17, 2017. In giving  permission,  she
    found it arguable the Judge may have adopted a  confused  approach  and
    misdirected himself to the respondent's policy on adult children of ex-
    Ghurkhas.

 5. The matter came before me on  the  above  date  and  the  parties  were
    represented as set out above.

    SUBMISSIONS

 6. Miss Dulay adopted the grounds of appeal and identified two areas  that
    she believed demonstrated there had been an error in law.

 7. The first area concerned the  Judge's  approach  to  Devaseelan  [2002]
    UKIAT 00702. She submitted the Judge had concentrated on  the  previous
    decision rather than looking at what  had  happened  since  namely  the
    ongoing contact and financial support that continued. Whilst the  Judge
    looked at the evidence he failed to assess the appeal having regard  to
    the new evidence.

 8. The second area and perhaps crucial part of the appeal was the  Judge's
    finding that there was no family life as defined by article 8(1)  ECHR.
    She submitted that this finding went contrary to the views expressed by
    the Court of Appeal in Jitendra Rai v ECO [2017] EWCA Civ  320.  Whilst
    this decision came out after the Judge heard the  appeal  the  guidance
    was applicable to the facts of this case. Adverse findings on  why  the
    parents migrated or the lack of contact since the parents came to  this
    country were not sufficient to break family life if family life existed
    before the parents came to this country. When the  appeal  came  before
    the Judge he acknowledged there was ongoing  contact,  two  visits  and
    continuing financial support. Following the guidance in Rai  the  Judge
    should have found family life existed and allowed the appeals.

 9. Mr Tufon relied on the Rule 24  response  and  indicated  that  if  the
    Tribunal was of the view there was family life under article 8(1)  ECHR
    then in light of  the  historic  injustice  argument  he  would  accept
    refusing entry would be disproportionate. However, he argued  that  the
    Judge had properly considered the evidence and  had  given  11  reasons
    from [31] of the decision onwards for why  there  was  no  family  life
    under article 8 ECHR.

    FINDINGS ON THE ERROR IN LAW

10. This is the second appeal that  has  been  brought  by  the  appellants
    against decisions to refuse them entry clearance under Appendix FM  and
    article 8 ECHR grounds. Their first appeals were heard by Judge of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Gibbs on November 3, 2014 and it is  accepted  that
    those appeals were dismissed with appeal rights exhausted  in  February
    2015.

11. The appellants lodged  the  current  applications  arguing  that  their
    appeals should be allowed under article 8 ECHR.

12. At [29] of his decision the Judge posed the central  question  in  this
    appeal namely "is there family life between the  appellants  and  their
    parents?". The Judge then proceeded to set out eleven reasons why there
    was no family life  on  these  facts.  I  summarise  these  reasons  as
    follows:

      a) When the case was originally heard  by  Judge  Gibbs  in  2014  she
         concluded  the  appellants  had  been  studying  and   caring   for
         themselves in reasonable living circumstances.

      b) The appellants' parents planned to settle in the United Kingdom  in
         the knowledge that the appellants could not join them.

      c) The appellants were financially maintained  by  their  parents  but
         this did not show that family life existed.

      d) Two visits to Nepal have been made albeit these had  to  be  viewed
         against the background that they were the only visits between  2010
         and the present day. These visits were not evidence of family life.



      e) The appellants and their  parents  maintained  regular  contact  by
         telephone or internet but these did not go beyond normal  love  and
         affection.

      f) No intervening adverse circumstances since the  last  decision  was
         made.

      g) The respondent's policy (Annex K in IDIs) did not materially affect
         these appeals because family life was disputed.

      h) No attempts by the appellants to visit their parents since 2010.

      i) The history of family separation is a significant indicator of  the
         absence of family life notwithstanding  the  financial  constraints
         facing  the  appellants'  parents  and  their  need  to   establish
         themselves in the United Kingdom. The parents left  the  appellants
         and went to live in Brunei for two years and  did  not  visit  them
         again until 2014.

13. The Court of Appeal in Rai gave guidance on the approach a court should
    take when considering whether  family  life  under  article  8  of  the
    European Convention existed. The Court made it  clear  that  the  court
    must consider the following:

      a) Whether "real" or "committed" or "effective" support was  shown  to
         exist.

      b) Whether, as a matter of fact, the appellants had demonstrated  that
         they had a family life with his parents, which had existed  at  the
         time of their departure to settle in the  United  Kingdom  and  had
         endured beyond it, notwithstanding their  having  left  Nepal  when
         they did.

      c) In consequence of the "historic injustice", it  was  only  in  2010
         that the appellants' father had been able to  apply  for  leave  to
         enter the United Kingdom.

      d) Would they have applied upon their father's discharge from the army
         had that been possible?

      e) Had the appellants had ever left the family home in Nepal, begun an
         independent family life of their own, or  found  work  outside  the
         village.

      f) Had they remained "an integral part of the family unit" even  after
         their parents had settled in the United Kingdom.

14. It is against this background that I have  considered  the  grounds  of
    appeal.

15. The difficulty with the  previous  decision  of  Judge  Gibbs  is  that
    decision was not considered against the background of the  respondent's
    January 2015 policy on adult Ghurkha dependants. Judge Gibbs would have
    considered issues of family life against the background of  R  (on  the
    application of Gurung and others) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2013] 1 WLR 2546, and the decisions of the Upper  Tribunal
    in Ghising and others (Gurkhas/BOCs - historic wrong - weight) [2013]
    UKUT  567  (IAC) and Ghising  (family  life  -  adults   -   Gurkha
    policy) [2012] UKUT 160 (IAC) but not against  the  respondent's  2015
    policy which can be found at Annex K in the respondent's IDI policies.

16. The family matrix appears to be that the appellants  lived  with  their
    parents until they went to  live  and  work  in  Brunei  in  2008.  The
    evidence before the Judge was the appellants continued  to  live  under
    their guidance whilst they were in Brunei  and  after  the  appellants'
    father was granted leave  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  the  parents
    returned to Nepal and from there they went to the United  Kingdom.  The
    father's statement made it clear that the appellants had no other close
    family in Nepal. Neither child was married and the  father  paid  their
    health  care,  education,  accommodation  and  transport  costs.   Both
    appellants were still at college and lived in rented accommodation paid
    for by their father. Their father explained in  his  oral  and  written
    evidence that they were unable to visit as often as they would want due
    to monetary constraints although now the appellants' parents receive  a
    monthly income of around �2,900 plus a monthly pension of �250.

17. Looking at the Judge 's findings it seems that  adverse  findings  were
    made in respect of the parents'  intention  to  settle  in  the  United
    Kingdom regardless of whether the appellants could join them, a finding
    that financial support did not amount to family life, limited visits to
    see the appellants regardless of their financial  circumstances  and  a
    finding that the respondent's policy did not affect their situation.

18. The decision of Rai had not been handed down when the Judge heard  this
    appeal but as it is a Court of Appeal decision the content applies.  At
    [13] above  I  have  set  out  what  the  Court  would  look  for  when
    considering whether  article  8  family  life  existed.  Applying  that
    guidance, the Judge should have addressed whether there was family life
    when the family lived together and whilst the parents went to  work  in
    Brunei for around 18 months the  evidence  before  the  Judge  was  the
    parents continued to provide a  home  and  financial  support  for  the
    appellants. This was "real" or "committed" or "effective" support.

19. The Judge's finding that there was no family life when the parents came
    to the United Kingdom is based on what Judge Gibbs had stated. In fact,
    the Judge tied himself to that finding at [32] of his decision when  he
    stated, "The Judge's findings of fact were always  going  to  create  a
    real obstacle to the appellants' cases now".

20. The Judge accepted that since being in the United Kingdom regular phone
    contact had continued despite the distances involved but criticised the
    parents for not visiting more often. The Court in  Rai  made  it  clear
    that being unable to travel for financial reasons should  not  be  held
    against the appellant and this contradicted  the  Judge's  approach  at
    [37] and [38]. The evidence given was that if the appellants  had  been
    allowed to come here sooner then the parents would have brought them.

21. I am satisfied having considered all the issues, and  whilst  accepting
    Judges in article 8 appeals  may  come  to  different  decisions,  that
    factors highlighted as important for the appellants  in  Rai  were  not
    given the correct weight by the  Judge.  I  also  accept  Miss  Dulay's
    submission that placing too much  emphasis  on  Judge  Gibb's  decision
    distracted the Judge from the task in hand.

22. Based on the guidance in Rai I am  satisfied  that  family  life  under
    article 8 ECHR existed between the appellants and  their  parents  both
    before the parents came to the United Kingdom and since.

23. Having established that family life existed Mr Tufan accepted that  the
    historic injustice weighed heavily in  the  proportionality  assessment
    that  would  be  carried  out  under  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  00027.  The
    provisions of section 117A and B of the 2002 Act  would  not  apply  in
    light of what was contained between [55] and [57] of Rai.

24. For the reasons set out above I find there was a material error in  law
    and I accept that there as there was family life between the appellants
    and their parents then their appeals should succeed.

    DECISION

25. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.  I set aside the decision.

26. I remake the decision and allow the appeal on human rights grounds.
