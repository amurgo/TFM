Representation:

For the appellant:          Mr. A Govan, Senior Presenting Officer
For the respondent:       Mr A Devlin of Latta and Co. Solicitors

Introduction

   1. In these proceedings the Secretary of State is appealing the decision
      of First-tier Tribunal Clough who allowed the appellant's appeal under
      article 8. For convenience I will continue to refer to the parties
      hereinafter as in the First-tier Tribunal.

   2. The appellant is a national of Iraq who studied in Iran. He met his
      future wife there. She is an Iranian national, and they married in
      2000. They spent their married life in Iran where they had two
      children, K, born on 23 September 2003 and F, born on 17 October 2012.



   3. On 24 January 2015 he came to study in the United Kingdom, bringing
      his family. He made a claim for protection on 30 September 2017. He
      claimed he is no longer entitled to reside in Iran as his student Visa
      had been cancelled. He also said that his daughters are not entitled
      to any citizenship. His eldest daughter had been granted citizenship
      but he said this was a mistake and has since been cancelled. He also
      claims that his wife and children are not entitled to Iraqi
      citizenship. In any event, the family are unable to live in Iraq
      because of the general situation in the country.

   4. His claim was refused on 30 June 2017. It was accepted he was a
      national of Iraq. It was initially accepted that he could not return
      to Iran but this concession was subsequently withdrawn. The respondent
      did not accept his family were not entitled to Iraqi citizenship and
      concluded they could go to the southern provinces which are generally
      safer. He and his wife are Shia Arabs who speak Arabic.

   5. His appeal was heard on 26 April 2018 at Glasgow. It transpired that
      his wife had made her own protection claim along similar grounds and
      this was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge McGavin. One of the
      issues related to the appellant's entitlement to Iranian nationality.
      First tier Judge Clough was aware of the earlier decision and had the
      benefit of an expert report on nationality. Based upon this she took a
      different view from First-tier Tribunal Judge McGavin and concluded
      that this appellant and his younger daughter would not be able to
      return to Iran to live. She then turned to consider the situation in
      Iraq. The judge concluded that the appellant and his family could live
      there and would not face any real risk. The judge then turned to
      consider article 8. The judge indicated that but for the children the
      respondent's decision was proportionate.

   6. The judge refers to the section 55 duty. She refers to K having been
      referred to the adolescent mental health services in Glasgow about the
      possibility she had attention deficit hyperactive disorder. The father
      said she had attended a psychologist in Iran who made this diagnosis.
      The local psychologist agreed she fulfilled the criteria for ADHD. She
      was also assessed by paediatric occupational therapists and it was
      noted that she held a pen or pencil awkwardly because of hyper-
      flexibility in her fingers. The judge then referred to all of the
      evidence relating to the diagnoses of ADHD.The judge referred to the
      high level of support for the child in school and found that she would
      not easily access her prescribed medication if at all in Iraq and
      would not have the same level of educational and social support as
      here. Consequently, the judge concluded the respondent's decision was
      disproportionate. The judge made a passing reference to section 117 B
      at paragraph 43 and 52 inferring the factors therein were against the
      appellant but finding the respondent's decision nevertheless
      disproportionate.

   7. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on the basis
      that disparity between medical treatments in countries did not render
      a decision disproportionate. Reliance was placed upon the decision GS
      India [2015] 1WLR. This concerned foreign nationals who were being
      treated for serious medical conditions and it was contended that if
      removed treatment would not be available in their home countries and
      they would die.in relation to one of the appellant's the Court of
      Appeal referred to article 8 differing from article 3 in that the
      former protected the quality of life not its continuance and that the
      absence of adequate medical treatment would only be relevant as an
      additional factor in the proportionality exercise. The application
      referred to paragraph 111 of the decision of Lord Justice Underhill:

          First, the absence or inadequacy of medical treatment, even life-
         preserving treatment, in the country of return, cannot be relied on
         at all as a factor engaging article 8: if that is all there is, the
         claim must fail. Secondly, where article 8 is engaged by other
         factors, the fact that the claimant is receiving medical treatment
         in this country which may not be available in the country of return
         may be a factor in the proportionality exercise; but that factor
         cannot be treated as by itself giving rise to a breach since that
         would contravene the "no obligation to treat" principle.


   8. There was also arguably a failure to consider the public interest
      consideration set out in section 117 B.

At hearing.

   9. The presenting officer pointed out that none of the children involved
      were qualifying children. He submitted that the judge treated the
      eldest child's diagnoses of ADHD as the only factor for allowing the
      appeal. At paragraph 51 was the judge said there could be issues over
      her obtaining medication in Iraq what no details were given.

  10. He pointed out that the judge had not set out any consideration of the
      section 117 B factors. He submitted the judge was obliged to have
      regard to those factors and they were not an ï¿½ la carte menu but all
      had to be considered. I was referred to Rhuppiah (Appellant) v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent) [2018] UKSC
      58.the Supreme Court considered specifically 117B (5) pointing out
      that everyone who has leave to reside here other than indefinitely has
      a precarious immigration status. Whilst there was no need to consider
      degrees of precariousness the provisions provided for a limited degree
      of flexibility, both by reference to "little weight" and by virtue of
      section 117A(2)(a) via the phrase "must (in particular) have regard".
      This was directed towards an exceptional case where there were
      particularly strong features. The judge did not explain why the public
      interest in immigration control was outweighed in the circumstance.

  11. Mr Devlin appeared for the appellant, as he did in the First-tier
      Tribunal. He argued that the judge correctly approached the appeal,
      focusing upon the best interests of the children. He submitted that
      the judge did consider section 117 B, albeit the specific features
      were not set out. I was referred to Dube (S 117A-D) [2015] ImmAr 651
      where the Upper Tribunal held whilst judges are required to take into
      account the specific considerations; whether this was done was an
      issue of substance, not form. I was also referred to Foreman (SS117A-C
      considerations) [2015] ImmAR 6 where was pointed out that whilst the
      tribunal is obliged to have regard to all the considerations in
      section 117 B. In certain situations this could be inferred from what
      was said. In the instant case the judge alluded to section 117 B on
      several occasions. He also sought to argue that children were in a
      specific category when considering the approach to health cases.

  12. In response, the presenting officer said that an article 8 assessment
      had to be holistic and consider all the family members. He said the
      family had no status in the United Kingdom and the judge only made
      passing reference to section 117 B. There was no reference to any
      integration of financial independence. The focus was unduly upon the
      eldest child's medical condition.

Conclusions.

  13. The case law well establishes the high threshold applicable to succeed
      on health grounds in a claim. In SL (St Lucia) v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ
      1894 the Court of Appeal said that the focus and structure of Article
      8 is different from Article 3.  An absence of medical treatment in the
      country of return would not of itself engage Article 8.  The only
      relevance would be where that was an additional factor with other
      factors which themselves engaged Article 8. This is really a
      continuation of what was said in GS India [2015] 1WLR .

  14. It is clear from the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Clough,
      notably at paragraph 42, that the appeal only succeeded because of the
      position of the 2 children, particularly the eldest child. Mr Devlin
      pointed out that many of the cases cited referred to adults and the
      consideration for children is different. I accept that where children
      are involved then the approach is different. Section 55 has to be
      factored in. The focus must be upon the child's best interests. This
      is before any proportionality exercise. However, having determine
      where the child's best interest lies this is not determinative. This
      must then be balanced against other considerations, notably, the
      general consideration of immigration control the general circumstances
      of the family. In this regard to section 117 B factors are relevant
      and obligatory considerations.

  15. The article 8 issue arising is private life. The family life is being
      retained because the respondent's intention is that the family will be
      returned as a unit. In this context the precarious nature of the
      family's immigration status is relevant.

  16. I find the judge has failed to adequately explain the features which
      justified allowing the appeal under article 8. The judge does not
      indicate how the high threshold applicable was met. The case law has
      established that disparity of treatment between is not determinative.
      Whilst the approach towards children's cases is different from adults
      I am unaware of any principle that dilutes the high threshold
      applicable in medical cases.

  17. The judge does not specifically set out section 117 B factors. However
      as I read paragraph 43 and the phraseology in paragraph 51, it can be
      inferred the judge acknowledges that those features count against
      allowing the appeal. This therefore is all the more reason for
      questioning the basis upon which the appeal was allowed.

Decision.

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Clough allowing the appeal under
article 8 materially errs in law and is set aside. The appeal is to be
reheard de novo in the First-tier Tribunal on the issue of article 8.
