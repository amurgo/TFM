Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Wood of Immigration Advice Service Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Iran who was born  on  19th  March  1994.
    He arrived in the United Kingdom  on  3rd  December  2010  and  claimed
    asylum.  That claim was refused on 17th  June  2011  but,  because  the
    appellant was a minor at the  time,  discretionary  leave  was  granted
    until 19th September that year.  A further  application  for  leave  to
    remain was  made  on  13th  September  2011  and  was  refused  by  the
    respondent on 4th April 2012.  The appeal  against  that  decision  was
    dismissed by First-tier Tribunal De Haney on 20th June 2012.

2.   Permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  was  subsequently  refused
    and appeal  rights  were  exhausted  on  25th  October  2012.   Further
    representations were made on behalf of the appellant on  27th  February
    2015 and they were refused by the respondent on 10th July 2017.

3.   Still further representations  were  made  in  December  2018  and  the
    appellant made a fresh claim for asylum under paragraph  353  based  on
    new  evidence  which  post-dated   his   original   application.    The
    application was refused by the respondent on 25th January 2019 and  the
    appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  His appeal was heard in
    Manchester on 10th April 2019 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Buckley.

4.   At paragraph 25 of the judge's  determination  Judge  Buckley  accepted
    that the previous determination promulgated in 2012  was  the  starting
    point  for  the  consideration  of  this  appeal  in  accordance   with
    Devaseelan (Second Appeals - ECHR - Extra-Territorial Effect) Sri Lanka
    * UKIAT 00702 [2002] UKIAT 00702.  Unfortunately, having accepted that,
    the judge failed  to  consider  the  new  evidence  placed  before  him
    properly.  He failed to attach any weight to the KDPI letters  adduced,
    because the previous claim had been found not to be credible.

5.   Mr Bates accepted that the judge should have  given  more  reasons  for
    not attaching weight to the KDPI letter, but as far as the  appellant's
    witness is concerned, he was in fact granted asylum  on  the  basis  of
    being a Christian convert and not for any political reasons.

6.    He agreed, however, with Mr Wood that the determination should be  set
    aside and that the matter should be reheard by the First-tier  Tribunal
    by a judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Buckley  or  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge De Haney.  The determination is set aside and the appeal
    remitted to the First Tier Tribunal.   The  appellant  has  effectively
    been denied a fair hearing by the judge's failure  to  properly  follow
    and apply the decision in Devaseelan.

7.   Two hours should be allowed  for  the  hearing  of  the  appeal  and  a
    Kurdish Sorani speaking interpreter will be required.
