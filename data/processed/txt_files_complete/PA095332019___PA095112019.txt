Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Holmes
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants were born respectively on 4  November  1976  and  on  25
    March 1996. The first appellant is the mother of the second  appellant.
    They are both citizens of  Russia.  They  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against  a  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  dated  24
    September  2019   refusing   their   applications   for   international
    protection. The First-tier Tribunal, in a decision promulgation  on  21
    November 2019, dismissed the appeals. The appellants now  appeal,  with
    permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Mr McVeety, who appeared for the Secretary of State  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal at the initial hearing, told me that he did not seek to defend
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal. He submitted  that,  in  part,
    the judge had made findings of fact which were  not  supported  by  any
    reasoning; for example, at [18], the  judge  stated  that  he  did  not
    'accept that [the appellants] have satisfied the evidential  burden  to
    show that they  were  subsequently  followed  and  intimidated  by  the
    Russian authorities [following their attendance at the demonstration].'
    The decision is silent as to why the judge did not accept that part  of
    the account of the appellants. Secondly, at [24], the judge stated that
    'it  is  fair  to  say  that  the  Russian  authorities  in   arresting
    demonstrators are acting within the scope of Russian law.'  Mr  McVeety
    submitted that that observation failed to address  the  level  of  ill-
    treatment which may have occurred during or following arrest; moreover,
    the fact that conduct may  be  permitted  under  Russian  law  did  not
    necessarily mean that such conduct would not be breach the human rights
    of the appellants.

 3. I agree with the representatives that the decision cannot stand for the
    reasons articulated in the  grounds  of  appeal  and  helpfully  by  Mr
    McVeety at the initial hearing. I set the decision  aside.  There  will
    need to be a new fact-finding exercise  and  that  exercise  is  better
    conducted in the First-tier Tribunal. Both representatives agreed  that
    I should preserve findings made in the First-tier Tribunal by which the
    judge accepted parts of the accounts of the appellants. Those  findings
    are to be found at  [8-12].  All  other  findings  are  set  aside.  In
    addition, the grounds of appeal are correct in pointing  out  that  the
    judge failed to apply the principles of HJ (Iran) [2010] UKSC  31;  the
    next Tribunal will also need to address that aspect of the appeal.

         Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside. The  findings  of
    fact by which the judge accepted parts of the account of the appellants
    and which are set out at [8-12] are preserved. All  other  findings  of
    fact are set aside. The appeal is returned to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    for that Tribunal to remake the decision following a hearing.
