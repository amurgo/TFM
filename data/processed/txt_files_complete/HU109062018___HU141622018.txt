Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr G Hodgetts of counsel, instructed directly
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The Secretary of State appeals,  with  permission  granted  by  the  FTt
   (Judge Mark Davies), against a decision which was issued by  Judge  Adio
   on 14 December 2018, allowing the appeals of Mr Mehmood and Ms  Bibi  on
   human rights grounds.



Background

2. The respondents are Pakistani nationals who were born on 5 May 1977  and
   14 March 1985 respectively.  The first respondent entered the  UK  as  a
   student in 2007.  He  was  granted  further  leave  to  remain  in  that
   capacity until 2011, after which he received two further grants of leave
   to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant.  On 2 June 2016, he applied for
   further leave to remain in that capacity.  Whilst  his  application  for
   leave to remain was under consideration, he accrued  ten  years'  lawful
   residence in the UK, and varied his application so that  it  became  one
   for ILR under paragraph 276B  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  second
   respondent joined the first respondent in the UK in June  2013  and  her
   permission to remain in the UK has at all times been dependent upon his.



3. In May 2018, the Secretary  of  State  refused  the  first  respondent's
   application under paragraphs  276B(ii)  and  (iii),  with  reference  to
   322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  The  second  respondent's  application
   was refused 'in line'.  The basis for the refusal was explained  in  the
   letter of refusal and in a witness statement made by an officer  of  Her
   Majesty's  Revenue  and  Customs  ("HMRC")  named  Joanne  Iwanski.   In
   summary, it was said that there was  a  discrepancy  of  around  ï¿½17,000
   between the earnings declared by the first respondent to  HMRC,  on  the
   one hand, and to the Secretary of State, on the other.

4. The discrepancy arose over the course of two tax  years:  2010/2011  and
   2012/2013.   In  both  years,  the   first   respondent   had   declared
   significantly less income to HMRC than he had in  his  applications  for
   further leave to remain under Tier 1 of the Points  Based  System.   The
   respondent had considered the first respondent's explanation  for  these
   discrepancies and she did not accept that it was the fault of  his  then
   accountants.  She considered that he had either sought illegitimately to
   reduce his tax liability by making a lower declaration to HMRC  or  that
   he had sought to secure leave to remain under  Tier  1  by  artificially
   inflating his earnings.  She concluded that  such  conduct  rendered  it
   undesirable to permit the first  respondent  to  remain  in  the  United
   Kingdom.  As I  have  said,  the  second  respondent's  application  was
   refused as a consequence of the decision on her husband's application.

Appellate History

5. The respondents  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (IAC).   Their
   appeals were heard and allowed by Judge Adio.  Having  directed  himself
   correctly on the burden and standard of proof, the judge concluded  that
   the respondent had discharged the initial evidential burden upon her  by
   raising the discrepancies I have outlined above:  [21].   He  considered
   the oral evidence given by the first respondent.  He concluded  that  he
   was not an evasive witness, contrary to the submission by the Presenting
   Officer.  He considered that the first respondent had answered questions
   to the best  of  his  ability.   Judge  Adio  accepted  that  the  first
   respondent was aware, in 2018, of the amount of tax which he  should  be
   paying but he noted that the position had  been  different  in  the  tax
   years under consideration.  At that stage, the first respondent had been
   more concerned about his net pay rather than the amount of tax which had
   been deducted.  2010/2011 had been his first tax return  and  'there  is
   quite a lot of room for trial and  error'.   He  accepted  that  it  was
   credible that the first  respondent  had  sought  to  reduce  the  costs
   incurred by using an unregulated firm of accountants, and  that  he  may
   have taken his 'eye off the ball' in  the  tax  year  2012/2013,  during
   which period they had been expecting their first child  and  the  second
   respondent had been suffering from tuberculosis.

6. Judge Adio noted that the first respondent's former accountants,  Nafiya
   Financial Services, had accepted responsibility for  the  errors:  [22].
   Whilst no representative from the firm had attended  to  give  evidence,
   they had explained how the errors had come about, in that  the  turnover
   and business expenses in 2010/2011 had not been correctly  assessed  and
   reported due to the use of incorrect formulae in  Microsoft  Excel.   In
   the tax  year  2012/2013,  the  data  provided  to  them  by  the  first
   respondent had been incorrectly  entered  onto  a  spreadsheet,  thereby
   generating incorrect and incomplete information which had been  provided
   to HMRC.  Judge Adio concluded that the first respondent  had  given  an
   innocent explanation for the discrepancies, which was supported  by  the
   letter from Nafiya Financial Services.

7. At [23], Judge Adio 'noted' that HMRC had accepted subsequent amendments
   without imposing penalties upon the first respondent.  He concluded that
   the first respondent had been entitled to trust his accountants and that
   he had been 'a bit  careless'  in  failing  to  verify  the  information
   provided in his tax returns.   He  considered  that  there  had  been  a
   plausible explanation provided.  He concluded that the first  respondent
   had been careless and that carelessness did not amount to dishonesty for
   the purposes of paragraph  322(5).   There  being  no  other  ground  of
   refusal under the Immigration Rules, Judge Adio found that  those  Rules
   were met and he allowed the appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

8. The  respondent  appealed  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.   The  grounds  are
   discursive and confusingly numbered but the essential  points  made  are
   these.  Firstly, it was submitted that the FtT had erred in  failing  to
   follow the guidance given by Martin Spencer J in R (Khan) v SSHD  [2018]
   UKUT 384 (IAC) in considering the first respondent's explanation for the
   discrepant sums involved.  Secondly, it was submitted that the judge had
   erred in treating the absence of a penalty from HMRC as being  'in  some
   way determinative of whether the appellant's actions can  be  viewed  as
   dishonesty'.  In the latter connection, the grounds cited the  decisions
   of the Upper Tribunal in R (Samant) v SSHD JR/6546/2017 (Collins J)  and
   R (Abbasi) v SSHD JR/13807/2016 (UTJ Rimington).

9. As I have said, permission to appeal  was  granted  by  FtT  Judge  Mark
   Davies in February 2019.  The Secretary of State's appeal was  heard  by
   Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Chana on  13  March  2019.   In  a  reserved
   decision which was issued on 28 March 2019, Judge Chana  concluded  that
   Judge Adio had erred materially in law in the manner  contended  in  the
   grounds of appeal.  She ordered that the appeal should  be  remitted  to
   the FtT for consideration de novo.

10. In AA (Iraq) [2018] 1 WLR 1083, the Court of Appeal disapproved  of  the
   decision in VOM [2016] UKUT 410 (IAC); [2017] Imm AR 117, insofar as the
   Upper Tribunal had held that no appeal could be brought  to  the  former
   against a decision of the latter  remitting  a  case  to  the  FtT.   In
   reliance on that conclusion, the respondents sought permission to appeal
   to the Court of Appeal before their  remitted  appeal  could  be  heard.
   That application came before Upper Tribunal Judge Gill, who  decided  to
   review the decision made by DUTJ Chana.

11. In a decision which was sent to the parties on  9  May  2019,  UTJ  Gill
   decided, subject to any representations  made  by  either  party  within
   fourteen days, that DUTJ Chana  had  arguably  failed  to  take  binding
   authority (R (Iran) v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 982)  into  account  and  had
   therefore applied too high a threshold as  to  the  duty  of  the  first
   instance judge to give reasons for his decision.  There having  been  no
   further representations made within fourteen days, Judge Gill set  aside
   DUTJ Chana's decision and directed that the Secretary of State's  appeal
   would be re-listed for fresh consideration before the Upper Tribunal.

12. So it was that the appeal came before me earlier today.

Submissions

13. Mr Hodgetts helpfully indicated at the outset that his  arguments  would
   follow the grounds he had settled to the Court of  Appeal.   Ms  Everett
   did not have those grounds.  Mr Hodgetts provided her with  a  copy  and
   she was ready to proceed very shortly thereafter.

14. Ms Everett's submissions were characteristically concise and  realistic.
    She accepted that Judge Adio had not fallen into legal error by failing
   to cite R (Khan) v SSHD.  She also accepted that  Khan  was  a  judicial
   review decision in which the lawfulness  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
   decision was in issue.  Whilst different considerations were in play  in
   a statutory appeal such  as  the  present,  Khan  nevertheless  provided
   useful guidance.  Judge Adio had accepted the  explanation  advanced  by
   the first respondent regarding the discrepancy.  In  doing  so,  he  had
   relied on the letter written by his former accountants.  The error  into
   which Judge Adio  had  fallen  was  to  fail  to  consider  whether  the
   explanation provided by  the  accountants  was  plausible.   Ms  Everett
   submitted that the accountant's explanation was clearly  inadequate  and
   that the judge had failed to  give  clear  reasons  for  accepting  that
   explanation.  Nor had there been any consideration by Judge Adio of  why
   it had taken the first respondent and his advisers so  long  to  realise
   the error which had supposedly been  made.   The  result  was  that  the
   respondent was unable to understand the basis upon which  she  had  been
   unsuccessful in the appeal.  The judge had therefore failed  to  provide
   reasons which satisfied the test in R (Iran) v SSHD.

15. For the respondents, Mr Hodgetts  submitted  that  there  was  no  legal
   error in Judge Adio's decision.  Ultimately, the question for the  judge
   was not whether there was a discrepancy but whether the reason for  that
   discrepancy was deception on the part  of  the  first  respondent.   The
   judge had been required to consider the first respondent's mens  rea  at
   the time.  Relying on Hemeng v SSHD [2007] EWCA  Civ  640,  Mr  Hodgetts
   submitted that it was not required of a tribunal of  fact  to  say  more
   than it had fully accepted the evidence of a witness.   Judge  Adio  had
   been entitled to accept the evidence given by the first respondent.  The
   letter from the accountant was simply corroboration of what he had  said
   and the judge had been entitled to attach some weight to that letter  in
   his evaluation of the evidence as a whole.  He submitted that the  judge
   had made findings on the factors suggested by  Martin  Spencer  J  in  R
   (Khan) v SSHD even if that judgment had not actually been cited  in  his
   decision.

16. In response, Ms Everett indicated her acceptance of  some  of  what  had
   been said by Mr Hodgetts.  The judge had seemingly followed the guidance
   in R (Khan) v SSHD even if he had not cited it and the respondent's only
   challenge was to the adequacy of the reasoning in [22], where the  judge
   had considered the letter from the accountants.

17. At  the  conclusion  of  submissions,  I  indicated  that  Judge  Adio's
   decision would stand and that  my  reasons  for  that  conclusion  would
   follow in writing.  My reasons are as follows.

Discussion

18. I can deal briefly with those aspects of the  grounds  of  appeal  which
   were not actively pursued by Ms Everett.  Insofar as it was suggested by
   the Secretary of State that the judge fell into error by failing to cite
   R (Khan) v SSHD, that submission cannot prosper.

19. As Sedley LJ said in SR (Iran) [2007] EWCA Civ 460,  the  issue  is  not
   whether the judge went through the right motions but  whether  he  asked
   himself the right question.  R (Khan) v SSHD,  R  (Samant)  v  SSHD  and
   other decisions were  before  Judge  Adio,  at  pp151-243  of  the  then
   appellants' bundle.  It is clear from Judge  Adio's  [19]  that  he  was
   taken to the decision in R (Khan) v SSHD by Mr Gajjar  of  counsel.   In
   that paragraph, the judge recorded that Mr Gajjar  (who  had  also  been
   counsel in R (Khan) v SSHD) had withdraw an application to  rely  on  an
   unreported decision because 'there is a latest [sic]  reported  decision
   which goes against the issue of paragraph 322(5) and its application'.

20. The structure of the judge's analysis at [20]-[23] and the  language  he
   used in that section of  the  decision  clearly  suggests  that  he  was
   cognisant of Martin Spencer J's judgment.  He referred, on more than one
   occasion, to deciding whether  the  first  respondent  had  merely  been
   'careless' in his dealings with HMRC, which is the  same  term  used  by
   Martin Spencer J in his guidance at [37](iv), where he refers to  a  tax
   return being 'dishonest or merely careless'.   Other  findings  made  by
   Judge Adio tend to suggest, as Ms Everett  was  constrained  to  accept,
   that he was addressing his mind to the specific questions  suggested  by
   Martin Spencer J.  At [21] of Judge Adio's  decision,  for  example,  he
   accepted the first respondent's evidence that he had taken his "eye  off
   the ball" at times because his wife had been pregnant and suffering from
   TB.  That appears to represent engagement on the part of the judge  with
   one of the questions posed by Martin Spencer J: "Why did  the  appellant
   not realise that an error had been made because his liability to pay tax
   was less than he should have expected?"  As  I  have  said,  Ms  Everett
   quite properly accepted that the decision in R  (Khan)  v  SSHD  was  in
   Judge Adio's mind, even if it was not cited in his decision.

21. The Secretary of State's grounds  also  suggested  that  the  judge  had
   fallen into error by treating the absence of a penalty from HMRC  as  in
   some way 'determinative' of the issue of whether  the  first  respondent
   had been dishonest.  I note, in that respect, the  decision  reached  by
   Collins J in R (Samant) v SSHD.  This was a judicial review decision  in
   which the applicant sought to submit, inter alia,  that  the  respondent
   had irrationally found that the applicant had cheated because  HMRC  had
   not taken any steps to impose  a  penalty.   Resolving  that  submission
   adversely to the applicant, Collins J said that he did "not  think  that
   the fact that HMRC has decided  not  to  take  any  further  action  can
   indicate that the decision of the Secretary of State is  one  which  was
   irrational".  That must, with  respect,  be  correct  but  it  does  not
   preclude a judicial decision-maker from taking the point  into  account.
   It is simply inaccurate to suggest, as did the author  of  the  grounds,
   that Judge Adio treated that as "determinative".  On  the  contrary,  he
   simply stated that he 'noted' the point, and he was entitled to  do  so.
   In fairness to Ms Everett, she did not attempt to develop the  point  in
   her oral submissions.

22. What Ms Everett did submit, however, was that the Judge  had  failed  to
   consider, in accordance with [37](vi)(i) of Martin Spencer J's  guidance
   in R (Khan) v SSHD, whether the explanation for the  error  provided  by
   the accountant is plausible.  She also submitted  that  Judge  Adio  had
   failed to give adequate reasons for concluding that the explanation  was
   plausible.

23. The first and most obvious point to make is that the  guidance  provided
   by Martin Spencer J was guidance to Home Office case workers considering
   cases of this nature.  It does not purport to  be  prescriptive  and  it
   certainly does not, contrary to the  stance  seemingly  adopted  in  the
   respondent's grounds, set out a list  of  mandatory  considerations  for
   judicial decision makers.  That guidance did not tie the  hands  of  the
   judge at first instance to evaluate the evidence in a certain  way.   It
   was incumbent upon him  to  apply  the  burden  and  standard  of  proof
   correctly and to provide reasons which sufficed to show the losing party
   (in this case the Secretary of State) why she had lost.

24. I do not accept the broad submission made by Mr Hodgetts that  it  would
   have sufficed for the judge, in a case of this nature, simply  to  state
   that he accepted the evidence of  the  first  respondent.   Whether  one
   considers R (Iran) v SSHD or any other authority on  the  duty  to  give
   reasons, it is clear that the extent of that duty depends on the  nature
   of the case under consideration.  Here, the Secretary of State presented
   evidence of substantial discrepancies between the sums declared  to  the
   two departments and the first respondent  produced  an  explanation  for
   those  discrepancies,  supported   by   various   documents,   including
   correspondence from his former accountants and  medical  evidence  which
   related to  the  second  respondent.   The  respondent  made  a  serious
   allegation and it was for the judge to  set  out  not  only  whether  he
   accepted the first respondent's version of events but why he did so.

25. Judge Adio could have said more about the adequacy  of  the  explanation
   provided by the accountants, although it is  far  from  clear  that  the
   Presenting Officer, whose  submissions  are  recorded  at  [18]  of  the
   decision, attempted to suggest that their explanation was  insufficient.
   When the assessment he undertook is considered as a  whole,  however,  I
   consider that Judge Adio gave sufficiently clear reasons for  concluding
   that the Secretary of State had not discharged  the  burden  of  proving
   that the first respondent's conduct had been  deceitful.   He  concluded
   that this man, who had only started just started dealing with  the  HMRC
   shortly before the period in question, had been careless in his dealings
   and had placed trust in accountants who were frankly incompetent.  Judge
   Adio accepted what the first respondent said about  his  wife's  medical
   conditions and concluded that he had taken his "eye off the  ball"  when
   it came to his tax affairs  because  his  wife  had  been  pregnant  and
   suffering from TB. This was a finding reached after seeing  and  hearing
   the first respondent give evidence.  The advantage that gives the  trial
   judge are not to  be  overlooked,  particularly  where  (as  here),  the
   experienced judge evaluated with some care whether  the  evidence  given
   was evasive or just rather hesitant.   I bear in mind what was  said  by
   Lord Hoffman at [54] of Biogen v Medeva [1996] UKHL 18:

         "The need for appellate caution in reversing the judge's evaluation
         of  the  facts  is  based  upon  much  more  solid   grounds   than
         professional courtesy. It is because  specific  findings  of  fact,
         even by the most meticulous judge,  are  inherently  an  incomplete
         statement of the impression which was made upon him by the  primary
         evidence.  His  expressed  findings  are  always  surrounded  by  a
         penumbra of imprecision as  to  emphasis,  relative  weight,  minor
         qualification and nuance (as Renan said, la  vï¿½ritï¿½  est  dans  une
         nuance), of which time and language do not permit exact expression,
         but which may  play  an  important  part  in  the  judge's  overall
         evaluation. It would in  my  view  be  wrong  to  treat  Benmax  as
         authorising or requiring an appellate court to undertake a de  novo
         evaluation of the facts in all cases in which no  question  of  the
         credibility of witnesses is involved. Where the  application  of  a
         legal standard  such  as  negligence  or  obviousness  involves  no
         question of  principle  but  is  simply  a  matter  of  degree,  an
         appellate court should be  very  cautious  in  differing  from  the
         judge's evaluation."

26. I consider this to be a case  to  which  those  dicta  apply  with  some
   force.   Ultimately,  the  judge  had  to  decide  whether   the   first
   respondent's  conduct  had  been  deceitful.   He  considered  his  oral
   evidence, alongside the other evidence before him and concluded that  it
   had not been.  He was not required to  deal  any  more  fully  with  the
   evidence before him and the respondent's grounds of appeal fall into the
   trap identified by Haddon Cave J (as  he  then  was)  in  VHR  (Jamaica)
   [2014] UKUT 367 (IAC), of seeking to "burrow out industriously areas  of
   evidence that have been less fully dealt with than others  and  then  to
   use this as a basis for saying the judge's decision is legally  flawed".



27. I consider that the reasons given by the judge for finding in favour  of
   the first respondent were sufficiently clear.  The respondent is able to
   understand the basis upon which the appeal was  decided.   Nothing  more
   was required,  and  no  legal  error  on  the  part  of  Judge  Adio  is
   established.  In the circumstances, his decision shall stand.

Notice of Decision

No error of law has been established  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal, which shall accordingly stand.

No anonymity direction is made.

                      Judge of the Upper Tribunal (IAC)
                              05 December 2019
