For the Appellant:     Ms J Rothwell (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   On 8th November 2013, the Secretary of State decided to refuse to  vary
    the appellant's leave to remain in the United Kingdom and to remove him
    by way of directions under section 47 of the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.  His appeal against those decisions was dismissed
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge Buckwell ("the judge") in a  decision  and
    reasons promulgated on 22nd September 2014.  The appellant relied  upon
    his human rights in his appeal, it being accepted that the requirements
    of the Immigration Rules ("the rules") were not met.  At the  heart  of
    his case lay his relationship with his partner, Sally Ffrench, and  the
    family  life  claimed  to  exist  between  them.   Having  weighed  the
    evidence, which included evidence of anxiety suffered  by  Ms  Ffrench,
    the judge concluded that although he had no doubt that the relationship
    was genuine and currently subsisted the balance to  be  struck  between
    the competing interests fell in favour of the Secretary of  State.   He
    found that it would not be unreasonable  to  expect  the  appellant  to
    return to India, from where he and his  partner  could  maintain  their
    relationship (his partner being able to visit if she felt  able  to  do
    so).  The appellant could make an application to return to  the  United
    Kingdom from India, in accordance with the rules.

2.   An application was made for permission to appeal on the basis  of  what
    were described as "errors of fact" amounting to a misdirection  by  the
    judge, a failure  to  attach  appropriate  weight  to  evidence  and  a
    misdirection on section 117B of the 2002 Act.

3.   In particular, it was contended that the judge misdirected  himself  in
    relation to or misunderstood the extent of Ms Ffrench's current anxiety
    and the appellant's ability to obtain work in the United  Kingdom.   He
    gave insufficient weight to  evidence  given  by  Ms  Ffrench's  mother
    regarding Ms Ffrench's anxiety and reliance upon  the  appellant.   The
    judge's assessment of Ms Ffrench's anxiety as something not  attracting
    great weight in the proportionality assessment was  unsustainable.   So
    far as section 117B is concerned, it was contended in the grounds  that
    the judge wrongly applied section 117B(3) and did not make  a  specific
    finding upon whether the appellant would be able to  earn  �18,000  per
    annum by means of employment.   It  appeared  that  the  judge  wrongly
    considered and applied section 117B(4), on the apparent basis that  the
    relationship with Ms  Ffrench  was  established  at  a  time  when  the
    appellant  was  in  the  United  Kingdom  unlawfully.   In  fact,   the
    relationship began while he had  leave  as  a  student  and  his  leave
    continued by virtue of section 3C of the  Immigration  Act  1971.   The
    judge referred to Shahzad [2014] UKUT 85 and Ahmad [2014] EWHC 300  but
    these concerned private life ties and do not apply to students who have
    formed a genuine and existing family life.   This  was  made  clear  by
    section 117B(5), which applies to those who have formed a private  life
    when their status is precarious.  If the  judge's  interpretation  were
    correct, no one with limited leave who formed  a  genuine  family  life
    would meet the public interest test and Parliament cannot have intended
    this.

4.   Permission to appeal was granted on 4th December 2014.  In  a  Rule  24
    response from the Secretary of State, the appeal was opposed.   So  far
    as self-sufficiency was concerned, the judge noted a discrepancy in the
    salary that the appellant might receive in the United Kingdom  and  was
    entitled to take that into account.  So far as Ms Ffrench's anxiety was
    concerned, the Secretary of State submitted that her  mother  was  able
    and willing to support her, as in the past.  The appellant did not meet
    the requirements of the rules in Appendix FM.  The judge carried out  a
    proportionality exercise which was free from error and made findings of
    fact open to him on the evidence.



Submissions on Error of Law

5.   Ms Rothwell said that the appeal was  always  an  "outside  the  rules"
    case.  The judge erred when striking the balance in his proportionality
    assessment.  He made  errors  of  fact  and  placed  little  weight  on
    relevant evidence on the appellant's side.  When considering the public
    interest question, he erred in relation to section 117A  to  D  of  the
    2002 Act.

6.   A factual error was made in relation to  the  appellant's  partner,  Ms
    Sally Ffrench, regarding whether  counselling  she  received  had  been
    concluded.  In fact, she had moved and Ms Ffrench was registered with a
    new GP.  The judge did not take this into account at paragraphs 38  and
    41 of the decision.  A second error concerned  the  future  income  the
    appellant might earn.  The judge found a discrepancy in this regard, at
    paragraph 40.  The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  included  a
    letter from an employer in the appellant's bundle at page 52.   In  the
    second paragraph of that item, the appellant was  described  as  having
    been offered a permanent contract, with  scope  for  progression.   His
    current salary was �18,000.  The appellant gave evidence and was  asked
    how he saw the future and he indicated, as noted at paragraph 11,  that
    his current salary would go up.  The  judge  made  findings  about  his
    ability to work, relevant to section 117A to  D.   He  found  that  the
    appellant's claim to be financially self-sufficient was not tested  and
    that a discrepancy existed but this was a misdirection.  There was room
    for the appellant's salary to increase.

7.    Another  error  concerned  Ms  Ffrench's  anxiety.   Her  mother  gave
    evidence, as shown at pages 19 and 20 in the appellant's first  bundle,
    of the severe harm to  her  daughter's  health.   All  three  witnesses
    addressed Ms Ffrench's mental health.  The judge recorded the  evidence
    in paragraphs 12 and 13 of the decision.  In his findings, at paragraph
    41, he broadly accepted it but concluded that  it  should  not  attract
    great weight.  However, all three witnesses gave detailed evidence.

8.   The other major ground concerned section 117B of  the  2002  Act.   The
    judge dealt with the financial side at paragraph 40  of  the  decision.
    The letter from the appellant's company showed that they  were  willing
    to employ him.  The appellant had been present in the United Kingdom as
    a student for some years, having arrived in September 2010.  There  was
    a letter from a future employer and payments showing that he was  self-
    sufficient and spoke English.  Paragraphs 40 and 41 showed the  judge's
    analysis, where he took into  account  section  117A  to  D.   He  made
    findings regarding the development of the relationship  during  periods
    of limited leave.  However, section 117B(4) was to do with private life
    and precarious status.  This showed a misdirection.  The judge accepted
    that there was family life.  When he looked at  the  appellant's  side,
    the judge made errors and  misdirected  himself  regarding  the  public
    interest question.

9.   Ms Isherwood said that the judge had not erred in law and  the  grounds
    revealed only a disagreement with his findings.  It was  accepted  that
    the case fell outside the rules,  not  least  because  the  appellant's
    finances were insufficient.  However,  the  judge  properly  took  into
    account the fact that the requirements of the rules were not  met.   So
    far as Ms Ffrench's anxiety were concerned, she was  seeking  full-time
    employment, having completed her studies.  The judge accepted that  she
    had received counselling.  Her mother made a witness  statement  which,
    at paragraph 2, referred to her daughter having suffered anxiety.   The
    judge did not overlook a letter regarding future  employment.   As  the
    appellant could not show that he had sufficient finances  to  meet  the
    requirements  of  the  rules,  the  judge  was  entitled  to  make  the
    assessment he did and to take into account section 117A  to  D  showing
    that the appellant might be a burden on the  tax  payer.   There  might
    well have been scope for an increase in the appellant's salary but  the
    evidence at the time showed that the requirements  of  the  rules  were
    simply not met.  The judge did  not  overlook  the  evidence  regarding
    anxiety but it appeared that medical treatment had  been  concluded  by
    February  2014.   That  was  why  Ms  Ffrench  was  seeking  employment
    thereafter.  The judge noted the evidence that the appellant's presence
    relieved Ms Ffrench's anxiety, as her mother's presence and support had
    previously.  Should the anxiety worsen, Ms Ffrench might have to return
    to her parents again.  The judge did not err in his assessment in  this
    context.  Nothing was overlooked.

10.  The judge was entitled to find a discrepancy regarding the  appellant's
    salary as the evidence did not show that he had any  imminent  prospect
    of earning sufficient to meet the rules.  The  conclusions  reached  at
    paragraphs 40 and 41 were, again, open to the judge.  He  was  entitled
    to take into account Ms Ffrench's anxiety but not give it much  weight.
    The judge acknowledged a degree of dependence  by  Ms  Ffrench  on  the
    appellant and took this into account  as  one  of  the  factors  to  be
    weighed.  His conclusion that the appeal fell to be dismissed was  open
    to him.

11.  In a brief response, Ms Rothwell said that it  was  conceded  that  the
    appellant's income did not reach �18,600 and so it was clear  from  the
    outset that  the  judge  was  required  to  consider  Article  8  on  a
    freestanding basis.   Section  117A  to  D  set  out  relevant  factors
    relating to the public interest question.  The judge appeared  to  have
    been confused between the private life and family  life  factors.   The
    appellant spoke English and had an offer of work.  There  was  no  real
    discrepancy regarding the amount of his earnings.  He was present  here
    lawfully and did not seek to make out his case on the basis of  private
    life ties, although the judge may have thought that this was so in  the
    light of his mention of Shahzad.  The appellant relied on family  life.
    Overall, the judge misdirected himself on the  application  of  section
    117B of the 2002 Act.

Conclusion on Error of Law

12.  The decision is extremely  thorough,  as  one  would  expect  from  the
    experienced judge who wrote it.  He recorded the  documentary  evidence
    before him (at paragraph 7) and summarised the oral evidence  given  by
    the appellant, Ms Ffrench and Ms Ffrench's mother.   There  followed  a
    summary of the submissions  made  by  the  experienced  representatives
    present.

13.  So far  as  an  error  of  fact  concerning  Ms  Ffrench's  anxiety  is
    concerned, I conclude from a careful reading of the decision  that  the
    judge made no error at all.  The assessment  at  paragraph  39,  noting
    that Ms Ffrench has in the past been prescribed medicines and  received
    counselling but that, as at the date of hearing,  she  was  not  taking
    medicines and her counselling sessions had concluded, was open to  him.
    The contention in the grounds that the judge misdirected himself as  to
    Ms Ffrench's current anxiety is simply not made  out.   His  assessment
    was carefully made and took into account the evidence  of  counselling,
    therapy and medicines and  (as  made  clear  in  Ms  Ffrench's  witness
    statement) the support given by the appellant in this regard.

14.  Similarly, the judge took  into  account  the  evidence  regarding  the
    appellant's earnings and financial circumstances.  The letter from  his
    employer (appellant's bundle page 52) showed that his  current  salary,
    as at October 2013, was �18,000 per  annum.   The  judge  recorded  the
    appellant's evidence that he saw his future in  a  favourable  way  and
    that it would pay well and  "would  be  between  �28,000  and  �30,000"
    (paragraph 11 of the decision).   He was entitled to observe  that  any
    suggestion that the appellant might be financially self-sufficient  had
    not been tested and his mention of a  discrepancy  in  the  salary  the
    appellant might receive is, I find, properly read as a comment  on  the
    substantial difference between the appellant's current salary  and  the
    salary he might obtain in the future.  The judge  had  the  appellant's
    view of his prospects in mind, as is clear from  paragraph  11  of  the
    decision.

15.  There is no merit in the contention that the  judge  failed  to  attach
    appropriate weight to evidence from Ms Ffrench's  mother.   Again,  the
    decision shows that he carefully summarised it (at  paragraphs  22  and
    23) and took it into account in his overall  assessment.   His  finding
    that Ms Ffrench's anxiety was a modest factor  in  the  proportionality
    assessment was open to him in the light of the evidence.  The weight to
    be given to particular factors was a matter for  him  and  the  grounds
    fall short of showing any error of law here.  The decision  shows  that
    the judge's overall  conclusion  followed  an  assessment  of  all  the
    evidence before him and he did not overlook any particular feature.

16.  Finally, so far as section  117B  of  the  2002  Act  is  concerned,  I
    conclude that the judge did not err or wrongly apply section 117B(3) or
    (4).  So far as the  former  sub-section  is  concerned,  the  decision
    includes  a   careful   assessment   of   the   appellant's   financial
    circumstances and the judge clearly had regard, in paragraph 40, to the
    question of financial independence.  As  noted  earlier,  he  was  well
    aware  of  the  evidence  showing  the  appellant's  earnings  and  the
    appellant's own view of what those earnings  might  amount  to  in  the
    future.  Read carefully, paragraphs 40  and  41  of  the  determination
    reveal the judge's reasoning and there  is  no  confusion  between  the
    private life and family life aspects of  the  case.   There  really  is
    nothing to show that he wrongly considered and applied section 117B(4).
     Rather, the decision shows that he had  in  mind  his  duty  to  "have
    regard" to the considerations listed in section 117B and  to  make  his
    own assessment.  He did not, I find, misunderstand any salient  feature
    of the case.  For example, paragraph 41 shows that the judge  was  well
    aware that the relationship with Ms Ffrench began at a  time  when  the
    appellant was here lawfully, with limited leave.

17.  In the grounds, it is contended that the  judge's  mention  of  Shahzad
    and Ahmed shows an error, as these cases concerned the establishment of
    private life ties.  With great respect to the author  of  the  grounds,
    this is disingenuous.  The cases are mentioned in paragraph 35, in  the
    context of the fast developing  case  law  on  Article  8  and  at  the
    conclusion of that paragraph, the judge directs himself that he  should
    apply the guidance given in Razgar [2004]  UKHL  27  and  MM  (Lebanon)
    [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985.   There  is  nothing  in  the  judge's  overall
    assessment, at paragraphs 37 to 41, suggesting any error of law.

18.  Finally, the decision  contains  nothing  to  suggest  that  the  judge
    considered that those who have  formed  a  genuine  family  life  while
    present here with limited leave to remain  cannot  "fulfil  the  public
    interest test", as suggested at paragraph 16 of  the  grounds.   It  is
    clear that the judge maintained a proper focus  on  the  facts  of  the
    particular case and made his assessment in the light  of  the  evidence
    before him.

19.  Overall, I conclude that no error of law, still less a material  error,
    has been shown.  The judge has given cogent reasons for his  conclusion
    that the appeal fell to be dismissed.  The decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal shall stand.

DECISION

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal, containing no error of  law,  shall
stand.

ANONYMITY

There  has  been  no  application  for  anonymity  at  any  stage  in  these
proceedings and I make no direction on this occasion.
