For the Appellant:     Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mrs R Bagral, Counsel instructed by Marks & Marks
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The  appellant,  hereafter  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the   Home
    Department, has permission to challenge the decision of Judge  Mill  of
    the First-tier Tribunal dated 20 September 2018 allowing the appeal  of
    the respondent, hereafter the claimant, against the decision made on  9
    January 2018 refusing her leave to remain.  The  first  claimant  is  a
    citizen of Pakistan, as are the second and third claimants who are  her
    husband and child respectively.

2.   The basis of the refusal  by  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department  (SSHD)  was  that  the  claimant's  application  for   long
    residence was to be refused because she had used deception  in  respect
    of her tax affairs.  The SSHD therefore refused the  application  under
    paragraph  of  the  Immigration  Rules  with  reference  to   paragraph
    276B(ii)(c), asserting that it  would  be  undesirable  for  the  first
    claimant to be given indefinite leave to remain on the grounds of  long
    residence taking into account her personal history including character,
    conduct, associations and  employment  record.  The  SSHD  additionally
    relied upon the general grounds of refusal contained  within  paragraph
    322(5).

3.   The Secretary of State's position was that the first claimant had  made
    false declarations within her tax returns for the years ending in April
    2011 and April 2013.  It was stated  that  the  first  claimant  either
    falsely inflated  her  income  for  the  purposes  of  her  immigration
    applications for those years, or alternatively  declared  less  taxable
    income to HMRC so as to avoid payment of tax.  The originating facts in
    relation to the declaration to HMRC are not in dispute.  In  the  first
    claimant's application dated March 2011, which was an  application  for
    leave to remain under Tier 1 (General) Migrant, she claimant claimed to
    have  had  previous  earnings  totalling  �40,780.   In  terms  of  the
    declaration to HMRC by way of her tax return for the same  period,  the
    total declared was �13,659.  Within the  first  claimant's  application
    dated 16 May for leave to remain as a  Tier  1  (General)  Migrant  she
    claimed to have had previous earnings of �37,043.   The  total  however
    originally declared to HMRC for the purposes of her tax return amounted
    to �22,729.

4.    The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  concluded  that  the  SSHD  had  not
    discharged the burden of proof on her to show that the  first  claimant
    had used deception in  her  tax  returns.   The  Secretary  of  State's
    grounds contend that in so finding the judge erred  because  the  judge
    had  essentially  absolved  the  first  claimant  of  blame   for   the
    discrepancies which amounted to �10,000 by accepting her  account  that
    her accountant was to blame  for  the  discrepancies  in  her  declared
    income.  It was contended by the SSHD that  it  was  incorrect  of  the
    judge to find that the first claimant's accountant was to blame for the
    large discrepancies given that she was ultimately responsible  for  her
    own tax affairs, and it was stated that the first  claimant  could  not
    possibly be  ignorant  of  such  large  discrepancies  in  the  figures
    provided.

5.   I am grateful to  both  parties  for  their  submissions.   Both  quite
    properly made reference to the decision of the Upper  Tribunal  in  the
    case of R (on the application of Khan) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2018] UKUT  00384  wherein  Mr  Justice  Spencer  gave
    guidance on the proper approach to be taken  in  cases  concerned  with
    paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.

6.   I am not persuaded by the SSHD's grounds.  The principal  difficulty  I
    have with those grounds is that they make no challenge as such  to  the
    positive credibility findings of the judge.  At paragraph 18 the  judge
    stated that he was satisfied on the totality of the evidence  available
    that the first claimant and her husband were credible and were reliable
    sources of evidence.  At paragraph 30 the judge stated that he accepted
    all of the first claimant's explanations for the discrepancies  in  the
    amounts declared to HMRC, as opposed to  those  declared  to  UKVI,  as
    credible.  At paragraph 38 the judge concluded that the first  claimant
    in all the circumstances had provided a wholly credible explanation for
    the discrepancy between the income disclosed to HMRC on the  one  hand,
    and to UKVI [in the context of her  immigration  applications]  on  the
    other.  The judge stated "I am satisfied there was no  false  inflation
    of the  income  previously  stated  for  the  purposes  of  the  former
    immigration applications and that the  ten  year  period  is  well  and
    lawfully founded".

7.   Given the absence of any challenge to  the  very  positive  credibility
    findings of the judge, I see no force in the  SSHD's  contentions  that
    the judge wrongly absolved the claimant of blame for the  discrepancies
    and that the judge effectively accepted the  argument  that  accountant
    error could be treated as sufficient.  It is clear  from  the  guidance
    given in the Khan case  that  in  assessing  whether  the  tax  returns
    disclose  deceitful  or  dishonest  behaviour  as   opposed   to   mere
    carelessness a number of factors have to  be  considered.   It  is  not
    alleged by Mr Tarlow that the judge failed to consider all the relevant
    factors set out in the head note to the  case  of  Khan.   The  written
    grounds contend that at paragraph 36 the judge erroneously  treated  as
    decisive the fact that the HMRC did not raise  any  allegation  against
    the first claimant that she had  attempted  to  deceive  them.   It  is
    certainly correct that the judge treated this  lack  of  allegation  by
    HMRC as a relevant consideration;  however  there  is  nothing  in  the
    decision of Khan which identifies treating such a factor as a  relevant
    factor to be an error of law and I am not persuaded that the  judge  in
    this case gave it undue weight as a consideration.

8.   For the above reasons I conclude that the judge did not materially  err
    in law, and accordingly that the decision of the  judge  to  allow  the
    appeals of the three claimants against the refusal of long residence by
    the SSHD should be upheld.

No anonymity direction is made.
