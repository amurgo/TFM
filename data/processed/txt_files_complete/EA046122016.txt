For the Appellant:     Mr P. Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Following the canvassing of a number of matters at the  hearing  before
    this Tribunal Mr Dellar has indicated  in  writing  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State that in this individual  case,  and  with  no  wider
    concessions of principle, it is agreed that no  error  of  law  can  be
    demonstrated in the determination of the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Secretary of State's appeal is  dismissed.   The  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, allowing the appeal, therefore stands.

                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
