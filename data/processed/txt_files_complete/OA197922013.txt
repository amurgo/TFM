                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
                                 Ex tempore

 1. We refer to the parties as they were before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    Thus, this is an appeal from a determination of the First-tier Tribunal
    promulgated on 10 September 2014.  Permission to appeal was granted  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Digney on 22 October 2014.  He recounted when
    giving permission to appeal that the appellant, a citizen  of  Jamaica,
    had applied for leave to enter  this  country  as  an  adult  dependent
    relative.  That application was refused  and  an  appeal  against  that
    decision was allowed.

 2. The grounds of appeal argued that the judge did not deal properly  with
    paragraph E-ECDR.2.5(b) of the Immigration Rules  and  that  the  judge
    wrongly concluded that it did apply.  It was arguable,  so  said  Judge
    Digney, for the reasons given in the application, that  that  paragraph
    did not apply and that the judge erred in law  in  concluding  that  it
    did. And so Judge Digney granted permission to appeal.

 3. The Secretary of State's grounds  of  appeal  recited  that  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Simpson had materially erred  in  law  in  allowing  the
    appeal.  The grounds referred to paragraph 12 of the  determination  in
    which the judge had made findings  to  the  effect  that  the  relevant
    paragraph of the Rules was met on the basis that treatment  costs  were
    between J$250,000 and J$300,000 and that the appellant could pay for an
    operation in the United Kingdom because her sponsor had over �10,000 in
    savings.

 4. The grounds go on to say that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  did  not
    convert those figures  to  sterling  and  that  the  sums  in  question
    converted to less than �2,000.  As a result it was  contended  that  it
    was  entirely  obvious  on  any  assessment  of  the  facts  that   the
    requirements of the relevant paragraph were not met in this  case,  and
    that the learned judge had erred in law in finding that they had been.

 5. We take the facts from the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica born on  19  October  1929.   She
    applied for entry clearance to join her daughter,  Joyce  Tennyson,  in
    the United  Kingdom,  as  her  dependent  relative.  She  appealed  the
    decision of the Entry Clearance Officer, Kingston, made on 13 September
    2013, to refuse  her  leave  to  enter  under  paragraph  EC-DR.1.1  of
    Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal Judge noted that neither the overseas appellant
    nor the respondent was represented at the hearing and that both parties
    had consented to the case being dealt  with  on  the  papers.  She  was
    satisfied that she was entitled to proceed on that basis.

 7.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  referred  in  paragraph  3  of   the
    determination  to  the  reasons  for  the  Entry  Clearance   Officer's
    decision, as set out in a notice of immigration decision. In sum, those
    reasons were, firstly, that the appellant suffered from osteoarthritis,
    but no medical evidence regarding her  condition  had  been  submitted.
    Secondly, the appellant stated in Appendix 1 of  the  application  form
    that she was able to perform daily tasks such as washing  and  dressing
    albeit to a limited extent, and thirdly, the appellant stated that  she
    was a widow and that her husband had died  in  2013  but  she  had  not
    submitted  any  evidence  of  her   living   arrangements   or   family
    circumstances.

 8. The First-tier Tribunal Judge's determination  went  on  say  that  the
    respondent had asserted in the refusal  of  entry  clearance  that  the
    appellant had stated at Appendix 1 that she lived  with  her  daughter,
    Natalie Gibson, born in 1978, and her son, Wilbert Gibson born in 1975.
    However, it was clear from Appendix 1 that she  had  always  maintained
    that she had only one child,  that  is  Joyce  Tennyson,  the  sponsor.
    Moreover, given that the appellant was born in 1929 and her daughter in
    1947, it was highly unlikely in any event that  she  would  have  given
    birth to two  children  in  her  late  forties.   The  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's assertion about this was  clearly  erroneous.   It  was  most
    likely that the Entry Clearance Officer had confused another completely
    separate application with the application in question.

 9. The First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  went  on  to  say  that  it  was  most
    unfortunate that this error had  not  been  spotted  during  the  Entry
    Clearance  Manager's  review.   We  interpose  that  Mr  Nath  who  was
    representing the Entry Clearance Officer this afternoon  accepted  that
    this was a mistake in the decision.

10. The First-tier Tribunal then said that she had heard no oral  evidence.
    She listed the materials which she  had  considered.  They  included  a
    statement from Joyce Tennyson, her birth certificate, various financial
    documents, the appellant's birth certificate, a letter from the Nuttall
    Medical Centre, and a letter from the Railways Pension Scheme.

11. The First-tier Tribunal went on to direct itself  correctly  about  (1)
    the standard of proof (2) the point of time  at  which  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had to consider the relevant facts, that is, at  the  date  of
    the decision and (3) the facts which it  was  permitted  to  take  into
    account, that is, the facts that were in existence at the time  of  the
    decision.  The First-tier Tribunal then set out, at paragraphs 7 and  8
    of its determination, the  relevant  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  We do not need to repeat those here.

12. The key requirements which  were  potentially  controversial  were  the
    requirements of E-ECDR.2.4 and E-ECDR.2.5.  The first of those is  that
    the applicant "... must as a  result  of  age,  illness  or  disability
    require long-term personal care to perform everyday tasks".  The second
    is that the applicant "... must be unable even with the  practical  and
    financial help of the sponsor, to obtain the required level of care  in
    the country where they are living because (a) it is not  available  and
    there is no person in that country who can provide it; or (b) it is not
    affordable".

13. The First-tier Tribunal observed that it was not in  dispute  that  the
    appellant was an 84 year-old widow.  The Tribunal accepted as  reliable
    the information in her application and in the grounds  of  appeal  that
    she had only one child, that is the sponsor, who is a  British  citizen
    and resident in London.  The First-tier Tribunal went on to make clear,
    for the avoidance of doubt, its finding that the appellant did not have
    any other  children,  whether  named  Natalie  or  Wilbert  Gibson,  or
    otherwise.  In those circumstances the Tribunal was  satisfied  on  the
    balance of probabilities that in practical terms the appellant  had  no
    close relatives in Jamaica  to  whom  she  could  turn  for  practical,
    emotional or financial support in the long term.

14. The Tribunal noted that the appellant received three pensions and  what
    her average yearly net income was.  However,  the  Tribunal  said,  the
    fact that the appellant had her own financial resources was  irrelevant
    for these purposes.  It was not a requirement of paragraphs  E-ECDR.2.1
    to 3.2 that she be  wholly  or  mainly  financially  dependent  on  her
    sponsor.

15. What was required, the Tribunal said, was that she must as a result  of
    age, illness, or disability require long-term personal care to  perform
    everyday tasks.  As to that, the Tribunal said, there was a report from
    Dr Ian Neil, a consultant orthopaedic and spinal surgeon, in  which  he
    said that the appellant was  suffering  from  (a)  lumbar  spondylosis,
    spinal stenosis and senile osteoporosis and (2)  severe  osteoarthritis
    of the right hip and ankylosis causing right leg shortening and  should
    consider  a  right  total  hip  replacement.    She   also   had   mild
    osteoarthritis of the left hip.

16. The Tribunal's conclusion in the light of that medical evidence was  as
    follows: "In my view these conditions, together with her advanced  age,
    almost certainly result in a  need  for  long-term  personal  care  and
    practical and emotional support."

17. The Tribunal  next  considered  whether  such  care  was  available  in
    Jamaica. It noted that the appellant had no close relatives in  Jamaica
    to whom she could turn for  emotional  or  physical  support  and  that
    although it might be possible to approach friends for short-term  care,
    the appellant required a total hip  replacement  and  ongoing  reliable
    domestic help, neither of which was readily available in Jamaica.   The
    Tribunal noted that in  2012  only  three  hospitals  in  Jamaica,  the
    Cornwall Regional Hospital, the University Hospital of the West Indies,
    and Kingston Public Hospital provided such treatment, the waiting  time
    for which was more than eighteen months, and the cost of the  implants,
    that does not presumably include the cost of the operation or  hospital
    care, was between J$250,000 and J$350,000.

18. The Tribunal was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that such an
    operation in the United Kingdom would not result in reliance on  public
    funds as the appellant had over �10,000 of  savings  in  her  Santander
    account.  The Tribunal said that the sponsor's ability to maintain  and
    accommodate her mother in London without recourse to public  funds  was
    not challenged and in  any,  event,  having  seen  the  sponsor's  bank
    statements and her own pension payments the Tribunal was  satisfied  on
    the balance of probabilities that the  appellant  could  and  would  be
    maintained and accommodated adequately in the  United  Kingdom  without
    recourse to public funds.  Given that the sponsor was a British citizen
    the appellant should be granted indefinite leave to remain  (we  assume
    she meant indefinite leave  to  enter)  provided  of  course  that  the
    sponsor  was  prepared  to  provide  the  requisite   undertaking   and
    guarantee.

19. In the event the appeal was allowed.

20. In those circumstances  the  first  question  for  us  is  whether  the
    Tribunal erred in law.  Mr O'Callaghan submits that the Tribunal can be
    taken to have been aware of the conversion rate of Jamaican dollars  to
    pounds sterling and the fact that  that  conversion  is  not  expressly
    carried out in the determination does not indicate  that  the  Tribunal
    erred in law.

21. Mr Nath for the Entry  Clearance  Officer  submits  that  the  Tribunal
    should have spelled out this reasoning clearly and its failure to do so
    shows that it did err in law.

22. In our judgment the focus on the operation alone  is  misplaced.   What
    the Tribunal  was  doing  was  to  assess  in  the  round  whether  the
    requirements of the relevant paragraph of the Rules were  met  or  not.
    The need for the operation was only one part of that  assessment.   The
    conclusions of the Tribunal were first, that the conditions which  were
    noted in the medical report together with the appellant's advanced age,
    and what is recorded on the application form, almost certainly resulted
    in the need for long term  personal  care,  including  in  relation  to
    performing everyday tasks, as well as practical and emotional  support;
    and second, that those would not be  available  in  the  long  term  in
    Jamaica. As regards the phrase "everyday tasks", it  is  apparent  from
    paragraphs 11 and 12 together that the First-tier  judge  did  conclude
    that the appellant required long terms personal care to  perform  those
    tasks. It seems to us on the facts that those were conclusions to which
    the Tribunal was entitled to come and they disclose no error of law.

23. Accordingly, we are not satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal made any
    error of law, and the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow  the
    appeal therefore stands.

24. The Secretary of State's appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  therefore
    dismissed.
