Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr. R. Parkin of Counsel, instructed by Barnes
                    Harrild & Dyer Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr. S. Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Buckwell, promulgated on 19 September 2018, in which  he
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's  decision  to
    refuse a grant of asylum.

 2. As this is an asylum appeal I make an anonymity direction.

 3. Permission to appeal was granted as follows:

         "The first ground was arguable.  The Appellant  relied  on  country
         guidance set out  in  AAH  Iraq  CG  [2018]  UKUT  00212  and  made
         submissions based upon his personal circumstances  on  return.   It
         appeared to be accepted by the Judge that the  Appellant  would  be
         returning without any family support.  In concluding that,  despite
         that, it would not be unduly harsh for the Appellant, reliance  was
         placed on him being a non-disabled adult, who had been able to make
         his way to the UK.  There was  no  apparent  consideration  of  the
         other relevant factors highlighted in AAH (and  in  submissions  at
         [58]), regarding  accommodation  and  maintenance.   If  they  were
         considered, there was no explanation of how they had  been  weighed
         by the Judge."

 4. At the hearing, it was accepted by Mr. Walker that the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal involved the making of a  material  error  of  law,
    with reference to paragraph [64].

 5.  Taking  into  account  this  concession,  and  having  considered  the
    decision, I set the decision aside to be remade.  I  heard  submissions
    on the remaking.

Error of law

 6. The decision states at [64]:

         "The question arises as to whether the Appellant would therefore be
         able to relocate to the IKR and whether that requirement  would  be
         unduly harsh.  The Appellant emphasised in some detail that he  has
         no immediate family members, extended family members or friends who
         could assist him on return.  However the Appellant is an adult  who
         is intelligent and who was able to make his way  to  this  country,
         even if assisted by an agent, over a prolonged timescale.  I do not
         find that the Appellant is under any disability and he is therefore
         an adult who could re-establish himself within the IKR.  In all the
         circumstances I do not find that it would be unduly harsh to expect
         the Appellant to return to the IKR."

 7. This is the full extent of the  Judge's  consideration  of  whether  it
    would be unduly harsh for the Appellant to relocate to the IKR.  I find
    that  inadequate  reasons  are  given,  especially  given  the  country
    guidance case of AAH.  The case is referred to at [58] of the  decision
    when the Judge summarises the submissions made by Mr.  Parkin.   It  is
    apparent that Mr. Parkin referred to the fact that the Appellant had no
    family in the IKR, that the refugee camps were closed  to  new  people,
    and the problems of renting accommodation.  He  also  referred  to  the
    problems securing employment.  He  had  submitted  in  conclusion  that
    there  would  be  significant  difficulties  for   the   Appellant   on
    relocation.

 8. None of these issues are addressed by the Judge at [64].  There  is  no
    reference to the factors set out in the headnote to AAH.  I  find  that
    there is inadequate reasoning given  as  to  why  the  Appellant  could
    return to the IKR and why it would not be unduly harsh.





Remaking

 9. It was agreed by both parties, before they made their submissions, that
    the issue before me was whether it  was  unduly  harsh  to  expect  the
    Appellant, who has no family support, to return to  the  IKR.   It  was
    accepted by Mr. Parkin, as found in the First-tier Tribunal,  that  the
    Appellant could physically travel from Baghdad to the IKR given that he
    had a CSID.  The issue is what the position would be for the  Appellant
    once he arrived in the IKR, given that he has no family support.

10. I have carefully considered the case of AAH.  Paragraphs [7] to [10] of
    the headnote state:

         "7.  Whether P would be at particular risk of ill-treatment  during
             the security screening process must be assessed on a  case-by-
             case basis. Additional factors that may increase risk include:
             (i) coming from a family with a known association  with  ISIL,
             (ii) coming from an area associated with ISIL and (iii)  being
             a single male of fighting age. P  is  likely  to  be  able  to
             evidence the fact of recent arrival from the UK,  which  would
             dispel any suggestion of having  arrived  directly  from  ISIL
             territory.

         8.   If P has family members living in the IKR cultural norms would
             require that family to accommodate P. In such circumstances  P
             would, in general, have sufficient assistance from the  family
             so as to lead a 'relatively normal life', which would  not  be
             unduly harsh. It is nevertheless important for decision-makers
             to determine  the  extent  of  any  assistance  likely  to  be
             provided by P's family on a case by case basis.

         9.   For those without the assistance of  family  in  the  IKR  the
             accommodation options are limited:

                   i) Absent special circumstances  it  is  not  reasonably
                      likely that P will be able to gain access to  one  of
                      the refugee camps in the IKR; these camps are already
                      extremely overcrowded and are  closed  to  newcomers.
                      64% of IDPs are accommodated in private settings with
                      the vast majority living with family members;

                  ii) If P cannot live with a family member, apartments  in
                      a modern block in a new neighbourhood  are  available
                      for rent at a cost  of  between  $300  and  $400  per
                      month;

                 iii) P could resort to a 'critical  shelter  arrangement',
                      living  in  an  unfinished  or  abandoned  structure,
                      makeshift shelter, tent, mosque, church or  squatting
                      in a government building.  It would be  unduly  harsh
                      to require P to relocate to the IKR if P will live in
                      a critical housing shelter without  access  to  basic
                      necessities such as food, clean water and clothing;

                  iv) In considering whether P  would  be  able  to  access
                      basic necessities, account must be taken of the  fact
                      that failed asylum seekers are entitled to apply  for
                      a grant under the  Voluntary  Returns  Scheme,  which
                      could give P access to  ï¿½1500.  Consideration  should
                      also be given  to  whether  P  can  obtain  financial
                      support from other sources such  as  (a)  employment,
                      (b)  remittances  from  relatives  abroad,  (c)   the
                      availability of ad hoc charity or by  being  able  to
                      access PDS rations.

         10.  Whether P is able to secure employment must be assessed  on  a
             case-by-case basis taking the following matters into account:

                   i) Gender. Lone women are very unlikely to  be  able  to
                      secure legitimate employment;

                  ii) The unemployment rate for Iraqi IDPs  living  in  the
                      IKR is 70%;

                 iii) P cannot work without a CSID;

                  iv) Patronage  and  nepotism  continue  to  be  important
                      factors  in  securing  employment.  A  returnee  with
                      family  connections  to  the  region  will   have   a
                      significant advantage in that he would ordinarily  be
                      able  to   call   upon   those   contacts   to   make
                      introductions to prospective employers and  to  vouch
                      for him;

                   v) Skills, education and experience.  Unskilled  workers
                      are at the greatest disadvantage, with the decline in
                      the construction  industry  reducing  the  number  of
                      labouring jobs available;

                  vi) If P is from an area with a marked  association  with
                      ISIL, that may deter prospective employers."

11. Going through these paragraphs in turn as they apply to the  Appellant,
    I find that the Appellant would  be  returning  as  a  single  male  of
    fighting age (7(iii)).  However, as accepted by Mr. Parkin, given  that
    he would have arrived from the United Kingdom, this  would  dispel  any
    suggestion of having arrived from ISIL territory.

12. With reference to paragraph 8 of the headnote,  the  circumstances  set
    out there for an individual returning to family members in the  IKR  do
    not  apply  to  the  Appellant.   It  is  in  paragraph  9  where   the
    difficulties for those who do not have the assistance of family in  the
    IKR are set out.  In  his  submissions  Mr.  Walker  referred  only  to
    paragraph 9(iv) and the Voluntary Returns Scheme grant.

13. Going through the factors set out in  paragraph  9,  I  find  that  the
    Appellant would be unlikely to find accommodation in a refugee camp  in
    the IKR (9(i)).  In relation to paragraph 9(ii) there  is  no  evidence
    before me that the Appellant would be able to afford between US$300 and
    US$400 per month from his own resources in order to rent accommodation,
    and it was not submitted by Mr. Walker that he would  be  able  to  do.
    Paragraph 9(iii), which sets out the  third  option  of  accommodation,
    would be to squat in e.g. an abandoned  building  or  tent.   Paragraph
    9(iii) makes it clear that it  would  be  unduly  harsh  to  expect  an
    individual to relocate to the IKR if  he  would  live  in  a  "critical
    housing shelter" without access to basic necessities.

14. Mr. Parkin accepted that  the  Appellant  could  access  the  Voluntary
    Returns Scheme grant, but queried what would happen when that money ran
    out.  He submitted that  the  Appellant  would  not  be  able  to  find
    employment without patronage and family support.

15. The issues regarding the ability of an individual to secure  employment
    are set out at paragraph 10 of the headnote.  Mr. Parkin submitted that
    the factors which were relevant were those  set  out  at  10(ii),  that
    there was 70% unemployment, 10(iv), that patronage  and  nepotism  were
    still important and that there was an advantage for those  with  family
    connections, and 10(v)  that  skills,  education  and  experience  were
    important, and it was unskilled workers who were suffering as there was
    a lack of employment.

16. I find that, were the Appellant to be able to access  accommodation  by
    renting, he would need to find between US$300 and US$400 per month.  He
    would also need money for basic necessities such as food.  There was no
    indication that there would  be  remittances  for  the  Appellant  from
    family members abroad, and Mr. Walker did not suggest that there  would
    be. The third option of ad hoc charity would not  provide  a  permanent
    source of income.  There was no submission  made  by  Mr.  Walker  that
    there would be any particular availability of charity or rations  which
    would enable the Appellant to support himself in the long term.

17. Therefore, while a Voluntary Returns  Scheme  grant  may  cover  a  few
    months of the basic cost of living, the Appellant would  then  need  to
    find employment to cover these costs.  I find that unemployment runs at
    70% (10(ii)).  The Appellant would  not  have  any  family  support  or
    patronage to enable him to find employment (10(iv)).  At his  screening
    interview the Appellant said that he had been educated only to  primary
    school level (2.6).  He said at his asylum interview that he had been a
    welder (Q52), and that he had worked doing a car  wash  job  in  Turkey
    (Q87).   Paragraph  10(v)   refers   specifically   to   the   greatest
    disadvantage being for unskilled workers, especially "with the  decline
    in the construction industry reducing  the  number  of  labouring  jobs
    available".

18. No evidence was provided to suggest that the Appellant would  not  fall
    within the general position set out in the headnote to  AAH,  which  is
    that there are significant difficulties for those  people  who  do  not
    have family support.   Those  difficulties  inevitably  result  in  the
    conditions being unduly harsh for such persons.  The  exceptions  which
    may take an individual out of  the  unduly  harsh  category,  those  of
    having ample resources, family connections or secure accommodation,  do
    not apply to the Appellant.  It was accepted by  Mr.  Walker  that  the
    only part of AAH which applied to the Appellant was paragraph 9(iv)  of
    the headnote, given that he had no family.  But a grant is not  a  long
    term solution.

19. Taking all of this into account, I find that the Appellant, given  that
    he has no family support, and is not a professional or skilled  worker,
    would be unlikely to find employment in the IKR so that, once any funds
    from the Voluntary Returns Scheme grant ran out, he would not  be  able
    to afford the basic necessities or  accommodation.   I  therefore  find
    that it would be unduly harsh to expect the Appellant to return to  the
    IKR.





Notice of Decision

20. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involves  the  making  of  a
    material error of law and I set the decision aside.

21. I remake  the  decision  allowing  the  Appellant's  appeal  on  asylum
    grounds.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
