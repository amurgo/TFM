Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms L Mair, Counsel instructed on a direct access
                    basis
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of India who  were  born  on  the  (i)  2nd
    February 1981, (ii) 10th August 1959, (iii) 26th January 2005, and (iv)
    6th July 2007. The first and second appellants  are  respectively  wife
    and husband, and the third and fourth appellants are their children. As
    anonymity was not directed in the First-tier Tribunal, I consider  that
    there is no purpose in ordering it now.


 2. The appellants appeal with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Henderson, who dismissed their appeals against  the
    respondent's decision to refuse the application of the first  appellant
    for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant  and  to  refuse
    the applications of the other appellants for leave  to  remain  as  her
    dependents. Unless the context otherwise admits, all further  reference
    to "the appellant" is to the first appellant.


 3. The  respondent  refused  the  appellant's  application,  on  the  21st
    February 2014, under paragraph 39B(c) of the  Immigration  Rules.  This
    reads as follows:


    (c)   If  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  or  Secretary  of  State  has
         reasonable cause to doubt the genuineness of any document submitted
         by an applicant which is, or which  purports  to  be,  a  specified
         document under these Rules, and having taken  reasonable  steps  to
         verify the document is unable to verify that  it  is  genuine,  the
         document will be discounted for the purposes of this application.

 4. The critical passage from the respondent's  letter  to  the  appellant,
    explaining the reasons why her application had been refused,  reads  as
    follows:


         You have claimed 25 points for  access  to  funds  under  paragraph
         245DD(b) and Appendix A of the Immigration Rules. You  have  stated
         that you have access to funds of ï¿½50,000 being  made  available  to
         you by Mr Israr Ul Haq.

         As evidence of this you have provided:

               1. a letter from Habib Bank dated 18 December 2013;

               2. a declaration from Israr Ul Haq;

               3. a letter from Mr Syed Raza Mehdi of United Solicitors

         However, the letter from Habib Bank supplied to support your  claim
         for points against access to funds  has  been  discounted  for  the
         purpose of this application, in line with paragraph 39B(c)  of  the
         Immigration Rules, as  having  taken  all  reasonable  attempts  to
         verify the documentation with Habib Bank we have  been  u  able  to
         verify that it is genuine.

 5. As evidence  that  she  had  "taken  reasonable  steps  to  verify  the
    document", the respondent relied upon an email that  her  official  had
    sent to the relevant branch of the Habib  Bank,  on  the  4th  February
    2014, asking it to verify the authenticity of the  letter  in  question
    and to confirm whether it had issued it. There had  been  no  reply  to
    this email by the date of the decision.





 6. At paragraph 21 of her determination,  the  judge  commented  upon  the
    respondent's evidence as follows:


         The evidence of reasonable steps therefore consists of  one  email.
         There is no written evidence regarding the two  telephone  chasers.
         There is no evidence of  further  emails  to  follow  the  lack  of
         response. The  Respondent's  representative  made  reference  to  a
         further email in August but this was not provided and I am  unclear
         as to why this was not in the Respondent's  bundle.  I  have  dealt
         with many applications made from Pakistan which are also subject to
         verification with the Habib Bank and in those applications there is
         clear documentation to show this. However, the  Respondent  is  not
         stating  that  the  letter  is  false  but  simply  that  there  is
         inconclusive  evidence  regarding  the  letter  and  therefore  the
         funding after reasonable steps have been taken  to  make  enquiries
         about the letter.

 7. The judge thereafter noted that the appellant had testified  to  having
    subsequently telephoned Mr Ul Haq. However, he had "effectively  washed
    his hands of the situation by stating that he had done as  much  as  he
    could in providing a letter from his bank". Thereafter,  the  appellant
    had been unable to contact him any further. The  judge  concluded  from
    this that "the level of funds being offered is not  proportionate  with
    the level of co-operation now being denied". This  in  her  view  added
    "weight to the doubts concerning the specified  document  produced  and
    lack of verification" [paragraph 22]. Finally, the judge concluded that
    the respondent had taken reasonable  steps  to  verify  the  letter  in
    question, and that there was "insufficient evidence" to show that  this
    document could be relied upon as evidence that the appellant had access
    to the funds that were necessary in order for her  to  succeed  in  her
    application.


 8. There are four grounds of appeal  against  Judge  Henderson's  decision
    which, when placed in a logical order, may be summarised as follows:


      i) the respondent had failed to show "reasonable cause"  for  doubting
         the genuineness of the document;

     ii) the tenor of the judge's remarks concerning  her  the  respondent's
         efforts to verify the document ran counter to her  conclusion  that
         these amounted to "reasonable steps" to do so;

    iii) by asserting that there was "insufficient evidence"  to  show  that
         the letter could be relied upon as evidence of access to funds, the
         judge had wrongly placed the burden of proof upon the appellant;

     iv) Section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
         prohibited the judge from having regard to the sponsor's  testimony
         concerning her subsequent enquiries of Mr Ul Haq in relation to his
         failure to respond to the respondent's email  and  his  refusal  to
         provide her with any further assistance in the matter.

 9. The second ground  clearly  has  merit  in  view  of  the  contents  of
    paragraph 21 of the judge's determination, cited in full at paragraph 6
    (above). The third  ground  also  has  merit,  albeit  for  a  slightly
    different reason from that which  is  pleaded.  Whilst  the  underlying
    purpose of paragraph 39B(c) is to ensure that unreliable documents  are
    excluded  from  consideration  under   the   Immigration   Rules,   the
    reliability or otherwise of the document in question is  not  an  issue
    which is directly engaged by it.  Assuming  that  the  stage  has  been
    reached where it is in fact appropriate  for  the  respondent  to  take
    "reasonable steps" to verify the authenticity of a document, a  finding
    that such steps have been taken will require the Tribunal  to  discount
    the questioned document when making its assessment of the  application.
    The reliability or otherwise of the document will thus  be  immaterial,
    and the question of who  bears  the  burden  of  proving  it  does  not
    therefore arise for consideration. The fourth ground  is  misconceived.
    This is because Section 85A(4) does not provide an absolute bar to  the
    admission of post-application evidence in 'points-based system'  cases.
    Rather, the submission of evidence with the application is but  one  of
    four  alternative  conditions  for  admissibility.  Two  of  the   four
    alternative conditions for  admissibility  were  arguably  met  in  the
    present case; namely, that the  evidence  was  being  "adduced  by  the
    appellant" in order "to prove that a document is genuine or valid",  or
    is being adduced "in connection with the Secretary of State's  reliance
    on discretion under immigration rules" [Section 84A(4)(c) and (d)].


10. However, the merits of  the  second,  third,  and  fourth  grounds  are
    ultimately immaterial to the outcome of this appeal.  This  is  because
    the requirement for "reasonable cause" to doubt the  genuineness  of  a
    document is a precedent  condition  to  it  being  discounted  for  the
    purposes of the application, and neither the respondent nor  the  judge
    appears to have addressed their  mind  to  this  issue.  It  would  not
    require  much  to  satisfy  the  requirement  for  "reasonable  cause".
    Evidence that gives grounds  for  reasonable  suspicion  will  suffice.
    There must however be some evidence before the Tribunal that is capable
    of justifying the respondent's questioning of the document;  otherwise,
    as Ms Mairs pointed out, it would leave it open  to  the  Secretary  of
    State or Entry Clearance Officer to question an  applicant's  documents
    upon an entirely capricious basis. In this case, there was no  evidence
    at all to show that the respondent had "reasonable cause"  to  question
    the document before she made her enquiries of the institutions that had
    purportedly issued it. The lack of response to those enquires was  thus
    incapable of informing the issue of prior "reasonable  cause".  As  the
    absence of access  to  funds  was  the  sole  basis  for  refusing  the
    application, it follows that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to
    dismiss the appeal must be set aside and substituted by a  decision  to
    allow the appeal on the ground that the decision is not  in  accordance
    with immigration rules.
