Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms A Benfield, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. The appellant in this  case  is  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  who
       appeals with the permission of the First-tier  Tribunal  against  the
       decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Fletcher-Hill  to  allow
       the appeal of Mr Kulow, a Somali national born on  26  October  1983,
       against a decision dated  16  April  2013  refusing  Mr  Kulow  entry
       clearance in order to join his wife in the UK. The sponsor is Ms Foos
       Hidigow Hassan, a British citizen born on 1 January 1969. The  couple
       married in Somalia on 10  March  2010  and  have  a  child  together:
       Mohamed Mukhtaar Mohamed, born on 15 August 2011 in London.


    2. It is more convenient to refer to the parties as they were before the
       First-tier Tribunal. From now on I shall refer to Mr  Kulow  as  "the
       appellant" and to the Entry Clearance Officer as "the respondent".


    3. I was not asked and saw no reason to make an anonymity direction.


    4. The respondent refused the appellant entry  clearance  as  a  partner
       under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules on 16 April 2013 following
       an application made on 18 March 2013. The reasons for refusal can  be
       summarised as follows:


       i) The sponsor had failed, as requested,  to  provide  a  sponsorship
           undertaking (S-EC.2.4);
       ii)    The ECO was not satisfied the couple had met (E-ECP.2.5);
       iii)   The ECO was not satisfied the couple were  in  a  genuine  and
           subsisting  relationship  and  that  they   intended   to   live
           permanently in the UK (E-ECP.2.6 and 2.10);
       iv)    The ECO was not satisfied the sponsor was divorced  such  that
           the marriage to the appellant was valid (E-ECP.2.7);
       v) The financial requirements were not met  because  the  appellant's
           potential employment could not be taken  into  account  and  the
           sponsor's income was derived from welfare benefits (E-ECP.3.1).


    5. Judge Fletcher-Hill heard oral evidence from the  sponsor,  whom  she
       found to be a completely credible witness. She accepted  the  sponsor
       was present at the marriage on 10 March 2010,  which  took  place  in
       Somalia. Since then she had visited the  appellant  five  times.  She
       accepted the couple had a son. She accepted the marriage was  genuine
       and subsisting. The presenting officer submitted the English language
       test and financial requirements of the rules were not met and counsel
       for the appellant conceded that was correct. The focus  of  the  case
       became whether the decision breached article 8 outside the rules. The
       judge found it did. She noted the sponsor and her son  were  British.
       She noted the financial requirements of the rules were  not  met  but
       noted the appellant  was  willing  to  work  and  that  an  offer  of
       employment had been made and may still be available. She concluded as
       follows:


           "54. I find that after applying the requirements  of  the  rules
           there may be arguably good grounds for  granting  leave  outside
           the rules if there are compelling circumstances. I find that  in
           this case  the  appellant's  wife  and  their  son  are  British
           citizens and that they live together with other children of  the
           sponsor and half siblings of the appellant's son,  all  of  whom
           are also British citizens. I find that it is unjustifiably harsh
           to expect the appellant's British  citizen  wife  and  child  to
           continue to travel to Somalia or Egypt to visit him and that the
           sponsor has other minor children and responsibilities  and  work
           in the UK.


           55. I find that it is in the best interests of  the  appellant's
           son to be able to live with both his parents in  a  family  unit
           and that his mother is not in a position to relocate  to  reside
           with the appellant in Somalia or elsewhere.


           56. I find  the  appellant  has  now  passed  an  ESOL  level  1
           certificate, as he did so in July 2013, and that as long ago  as
           2005 he had  passed  a  two-year  intensive  English  course  in
           Somalia. Although the approved English language certificate  was
           only obtained after the date of decision, it had  been  obtained
           prior to the date of the appeal and the ECM review  and  clearly
           indicates the appellant continues to have satisfactory knowledge
           of English to meet the requirements of the rules.


           57. Considering  the  financial  requirements  set  out  in  the
           reasons for refusal, I find  that  the  sponsor's  position  has
           changed since the date of decision and  she  has  now  commenced
           part-time work, although the amount that  she  earns  would  not
           enable the appellant to meet the financial requirements  of  the
           immigration rules.


           58. I  therefore  find  that  the  Decision  of  the  Respondent
           appealed  against  is  in  accordance  with  the  law  and   the
           applicable immigration rules.


           59. In relation  to  article  8  ECHR  I  find  that  there  are
           compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised  under  the
           rules which make the exclusion of  the  appellant  unjustifiably
           harsh in the particular circumstances of this case."


    6. In recording the submissions made by counsel for the  appellant,  the
       judge stated as follows:


           "45. The recent cases of  Gulshan  and  MM  were  relied  on  in
           relation to the correct approach to  article  8  under  the  new
           rules and that the case of MM commented that the  prevention  of
           having any regard to the future earnings of the spouse  in  such
           cases is harsh and can prevent the exercise of family life by  a
           couple and that the new income threshold is intrusive and higher
           than the minimum wage level and onerous and could constitute  an
           unjustified and disproportionate interference with  the  ability
           of spouses to live together.


           46. It was submitted that although this case may fail under  the
           immigration rules the cases of Gulshan and MM are relied on.  It
           was submitted that the  sponsor  is  a  UK  citizen  as  is  the
           couple's son and that there is evidence of  the  possibility  of
           work for the appellant on arrival in the UK which  would  enable
           him to generate his own  income  from  the  job  offer.  It  was
           submitted that the offer is said to still be available  and  was
           certainly available at the date of the decision  but  cannot  be
           taken account of under the immigration rules.  The  offer  would
           generate �650 per month for the appellant (�150 per  week).  The
           sponsor and her children are already supported in terms of their
           maintenance and  accommodation  and  the  income  support  level
           required for an adult is �71 per week which would mean  that  if
           admitted to the UK to live with his family the  appellant  would
           not become an additional burden on State funds if the job  offer
           is available and taken up."


    7. The respondent sought permission  to  appeal,  arguing  the  decision
       contained a material misdirection of law. The lengthy grounds can  be
       summarised as follows. The case of Gulshan [2013]  UKUT  00640  (IAC)
       made it clear that the article 8 assessment shall only be carried out
       where there are compelling circumstances not recognised by the  rules
       and the Tribunal had not identified such compelling circumstances and
       had failed to  refer  to  the  case.  The  Tribunal's  findings  were
       therefore unsustainable. The Secretary of State was entitled to set a
       minimum income threshold with the aim  of  ensuring  that  those  who
       choose to establish their family life  in  the  UK  should  have  the
       financial ability to support themselves such that the migrant partner
       would not become a burden on the taxpayer  and  was  better  able  to
       integrate into British  society.  The  entry  clearance  officer  had
       applied the law as it stood. The  appellant  and  the  sponsor  could
       continue their family life together in Somalia and article  8  should
       not be used to circumvent the rules. There was  no  analysis  by  the
       judge as to why the appellant could not submit a further application.
       It was in the best interests of the sponsor's British child to remain
       with his parents. The judge had given significance to  the  fact  the
       appellant claimed to have a job offer in the UK but, in  the  absence
       of any documentary evidence to demonstrate this, it  was  implausible
       that a job offer from  2012  was  still  open.  The  Tribunal  placed
       reliance on MM and the grounds submitted -  presciently  -  that  the
       case was wrongly decided.


    8. I heard submissions from  the  representatives  on  the  question  of
       whether the judge had made a material error of law.  Mr  Avery  noted
       paragraphs 45 and 46 of the judge's decision and pointed out that the
       submissions were based on the Administrative Court decision of  Blake
       J, which had in substance been overturned by the Court of  Appeal  in
       MM (Lebanon) & Ors, R (on the application of) v SSHD [2014] EWCA  Civ
       985. The fundamental problem with the judge's decision was  that  the
       article 8 consideration was particularly unstructured and it did  not
       address all the relevant factors.  The  judge  commented  on  several
       things favouring the appellant but made no reference  to  the  public
       interest enshrined in the rules.  The  judge  had  not  set  out  the
       Secretary of State's position at all. Secondly, in paragraphs 56  and
       57, the judge had considered post-decision evidence relating  to  the
       English language test and the  sponsor's  income.  Neither  of  these
       matters were foreseeable as at the date  of  decision.  Thirdly,  the
       judge failed to take into account, when looking at the best interests
       of the children, that the appellant had a child in Somalia  as  well,
       who would lose contact with his father if the appellant came  to  the
       UK. Finally, the judge had  not  really  considered  whether  it  was
       justifiable to split the family.


    9. In reply, Ms Benfield argued there was no material error  of  law  in
       the judge's decision  and  the  respondent's  arguments  were  simply
       disagreement with her findings. She pointed out  that  the  Court  of
       Appeal had not handed down its judgement when the First-tier Tribunal
       heard the appeal. The  judge  did  not  err  by  applying  Blake  J's
       decision. The judge had also applied the law as it stood at that time
       in relation to the Gulshan point. It was clear from paragraph  54  of
       the decision that the judge considered that British citizenship was a
       compelling factor in the case and it was open to the  judge  to  make
       this finding.  She  took  proper  account  of  all  the  factors  and
       concluded there were compelling  circumstances.  The  judge  had  not
       placed inappropriate reliance on MM. While she had referred to it, it
       was not a material factor in her determination. It was appropriate to
       take into account the sponsor's recent earnings. It would  have  been
       wrong to consider the prospect of  family  life  being  continued  in
       Somalia because of the principles  set  out  in  the  cases  of  Ruiz
       Zambrano (C-34/09) and Sanade and others (British children - Zambrano
       - Dereci) [2012] UKUT 00048 (IAC). It was also  appropriate  for  the
       judge to take into account the fact  the  appellant  had  passed  the
       English language test. It  was  unduly  speculative  to  suggest  the
       appellant could make a further application. She was the single mother
       of seven children and it was extremely unlikely she would  ever  meet
       the financial requirements of the rules.


   10. Mr Avery repeated that it was not clear what the  judge  had  weighed
       against the factors which he found favoured the appellant.


   11. I reserved my decision as to whether the judge made a material  error
       of law in her decision.


  Error of law
   12. The judge  made  material  errors  in  her  assessment.  Perhaps  the
       clearest error is shown at paragraphs 53, 56 and 57 where the  judge,
       in conducting the proportionality balancing  exercise,  clearly  took
       into  account  post-decision  evidence  relating  to  the   sponsor's
       earnings and the fact the appellant had passed the  English  language
       test. In respect of the latter, I acknowledge  that  he  appeared  to
       have done so by the time the  entry  clearance  manager  conducted  a
       review of the decision. However, in respect of the financial position
       the judge recorded that the sponsor  had  started  working  part-time
       cleaning shops and offices in  the  Westfield  shopping  centre  (see
       paragraph 24). There was nothing in the evidence to suggest that  the
       situation was foreseeable as at the date of decision, which was  more
       than a year prior to the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.


   13. Section 85A(2) of the 2002 Act provides that the First-tier  Tribunal
       can only consider the circumstances appertaining at the time  of  the
       decision  to  refuse,  as  interpreted  in  DR  (ECO:   Post-decision
       evidence) Morocco [2005] UKIAT 00038 Starred. This applies equally to
       the human rights ground of appeal (AS (Somalia) (FC)  and  another  v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] UKHL 32). The judge
       plainly erred in this respect.


   14. I also agree with Mr Avery's broader point regarding the  conduct  of
       the proportionality balancing exercise. He did not rely expressly  on
       the point taken in the grounds of appeal in relation to  Gulshan,  no
       doubt because it has since been clarified that there is no  threshold
       test (see, for example, R (on the application of Esther Ebun  Oludoyi
       & Ors) v SSHD (Article 8 - MM (Lebanon) and Nagre)  IJR  [2014]  UKUT
       00539 (IAC)). The written grounds are also  incorrect  in  suggesting
       the judge did not go through the  process  of  identifying  what  she
       considered  to  be  compelling  circumstances.  However,  nowhere  in
       paragraphs 48 to 59 does the judge make any reference to  the  public
       interest in ensuring that the rules are complied with. Accordingly, I
       find the judge did not in effect conduct a balancing exercise at  all
       but simply gave reasons for finding in favour of the appellant.


   15. To the extent the judge relied on the dicta of Blake J, as  suggested
       by the references to the case of MM in paragraphs 45 and  46,  whilst
       the judge cannot be criticised for failing to apply the  judgment  of
       the Court of Appeal, which had  not  yet  been  handed  down,  it  is
       nonetheless clear that the principles  taken  from  the  judgment  of
       Blake J were not good law and therefore the First-tier Tribunal erred
       by relying on them.


   16. I therefore set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.


  Decision substituted
   17. The parties were in agreement that, in the event I found they judge's
       decision contained a material error  of  law,  I  should  proceed  to
       remake the decision myself. Such a  course  was  anticipated  in  the
       directions to the parties and both representatives were  prepared  to
       proceed  in  that  manner.  Neither  representative  thought  it  was
       necessary to hear further evidence and there was no reason to disturb
       the factual findings made by the First-tier Tribunal.


   18. I have had regard to the evidence filed by the parties in the  First-
       tier Tribunal.


   19. Ms Benfield said it was clear that the sponsor has  been  in  the  UK
       since 1990 and  is  British.  She  has  six  children  from  previous
       marriages and a seventh child with the appellant, now aged  four.  He
       is also British. All her children are in education of some sort.  The
       appellant was happy to take on a relationship with all the  children.
       The  sponsor  was  a  hard-working  single  mother.  The  family  was
       attempting to be self-sufficient. There was little public interest in
       terms of the economic  well-being  of  the  country  given  that  the
       arrival of the appellant  would  reduce  the  sponsor's  reliance  on
       benefits.


   20. Mr Avery took me to the public interest, as defined in  section  117B
       of the 2002 Act. It was clear that  the  ability  of  the  family  to
       support itself was an important consideration in the  maintenance  of
       immigration control. The Court of  Appeal  decided  in  MM  that  the
       minimum income requirement set by the rules was justified.  The  fact
       the sponsor was British was not relevant and the rules must apply  in
       the majority of cases to sponsors who are British. He argued  it  was
       difficult to see why this made the case particularly compelling.  The
       ultimate effect of the financial requirements of the rules  was  that
       families are split  up.  In  terms  of  the  best  interests  of  the
       children, he reiterated that the appellant has  a  child  in  Somalia
       already. The decision was not disproportionate.


   21. Ms Benfield again said the appellant wanted to work and  support  his
       family and this lessened  the  weight  to  be  given  to  the  public
       interest in accordance with section 117B.


   22. The burden of proof is on the appellant and the standard of proof  is
       the ordinary civil standard of a  balance  of  probabilities.  I  may
       consider only the circumstances  appertaining  at  the  time  of  the
       decision to refuse.


   23. It is common ground in this appeal that the Immigration  Rules  could
       not be met at the date of decision, which was 16 April 2013. However,
       it was relevant to see to what extent the rules were not met.  It  is
       clear from the findings of the First-tier Tribunal that the appellant
       and sponsor are in a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  and  that
       they hold the requisite intentions to live  together  permanently  in
       the  UK.  The  sponsor  has  produced  her  divorce  certificate  and
       therefore the marriage between the appellant and the sponsor  was  no
       longer doubted. As seen, by the date of the entry clearance manager's
       review, the appellant had passed a suitable  English  language  test.
       However, the financial requirements of the rules were not met because
       the sponsor derived her income from income support, housing  benefit,
       child benefit and child tax credits.


   24. The First-tier Tribunal appears to  have  been  undecided  about  the
       value of the job offer submitted by the appellant. This consisted  of
       a letter on the notepaper of  the  Horn  of  Africa  Refugee  Welfare
       Group, dated  14  December  2012,  and  addressed  "to  whom  it  may
       concern". The letter stated that the organisation would like to  help
       the sponsor to bring her husband to the UK and  they  were  therefore
       offering him a part-time job as an outreach worker with a  salary  of
       �650 per month, starting as  soon  as  he  arrived  with  a  two-year
       contract to enable him to live with  his  partner  if  he  came.  The
       letter was signed by Ibrahim Elmi, projects manager.


   25. No additional evidence has been provided regarding that job offer. In
       my judgment, no weight can be given to it for a  number  of  reasons.
       The letter contains very few  particulars  of  the  job  and  it  has
       patently been provided to assist the sponsor to bring her husband  to
       the UK. There is no evidence of the appellant  accepting  the  offer,
       although this may be assumed. There is  no  evidence  supporting  the
       apparent implication of  the  letter  that  the  Horn  of  Africa,  a
       charitable  organisation,  had  funding  in  place  to   appoint   an
       additional employee or that the correct procedures had been  followed
       with respect to recruitment. Moreover, the letter must be regarded as
       having gone out of date long before the date of decision. It  is  not
       plausible that, if this were a genuine vacancy, a job could  be  held
       open for so long. That is because, if there were a  genuine  vacancy,
       the employers would need to fill it and it can be assumed  there  are
       suitably qualified people in the UK who would take it.


   26. I therefore disregard the job offer, although there is no  reason  to
       discount the evidence that the appellant wishes to work and  that  he
       has knowledge of English. His statement  is  silent  about  his  work
       experience.


   27. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  quantify  the  sponsor's  current
       reliance on welfare benefits. It seems some of her  children  are  at
       university in which case they  would  no  longer  form  part  of  her
       household. However, she relies on housing benefit to pay her rent and
       income-related benefits to support herself and the  other  school-age
       children. She does not receive DLA.


   28. Other than  referring  to  a  willingness  to  work,  the  First-tier
       Tribunal made no clear findings about the  appellant's  skills  which
       might assist  the  sponsor  to  show  he  would  be  likely  to  find
       employment. There is no evidence  of  the  availability  of  suitable
       employment, other than the Horn of Africa letter. It is difficult  to
       accept the appellant would have the necessary experience of the UK to
       act effectively in the role  of  outreach  worker.  It  is  therefore
       difficult even to begin to consider the argument made by Ms  Benfield
       that the arrival  of  the  appellant  would  diminish  the  sponsor's
       reliance on benefits.


   29. In MM the Court of Appeal held the policy aim of the  minimum  income
       requirement was to safeguard the economic wellbeing of  the  UK.  The
       Secretary of State's analysis of the link between higher  income  and
       better integration was rational. As such, the interference engendered
       by the minimum income requirement of  the  rules  was  necessary  and
       struck a fair balance between the interests  of  applicants  and  the
       community as a whole. It is not therefore legitimate, as  the  First-
       tier Tribunal appears to have done, to disregard the  prohibition  in
       Appendix FM on taking into  account  the  earning  potential  of  the
       appellant.


   30. All  of  this  places  significant  obstacles  in  the  path  of  the
       appellant. Ms Benfield must be right when  she  argues  there  is  no
       realistic prospect of the financial requirements of the  rules  being
       met by the sponsor  in  the  foreseeable  future,  even  taking  into
       account her own willingness to work so as to reduce her  reliance  on
       welfare benefits.


   31. The appellant relies on article 8 outside the  rules.  It  is  common
       ground  the  determinative  issue  is  the  proportionality  of   the
       decision. In  Oludoyi  the  Upper  Tribunal  explained  there  is  no
       'threshold test' before considering  article  8  outside  the  rules.
       However, it is necessary to look at the evidence to see if  there  is
       anything which has not already  been  adequately  considered  in  the
       context of the rules and which could lead to a successful  article  8
       claim.


   32. Parliament has resolved that the consideration of the public interest
       in the proportionality assessment must take into account the  partial
       definition of the public interest contained in section  117B  of  the
       2002 Act, which reads in relevant part as follows:


           "117BArticle 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
           cases



           (1)The maintenance of effective immigration controls is  in  the
           public interest.

           (2)It is in the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           able to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

                (a)are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

                (b)are better able to integrate into society.

           (3)It is in the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           financially independent, because such persons-

                (a)are not a burden on taxpayers, and

                (b)are better able to integrate into society.

           ..."

   33. The reference in subsection (2) to the English  language  requirement
       can be regarded as weighing in  favour  of  the  appellant.  However,
       subsections (1) and (3) confront the appellant with the same problems
       already alluded to.


   34. The strongest  point  which  the  appellant  can  raise  as  being  a
       consideration not adequately covered by the application of the  rules
       is the best interests of the children argument. Weight must be  given
       to the position of the appellant's own child with the sponsor. He  is
       British and little weight can be given to the notion of expecting the
       sponsor to relocate to Somalia so that family life can continue there
       for the reasons put forward by Ms Benfield. Apart from anything else,
       the notion would appear to be wholly impracticable given the needs of
       the sponsor's older children in the UK. All the children are  British
       and therefore entitled to look forward to enjoying the benefits which
       attach to their nationality.


   35. In Mundeba (s.55 and para 297(i)(f)) [2013] UKUT 00088(IAC), guidance
       was given on the best interests principle in out of  country  appeals
       concerning paragraph 297 of the rules, which is helpful:

           "36. The exercise of the duty by the Entry Clearance Officer  to
           assess the application under the Immigration Rules as to whether
           there are family or  other  considerations  making  the  child's
           exclusion undesirable inevitably involves an assessment of  what
           the  child's  welfare  and  best  interests  require.  Where  an
           immigration decision engages Article 8 rights, due  regard  must
           be had to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. An entry
           clearance decision for the admission of a child under 18 is  "an
           action  concerning   children...undertaken   by...administrative
           authorities" and so by Article 3  "the  best  interests  of  the
           child shall be a primary consideration".  Although the statutory
           duty under s.55 UK Borders Act 2009  only  applies  to  children
           within the UK, the  broader  duty  doubtless  explains  why  the
           Secretary of State's IDI invites  Entry  Clearance  Officers  to
           consider the statutory guidance issued under s.55."
   36. In Azimi-Moayed and  others  (decisions  affecting  children;  onward
       appeals)[2013] UKUT 00197(IAC), guidance was given on the  applicable
       principles generally:


           "(1) The case law of  the  Upper  Tribunal  has  identified  the
           following principles to assist in the determination  of  appeals
           where children are affected by the appealed decisions:

           i) As a starting point it is in the best interests  of  children
           to be with both their parents and  if  both  parents  are  being
           removed from the United Kingdom then the starting point suggests
           that so  should  dependent  children  who  form  part  of  their
           household unless there are reasons to the contrary.
           ii) It is generally in the interests of children  to  have  both
           stability and continuity of social and educational provision and
           the benefit of growing up in the cultural norms of  the  society
           to which they belong.
           iii) ..."


   37. In ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4 and Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] UKSC, [2013]
       1 WLR 3690 the Supreme Court emphasised  the  importance  of  British
       citizenship.


   38. It can safely be assumed in this  case  that  the  British  child  is
       perfectly well settled with his mother and half-siblings and that  he
       has little, if any, real attachment at present to  his  father,  with
       whom he has never lived. He is only three years of age. However, that
       will obviously change over the course of time and it would be in  his
       best interests to have a father-figure in his life. There may also be
       similar benefit for the sponsor's other children.  Occasional  visits
       abroad and contact over the  telephone  and  other  electronic  media
       would be very little compensation for having an absent father.


   39. Appendix FM of the rules requires the minimum  financial  requirement
       to be met in all cases other than those provided  for  in  exceptions
       which do not apply here.  I  must  give  due  weight  to  the  public
       interest in the rules being applied with certainty and consistency to
       all applicants. This is now reinforced by section 117B(1) of the 2002
       Act. I am not satisfied the public interest, as reinforced by section
       117B(3), is in  real  terms  diminished  by  the  appellant's  stated
       intention to work. It remained speculative as at the date of decision
       as to whether the appellant was likely to find employment so as to be
       able to reduce the sponsor's reliance on welfare benefits.


   40. Against these matters, I have  weighed  the  best  interests  of  the
       children which are a primary consideration but which are not a 'trump
       card'. The stark reality is that the sponsor is unlikely to  be  able
       to meet the financial requirements of the rules  in  the  foreseeable
       future and therefore the family separation is likely to  be  extended
       and, possibly, indefinite. However, the issue in this appeal  is  not
       an enforced family break-up but an attempt at family reunion in which
       the "moral pressures are different" (see paragraph 45 of AB (Somalia)
       v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 5). This couple chose to  marry  and  start  a
       family in the knowledge that the appellant would not be permitted  to
       come to the UK unless and until the  financial  requirements  of  the
       rules could be met. Furthermore, the appellant has never  lived  with
       his British child. In all the circumstances of the case, I do not see
       that there are  compelling  circumstances  sufficient  to  require  a
       departure to be made  from  the  rules.  Important  though  the  best
       interests of the children are, they  are  outweighed  by  the  weight
       which must be attached to the public interest in the  maintenance  of
       immigration controls.


   41. The rules provide sufficient answer to  the  circumstances  posed  by
       this appeal. The appellant has failed to demonstrate  exceptional  or
       compelling circumstances warranting a  grant  of  leave  outside  the
       rules and I dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds.
