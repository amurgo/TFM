Representation:
For the Appellant:         Ms A. Fijiwala (02.09.16) and Ms K. Pal
                           (03.10.16), Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondent/Claimant:    Mr H Kannangara, Counsel instructed by
                           Legend Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Specialist Appeals Team appeals on behalf a Border Force Officer at
    Heathrow Airport from the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  allowing
    the  claimant's  appeal  against  the  decision  ratified  by  a  Chief
    Immigration Officer to refuse the appellant leave to enter at port,  to
    cancel his existing leave to remain as a Tier  I  Entrepreneur  Migrant
    and to make directions for his removal to India as  a  person  who  had
    used deception in obtaining leave to remain, thereby engaging paragraph
    321A(2) of the Rules. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity
    direction, and I do not consider that the claimant  requires  anonymity
    for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for Granting Permission to Appeal

 2. On 19 July 2016 Upper Tribunal Judge Kekic granted permission to appeal
    for the following reasons:

         "It is the respondent's case that  the  appellant  had  made  false
         representations to obtain leave in that  he  had  obtained  an  ETS
         language certificate using a proxy test taker. The  judge  was  not
         satisfied with the respondent's evidence and allowed the appeal.


         Arguably, the  judge  erred  in  failing  to  give  weight  to  the
         documentary evidence relied on  by  the  respondent  which  related
         specifically to the appellant and  that  failed  to  give  adequate
         reasons for not doing so."


The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 3. The claimant's appeal came before Judge Cooper sitting at Taylor  House
    on 2 November 2015.  Mr Kannangara of Counsel appeared on behalf of the
    claimant, and the Border Force Officer ("BFO")  was  represented  by  a
    Home Office Presenting Officer.

 4. The BFO's case was that  the  claimant  had  submitted  a  false  TOEIC
    certificate in support of his application for leave to remain.  He  had
    purportedly taken the test at South Quay college on 11  December  2012,
    but ETS had reported that the test result was invalid because  a  proxy
    test taker had been used.

 5. In support of this case the BFO relied on  generic  witness  statements
    from Rebecca Collings and Peter Millington, a  witness  statement  from
    Hilary Rickshaw and an ETS SELT Source Data excerpt (otherwise known as
    an ETS Lookup Tool) showing that the claimant's TOEIC had been declared
    "invalid" by ETS (Appendix E). The BFO also relied  on  the  claimant's
    performance in the interview conducted at port,  contending  in  the  8
    page Report justifying the refusal of leave to enter that he was unduly
    vague about some details relating to the taking of the  test  and  that
    some of his answers on other points of detail were simply not credible.
    In particular, he had not mentioned that his team member, Mr  Inderdeep
    Singh, had purportedly also taken the test on the  same  occasion,  and
    his test had also been declared invalid (Appendix J); and he claimed to
    have taken the test in Gants Hill, whereas South Quay  college  was  in
    the Docklands.

 6. The claimant was called as a witness, and he was cross-examined by  the
    Presenting Officer. He insisted he took the test  and  denied  using  a
    proxy test taker. His performance in interview at port was affected  by
    the fact that he was  interviewed  in  the  very  early  hours  of  the
    morning, having just come off a long flight from India.

 7. In his subsequent decision, the judge  held  at  [34]  that  there  was
    nothing in the spreadsheet  which  showed  that  the  test  result  was
    declared invalid because of a match being found,  or  because  of  test
    administration irregularities at the test centre.

 8. At [37] the judge held that the strength  of  the  BFO's  evidence  was
    seriously undermined by the revelation that his team  member  had  been
    interviewed on 8 July 2015, and on 11 August 2015 he had been found  to
    be a credible witness with the consequence that the Secretary of  State
    had closed the case against him.

 9. At [38] the judge acknowledged that while  the  BFO  had  identified  a
    number of answers in interview  which  did  not  seem  very  convincing
    (although the claimant had explanations for each of them  in  his  oral
    evidence), "the starting point is that the [BFO] must show  that  there
    has been some dishonesty."

The Error of Law Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

10. On behalf of the BFO, Ms Fijiwala developed the arguments  advanced  in
    the application for permission to appeal, and she relied heavily on the
    decision of the Court of Appeal in Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department and (1) Muhammad Shehzad and (2) MD  Chowdhury  [2016]  EWCA
    Civ 615.

11. On behalf of the claimant, Mr Kannangara submitted there was no  error,
    or no material error, having regard to the guidance  given  in  SM  and
    Qadir v Secretary of State for the Home Department (ETS -  Evidence -
    Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 00229 (IAC).

12. Having heard from the representatives, I ruled that an error of law was
    made out. I gave my reasons for so finding in short form, and  my  full
    reasons  are  set  out  below.  After   a   further   discussion,   the
    representatives were in agreement that I  should  remake  the  decision
    following a resumed hearing at which the claimant would be tendered  as
    a witness. I gave directions for the resumed hearing, and these are  on
    the file.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

13. The ratio decidendi of SM  and  Qadir  is  that,  despite  the  serious
    shortcomings in the evidence relied on by the Secretary  of  State,  it
    was sufficient to discharge the evidential burden of  raising  a  prima
    facie case, such that the evidential burden shifted to SM and Qadir  to
    produce  an  innocent  explanation  for  their   test   results   being
    invalidated by ETS.

14. Of particular significance are the following passages in the decision:

         "68. As our analysis and conclusions in the  immediately  preceding
         section make clear, we  have  substantial  reservations  about  the
         strength and quality of the Secretary  of  State's  evidence.   Its
         shortcomings are manifest. On the other hand, while bearing in mind
         that the context is one of alleged deception, we must be mindful of
         the comparatively  modest  threshold  which  an  evidential  burden
         entails. This calls for an evaluative assessment on the part of the
         tribunal. By an admittedly narrow margin we are satisfied that  the
         Secretary of State has discharged this burden.  The effect of  this
         is that there  is  a  burden,  again  an  evidential  one,  on  the
         Appellants of raising an innocent explanation.


         ...


         78.  The events of 2012 are of  obvious  significance.   The  TOEIC
         Certificate was, on its face, obtained by this Appellant [SM] after
         undergoing the necessary testing on two separate dates, 20  and  26
         March 2012.  We acknowledge that, in the abstract, his score in the
         modules of listening and reading is very high indeed, being 930 out
         of a possible 990 (circa 90%).  In  the  modules  of  speaking  and
         writing the scores recorded are also high, being  160/200  in  each
         instance (circa 80%).  Duly armed with his TOEIC Certificate,  this
         Appellant applied for leave to remain in the United  Kingdom.   His
         application was refused, giving rise to a hearing before the First-
         tier Tribunal ("FtT") on 05 September 2012.


         79.  We consider  this  aspect  of  the  evidence  to  be  of  some
         significance.  From the Tribunal's determination  one  learns  that
         this Appellant attended  the  hearing,  gave  evidence,  was  cross
         examined and was re-examined. No interpreter was required and there
         is no indication of the slightest difficulty  in  communication  or
         comprehension.   We  note  further  that  during  the   period   of
         (approximately) September 2010  to  February  2012  this  Appellant
         claims that he was pursuing courses at two colleges simultaneously,
         which we accept.   We  infer  from  this  fact,  coupled  with  the
         successful outcomes, that his mastery of English was of a high  and
         progressively improving level.


         80.  We consider that in appeals of this nature  evidence  of  this
         kind is likely to be of substantially  greater  force  and  cogency
         than the  tribunal's  own  assessment  of  an  appellant's  English
         language proficiency based on performance at  the  appeal  hearing.
         This is especially pertinent in the present case, given  that  some
         three years have  elapsed  since  this  Appellant  claims  to  have
         secured his TOEIC certificate. In some of the FtT decisions in this
         field one finds observations concerning  the  appellant's  apparent
         fluency in, and command of, the English language.  We consider that
         Judges should be cautious in adopting this approach  for  at  least
         three reasons.  The first is the passage of time.   The  second  is
         that Judges are not language testing or linguistics  experts.   The
         third is that,  to  date,  there  has  been  no  expert  linguistic
         evidence in any of these cases.


         ...


         101. We have already held  that  the  evidential  burden  of  proof
         resting on the Secretary of State  has  been  narrowly  discharged.
         For the reasons which we have given, we  are  satisfied  that  both
         Appellants have discharged their  burden  of  raising  an  innocent
         explanation of the prima facie indications of  deception  on  their
         part  in  the  Secretary  of  State's  evidence.  For  the  reasons
         elaborated, we conclude, without hesitation, that the Secretary  of
         State has failed to establish, on  the  balance  of  probabilities,
         that the Appellants' prima facie innocent explanations  are  to  be
         rejected. The legal burden of proof falling  on  the  Secretary  of
         State has not been discharged. The Appellants are clear winners."


15. The significance of the recent Court of Appeal  decision  is  that  the
    finding by the Presidential panel at paragraph [68] has  been  endorsed
    by higher and thus binding authority.  Beatson LJ, giving  the  leading
    judgment of the court, summarised the central issue which the court was
    addressing at paragraph [19]:

         "These appeals are only concerned with whether their evidence  (the
         generic evidence of Mr Millington and Ms Collings  regarding  ETS's
         analysis of the  spoken  English  component  of  the  TOEIC  test),
         together with evidence that  the  tests  of  the  individual  under
         consideration  has  been  assessed  as  'invalid'  rather  than  as
         'questionable' because of problems at the test centre, suffices  to
         satisfy the evidential burden of showing dishonesty  that  lies  on
         the Secretary of State and to impose an evidential  burden  on  the
         individual to raise an innocent explanation.  The  question  before
         us is thus not the ultimate reliability  of  the  evidence  or  the
         ultimate disposition of the appeals."


16. In Mr Chowdhury's case, discussed by Beatson LJ at paragraphs [24]  and
    [25], the first instance judge held there was no  evidence  identifying
    Mr Chowdhury as a person whose test was  invalid.   But  in  fact,  the
    evidence included a screenshot of the results which  stated  that  this
    was the position.  The same first instance judge held  there  could  be
    multiple reasons for invalidation, some  of  which  might  not  involve
    fraud or deception.  Beatson LJ went on to hold  that  both  the  first
    instance judge and the Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge who dealt  with  the
    appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  had  misunderstood  the  nature  of  the
    evidence.  Beatson LJ continued in paragraph [26]:

         "The reason for the misunderstandings by the Tribunals may be  that
         the language used  by  Mr  Millington  and  Ms  Collings  in  their
         statements to explain a technical process is not altogether  clear.
         But, whatever the reason, in these circumstances,  in  my  judgment
         the in limine rejection of the Secretary  of  State's  evidence  as
         even sufficient to shift the evidential  burden  was  an  error  of
         law."


17. The same evidence that was  deployed  by  the  Secretary  of  State  in
    Chowdhury has been deployed by the BFO in this  appeal.   This  is  the
    generic evidence of Mr Millington and Ms Collings coupled with specific
    evidence supplied by ETS that the speaking and writing  test  taken  by
    the claimant has been designated by ETS as invalid.

18. Accordingly, applying the reasoning of Beatson LJ with  respect  to  Mr
    Chowdhury's case, the evidence in the BFO bundle raises a  prima  facie
    case of fraud, so as to impose an evidential burden on the claimant  to
    raise an innocent explanation.

19. There is thus a clear error in the judge's reasoning at paragraphs [31]-
    [34]. His reasoning betrays a similar misunderstanding of  the  generic
    evidence as occurred at first instance in the case discussed by Beatson
    LJ. The judge proceeds on the false premise  that  there  are  multiple
    potential reasons for a test result  being  declared  invalid,  and  he
    wrongly  directs  himself  that  an  invalid  test  result   does   not
    necessarily entail a representation by ETS that there has been use of a
    proxy test taker. He thus sets up a false dichotomy at [34]  between  a
    match being found and there being test administration irregularities at
    the test centre.  In fact, as held by the Court  of  Appeal,  "invalid"
    only denotes a match being found (and hence a proxy test taker). If ETS
    had cancelled the claimant's result due to irregularities at  the  test
    centre,  it  would  have  been  designated  as  "questionable"  not  as
    "invalid".

20. This error in the judge's line  of  reasoning  fatally  undermines  the
    conclusion he reaches at paragraph [39] that the BFO has not  made  his
    case. It  is  apparent  from  the  end  of  paragraph  [38]  that  this
    conclusion is based on the erroneous proposition that the BFO  has  not
    moved off the starting point by showing some dishonesty.  In  fact  the
    BFO has made out a prima facie case of dishonesty simply  by  deploying
    the generic evidence coupled with the specific evidence from ETS  about
    the test result being invalid.

21. Mr Kannangara submits that any error is not  material  as  the  outcome
    would have been the same if the judge had followed the  guidance  given
    in SM and Qadir. But the effect  of  the  judge's  misdirection  is  to
    engender procedural unfairness: the scales are already weighted against
    the BFO's case even  before  the  judge  has  come  on  to  assess  (a)
    additional evidence relied on by the BFO  as  fortifying  the  case  of
    dishonesty and (b) evidence going to  an  innocent  explanation.  As  a
    consequence of his error, the judge has not given adequate reasons  for
    in effect dismissing the additional evidence relied on by the  BFO.  It
    is clear that he did not see the need to elaborate further on the topic
    of the claimant's performance in interview as he wrongly found that the
    BFO had not made out a prima facie case of dishonesty.

22. It was open to the  judge  to  attach  weight  to  the  fact  that  the
    claimant's team member has been exonerated by the Home Office, but this
    does not deliver a fatal blow to the case against  the  claimant.  Just
    because the team  member  provided  an  innocent  explanation  for  his
    invalid test result which was found credible by the  Home  Office  does
    not mean that the claimant has an innocent explanation which should  be
    found credible by the BFO or by the Tribunal.

Conclusion

23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law,  such
    that it must be set aside and remade.

The Resumed Hearing

24. At the resumed hearing to remake the decision, the claimant was  called
    as a witness and  he  adopted  as  his  evidence  in  chief  a  witness
    statement dated 29 September 2016.

25. At the time that he applied in the Tier 1 category on 12 December  2012
    he was coming to the end of his studies at  E-Thames  Graduate  School.
    As he could not rely on his degree certificate (which was  not  awarded
    until 10 January 2013) he decided to do an English  language  test.  He
    recalled "Montrose House" as it was the same building in which  he  had
    studied year one of his degree course. The last two years of his degree
    course had been at the Canary Wharf campus of E-Thames Graduate School.
     He sat the test at Montrose House.

26. He was interviewed about the test on 19 September 2014, over two  years
    later. He had been travelling for 20 hours,  including  time  spent  in
    transit. After such a long flight, he could  not  recall  every  detail
    about the test. Also, he could not recall the name of the test  centre.
    He was not studying there. He just went there to take the test.

27. The claimant was cross-examined by Ms Pal, and  he  answered  questions
    for clarification purposes from  me.  He  had  done  the  speaking  and
    writing components of the test on 11 December 2012, and the reading and
    listening components the following day. He was living in Barking at the
    time, which was 20mins away by car. The  test  centre  was  South  Quay
    College, and it was located on the 2nd floor of Montrose  House,  which
    was in Gants Hill, Ilford, Essex.  E-Thames  Graduate  School  occupied
    the other floors of Montrose House in the  first  year  of  his  degree
    course. They then got a new campus in Canary Wharf. In his third  year,
    the campus at  Canary  Wharf  was  taken  over  by  the  University  of
    Sunderland. It became the London campus of this university.

28. He booked the test through an agent. He was short of time, and  he  was
    finding it difficult to book a test himself due to the level of demand.
    He could not secure a date to do the test. The agent was recommended to
    him. He paid the agent between �150 and �200  to  book  the  test.  The
    agent told him to go to Montrose House to sit the test. The  agent  had
    premises in the same building as his solicitor. This was  the  Imperial
    Building in East Ham.

29. His business partner had sat the test at the same time. He had not used
    an agent to arrange the booking. He thought his partner had booked  the
    test sometime later. I asked  him  if  it  was  by  design  or  just  a
    coincidence that they had ended up sitting the test at  the  same  time
    and in the same test centre. The claimant said it was a coincidence.

30. I asked the claimant if he could recall details of his written test. He
    said they were shown pictures, and they had to write a  sentence  about
    each of them in response to a question. They also had to do an essay of
    200-300 words on one topic, explaining why they  agreed  or  disagreed,
    giving reasons.

31. In closing submissions on behalf of the  Secretary  of  State,  Ms  Pal
    submitted that the claimant had not provided an  innocent  explanation.
    In reply, Mr Kanannangara submitted that the claimant had given a  very
    plausible explanation.

Discussion and Findings on Remaking

32. The starting point is that the Secretary of State has made out a  prima
    facie case of fraud, but only by a narrow margin.

33. The thrust of the evidence which Dr Harrison gave to  the  Presidential
    panel in SM and Qadir was  that  the  number  of  false  positive  test
    results (i.e. incorrect voice matches) might be  very  considerable  in
    percentage terms. The necessary implication of the findings made by the
    Presidential panel at [68] and [101] is that, in any given  case  where
    reliance is only placed on the generic evidence plus  an  invalid  test
    result, there is a very real possibility that the  applicant  has  been
    the innocent victim of a false positive test  result.  (In  this  case,
    reliance is also placed on the claimant's performance in interview.)

34. The implication of the evidence given at the hearing before the  First-
    tier Tribunal is that the claimant's team member was  accepted  by  the
    Home Office as being the innocent  victim  of  a  false  positive  test
    result. But I do not consider this takes matters any further so far  as
    the claimant is concerned.

35. The interview notes in respect of Mr Singh are not before  me,  and  so
    the evidence given by the claimant about where he took  the  test,  and
    how he ended up taking the test at the same time and same place  as  Mr
    Singh, cannot be cross-checked against Mr Singh's explanation.

36. As Mr Singh was not called as a witness, and  he  has  not  provided  a
    witness statement, there is no corroboration for the claimant's account
    that he took the speaking test with Mr Singh at the same test centre on
    11 December 2012.

37. As contended by the BFO in his report, it is not plausible that a  test
    centre in Gants Hill would have the name "South Quay College". The name
    is much more consistent with a test centre located  in  the  Docklands,
    which is where it is, according to its website: see the report at [22].
    The claimant has not brought forward any documentary evidence  to  show
    that there is or was a test centre at Montrose House  by  the  name  of
    South Quay College.

38. It is credible that the claimant would have been very  tired  and  jet-
    lagged when interviewed about his test at Heathrow airport,  and  so  a
    considerable degree of vagueness and inaccuracy in his answers  is  not
    necessarily indicative of him not having genuinely taken the test.

39. But the claimant has continued to be inconsistent, despite  having  had
    the opportunity to reflect carefully and calmly on the details  of  the
    test. The implication of his recent witness statement is that  when  he
    decided to sit for an English language test, he chose the  test  centre
    at Montrose House as he recalled "the  place  and  the  building"  from
    studying there in the first year of his degree. But the thrust  of  his
    oral evidence was that he took the test there by chance. He could  have
    sat the test anywhere in London, but the agent he employed happened  to
    direct him to Montrose House.  Another  implausible  coincidence  which
    emerged at the hearing is that his team member should  have  separately
    and by pure chance booked to sit the same test on the same day  at  the
    same test centre.

40. The discrepancies in his account are considerable. In interview he said
    the test cost no more than �50 (including the booking fee)  whereas  he
    said in evidence it cost between �150 and �200.  In  interview  he  was
    asked whether he had taken all the elements on the same date and he was
    asked how long the test took. He said 3-4 hours. He did not state  that
    the test had taken place over two days. It is unlikely  that  he  would
    have forgotten that he had to go back the  following  day  to  sit  two
    further components, if that was what happened. In interview he said the
    writing test involved an essay of 2,000 to 3,000 words whereas  in  his
    oral evidence he said the essay was between 200 and 300 words.  In  his
    witness statement he said he could not recall the name of the  building
    where he sat his test when questioned in interview, because he had  not
    studied there. But this is  not  consistent  with  his  claim  to  have
    studied at Montrose House in the first year of his degree.

41. The academic  transcript  provided  by  the  University  of  Sunderland
    conveys the information that the claimant studied at E-Thames  Graduate
    School campus from 9 January 2012 until 10 January 2013;  and  that  he
    completed six modules in semester 3 (three of which fell into the 2011-
    12 academic year, and three of which  fell  into  the  2012-3  academic
    year). This information is consistent with what the  claimant  said  at
    interview, which was that he had completed his degree in two  or  three
    semesters. It is not however consistent with his oral  evidence,  which
    is that he spent three years following his degree course.

42. The claimant's ability  to  obtain  a  2.2  degree  in  Accounting  and
    Financial Management in the period leading up to the test  is  strongly
    indicative of him having the required level of competency in English to
    be able to obtain a TOEIC certificate without using a proxy test taker.
    But the claimant was unable to recall in interview what  his  strongest
    component was, despite having ostensibly achieved 100% in his  speaking
    score (200 out of 200) and a very high score  of  190  out  of  200  in
    writing. It is unlikely that the claimant  would  forget  that  he  had
    achieved the highest possible score in speaking  if  he  had  genuinely
    taken the test.

43. For the above reasons, I find that the claimant  has  not  provided  an
    innocent explanation which is credible, and so the Secretary  of  State
    has discharged the legal burden of proof.

44. The evidence does not disclose a viable private life  claim  under  the
    rules. Turning to an Article 8 claim outside the Rules, I  accept  that
    questions 1 and 2 of the Razgar test should be answered  in  favour  of
    the claimant with regard to the establishment of private  life  in  the
    United Kingdom.  Questions 3 and 4 of the Razgar test must be  answered
    in  favour  of  the   respondent.    On   the   crucial   question   of
    proportionality,  I  must  take  into  account  the   public   interest
    considerations arising under Section 117B of the 2002 Act. The claimant
    speaks English and he presents as financially independent.  But  little
    weight can be given to a  private  life  which  is  built  up  while  a
    person's status here in precarious.  The claimant does not qualify  for
    further leave to remain under the Rules, and the public interest in his
    removal is strongly reinforced by his use of deception.

45. In the report at [23] the BFO notes that the  claimant  said  that  the
    third party funder was  Ramesh  Lal,  whereas  he  represented  in  his
    successful application that the third party funder was  Raj  Kumar.  Of
    greater significance perhaps is that the claimant said that he had  not
    yet asked the third party funder to transfer  from  India  any  of  the
    funds referred to in the application.  So at the date of the  interview
    the business was not yet up and running, and there is no evidence  that
    matters have moved on since then.

46. For the above reasons, I find that the  decision  appealed  against  is
    proportionate to the legitimate  public  end  sought  to  be  achieved,
    namely the prevention of disorder  and  the  maintenance  of  firm  and
    effective immigration controls.

No anonymity direction is made.
