                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
INTRODUCTION

 1. These are four conjoined  appeals.   The  first  three  Appellants  are
    siblings who, in sequence, are aged 12, 21 and 14  years  respectively.
    The fourth named Appellant, aged 38, is their mother.  Each is of Iraqi
    nationality.  The husband of the latter and father of the family  ("the
    sponsor") resides in the United Kingdom.  The  first  three  Appellants
    applied for clearance to enter the United Kingdom on the basis of child
    settlement.  The fourth Appellant similarly applied, on  the  basis  of
    spousal settlement.  All four applications were refused by the relevant
    Entry Clearance Officer (the "ECO"), in a series of decisions  made  on
    26th and 30th June 2011.  By its determination promulgated on 24th July
    2012,  the  First-Tier  Tribunal  (the  "FtT")  dismissed  the  ensuing
    appeals.  The Appellants now appeal, with permission, to this Tribunal.



THE APPEALS, FRAMEWORK

 2. The refusal decisions of the ECO, duly analysed, contain the  following
    findings and assessments:

    (i)  The applications contained an assertion that the sponsor is a self-
         employed grocery shop owner.  The only supporting evidence  was  an
         accountant's letter containing  a  profit  forecast  for  the  year
         ending July 2011.

    (ii) The application contained no evidence of income or profit such  as
         company accounts, tax returns, Inland Revenue  receipts  or  profit
         and loss accounts.

     iii) Based on the above, there was no evidence  that  the  sponsor  is
          engaged in business as claimed or is in receipt of a regular  and
          secure income.


      iv) The claim that the sponsor has an income of  �1350.00  per  month
          was bare assertion, unsupported by the bank statements submitted,
          which showed a closing balance of �760.00 on 31st May 2010.

       v) The claim that the Appellants were in regular contact with  their
          father/husband was unsupported.  Similarly, there was  little  or
          no evidence of family photographs indicative of mutual support or
          an enduring, subsisting relationship.

      vi) The assertion that the Appellants "met" the sponsor  once  weekly
          was demonstrably false.

     vii) There was a failure to state clearly when the Appellants had last
          seen the sponsor.

    viii) Based on the applications presented, the five  persons  concerned
          had last lived as a family in 2001 viz 10 years previously.


 3. Based  on  the  findings  and  assessments  rehearsed  above,  the  ECO
    considered whether the applications complied with paragraph 281 of  the
    Immigration  Rules.   This  gave  rise  to   the   following   specific
    conclusions:

     a) The Appellants would not be able to adequately maintain  themselves
        in the United Kingdom without recourse to public funds.


     b) The sponsor would be unable to adequately maintain and  accommodate
        the Appellants without recourse to public funds.

     c)  A  subsisting  relationship  with  the  sponsor   had   not   been
        demonstrated.

    This gave rise to the omnibus conclusion that the applications were non-
    compliant  with  the  Rules.  The  ECO  then  considered  briefly,   and
    dismissed, the Appellants' claims under Article 8 ECHR, in the following
    pithy sentence:


         "I have considered your application under Article 8  of  the  Human
         Rights Act, however this is a qualified right,  proportionate  with
         the need to maintain an effective immigration and border control."

 4. Dismissing the appeals, the  FtT  Judge  noted  that  the  sponsor  had
    acquired the status of naturalised British  citizen  with  effect  from
    11th October 2011, having entered the United Kingdom  originally  as  a
    refugee.   The  Judge  found,  specifically,  that  the   marriage   is
    subsisting and  that  the  five  persons  concerned  intended  to  live
    together permanently as members of the same family.  Having  summarised
    the relevant evidence and  competing  arguments,  the  Judge  made  the
    following further specific findings:

    (i)  There was no  satisfactory  evidence  of  the  availability  of  a
          residential property suitable to accommodate everyone concerned.


    (ii) The "accountancy" evidence was wholly unsatisfactory, as  was  the
          related evidence given by the sponsor about business and income.

     iii)  The  sponsor's  claims  about  his  business  and  income   were
          significantly  undermined   by   the   evidence   concerning   an
          undischarged tax liability to HMRC and his admitted inability  to
          settle this debt.


      iv) While the sponsor claimed to be in a  business  partnership  with
          his cousin, the HMRC evidence disclosed that he is not taxed as a
          partner.


    The Judge expressed "grave concerns" about the accountancy and  related
    evidence.  He stated that he could not repose any  trust  therein.   He
    made two clearly identifiable conclusions.   The  first  was  that  the
    Appellants could not satisfy  the  accommodation  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The second was that they had failed to satisfy  the
    financial requirements.

 5. In his consideration of the Appellants' claims under  Article  8  ECHR,
    the Judge noted the extremely limited evidence  concerning  the  claims
    that they had fled from a refugee camp in Syria and also had  to  leave
    Iraq. He accepted the  sponsor's  evidence  that  he  had  made  fairly
    frequent visits to the  Appellants  in  Iraq,  noting  that  these  had
    occurred without mishap.  The Judge noted the absence of  any  evidence
    about adverse impact on the  two  younger  Appellants  arising  out  of
    separation from their father.  He recorded that a fourth child  of  the
    marriage had been born very recently (on 7th March 2012).  He accepted,
    by implication, that the sponsor had been providing funds to  his  wife
    and children.  The Judge made the following conclusion:

         "......  Currently the  best  interests  of  the  children  do  not
         warrant admission to the United Kingdom.  Their  care  and  welfare
         has been provided by their mother and she continues to comply  with
         this duty apparently  without  difficulty.  I  am  not  advised  or
         presented with  evidence  that  there  [are]  difficulties  on  the
         education, financial, welfare or general living fronts .....


         I am satisfied from the evidence ................  that  there  has
         been no breach  of  the  Appellants'  Article  8  rights  as  I  am
         satisfied that the family life can reasonably  be  expected  to  be
         enjoyed elsewhere, as already indicated."

    In thus concluding, the Judge did not perform the five  stage  exercise
    formulated by Lord Bingham in Razgar - v - Secretary of State  for  the
    Home Department [2004] 2 AC 368, paragraph [17].


 6. The grounds of appeal contented  that  the  Judge  had  erred  in  fact
    relating to the current whereabouts and plight of the Appellants.   All
    of them, it is asserted, live in a refugee camp in Syria,  having  fled
    from Iraq.  It is further complained that the Judge failed  to  grapple
    with the evidence concerning the inaccessibility of the  Appellants  to
    the sponsor in their current  circumstances.   The  Judge  was  further
    criticised for failing to recognise that the most recently  born  child
    of the family is a British citizen who, given the  Judge's  endorsement
    of the ECO's decisions,  will  be  unable  to  enjoy  his  citizenship.
    Permission to appeal was granted accordingly.

CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSIONS

 7. As the summary in paragraph 6 above indicates, there is no challenge to
    the Judge's conclusion that the ECO  correctly  dismissed  all  of  the
    applications under the Immigration Rules.  Rather, the contention  that
    the Judge erred in law is confined to his assessment of the Appellants'
    claims under Article 8 ECHR  and  his  inter-related  consideration  of
    section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act  2009  ("the
    2009 Act").  I interpose the observation  that  any  challenge  to  the
    Judge's decision that all of  the  applications  were  manifestly  non-
    compliant with the Immigration Rules would have been doomed to fail.

 8.  At  the  hearing,   the   arguments   of   the   parties'   respective
    representatives focused on a  statutory  prohibition  which  arises  in
    certain contexts.  The appeals pursued by the  Appellants  against  the
    decisions  of  the  ECO  engaged  section  85(5)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act"),  the  effect  whereof
    was  to  restrict  the  FtT  to  considering  "only  the  circumstances
    appertaining at  the  time  of  the  decision  to  refuse".   This  was
    formulated in the argument of Mr McTaggart as the central issue in  the
    appeal.  In AS (Somalia)  -  v  -  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2009] UKHL 32, the House of  Lords   rejected  a  challenge
    that section 85(5) is incompatible with Article 8 ECHR.   Four  of  the
    members of the Judicial Committee  acknowledged  the  possibility  that
    this remedy might be appropriate in a suitable  individual  care.   Per
    Lord Hope, paragraph [21]:

         "...  I would not rule out the  possibility  of  a  declaration  of
         incompatibility in an individual case if the circumstances were  so
         clearly  focused  as  to  enable  the   precise   nature   of   the
         incompatibility  with  the  applicant's  Article  8  right  to   be
         identified."

    Mr McTaggart was  unavoidably  constrained  to  acknowledge  that  this
    Tribunal is not empowered to make a declaration  that  a  provision  of
    primary legislation is incompatible with a person's  Convention  right:
    see the definition of "court" in section 4  of  the  Human  Rights  Act
    1998.  Bowing to the inevitable, Mr McTaggart agreed with the  Tribunal
    that this presented an insurmountable obstacle, as it precluded the FtT
    - and, of course, this Tribunal - from considering either the birth  of
    the  most  recent  child  of  the  family  or  the  sponsor's  evidence
    concerning current conditions in Syria.  Since  the  error  of  law  on
    which the Appellants relied was based on  the  birth  of  the  youngest
    child and various outworkings thereof, together with  certain  post-ECO
    decision evidence, the  conclusion  that  the  appeals  cannot  succeed
    follows inexorably.

DECISION

 9. I dismiss all appeals and affirm the decision of the FtT.
