                                                                 Respondents

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1. The Secretary of State appeals, with permission, against the decision  of
   the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Mensah) to allow the respondents'  appeals
   against the refusal of their applications (in the case of the  first  and
   third appellants) for leave to remain as Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrants
   under the Points Based System and (in the case of the  second  appellant)
   as the dependent of the first appellant.


2. The first and second respondents are citizens of Pakistan. They have  two
   young children who are under 4 years of age and  who  were  born  in  the
   United Kingdom.  The third respondent is a single man who is a citizen of
   India. The first and third  respondents  are  business  partners  in  the
   United Kingdom and it was upon this basis that they applied for leave  to
   remain as Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrants. It was  common  ground  in  the
   First-tier Tribunal that those applications  could  not  succeed  on  the
   basis  of  the  documents  that  were  before  the  decision-maker.   The
   respondents nevertheless submitted fresh documentation  to  the  Tribunal
   which, had  they  been  before  the  decision-maker,  would  likely  have
   resulted in their applications being granted. However, the  Tribunal  was
   precluded allowing their appeals  on  this  basis  as  a  result  of  the
   restrictions on the admission of fresh evidence imposed by Section 85  of
   the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  (as  amended).  The
   Tribunal  therefore  allowed  the  appeals  on  the   ground   that   the
   respondents' removal from the United Kingdom would be  incompatible  with
   their right to respect for private life, as guaranteed by  Article  8  of
   the 1950 European Convention for  the  Protection  of  Human  Rights  and
   Fundamental Freedoms. The grounds of appeal  against  that  decision  are
   that the Tribunal (1) took account of an immaterial matter,  namely,  the
   fact that the first and third respondents would likely succeed in a fresh
   application for leave to remain as Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrants,  and
   (2) failed  to  direct  itself  in  relation  to  the  need  to  identify
   exceptional or compelling circumstances which fell outside the  scope  of
   paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules (the requirements for leave  to
   remain on the basis of private life) and which might therefore justify  a
   grant of discretionary leave to remain outside the Rules.


3. Under the heading 'Findings', the judge began her  consideration  of  the
   appeal by citing the case of Gulshan (Article 8 -  new  Rules  -  correct
   approach) [2013] UKUT 00640.  It  was  said  in  that  case  that,  after
   applying the requirements of the rules, it was only if there may arguably
   be good grounds for granting leave to remain outside them that  it  would
   be necessary, for Article 8 purposes, to go on to consider whether  there
   were compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them. The
   judge then cited passages from the judgement of Lord  Carnwath  in  Patel
   and others [2013] UKUT 640, in which it was said that a  near-miss  under
   the rules cannot provide substance  to  a  human  rights  case  which  is
   otherwise lacking in merit. The judge thereafter continued as follows:


    19. I am therefore of the view that the term "compelling" in  the  case
    of Gulshan is saying no more than that the  consideration  outside  the
    rules is only relevant were (sic) there are  private  and  family  life
    considerations which are strong enough to  reach  the  high  Article  8
    threshold and which tip the 'Huang' test on proportionality  in  favour
    of  the  appellants  so  as   to   make   refusing   their   appeal   a
    disproportionate response in all the circumstances.


4. The judge  thereafter  noted  the  lack  of  evidence  that  any  of  the
   respondents had developed social ties to the United Kingdom beyond  those
   that they had established with each other.  She  was  nevertheless  "just
   persuaded" that Article 8 would be engaged by  the  appellants'  removal.
   She reached that conclusion on the basis of the length of time  that  the
   appellants had been studying and working in the United Kingdom.


5. The judge then turned to consider the public interest in  their  removal.
   In doing so, she noted that it was in the interests of the economic well-
   being of the country for those who reside in the  United  Kingdom  to  be
   able to meet the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules. It  was
   in  this  context  that,  at  paragraph  21,  she  made   the   following
   observation:


    It appears the appellants have access to funds which appear to  support
    them showing that it is  not  against  the  economic  interest  of  the
    country for them to remain. In fact they have sufficient funds  to  set
    up a business in the UK which would of course  contribute  economically
    to the UK through taxes. I am of the view this balances  in  favour  of
    the appellants. In terms of immigration control they could be forced to
    make a new application with the new documents and they would show  that
    they have a joint bank account with ï¿½50,000 available.


6. The judge expressed her conclusions at paragraph 22:


    Does the failure to  submit  the  correct  documents  tip  the  balance
    against the appellants? I have carefully considered the fact that  they
    now have the evidence and therefore could today meet the rules. If  the
    maintenance of  immigration  control  is  simply  to  force  legitimate
    appellants  to  apply  twice  then  I  cannot  see  how  that  benefits
    immigration control and it seems to be it would  simply  contribute  to
    clogging up the immigration system and cause cost and delay to both the
    public purse and the appellants. They have always lived lawfully in the
    UK and as far as I can see they simply misunderstood what evidence they
    needed to produce.


7. I am satisfied that the Tribunal's legal analysis of  these  appeals  was
   flawed in several respects.


8. The judge's summary of the principles in Gulshan was,  in  my  judgement,
   very-far from accurate.. For instance, it is unclear  why  (at  paragraph
   19) the judge considered that the threshold for engagement of  Article  8
   was a high one. In fact, the reverse is the case. Moreover,  the  judge's
   flawed analysis of the principles in Gulshan caused her to move  directly
   to  an  assessment  of  Article  8,  outside  the  Rules,  without  first
   considering whether (and, if so, why) the appellants were unable to  meet
   the requirements for leave to remain on the basis of private  life  under
   paragraph 276ADE of the Rules. Whilst acknowledging  that  this  was  the
   first step in the Gulshan approach, Mr Richardson argued that the judge's
   failure to take that it was immaterial  because  she  had  in  any  event
   carefully weighed all the factors that were relevant  to  the  Article  8
   assessment, whether that be within or outside the context of the Rules. I
   disagree with that submission for a number of reasons.


9. Had the judge given any consideration at all  to  paragraph  276ADE,  she
   would have been bound to conclude that  not  only  did  the  respondents'
   residence in the United Kingdom fall considerably short of the minimum 20-
   year period that is required as a basis for  settlement,  but  also  that
   they had failed to meet the alternative basis for settlement  under  that
   paragraph; namely, that they were without social, cultural or family ties
   to their respective countries of origin. This in turn would have reminded
   her, when considering whether there were compelling circumstances outside
   the Rules, that it is necessary not only to consider the  strength  of  a
   claimant's ties to the host country (which appears to have been the  sole
   focus of the judge's analysis of the appellants' private life)  but  also
   to consider the existence and strength of his or her ties to the  country
   of origin.


10. I am also satisfied that the judge conducted a legally  flawed  analysis
   of the public interest that lay in the respondents' removal.


11. Firstly, it is not legally  correct  to  say  that  the  fact  that  the
   respondents were financially self-sufficient was a matter  that  balanced
   in their favour. The correct legal  position  was  stated  in  Nasim  and
   others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC):


    A person's human rights are not enhanced  by  not  committing  criminal
    offences or not relying on public funds. The only significance of  such
    matters in cases concerning proposed or hypothetical removal  from  the
    United Kingdom is to preclude the Secretary of State from  pointing  to
    any public  interest  justifying  removal  over  and  above  the  basic
    importance of maintaining a firm and  coherent  system  of  immigration
    control.


   Insofar as the operation of businesses by foreign nationals might be said
   to  benefit  the  United  Kingdom  economy,  this  is  a  public   policy
   consideration that it is for the Secretary  of  State  to  determine  and
   implement through the operation of immigration rules,  and  not  one  for
   individual  assessment  by  the  Tribunal.  The  respondents'   financial
   situation was thus a neutral rather than a positive factor.


12. Secondly, whilst formally disavowing the  'near-miss'  approach  to  the
   assessment under Article 8, the judge's reasoning in the relation to  the
   likelihood that the first and third respondents would succeed in a  fresh
   application for leave to remain as Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrants  came
   perilously close to adopting that very approach


13. Thirdly, in assessing whether the respondents'  proposed  removal  would
   be incompatible with their rights  under  Article  8,  the  Tribunal  was
   required to consider the circumstances that appertained at  the  date  of
   the hearing of the appeal. Those circumstances did not include a  further
   application by the respondents for leave to remain. Thus,  far  from  the
   public interest 'requiring' the respondents to make a  second  in-country
   application for leave to remain, the circumstances that the Tribunal  was
   required to consider (that is to say, the  hypothetical  removal  of  the
   respondents at the date of the hearing) precluded  consideration  of  any
   such possibility.


14. The judge was thus, in reality, utilising Article 8 in order to  provide
   the respondents with a second-chance  of  meeting  the  requirements  for
   leave to remain as Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrants, they having failed  to
   do so in the application that was the subject-matter of  the  appeal.  As
   stated in the grounds of appeal,  that  was  not  an  approach  that  was
   legally open to  the  Tribunal.  Indeed,  it  was  the  very  thing  that
   Parliament had intended to prevent through its amendments to  Section  85
   of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2003


15. I therefore conclude that the First-tier Tribunal's  legal  analysis  of
   these appeals was so fundamentally flawed that  its  decision  cannot  be
   permitted  to  stand  and  must  be  set  aside.  Having   informed   the
   representatives that I had arrived at  this  conclusion,  I  heard  their
   submissions upon the substantive merits of the appeal. These have greatly
   assisted me in re-making the decision. I have based my decision  entirely
   upon the evidence that was before the First-tier Tribunal, together  with
   the primary findings of fact that it found and which I have preserved.


16. The first respondent is a Pakistani national. He arrived in  the  United
   Kingdom in January 2007, aged 33 years. He has thus resided  continuously
   in the United Kingdom for a period of over 7 years. The second respondent
   joined him in  December  2010,  aged  24  years.  She  has  thus  resided
   continuously in the United Kingdom for a period of 3 years and 4  months.
   They have two children, the eldest of which is  aged  3  years.  Although
   they were born in the United  Kingdom,  neither  of  them  is  a  British
   citizen. Their best interests are thus  served  by  them  remaining  with
   their parents. The third respondent is an Indian national. He arrived  in
   the United  Kingdom  in  February  2008,  aged  25  years.  He  has  thus
   continuously resided in the United Kingdom for a period of over 6  years.
   Although each of the respondents had leave  to  remain  throughout  their
   respective periods of residence in the United  Kingdom,  such  leave  was
   always of  limited  duration.  They  can  thus  have  had  no  legitimate
   expectation that they would be permitted to remain after their leave  had
   expired. There  is  no  evidence  as  to  whether  the  respondents  have
   continuing family, social or cultural ties to their respective  countries
   of origin. However, as they bear the legal burden of proof,  the  absence
   of evidence means that the respondents must  be  presumed  to  have  such
   ties. As neither of the first two  respondents  nor  their  children  has
   settled status in the United Kingdom, it follows that they are unable  to
   meet the eligibility requirements for leave to remain under  Appendix  FM
   of the Immigration Rules.   As  none  of  the  respondents  have  resided
   continuously in the United Kingdom for a  period  of  20  years,  or  are
   without remaining social, cultural or family  ties  to  their  respective
   countries of origin,  it  follows  that  they  are  unable  to  meet  the
   requirements for leave to remain on the  basis  of  their  private  lives
   under paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules. The evidence  does  not,
   in my judgement, reveal any compelling circumstances  that  would  render
   the respondents' removal unjustifiably  harsh  (or  disproportionate)  in
   furtherance of the legitimate aim of maintaining the economic well  being
   of  the  country  through  the  consistent  application  of   immigration
   controls. There is thus no basis for granting them discretionary leave to
   remain outside the Immigration Rules.


Decision


17. The appeal by the Secretary of State is allowed.


18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to  allow  the  appeals  against
   refusal of leave to remain and removal of the respondents from the United
   Kingdom is set aside and is substituted by a decision  to  dismiss  those
   appeals.


Anonymity is not directed.
