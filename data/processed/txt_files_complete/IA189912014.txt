For the Respondent:    Mr R Solomon, Counsel, instructed by AP Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State  I  refer  to  the
    parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant, a national of Sri  Lanka,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  dated  11th
    April 2014 refusing to issue her a residence card  as  confirmation  of
    her right to reside in the United Kingdom under the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006 (hereinafter the EEA Regulations). First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Moore allowed the appeal. The Secretary of State now appeals with
    permission to this Tribunal.

Background

 3. The background to this  case  is  that  the  Appellant  applied  for  a
    residence card as the mother-in-law of an Italian  national  exercising
    treaty  rights  in  the  UK.   The  Secretary  of  State  refused   the
    application having considered it  under  Regulation  8(2)  of  the  EEA
    Regulations as an application for  a  residence  card  as  an  extended
    family member of an EEA national under Regulation 8(1).  The  Secretary
    of State noted

         "While you have provided evidence of being an  extended  family  to
         your  EEA  Sponsor  through   birth   certificates   and   marriage
         certificates [sic]. You have not provided this department with  any
         valid evidence  that  you  are  currently  resided  with  your  EEA
         national in the United Kingdom [sic]."

 4. The Secretary of State accepted that the Appellant is  related  to  the
    EEA national as claimed but refused to issue  the  residence  card  not
    being satisfied that the Appellant had shown that she was residing with
    the EEA national upon entry to the UK and that she is  currently  still
    residing with the EEA national.

 5. In considering this appeal the First-tier Tribunal Judge heard evidence
    from the Appellant and her daughter-in-law. The oral evidence was  that
    the Appellant's daughter-in-law was an Italian national who married the
    Appellant's son on 10th August 2005 and they  have  two  children  from
    that marriage. Since September 2013 the Appellant was living  with  the
    EEA national and her husband  and  their  two  children.   The  Italian
    national  and  her  husband  had  been  providing  the  Appellant  with
    accommodation  and  financial  assistance  at  their  home.   The  oral
    evidence from  the  Italian  national  is  that  she  was  employed  in
    exercising treaty rights in the UK and this was evidenced  by  payslips
    and bank statements from Slough Borough Council.

 6. The judge found that he  was  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  provided
    credible and reliable evidence  in  demonstrating  that  she  currently
    resided with the sponsor and her son and family in the UK.   The  judge
    took account of evidence from the Appellant's GP and from the  NHS  and
    was satisfied on the basis of all of the evidence  that  the  Appellant
    lives with her son and his EEA national spouse.  The judge  noted  that
    whilst the issue of dependancy was not raised in the refusal letter  he
    was nevertheless satisfied that the Appellant is dependant on  her  son
    and the EEA national and their family in the UK and has lived with them
    for almost two years.  He was satisfied that  she  has  no  income  and
    relies on them for accommodation and financial assistance.   The  judge
    concluded that the  Appellant  meets  the  requirements  of  Regulation
    8(1)(2) of the EEA Regulations.

 7. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the judge erred in  law  by  allowing  the  appeal  outright  when  the
    Secretary of State had not considered Regulation 17(4)  which  provides
    for the exercise of discretion in issuing residence cards  to  extended
    family members.

Error of Law

 8. I firstly note that the grant of permission to appeal dated 10th August
    2015 states that there is an arguable error of law in relation  to  the
    approach taken by the judge as  to  whether  this  was  a  marriage  of
    convenience.  This appears to have no relevance to this particular case
    and may have been issued in error.  In any event, I am  satisfied  that
    there is an arguable error of law in this case and that,  although  the
    reasons for granting permission appear to not relate to the Grounds  of
    Appeal, in fact permission would have been granted in any event on  the
    basis of the Grounds.

 9. In his Rule 24 response and at the hearing Mr Solomon  submitted  that,
    having accepted that the Appellant is a dependant direct relative of an
    EEA national,  the  judge  ought  to  have  considered  the  appeal  in
    accordance with Regulation 7(1)(c) of the EEA Regulations  rather  than
    under Regulation 8.

10. Regulation 7(1)(c) provides as follows:

         "7(1)    Subject to  paragraph  (2),  for  the  purposes  of  these
                Regulations the following persons shall be treated as family
                members of another person -

                ...

                (c)    dependant direct relatives in his ascending  line  or
                that of his spouse or his civil partner;

                ..."

11. Regulation 17 (1) provides as follows:

         "17(1)   The Secretary of State must issue a residence  card  to  a
                person who is not an EEA national and is the  family  member
                of a qualified person or of an EEA national with a permanent
                right of residence under Regulation 15  on  application  and
                production of -

                (a)    a valid passport, and

                (b)    proof that the applicant is such a family member"

12. It is clear on the basis of the docuements before me that the Appellant
    made an application for a residence card as a family member.  According
    to the Reasons for Refusal letter the  Secretary  of  State  considered
    that as an application as an extended family member. However  this  was
    erroneous  and  the  application  should  have  been  considered  under
    Regulation 7 not Regulation 8.   The  judge  continued  this  error  in
    finding that the Appellant meets the requirements of Regulation 8.  The
    judge further erred at paragraph 18  in  saying  that  he  allowed  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules. There  was  no  appeal  before  him
    under the Immigration Rules.

13. However I am satisfied that these were not material errors because  the
    judge made all relevant and appropriate findings and simply  misapplied
    the relevant provisions of the EEA Regulations.  The  judge's  findings
    are sufficient to have justified a conclusion that the Appellant  meets
    the requirements of Regulation 7 and the  judge  erred  in  considering
    Regulation 8 instead of Regulation 7.  It is  clear  from  the  judge's
    findings, and conceded by the Secretary of State  in  the  Reasons  for
    Refusal letter, that the  Appellant  is  the  direct  relative  in  the
    ascending line of the EEA national's spouse. The judge found  that  the
    Appellant is dependant on the EEA national and her  spouse.   In  these
    circumstances the Appellant meets the requirements of Regulation 7  (1)
    (c) and is entitled to a residence card under  Regulation  17(1).  This
    does not require the exercise of discretion by the Secretary of  State.
    In these circumstances the correct outcome is that the appeal should be
    allowed under Regulation 7 of the EEA Regulations and the Appellant  is
    entitled to  a  residence  card  under  Regulation  17(1)  of  the  EEA
    Regulations.

Notice of Decision

14.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  discloses  no  material
