For the Respondent:    Mr A Slatter


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. On 5th July 2014 a panel of the First Tier Tribunal  (FTT)  allowed  an
    appeal by the respondent against a decision to deport him made  by  the
    Secretary of State pursuant to section 32 (5) of  the  UK  Borders  Act
    2003 on 16th January 2014.  The Secretary of State obtained  permission
    to appeal from the Upper Tribunal.  On 13th  November  2014  the  Upper
    Tribunal set aside the FTT's decision because there had been a material
    error of law.   The Upper Tribunal directed that the case should remain
    in the Upper Tribunal for a further hearing  for  the  decision  to  be
    remade.  That hearing took place before us on 11th February 2015.

Background

 2. The respondent is a national of Pakistan.  He was born on 1st  February
    1959.  According to the FTT decision  he  married  Yasmeen  Hussain,  a
    British Citizen, in Pakistan on 5th May 1987 in  an  Islamic  ceremony.
    On 10th August 1992 they were married in a civil ceremony in the United
    Kingdom.  Mrs Hussain  had  5  children  in  the  UK  from  a  previous
    marriage.  The respondent and Mrs Hussain had 2 more  children,  a  son
    born 19th January 1988 and a daughter born on 6th September  1990.   On
    19th September 1990 the respondent claimed asylum which was refused  on
    15th July 1992 with no right of  appeal.   On  5th  February  1993  the
    respondent was granted 12 months' leave to remain until February  1994.
    He was granted indefinite leave to remain on 1st July 1994.  He and his
    wife were divorced in 1995/1996, the precise date is not apparent  from
    the FTT determination.

Offences

 3. The trigger for the Deportation Order was the  respondent's  conviction
    on 5th September 2011 of conspiracy to obtain a pecuniary advantage  by
    deception for which he was sentenced on 7th October 2011 to a term of 5
    years' imprisonment.  The date of the offence  was  22nd  August  2006.
    This was the respondent's second conviction for an  offence  of  fraud.
    In 2002 he had been convicted after a trial of  conspiracy  to  defraud
    and was sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment.  There  are  links  between
    the two offences.  We take the facts from the OASys Assessment prepared
    on 11th October 2013 and from the sentencing remarks of  the  judge  on
    7th October 2011. We note there is an error as to the year of the first
    conviction.  In the judge's sentencing remarks he refers  to  2007  but
    all the evidence points to it being in 2002 (we  note,  in  particular,
    the evidence of the respondent's children about their ages at the  time
    their parents were sent to prison).

 4. In 2001 the respondent and other members of  his  family  befriended  a
    woman who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease.  They  persuaded  her
    to permit them to manage her affairs.  Over a period which is not clear
    from the record, they managed her affairs for their  own  benefit.   It
    appears that they obtained very large sums of money, possibly  as  much
    as �500,000 in total by selling her house and  withdrawing  money  from
    various bank accounts.  This  was  a  serious  offence,  involving  the
    manipulation of a very vulnerable individual who had placed  her  trust
    in the respondent.  After a trial in 2002  in  which  the  respondent's
    wife and one of his sons were co-defendants all three  were  convicted.
    The respondent's wife's conviction was later quashed  on  appeal.   The
    respondent  was  sentenced  to  5  years'  imprisonment.   Confiscation
    proceedings took place and an order was made against the respondent  in
    the sum of �150,000.  The respondent  did  not  pay  and  he  served  a
    further 2 years' imprisonment in default of payment of the confiscation
    order.  It follows  that  he  must  have  served  at  least  4�  years'
    imprisonment as a result of the first conviction and  the  confiscation
    order.

 5. What happened next can be derived from the sentencing  remarks  of  the
    judge who sentenced him in October 2011.  At the time he  was  arrested
    for the fraud set out above Mr Hussain owned 60 Lady Margaret Road, the
    family home.  Before the confiscation order was made, he granted  power
    of attorney to his daughter, who then sold the house  to  her  partner.
    The purpose of this arrangement was to put the family home  beyond  the
    reach of confiscation proceedings.  In the event, the mortgage payments
    fell into arrears and the property was repossessed by the loan company,
    'Mortgage Business'; that company put the property on the  market.   On
    18th April 2007 it was sold to Fahzaha Jaffree for the sum of �263,000.
     Ms Jaffree was a friend of the respondent's son.   She agreed,  having
    been asked by the respondent's son to buy the house, relying  on  false
    representations.  The respondent was behind this scheme to  retain  the
    family home.  Ms Jaffree claimed to be the owner of a consultancy  with
    an annual income of some �68,795.  She applied for and obtained a  loan
    of �256,500, repayable over 25 years.  The property  was  duly  bought.
    In January 2009 the respondent was arrested  along  with  his  son  for
    conspiracy to obtain a money transfer  by  deception.   The  sentencing
    judge described  the  offence  thus;  "this  was  a  deliberate  and  a
    carefully  executed  conspiracy  to  obtain  the  sum  of  �250,025  by
    deception.  The conspiracy was driven by the dishonest desire  to  hold
    onto property to which the family were not entitled.  It was fraudulent
    from the outset.  It was a single but  carefully  planned  transaction.
    One payment was made, but the mortgage of course was for  a  period  of
    some years".  When the house  was  sold,  some  of  the  proceeds  went
    towards the confiscation order.  We assume that is the sum  of  �80,000
    to which the UT referred. The fact that this offence took  place  after
    the respondent had deliberately put his house beyond the reach  of  any
    confiscation order aggravated the seriousness of the  offence,  as  did
    the fact that the respondent involved his son.   On this  occasion  the
    respondent pleaded guilty. It is right to record that in  the  end  the
    bank sustained no loss.

 6. In his letter to the Home Office of 2nd December  2011  the  respondent
    sets out in detail his working life in the UK.  He said, "I came to the
    UK in 1990 and never claimed  any  form  of  benefits  up  until  2002.
    Instead, I have made positive contributions to the  economic  wellbeing
    of this country, by starting my own business...I  ensured  the  company
    was run in  an  ethical  manner  and  I  established  positive  working
    relationships with members of the British car auction and  the  general
    public".  He omits any reference to the first conviction or the conduct
    which led up to it.  When dealing with the conviction  which  triggered
    the order for his deportation he  said  this,  "although  I  have  been
    convicted for  a  financial  crime  relating  to  my  own  assets  (our
    emphasis), I feel this may have been the consequence  of  the  guilt  I
    experienced whilst financially being unable to support my family."   He
    then goes on to say that he is sorry for his actions and that  he  will
    not commit any crime again.  The OASys Assessment,  under  the  heading
    Offence Analysis records that Mr Hussain  minimises  his  role  in  the
    second offence.  He was, in fact, the prime mover and involved two much
    younger people to assist him.

 7. We see from paragraph 7 of the findings of the FTT, the respondent gave
    evidence that in 2002 he "went to prison for mortgage fraud".  This was
    a significant understatement.  At paragraph 8 the following appears "in
    2011 he was charged with mortgage fraud over a mortgage in the name  of
    his stepson's friend.  It related  to  his  old  home  which  had  been
    repossessed and his stepson had tried to repurchase  it.   Although  he
    did not commit this offence, he pleaded guilty because  he  wanted  his
    wife and children to be left alone.   He  was  sentenced  to  5  years'
    imprisonment along with his stepson.  The property  was  then  sold  on
    behalf of the CPS and the  funds  of  �80,000  were  paid  towards  his
    outstanding confiscation order and to the mortgage lender who  made  no
    loss as a result."  The last sentence was truthful.  The rest of it was
    not.  It wholly undermines his expressions of remorse and  reveals  him
    to be untruthful when giving evidence.  We note  that  Yasser  Hussain,
    one of the respondent's sons,  said  that  the  second  conviction  was
    linked to the first conviction in relation to the mortgage.  That is  a
    phrase which was repeated in the FTT's findings.  What was  overlooked,
    however, (not least because Mr Hussain had lied about it) was the  fact
    that having committed one serious offence the respondent i)  sought  to
    put the house beyond the  reach  of  the  confiscation  order  and  ii)
    involved his son and another young woman in  obtaining  a  mortgage  so
    that the house would be retained.  We note that the  FTT  came  to  the
    conclusion "as regards the offences that they were uncharacteristic for
    the respondent".  Our analysis demonstrates the contrary.  The offences
    reveal a persistent disregard for the law and a  sustained  attempt  to
    avoid its consequences.  As a result the respondent received  two  five
    year sentences and an  additional  sentence  for  non  payment  of  the
    confiscation order.  The FTT also found that the respondent was  "truly
    remorseful".  Whilst we have no difficulty in accepting that is what he
    said at the hearing, the evidence from his conduct (and from the  OAsys
    assessment) suggests otherwise. In the opinion of the probation officer
    and in the opinion of the FTT  the  respondent  is  at  "low  risk"  of
    serious harm or reoffending.  We accept that.  We do not doubt that  he
    is sorry for his predicament but that is different from remorse.

 8. In an undated decision letter written at some point after 16th December
    2013, the Secretary of State wrote;

         "Under section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007, the  Secretary  of
         State must make  a  deportation  order  in  respect  of  a  foreign
         national who has been convicted in the United Kingdom  (UK)  of  an
         offence, who has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of  at
         least 12 months, unless the foreign national falls  within  one  of
         the exceptions set out in section 33 of that Act."...

         "Having reviewed [the documents and representations provided by the
         respondent] it has been concluded that you do not fall  within  any
         of the exceptions for automatic deportation in section 33 of the UK
         Borders Act 2007 for the reasons set out below".

 9. There then follows the background, reference to the sentencing  remarks
    of the judge, reference to the submissions received  on  23rd  November
    2011 and December 2011 in support of the respondent's Article 8  claims
    and then consideration of the respondent's position  under  ECHR.   The
    letter deals with Articles 3 and 8.  There is no  need  to  repeat  its
    contents here.  The FTT overturned the decision and decided that  there
    were "sufficient exceptional  circumstances...to  outweigh  the  public
    interest in deporting the appellant".  For that reason the tribunal did
    not consider Article 3 or Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

10. The Upper Tribunal identified an error of law in the approach taken  by
    the FTT in balancing the respondent's circumstances against the  public
    interest in deportation.   It is for us to  consider  the  matter  now.
    The Upper Tribunal preserved  those  findings  of  fact  that  had  not
    expressly been challenged.

Preliminary point

11. At the beginning  of  the  hearing  before  us,  Mr  Slatter  raised  a
    procedural issue.  In its decision of  13th  December  2014  the  Upper
    Tribunal, at paragraph 21, said "there has  been  no  cross  appeal  as
    regards the decision not to address Article 3.  We have  not  therefore
    given any active consideration to that aspect."  Mr Slatter  wished  to
    rely on Article 3, as he had before the FTT.   He  had  not  sought  to
    cross appeal because his client had  been  successful  before  the  FTT
    under the rules.   He  referred  us  to  AN  (only  loser  can  appeal)
    Afghanistan [2005] UKIAT 00097 a decision  of  the  Immigration  Appeal
    Tribunal, CMG Ockleton, Deputy President,  presiding,  which  concluded
    that a person who does not challenge the decision may not appeal on the
    basis that the decision was correct but should  have  been  reached  by
    another route.  That  is  plainly  correct.   Where  the  losing  party
    appeals the respondent may lodge a notice under Rule 24  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal Procedure Rules. It is in the Rule 24  notice  that  we  would
    expect to find reference in this case to the Article 3 argument.   Rule
    24(3)(f) requires that the notice state "the  grounds  upon  which  the
    respondent relies, including ... any grounds on  which  the  respondent
    was unsuccessful in the  proceedings  which  are  the  subject  of  the
    appeal, but intends to rely on in the appeal".   The Rule  24  response
    filed on behalf of the respondent before the Upper Tribunal in November
    2014 does not explicitly refer to Article 3.  Mr Slatter sought to rely
    on paragraph 7 which  reads  "in  light  of  the  panel's  unchallenged
    finding that the respondent is at 'real risk of suicide because of  his
    mental state if deported to Pakistan  where  he  will  be  without  any
    family support of any kind' (see paragraph 48 Determination), any error
    on a point of law in relation to the weight attributed by the panel  to
    relevant factors, was plainly  not  material  to  the  outcome  of  the
    appeal."  Mr Slatter submits that implicit in  that  paragraph  is  the
    respondent's reliance on Article 3. If that were the case it would have
    been far better to say so.  As a minimum the Upper Tribunal would  then
    have understood that this was the respondent's position.    Mr  Slatter
    then referred us to the skeleton which had formed the basis of his case
    before the FTT.   We acknowledge that Article 3 was at the forefront of
    the case before the FTT.   Mr Tufan accepted that  the  case  had  been
    conducted on that basis and did not seek to argue that he was taken  by
    surprise by the reliance on  Article  3.   In  those  circumstances  we
    permitted the respondent to argue Article 3.

The law

The Immigration Rules

12. Paragraph 396: where a person is liable to deportation the  presumption
    shall be that the public interest requires deportation.  It is  in  the
    public interest to deport where the Secretary  of  State  must  make  a
    deportation order in accordance with section 32 of the UK  Borders  Act
    2007.

    This is such a case.

    Paragraph 397:  a deportation order will not be made  if  the  person's
    removal pursuant to the order would be contrary to the UK's  obligation
    under the Refugee Convention or the  Human  Rights  Convention.   Where
    deportation would not be contrary to these obligations, it will only be
    in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation is
    outweighed.

Article 3

13. As is well known, Article 3 provides that "no-one shall be subjected to
    torture or to  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment  or  punishment".   Mr
    Slatter's submission was a simple one.   The respondent is at real risk
    of suicide if he is returned to Pakistan.  To remove  him  to  Pakistan
    therefore would be a breach of Article 3.   He relies on the finding of
    fact of the FTT at paragraph 48 "we have reached  the  conclusion  that
    the appellant is at real risk of suicide because of his mental state if
    he is deported to Pakistan where he will be without any family  support
    of any kind".   Mr Tufan did not  seek  to  challenge  that  particular
    finding but drew our attention to the evidence upon which the  Tribunal
    relied in coming to its  conclusion  namely  a  report  from  Ms  Susan
    Pagella, a psychotherapist who has an MA in education and a diploma  in
    psychiatric studies, amongst other qualifications.  She had interviewed
    the appellant on 6th June 2014 for  approximately  2  hours.   She  has
    experience of working with asylum seekers and victims of torture in her
    role as therapist. She is not a psychiatrist.   She  is  not  medically
    qualified.  She is not a psychologist.  She describes herself as having
    a clinical duty of care.  Quite what that means is not clear.   In  her
    opinion as at June 2014 she considered it "highly probable that in  the
    case of his proposed deportation being carried out, that he  would  put
    his plan of suicide into action".

14. The respondent has had depression for some years.  It appears  to  have
    begun in 2002 i.e. at about the time the first offence came  to  light.
    It was present when he committed the offence which triggered the  order
    for deportation.  The judge acknowledged it in his sentencing  remarks.
     We have reviewed all the medical records provided.   At an  assessment
    in October 2011 he said that he had seen a psychiatrist 4 months before
    (presumably for the purposes of a report  for  court).   There  is  one
    reference in the records to his having seen a psychiatrist 9 years  ago
    for depression.  That would coincide with the evidence that he began to
    suffer from depression at the time of his  first  conviction  in  2002.
    In evidence before the FTT there was reference to  his  having  seen  a
    psychiatrist.   In the last 4 years there has been  no  referral  to  a
    psychiatrist.  He takes anti depressants.  The  report  of  Ms  Pagella
    describes his appearance and we have seen him.  He looks older than his
    years.  He told her that he believes he cannot survive  psychologically
    without his children.  He also asserts he cannot  survive  without  his
    medication.  We observe that, whether he lives in Pakistan  or  the  UK
    there is no reason for him not to have his  anti  depressants.   As  to
    separation from his children the reality is that he was in  prison  for
    many of their formative years.   We accept that the effect upon them as
    young children of his first period  of  incarceration  must  have  been
    detrimental.   It is clear from their evidence to  the  FTT  that  they
    will be very saddened were he to move to Pakistan.  However, they  will
    continue in the UK to have the support of their mother who  has  always
    been their primary carer.

15. Ms Pagella opined that the respondent's  general  physical  and  mental
    health appeared poor.  This is not borne out  by  the  medical  records
    which reveal no more than a range of physical conditions often found in
    people of his age.  He apparently described to her his dilemma that  if
    he were to kill himself his children would be very stressed.   However,
    his final word on the topic seems to have been that he  would  end  his
    life straight away if he were deported because there would be no  point
    and no hope and that "this is my last decision".  Ms Pagella  concluded
    that the respondent was currently in a highly disturbed  mental  state.
    She considered that "if he were  to  be  removed  from  his  family  to
    Pakistan that he would find this unbearable and proceed  to  carry  out
    his plans to end his life".

16. We were referred to the Pakistan Country of  Origin  Information  (COI)
    Report published by the Home Office on  9  August  2013.  We  note  the
    shortage of psychiatrists in Pakistan and the high  numbers  of  people
    with depression.  The shortage of psychiatrists  is  of  very  marginal
    relevance to the respondent.  Notwithstanding his  expressed  intention
    to take his own life if deported it is not suggested by anyone that  he
    needs to see a psychiatrist.

17. Mr Slatter referred us to the decision in GS [India] and others against
    the Secretary of State for the Home  Department  2015  EWCA  (Civ)  14.
    This case does not assist him.   The Court of Appeal was concerned with
    6 appeals against decisions to remove them from the UK.   Most  of  the
    appellants were at risk of a very early death if returned to their home
    states.  Five of the six appellants were suffering from terminal  renal
    failure or end stage kidney disease.  The  sixth  was  at  an  advanced
    stage of HIV infection.  All six asserted that their removal  from  the
    UK would breach their  rights  under  Article  3  of  the  ECHR.   None
    succeeded.

18. After a comprehensive review of the domestic and Strasbourg cases  Laws
    LJ considered the decision of the European Court  of  Human  Rights  in
    Bensaid v the UK [2001] 33 EHRR 205, a case where the applicant to  the
    Strasbourg  court  had  serious  mental  health   problems,   including
    schizophrenia.  He sought to prevent removal to Algeria on the  grounds
    that it would breach his Article 3 rights.  At paragraph 37 of  Bensaid
    the Strasbourg court said:

         "The difficulties in obtaining medication and the  stress  inherent
         in returning to that part of Algeria, where there is  violence  and
         active terrorism, would,  according  to  the  applicant,  seriously
         endanger his health. Deterioration in his already  existing  mental
         illness could involve relapse  into  hallucinations  and  psychotic
         delusions involving self-harm  and  harm  to  others,  as  well  as
         restrictions in social functioning (such as withdrawal and lack  of
         motivation). The Court considers that the suffering associated with
         such a relapse could,  in  principle,  fall  within  the  scope  of
         Article 3".

19. As Laws LJ records at paragraph 40 of GS, the Strasbourg Court "accepts
    the seriousness of the applicant's medical condition.   Having  regard,
    however, to the higher threshold set by Article 3,  particularly  where
    the case does not concern the direct responsibility of the  contracting
    state for the infliction of harm, the court does not find that there is
    a  sufficiently  real  risk  that  the  applicant's  removal  in  these
    circumstances would be contrary to the standards  of  Article  3.   The
    case does not disclose the exceptional  circumstances  of  D  v  United
    Kingdom where the applicant was in  the  final  stages  of  a  terminal
    illness, Aids, and had no prospect of medical care or family support on
    expulsion to St Kitts".

20. At paragraph 41 Laws LJ sets out the way  the  Strasbourg  court  dealt
    with D v the United Kingdom 1997 24 EHRR 423.  "it  is  true  that  the
    principle [sc: the absolute nature of the Article  3  right  applicable
    "irrespective of the reprehensible nature of the conduct of the  person
    in question" -[ paragraph 47] has so far been applied by the  Court  in
    contexts in which the risk to the individual of being subject to any of
    the proscribed forms of treatment emanates from intentionally inflicted
    acts of the public authority in the receiving country or from those  of
    non-state bodies in that country when the authorities there are  unable
    to afford the appropriate protection...".



21. We derive no support for the respondent's argument from GS.  We  remind
    ourselves of the starting point, contained in the decision of the House
    of Lords in Ullah v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2004]
    UKHL 26: Lord Bingham set out the relevant test in an Article 3 foreign
    case: are there strong  grounds  for  believing  that  the  person,  if
    returned, faces a real risk of torture, inhuman or degrading  treatment
    or punishment.  As Dyson LJ said in J v Secretary of State for the Home
    Department [2005] EWCA Civ 629 a real risk "imposes  a  more  stringent
    test than merely that the risk must be more than "not fanciful." Having
    reviewed the Strasbourg cases in which the  applicants  relied  on  the
    risk of suicide (including Bensaid) the court set  out  six  principles
    that amplified the test of "real risk" in a suicide case:

        "First the test requires an assessment to be made of  the  severity
        of the treatment which it is said that the applicant  would  suffer
        if removed.  This must attain a minimum  level  of  severity.   The
        court has said on a number of occasions that the assessment of  its
        severity depends on all the circumstances of the case.  But the ill-
        treatment must "necessarily be serious" such that it is "an affront
        to fundamental humanitarian principles to remove an individual to a
        country where he is at risk of serious ill-treatment";...

        Secondly, a causal link must be shown to exist between the  act  or
        threatened act of removal or expulsion and  the  inhuman  treatment
        relied on as violating the applicant's article 3 rights.   Thus  in
        Soering at para [91], the court said:

              "In so far as any liability under the Convention is or may be
              incurred,  it  is  liability  incurred  by  the   extraditing
              Contracting State by reason of its having taken action  which
              has as a direct consequence the exposure of an individual  to
              proscribed ill-treatment." (emphasis added).

        See also para [108] of Vilvarajah where the  court  said  that  the
        examination of the article 3 issue "must focus on  the  foreseeable
        consequences of the removal of the applicants to Sri Lanka..."

        Thirdly, in the context of a foreign case, the article 3  threshold
        is particularly high simply because it is a foreign case.   And  it
        is even higher where the  alleged  inhuman  treatment  is  not  the
        direct or indirect responsibility of the public authorities of  the
        receiving state, but results from some naturally occurring illness,
        whether physical or mental.  This is made clear in para [49]  of  D
        and para [40] of Bensaid.

        Fourthly, an article 3 claim can in principle succeed in a  suicide
        case (para [37] of Bensaid).

        Fifthly, in deciding whether there is a real risk of  a  breach  of
        article 3 in a suicide case, a question of  importance  is  whether
        the applicant's fear of ill-treatment in the receiving  state  upon
        which the risk of suicide is said to be based is objectively  well-
        founded.  If the fear is not well-founded, that will tend to  weigh
        against there being a real risk that the removal will be in  breach
        of article 3.

        Sixthly, a further question of considerable  relevance  is  whether
        the removing and/or the receiving state has effective mechanisms to
        reduce the risk of suicide.  If  there  are  effective  mechanisms,
        that too will weigh  heavily  against  an  applicant's  claim  that
        removal will violate his or her article 3 rights".

22. At its highest the respondent's case is that because  he  suffers  from
    depression and has said he  will  take  his  own  life  if  removed  to
    Pakistan the removal carries with it a real risk of a breach of Article
    3.  The factual situation is very different from that of the  applicant
    in Bensaid (whose article 3 claim failed). There was  in  that  case  a
    sustained history of serious mental  disorder.   Here  the  illness  is
    treated satisfactorily with anti  depressants.   The  risk  of  suicide
    arises not because of a deterioration in the  illness  (which  has  not
    occurred and there is  no  evidence  that  it  will)  but  because  the
    respondent does not want to live in Pakistan.   There is no  allegation
    of any ill treatment in Pakistan.  If the respondent's  condition  were
    to deteriorate while he was in Pakistan he would have access to medical
    treatment.    Whilst we accept that an article 3 claim can in principle
    succeed in a suicide case we are quite  sure  that  it  cannot  succeed
    here.   The evidence does not  begin  to  satisfy  the  Ullah  test  as
    amplified in J.  We should  add  that  we  do  not  consider  that  the
    evidence, viewed as a whole, demonstrates that the respondent  will  in
    fact take his own life.   He has, as the FTT found, a  family  whom  he
    loves and who love  him.  He  acknowledges  that  they  would  be  very
    stressed were he to take his own  life.    We  dismiss  the  Article  3
    claim.

23. We return to the Immigration Rules.

24. At the time of the hearing before the FTT the rules (described then  as
    new) had come into force in July 2012.   Amended rules came into  force
    on 28th July 2014.  We set out the relevant parts of both sets of rules
    below.

The 2012 Rules

Deportation and Article 8

25. Paragraph 398:

         398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary
         to the UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
         Convention, and

         (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to  the
         public good because they have been  convicted  of  an  offence  for
         which they have been sentenced to a period of  imprisonment  of  at
         least 4 years;

         (b) ...

         (c) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to  the
         public good because, in the view of the Secretary of  State,  their
         offending has caused serious harm or they are a persistent offender
         who shows a particular disregard for the law,

         the Secretary of  State  in  assessing  that  claim  will  consider
         whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not, it  will
         only be in exceptional circumstances that the  public  interest  in
         deportation will be outweighed by other factors.

         399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c)  applies
         if -

         (a) ....

         (b) ...

         399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c)  applies
         if -(a) the person has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20
         years immediately preceding the date of  the  immigration  decision
         (discounting any  period  of  imprisonment)  and  he  has  no  ties
         (including social, cultural or family) with the country to which he
         would have to go if required to leave the UK; or (b)....

         399B. ...

    The July 2014 Rules

         Paragraph A398: These rules apply where:

         (a) a foreign  criminal  liable  to  deportation  claims  that  his
         deportation would be contrary to the United  Kingdom's  obligations
         under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention;

         Paragraph 398: where a person claims that their  deportation  would
         be contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8  of  the  Human
         Rights Convention and

      a) the deportation of the person from  the  UK  is  conducive  to  the
         public good and in the  public  interest  because  they  have  been
         convicted of an offence on which they  have  been  sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;

         ...

         the Secretary of  State  in  assessing  that  claim  will  consider
         whether paragraph 399 or 399a applies and,  if  it  does  not,  the
         public interest in deportation will only  be  outweighed  by  other
         factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
         above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

26. Paragraphs 399 and 399A apply where paragraph 398  (b)  or  (c)  apply.
    That is not the case here.  The factors included there are,  in  brief,
    family life enjoyed with children under  18  and  family  life  with  a
    partner who is a British Citizen.

27. Thus the only basis upon which the public interest in  deportation  may
    be outweighed in a case where the sentence is at least 4  years  is  if
    there are very compelling circumstances over and above the existence of
    family life with children under 18 and  family  life  with  a  partner.
    Under the rules in force at the time of the hearing before the  FTT  it
    was necessary to show "exceptional circumstances".  The  other  changes
    are not material to this case.

28. In the event the respondent does not have children under 18 nor does he
    have a partner. He and his wife are divorced although they are on  good
    terms.   The family life relied upon in this case is with his grown  up
    children and stepchildren and with his former wife.   At  paragraph  44
    the FTT found  "we  are  satisfied  that  the  appellant  continues  to
    participate in family life with his children and his  ex-wife  in  many
    significant ways".   Between 2006  and  2011  when,  it  is  said,  the
    respondent was living alone his two children  visited  him  frequently,
    often staying overnight.  The FTT describe  the  two  young  people  as
    their father's "carers".  We do not think they can be using the term in
    its technical sense (a different (step) son is  his  mother's  official
    "carer". She has a number of physical difficulties).   During the  five
    years the respondent was said to be living  on  his  own  he  was  aged
    between 46 and 51.  He did his own cooking and is said  to  be  a  very
    good cook.  His  son  said  he  needed  help  with  administration  and
    cleaning.   We note that when in prison thereafter he  is  recorded  in
    the medical notes as "going to the gym" and on another occasion he  had
    injured himself "playing football".  We accept the FTT's findings  that
    the children "are emotionally dependent on their father  to  an  extent
    that we consider goes beyond the normal emotional ties of  young  adult
    children and probably flows from  the  traumatic  experiences  of  this
    family over the past years" - those experiences were all caused by  the
    respondent.   Since 2011 the children have spent no time with him.   He
    does not wish them to visit him in detention.   They had little contact
    with him when he served four and  a  half  years  in  prison  following
    conviction in 2002.   We do not doubt that they  are  very  sad  to  be
    separated from their father and  that  he  would  be  very  sad  to  be
    separated from them.   Given their love for their father, and the  fact
    that they are in employment we think it unlikely that  were  he  to  be
    removed to Pakistan  they  would  not  maintain  contact  with  him  by
    telephone or seek to visit him from time to time.

29. We include, when considering whether there are compelling circumstances
    in this case, the evidence about the respondent's mental health.  We do
    not rehearse the detail again.  He has  depression.   We  have  already
    said that we think that if he continued to feel depressed he  would  be
    able to access medical help there.  He has said he will end his life if
    deported, notwithstanding the stress this will cause his children.   As
    we have said above, we do not consider that it  is  objectively  likely
    that he will commit suicide.  We consider he will wish to continue  his
    family life via telephone contact with his family and receiving  visits
    from them from time to time.

30. The appellant came to this country in  1990.   He  has  had  indefinite
    leave to remain since 1994.  He does not come within the description of
    a "settled migrant who has lawfully spent all or the major part of  his
    or her childhood in the country".  Within 7 years of being given ILR he
    began committing the offences described above. We  do  not  repeat  the
    detail.   Whilst  it  is  the  second  conviction  that  triggers   the
    requirement for deportation we are bound to take into account the whole
    of the offending history.  Between 2002 and the present the  respondent
    has been at liberty for between 4 and 5 years.

31. The respondent lived in Pakistan until  his  mid  thirties.   He  still
    speaks his own language comfortably (he used  interpreters  before  the
    FTT and before us) and whilst he asserted that he had no  relatives  in
    Pakistan that (if true) is not a bar to his ability to  live  and  work
    there.  He is in his mid 50s.  He has run his own business in the past.
     He is a resourceful person.

32. In our  judgment,  taking  the  evidence  as  to  the  quality  of  the
    respondent's family life at its highest it falls a very long way  short
    of constituting the  very  compelling  circumstances  required  by  the
    current rules (or the exceptional circumstances required under the 2012
    rules) to outweigh the public interest in deportation in this case.

Article 8

33. In considering and rejecting the respondent's claim under the rules  we
    have scrutinised, as required, every aspect of  his  Article  8  claim.
    The  proportionality  exercise  arises  out  of  the  requirement   for
    compelling circumstances which do not pertain here.  We cannot see that
    in those circumstances there remains open to him a free standing  claim
    under Article 8.  That is the position envisaged by paragraph 44 of the
    decision of the Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2013] Civ 1192.  Were we to  consider  such  a
    claim we would make the same findings and come to the same  conclusions
    for reasons which are obvious.  It is not for this  tribunal  to  carry
    out a sterile exercise with an inevitable outcome.

34. For all the reasons set out above we allow  the  Secretary  of  State's
    appeal. We reinstate the decision to deport the respondent.
