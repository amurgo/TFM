                         NOTICE OF ABANDONED APPEAL

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 12th January  1980.   He
    applied on 22nd December 2012 and within the  leave  of  his  visa  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 (Student) Migrant.  (He was  first  granted
    leave to enter on 1st September 2004).  That application was refused on
    2nd March 2013.  His appeal to the First Tier Tribunal  was  dismissed,
    as was his appeal for permission to appeal and the renewal  application
    to the Upper Tribunal.  Following judicial review  proceedings  and  an
    order from Master Gidden in the High Court dated  14th  February  2014,
    quashing the decision of the Upper Tribunal to refuse  permission,  the
    application for permission to appeal  was  granted  by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Ockelton on 9th January 2015.

 2. At the appeal before me there was no representation on  behalf  of  the
    appellant and he did not attend.

 3. Mr Duffy advised that the appellant had been granted leave on the basis
    of Long Residency (10  years)  and  pursuant  to  Section  104  of  the
    Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 the appeal  before  me  was
    effectively abandoned.

 4. This is a Notice to inform the parties that  the  appellant's  case  is
    treated as abandoned.

 5. The effect  of  the  appellant's  case  being  abandoned  is  that  the
    proceedings before the Upper Tribunal are at an end. There is no appeal
    before the Upper Tribunal.



Signed      Date 13th April 2015

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal Rimington
