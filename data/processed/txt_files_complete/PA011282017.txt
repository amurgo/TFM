                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction


   1. This is an appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Swaney promulgated on 6 April 2017 dismissing the  Appellant's  appeal
      against a decision of the Respondent dated 13 January 2017 refusing  a
      claim for protection.




   2. The Appellant is a citizen of  Nigeria  born  on  6  April  1984.  His
      immigration history is set out in the cover sheet of the  Respondent's
      bundle before the First-tier Tribunal,  and  at  paragraph  6  of  the
      Respondent's 'reasons for refusal'  letter  (RFRL)  dated  13  January
      2017. It is further summarised  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge at paragraphs 2-4.




   3. In such circumstances I do not repeat  the  entirety  of  the  history
      here. For present purposes, however, I note the following features  of
      the case history:


        (i) The Appellant entered the UK on 20  February  2009  with  entry
        clearance as a student valid until 30 June 2010.


        (ii) An application for further leave to remain as a Tier 4 student
        was made on 9  June  2010,  and  although  initially  refused,  and
        refused again on reconsideration, was in due course  granted  on  7
        September 2010 conferring leave until 31 May 2013.


        (iii) An application for an EEA residence card made on 24 May  2013
        was refused on 22 December 2013 on the basis that the Appellant had
        entered a sham marriage.


        (iv) A subsequent appeal against the refusal of  a  residence  card
        was dismissed on 28 October 2014, and permission to appeal  to  the
        Upper Tribunal was refused on 17 December 2014.


        (v) The Appellant was arrested on 6 February 2016 and cautioned  in
        respect of fraud; he was  also  served  with  documentation  as  an
        overstayer.


        (vi) On 10 February 2016 the Appellant made a human  rights  claim,
        which was refused with an out-of-country  right  of  appeal  on  19
        February 2016.


        (vii) The Appellant was detained upon reporting on 7 July 2016.


        (viii) On 25 July 2016 the Appellant applied for asylum.


        (ix) A substantive asylum interview was conducted on  28  September
        2016. The asylum claim was based on the Appellant's  sexuality;  he
        claimed to be bisexual. During  the  course  of  the  interview  he
        claimed currently to be in a relationship with  a  woman,  Ms  Amee
        Bishop, but not to be cohabiting with her (questions 51-59, and see
        also questions 228-230). He claimed to be a "Christian  by  birth",
        but could not remember the last time he had  attended  church,  and
        described  himself  as   "not   really   practising   Christianity"
        (questions 154-156). He also indicated that he had not worked since
        2014 (question 48).




   4. The application for asylum was  refused  by  the  Respondent  for  the
      reasons set out in the RFRL: in essence the Respondent did not  accept
      the Appellant's claim in  any  material  respect  -  specifically  his
      claimed sexuality was rejected, as was his claim to have been arrested
      and tortured in Nigeria. The Respondent also considered  human  rights
      grounds with reference to Article 8 private and family life, but found
      that the Appellant did not satisfy the requirements of the Immigration
      Rules and that there were  no  exceptional  circumstances  to  warrant
      departure from the Rules.




   5. The Appellant appealed to the IAC. His appeal was  dismissed  on  both
      protection grounds and human rights grounds for reasons set out in the
      Decision and Reasons of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Swaney  promulgated
      on 6 April 2017.




   6. The Appellant sought permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.  In
      the first instance he raised grounds of challenge in respect  of  both
      the dismissal of his protection claim  and  his  human  rights  claim.
      Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly on
      3 May 2017, but limited to only some of the human  rights  grounds  of
      challenge. Permission to appeal was not  granted  in  respect  of  the
      challenge to the dismissal of the protection claim.




   7. The Appellant, being not entirely satisfied with the limited basis  of
      the grant  of  permission  to  appeal,  renewed  his  application  for
      permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.  In  doing  so  he  only
      pursued challenge in respect of the human rights grounds in respect of
      which Judge Kelly  had  refused  permission;  he  did  not  renew  the
      protection claim grounds. On 31 May 2017 Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Smith
      granted further permission to appeal in respect of the remaining human
      rights grounds, observing that Judge Kelly had appeared to reject such
      grounds on the basis that they were contingent upon the success of the
      other human rights grounds, and that such reasoning  did  not  justify
      refusing permission to appeal.



Consideration of 'error of law'

   8. At the core of the Appellant's case as it is now  pursued  before  the
      Upper Tribunal is his claim to be in a parental relationship with  his
      partner's child. The First-tier Tribunal Judge rejected the submission
      made before her in this regard: "I do not accept on the basis  of  the
      evidence before me that he has stepped into the shoes of a  parent.  I
      find that he does not have a parental relationship with his  partner's
      child for the purposes of section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act"  (paragraph
      61).




   9. The Appellant's primary basis  of  challenge  in  this  regard  is  an
      assertion that the Respondent's representative conceded that there was
      a genuine parental relationship, and a submission that the  Judge  was
      in error in not accepting such a concession. Further or  alternatively
      it is argued that the Judge was in any event in error in finding  that
      a parental relationship did not exist.




  10. For the reasons set out below, I reject both the  primary  submission,
      and the alternative argument. I am unable  to  identify,  and  do  not
      accept, that any such concession was made  by  or  on  behalf  of  the
      Respondent. Even if it were otherwise the Judge  was  not  obliged  to
      accept such a concession, and  has  in  any  event  set  out  entirely
      sustainable reasons for her conclusion  that  there  was  no  parental
      relationship.




  11. The residual grounds - that the Judge  failed  to  undertake  a  'best
      interests' assessment in respect  of  the  child,  and  erred  in  not
      recognising that the Zambrano principle was applicable - are, as  both
      Judge Kelly and Judge Smith recognised, contingent upon the success of
      one or other of the first two grounds. Given that I have rejected  the
      first two grounds it is not necessary to go on to consider  the  third
      and fourth grounds - and indeed, for the avoidance  of  any  doubt,  I
      conclude that in light of her sustainable conclusions  in  respect  of
      parental relationship there was no error on the part of the  Judge  in
      respect of either 'best interests' or Zambrano.




  12. The Appellant's grounds at paragraphs 12 and 14 assert the following:


        "13. Furthermore,  at  the  hearing,  it  was  submitted  that  the
        appellant was a qualifying parent within  Section  117B(b)  of  the
        Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.


        14. The Judge specifically asked  the  presenting  officer  if  she
        agreed to this, to which she replied in the affirmative."




  13. The reference to 'Section 117B(b)' is in context clearly  intended  to
      be a reference to section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act. However,  there  is
      no such creature as a 'qualifying parent'  identified  therein.  There
      is, however, reference to  a  'qualifying  child',  which  is  further
      defined at section 117D(1).  Judge  Swaney's  record  of  proceedings,
      which is a matter of record on file and the relevant contents of which
      I drew to the representatives' attention at the hearing,  records  the
      Judge asking the Presenting Officer in the course of  submissions  "Is
      he qualifying child", to which the Presenting Officer is  recorded  as
      replying "Yes".




  14. It seems  to  me  absolutely  clear  that  the  Appellant  and/or  his
      representative has misunderstood the  nature  of  this  exchange.  The
      enquiry, and the concession, were in respect  of  the  status  of  the
      child and were not in  respect  of  the  nature  of  the  relationship
      between the child and the Appellant. Nothing further  is  advanced  by
      the Appellant by way of supporting evidence of the  assertion  that  a
      concession was made by the Respondent; the Respondent  denies  that  a
      concession was made in the Rule 24 response dated 24 May 2017.




  15. In all such circumstances I find that the Respondent at no point  made
      a  concession  to  the  effect  that  the  Appellant  had  a  parental
      relationship with his partner's child, and accordingly and necessarily
      I reject the notion that the Judge 'went behind' such a concession.




  16. The Appellant's alternative submission is in my judgement in substance
      an attempt to reargue the issue of parental relationship. In effect it
      is said that the findings of the Judge in respect of the nature of the
      relationship between the Appellant and his partner's child  were  such
      that she should have concluded  that  there  was  a  genuine  parental
      relationship. I do not accept that argument either as  identifying  an
      error of law, or otherwise being of factual merit.




  17. In this context the Appellant emphasises in particular  the  following
      aspects of the Judge's  findings:  "the  appellant  is  in  a  genuine
      relationship with Amy  Bishop"  (paragraph  51);  "the  appellant  has
      established a relationship with his partner's son" (paragraph 52).




  18. It is also pleaded in the Grounds, and amplified  before  me  in  oral
      submissions, that the Judge ignored  case  law  and  guidance  on  the
      meaning of parental relationship.




  19. Additionally Mr Decker has urged  upon  me  consideration  of  factual
      elements of the case in respect of financial support  and  involvement
      in the child's christening. Indeed it is  said  that  apart  from  the
      christening there have not really been any  significant  decisions  in
      the child's life of the sort that involvement in which  might  provide
      evidence of a parental role. For the main part it seems to me that  in
      pressing  these  arguments  Mr  Decker  was  largely  redeploying  the
      submissions before the First-tier Tribunal, or  otherwise  seeking  to
      reargue the case on its merits in an attempt to persuade me to reverse
      the findings of the Judge and not raising arguments of  any  error  of
      law. Accordingly, in so far as the Appellant must base  his  arguments
      in respect of error  of  law  on  the  foundation  of  the  favourable
      findings of the Judge, he is essentially left with  the  two  findings
      identified at paragraph 17 above.




  20. The Appellant's core submission, therefore, really comes down  to  the
      this: it is argued that because the Judge found that the Appellant had
      established a relationship with his partner's  son  she  should  as  a
      matter of course have concluded that it was a  parental  relationship.
      Plainly that submission is illogical: an  adult  relationship  with  a
      child is not inevitably a parental relationship even if the  adult  is
      in a relationship with one of  the  child's  natural  parents.  In  my
      judgement the Judge went on to explain clearly why she concluded  that
      the relationship that existed between the Appellant and his  partner's
      son could not be characterised as a parental relationship.




  21. The Judge's key reasoning is to be found  at  paragraph  61.  After  a
      careful and thorough review of the evidence and applicable law in  the
      preceding paragraphs (paragraphs 51-60), the Judge states this:


        "Although I accept the appellant attends medical appointments  with
        his partner's son, there was no evidence that he plays any role  in
        making decisions about what care or treatment the  child  receives.
        While I accept the  appellant  plays  a  role  in  caring  for  his
        partner's son, there was no evidence to suggest the appellant plays
        a role in making decisions about his physical  or  emotional  needs
        either independently or jointly with his  partner.  The  extent  to
        which the  appellant  is  making  an  active  contribution  to  his
        partner's son's life was not clear. I note the evidence of  bonding
        between the appellant and  his  partner  son,  but  note  that  the
        appellant's partner's aunt also lives with them and  is  likely  to
        have also bonded with the child and to play a similar role  in  the
        child's life as the appellant. I find the appellant is one  of  the
        adults who cares for the child, but I do not accept on the basis of
        the evidence before me that he has stepped  into  the  shoes  of  a
        parent. I find that he does not have a parental  relationship  with
        his partner's child..."




  22. In short, the Judge concluded that the Appellant was involved  in  the
      child's life on the basis that he was the  boyfriend  of  the  child's
      mother and was presently living in the same household,  but  that  the
      evidence did not support the contention that his role  had  assumed  a
      parental nature. That was a conclusion entirely open to the Judge  and
      one that I consider she adequately and sustainably reasoned.




  23. I do not accept that the Judge  failed  to  have  regard  to  relevant
      evidence. In my judgement she  plainly  gave  consideration  to  those
      aspects of the case presented by  the  Appellant  in  support  of  his
      assertion to be in a parental relationship with his  partner's  child.
      Indeed in some respects she  accepted  the  evidence  presented  as  a
      matter  of  primary  fact.  For  example:  she  accepted  photographic
      evidence showed the Appellant with the child at various points in  his
      life (paragraph 52); she noted that  the  GP  had  observed  signs  of
      bonding (paragraph 52, and also see paragraph 60); she  accepted  that
      the Appellant played a role in caring for the  child  (paragraph  61).
      The real point of departure between the Judge  and  the  Appellant  is
      that the Judge did not consider that such primary facts constituted  a
      parental relationship. Ultimately, in my judgement that  was  a  mixed
      question of fact and law for the Judge, and  the  Appellant  disagrees
      with her conclusion. I am not satisfied, however, that in articulating
      the disagreement the Appellant has identified any error of law.




  24. As regards the applicable law I do not accept that the  Judge  in  any
      way misdirected herself. I note in particular that  the  Judge  stated
      that she did not accept that the Appellant has "stepped into the shoes
      of a parent" (paragraph 61).  In  my  judgement  this  was  clearly  a
      conscious echo of the words used in R. (on the application  of  RK)  v
      Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  (s.  117B(6);  "parental
      relationship") IJR [2016] UKUT 00031 (IAC) - see at paragraphs 38  and
      43 , and at paragraph 2 of the headnote  -  to  which  the  Judge  was
      directed  by  the  Appellant's  representative,  and  which  she  duly
      analysed at paragraph 58. There is nothing to suggest that  the  Judge
      misunderstood this case, and everything to suggest  that  she  applied
      its principles to the facts as she found them. It is to be noted  that
      RK involves detailed and careful  consideration  of  the  Respondent's
      guidance in  respect  of  parental  relationships,  and  again  I  can
      identify nothing in the decision of Judge Swaney to suggest  that  she
      disregarded such guidance or reached a conclusion wholly  incompatible
      with such guidance and/or not open to her on the facts and evidence.




  25. In all such circumstances I reject the Appellant's  challenge  to  the
      decision of the First-tier Tribunal.




  26. That really  brings  the  challenge  to  a  conclusion.  However,  for
      completeness, and in deference to some of the submissions  pursued  in
      respect of the merits before me, I consider it helpful and appropriate
      to make the following observations.


        (i) At the date of the asylum interview, just over 5 months  before
        the appeal hearing before Judge Swaney, the Appellant  stated  that
        he was not living with Ms Bishop. Before the First-tier Tribunal Ms
        Bishop suggested that the couple had been cohabiting for one  year,
        whereas the Appellant gave an estimate of 6 months, suggesting that
        perhaps Ms Bishop had included a period during which he would  from
        time to time stay at her home. Be that as it may, at its  best,  on
        his own evidence the Appellant had only been  cohabiting  with  his
        partner - and thereby only living in  the  same  household  as  her
        child - for a period of no more than 6 months by the  date  of  the
        hearing before Judge Swaney.


        (ii) I note that in the  context  of  European  Community  law  the
        concept of a 'durable relationship' between a couple is  ordinarily
        premised on establishing that they have been living together  in  a
        relationship akin to marriage  for  two  years.  Whilst  I  do  not
        suggest that the concept of a durable relationship with  a  partner
        is congruent with establishing a  parental  relationship  with  the
        same partner's child, nonetheless it seems  to  me  that  it  might
        reasonably require quite cogent and/or compelling evidence to  show
        that a parental relationship has formed with the partner's child in
        a  shorter  timeframe  than  it  takes  to  demonstrate  a  durable
        relationship with the child's natural parent.


        (iii) The Appellant has asserted as an example of  his  involvement
        in an  important  decision  relating  to  the  child,  the  child's
        christening. The Grounds of Appeal, for  example,  plead  that  the
        Appellant and his partner both agreed a date which was subsequently
        postponed until the Appellant was released  from  detention.  There
        was no supporting evidence of this claimed circumstance before  the
        First-tier Tribunal, although the  Appellant  has  now  produced  a
        letter dated 7 May 2017 from the vicar of his church which mentions
        that the child was recently baptised: the letter is  silent  as  to
        the Appellant's involvement with the decision that the child should
        be baptised. However, in any event, it seems to me that arranging a
        date upon which the Appellant could attend a christening is not  in
        itself evidence of his involvement in a  decision  that  the  child
        should be christened. In this  context  I  remind  myself  that  at
        interview the Appellant stated that he did not consider himself  to
        be a practising Christian. The reasonable inference to be drawn  is
        that it was a decision of the mother that there be  a  christening,
        albeit that she wished her partner to be able  to  attend  such  an
        event. I am not satisfied that there is anything in  the  available
        evidence,  or  further  to  the  submissions  of  Mr  Decker,  that
        establishes the Appellant was  involved  in  a  decision  that  his
        partner's child should be christened.


        (iv) The Appellant made an application to adduce further  evidence.
        In addition to the letter from the vicar of the Appellant's church,
        the evidence related  to  his  claimed  financial  support  of  his
        partner and  her  child,  and  was  by  way  of  a  bank  statement
        purportedly showing payments variously in favour of Ms  Bishop  and
        her son over the period 27 February 2017 to 19  May  2017.  Similar
        evidence was before the first-tier Tribunal covering the  period  8
        March 2016 to 7 February 2017.


        (v) For my own part I do not consider that the  extracts  from  the
        bank statements - either by way  of  those  before  the  First-tier
        Tribunal, or those it is now sought  to  adduce  before  the  Upper
        Tribunal - provide reliable evidence  of  the  assertion  that  the
        Appellant is genuinely making a financial contribution towards  his
        partner and her child. The statements have been printed in  such  a
        way as to disclose only such payments as  the  Appellant  seeks  to
        rely upon: this is evident from  a  consideration  of  the  balance
        figure  which  fluctuates  independently  of   the   sum   of   the
        transactions shown. (In this context it is apparent that the online
        statement in respect of an  internet  banking  account  contains  a
        'Filter transactions' option that permits the user to  view  -  and
        also therefore print - only particular transactions.) The Appellant
        has, in effect,  chosen  not  to  make  full  and  frank  financial
        disclosure: as such it is impossible to see the source of the funds
        in his account. I remind myself that he claimed at  interview  that
        he had not worked since 2014, yet the sums that he claims  to  have
        been genuine financial contributions amount to over  �1800  between
        27 February and 19 May 2017 (i.e. on average  more  than  �150  per
        week). Mr Decker suggests that the Appellant  was  able  to  source
        such funds from  savings  and  from  financial  contributions  from
        others. There is no evidence  of  any  such  savings  or  financial
        contributions.


        (vi) It is to be recalled that the Judge found the Appellant "to be
        a largely incredible witness" (paragraph  37),  observing  that  he
        "has on two occasions made applications to  remain  in  the  United
        Kingdom on the basis of relationships with women  which  have  been
        found to be a sham... [and] he was  cautioned  for  an  offence  of
        using a fraudulent document" (paragraph 38), and  also  found  that
        the Appellant had fabricated his asylum claim (paragraph 50) and in
        so doing had presented documents that were not  genuine  (paragraph
        46). In  such  circumstances  without  more  by  way  of  financial
        disclosure, I do not consider that  any  reasonable  decision-maker
        should  accept  that  the   Appellant   makes   genuine   financial
        contributions to his partner and her child from his own funds based
        essentially only on his assertion to this effect and 'edited'  bank
        statements.


        (vii)  For  completeness  I  note  that  the  level  of   financial
        contribution shown in the statements before the First-tier Tribunal
        was considerably less than that shown in the evidence sought to  be
        adduced before the Upper  Tribunal.  Payments  identifiable  to  Ms
        Bishop over a period of 11  months  approximate  to  �2400  -  i.e.
        something of the order of �50 per week on average - although it  is
        unclear why such payments were being made even at a time  prior  to
        cohabitation.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  appears  to   have
        accepted the fact that there was some financial  contribution  from
        the  Appellant   uncritically,   but   nonetheless   determined   -
        sustainably for the reasons I have already given - that  there  was
        no parental relationship with Ms Bishop's child. Indeed,  it  seems
        to me that in circumstances where the Appellant was by the date  of
        the hearing before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  cohabiting  with  Ms
        Bishop small financial  contributions,  if  indeed  any  were  made
        genuinely originating from the Appellant, may be understandable  in
        the context of sharing household expenses, and are not  a  reliable
        or significant indicator of parental responsibility in  respect  of
        her child.




  27. Be that as it may, for the reasons  already  given,  and  in  all  the
      circumstances I do not identify any error of law in  the  approach  of
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge.




NOTICE OF DECISION


  28. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained no error of law  and
      stands. The Appellant's appeal remains dismissed.
