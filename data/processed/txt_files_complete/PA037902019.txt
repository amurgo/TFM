                          DECISION AND REASONS (P)


   1. The Appellant is a national of Iraq born in 1993.  He seeks protection
      in the United Kingdom.   An anonymity order is in force.




      Case History

   2. The material history of this matter in the Tribunal is as follows

      12 June 2019      First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Forster  dismisses  the
                       Appellant's appeal on  human  rights  and  protection
                       grounds

      10 September 2019      The Appellant is granted permission  to  appeal
                       to the Upper Tribunal by Upper Tribunal Judge Owens

      25th October 2019      The matter comes before me at Manchester  Civil
                       Justice Centre. I find error of law in the First-tier
                       Tribunal's approach and set the decision aside in its
                       entirety. The 'remaking' of the appeal  is  adjourned
                       pending the new country guidance on Iraq.  A copy  of
                       my 'error of law' decision is appended.

      20th December 2019     The decision in SMO, KSP & IM  (Article  15(c);
                       identity documents) Iraq CG [2019] UKUT  00400  (IAC)
                       is published. (an administrative  error  leads  to  a
                       delay in listing)

      2nd April 2020   Upper Tribunal Judge Reeds  gave  Directions  to  the
                       parties re disposal

      20 April 2020    Hearing scheduled for  this  date  adjourned  due  to
                       Covid-19 pandemic

      21st April 2020  The Appellant's representatives indicated  that  they
                       considered an oral hearing to  be  necessary  in  the
                       interests of justice

      5th June 2020    I sent further directions to the parties  asking  the
                       Appellant to clarify the matters in issue (see below)

      19th June 2020   Directions amended[1]

      22nd June 2020   Appellant's solicitors indicate that they  no  longer
                       require an oral hearing, and that they are content to
                       narrow the scope of the appeal so as to rely  on  the
                       findings of the Tribunal in SMO

      29th June 2020   Further directions (see below)

      15th July 2020   Secretary of State (by Senior Presenting  Officer  Ms
                       Isherwood)  makes  further  written  submissions   in
                       response to  my  directions,  addressing  the  issues
                       arising from the decision in SMO.



Decision on Rule 34: Hearing

   3. Rule 34 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 provides
      that the Upper Tribunal may make any decision without a hearing.    It
      further provides that the  Tribunal  must  have  regard  to  any  view
      expressed by the parties when deciding  whether  to  proceed  on  that
      basis.

   4. Both parties have now had an opportunity to request at  oral  hearing,
      but at this stage neither does so. Having considered my directions  of
      the 5th June (amended  19th  June)  the  Appellant  has  narrowed  his
      grounds of appeal to the extent that the appeal may now be  determined
      solely having regard to a) matters of fact as found by the  First-tier
      Tribunal or otherwise uncontested by the Respondent  and  b)  applying
      those facts to the country guidance given  in  SMO.   There  would  in
      those circumstances be little utility  in  an  oral  hearing.  I  have
      further had regard to the overriding objective in the Procedure  Rules
      and to the fact that there has already been some delay in  this  case.
      Having considered all of those matters I am satisfied that it would be
      in the interests of justice for the decision  in  this  appeal  to  be
      remade on the papers and submissions before me.




      The Remade Decision

   5. As matters stood on the 25th October 2019 the  Appellant  pursued  his
      case on two grounds.

   6. First, he contended that he had a well-founded fear of persecution for
      reasons of his membership of 'particular social group' ie his  family.
      This claim related to  a  claimed  blood  feud  with  members  of  his
      extended family living in Halabja.  The Appellant no longer wishes  to
      pursue this aspect of his claim.

   7. Second, the Appellant submitted that his removal would be contrary  to
      the United Kingdom's obligations under Article 15 of the Qualification
      Directive.  As I noted in my Directions of  the  5th  June  2020,  the
      ground upon which this submission was  built  has  shifted  under  the
      Appellant's feet. In October 2019 the operative country  guidance  was
      AA (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2015] UKUT 00544 (IAC).  The Appellant had
      relied upon that decision to submit that he could not be  returned  to
      his home area of Tuz Khurmato because  that  was  a  'contested  area'
      where conditions on the ground were such that there was a real risk of
      civilians  suffering  indiscriminate  violence  by  virtue  of   their
      presence there. The  Appellant  had  relied  on  that,  and  upon  the
      decision in AAH (Kurds - internal  relocation)  Iraq  CG  [2018]  UKUT
      00212 (IAC), to submit  that  there  was  not  a  reasonable  internal
      relocation alternative for  him,  an  undocumented  Kurdish  man.   In
      December 2019 the Tribunal issued fresh country guidance in  the  case
      of SMO.  In SMO it  was  found  that  although  Tuz  Khurmato  remains
      somewhat unstable, after the military defeat of ISIS conditions on the
      ground are not such that Article 15(c) is engaged. The  Appellant  can
      therefore  no  longer  contend  that  he  qualifies  for  humanitarian
      protection on this basis. SMO did however open up another possibility.

   8. The Tribunal gave guidance on an entirely new factual matrix in Iraq -
      the introduction of new  biometric  identity  cards  known  as  'Iraqi
      National Identity Cards' (INIDs), set to replace the current system of
      'Civil Status Identity Documents' (CSIDs). Whether or not an appellant
      can obtain one of these cards within a reasonable time of  arrival  in
      Iraq is today relevant to the question of  whether  he  qualifies  for
      humanitarian protection  under  Article  15(b)  of  the  Qualification
      Directive.  If he cannot, and cannot access support  in  another  way,
      then it is accepted that his living conditions may fall below a  level
      acceptable in humanitarian terms: the risk of destitution is such that
      Article 15(b)/ Article 3 ECHR would  be  engaged  [see  paragraph  317
      SMO].  It is upon these findings that  the  Appellant  now  rests  his
      case.

   9. The only firm factual foundation that I  have  in  this  case  is  the
      apparently uncontested evidence that the Appellant is a Kurd  who  has
      lived in Tuz Khurmato since he was a child.  For the  purpose  of  the
      remade decision the material  matters  in  issue  are  whether  it  is
      reasonably likely that the Appellant:

        a) Has no family members to whom he could turn in Iraq;

        b) Will be returning to Iraq undocumented;

        c) Will remain undocumented for an unacceptably long  period  after
           his arrival.

  10. In making my findings I have had regard to the country guidance  cases
      SMO, AA and AAH, and where relevant I have set out  specific  passages
      herein. I have read the Appellant's evidence in the context  of  those
      authoritative decisions, bearing in mind that the burden of proof lies
      on him.  The standard of  proof  is  lower  than  the  ordinary  civil
      standard: it is for the Appellant to demonstrate that there is a  real
      risk that he will face conditions amounting to  a  breach  of  Article
      15(b) if returned to Iraq.

  11. The Appellant's home area of Tuz Khurmato is in  Iraq  proper,  so  as
      matters stand it is the Respondent's intention to remove the Appellant
      to Baghdad. Although not directly relevant to the question of  risk  I
      begin by considering how that removal will be effected: what  document
      will he travel on?

  12. I am satisfied that the Appellant is not in  possession  of  an  Iraqi
      passport. When he left Iraq in 2018 he was a labourer  who  had  never
      before left the country. He came from an area accepted  to  have  been
      heavily contested, and occupied by ISIL fighters. He made the  journey
      with the assistance of people smugglers.  In  those  circumstances  it
      seems to me extremely unlikely that he would ever have had a passport.

  13. I am satisfied that the Appellant is not currently in possession of  a
      CSID, nor indeed an 'Iraqi National Card' (INC).  He  arrived  in  the
      United Kingdom in the back  of  a  lorry  and  was  on  the  same  day
      interviewed at Swinton Police Station. He had no  documents  with  him
      that day. I note that the Respondent appears to have proceeded, in the
      refusal letter, on the basis that this  was  the  case.  It  was  also
      accepted by the First-tier Tribunal, which noted  that  the  Appellant
      would have  been  well  aware  that  a  lack  of  documentation  could
      frustrate removal. In  those  circumstances  it  seems  to  me  to  be
      extremely unlikely that the Appellant would have brought his  CSID  or
      INC with him from Iraq.

  14. I am nevertheless satisfied that in the absence of either  a  passport
      or a CSID the Appellant's removal will be  facilitated  by  the  Iraqi
      Consulate in London co-operating with the Secretary of State to  issue
      the Appellant with a Laissez-Passer.   The decision  in  SMO  outlines
      how this process works, and neither party has given me  any  cause  to
      doubt that such documentation would be issued  upon  request  in  this
      case. I can therefore be satisfied that the Appellant will  arrive  in
      Baghdad with a Laissez-Passer.

  15. It is no part of the Respondent's case that  the  Appellant  could  be
      expected to remain in Baghdad, a city with which he no connection;  he
      has no  contacts  there,  is  undocumented  and  does  not  speak  the
      language. Having arrived in Baghdad the Appellant would therefore need
      to make his way from the airport to Tuz Khurmato. In AAH the  Tribunal
      accepted the evidence of Dr Fatah (and other sources)  to  the  effect
      that there are at least  two  checkpoints  on  the  road  out  of  the
      airport, and numerous others at regular intervals on every main  route
      in the country. There will certainly be a  good  number  on  any  road
      leading into what was until recently contested territory.  Before  the
      Tribunal in SMO Dr Fatah reiterated the evidence that he had given  in
      AAH: a traveller would be required to produce  identity  documentation
      at each of these checkpoints, and if he could not do so, he  would  be
      held in detention by the soldiers - or militia -  manning  that  post.
      What documentation might suffice has been the subject of some  debate.
      In AAH the Secretary of State appeared to accept that only a  CSID  or
      valid Iraqi passport would do;  very shortly after that  decision  was
      promulgated new evidence came to light indicating that in fact it  may
      be  possible  for  returnees  to   use   their   Laissez-Passers,   or
      alternatively a 'pass' letter issued to them on arrival.  In  SMO  the
      Tribunal robustly rejected those suggestions:

        "12. A Laissez Passer will be of no assistance in the absence of  a
        CSID or an INID; it is confiscated upon arrival and is not, in  any
        event, a  recognised  identity  document.   There  is  insufficient
        evidence to show that returnees are issued  with  a  'certification
        letter' at Baghdad Airport, or to show that any such document would
        be recognised internally as acceptable proof of identity."

  16. What then, could the Appellant do to get home?

  17. He could try and obtain a CSID from the Iraqi embassy in London before
      he left. In SMO the Tribunal referred  back  to  the  earlier  country
      guidance on the point [at �383]:

        "We have not been asked to revisit the extant country  guidance  on
        the way in which an individual might obtain a replacement CSID from
        within the UK, for which see [173]-[177] of AA (Iraq) and  [26]  of
        AAH (Iraq).  We add only this: whilst the INID is clearly replacing
        the CSID in Iraq, consulates do not have the  electronic  terminals
        necessary to issue the INID and continue to issue the CSID instead,
        as confirmed in a Canadian Immigration  and  Refugee  Board  report
        which is quoted at 5.6.9 of the respondent's CPIN entitled Internal
        Relocation, civil documentation and returns, dated  February  2019.
        An Iraqi national in the UK would be able to apply for  a  CSID  in
        the way explained  in  AA  (Iraq)  and,  if  one  was  successfully
        obtained, we find that it  would  be  acceptable  evidence  of  the
        individual's identity throughout Iraq.  Notwithstanding the plan to
        replace the old CSID system with the INID by the end  of  2019,  we
        accept what was said by EASO (in  February  2019)  and  the  Danish
        Immigration  Service  and  Landinfo  (in   November   2018),   that
        implementation was delayed and that the CSID was still  being  used
        in Iraq, and that it continues to be issued in those parts  of  the
        country in which the INID  terminals  have  not  been  rolled  out.
        Given this evidence, and the fact that the CSID has been a  feature
        of Iraqi society for so long, we do not accept that there will come
        a time at the end of this year when the CSID suddenly ceases to  be
        acceptable as proof of identity."

  18. Whilst the Tribunal in this passage clearly envisage that  it  remains
      possible to obtain a new CSID in London, the  question  is  of  course
      whether it is reasonably likely that an applicant will be unable to do
      so.   The likelihood of an individual application succeeding  must  be
      assessed in light of the evidence, in particular the  accepted  expert
      opinion of Dr Fatah on the matter. The passages in  AA  to  which  the
      Tribunal in SMO refer are these:

        "173. As regards  those  who  have  an  expired  or  current  Iraqi
        passport but no CSID - Dr Fatah identifies in his first report that
        a CSID may be obtained through the "Consular section of  the  Iraqi
        Embassy in London", which will send a request for a replacement  or
        renewed CSID to the General Directorate for Travel and  Nationality
        - Directorate of Civil Status. A request  for  a  replacement  CSID
        must be accompanied, inter alia, by "any form of official  document
        in support of the applicant's identity" and  the  application  form
        must be signed by "the head of the family, or the legal guardian or
        representative to verify the truth of its contents." He also  added
        that an applicant must also authorise a person in Iraq  to  act  as
        his representative in order for that person to "follow  up  on  the
        progress of the application".

        174.  However,  Dr  Fatah  continued  by  explaining  that  if   an
        individual has lost his CSID and does not know  the  relevant  page
        and book number for it, then the Iraq Embassy in London will not be
        able to obtain one on his behalf. Instead, he or she will  have  to
        attend the appropriate local office of family registration in  Iraq
        or give a relative, friend or lawyer power of  attorney  to  obtain
        his or her CSID. The process of a giving power  of  attorney  to  a
        lawyer in Iraq to act "as a proxy" is commonplace and Dr Fatah  had
        done this himself. He also explained that  the  power  of  attorney
        could be obtained through the Iraq Embassy.

        175. Dr Fatah gave further evidence to the  effect  that  having  a
        marriage certificate may be useful as it would contain  data  found
        in the family records. It  is,  however,  not  possible  to  use  a
        "health card" in order to obtain a CSID because there is no primary
        health care or GP system in Iraq,  but  instead  patients  attended
        hospital when they needed to do so and no central records are held.



        176. There is a consensus  between  Dr  Fatah's  evidence  and  the
        following more general evidence provided  by  UNHCR-Iraq  in  April
        2015 on the issue of obtaining CSID's from abroad. "In principle, a
        failed asylum seeker, or  indeed  any  Iraqi  citizen  abroad,  can
        acquire Iraqi documents through  Iraqi  embassies  and  consulates.
        There is a special authorization granted to these bodies to provide
        documents for Iraqi abroad on the condition that the  beneficiaries
        should have  any  available  documents  in  order  to  prove  their
        nationality."

        177. In summary, we conclude that  it  is  possible  for  an  Iraqi
        national living in the UK to obtain a  CSID  through  the  consular
        section of the Iraqi Embassy in London, if such a person is able to
        produce a current or expired passport  and/or  the  book  and  page
        number for their family registration details. For  persons  without
        such a passport, or who are unable to produce the  relevant  family
        registration details, a  power  of  attorney  can  be  provided  to
        someone in  Iraq  who  can  thereafter  undertake  the  process  of
        obtaining the CSID for such person from the  Civil  Status  Affairs
        Office in their home governorate. For  reasons  identified  in  the
        section that follows below, at the  present  time  the  process  of
        obtaining a CSID from Iraq is likely to be severely hampered if the
        person wishing to obtain the CSID is from  an  area  where  Article
        15(c) serious harm is occurring."

  19. That was the evidence in 2015. In 2018 Dr Fatah  updated  it  for  the
      Tribunal in AAH:

        "26. If applying through a consulate abroad  the  requirements  are
        different. Having contacted the consulate in London, and checked on
        the website of the Iraqi embassy in Sweden, Dr  Fatah  states  that
        the  authorities  will  require  the  applicant  to  first  make  a
        statement explaining why he needs a CSID and  attach  this  to  his
        application form, which must  countersigned  by  the  head  of  the
        applicant's family and stamped by the consulate or embassy; he must
        then produce his Iraqi passport and proof of status in the  country
        where he is applying, the name of a representative (proxy) in Iraq,
        an additional form completed by the head of the applicant's  family
        verifying that the contents of his application form were true, four
        colour copies of his INC, and 10 colour photographs. Crucially  the
        applicant must be able to produce something which can establish the
        location of his family's details in the civil register. This should
        be a CSID, an INC or  birth  certificate.  If  none  of  these  are
        available to the applicant he must supply the identity documents of
        his parents. This evidence again  accords  with  that  of  Landinfo
        (December 2017) who conclude that it can  be  difficult  to  obtain
        replacement ID documents from an embassy abroad for the  individual
        who is unable to verify his or her identity.

        27. If you are in Iraq, and have all of the required documents,  in
        normal circumstances the process is straightforward and  quick  and
        should take no more than three days. Dr Fatah's  own  daughter  was
        born in the United Kingdom and he managed to obtain her a  CSID  in
        one day from the office in Sulaymaniyah, upon payment  of  a  small
        fee. Dr Fatah was less  optimistic  about  the  efficiency  of  the
        process if in the United Kingdom. He has regular dealings with  the
        consulate in London and he is not impressed.  He  said  that  staff
        there are generally very unhelpful.

        ..."

  20. Having taken all of that evidence into account I  find  the  Appellant
      could provide a signed statement explaining why he  does  not  have  a
      CSID. I assume for these purposes that he is in  contact  with  family
      members in Iraq who would be  willing,  and  have  the  standing,   to
      countersign his application.   There would be  no  difficulty  in  him
      providing  the  10  colour  photographs  required.  After   that   his
      application becomes more problematic.  In his research prior to AAH Dr
      Fatah made contact with the consulate in London and having done so  he
      included in his list of necessary  documents  the  individual's  Iraqi
      passport and four colour photocopies of his INC.  As  I  have  already
      found, this Appellant has neither of these items.    These  evidential
      requirements must be viewed in the context of the very great number of
      Iraqi nationals who are undocumented, and  Dr  Fatah's  evidence  (see
      AAH) that the embassy in London is "generally very unhelpful" and that
      the problems of an individual returnee are regarded as  "trivial".   I
      accept that  it  is  reasonably  likely  that  the  embassy  would  be
      unwilling or unable  to  process  an  application  that  required  any
      particular effort, for instance if the applicant's identity could only
      be verified with reference to  records  in  Iraq.   Accordingly  I  am
      satisfied that there is a reasonable  likelihood  that  the  Appellant
      will not be able to get a CSID before he leaves  the  United  Kingdom.
      Although neither party has brought it to my attention, I note that  my
      findings are here consistent  with  the  conclusions  reached  by  the
      author  of  the  latest  CPIN  on  Iraq  Internal  relocation,   civil
      documentation and returns published in June  2020  which  at  [2.6.16]
      concludes "it is highly unlikely that an individual would be  able  to
      obtain a CSID from the Iraqi Embassy while in the UK".

  21. Another option would be for the Appellant  to  get  a  member  of  his
      family to help him, either by  bringing  to  him  at  the  airport  an
      existing identity card, or obtaining for him a new one. I do not think
      it necessary for me to make a finding on  whether  the  Appellant  has
      family members left in  Iraq  for  reasons  that  will  become  clear.
      Assuming for the purpose of my decision that he does, I  am  satisfied
      that they are today extremely likely to in possession of his CSID.  As
      the First-tier Tribunal acknowledged  in  its  decision,  the  Kurdish
      community in Tuz Khurmato has had a very  difficult  few  years.  Many
      thousands were subject to persecution or fled under ISIS,  and in  the
      months which followed many  more  were  subject  to  forced  eviction,
      looting and shelling by Shi'a militias  loyal  to  the  Government  of
      Iraq, with as much as  90%  of  the  population  at  one  point  being
      displaced. Kurdish homes were burned down and destroyed.  The  chances
      of family members taking the trouble to retain and protect the CSID of
      someone who has left the country - and therefore has no need for it  -
      would in those circumstances be remote.

  22. There remains the question whether any family members remaining in the
      area would  be  able  to  obtain  a  new  identity  document  for  the
      Appellant, and bring it to him at the airport. It is here that the new
      evidence about INIDs set out in SMO becomes relevant.   The  pertinent
      part of the headnote sets out the Tribunal's findings:

        "The CSID is being replaced with a  new  biometric  Iraqi  National
        Identity Card - the INID.  As a general matter, it is necessary for
        an individual to have one of these two documents in order  to  live
        and travel within Iraq without encountering treatment or conditions
        which are contrary to Article 3 ECHR.   Many of the checkpoints  in
        the country are manned by Shia militia who are  not  controlled  by
        the GOI and are unlikely to permit an individual without a CSID  or
        an INID to pass.  A valid  Iraqi  passport  is  not  recognised  as
        acceptable proof of identity for internal travel.

        ...

        Once in Iraq, it remains the case that an individual is expected to
        attend their local CSA office in  order  to  obtain  a  replacement
        document.  All CSA offices have now re-opened, although the  extent
        to which records have been destroyed by the conflict with  ISIL  is
        unclear, and is likely  to  vary  significantly  depending  on  the
        extent and intensity of the conflict in the area in question.

        An individual returnee who is not from Baghdad is not likely to  be
        able to obtain a replacement  document  there,  and  certainly  not
        within a reasonable time.  Neither  the  Central  Archive  nor  the
        assistance facilities for IDPs are likely to  render  documentation
        assistance to an undocumented returnee.

        The likelihood of obtaining a replacement identity document by  the
        use of a proxy, whether from the UK  or  on  return  to  Iraq,  has
        reduced due to the introduction of the INID system.   In  order  to
        obtain an INID, an individual must attend their local CSA office in
        person to enrol their biometrics, including fingerprints  and  iris
        scans.  The CSA offices in which INID terminals have been installed
        are unlikely - as a result of the phased replacement  of  the  CSID
        system - to issue a CSID, whether to an individual in person or  to
        a proxy.   The  reducing  number  of  CSA  offices  in  which  INID
        terminals have not been installed will continue to issue  CSIDs  to
        individuals and their proxies  upon  production  of  the  necessary
        information."

  23. The consequence of those findings for the Appellant is  this.  If  the
      civil registry in his home area is now issuing INIDs, his appeal  must
      be allowed, since he is caught in  an  administrative  Catch-22  which
      will leave him in Baghdad destitute and in conditions engaging Article
      15(b): unlike their predecessor  CSIDs,  INIDs  cannot  be  issued  to
      proxies, and so it would not be possible for anyone to  get  one,  and
      bring it to the Appellant. The final matter that I  must  consider  is
      therefore what the position is in the Appellant's  home  town  of  Tuz
      Khurmato.

  24. In SMO the Tribunal was not given specific evidence on  the  locations
      of these terminals. As the decision makes clear,  such  a  list  would
      have been quickly outdated as the programme is rolled out  across  the
      country. What the Tribunal was able to say is that  it  has  been  the
      towns and cities that have been provided  with  terminals  first:  the
      Respondent's position was that CSIDs were still being issued in "rural
      areas" [at �389].  Even in the absence of specific  confirmation  that
      Tuz is one such a city, I find it to be reasonably likely that  it  is
      so, for the following reasons.

  25. Tuz Khurmato falls at the southernmost tip of the  areas  of  northern
      Iraq populated by Kurds - its mixed population includes Sunni  Turkmen
      and Shia Arabs.  At one time it was part of the Kurdish  governate  of
      Kirkuk, until Saddam Hussain hived it off to become  part  of  largely
      Arab Salah al-Din.   As such it has been heavily contested for  years.
       It fell under ISIL control in 2014, was retaken by the Kurds in 2015,
      and in 2017 was the scene  of  widespread  killing  and  human  rights
      abuses as militias under the control of the Government of  Iraq  drove
      out the Peshmerga, and most of the Kurdish  population.   During  this
      period the area suffered "significant infrastructure damage" [see  SMO
      �262]; we  know  that  ISIL  routinely  destroyed  civil  registration
      offices [see AAH �104].   As such it appears likely that the  existing
      registration infrastructure would have been destroyed, or at the  very
      least seriously compromised. This being a city where the  priority  of
      the Government of Iraq is to consolidate central control from  Baghdad
      it is inconceivable to me that they would simply have replaced the old
      civil registry. It is far more likely that the new system  would  have
      been installed.

  26. My analysis  has  found  support  in  new  evidence  provided  by  the
      Appellant for the purposes of the remaking in the  Upper  Tribunal:  a
      screenshot from the website of the  Iraqi  Government  'National  Card
      Affairs Directorate', made on the 22nd June 2020, which contains  text
      in both English and Arabic. The English is not easy to follow  and  it
      is apparent, once one follows the live  link  (http://www.nid-moi-gov-
      iq/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=241),  that  the   exclusively
      Arabic text in the actual website has been translated for the  purpose
      of the screenshot by an automatic translation  function  online.   The
      meaning is nevertheless clear:

        "In the district of Tuz Khurmato, which  is  characterised  by  its
        many components and its peaceful coexistence,  the  Tuz  Conditions
        [this should read 'Tuz State Adminstrator'] continues to issue  the
        National  Card  to  citizens.  The  director  of  the   department,
        Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Qanbar confirmed that his department has
        issued more than 68,000 cards so far, while he indicated that there
        was heavy demand by the people  of  the  judiciary  [administrative
        area] to issue the national card...."

  27. I do not accept Ms Isherwood's submission for the Secretary  of  State
      that this is vague. The clear import of this article is  that,  as  my
      analysis above concludes, Tuz Khurmato is a city where the  government
      is now issuing the new national card.

  28. The consequence of that, for this Appellant, is that he has  no  means
      of travelling from Baghdad to his home city where he could  be  issued
      with new identity documents enabling him to  work,  live  and  receive
      basic services. It is the Respondent's stated  position  that  without
      such a card an Iraqi returnee  faces  a  real  risk  of  falling  into
      destitution such that his living conditions would violate  the  United
      Kingdom's obligations under Article 3  ECHR/  Article  15(b)  QD.  The
      appeal falls to be allowed on that basis.



Anonymity Order

  29. The Appellant is entitled  to  international  protection.  Having  had
      regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
      2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders
      I therefore consider it appropriate to make an order in the  following
      terms:

        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




      Decisions

  30. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains  material  error
      of law and it is set aside.

  31. The decision in the appeal is remade as follows: the appeal is allowed
      on protection and human rights grounds.

  32. There is an order for anonymity.

                                                  Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce
                                                             1st August 2020
                                                     -----------------------
[1] In my original directions I had invited submissions on whether it was
"reasonably likely that the Appellant will be able to get a CSID in
London";  I am grateful to Ms Clarke of Broudie, Jackson and Canter for
pointing out that the question was in fact whether he would be reasonably
unlikely to do so.  My directions were amended accordingly.
