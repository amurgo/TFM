Before



UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE PITT





Between



David Obi

(ANONYMITY DIRECTION not made)

and



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

Respondent

	

	

	DECISION AND REASONS

	

	This is an appeal against the decision dated 19 April 2018 of First-tier Tribunal Judge NMK Lawrence.

	Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted in a decision dated 13 July 2018. 

	In a Rule 24 response dated 28 August 2018 the respondent concedes a material error of law and agrees to the appeal being remitted to the First-Tier Tribunal to be re-made. 

	Following that indication, the Upper Tribunal finds that the decision of the First-Tier Tribunal discloses a material error on a point of law and sets it aside to be re-made de novo in the First-Tier Tribunal. 

	The hearing in the Upper Tribunal listed for Monday 3 September 2018 is vacated.



Notice of Decision



The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error on a point of law and is set aside to be remade de novo in the First-tier Tribunal.  





Signed:  							Date: 30 August 2018
