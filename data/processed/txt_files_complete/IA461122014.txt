For the Appellant:     Mr V Makol, Solicitor; Maalik & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, a citizen of India, born on 15  December  1991,  appeals
    against the decision of the Respondent  refusing  his  application  for
    further leave to remain based upon his family life under Article 8 ECHR
    in respect of his British partner, Ms Sarah Lindsay.






 2. The Appellant entered the UK as a Tier 4 student with valid leave  from
    11 May 2011 until 25 November 2014. The Appellant's leave  was  however
    curtailed under paragraph 323A(a)(iii)(2) of the Immigration  Rules  so
    as to expire on 24 November 2013 due to ceasing study with his sponsor.
    The Appellant did not make any application to extend his  leave  before
    its expiry in 2013 and subsequently became an overstayer. On 9 December
    2013, the Appellant was served with an IS151A notice.  However,  within
    28 days of overstaying, the Appellant submitted an  application  on  18
    December 2013 for leave to remain under the family and private life 10-
    year route. On 20 January 2014, the application was rejected and on  30
    January 2014 the Appellant resubmitted his application. The application
    was then refused on 11 February 2014.






 3. On 19 May 2014, the Appellant made a further application for  leave  to
    remain on the basis of  his  relationship  with  Ms  Sarah  Lindsay,  a
    British citizen. On 10 June  2014,  his  application  was  refused  and
    certified as clearly unfounded. On 16  September  2014,  the  Appellant
    informed the Respondent that Ms Lindsay was pregnant and on 24  October
    2014 further submissions were made on the  Appellant's  behalf.  On  28
    October 2014, a decision was made to refuse the application  for  leave
    to remain and removal directions  were  issued  against  the  Appellant
    pursuant to section 10 of the Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  1999.  The
    Appellant  appealed  pursuant  to  section  82  of   the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the  2002  Act")  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal which dismissed his appeal. That  determination  was  appealed
    and set aside by me for material error of law. Consequently the  appeal
    now arises before me without any findings of fact preserved.





The Hearing


 4. I heard evidence from the  Appellant  primarily  in  English  with  the
    assistance of a Punjabi interpreter for occasional phrases that he  was
    unable to communicate. I  also  heard  evidence  from  the  Appellant's
    partner, Ms Sarah Lindsay, and Ms  Emma  Lindsay  (Ms  Sarah  Lindsay's
    sister). A full note of their evidence is  set  out  in  my  record  of
    proceedings which I shall not rehearse herein.





Findings of Fact and Reasons


   5. The standard of proof is to the civil standard and that of the balance
      of probability. I have considered all the evidence in the appeal,
      including the appellant's and respondent's bundles and the authorities
      I have been referred to. I heard submissions from both parties which
      are set out in full in my record of proceedings.






   6. From the outset, I find that the Appellant, his partner Ms Sarah
      Lindsay, and her sister, Ms Emma Lindsay are all witnesses of truth
      and I found their evidence credible. The Respondent equally did not
      seek to persuade me otherwise and accepted that the witness evidence
      was credible. It is fair to say that the facts were not in dispute in
      this appeal so much as the interpretation of the Appellant's family
      life against the Rules and Article 8 of the European Convention on
      Human Rights. Consequently, I turn my attention to the Rules given
      that they are a starting point for my assessment concerning the
      Appellant's family life under Article 8. Those Rules take automatic
      account for the Secretary of State's view as to the public interest
      that must be weighed in the balance in the Respondent's codified
      approach to assessing any person's convention rights in respect of
      their family (or private) life under Article 8 ECHR.





Immigration Rules and Appendix FM


   7. To succeed under Appendix FM in relation to his family life with his
      partner, the Appellant must meet R-LTRP.1.1.(d) which states as
      follows:


          i) the applicant must not fall for refusal under Section S-LTR:
             Suitability leave to remain; and


         ii) the applicant meets the requirements of paragraphs E-LTRP.1.2-
             1.12. and E- LTRP.2.1.; and


        iii) paragraph EX.1. applies.






   8. My findings in respect of the immigration rules, particularly in
      relation to family life as a partner under Appendix FM, are as
      follows. In respect of the suitability requirements under S-LTR, the
      Refusal Letter remains silent, however for the avoidance of doubt I
      cannot see that the Appellant would fall for refusal under the
      suitability requirements given that there is nothing in his history
      that would call for his being deemed unsuitable under S-LTR as, for
      example, he has not made false representations or been the subject of
      a deportation order nor has it been said that his presence is not
      conducive to the public good.






   9. I find that the Appellant and Ms Lindsay are in a genuine and
      subsisting relationship. The relationship commenced in 2012 and they
      have been living together since October 2013 and the Appellant and Ms
      Lindsay plan to marry in the future. Therefore, the Appellant is the
      fianc� of Ms Lindsay and a partner under GEN.1.2 of Appendix FM (as
      already stated at paragraph 13 of the Refusal Letter of 28 October
      2014).






  10. In respect of the eligibility requirements, it is not in dispute that
      the Appellant and his partner meet the requirements at E-LTRP.1.2-
      .1.12 and 2.1 except for 1.12 which states that "The applicant's
      partner cannot be the applicant's fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner,
      unless the applicant was granted entry clearance as that person's
      fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner." It is clear from the Appellant's
      immigration history (supra) that he was not granted entry clearance as
      a fianc� and so the eligibility requirements cannot be met in this one
      regard. Consequently, the Appellant cannot succeed on the basis of his
      family with his partner under the Rules.






  11. Turning to his family life with his child, the Appellant must meet R-
      LTRPT.1.1 which states as follows:


         R-LTRPT.1.1. The requirements to be met for limited or indefinite
         leave to remain as a parent or partner are-


         (a)  the applicant and the child must be in the UK;


         (b)  the applicant must have made a valid application for limited
             or indefinite leave to remain as a parent or partner; and
             either


         (c)  (i) the applicant must not fall for refusal under Section S-
             LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and


              (ii) the applicant meets all of the requirements of Section
             ELTRPT: Eligibility for leave to remain as a parent, or


         (d)  (i) the applicant must not fall for refusal under S-LTR:
             Suitability leave to remain; and


             (ii) the applicant meets the requirements of paragraphs E-
             LTRPT.2.2-2.4. and E- LTRPT.3.1.; and


             (iii) paragraph EX.1. applies.






  12. My findings in respect of the immigration rules, particularly in
      relation to family life as a parent under Appendix FM, are as follows.
      In R-LTRPT.1.1(a) it is not in dispute that the Appellant and his
      child (hereinafter "Miss A") are both in the UK. There is no dispute
      that the application was valid (R-LTRPT.1.1.(b)) nor that the
      Appellant falls for refusal under the suitability requirements under S-
      LTR (see above) (R-LTRPT.1.1.(c)(i)). In respect of the eligibility
      requirements for leave to remain as a parent, they state in relevant
      part, as follows:


         E-LTRPT.2.2. The child of the applicant must be-


         (a) under the age of 18 years at the date of application, or where
         the child has turned 18 years of age since the applicant was first
         granted entry clearance or leave to remain as a parent under this
         Appendix, must not have formed an independent family unit or be
         leading an independent life;


         (b) living in the UK; and


         (c) a British Citizen or settled in the UK; or


         (d) has lived in the UK continuously for at least the 7 years
         immediately preceding the date of application and paragraph EX.1.
         applies.


         E-LTRPT.2.3. Either-


         (a) the applicant must have sole parental responsibility for the
         child or the child normally lives with the applicant and not their
         other parent (who is a British Citizen or settled in the UK); or


         (b) the parent or carer with whom the child normally lives must be-




             (i) a British Citizen in the UK or settled in the UK;


             (ii) not the partner of the applicant (which here includes a
             person who has been in a relationship with the applicant for
             less than two years prior to the date of application); and


             (iii) the applicant must not be eligible to apply for leave to
             remain as a partner under this Appendix.


         E-LTRPT.2.4.


         (a) The applicant must provide evidence that they have either-


             (i) sole parental responsibility for the child, or that the
             child normally lives with them; or


             (ii) access rights to the child; and


         (b) The applicant must provide evidence that they are taking, and
         intend to continue to take, an active role in the child's
         upbringing.


         E-LTRPT.3.1. The applicant must not be in the UK-


         (a) as a visitor; or


         (b) with valid leave granted for a period of 6 months or less,
         unless that leave was granted pending the outcome of family court
         or divorce proceedings.






  13. Miss A, the daughter of the Appellant and Ms Lindsay was born on [ ]
      2015 (she is now just over 1 year old) and was not born at the date of
      application, consequently, it is not clear that E-LTRPT.2.2.(a) is
      met, or whether I can take into account the child's presence at the
      date of hearing. If I am right in my assessment that the rules
      preclude consideration of children whom were born after an application
      were made, this would give rise to grave concerns in relation to the
      Respondent's duty towards children under section 55 of the Borders,
      Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 (hereinafter "the 2009 Act"). In
      any event, the Respondent did not discourage me from considering Miss
      A under the Rules and so I shall continue my assessment for the time
      being.






  14. It is clear from the evidence before me and I find that the child,
      Miss A, is living in the UK and is a British Citizen by virtue of her
      mother's citizenship since her birth in Sunderland. In respect of E-
      LTRPT.2.3.(a), it is clear from the evidence that the Appellant does
      not have sole responsibility for the child as he lives with his
      partner and the child, which also defeats his entitlement under E-
      LTRPT.2.3.(b) and E-LTRPT.2.4.(a) also. However, it is also obvious
      that the Appellant intends to continue to take an active role in his
      child's upbringing and that his partner wishes this too and meets E-
      LTRPT.2.4.(b). For the sake of completeness, I also find that the
      applicant meets E-LTRPT.3.1. as he is not in the UK as a visitor nor
      does he have any leave at present.






  15. Consequently, given that the Appellant cannot meet E-LTRPT.2.3. or  E-
      LTRPT.2.4.(a), he cannot succeed under the Immigration Rules on the
      basis of his family life with his child simply because he lives with
      the child and is the partner of Ms Lindsay.






  16. I am unable to gone on and consider EX.1. given that that paragraph is
      not freestanding as confirmed by the decision of the Upper Tribunal in
       Sabir (Appendix FM - EX.1 not free standing) (Pakistan) [2014] UKUT
      63 (IAC) which summarises the correct position in its headnote as
      follows:


         It is plain from the architecture of the Rules as regards partners
         that EX.1 is "parasitic" on the relevant Rule within Appendix FM
         that otherwise grants leave to remain. If EX.1 was intended to be a
         free- standing element some mechanism of identification would have
         been used. The structure of the Rules as presently drafted requires
         it to be a component part of the leave granting Rule. This is now
         made plain by the respondent's guidance dated October 2013.






  17. Thus, I am unable to accept the Appellant's submissions that the
      Appellant's appeal falls to succeed under the Rules.






  18. However, matters do not cease there and it is clear from the above
      assessment that the relationship with the partner, Ms Sarah Lindsay,
      has not fallen to succeed due to the Appellant being her fianc� but
      not having extant leave in that capacity; and the relationship with
      the child, Miss A, has not fallen to succeed because the Appellant
      paradoxically lives with his child as well as his partner.






  19. In my view, the family life of the Appellant with his partner falls
      for consideration outwith the Rules given that the fact of his lack of
      status has resulted in an assessment that has not accounted for their
      particular day-to-day circumstances nor the difficulty they may
      allegedly face on separation nor the allegation that the Appellant is
      unusually the primary carer for the child as opposed to the partner
      nor the fact that the removal of the Appellant may impact upon persons
      outside of his partner and child (discussed below). There is also
      cause for the family life with the child to be considered outwith the
      Rules given that the fact of the Appellant living with his child has
      under a Rules-based assessment rendered the removal of the Appellant
      as proportionate to the public interest whereas there has been no
      consideration of the child's best interests under the Rules, nor the
      effect on the child's day-to-day care should the Appellant be removed,
      let alone a primary consideration of such matters in potential
      contravention of section 55 of the 2009 Act. Consequently, there is
      ample reason to consider matters outwith the Rules under the umbrella
      of exceptionality or exceptional circumstances.





Article 8 ECHR


  20. I make my assessment of the Appellant's Article 8 family life by
      following the five questions set down by the House of Lords in R, (on
      the application of) Razgar v Secretary of State for the Home
      Department [2004] UKHL 27, with modification by this Tribunal in
      Omotunde (best interests - Zambrano applied - Razgar) Nigeria [2011]
      UKUT 247 (IAC). Those questions to be posed are summarised in the
      headnote for Omotunde which reads as follows:

         1. When applying the judgment of  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the
         European Union in Ruiz Zambrano (European citizenship) [2011] EUECJ
         Case C-34/09 OJ 2011 C130/2 and that of the  Supreme  Court  in ZH
         (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4; [2011] 2 WLR 148, in  relation  to  the
         proposed administrative removal or deportation of one  or  both  of
         his non-national parents, the welfare of a  child,  particularly  a
         child who is a British citizen, is a primary consideration.
         2. National courts must engage with the question whether removal of
         a particular parent  will  'deprive  [the  child]  of  the  genuine
         enjoyment of the substance of the rights attaching to the status of
         European Union citizen'.
         3. Where there are strong public interest reasons to expel a  non-
         national parent, any right of residence for the parent  is  not  an
         absolute one but is subject  to  the  Community  Law  principle  of
         proportionality. There is no  substantial  difference  between  the
         human  rights  based   assessment   of   proportionality   of   any
         interference considered by Lady  Hale  in ZH  (Tanzania) and  the
         approach required by Community law.
         4. In this particular context, the Article 8 assessment  questions
         set out in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 should be tailored as  follows,
         placing the assessment of necessity  where  it  most  appropriately
         belongs  in  the  final  question  dependent  on  the  outcome   of
         proportionality and a fair balance, rather  than  as  part  of  the
         identification of the legitimate aim:
           1.  Is there family life enjoyed between the  appellant  and  a
           minor child that requires respect in the context of  immigration
           decision making?
           2.  Would deportation of the parent interfere with the enjoyment
           of that family life?
           3.  Is such an interference in accordance with the law?
           4.  Is such an interference in pursuit of a legitimate aim?
           5.  Is deportation necessary, proportionate and a fair  balance
           between the rights  to  respect  for  the  family  life  of  the
           appellant and the child and the particular  public  interest  in
           question?





  21. In light of the above, I shall address those questions as they appear;
      before turning to my findings in relation to the Appellant's family
      life with his partner so far as relevant.






    Is there family life?


  22. Although trite and not in dispute between the parties, I find that
      family life exists between the Appellant and his child. As stated on
      Miss A's birth certificate, she was born on 1 May 2015 in Sunderland
      to the Appellant and his partner, Ms Lindsay, and Miss A has lived
      under the care of her parents since birth. Based upon the Appellant's
      and his partner's evidence, which I have already indicated to be
      credible, I further find that the Appellant is the primary carer for
      Miss A. That is because he is the parent with primary responsibility
      for the child and stays at home and looks after the child for the
      majority of the day as the partner is the only person working and is
      the breadwinner of the family for all intents and purposes. I accept
      that given her work Ms Lindsay does not have time to look after her
      daughter and whilst the sister, Ms Emma Lindsay, is able to babysit
      once in a while to give the couple occasional respite, there is no
      other viable source of support and ultimately, even if there were, the
      Appellant is the primary carer of his British daughter. Thus, family
      life is enjoyed between the Appellant and his minor child that
      requires respect in the context of immigration decision making and
      both the Appellant's and his child's Convention rights are engaged.






    Would removal interfere with the enjoyment of family life?


  23. Again, this question is clearly answered in the affirmative given that
      removal of the appellant would disrupt the status quo that exists in
      the family life presently enjoyed by the Appellant with his partner
      and child. The proposed interference clearly passes the minimum level
      or threshold for engagement of the Article 8(1) convention right,
      which has been described as "not a specially high one" (see AG
      (Eritrea) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] EWCA Civ
      801 at [26-28]) and was further described as being more than a
      "technical or inconsequential interference with one of the protected
      rights" (see  VW (Uganda) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
      [2009] EWCA Civ 5 at [22]).






    Is such interference in accordance with the law and in pursuit of a
    legitimate aim?


  24. I take the next two questions together as here there is no contention
      that the decision is not in accordance with the law but that the
      outcome is disproportionate. The right to respect for family life is
      protected by article 8, however this is a qualified right which may be
      interfered with if this is necessary in order to pursue a legitimate
      aim. That aim in the context of immigration takes the form of the
      maintenance of firm and fair immigration control.






    Is removal necessary, proportionate and a fair balance between the
    rights to respect for the family life of the appellant and the child
    and the particular public interest in question?


  25. Turning to the nub of the family life assessment, I turn my attention
      first to the best interests of the child given that they are a primary
      consideration and are an integral part of the proportionality
      assessment under Article 8 ECHR (see ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary of
      State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 4 and Zoumbas v Secretary of
      State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC 74). I bear in mind that the
      best interests of a child can be outweighed by the cumulative effect
      of other considerations, but no other consideration can be treated as
      inherently more significant.






  26. I therefore make the following findings regarding the child's
      circumstances and what is in the child's best interests before turning
      to whether those interests are outweighed by the force of other
      considerations; bearing in mind that a child must not of course be
      blamed for matters for which he or she is not responsible, such as the
      conduct of a parent.






  27. I find that it is plainly in the child, Miss A's, best interests to
      remain in the UK her country of birth and citizenship, and that it is
      also in her best interests to be raised by both parents, as opposed to
      one.






  28. Miss A, is a British citizen. She is not subject to immigration
      control and cannot be removed as she possess an inalienable right of
      abode (see sections 1(1) and 2(1)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971). The
      same applies equally to the partner. It has been stated historically
      that it is not reasonable for a British child and parent to relocate
      outside of the EU. That ratio is derived from the Grand Chamber's
      decision in Ruiz Zambrano v Office national de l'emploi [2011] EUECJ
      Case C-34/09, where it was stated as follows at [42]:


         "...Article 20 TFEU precludes national measures which have the
         effect of depriving citizens of the Union of the genuine enjoyment
         of the substance of the rights conferred by virtue of their status
         as citizens of the Union..."






  29. This ratio was reinforced by the decision of this Tribunal in Sanade
      and others (British children - Zambrano - Dereci) India [2012] UKUT 48
      (IAC), wherein the following was summarised at headnotes 5 and 6:


      5. Case C-34/09 Ruiz Zambrano now makes it clear that where the child
         or indeed the remaining spouse is a British citizen and therefore a
         citizen of the European Union, as a matter of EU law it is not
         possible to require the family as a unit to relocate outside of the
         European Union or for the Secretary of State to submit that it
         would be reasonable for them to do so.






      6. Where in the context of Article 8 one parent ("the remaining
         parent") of a British citizen child is also a British citizen (or
         cannot be removed as a family member or in their own right), the
         removal of the other parent does not mean that either the child or
         the remaining parent will be required to leave, thereby infringing
         the Zambrano principle, see C-256/11 Murat Dereci. The critical
         question is whether the child is dependent on the parent being
         removed for the exercise of his Union right of residence and
         whether removal of that parent will deprive the child of the
         effective exercise of residence in the United Kingdom or elsewhere
         in the Union.






  30. In light of the above decisions, I find that the Zambrano principle is
      engaged given that the remaining partner and child are both British
      citizens; and given that the child is dependent on the parent being
      removed and removal of that parent will deprive the child of the
      effective exercise of residence in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in
      the Union. I make this finding given that the Appellant is the primary
      carer for the child as discussed above (at [22]). Were the Appellant
      to be removed, in my view, the child would be deprived of the rights
      and enjoyment of her citizenship of the EU given that her father is
      her primary carer and given that her mother works as the breadwinner.
      It is plain that the child cannot live without her father given the
      role he fulfils. I am also concerned as to the impact that the
      Appellant's removal would have upon the partner and her ability to
      work and support the family. She does not have any support beyond the
      occasional babysitting provided by her sister. I heard evidence that
      the partner's parents live nearby but the partner's mother is
      suffering from terminal cancer and is plainly unable to assist in
      caring for the child, and she is cared for herself full-time by the
      partner's father whom took early retirement to become a carer for the
      mother. In those circumstances, I am fortified in my finding that
      there is no further support available to the couple and the removal of
      the Appellant would result in a contravention of the Zambrano
      principle governing his daughter's EU citizenship. In summary, the
      scenario is, I find, a fragile and bleak one of a young couple
      struggling to raise their child with no further assistance of note.






  31. I further find that the partner and child would not relocate to India
      at all as a matter of choice, given the partner's plain and frank
      evidence that she would not go to India and neither would her
      daughter. The motivation for this included her wish to be by her
      mother's bedside outside of her employment given that the mother's
      cancer had spread to her liver, bones and other organs.






  32. There is a further complication to the status quo of the family matrix
      as the partner revealed in her evidence that she also provides
      financial support for her mother. Given that further commitment, I
      find that the partner's presence in the UK is essential not only to
      support her own young family, but also to assist in supporting her
      mother, particularly given that the father has had to take early
      retirement. Consequently, it would seem that the Appellant's proposed
      removal would impact directly and indirectly upon his child, his
      partner and his partner's parents also.






  33. At any rate, even if I am wrong in my findings concerning the
      application of the Zambrano principle, I shall move on to consider the
      public interest and legitimate aim balanced against the child's best
      interests, without reference to the Zambrano ratio and perform that
      balancing assessment in its pure statutory and curial form.






Proportionality assessment and Section 117B of the 2002 Act


  34. Turning the approach to the assessment of proportionality following
      the inception of section 117 of the 2002 Act, the public interest now
      takes a statutory form that courts and tribunals are bound to "have
      regard" to (see Dube (ss.117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 90 (IAC)). The
      appearance of the section 117 considerations is intrinsic to the
      question of proportionality (as both the judgments in Razgar and the
      reformulation of the key questions in Omotunde demonstrate). Having
      considered the child's best interests and concluded that they are that
      she remain with her parents, it is in my proportionality assessment,
      balancing that child's best interests against countervailing factors,
      that I now turn to consider the public interest (in harmony with the
      decision in Forman (ss 117A-C considerations) [2015] UKUT 412 (IAC)).






  35. As stated in section 117A(2) of the 2002 Act, in considering the
      public interest question, the court or tribunal must (in particular)
      have regard  in all cases, to the considerations listed in section
      117B and the public interest question is defined as follows: ""the
      public interest question" means the question of whether an
      interference with a person's right to respect for private and family
      life is justified under Article 8(2)."






  36. The enumerated considerations that I must consider under section 117B
      are as follows:


         117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable  in  all
         cases


         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in  the
         public interest.


         (2) It is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-


           (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and


           (b) are better able to integrate into society.


         (3) It is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
         financially independent, because such persons-


           (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and


           (b) are better able to integrate into society.


         (4) Little weight should be given to-


           (a) a private life, or


           (b) a relationship formed with a  qualifying  partner,  that  is
           established by a person at a time when  the  person  is  in  the
           United Kingdom unlawfully.


         (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established  by
         a person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
         precarious.


         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-


           (a)  the  person  has  a   genuine   and   subsisting   parental
           relationship with a qualifying child, and


           (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave  the
           United Kingdom.






  37. Taking those considerations in turn and paying them due regard, I find
      that the maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
      public interest and is firmly engaged in the current scenario. The
      Appellant has been an overstayer since 24 November 2013 and the
      interference with his family life with his child and partner, is in
      accordance with the law and in pursuit of a legitimate aim.






  38. I find that the Appellant is able to speak English sufficiently that
      he can manage in day-to-day life. That much is obvious from his spoken
      English before me and by virtue of his relationship with his partner,
      whom only speaks English and does not know any Punjabi. The Appellant
      gains "no positive right" by virtue of this skill and only gains "mild
      support" (see AM (S.117B) [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC) at [17-18] and R, (on
      the application of) Luma Sh Khairdin v Secretary of State for the Home
      Department (NIA 2002: Part 5A) IJR [2014] UKUT 566 (IAC) at [59]).






  39. Turning to the issue of financial independence, I find that the
      Appellant is financially independent due to his partner's income of
      �6.70 per hour, working at a Fish and Chip shop, although her salary
      is set to increase to �6048 per annum as a carer in a role that she
      has recently attained, although the partner made clear that she did
      not foresee that she could "ever" make enough money to meet the income
      threshold under the Rules of �18,600 and described that level of
      earnings for someone of her age living in Sunderland as completely
      "unrealistic". The Appellant is entitled to gain "mild support" for
      meeting this subsection this cannot attract any "positive right".






  40. Whilst the Appellant may be entitled to gain mild support, for
      whatever little that may be worth, I consider such support to be
      nominal or insignificant. At any rate, regardless of any support that
      may be derived from meeting 117B(2) and (3), pursuant to a decision of
      the Tribunal last year, what follows is that the public interest is
      not "fortified" given that sections 117B(2) and (3) fall in favour of
      the Appellant (see Forman (ss 117A-C considerations) [2015] UKUT 412
      (IAC) at [15]).






  41. In relation to the statutory instruction that little weight be given
      to a private life that is established by a person at a time when the
      person is in the United Kingdom unlawfully; the Appellant's private
      life formed whilst he held leave until 24 November 2013 may carry
      weight but thereafter it will only carry little weight.






  42. Regarding any relationship formed with a qualifying partner that is
      established by a person at a time when the person is in the United
      Kingdom unlawfully, the relationship was formed with Ms Lindsay in
      2012 and she is a qualifying partner (given that she is a British
      citizen and meets the definition of a "qualifying partner" at section
      117D(1)). The Appellant's leave was curtailed on 24 November 2013
      after the relationship began and so the instruction to accord the
      relationship little weight does not apply. However, to the given that
      family life was precarious from the outset, I do accord it little
      weight pursuant to R, (on the application of) Nagre v Secretary of
      State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) (see Rajendran
      (s117B - family life) [2016] UKUT 138 (IAC) at [39-42]).






  43. Turning to section 117B(5), little weight should be given to a private
      life established by a person at a time when the person's immigration
      status is precarious. The Appellant's status has been precarious
      throughout given that he only held temporary leave and became an
      overstayer on 24 November 2013. Consequently, although I have already
      accorded little weight to the private life of the Appellant, I repeat
      and reinforce that statutory instruction herein.






  44. Finally, turning to section 117B(6), I find that this subsection falls
      in the Appellant's and his child's favour. Before turning to my
      reasons, I set down briefly the approach I have taken to my assessment
      of section 117B(6) which is in line with the recent decision of
      Treebhawon and others (section 117B(6)) [2015] UKUT 674 (IAC) which
      states as follows in its first headnote:


          Section 117B (6) is a reflection of the distinction which
         Parliament has chosen to make between persons who are, and who are
         not, liable to deportation. In any case where the conditions
         enshrined in section 117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and
         Asylum Act 2002 are satisfied, the section 117B(6) public interest
         prevails over the public interests identified in section 117B (1)-
         (3).






  45. This ratio is further supported by [18, 20-22] of Treebhawon:


         "18. ...section 117B(6) is formulated in unqualified terms: in
         cases where its conditions are satisfied, the public interest
         does not require the removal from the United Kingdom of the person
         concerned. In this respect also it different from its siblings,
         which contain no comparable instruction."


         "20. In section 117B(6), Parliament has prescribed three
             conditions, namely:


              (a) the person concerned is not liable to deportation;


              (b)           such person has a genuine and subsisting
             parental relationship with a qualifying child, namely a person
             who is under the age of 18 and is a British citizen or has
             lived in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of seven
             years or more; and


              (c)            it would not be reasonable to expect the
             qualifying child to leave the United Kingdom.


          Within this discrete regime, the statute proclaims unequivocally
         that where these three conditions are satisfied the public interest
         does not require the removal of the parent from the United Kingdom.
         Ambiguity there is none.






         21.    Giving effect to the analysis above, in our judgment the
         underlying Parliamentary intention is that where the three
         aforementioned conditions are satisfied the public interests
         identified in section 117B(1) - (3) do not apply.






         22.    It would further appear that the " little weight" provisions
         of section 117B(4) - (5) are of no application. If Parliament had
         been desirous of qualifying, or diluting, section 117B(6) by
         reference to either section 117B(4) or (5), it could have done so
         with ease. It has not done so. Fundamentally, there is no
         indication in the structure or language of Part 5A that in cases
         where, on the facts, section 117B(4) and/or (5) is engaged, the
         unambiguous proclamation in Section 117B(6) is in some way weakened
         or demoted..."






  46. In light of the above, I approach section 117B(6), limb by limb. My
      reasons for finding this section applies are as follows. The Appellant
      is not liable to deportation. There is no dispute between the parties
      that the Appellant has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
      with a qualifying child, namely his British daughter. Finally, it
      would not be reasonable to expect Miss A to leave the UK. I make that
      finding for a host of reasons.


  47. First, the Respondent has issued guidance entitled Appendix FM 1.0
      Family Life (as a Partner or Parent) and Private Life: 10-Year Routes
      which states inter alia as follows at 11.2.3:


         11.2.3. Would it be unreasonable to expect a British Citizen child
         to leave the UK?


         Save in cases involving criminality, the decision maker must not
         take a decision in relation to the parent or primary carer of a
         British Citizen child where the effect of that decision would be to
         force that British child to leave the EU, regardless of the age of
         that child. This reflects the European Court of Justice judgment in
         Zambrano. The decision maker must consult the following guidance
         when assessing cases involving criminality...


         Where a decision to refuse the application would require a parent
         or primary carer to return to a country outside the EU, the case
         must always be assessed on the basis that it would be unreasonable
         to expect a British Citizen child to leave the EU with that parent
         or primary carer.


         In such cases it will usually be appropriate to grant leave to the
         parent or primary carer, to enable them to remain in the UK with
         the child, provided that there is satisfactory evidence of a
         genuine and subsisting parental relationship.


         It may, however, be appropriate to refuse to grant leave where the
         conduct of the parent or primary carer gives rise to considerations
         of such weight as to justify separation, if the child could
         otherwise stay with another parent or alternative primary carer in
         the UK or in the EU.


         The circumstances envisaged could cover amongst others:


         ( criminality falling below the thresholds set out in paragraph 398
         of the Immigration Rules;


         ( a very poor immigration history, such as where the person has
         repeatedly and deliberately breached the Immigration Rules.


         In considering whether refusal may be appropriate the decision
         maker must consider the impact on the child of any separation. If
         the decision maker is minded to refuse, in circumstances where
         separation would be the result, this decision should normally be
         discussed with a senior caseworker and, where appropriate, advice
         may be sought from the Office of the Children's Champion on the
         implications for the welfare of the child, in order to inform the
         decision.






  48. Whilst this guidance relates to the assessment that is performed under
      the Rules, the child did not benefit from that assessment and given
      the Respondent's statutory duty to safeguard the child's welfare, I
      consider it imperative that this guidance be considered outside the
      Rules by analogy with section 117B(6), which both appear to share a
      common message, namely that "(w)here a decision to refuse the
      application would require a parent or primary carer to return to a
      country outside the EU, the case must always be assessed on the basis
      that it would be unreasonable to expect a British Citizen child to
      leave the EU with that parent or primary carer". Here, the Appellant
      is the primary carer for the British child, and consequently the case
      must be assessed on the basis that it is unreasonable to expect the
      British Citizen child to leave the EU. Furthermore, there is no
      evidence of criminality and in my view, it cannot be said that the
      Appellant's immigration history is very poor in respect of repeated
      deliberate breaches of the Rules. Even if the guidance were not
      applicable, its message is in harmony with the Respondent's concession
      at [68] of MA and SM (Zambrano : EU children outside EU) Iran [2013]
      UKUT 380 whereby she maintained her stance in Sanade for all intents
      and purposes and thus the ratio would still apply in the absence of
      the guidance. Anyhow, given this indication of the Respondent's view
      in her guidance as to what it is reasonable to expect a British child
      to do, I find that it is unreasonable for the child to leave the UK
      with his primary carer on this first basis.






  49. Second, as I have observed above, the child is a British citizen and
      cannot be forced to leave the UK and I find that it is unreasonable
      for the child to leave the UK for this further reason.






  50. Third, the child's mother and father have both indicated that they do
      not wish her to return to India. Given that they are her parents and
      charged with her care, the fact of her relocation, at least, is
      unquestionable. I find that the child's departure is unreasonable for
      this further reason.






  51. Fourth, I find that there is no family support network or
      accommodation available for the child in India as stated by the
      Appellant in his evidence and I find that it is unreasonable for the
      child to leave the UK for this reason also.






  52. Fifth, if the child were to leave the UK it would compel the partner
      to quit her work and travel with her baby, whom at the end of the day
      is very young and cannot be apart from her mother for weeks or months
      at such a tender age. The departure of the child is unreasonable for
      this further reason again.






  53. Finally, the Respondent did not suggest for a moment in her closing
      submissions that it would be reasonable for the child to leave the UK
      and in fact stated openly that the partner cannot go back due to the
      mother's illness and acknowledged the child's citizenship status and
      acknowledged also that both the partner and child needed to be in the
      UK. As a result, I am fortified in my view that it is unreasonable for
      the child to leave the UK.






  54. Thus, I find that the three conditions in section 117B(6) are met and
      the public interest does not require the removal of the Appellant-
      parent from the United Kingdom. As stated above, the "little weight"
      provisions of section 117B(4)-(5) are of no application when
      considering section 117B(6). In conclusion, when balancing the best
      interests of the child against the legitimate aim and the public
      interest, I find that removal is disproportionate particularly as
      there is no public interest in the Appellant's removal as specified in
      statute by which I am bound.






  55. Given my findings above, I shall not go on to consider the Appellant's
      family life with his partner, nor the impact that his removal may have
      upon the partner's family, such as her parents.






    Decision


56. The appeal is refused under the Immigration Rules.






57. I allow the appeal on the basis of the Appellant's  family  life  under
    Article 8 ECHR.





    Anonymity


58. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity order and I  was  not
    asked to make one and do not see reason to do so.






    Fee Award


59. I do not make a fee award as my decision is based  upon  the  facts  at
    present which were different to those known by the Respondent when  she
    made her decision.
