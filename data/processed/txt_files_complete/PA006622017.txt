For the Appellant:     Mr J Martin of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

1.   The appellant was born on [ ] 1980 and is a citizen of Sri  Lanka.   On
    16th January 2017, the respondent refused to grant him  asylum  or,  in
    the alternative, humanitarian protection under paragraphs 336 and  339F
    of Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules HC 395  as  amended  ("the
    Immigration Rules").

2.   The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 20th April,  2010,  as  the
    dependant of a Tier 4 Student Migrant, his wife.  His leave was due  to
    expire on 1st August 2011.  On 30th July 2011 an application  was  made
    for leave for him to remain in the United Kingdom on the basis  of  his
    Article 8 rights.  This application was refused by  the  respondent  on
    20th September 2011.  The appellant appealed that decision to the First-
    tier Tribunal and his appeal was allowed.  The  appellant  was  granted
    discretionary leave until 22nd March, 2014.

3.   On 20th March 2014, the appellant applied for leave  as  the  dependant
    of a Tier 4 Migrant Student and this leave was due to  expire  on  30th
    April 2016.  Leave was  granted,  but  unfortunately  was  subsequently
    curtailed to expire on 5th  February  2015.   On  29th  July  2016  the
    appellant claimed asylum.  The  appellant  appealed  the  Secretary  of
    State's refusal to the First-tier Tribunal and his appeal was heard  by
    Judge O'Garro  at  Hatton  Cross  on  16th  May  2017.   Judge  O'Garro
    dismissed the appellant's  appeal  on  asylum  grounds,  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal on humanitarian protection grounds and dismissed his
    appeal on human rights grounds.

4.   The appellant sought and obtained permission to appeal  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal and in doing so asserted that the  judge  had  materially
    erred in law by failing to consider up-to-date background evidence.  It
    was  asserted  that  the  judge  had  erred  at  paragraph  36  of  her
    determination where she noted that the appellant's arrest  warrant  was
    issued in 2010 and that the appellant would have been aware  of  it  at
    the time based on evidence she quoted from procedures which took  place
    in Sri Lanka in 2001 and 2002.  The evidence which applied in 2010  was
    set out in the Country of Origin Report for 2012 and  which  the  judge
    failed to consider.

5.   Mr Tarlow accepted that the determination was flawed and could  not  be
    sustained.  I agree with him and was grateful to Mr Tarlow.

6.   The judge did not accept that the arrest warrant was  genuine  and  for
    this reason found that the appellant had not established that there was
    a real risk or that it was reasonably likely that  the  authorities  in
    Sri Lanka would regard him as a threat to the integrity  of  Sri  Lanka
    and take an interest in him.  The judge claimed that an employee of his
    was abducted and that the appellant was also abducted.

7.   I set aside the judge's determination.  Given the lengthy delays  which
    would inevitably occur, were I  to  adjourn  this  appeal  for  hearing
    afresh in the Upper Tribunal before  me,  I  have  concluded  that  the
    interests of justice requires that  I  remit  the  appeal  for  hearing
    afresh by a judge other than Judge O'Garro in the First-tier  Tribunal.
    A Sinhalese interpreter will  be  required  and  two  hours  should  be
    allowed for the hearing of the appeal.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

Richard Chalkley
A Judge of the Upper Tribunal                               Date  4  January
2018
