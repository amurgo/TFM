                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a national of Nepal.  He appealed to a Judge of the
First-tier Tribunal against the Secretary of State's decision of 11 July
2018 refusing his application for entry clearance to the United Kingdom.

2.   The judge dismissed the appeal and the appellant sought and was
granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

3.   The Secretary of State has accepted that the judge's decision should
be set aside and the appeal be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a
fresh hearing, bearing in mind the grounds of challenge, which are that the
judge erred in taking an incorrect approach to the Devaseelan guidance,
particularly so in light of the significant amount of new evidence provided
since the previous Tribunal decision. I agree.

4.   Accordingly, this appeal is allowed to the extent that it is remitted
for rehearing in the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor House before a judge
other than Judge Traynor.



Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed to the extent set out above.

No anonymity direction is made.
