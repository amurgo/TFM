                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The Appellant, a citizen of Algeria born on 27 January 1972,  appeals
    against the determination of an Adjudicator (Mr Peter Clarke) who, in a
    determination promulgated on 30  January  2003  would  appear  to  have
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal  on  both  asylum  grounds  and  human
    rights grounds, against the decision of the Secretary of  State,  dated
    24 September 2002, to issue removal directions to  an  illegal  entrant
    and giving removal directions  to  Algeria  following  refusal  of  his
    application for asylum.

2.    The Appellant was represented by Mr R Bhardwhaj, Solicitor, of  Rais,
    Solicitors, Birmingham, while Mr J Jones, Senior Home Office Presenting
    Officer, represented the Secretary of State.

3.    The grounds of appeal in this matter read as follows:-

         "1.      Even though  he  has  rejected  the  asylum  appeal,  the
              Adjudicator has failed to consider that  the  timing  of  any
              return should be related to current conditions in Algeria  to
              ensure that the Appellant will not be at risk.


           2.    Also the Adjudicator's Determination  is  very  vague  and
              contradictory  -  it  is  not  clear  at  all   whether   the
              Adjudicator has allowed or dismissed the appeal.


          3.     For example, at paragraph 32, the Adjudicator  has  stated
              that "I therefore find that the Appellant has discharged  the
              burden of proof of having a well founded fear or  persecution
              for a Convention reason.  I therefore come to the  conclusion
              that the Appellant's removal would cause the  United  Kingdom
              to  be  in  breach  of  its  obligations   under   the   1951
              Convention."  However, at paragraph 39, he  has  contradicted
              himself by stating that  "I  dismiss  the  appeal  on  asylum
              grounds."


          4.     The Adjudicator has repeated  the  same  contradiction  at
              paragraph 38 and 40 again.


          5.     THEREFORE WE SUBMIT, IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE THAT THIS
              APPEAL SHOULD BE REMITTED FOR A FRESH HEARING BEFORE  ANOTHER
              Adjudicator.


          6.     Further, we confirm that the Appellant  duly  attended  at
              our offices on 7th  February  2003  with  an  interpreter  to
              discuss his grounds of appeal.   Due  to  our  administrative
              error there has been a delay in lodging the  application  for
              leave to appeal to the IAT.  Kindly consider this application
              albeit out of time as the Appellant's  case  will  be  unduly
              prejudiced by this error on our part."


4.    Leave to appeal to the Tribunal was granted by  the  Tribunal  (Mr  K
    Drabu, Vice President) on 21 March 2003.

5.    In granting leave to appeal, the Tribunal stated as follows:-

      "Although the determination is generally sound, it does  suffer  from
         careless proofreading.  The errors are such  that  leave  must  be
         granted."

6.    When the appeal opened, by video link with Birmingham, on  14  August
    2003, the Tribunal sought the views of the representatives  as  to  the
    apparent discrepancies in  the  findings  of  the  Adjudicator  in  his
    determination.  The Tribunal drew attention  to  paragraph  32  of  the
    determination which reads as follows:-

      "Given these conclusions, I therefore find  that  the  Appellant  has
         discharged the burden of proof of having a  well-founded  fear  of
         persecution for a Convention reason.   I  therefore  come  to  the
         conclusion that the Appellant's removal  would  cause  the  United
         Kingdom to  be  in  breach  of  its  obligations  under  the  1951
         Convention."


7.    The Tribunal  then  drew  the  attention  of  the  representative  to
    paragraph 39 which reads as follows:-

      "I dismiss the appeal on asylum grounds."


8.    The Tribunal then  drew  the  attention  of  the  representatives  to
    paragraph 38 of the determination which states as follows:-

      "In the light of the above conclusions,  I  find  that  the  Decision
         appealed against would cause the United Kingdom to be  in   breach
         of the law or its obligations under Articles 2 or 3, of  the  1950
         Convention."


9.    The Tribunal  then  drew  the  attention  of  the  representative  to
    paragraph 40 which reads as follows:-

      "I dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds.


10.   The Tribunal also  drew  the  attention  of  the  representatives  to
    paragraph 59(1) of the Immigration and Asylum Appeals (Procedure) Rules
    2003 which read as follows:-

      "An Adjudicator or the Tribunal may at any time amend an order  or  a
         determination to correct a clerical error or other accidental slip
         or omission."


11.   The Tribunal also drew attention to paragraph 59(2)  which  reads  as
    follows:-

      "The power in paragraph (1) included the power  of  the  Tribunal  to
         amend an  order  or  a  determination  of  an  Adjudicator,  after
         consulting the Adjudicator concerned."


12.   Mr Jones submitted that there had been  correspondence  on  13  March
    2003, concerning these two apparent discrepancies as well as  the  fact
    that five paragraphs of the determination appear to have  been  omitted
    at some stage as there  are  no  paragraphs  28,  29,  30,  31  of  the
    determination and that despite representations having been made  as  to
    these matters,  and  the  suggestion  put  forward  that  it  could  be
    corrected under the old Rules, which then applied, nothing  appears  to
    have happened.  Mr Jones submitted that the  course  suggested  by  the
    Tribunal, namely to remit the matter to the same Adjudicator under Rule
    59(2) of the new Rules, would be the best course in the circumstances.

11.   Mr Bhardwhaj, while he realised the situation, and saw sense  in  the
    proposal, nevertheless submitted that the better course may be for  the
    whole matter to be remitted to another Adjudicator so that  the  matter
    could be considered afresh, as at this stage, some seven  months  after
    the Adjudicator had reached  his  decision,  it  may  put  him  into  a
    difficult position in coming  to  a  conclusion  as  to  which  of  the
    decisions was the correct one.  He submitted,  that  by  remitting  the
    matter to be heard afresh by  another  Adjudicator,  the  whole  matter
    could be solved.

12.   Mr Jones, in reply, submitted that that would not be necessary as  it
    would appear that it was merely an accidental slip and did  not  go  to
    the root of the Adjudicator's findings.

13.   The Tribunal, itself, having considered the point raised, was of  the
    view that what was before it now was all in the nature of an accidental
    slip or error rather than an  error  of  substance  and  that,  in  the
    circumstances, the better  course  would  be  for  this  appeal  to  be
    remitted  to  the  same  Adjudicator,  so  that  he  can  be  given  an
    opportunity to amend paragraph  32,  paragraph  38,  paragraph  39  and
    paragraph 40 as well as supplying the missing paragraphs 28, 29, 30 and
    31, if such paragraphs exist.

14.   Accordingly, the Tribunal, in the presence of the representatives, by
    video  link  with  Birmingham,  remitted  this  appeal  to   the   same
    Adjudicator  (Mr  Peter  Clarke)  under  Rule  59(1)  and  (2)  of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Appeals (Procedure) Rules 2003, so that  he  can
    make any necessary corrections and re-promulgate his  determination  in
    proper form, under the Rules, so that the Appellant can be given  every
    opportunity of lodging any necessary appeal, following Rule 59(3)(b) of
    the Immigration and Asylum Appeals (Procedure) Rules 2003.

15.   This appeal is, accordingly, remitted to  the  same  Adjudicator  (Mr
    Peter Clarke) under the terms of Rules 59 of the Procedure Rules 2003.
