                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: Mr H Shoeb, instructed by Howe & Co
For the appellant:     Ms K Pal, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Krishna Gurung, date of birth 9.3.87,  is  a  citizen  of
    Nepal.

 2. This is his appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Canavan, who allowed the claimant's appeal
    against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State,  dated  21.2.13,  to
    refuse his application made on 23.11.12  for  entry  clearance  to  the
    United Kingdom as the adult dependent son of Surjabahader Gurung, an ex-
    Gurkha, pursuant to paragraph 317 of the  Immigration  Rules  and  Home
    Office policy.

 3. The Judge heard the appeal on 11.2.14.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Cruthers  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    24.3.14.

 5. Thus the matter came before me on 13.5.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 6. There was some confusion, which the parties were not able to resolve at
    the hearing on 13.5.14 and I therefore adjourned the appeal to  a  date
    to be fixed as soon as possible, for the  respondent  to  consider  its
    position.

 7. The papers in the file before  me  contain  two  different  Notices  of
    Immigration Decision issued by the Entry Clearance Officer. The  first,
    dated 20.2.13, deals  with  the  claimant's  application  as  an  adult
    dependent relative under EC-DR 1.1 of Appendix FM and the  Home  Office
    Policy in chapter 15 section 2A 13.2, and  following  an  interview  on
    11.1.13.

 8. The second decision is dated the following day, 21.2.13,  and  purports
    to deal with the same application from the same applicant with the same
    reference  number  and  post.  This  one  purports  to  deal  with  the
    application under paragraph 317 of the Immigration Rules,  as  well  as
    the same Home Office Policy.

 9. The first 4 paragraphs of both documents  are  identical.  Ms  Ong  was
    unaware of the notice dated 20.2.13, but when she dug through the  file
    she found a copy of the  21.2.13  notice.  She  had  prepared  for  the
    hearing  on  the  assumption  that  the  decision  being  appealed  had
    addressed Appendix FM.

10. For his part, Mr Shoeb had the notice of 20.2.13  but  was  unaware  of
    21.2.13. Despite a short adjournment to try and unravel the  confusion,
    it was not possible to determine which decision was valid.

11. My concern was  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    obviously based  on  the  earlier  notice  of  decision,  dealing  with
    Appendix FM, but the notice of decision of 21.2.13 may have  superseded
    that of the previous  day,  rendering  the  notice  of  decision  dated
    20.2.13 no longer valid. This was highly relevant to the appeal  before
    me, as if the First-tier Tribunal appeal had proceeded on the basis  of
    the wrong decision, it would need to be set  aside.  If  the  'correct'
    decision incorrectly made the decision on the basis of  paragraph  317,
    which does not seem to apply in relation to an application made by this
    claimant after the introduction of Appendix FM from July 2012, then the
    First-tier Tribunal should have found that there  was  no  decision  in
    accordance with the law and allowed the appeal to that limited extent.

12. It was not clear to me that there can be two valid and extant decisions
    in relation to a single appeal. It may  be  that  the  latter  decision
    vitiates the earlier decision, in which case the Secretary of State may
    need to withdraw one or both decisions and make a fresh decision.

13. At the hearing before me on 3.7.14 both representatives concurred  that
    the appeal had been made against the decision of 20.2.13 and thus  that
    the decision of 21.2.13 was not relevant. Enquiries had  been  made  by
    the Secretary of State, but it was still not clear  how  the  purported
    decision of 21.2.13 came into being.

14. In the circumstances, I proceed on the basis that  the  decision  under
    appeal is that which related to consideration under Appendix FM.

15. In essence, the grounds of appeal of the Secretary of  State  are  that
    the judge erroneously considered at �13 that the Tribunal was bound  to
    conduct a two stage process of consideration under the Rules,  followed
    by consideration under article 8 ECHR. That is not a correct  statement
    of the law as it stood at the date of promulgation of the  decision  in
    March 2014.

16. In summary, the Tribunal need not consider article 8 outside the Rules,
    unless there are arguable good grounds for considering that  there  are
    compelling circumstances which would justify,  exceptionally,  allowing
    the application under article 8 on the basis that the decision produced
    a result that was unjustifiably harsh. The line of  authorities  begins
    with R (Nagre) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC
    720 (Admin), endorsed by the Court of Appeal in  MF  (Nigeria)  v  SSHD
    [2013] EWCA Civ  1192,  Gulshan  (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -  correct
    approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC),  and Nasim and others  (Raju:  reasons
    not to follow?) [2013] UKUT 00610(IAC), followed in respect of  article
    8 in Nasim & others [2014] UKUT25. Collectively, these cases have  held
    that the Immigration Rules are intended to be a complete code including
    for  consideration  of  article  8  family  and  private  life  rights.
    Latterly, Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC), held
    that the  new  Rules  are  a  complete  code  for  article  8  where  a
    consideration  of  exceptional  circumstances  and  other  factors  are
    required within the Rules. Only if "after applying the requirements  of
    the Rules, only if there may be  arguably  good  grounds  for  granting
    leave to remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes  to
    go on to  consider  whether  there  are  compelling  circumstances  not
    sufficiently recognised under them."


17. The First-tier Tribunal Judge was in error to consider at �13 that  the
    two-stage process  has  been  approved  in  the  Court  of  Appeal.  MF
    (Nigeria) in the Upper Tribunal was overturned in the Court of Appeal.


18. Thus before going on to consider article 8 ECHR, the judge should  have
    considered whether there were compelling  circumstances  insufficiently
    recognised in the Immigration Rules. However, Mr Shoeb  submitted  that
    the error was not  material  as  there  are  in  this  case  compelling
    circumstances justifying a consideration of article 8.


19. Without needing to set out the reasons why, is clear that the appellant
    could not meet the current Immigration Rules for settlement in the  UK,
    either under Appendix FM as a dependent relative, or private life under
    paragraph 276ADE.


20. I find for the  reasons  set  out  herein  that  there  are  compelling
    circumstances in this case, even if not identified as such by the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge, for going on to consider article 8 ECHR  and  thus
    there was no material error in doing so without first  identifying  the
    compelling circumstances.


21. The judge's assessment  of  the  evidence  as  a  whole  including  the
    historic injustice  aspect  of  the  appellant's  family  circumstances
    demonstrates that there are here such compelling circumstances that are
    insufficiently recognised in the Immigration Rules.


22. The appellant is the adult dependant child of a British Gurkha veteran.
    The judge  carefully  considered  the  circumstances  of  the  family's
    migration to the UK, leaving this  appellant  behind  to  continue  his
    studies in Nepal and perhaps also for financial reasons of being unable
    to afford to take him with them, though that  was  not  entirely  clear
    from the evidence. His mother remained with  him  until  2010  and  has
    repeatedly visited him for long periods of time, demonstrating that the
    family unit was continuing with emotional dependence of  the  appellant
    on his mother, even though he was 21 when his father and sister over 18
    left in 2008. His sister's application was granted even though she  was
    over 18 at the time. Perhaps most significantly, the judge  found  that
    but for the historic injustice done to his father, the appellant  would
    have been settled in the UK with  his  family  whilst  a  child.  I  am
    satisfied  that  these  can  properly   be   regarded   as   compelling
    circumstances insufficiently recognised in  the  Immigration  Rules.  I
    note that the Secretary of State had  discretionary  policies  to  deal
    with historic injustice applications,  in  recognition  that  this  was
    insufficiently recognised in the Immigration Rules.


23. Having conducted an article 8 family life assessment the  judge  found,
    for cogent reasons stated in the determination, that there  was  family
    and that the interference occasioned by the decision was sufficient  to
    engage article 8.  The  judge  then  proceeded  from  �21  to  consider
    proportionality.

24. The judge grappled with the Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA  Civ  31  issue
    from �17 and took into account the cultural norms in Nepal  that  adult
    children will often remain living in an extended family household until
    marriage. At �19 the judge concluded that the family had retained close
    ties despite the appellant being a mature adult, and that he is  wholly
    reliant on  his  father  for  financial  support  and  his  mother  for
    practical and emotional support. In effect, the  judge  concluded  that
    but for the  historic  injustice  the  appellant's  father  would  have
    settled in the UK at a time when the appellant would have been able  to
    accompany him as a dependent child under the age of 18. The judge  also
    concluded that the family unit was not broken up by  the  decision  for
    the appellant to remain behind to complete his studies.


25. In Ghising (family life -adults -Gurkha policy) [2012] UKUT 00160 (IAC)
    the Upper Tribunal held that there can be no blanket rule  with  regard
    to adult children and each case should be considered on its  own  fact,
    to decide whether family life exists within the meaning of  article  8.
    The historic injustice and its consequences suffered by former  members
    of the Brigade of Gurkhas are to be taken into account  when  assessing
    proportionality. Special provision has been made for entry  to  the  UK
    outside the Immigration Rules as an acknowledgement that it is  in  the
    public interest to remedy the injustice. The case suggests that  it  is
    not inherently unfair or in breach of their human rights to distinguish
    Gurkha veterans, their wives and minor children who will  generally  be
    given leave to remain, and their adult children who will only be  given
    leave to remain in  exceptional  circumstances.  The  scheme  that  the
    Secretary of State has developed is capable of addressing the  historic
    wrong and contains within it a flexibility  that  in  most  cases  will
    avoid conspicuous unfairness.


26. In Ghising and others (Ghurkhas/BOCs: historic  wrong;  weight)  [2013]
    UKUT 567 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal confirmed that  where  it  is  found
    that article 8 is engaged and that but  for  the  historic  wrong,  the
    appellant would have settled in the UK long ago, this  will  ordinarily
    determine the outcome of the article 8 proportionality assessment in an
    appellant's favour, where the matters relied on  by  the  Secretary  of
    State/Entry Clearance Officer consist solely of the public interest  in
    maintaining a  firm  immigration  policy.  They  will  not  necessarily
    succeed if the respondent can point  to  matters  over  and  above  the
    public interest in maintaining  a  firm  immigration  policy  (examples
    include a bad immigration history or criminal behaviour) which  may  be
    sufficient to outweigh the powerful factors bearing on the  appellant's
    side of the balance. At �22 the First-tier Tribunal Judge found no such
    compelling policy issues.


27. The judge took the principles established in these cases  into  account
    in the proportionality balancing exercise. The  judge  recognised  that
    had the appellant not been  the  adult  dependent  child  of  a  Gurkha
    veteran, there would be no particularly  compelling  circumstances   to
    justify granting the application outside the Immigration Rules, but  on
    the basis of those same principles, found no factors  to  outweigh  the
    increased weight to be  accorded  to  the  appellant  on  the  family's
    historic injustice circumstances. Of particular  signifiicants  is  the
    finding at  �23  that  but  for  the  denial  of  the  opportunity  for
    settlement when he was discharged from the  army  the  appellant  could
    have been settled in the UK as a child.


28. A different judge may have reached a  different  conclusion,  but  this
    judge has set out cogent reasons  for  concluding  that  the  there  is
    family life, that the decision  engaged  article  8  and  that  in  the
    proportionality assessment balancing exercise, the decision to  exclude
    the appellant was disproportionate.


Conclusion

29. For the reasons set out above, I find that there was no material  error
    in the making of the determination such as to  require  it  to  be  set
    aside.

Decision

The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  stands  and  the  appeal  remains
allowed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no award.

Reasons: No fee  was  payable  by  the  appellant  for  the  Upper  Tribunal
proceedings.
