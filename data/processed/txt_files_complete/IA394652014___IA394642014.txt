For the Appellants:    Ms C Bexson, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, HOPO


                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW

1.   The appellants are  both  nationals  of  Grenada  and  are  mother  and
    daughter.  They were born on 24 November 1968  and  13  September  2002
    respectively.  On 24 April 2013, they applied for leave  to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom on the ground of long residence, based on ten  years
    of residence in the UK.  On 9 January 2014 the respondent refused their
    applications.  The respondent withdrew her  decision  and  reconsidered
    their applications.  On 15 September 2014, fresh decisions refusing the
    appellants' application were issued together with directions for  their
    removal to Grenada.

2.   The appeals of the appellants against the  respondent's  decision  were
    dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Stokes.

3.   Both parties agreed that the judge's decision contained errors of  law.
     The first error was  that  the  judge  made  conflicting  findings  at
    paragraph 22.  The judge initially found that AA met  the  requirements
    of paragraph 276ADE(vi) since she was aged 12 and had  spent  the  last
    eleven years continuously living in the UK.  But  towards  the  end  of
    that  paragraph,  the  judge  concluded  that  AA  did  not  meet   the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE(iv).

4.   The second error was in respect of the  judge's  finding  at  paragraph
    21.

5.   The judge held as follows:

         "21. Ms Jackson conceded that  neither  appellant  could  meet  the
             requirements of paragraph 276B as they had both overstayed  by
             more than 28 days between 18 January  and  25  February  2011.
             The appellant has  remained  in  breach  of  immigration  laws
             contrary to  the  requirements  of  paragraph  E-LTRPT.3.2  of
             Appendix FM of the  Rules.   Since  she  does  not  meet  that
             eligibility requirement, paragraph  EX.1.(a)  does  not  apply
             even though AA meets the 7  years'  qualification  requirement
             since the paragraph is not free-standing: Sabir (Appendix FM -
             EX.1 not free standing) [2014] UKUT  00063  (IAC).   With  her
             mother's failure to obtain a grant of leave  to  remain  under
             the parent route it follows that AA is not eligible for  leave
             to remain under the child route."

6.   Ms Bexson submitted with arguable merit that EX.1 does apply  and  that
    E-LTRPT.3.2 is not the eligibility requirement for paragraph EX.1.  She
    submitted that E-LTRPT.3.2 is not applicable in this case.

7.   I agreed with Ms Bexson. Paragraph E-LTRPT 3.2 sets out  the  financial
    requirements an appellant must satisfy.  It is not applicable  in  this
    case and it is not the eligibility requirement for paragraph EX.1.

8.   In the light of the above  errors  which  I  consider  to  be  material
    errors, I find that the judge's decision cannot stand.  The decision is
    set aside in order to be remade.

9.   The appeal is to be remitted for rehearing at Taylor House by  a  judge
    other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Stokes.
