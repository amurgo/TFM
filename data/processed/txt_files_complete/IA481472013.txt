Representation:

For the Appellant/Secretary of State:    Mr T Melvin, Specialist Appeals
Team
For the Respondent/Claimant:               Mr G Davison, Counsel instructed
by Greater                                     London Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing on Article 8 grounds the claimant's
    appeal against the decision by the Secretary  of  State  to  refuse  to
    grant her leave to  remain  as  a  domestic  worker,  and  against  the
    Secretary of State's concomitant decision to make  directions  for  her
    removal from the UK pursuant to Section 47 of the 2006 Act. The  First-
    tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity order, and I  do  not  consider
    that such an order is warranted for  these  proceedings  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. The claimant is a national of the Philippines, whose date of  birth  15
    August 1983.  She entered the United Kingdom on  18  August  2012  with
    entry clearance as a domestic worker (visitor) that was valid until  23
    January 2013.  Her  previous  employer  in  Dubai  had  sponsored  this
    application.  The appellant says she was ill-treated by  this  employer
    in the UK, and she eventually ran away from her employer  in  order  to
    seek employment elsewhere.  A friend of hers helped  her  to  obtain  a
    position with a  new  employer,  Mrs  Baldwin,  as  a  housekeeper  and
    childminder, in October 2012.

 3. The claimant is recorded as having applied for leave to remain  outside
    the Immigration Rules on 14 November  2012.   The  covering  letter  in
    support of the application from the claimant's solicitors is  dated  20
    December 2012.  Her application was for leave to remain to  be  granted
    outside the Immigration Rules to work  in  a  private  household  as  a
    housekeeper for a period of twelve  months.   There  were  genuine  and
    compassionate grounds that ought to be considered by the  Secretary  of
    State in accordance with the Home Office policy on discretionary  leave
    to remain in the UK outside the Rules.  The solicitors referred to  the
    following passage in Pankina [2010] EWCA Civ 719 at paragraph 45:

         There appears to me, in this situation, to be no  escape  from  the
         proposition that  in  exercising  her  powers,  whether  within  or
         outside the Rules of practice for the time being in force, the Home
         Secretary must have regard  and  give  effect  to  the  applicants'
         Convention rights.  This will mean in  most  cases  evaluating  the
         extent and quality of their family and private life in  the  United
         Kingdom and the implications, both for  them  and  for  the  United
         Kingdom, of truncating their careers here.

 4. On 29 October 2013 the Secretary of State gave her reasons for refusing
    to vary the claimant's leave to enter the United Kingdom, and to remove
    her by way of directions under Section 47 of  the  Immigration,  Asylum
    and Nationality Act 2006.  The  Secretary  of  State's  policy  was  to
    consider granting leave outside the Rules where particularly compelling
    circumstances existed.  Grants of such leave were rare, and were  given
    only for genuine and compassionate reasons. After carefully considering
    her application for  leave  to  remain  to  continue  employment  as  a
    domestic worker, a category for which she did not meet the requirements
    of the Rules, the  Secretary  of  State  was  not  satisfied  that  her
    circumstances were such that discretion should be exercised outside the
    Rules.  The application was refused under paragraph 322(1) due  to  the
    fact that a variation of leave to remain was being sought for a purpose
    not covered by the Rules.  It had been considered whether EX.1  applied
    to her application.  She had spent 29 years in her home country, and in
    the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it was not  accepted  that
    in the period of time that she had been in the UK she had lost all ties
    to the Philippines.  Therefore she did not  meet  the  requirements  of
    Rule 276ADE(vi).

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The claimant's appeal came before Judge Canavan sitting at Taylor House
    in the First-tier Tribunal on 13 May 2014.   The  judge  received  oral
    evidence from the claimant and from her employer,  Mrs  Holly  Baldwin.
    The claimant said she sent around �1,000 to �1,200 to her family in the
    Philippines every month.  The remittances that she sent home had become
    even important  since  Typhoon  Hayan  devastated  many  parts  of  the
    Philippines in November 2013.  Her mother and two children were  wholly
    reliant on her  support,  as  well  as  her  three  sisters  and  their
    families.  A total of at least four  adults  and  eight  children  were
    reliant on the earnings that she was able to send them at  the  current
    time.

 6. In her subsequent determination,  Judge  Canavan  found  there  was  no
    breach of the claimant's right to private or family life under  Article
    8 "within the meaning given in the Immigration Rules".  She went on  to
    conduct a statutory human rights assessment.  At paragraphs 14  and  15
    she held that Article 8(1) was engaged.   Her  reasoning  was  that  in
    Niemitz v Germany [1992] 16 EHRR  97  the  European  Court  found  that
    private life included the right to establish and develop  relationships
    with other human beings and there  was  no  reason  why  it  could  not
    include activities of a business or professional nature.

 7. The claimant's length of residence, taken alone, would be  insufficient
    to engage her right to private life.  However, she worked in the UK and
    the income that she derived from that employment  was  crucial  to  the
    survival of a large number of family members in  the  Philippines.   As
    the European Court had confirmed  that  relationships  of  business  or
    professional nature might give rise to a private life that could engage
    the  operation  of  the  Convention,  she  found  the   appellant   had
    established a private life in the UK.

 8.  From  paragraph   16   onwards   she   addressed   the   question   of
    proportionality.   She  reminded  herself  at  paragraph  17  that  the
    Tribunal in Gulshan v SSHD [2013]  UKUT  referred  to  the  exceptional
    circumstances test set out in the Secretary of State's policy  guidance
    relating to consideration of Article 8 cases  outside  the  Rules,  but
    concluded that a breach was only  likely  to  be  found  where  a  case
    discloses "compelling circumstances" not sufficiently recognised  under
    the Rules.  The Tribunal went on to criticise the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  for  having  conducted  a  freewheeling  Article   8   analysis,
    unencumbered by the Rules.

 9. At paragraph 18, Judge Canavan observed that it is difficult to see how
    that test could be consistent with the principles  set  out  in  higher
    authorities such as Huang, Patel and MS Nigeria v SSHD [2013] EWCA  Civ
    1192, which are binding. In Patel and Others v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72  the
    Supreme Court had restated the principle set out in Huang v SSHD [2007]
    UKHL 11 that  the  Immigration  Rules  were  not  determinative  but  a
    starting point for the consideration of Article 8.  However, Article  8
    was not a general dispensing power and was to be distinguished from the
    Secretary of State's discretion to allow leave to  remain  outside  the
    Rules, which may be unrelated  to  any  protected  human  rights.   Mrs
    Huang's case did not turn on how closely she  had  come  to  compliance
    with the Immigration Rules but on the application of the family  values
    why underlay the rules relating to elderly dependent  relatives,  which
    also lay at the heart of Article 8.

10. At paragraph 19 the judge held that what became clear from  the  higher
    court authorities was that, in assessing whether refusal to grant leave
    to enter or remain outside  the  Immigration  Rules  was  proportionate
    under Article 8, the approach should  still  be  a  balancing  exercise
    conducted in accordance with Strasbourg principles.

11. At paragraph 20, the judge observed that it  was  unfortunate  for  the
    claimant that the Immigration Rules were not changed shortly before her
    arrival in the UK so by the  time  of  the  application  there  was  no
    provision for her to extend her leave to enter  as  a  domestic  worker
    with a new employer.

12. At paragraph 21, the judge attached  limited  weight  to  the  evidence
    given by Mrs Baldwin as to the reasons why she would like the  claimant
    to remain in her employ,  because  any  other  employer  in  a  similar
    situation would also want to retain a trusted employee if they lived in
    their home.

13. At paragraph 22 she  said  that  while  the  claimant  had  provided  a
    reasonable explanation for the course of events, (including her  reason
    for leaving her previous employer, and taking up  employment  with  Mrs
    Baldwin outside the Rules),  removal  would  otherwise  nonetheless  be
    proportionate because it became clear only a couple of months after she
    began working for Mrs Baldwin that she would not be able to extend  her
    visa under the Immigration Rules.

14. At paragraph 23 the judge held the most compelling factor in  the  case
    occurred after the claimant was refused further leave to remain.   This
    was the massive cyclone that hit  the  Philippines  in  November  2013,
    causing widespread devastation to  many  areas  of  the  country.   The
    claimant's family was amongst those who were  hardest  hit.   She  took
    into account the fact that even before  the  cyclone,  many  Philippine
    nationals sought to work abroad in order to  support  their  family  at
    home.  The conditions of the Philippines at the moment were  likely  to
    be particularly harsh.  As a result the income that  the  claimant  was
    currently earning and remitting to her family was of  more  than  usual
    importance.  She was supporting at least four adults and eight children
    who, even with her support, were living in a very precarious situation.



15. At paragraph 24, the judge found that aside from the fact the  claimant
    did not meet the requirements of the Rules, there were no other  strong
    public interest issues raised  in  this  case  that  might  compel  her
    removal e.g. abuse of the immigration system at the more serious end of
    the scale such as deception or use of false documents.  At the  hearing
    it was said the appellant was not asking for further leave to remain on
    a long-term basis but only seeking a limited period of leave  in  order
    to allow her time to remain in employment while  her  family  recovered
    their position in the Philippines.  A limited  period  of  leave  would
    also allow her time to consider what other options might be open to her
    in terms of future employment.

16. At paragraph 25 she said she had taken into account the  best  interest
    of  the  children  who  were  dependent  upon  her  support   and   the
    vulnerability of a large number of other dependent family  members  who
    were reliant on her  income  in  a  period  when  the  Philippines  was
    recovering from  the  devastation  caused  by  the  cyclone.   She  was
    satisfied that this factor was  sufficiently  unusual,  compelling  and
    compassionate to show that the claimant's removal at the  current  time
    would be disproportionate in all the circumstances of  the  case.   She
    went on at paragraph 26 to say the nature  of  her  findings  indicated
    that a limited period of leave to remain of at least twelve months  was
    likely to be appropriate  in  order  to  allow  the  claimant  time  to
    consider what other options might be open to her  in  terms  of  lawful
    routes to employment either in the UK or elsewhere.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

17. A member of the Specialist Appeals  Team  settled  an  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on behalf of  the  Secretary
    of State.  She raised four  grounds,  but  only  ground  3  and  4  are
    pertinent for present purposes.

18. Ground 3 was that the judge erred in finding that the claimant's  short
    period of work, coupled with her  remittances  to  her  family  in  the
    Philippines, was sufficient to engage Article 8.  Reference was made to
    paragraph 57 of Patel [2013] UKSC 72, where Lord Carnwath held  Article
    8 was to be distinguished from the Secretary of State's  discretion  to
    allow leave to remain outside the Rules, "which may be unrelated to any
    protected human rights".  The merits of a decision not to  depart  from
    the Rules are  not  reviewable  on  appeal:  Section  86(6).   One  may
    sympathise with Sedley LJ's call in Pankina for  common  sense  in  the
    application of the Rules to graduates who have been studying in the  UK
    for some years. However,  such  considerations  do  not  by  themselves
    provide grounds of appeal under Article 8,  which  are  concerned  with
    private or family life, not education as such.  The opportunity  for  a
    promising student to complete  his  course  in  this  country,  however
    desirable in general terms, is not in itself a  right  protected  under
    Article 8.

19. This ratio was applicable to a person's opportunity to work in the  UK.
    In Nasim and Others [2014] UKUT 25 (IAC) at paragraph 12  the  UT  held
    that Lord Carnwath's ratio in Patel served to "refocus  attention  upon
    the core purposes of Article 8".  Whilst the  claimant's  family  would
    suffer  detriment,  in  losing  their  remittance   income   at   least
    temporarily, the core social relationships  would  be  preserved.   The
    claimant would be able to work  in  the  Philippines,  or  in  a  third
    country, or in the UK if she qualified under the points-based system.

20. In Januzi [2006] UKHL 5  at  paragraph  19  Lord  Bingham,  considering
    internal relocation of refugee cases, said this:

         Suppose a person is subject to persecution for  Convention  reasons
         in  the  country  of  his  nationality.   It  is  a  poor  country.
         Standards of social provision are low.  There is a  high  level  of
         deprivation and want.  Respect  for  human  rights  is  scant.   He
         escapes to a rich country where, if recognised  as  a  refugee,  he
         would enjoy all the rights guaranteed to refugees in that  country.
         He could, with no  fear  of  persecution,  live  elsewhere  in  his
         country of nationality, but would there suffer all the drawbacks of
         living in a poor and backward country.  It would be strange if  the
         accident of persecution were to entitle him  to  escape,  not  only
         from that persecution, but from the deprivation to which  his  home
         country is subject.

21. The reasoning in Januzi at paragraph 19 was  applicable  to  the  ECHR.
    Applying Lord Bingham's analysis, it would be strange if the  operation
    of the  ECHR  were  to  mandate  that  the  claimant's  family  in  the
    Philippines should escape the deprivation  common  to  those  in  their
    locality.  The ECHR was not concerned with providing an opportunity for
    an applicant to guarantee to their family members resident outside  the
    territory of the contracting state a standard  of  living  higher  than
    that which would be enjoyed by similarly situated inhabitants of  their
    non-contracting territory.  Accordingly, the loss  of  opportunity  for
    the claimant to work as a domestic servant occasioned  by  the  removal
    decision did not have consequences of such gravity  as  to  engage  any
    Convention right to a private life.

22. Ground 4 was that the Tribunal erred in failing  to  accord  sufficient
    weight to the public  interest  when  assessing  proportionality.   The
    claimant's failure to meet the requirements of the Rules was a  weighty
    factor against the claimant  in  a  proportionality  evaluation.   Such
    Rules are calculated with particular regard to the  UK's  economy,  and
    the need - or lack thereof - for certain classes of labour demand to be
    met by way of economic migration.  In FK and OK  Botswana  [2013]  EWCA
    Civ 238, Stanley Burton LJ held that:

         The second reason is that the maintenance of immigration control is
         not an aim that is implied for the purposes of  Article  8.2.   Its
         maintenance is necessary in order to  preserve  or  to  foster  the
         economic wellbeing of the country, in order to protect  the  health
         and morals, and for the protection of the rights  and  freedoms  of
         others.  If there were no immigration control, enormous numbers  of
         persons would be enter this country, would  be  entitled  to  claim
         social security benefits,  the  benefits  of  the  National  Health
         Service, to be housed (or to compete for housing with those in this
         country) and to compete for employment with all those already here.
          Their children would be entitled to be educated at the tax payer's
         expense ... All such matters (we do not suggest they are  the  only
         matters) go to the economic wellbeing of the country.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

23. On 27 July 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Lambert granted the Secretary
    of State permission to appeal on ground 3 and 4:

         Taken with the judge's express concerns  in  paragraph  18  is  the
         degree of authority represented by Gulshan there is arguably a lack
         of the refocus of attention upon the core  purposes  of  Article  8
         presented by the UT in Nasim and Others [2014] UKUT 25 and lack  of
         weight attached to the claimant's failure to meet the  requirements
         of the Immigration Rules.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

24. At the hearing before me, Mr Melvin developed the arguments  raised  in
    ground 3 and 4 of the grounds of appeal.  Mr Davison mounted  a  robust
    defence of the determination, submitting that the  judge  had  directed
    herself appropriately, and that the grounds amounted to  no  more  than
    expression of disagreement with a conclusion that was  reasonably  open
    to the  judge  under  domestic  and  Strasbourg  jurisprudence.   In  a
    skeleton argument, he referred to Mukarkar [2006] EWCA Civ  1045  where
    the Court of Appeal said at paragraph 40:

         The mere fact that one  Tribunal  has  reached  what  may  seem  an
         unusually generous view of the facts of a particular case does  not
         mean it made an error of law, so as to justify an appeal under  the
         old system, or an order for reconsideration  under  the  new.   Nor
         does it create any precedent, so  as  to  limit  the  Secretary  of
         State's right to argue for a more restrictive approach in a similar
         case in the future.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

25. Judge Canavan's rehearsal of the applicable law is entirely sound, save
    arguably for her casting doubt on the Nagre threshold test approved  by
    the Upper Tribunal in Gulshan.  The Nagre/Gulshan line of authority has
    been approved at Court of Appeal level, inter  alia  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in Haleemudeen [2013] EWCA Civ 558, relevant passages from which
    are cited in ground 1 of the grounds of appeal in this case.

26. To answer the rhetorical question posed by Judge Canavan in the  course
    of her determination, the Nagre/Gulshan  line  of  authorities  can  be
    reconciled with, among other things, Lord Carnwath's speech in Patel by
    the simple fact that different types of Rule are  under  discussion  in
    the different lines of authority.  The focus in Patel, and the  earlier
    case of Pankina, is on what might be termed ordinary Immigration Rules,
    and in particular Rules covered by the points-based system; whereas the
    Nagre/Gulshan line of authorities are discussing the  interrelationship
    between (a) the codified Rules on family and private life contained  in
    Appendix FM and Rule 276ADE, and (b) what Aikens  LJ  in  MM  (Lebanon)
    characterised as a "further Article 8 claim" outside the Rules.  As the
    new Rules set out with great specificity how  the  Secretary  of  State
    considers the balance should be struck in  a  private  or  family  life
    claim, it is not the case  that,  where  these  Rules  are  potentially
    engaged, an applicant's failure to bring  himself  within  them  merely
    serves as a starting point for a consideration of an  Article  8  claim
    outside  the  Rules.   This  is  only  appropriate  where  there  exist
    compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under  the  Rules.
    This involves making a judgment on two questions, one  of  which  is  a
    question of fact, and the other of which is a question of law:  namely,
    whether there are compelling circumstances (a  question  of  fact)  and
    whether these compelling circumstances have a  human  rights  dimension
    which is not sufficiently recognised under the Rules relating to family
    and private life (a question of law).

27. Ground 1 was that the  judge  erred  in  law  by  failing  to  identify
    compelling circumstances not  sufficiently  recognised  under  the  new
    Rules so as to require the grant of leave to remain.  As the  Secretary
    of State was not granted permission to appeal on this ground,  I  shall
    put it to one side at this stage of the discussion.

28. Focusing on the judge's freestanding human  rights  assessment  outside
    the Rules, there was no error of law in the judge finding that  Article
    8(1) was engaged, applying Niemitz.  But when the judge came to conduct
    the balancing exercise at stage 5 of the Razgar test, the focus on  the
    Article 8(1) side of the  equation  needed  to  be  on  the  claimant's
    private life in the UK, and the gravity of the interference  with  that
    private life  consequential  upon  the  refusal  decision.   The  judge
    rightly attached little weight to  factors  relevant  to  that  private
    life, such as the relationship of trust which the claimant had built up
    with her employer.

29. The judge's egregious error was  to  attribute  decisive  weight  to  a
    factor which, on analysis,  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  claimant's
    private life in the UK at all.  Instead, it had everything to  do  with
    protecting and enhancing the private lives of the claimant's dependants
    in the Philippines.

30. Article 8 does not confer on an applicant the  right  to  work  in  the
    country of his or her choice.  As Article 8  does  not  afford  such  a
    right in the first place, such a right cannot be created simply because
    the purpose for which the applicant wishes to continue to be allowed to
    work is in order to remit money to needy family  members  living  in  a
    third country where standards of social provision are low, and there is
    a high level of deprivation and want.

31. The position of  the  dependent  children  in  the  Philippines  is  no
    different from the position of dependent adults.  They are  not  within
    the jurisdiction, and so there is no obligation on the part of  the  UK
    authorities to consider their welfare or best interest.  Nor was this a
    case where the children, although abroad, were seeking entry clearance,
    such as to trigger an obligation on the part of the state  to  consider
    whether refusal of entry clearance was contrary to their best  interest
    and hence disproportionate.  The claimant's family in  the  Philippines
    fell wholly outside the scope of  the  UK's  treaty  obligations  under
    Refugee Convention, the Human Rights Convention or  the  Convention  on
    the rights of the child.   So  basing  the  favourable  decision  under
    Article 8 on the proposition that the claimant needed to be allowed  to
    carry on working outside the Immigration  Rules  in  order  to  protect
    their interests was a manifestly impermissible deviation from the  core
    purposes of Article 8.  It follows that the proportionality  assessment
    was fatally flawed.

32. For the sake of completeness, it follows from what I  have  said  above
    that the judge also erred in law  by  failing  to  identify  compelling
    circumstances "not sufficiently recognised under the Rules" such as  to
    require the grant of leave to remain outside the Rules.  The  Rules  do
    not give an economic migrant the right to  work  in  order  to  support
    family members in the country of  origin,  even  where  their  economic
    circumstances in the country of origin are  dire.   The  question  then
    arises as to  whether  this  is  a  right  which  is  not  sufficiently
    recognised under the Rules, so as to create  an  arguable  case  for  a
    grant of leave outside the Rules.  The answer to this  is  plainly  no.
    This "right" is not recognised under the Rules for the very good reason
    that it is not a right which can  reasonably  be  derived  from  either
    domestic or Strasbourg jurisprudence on  the  operation  and  scope  of
    Article 8 ECHR.

33. In conclusion, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was vitiated  by
    an error of law, such that it should be set aside and remade.

The Remaking of the Decision

34. I am only asked to take into account one additional piece  of  evidence
    when remaking the decision.  Mr Davison informed me that  Mrs  Baldwin,
    the claimant's employer, was due to give birth  next  month,  and  that
    therefore the claimant would  be  required  to  look  after  the  other
    children.  I do not have any details about these children,  apart  from
    the fact that they are said to be minors.

35. I do not consider that this additional evidence changes the  landscape.
    I accept this is a factor which is pertinent to the balancing exercise,
    but I do not consider it adds much weight  to  the  claimant's  private
    life claim.  The original application was only  that  the  claimant  be
    allowed to stay in  the  United  Kingdom  for  another  year,  and  the
    claimant completed one year of  employment  with  Mrs  Baldwin  in  the
    autumn of 2013.  Both she and her employer have known for a  long  time
    that the claimant was not going to  be  a  permanent  presence  in  the
    household and that Mrs Baldwin  was  going  to  have  to  find  another
    housekeeper and carer in the near future.  The claimant has now had the
    benefit of earning a substantial salary for nearly two years,  although
    she entered on a visa which only permitted her to  work  here  for  six
    months, and moreover only permitted her to work for the  employer  whom
    she was accompanying from Dubai.  Under Section 117B of the  2002  Act,
    as amended by Section 14 of the Immigration Act 2014, little weight can
    be accorded to private life which has been built  up  in  circumstances
    where the person's right to enter or remain is precarious.  I find that
    the  interference  consequential   upon   the   refusal   decision   is
    proportionate to the legitimate end sought to be achieved.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the  claimant's  appeal  on
Article 8  grounds  outside  the  Rules  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the following decision is substituted: the claimant's appeal  is
dismissed.
