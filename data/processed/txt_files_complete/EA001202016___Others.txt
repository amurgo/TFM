                           Decision and Directions


 1. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal R C Campbell granted  the  appellants,
    nationals of Brazil born (respectively) on [ ] 1984, [ ] 2015, [ ] 2012
    and [ ] 2009, permission to appeal the decision of Upper Tribunal Judge
    Martin, sitting  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Immigration  &  Asylum
    Chamber),  who  dismissed  their  appeals  against   the   respondent's
    decisions of 14 December 2015 to refuse to  grant  them  EEA  residence
    cards as extended family members of Luis [S] (the "sponsor") under  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006  (hereafter  the
    "EEA Regulations").

 2. The respondent refused to grant EEA residence cards because she was not
    satisfied that the appellants had established that they  were  residing
    with and/or dependent upon the sponsor either immediately before  their
    arrival in the United Kingdom or since  their  arrival  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 3. Judge Martin dismissed the appeals on the ground  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to decide the  appeals  of  extended
    family members under the  EEA  Regulations.   In  this  respect,  Judge
    Martin relied upon Sala (EFMs:  Right  of  appeal)  [2016]  UKUT  00411
    (IAC).

 4. At the hearing, Ms  Brocklesby-Weller  informed  me  that  it  was  her
    understanding that, subsequent to the parties agreeing  to  settle  the
    appellants'  previous  judicial  review   claim   (JR/4452/2017),   the
    respondent had reconsidered the decision as she had undertaken to do in
    the consent order. She was also under the impression that the decisions
    dated 14 December 2015 had been withdrawn. I adjourned the hearing  for
    a short while so that Ms Brocklesby-Weller could confirm the  position.
    However, she was unable to do  so.  In  the  circumstances  and  having
    regard to the overriding objective,  I  decided  to  proceed  with  the
    hearing.

 5. Mr Krushner and Ms  Brocklesby-Weller  agreed  that  Judge  Martin  had
    materially erred in law, that her decision should be set aside and  the
    appeals remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.

 6. It is clear from the Court of Appeal's judgment in Court of  Appeal  in
    Khan [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 that the First-tier Tribunal  and  the  Upper
    Tribunal have jurisdiction  to  decide  appeals  from  extended  family
    members under the EEA  Regulations.  I  am  therefore  satisfied  that,
    through no fault of her own, Judge Martin materially erred  in  law  in
    dismissing the appellants' appeals  for  want  of  jurisdiction.  I  am
    satisfied that this led Judge Martin to fall  into  the  error  of  not
    deciding the disputed facts in this appeal, as summarised at my para  2
    above. I therefore set aside  the  decision  of  Judge  Martin  in  its
    entirety.

 7. In the majority of cases, the Upper Tribunal  when  setting  aside  the
    decision will re-make the relevant decision itself.  However, para  7.2
    of the Practice Statements for the Immigration and Asylum  Chambers  of
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  Upper  Tribunal   (the   "Practice
    Statements") recognises that it may  not  be  possible  for  the  Upper
    Tribunal to proceed to re-make the decision when it is satisfied that:

         "(a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
             First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for
             that party's case to be put to and considered  by  the  First-
             tier Tribunal; or

         (b)  the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
             necessary in order for the decision in the appeal  to  be  re-
             made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
             in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to  the  First-
             tier Tribunal."

 8. In my judgment this case falls within both para 7.2  (a)  and  (b).  In
    addition, having regard to the Court of Appeal's judgment in JD (Congo)
    & Others [2012] EWCA Civ 327, I am of the view that a remittal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal is the right course of action.

 9. If the respondent has withdrawn the decisions, the parties are directed
    to inform the First-tier Tribunal forthwith and, in any  event,  before
    the appeals are listed for hearing.

Notice of Decision

The decision of Upper Tribunal  Judge  Martin,  sitting  in  the  First-tier
Tribunal, involved the making of a material  error  of  law  such  that  the
decision to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction is set aside.

This case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing on  the
merits on all issues by a judge other than Upper Tribunal Judge Martin.
