Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born in 1946. He  appeals  with
    permission the 21st June  2017  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Gurung-Thapa) to dismiss his protection appeal.




    Anonymity Order


 2. This appeal concerns a protection claim. Having had regard to  Rule  14
    of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and   the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Background and Matters in Issue


 3. It is the Appellant's case that he is a member  of  the  Ahmadi  Muslim
    faith and that it is an important part of  his  religious  identity  to
    openly practice it. He asserts a well-founded fear  of  persecution  in
    Pakistan arising from these facts.  The Respondent disputes that  there
    is a real risk of serious harm. This was the central  matter  in  issue
    before the First-tier Tribunal.


 4. As  usual,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  required  to  consider  the
    credibility of the claim, any relevant country background evidence, the
    'country guidance' issued by the  Upper  Tribunal,  here  MN  &  Others
    (Ahmadis- country conditions  -risk)  Pakistan  CG  [2012]  UKUT  00389
    (IAC), and the applicable law.   In this case  however  the  Tribunal's
    task was further complicated by the fact that this was the  Appellant's
    second appeal against a refusal of protection. In 2012 he  had  claimed
    asylum and had been refused. His appeal against that decision had  been
    dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  de  Haney  in  a  determination
    dated 10th December 2012. As such the principles in Devaseelan  (Second
    appeals - ECHR- extra territorial effect) Sri Lanka [2002] UKIAT  00702
    applied. Since the Tribunal's treatment of Judge  de  Haney's  decision
    has some relevance to the appeal before me it  is  appropriate  that  I
    begin by setting out that decision in more detail.




    Decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge de Haney


 5. When Judge de Haney considered  the  Appellant's  appeal  in  2012  the
    Respondent had placed all of the Appellant's assertions in  issue.  The
    only element of the claim that was  accepted  was  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant is a Pakistani national born in 1946.  Judge de  Haney  heard
    live evidence from the  Appellant  and  read  his  witness  statements.
    Elements of the case put forward by the Appellant were the same then as
    they are today:


               . He is from Sialkot and he lived there until  1970  when  he
                 moved there for work;


               . He lived in Kuwait from 1970 until 2001 when he  spent  six
                 years in Saudi Arabia. He resumed residence  in  Kuwait  in
                 2007 until he retired in 2012;


               .  In  those  years  he  visited  Pakistan  on  a  number  of
                 occasions, usually staying for approximately two weeks;


               . He is an Ahmadi Muslim;


               . His last visit to Pakistan was in 2011 when he  stayed  for
                 two months in order to conduct some legal business relating
                 to family land;


               . He is now a widower and his children  live  in  the  United
                 Kingdom.


 6. Judge de Haney began his reasoning by finding that  the  Appellant  was
    not an Ahmadi. He had failed to produce any witnesses  supporting  this
    claim, which was surprising given the assertion that the Appellant  had
    three adult daughters living in this country,  all  of  whom  could  be
    expected to speak to their father's faith. Judge de  Haney  found  that
    their evidence - or lack of it - fell within  the  category  of  easily
    obtainable material discussed in TK (Burundi) v Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 40.  It was further noted that  the
    Appellant's passport does not identify him as an Ahmadi; Judge de Haney
    noted the objective evidence indicating that in those circumstances the
    Appellant must have signed a declaration, required by Pakistani law, to
    the effect that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Quadian is an "imposter".


 7. In the alternative Judge de Haney found that the Appellant has  on  his
    own account "lived a very low profile existence as an Ahmadi, [and] has
    denied his Ahmadi faith in order to have his passport  renewed  because
    being an Ahmadi would be 'inconvenient' to his work and life in  Kuwait
    and Saudi Arabia".  Applying the criteria in  MN  &  Ors  the  Tribunal
    dismissed the appeal.




    The Fresh Decision


 8. On the 3rd September 2012 the Appellant made  further  submissions  and
    asked that they be considered as a 'fresh claim'  for  protection.  The
    submissions included three letters in support from the Ahmadiyya Muslim
    Association (AMA) of the UK.  It was this new  material  that  led  the
    Respondent to accept, in her letter of the 21st March  2017,  that  the
    Appellant is in fact an Ahmadi Muslim and that as such his  submissions
    should be  treated  as  a  'fresh  claim'.  Having  accepted  that  the
    Appellant was Ahmadi the Respondent was not however satisfied  that  he
    faced a risk as a  result.  Curiously,  the  assessment  is  made  with
    reference to BA (Iran) CG [2011] UKUT 36 (IAC) and whether or  not  any
    of the Appellant's sur place activities had come to  the  attention  of
    the Pakistani authorities.




    The First-tier Tribunal Decision


 9. The determination summarises, in some  detail,  the  2012  decision  of
    Judge de Haney and the reasons for refusal letter. The evidence of  the
    Appellant and his daughter who appeared as a witness is then  set  out.
    Having evaluated that evidence  the  Judge  finds  there  to  be  three
    material discrepancies in their testimony. The Appellant asserted  that
    his daughter, son-in-law and their children were all attacked by Khatme
    Nabuwat in a restaurant in Pakistan in 2012. The same daughter, in  her
    evidence, denied that she and the children were present and stated that
    the incident only involved her husband and his friends.  The  Appellant
    now asserted that he had "faced many problems" in Kuwait as a result of
    his faith; he had not previously made any such claim and he had managed
    to live in Kuwait since 1970.   Finally,  the  Appellant  had  said  in
    evidence before Judge Gurung-Thapa that he had  tried  to  convert  two
    people whilst in Kuwait; he had previously described  these  encounters
    as conversations in which no attempted conversion was mentioned.


10. The determination then turns to address the  letters  from  AMA.    The
    Tribunal finds that these letters do not give further detail about  the
    nature of the  Appellant's  activities  here.   He  had  produced  some
    photographs depicting him giving out leaflets in Manchester, but by his
    own admission these had been taken for the purpose of the hearing.  The
    Tribunal found  it  reasonable  to  conclude  that  the  Appellant  had
    undertaken those activities solely to aid his asylum claim.


11. Turning to apply these findings to the country guidance given in  MN  &
    Ors, the Tribunal found as follows [at ï¿½57]:


         "I find that the appellant  has  failed  to  demonstrate  that  the
         restrictions on Ahmadis in Pakistan on the practise  of  his  faith
         are of particular importance to his religious identity and  he  has
         not  shown   either   an   intention   or   wish   to   defy   such
         restrictions...there is no issue of the appellant having to  modify
         his behaviour on return to Pakistan".


    The appeal was thereby dismissed.


    The Onward Appeal


12. It is now submitted on behalf of  the  Appellant  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred in several ways. In summary it is said that the Tribunal
    failed to correctly apply  the  guidelines  in  MN  &  Ors;  failed  to
    consider, in accordance with HJ (Iran) and HT (Cameroon) v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department  [2010]  UKSC  31,  the  reason  why  the
    Appellant might have been discreet about his behaviour  in  Kuwait  and
    Saudi Arabia; misunderstood the Appellant's evidence and failed to give
    reasons for rejecting the clear evidence of AMA that the Appellant  has
    been undertaking public expressions of his religious  identity  in  the
    UK.


13. The Secretary of State for the Home Department opposes  the  appeal  on
    all grounds.




    Discussion and Findings


14. MN & Ors establishes that decision-makers  must  ask  themselves  three
    questions when faced with claims  such  as  this  one.  First,  is  the
    appellant an Ahmadi? Second, is he able to demonstrate that  it  is  of
    particular importance to his religious identity to openly practice  his
    faith in Pakistan? That is a question to be answered with reference  to
    the behaviours listed at paragraph 2(i)  of  the  headnote  below.  The
    third question is whether, even if the answer to  Q2  is  negative,  he
    faces a real risk of serious harm as a result of his religious belief:



      1.        This country guidance replaces previous guidance in MJ &  ZM
         (Ahmadis - risk) Pakistan CG [2008] UKAIT 00033, and  IA  &  Others
         (Ahmadis: Rabwah) Pakistan CG [2007] UKAIT 00088. The  guidance  we
         give  is  based in part on the developments in  the  law  including
         the decisions of the Supreme Court in HJ (Iran) [2010] UKSC 31,  RT
         (Zimbabwe) [2012] UKSC 38 and the CJEU decision in Germany v. Y (C-
         71/11) & Z (C-99/11).  The guidance relates principally to  Qadiani
         Ahmadis; but as the legislation which  is  the  background  to  the
         issues raised in these appeals affects Lahori  Ahmadis  also,  they
         too are included in the country guidance stated below.

      2.         (i)  The  background  to  the  risk  faced  by  Ahmadis  is
         legislation that restricts the way in which they are able openly to
         practise their faith. The legislation not only prohibits  preaching
         and other forms of proselytising but  also  in  practice  restricts
         other elements of manifesting  one's  religious  beliefs,  such  as
         holding open discourse about religion  with  non-Ahmadis,  although
         not amounting to proselytising.  The  prohibitions  include  openly
         referring to one's place of  worship  as  a  mosque  and  to  one's
         religious leader as an Imam. In addition, Ahmadis are not permitted
         to refer to the call to prayer  as  azan  nor  to  call  themselves
         Muslims or refer to their faith as Islam. Sanctions include a  fine
         and imprisonment and if blasphemy is found, there is a risk of  the
         death penalty which to date has not been carried out although there
         is a risk of lengthy  incarceration  if  the  penalty  is  imposed.
         There is clear evidence that this legislation is used by  non-state
         actors to threaten and harass Ahmadis. This includes the filing  of
         First Information Reports (FIRs) (the first step  in  any  criminal
         proceedings) which can result in detentions whilst prosecutions are
         being pursued. Ahmadis are also subject  to  attacks  by  non-state
         actors from sectors of the majority Sunni Muslim population.

         (ii)    It is, and has long been, possible in general  for  Ahmadis
         to practise their faith on a restricted basis either in private  or
         in  community  with  other  Ahmadis,  without  infringing  domestic
         Pakistan law.

      3.         (i) If an Ahmadi is able  to  demonstrate  that  it  is  of
         particular importance to his religious  identity  to  practise  and
         manifest  his  faith  openly  in  Pakistan  in  defiance   of   the
         restrictions in the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) under  sections  298B
         and 298C, by engaging in  behaviour  described  in  paragraph  2(i)
         above, he or she is likely to be in  need  of  protection,  in  the
         light of the serious nature of the sanctions that potentially apply
         as  well  as  the  risk  of  prosecution  under  section  295C  for
         blasphemy.

         (ii) It is no answer to expect an Ahmadi who fits  the  description
         just given to avoid engaging in behaviour  described  in  paragraph
         2(i)  above  ("paragraph  2(i)  behaviour")  to  avoid  a  risk  of
         prosecution.

      4.         The need for protection applies equally to men  and  women.
         There is no basis for considering that Ahmadi women as a whole  are
         at a particular or additional risk; the decision that  they  should
         not attend mosques in Pakistan was made  by  the  Ahmadi  Community
         following attacks on the mosques in Lahore in  2010.  There  is  no
         evidence that women in particular were the target of those attacks.

      5.         In light of the above, the  first  question  the  decision-
         maker must ask is (1) whether the claimant genuinely is an  Ahmadi.
         As with all judicial fact-finding the  judge  will  need  to  reach
         conclusions on all the evidence as a whole giving  such  weight  to
         aspects of that evidence as appropriate in accordance with  Article
         4 of the Qualification Directive.  This is  likely  to  include  an
         enquiry  whether  the  claimant  was  registered  with  an   Ahmadi
         community in Pakistan and worshipped and engaged there on a regular
         basis. Post-arrival  activity  will  also  be  relevant.   Evidence
         likely to be relevant includes  confirmation  from  the  UK  Ahmadi
         headquarters regarding the activities relied  on  in  Pakistan  and
         confirmation from the local community in the UK where the  claimant
         is worshipping.

      6.        The next step (2) involves an enquiry  into  the  claimant's
         intentions or wishes as  to  his  or  her  faith,  if  returned  to
         Pakistan.  This is  relevant  because  of  the  need  to  establish
         whether it is of particular importance to the religious identity of
         the Ahmadi concerned to engage in  paragraph  2(i)  behaviour.  The
         burden is on the claimant to demonstrate that any intention or wish
         to practise and manifest aspects of the faith openly that  are  not
         permitted by the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) is genuinely held and of
         particular importance to  the  claimant  to  preserve  his  or  her
         religious identity.  The decision maker needs to evaluate  all  the
         evidence. Behaviour since arrival in the UK may also  be  relevant.
         If the claimant discharges this burden he is likely to be  in  need
         of protection.

      7.         The option of internal relocation, previously considered to
         be available in Rabwah, is not in  general  reasonably  open  to  a
         claimant who genuinely wishes to engage n paragraph 2(i) behaviour,
         in the light of the nationwide effect  in  Pakistan  of  the  anti-
         Ahmadi legislation.

      8.         Ahmadis who are not able to show that they practised  their
         faith at all in Pakistan or that they did so on anything other than
         the restricted basis described in  paragraph  2(ii)  above  are  in
         general unlikely to be able to show that their  genuine  intentions
         or wishes are to  practise  and  manifest  their  faith  openly  on
         return, as described in paragraph 2(i) above.

      9.         A sur place  claim  by  an  Ahmadi  based  on  post-arrival
         conversion or revival in belief and practice will  require  careful
         evidential analysis. This will probably  include  consideration  of
         evidence of the head of the claimant's local United Kingdom  Ahmadi
         Community and from the UK headquarters, the latter particularly  in
         cases where there has been a conversion. Any  adverse  findings  in
         the claimant's account as a whole may be relevant to the assessment
         of likely behaviour on return.

     10. Whilst an Ahmadi who has been found to be not reasonably likely  to
         engage or wish  to  engage  in  paragraph  2(i)  behaviour  is,  in
         general, not at real risk on return  to  Pakistan,  judicial  fact-
         finders may in certain cases need to consider whether  that  person
         would nevertheless be reasonably likely to be targeted by non-state
         actors on return for religious persecution  by  reason  of  his/her
         prominent social and/or business profile.


15. When the First-tier Tribunal came to answer those  three  questions  in
    this case, its starting point was the 2012 decision of Judge de  Haney.
    There can be no doubt that as a matter of  law  that  was  the  correct
    approach: see Devaseelan.  The complaint made by Mr Ahmed is  that  the
    Tribunal thereafter failed to appreciate the diminished  value  of  the
    2012 decision, in light of the evidential developments in the case.  In
    2012 the answer to all three questions was in  the  negative.   It  was
    Judge de Haney's rejection of the Appellant's claim to be  Ahmadi  that
    informed his approach to the second  question  posed  in  MN,  and  the
    disposal of question three.  When the present appeal came before  Judge
    Gurung-Thapa there had been a substantial shift in the  landscape.  The
    Secretary of State now accepted that  the  Appellant  was  in  fact  an
    Ahmadi and as such it was incumbent on Judge  Gurung-Thapa  to  conduct
    her own assessment of whether the Appellant considered it important  to
    his religious  identity  to  engage  in  the  behaviours  described  at
    paragraph 2(i) of the headnote to MN.


16. I do not doubt that Mr Ahmed is correct to say  that  this  is  a  case
    which would fall into one of the 'exceptions' set  out  in  Devaseelan.
    There had been a marked shift in the matters in issue  before  the  two
    Tribunals.   I am not however satisfied, on a holistic reading of Judge
    Gurung-Thapa's determination,  that  she  failed  to  appreciate  that.
    Although the findings of Judge de Haney are set out in some  detail  it
    is apparent that Judge Gurung-Thapa conducted her own assessment of the
    Appellant's evidence, that given before her and that given before Judge
    de Haney. Of note was the Appellant's evidence to Judge de  Haney  that
    he had encountered no problems in  either  Pakistan,  Kuwait  or  Saudi
    Arabia on account of his faith; he had denied  his  Ahmadi  faith  when
    renewing  his  passport  because  it  would  be  "inconvenient"  to  do
    otherwise; he had only discussed his faith on two occasions  whilst  in
    the Gulf, and on neither occasion  had  he  attempted  to  convert  the
    friend he was talking  to.    That  evidence  is  contrasted  with  the
    evidence that the Appellant now gave before Judge Gurung-Thapa, when he
    asserted that in  fact  close  family  members  had  been  attacked  in
    Pakistan, he had only denied his religion because he  was  in  fear  of
    persecution and he had faced many problems  whilst  living  in  Kuwait;
    he further said that  he  had  discussed  his  faith  on  a  number  of
    occasions with non-Ahmadis.  Those discrepancies in the  evidence  were
    such  that  Judge  Gurung-Thapa  was  entitled  to   characterise   the
    Appellant's  claim  to  have  preached  his  faith  in  Kuwait   as   a
    'fabrication' [at ï¿½45]. I am not  satisfied  that  she  simply  adopted
    Judge de Haney's conclusions without examining the fresh evidence.


17. The second ground is that the Tribunal erred in failing to consider why
    the Appellant might not have had any problems in Kuwait,  Saudi  Arabia
    or indeed Pakistan on his short  trips  home.  If  he  was  not  openly
    practising his faith it was incumbent on the Tribunal to consider  why.
    If any part of the Appellant's decision  was  informed  by  a  fear  of
    persecution, then that was relevant to the  assessment  of  his  future
    conduct.


18. Mr Ahmed is once  again  correct  in  his  analysis  of  the  law.  The
    difficulty was that in this case the evidence before Judge Gurung-Thapa
    did not enable her to join the dots in the way that Mr  Ahmed  contends
    she should.   There was no country background evidence  at  all  before
    the Tribunal about the position of Ahmadis in Kuwait or  Saudi  Arabia.
    Although I was asked to take judicial notice of the strictly  observant
    nature of those countries, it is not at all clear  that  the  same  was
    asked of Judge Gurung-Thapa. Nor is that a  matter  of  which  judicial
    notice can properly be taken. The AMA UK letter  of  the  5th  November
    2012 indicates that they were able  to  obtain  confirmation  from  the
    National President of the Community in Kuwait that  the  Appellant  had
    been an active  participant  in  community  programmes  and  a  regular
    financial contributor. This would rather tend to indicate  two  things:
    there is an Ahmadi community in Kuwait and that they  are  active.  The
    letter says  nothing  about  repression  or  difficulties.   There  was
    therefore no evidential  basis  upon  which  Judge  Gurung-Thapa  could
    properly have found that the Appellant acted  discreetly  in  order  to
    avoid persecution whilst living  in  the  Gulf.  More  importantly  the
    evidence from the Appellant was entirely unclear. He had told Judge  de
    Haney that he had experienced no difficulties in Kuwait;  before  Judge
    Gurung-Thapa he had said that he had experienced "many problems" there.
       There was, she found, also a  marked  discrepancy  in  his  evidence
    about his religious activities.


19.  The  'misunderstanding'  alleged  in  the  grounds  relates   to   the
    Appellant's production  of  some  photographs  which  depict  him,  and
    others, running a tabligh stall  outside  the  Manchester  Arndale  and
    holding up some leaflets in the  street.    The  determination  records
    that the Appellant had candidly admitted taking the  pictures  to  show
    the Judge. Mr Ahmed protests that this is an unfair characterisation of
    the evidence. The evidence was that the photographs had been  taken  by
    someone from AMA for the purpose of their own record and publicity, and
    the Appellant has asked  the  photographer  for  some  copies  for  the
    purpose of the appeal. I accept that it  is  quite  possible  for  such
    nuances  to  be  lost  in  the  course  of  evidence,  particularly  in
    translation. I am prepared to give the Appellant  the  benefit  of  the
    doubt on this point, since it seems unlikely that if the pictures  were
    entirely staged he would have admitted as much, or that he  would  have
    the support of AMA.


20. It is the AMA material that is the  subject  of  the  final  ground  of
    appeal. Mr Ahmed submits that  the  Tribunal  had  failed  to  properly
    assess this new material. The letters  from  this  organisation,  long-
    recognised by the Tribunal as an independent source of verification  in
    Ahmadi claims, had led to the Respondent accepting that  the  Appellant
    was in fact Ahmadi. That was the  extent  to  which  the  Tribunal  was
    prepared to rely upon them in its determination of the questions  posed
    in MN. Mr Ahmed contended that this was an  unreasonable  approach  for
    the following reasons.


21. The letters themselves spoke to  more  than  simply  the  fact  of  the
    Appellant's status as an Ahmadi.  They confirmed that  in  addition  to
    attending the mosque for prayers the Appellant  has in the UK  attended
    general meetings of the majlis, attended and provided security  at  the
    annual general meetings of AMA,  participated in a preaching  programme
    and run a tabligh stall in Derby and Manchester city  centres.  He  has
    participated in a charity walk.  AMA  described  the  Appellant  as  an
    "active and dedicated member" of their community who  attached  sincere
    importance to his ability to attend prayers  in  a  building  called  a
    'mosque', respond to the azan and openly  use  the  traditional  Muslim
    salutation. The Manchester branch confirmed that the Appellant had been
    involved in preaching by way of  distributing  leaflets.    Importantly
    AMA UK are also able to confirm that their Kuwaiti branch has a  record
    of the Appellant as having been an  active  participant  in  programmes
    there who regularly made financial contributions to the welfare of  the
    community.


22. Mr Ahmed submits that none  of  this  evidence  is  considered  in  the
    determination. Insofar as it could  be  inferred  from  the  Tribunal's
    negative findings on the question of proselytising that AMA's  evidence
    on this point is to be rejected, no reasons are given as  to  why  that
    should be. He further contends that the Tribunal  errs  in  failing  to
    make findings on any of the other 'paragraph 2(i) matters' set  out  by
    the AMA letters.  There is for  instance  no  finding  on  whether  the
    Appellant might regard it as fundamental to his religious  identity  to
    hear and answer the azan, or to pray in a building openly  referred  to
    as a mosque.


23. Although I fully accept that another Tribunal may have regarded the AMA
    evidence as determinative, there is no legal imperative to do so, and I
    cannot be satisfied that it was here ignored. The Respondent had  dealt
    with it in some detail in  the  refusal  letter  and  the  points  made
    therein are summarised  at  paragraph  21  of  the  determination.  The
    Respondent  was  unable  to  attach  any  significant  weight  to   the
    assertions about the Appellant's activities because the letters  lacked
    significant details including dates. At paragraph 50 the  determination
    notes that AMA had written a further letter, dated 18th May  2017,   in
    which the concerns of the Respondent  might  have  been  answered.  The
    contents were however similar to those submitted earlier, and  did  not
    give any further elaboration on the dates and frequency with which  the
    Appellant attended the events mentioned, what role he  actually  played
    or what charities he raised money for.  The conclusion, implicit if not
    express, is that the Judge shared the Respondent's concerns  about  the
    weight to be attached to the evidence of  the  Appellant's  activities.
    Weight is of course a matter for the Judge, and absent an  identifiable
    error in approach I am unable to find that it was a course not lawfully
    open to Judge Gurung-Thapa. See AB (Ahmadiyya Association UK:  letters)
    Pakistan [2013] UKUT 00511(IAC):



         44.  In  a  case  such  as  the  present  where  credibility  is  a
         significant issue,
         the more that a letter from the Ahmadiyya Association UK as to an
         individual's  activities  here  can  be  supported  with   specific
         information
         the more likely they are to  be  given  greater  weight.  We  would
         expect
         the Association to be in a position to explain the source of the
         information given in the letter, how the source is able to speak to
         such
         matters and what records are kept of the activities referred to  in
         the
         letter.


24. This was not a hopeless case by any means. The photographs and  letters
    of  AMA  certainly  supported  the  Appellant's  evidence  as  to   his
    activities in the UK, and of course confirmed that he lived as a member
    of the Ahmadi community in Kuwait.   The totality of the  evidence  was
    however such that the Tribunal was entitled to conclude that in respect
    of the second and third questions posed by MN & Ors, the Appellant  was
    cynically exaggerating his claim.   It being a  decision  open  to  the
    Tribunal, and no error of law having been identified,  I  am  bound  to
    dismiss the appeal.
