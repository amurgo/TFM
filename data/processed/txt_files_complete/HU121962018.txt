Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr N Howard, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                    DECISION AND REASONS ON ERROR OF LAW

    1. The appellant appeals with the permission of the First-tier Tribunal
       against a decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Lodge,
       promulgated on 29 January 2019, dismissing her  appeal  against  the
       refusal of entry clearance  to  join  her  daughter  in  the  United
       Kingdom as her adult dependent relative.


    2. The First-tier Tribunal had power to decide whether the decision was
       unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act  1998  because  the
       decision represented a disproportionate interference with the  right
       to family  life,  guaranteed  by  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
       Convention.  The notice of appeal raised Articles 2  and  3  of  the
       Human Rights Convention in addition to Article 8 but, rightly in our
       view, the First-tier Tribunal only considered Article 8.


    3. Judge Lodge accepted the appellant lives  in  Damascus,  Syria,  and
       that she suffers from  a  number  of  health  conditions,  including
       macular degeneration and "fibrillation" causing fluctuations in  her
       blood pressure  and  fainting.  He  heard  oral  evidence  from  the
       appellant's  daughter,  the  sponsor,  who  had  recently  met   the
       appellant in Turkey. It was explained that the sponsor cannot return
       to Syria because she is a  refugee.  In  terms  of  the  Immigration
       Rules, the judge was satisfied the appellant met the requirements of
       paragraph E-ECDR.2.4 of Appendix FM[1].

    4. The judge then turned to consider paragraph E-ECDR.2.5[2], which  he
       considered to be the "crux of this appeal". He heard  evidence  that
       the appellant had been receiving care from the wife of the guard  in
       her apartment block but that the arrangement could not continue  due
       to the person concerned having a baby. The sponsor  told  the  judge
       that she had tried to obtain care for the  appellant  but  had  been
       unsuccessful. Judge Lodge said at [33],

           "... Common  sense  tells  me  that  is  unlikely.  The  sponsor
           described $200 (which she gave her mother) as a very substantial
           sum of money in Syria and it  is  clear  given  the  amount  the
           grandson is sending from Saudi to the sponsor that  the  sponsor
           could ... if she so desired financially support her mother."

    5. The judge noted evidence from the sponsor's son that he is  employed
       as an engineer in Saudi and he provided  financial  support  to  the
       sponsor in the order of  �35,000  to  �40,000  per  year.   He  then
       continued,


           "35. I am satisfied the sponsor has the means available  to  her
           to pay for a carer in Syria. Her evidence was not to the  effect
           that she could not pay  for  help,  it  was  that  no  help  was
           available. I have no reliable evidence that  any  attempts  have
           been made to find carers for the appellant or indeed a care home
           for her. I appreciate that parts of Syria are in the  throes  of
           war, but I have no evidence that the  war  is  having  a  direct
           impact on the provision of carers. Common sense  tells  me  that
           employment must be in  short  supply  and,  in  the  absence  of
           reliable evidence that there are no carers or care homes,  I  am
           not prepared to accept that  with  the  financial  help  of  the
           sponsor the appellant could not obtain  the  required  level  of
           care in Syria.


           36. I add that I have no independent  evidence  to  support  the
           assertion that without the supervision of a close  relative  she
           will not be able to care for herself. The care that she  had  up
           until recently was not care from a close relative but  the  wife
           of the apartment block's guard."


    6. The judge, having found the rules were not met,  turned  briefly  to
       Article 8 outside the rules at [38]. He limited  himself  to  making
       the following assessment:


           "I am not satisfied that there are any exceptional circumstances
           in this case which require me to consider Article 8 outside  the
           rules. I  am  satisfied  that  failing  to  meet  the  rules  is
           sufficient in the circumstances of this case to  mean  that  the
           decision of the Secretary of State (sic) is proportionate having
           regard to Article 8."


    7. The appellant sought permission to appeal on three grounds which  we
       shall briefly summarise. Firstly, the judge erred by not taking into
       account the support provided to the sponsor  by  her  son  in  Saudi
       Arabia when considering whether there would  be  adequate  financial
       support for the appellant in the United Kingdom. Secondly, the judge
       had erred by not finding that the required level of care  would  not
       be available in Syria, which is a  war-torn  country.  Thirdly,  the
       judge had failed to carry out a proportionality  balancing  exercise
       and had erred in finding there were not exceptional circumstances.


    8. Permission was granted by the First-tier Tribunal on all grounds but
       with greater emphasis on the third ground.  It  was  arguable  that,
       given the circumstances of  the  case,  the  judge's  assessment  of
       Article 8 outside the rules was inadequate, although any error might
       prove to have been immaterial.


    9. The respondent filed a rule 24  response  opposing  the  appeal  and
       arguing that the judge had not shown how  Article  8.1  was  engaged
       because there did not appear to  be  any  family  life  between  the
       appellant and the sponsor.

   10. We heard oral submissions from the representatives as to whether the
       decision of Judge Lodge contains material errors of  law  so  as  to
       require us to set it aside.

   11. Mr Howard placed most reliance on the third ground and  the  absence
       from paragraph [38] of Judge Lodge's decision of any semblance of  a
       balancing exercise. He said  the  factors  which  should  have  been
       considered at that stage were that, (i) the sponsor  is  a  refugee,
       (ii) the appellant is the sponsor's mother, (iii)  it  was  accepted
       the appellant requires long term personal care to perform every  day
       tasks due to age, illness  or  disability,  (iv)  the  appellant  is
       living in war-torn Syria, and (v) she would not be a burden  on  the
       taxpayer due to the financial support provided by her grandson.

   12. Mr Howard sought to add to the grounds by arguing that the judge had
       erred by not considering the best interests of the appellant's minor
       grandchild, although he could not confirm that this point was argued
       before the judge or even that the appellant had met her grandchild.

   13. We drew Mr Howard's attention to the comment made in  the  grant  of
       permission  to  appeal  and  asked  him  to  address  the  issue  of
       materiality. We referred to the decision in Britcits v Secretary  of
       State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA  Civ  368,  in  which  the
       decision of the Administrative Court was upheld,  finding  that  the
       adult dependent relative rules  were  lawful.  Mr  Howard  said  the
       correct emphasis should be on the quality of care available and  the
       psychological factors in this case. By the latter we understood  him
       to be referring to appellant's need for emotional support, which  is
       currently provided by the sponsor. He reiterated  that  the  sponsor
       cannot visit the appeal is Syria because she is a refugee.

   14. Mr Howard could not assist  with  our  enquiry  as  to  whether  the
       appellant's grandson in Saudi Arabia is able to visit Damascus.

   15. Mr Melvin argued there was no material  error  in  the  decision  of
       Judge Lodge. The rules were not met and there  were  no  exceptional
       circumstances to  warrant  a  grant  of  leave  outside  the  rules.
       Alternatively, he argued  that  any  error  was  immaterial  to  the
       outcome of the appeal. He pointed out the rules provide for  a  high
       threshold for success.

   16. Mr Melvin relied on his rule 24 response in  which  he  argued  that
       Article 8.1 was not engaged because there was no family life in this
       case. We understood this as being part  of  his  argument  that  any
       error with regard to the application of the rules  and  Article  8.2
       could not be material.

   17. Mr Howard replied that the threshold for engaging  Article  8.1  was
       low.

   18. We reserved our decision as to whether the decision of  Judge  Lodge
       contains a material error of law.

   19. Having carefully considered the decision and the submissions made to
       us, we find the judge's decision does not contain any arguable error
       of law and the appellant's appeal must therefore be  dismissed.  Our
       reasons are as follows.

   20. We remind ourselves of the context.  The  Court  of  Appeal  in  the
       Britcits case  explained  the  policy  aims  behind  the  new  adult
       dependent relative rules. In his judgment, with which Davis  LJ  and
       Sales LJ agreed, the Master of the Rolls stated,
           "58. First, the policy intended to be implemented by the new ADR
           Rules,  as  appears  from  the  evidence,  the  new  ADR   Rules
           themselves  and  the  Guidance,  and  confirmed  in   the   oral
           submissions of Mr Neil Sheldon, counsel for the  SoS,  is  clear
           enough. It is twofold: firstly, to  reduce  the  burden  on  the
           taxpayer for the provision of health and social care services to
           those ADRs whose needs can reasonably and adequately be  met  in
           their home country; and, secondly, to  ensure  that  those  ADRs
           whose needs can only be reasonably and adequately met in the  UK
           are granted fully settled status and full access to the NHS  and
           social  care  provided  by  local  authorities.  The  latter  is
           intended to avoid disparity  between  ADRs  depending  on  their
           wealth and to  avoid  precariousness  of  status  occasioned  by
           changes in the financial  circumstances  of  ADRs  once  settled
           here.
           59. Second, as is apparent from the Rules and the Guidance,  the
           focus is on whether the care required by the ADR  applicant  can
           be "reasonably" provided and to "the required  level"  in  their
           home country. As Mr Sheldon confirmed in his  oral  submissions,
           the provision of care in the home  country  must  be  reasonable
           both from the perspective of the provider and the perspective of
           the applicant, and the standard of such care  must  be  what  is
           required for that particular  applicant.  It  is  possible  that
           insufficient attention has  been  paid  in  the  past  to  these
           considerations, which focus on what care is both  necessary  and
           reasonable for the applicant to receive in their  home  country.
           Those considerations include issues as to the accessibility  and
           geographical location of the provision of care and the  standard
           of  care.  They  are  capable   of   embracing   emotional   and
           psychological requirements verified by expert medical  evidence.
           What is reasonable is, of course, to be objectively assessed."
   21. This echoes what Mitting J had said in the  court  below  about  the
       policy rationale behind the rule change[3]. It was explained to  him
       by the senior civil servant responsible  for  the  delivery  of  the
       policy that primary consideration was given to the impact of the new
       rules on the taxpayer and, in particular, the burden imposed on  the
       taxpayer by the NHS.


   22. Mr Howard made no mention of the first ground seeking permission  to
       appeal, even though permission was given to argue all  grounds,  and
       we shall say no more about it other than that no  error  of  law  is
       found. The judge's findings in relation to the support  provided  by
       the appellant's grandson are clear.

   23. The second ground seeks to reargue the point as to  whether  the  E-
       ECDR.2.5 requirement was met.  The judge was  plainly  conscious  of
       the fact that Syria is afflicted by civil war.  However,  given  the
       level of funds available from the appellant's grandson and the  fact
       that care had already been accessed from the guard's wife, the judge
       was entitled to infer that there would be people willing and able to
       take a job looking after the appellant to a reasonable standard  or,
       if there are such places, that the appellant could be cared for in a
       residential home.

   24. We note the burden was on the appellant to show  that  the  required
       level could not be obtained even with the  practical  and  financial
       help of the sponsor  and  the  judge  recorded  that  there  was  no
       reliable evidence of attempts being made to find a suitable carer or
       care home. We  also  note  the  specified  evidence  rule  found  in
       paragraph 35 of Appendix FM-SE of the rules[4] places  a  burden  on
       the appellant to provide independent evidence of the  unavailability
       of care. We cannot see that any of the documents submitted with  the
       appeal bundle makes any reference to this.

   25. There is no error in the judge's assessment under the rules.

   26. The third ground does, in our judgment, disclose an error of law. It
       was incumbent on the judge to conduct  a  proportionality  balancing
       exercise. There is no threshold test for Article  8  to  be  engaged
       outside the rules. In R (on  the  application  of  Agyarko)  v  SSHD
       [2017] UKSC 11,  the  Supreme  Court  explained  that  the  ultimate
       question in Article 8 cases is  whether  a  fair  balance  has  been
       struck  between  the  competing  public  and  individual   interests
       involved, applying a proportionality test. The rules and IDIs do not
       depart from  that  position  and  are  compatible  with  Article  8.
       Appendix FM is said to reflect how the balance will be struck  under
       Article 8 so that if an applicant fails to meet the rules, it should
       only be in genuinely exceptional circumstances that there would be a
       breach  of  Article  8.  In  this   context,   'exceptional'   means
       circumstances in which refusal would result in  unjustifiably  harsh
       consequences for the individual so would not be proportionate.


   27. The brief paragraph devoted to Article 8 outside the rules by  Judge
       Lodge does not fulfil these basic requirements.  He appears to  have
       treated 'exceptional circumstances' as a gateway test before Article
       8 is engaged outside the rules, whereas  the  failure  to  meet  the
       rules is simply the starting-point for a wider-ranging  enquiry.  He
       does not refer to the public interest factors  set  out  in  section
       117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

   28. However, we do not consider the judge's error to have been  material
       because  we  cannot  conceive  that  a   structured   and   detailed
       consideration of Article 8 outside the rules would have delivered  a
       different result.

   29. On  the  appellant's  side  of  the  scales  are  the  circumstances
       mentioned by Mr Howard in his submissions, but it is entirely  clear
       to us that the judge already had these matters at the front  of  his
       mind. He was aware the sponsor is a refugee  and  cannot  visit  the
       appellant in Damascus. He recognised  that  Syria  is  afflicted  by
       civil war but also that not all parts of the country  are  similarly
       affected. We are satisfied that all these  matters  were  all  taken
       into account.

   30. Mr Howard raised the best interests of the appellant's grandchild in
       his submissions but this point was  not  raised  in  the  First-tier
       Tribunal and we do not consider the judge erred by  failing  to  set
       out reasons for not giving the issue weight. As  said,  it  has  not
       even been shown that the appellant has met this grandchild but, even
       if she did meet him during her visit to Turkey, there is no  legally
       sound basis on which it could be said the decision has  any  bearing
       on his best interests, which are presumably to continue residing  in
       the United Kingdom with his mother.

   31. We cannot see how, had the judge considered the public interest side
       of the scales, he could have come to any  other  conclusion  on  the
       facts  found  than  that  the  decision  was  a  proportionate  one.
       Paragraph E-ECDR.2.5 reflects the public policy aim of reducing  the
       categories of dependent relatives entitled to  come  to  the  United
       Kingdom so as to cut the cost of providing medical and  social  care
       services to them. The rule was not met and the finding that  it  was
       more probable than not that suitable  care  could  be  purchased  in
       Syria meant there were no unjustifiably harsh  consequences  arising
       from the decision. Should circumstances change and the appellant  be
       able to show she can meet all the requirements of  the  rules,  both
       substantive and evidential, then a fresh application can be made.

   32. We do not need to address Mr Melvin's point  about  whether  Article
       8.1 was engaged in this case.

   33. The appellant's appeal is dismissed.



NOTICE OF DECISION

     The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal did not make a material  error  of
    law and his decision dismissing the appeal  on  Article  8  grounds  is
    upheld.

[1] The applicant or, if the applicant and their partner are the sponsor's
parents or grandparents, the applicant's partner, must as a result of age,
illness or disability require long-term personal care to perform everyday
tasks.

[2] The applicant or, if the applicant and their partner are  the  sponsor's
parents or grandparents, the applicant's partner, must be unable, even  with
