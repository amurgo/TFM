                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Rothwell, promulgated on 25 March 2020,  dismissing
    their appeals against the refusal of Entry Clearance as the children of
    Ms Jezyl [P] (the "sponsor") who is married to Angrez [S], their  step-
    father.

 2. For the reasons set out in my decision promulgated on 17 November 2020,
    a copy of which is attached, I set that decision aside, stating:

    18.  Having set aside the decision, I now turn as to how it ought to be
    remade. Given the concession by the respondent set out in the  response
    of 18 August 2020, there now appears to be no longer any  doubt  as  to
    the level of the sponsor's income. The tax return shows the  additional
    income to be �27,026.00 from employment and a  profit  of  �4,335  from
    self-employment, presumably the cash in  hand  cleaning  job.  That  is
    consistent with her being paid �150 per week, as are the deposits  into
    her bank account noted by the judge. That equates to �678.84 per  week.
    Given that the level of the rent  is  �237.69  per  week,  that  leaves
    �441.50 per week, comfortably more than �333, the applicable  level  of
    income support that would be payable and on which the respondent relies
    in the refusal notice.

    19.  Given also the unchallenged evidence as to  the  adequacy  of  the
    accommodation both as to size and the  landlord's  permission  for  the
    appellants to live there, my preliminary view is that the appeal should
    be remade in the Upper Tribunal, allowing it, on  the  basis  that  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules are met, and that  therefore  the
    human rights appeals  ought  to  be  allowed,  there  being  no  public
    interest in refusal in such circumstances.

    20.  It is therefore my preliminary view that the appeal be  remade  in
    the Upper Tribunal on the basis of the material already  provided,  and
    in light of the respondent's concession and for  the  reasons  set  out
    above, it should be allowed without the need for a further hearing.


    21.  Accordingly, unless either party objects in writing  supported  by
    cogent argument within 10 working days of the issue of this decision, I
    will promulgate a decision, allowing the appeal without  a  hearing  on
    the basis of the above. In the absence of a timely response by a party,
    it will be presumed that it has no objection to the  course  of  action
    proposed.

 3. I then directed as follows:

    2.   It is my preliminary view that the appeal be remade in  the  Upper
         Tribunal on the basis of the material already provided and that  it
         should be allowed without the need for a further hearing.

    3.   Any objection to this proposed course of action must  be  made  in
         writing within 10 working days of the issue of this decision.

    4.   In the absence of a  timely  response  by  a  party,  it  will  be
         presumed that it has no objection to the course of action proposed

 4. There has been  no  response  to  these  directions  by  either  party.
    Accordingly, I am satisfied that neither party objects  to  the  matter
    being determined without a hearing and has nothing further  to  say.  I
    have therefore decided to determine the appeal without  a  hearing.  In
    doing so, I have borne in mind Rule 34 and the judgment of Fordham J in
    JCWI v President of the Upper Tribunal [2020] EWHC 3103 as well as  the
    order made in that case.

 5. For the reasons set out in my decision promulgated on 17 November  2020
    I am satisfied that that the determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    did involve the making of an error of  law  for  the  reasons  set  out
    above, and must therefore be set aside.  In the circumstances,  and  in
    line with the directions set  out  I  above,  I  am  satisfied  on  the
    evidence  provided  that  the  appellants  have   satisfied   all   the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.  Thus,

 6. For that reason, and  following  OA  and  Others  (human  rights;  'new
    matter'; s.120) Nigeria [2019] UKUT 65 (IAC), and in the absence of any
    indication from  the  respondent  that  there  are  any  other  factors
    militating against a grant of entry clearance, I am satisfied that  the
    refusal to grant Entry Clearance  is  in  breach  of  their  Article  8
    rights. I therefore allow the appeal on human rights grounds.

 7. Given the finding that the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  are
    met, it would be appropriate for the appellants to be granted leave  on
    that basis.

Summary of conclusions

     1. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making
        of an error of law and I set it aside.


     2. I remake the appeal by allowing it on human rights grounds.

                     ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER, SHEFFIELD
                                                                  Respondent




                            DECISION AND REASONS

 8. The appellants appeal with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Rothwell, promulgated on 25 March 2020,  dismissing
    their appeals against the refusal of Entry Clearance as the children of
    Ms Jezyl [P] (the "sponsor") who is married to Angrez  [S], their step-
    father.

 9. The application was refused by the respondent as he was  not  satisfied
    that the appellants could  be  accommodated  or  maintained  adequately
    without recourse to public funds. This was on the basis that there  was
    not sufficient evidence that the proposed  accommodation  was  in  fact
    available or was adequate; and, on the basis that there  would  not  be
    sufficient income to support the appellants, given that  the  available
    income,  less  costs  of  accommodation,  left  a  sum  less  than  the
    equivalent of income support that would be payable.

10. The respondent was not represented at the appeal; the  appellants  were
    represented by counsel and the judge heard evidence  from  the  sponsor
    and her husband. She also had before her a bundle of evidence.

11. The sponsor's evidence was that she earns  �27,500  gross,  working  40
    hours a week and that she earns �7800 in addition from casual work. She
    and her  partner  had  moved  to  new  accommodation  which  has  three
    bedrooms, the rent being �1030  per  month  inclusive  of  bills.   Her
    husband's evidence, as set out in his witness  statement,  is  that  he
    earns �12,000 per annum.

12. The judge accepted that the sponsor earned �27,500 but did  not  accept
    (a) that she earned an additional �7800 or (b) that her husband had any
    earnings, given the lack of documentary evidence.  The  judge  was  not
    satisfied either that there was sufficient income after payment of  the
    rent such that there was an amount left  greater  than  the  applicable
    amount of income support.

13. The judge was not satisfied  either  that  the  new  accommodation  was
    adequate as the tenancy agreement did not state the number of bedrooms,
    noting that the sponsor, her husband and her son aged 15 already  lived
    there, but that the tenancy agreement said a total of four  people  yet
    with the appellants there would be five people there.

14. The judge therefore concluded that the requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules could not be met and  that  the  public  interest  outweighs  the
    article 8 rights of the appellants and sponsor.

15. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had erred in law in that she:

          i) Had erred in not  taking  into  account  documentary  evidence
             handed up at the hearing confirming the  sponsor's  additional
             income and the sponsor's husband's income;

         ii) Had not, as a result,  properly  assessed  whether  there  was
             adequate maintenance which was achieved  taking  into  account
             only the full-time income of the sponsor and her  husband,  or
             the total income of the sponsor alone/

        iii) Had not taken into  account  the  letter  from  the  sponsor's
             landlord which confirmed that the property had 2 double and  1
             single bedroom and that he was content for the  appellants  to
             live there with their mother.

         iv)  Had  failed  to  consider  whether  there   were   compelling
             circumstances pursuant to paragraph 297 (i)(f) such  that  the
             appellants should be granted entry clearance;

          v) Had erred in her assessment of proportionality;

16.  The  grounds  do,  however,  take  over  16  pages   to   make   these
    straightforward points. Much of what  is  written  is  unnecessary  and
    confuses submissions with grounds of  appeal.  The  JOINT  PRESIDENTIAL
    GUIDANCE 2019 No 1: Permission  to  appeal  to  UTIAC  guidance  issued
    provides at [29]:

         29. It is reasonable to expect a professional representative to set
         out the basis of the application for PTA with an appropriate degree
         of particularity and legibility. The parties are under  a  duty  to
         assist the Tribunals in  their  overriding  objective  and  to  co-
         operate with them. For those reasons, a judge is entitled to expect
         that the grounds of appeal  should  set  out  in  simple  language,
         clearly and concisely why the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
         was wrong; that they address the relevant part of the decision  and
         the way in which it is said to be wrong in respect of each  way  in
         which the decision is said to be wrong.  A  judge  is  entitled  to
         point out where this has not been done;  the  judge's  role  is  to
         evaluate the claimed errors, not to read through  overlong  grounds
         padded out with unnecessary quotations from statute or case law  to
         discern if they disclose an arguable error.[emphasis added]

17. On 6 May 2020 first-tier Tribunal Judge Osborne granted  permission  on
    all grounds.

18. On 28 July 2020 Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek also made directions  in
    this case stating:

     1. I have reviewed the file in this case.  In the light of the  present
        need to take precautions against the spread  of  Covid-19,  and  the
        overriding objective expressed in the  Procedure  Rules[1],  I  have
        reached the provisional  view,   that  it  would  in  this  case  be
        appropriate to determine the following questions without a hearing:

        a)  whether  the  making  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
           involved the making of an error of law, and, if so

        b) whether that decision should be set aside.

     2. I therefore make the following DIRECTIONS:

         i) The appellant may submit further submissions in support of  the
            assertion of an error of law, and on the question  whether  the
            First-tier Tribunal's decision should be set aside if error  of
            law is found, to be filed and served on all  other  parties  no
            later than 14 days after this notice is sent out (the  date  of
            sending is on the covering letter or covering email);

        ii) Any other party may file and serve submissions in response,  no
            later than 21 days after this notice is sent out;

       iii) If submissions are made in accordance with paragraph (ii) above
            the party who sought permission to appeal may file and serve  a
            reply no later than 28 days after this notice is sent out.

        iv) All submissions  that  rely  on  any  document  not  previously
            provided to all  other  parties  in  electronic  form  must  be
            accompanied by electronic copies of any such document.

     3. Any party who considers that  despite  the  foregoing  directions  a
        hearing is necessary to consider the questions set out in  paragraph
        1 (or either of them) above must submit reasons  for  that  view  no
        later than 21 days after this notice is sent out and  they  will  be
        taken into account by the Tribunal.  The directions in  paragraph  2
        above must be complied with in every case.

     4. If this Tribunal decides to set aside the decision of the First-tier
        Tribunal for error of law, further  directions  will  accompany  the
        notice of that decision.

     5. Documents and submissions filed in response to these directions  may
        be sent by, or attached to, an email to [email] using the Tribunal's
        reference number (found at the  top  of  these  directions)  as  the
        subject line.  Attachments must not exceed 15 MB.  This  address  is
        not generally available for the filing of documents.  Service on the
        Secretary of State may be to [email] and to the original  appellant,
        in the absence of any contrary instruction, by use  of  any  address
        apparent from the service of these directions.


19. The appellants object to there being no hearing on the specious grounds
    that the appellants would wish to see the hearing. As they are  in  the
    Philippines, that would not ordinarily be possible, and  in  any  event
    the issues are straightforward, requiring little by  way  of  advocacy;
    either the judge took documents into account or she did not.

20. The respondent does not object to there being no  hearing,  and  indeed
    accepted that the sponsor's earnings for the tax  year  2019/2020  were
    �31,361 as disclosed in her Tax Return for that year, albeit that  this
    was not a document before the First-tier Tribunal. No issue is taken as
    to whether the judge did or did not fail to take into account  relevant
    documentary evidence.

21. The Tribunal has the power to make the decision without a hearing under
    Rule 34 of the Procedure Rules.  Rule 34(2) requires me to have  regard
    to the views of the parties.  bearing in mind the overriding  objective
    in Rule 2 to enable the Tribunal to deal with cases fairly and  justly,
    I am satisfied that in the particular circumstances of this case  where
    no objection to a decision being made in the absence of a hearing  that
    it would be right to do so.

22. It is evident from the grounds, drafted by counsel who represented  the
    appellants at the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, and the  material
    on file, that this experienced judge did, for some reason, fail to take
    into account relevant material relating to the income  of  the  sponsor
    and her husband, and as to the adequacy of the accommodation. Why  that
    is so, I do not know. It may well be that the fact  this  was  a  float
    case, without the assistance of the respondent, and the  imposition  of
    lockdown after the hearing on 11 March 2020 contributed to this.

23. The judge failed to take into account relevant evidence as regards  the
    husband's income, incorrectly stating that there was no evidence of it,
    and failed to take into account  relevant  evidence  in  assessing  the
    sponsor's cash in hand earnings. She also failed to take  into  account
    the letter from the landlord confirming the size of  the  property  and
    his consent to it being occupied by the appellants,  the  sponsor,  her
    husband and the sponsor's son.   That is  material,  as  the  evidence,
    taken  at  face  value,  demonstrates  that  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules are met.

24. For these reasons I set aside the decision; it is  unnecessary  in  the
    circumstances for me  to  consider  whether  the  judge  erred  in  her
    approach to paragraph 297 (i) (f) or proportionality.

25. Having set aside the decision, I now turn as to  how  it  ought  to  be
    remade. Given the concession by the respondent set out in the  response
    of 18 August 2020, there now appears to be no longer any  doubt  as  to
    the level of the sponsor's income. The tax return shows the  additional
    income to be �27,026.00 from employment and a  profit  of  �4,335  from
    self-employment, presumably the cash in  hand  cleaning  job.  That  is
    consistent with her being paid �150 per week, as are the deposits  into
    her bank account noted by the judge. That equates to �678.84 per  week.
    Given that the level of the rent  is  �237.69  per  week,  that  leaves
    �441.50 per week, comfortably more than �333, the applicable  level  of
    income support that would be payable and which the respondent relies in
    the refusal notice.

26. Given also  the  unchallenged  evidence  as  to  the  adequacy  of  the
    accommodation both as to size and the  landlord's  permission  for  the
    appellants to live there, my preliminary view is that the appeal should
    be remade in the Upper Tribunal, allowing it, on  the  basis  that  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules are met, and that  therefore  the
    human rights appeals  ought  to  be  allowed,  there  being  no  public
    interest in refusal in such circumstances.

27. It is therefore my preliminary view that the appeal be  remade  in  the
    Upper Tribunal on the basis of the material already  provided,  and  in
    light of the respondent's concession and for the reasons set out above,
    it should be allowed without the need for a further hearing.


28. Accordingly, unless either party objects in writing supported by cogent
    argument within 10 working days of the issue of this decision,  I  will
    promulgate a decision, allowing the appeal without  a  hearing  on  the
    basis of the above. In the absence of a timely response by a party,  it
    will be presumed that it has no  objection  to  the  course  of  action
    proposed.

       Tribunal on the basis of the material already provided  and  that  it
