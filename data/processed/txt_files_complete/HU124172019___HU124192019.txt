                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Thorne promulgated on 13  January  2020  dismissing
    the appeal against the Secretary of State 's  decision  to  refuse  the
    appellants (husband and wife) leave to remain on human  rights  grounds
    under Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE of the  Rules.  The  appeal  was
    heard on 9 December 2019.




    The application for permission to appeal.

 2. It was argued in the grounds of appeal  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge failed to consider material matters, made a material  mistake  of
    fact and acted procedurally improperly  and  procedurally  unfairly  by
    failing to consider the appellants' post  hearing  written  submissions
    and the additional documents filed with them,  which  had  been  filed,
    post hearing, on 18 December and that the judge mistakenly  found  that
    as of 7th January 2020 (the date  of  the  determination)  no  skeleton
    argument authorities had been received by him (paragraph 21),  when  in
    fact they had  been  submitted.   Had  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    considered  the  material  the  outcome  the  appeal  might  have  been
    different.

 3. The judge erred in failing to accept or consider the  material  and  to
    provide legally adequate reasons when addressing the arguments advanced
    in the appellant's written submissions filed on 18  December  2019  and
    identified in the appellants' oral submissions  at  the  hearing  on  9
    December 2020.

 4. There were two specific grounds.

 5. The first ground identified that the appellants' solicitors  filed  and
    served written submissions and further documents  in  relation  to  the
    second appellant's medical needs regarding her pregnancy on 18 December
    2019 and this was confirmed by the enclosed witness statement.

 6. Although the material was filed and served on 18 December and two  days
    after the seven day window  afforded  by  the  judge,  the  submissions
    explained the reasons for the delay.  The judge's  reasoning  suggested
    that had he been aware that the documents were filed on 18 December  he
    would have considered  them  and  further  the  judge's  reasoning  was
    predicated on an incorrect plea that "as at  today's  date  (7  January
    2020  -  the  date  of  the  determination)  no  skeleton  argument  or
    authorities has been received by me (sic)".

 7. The Tribunal was invited to consider this material which was  enclosed,
    and it was said  to  be  plain  that  had  the  written  argument  been
    considered, the judge might have reached a different conclusion and  at
    the very least the judge's reasoning would have been  different  as  he
    simply failed to understand  and  engage  with  the  substance  of  the
    appellant's position in the written submissions.

 8. The medical documents provided additional support to the first argument
    advanced and might have influenced the outcome of the  appeal  and  the
    judge simply failed to consider this evidence.

 9. As a result the judge acted procedurally unfairly  and  irregularly  by
    failing to take into account arguments advanced by the  appellants  and
    their attempt to rely upon further evidence and he failed  to  consider
    material matters because his reasoning was based on a material  mistake
    of fact that is that the submissions had not been filed.

10. It was irrelevant given the nature of the grounds that the judge  might
    have been blameless or that some other problem arose which  meant  that
    the documents did not reach the judge.

11. In the second ground, the appellants relied on arguments advanced on 18
    December 2019 with written submissions in support of  this  ground  and
    that the Tribunal was requested to consider this document in  full  and
    the arguments advanced are summarised below.

12. The two arguments were identified and raised in oral argument, but  the
    judge did not engage with them.  If he had done, these arguments  might
    have made a difference and they were as follows:

      1) The second appellant's pregnancy and medical  situation  meant  the
         appellants' family could not be expected to leave the  UK  for  the
         time being so that the appeal had to be allowed  applying  Sections
         84 to 86 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  as
         amended.

      2) The appellants had been the victim of an historic injustice in that
         the application for further leave  to  remain  made  by  the  first
         appellant on 1 September 2014 should have succeeded in the light of
         the evidence  now  properly  before  this  Tribunal.   The  earlier
         determination of the First-tier Tribunal was no  obstacle  to  this
         submission because applying the principles set out in Devaseelan  v
         SSHD [2002] UKIAT 00702 the previous findings and evaluation  could
         and must be departed from.

13. In relation  to  the  second  appellant's  pregnancy  and  her  medical
    situation, it was an important point of  principle  under  the  current
    statutory scheme that the judge is required to decide  whether  removal
    at the date of the respondent's decision appealed against  and  at  the
    date of the First-tier Tribunal determination, would breach Article  8.
    Further under the statutory scheme there was no need to  establish  any
    long or medium term entitlement to remain pursuant to the ECHR.

14. The correct approach for the judge was to consider the circumstances of
    the appeal at the time determination.  As  is  argued  in  the  written
    submissions and supported by the evidence adduced at the hearing  on  9
    December 2019 and further supported by the  additional  evidence  filed
    with the written submissions, it would be  disproportionate  to  expect
    the appellant's family to leave the UK during  the  second  appellant's
    pregnancy in all the circumstances and the judge  did  not  engage  and
    make all the required findings in respect of this argument.   It  would
    be disproportionate to expect the appellant's family to  leave  the  UK
    during the second appellant's pregnancy in all the circumstances.

15. The judge did not engage with all the required findings in  respect  of
    this argument and the judge's analysis was undermined by  the  material
    error of law.

16. The second argument was based on  the  manifest  error  which  was  now
    apparent in the respondent's and the First-tier Tribunal's decision  to
    find that the first appellant's business was not  genuine  and  so  his
    application for further leave to remain on 1  September  2014  did  not
    succeed.  Paragraph 30 of the judge's own reasoning entailed  that  the
    decision to refuse the  1  September  2014  application  was  incorrect
    because he acknowledged, as per paragraph 49,  that  the  business  the
    first appellant relied upon, was trading  and  therefore  was  genuine,
    contrary to the respondent's  decision  to  refuse  the  appellant's  1
    September 2014 application which was upheld by an earlier determination
    of the First-tier Tribunal.

17. As argued in the later  full  written  argument  the  evidence  clearly
    showed that this was so.  The judge failed  to  properly  consider  the
    legal implications of  this  and  the  determination  as  a  result  of
    overlooking the appellant's written submissions.

18. Whilst the judge made an adverse finding as to  the  first  appellant's
    credibility and character at paragraph 49, this could  not  answer  the
    argument under consideration.  The judge did not  factor  this  adverse
    manner in a sustainable analysis of the second argument advanced by the
    appellants.

19. The argument was not necessarily fatally undermined as a result of  the
    finding at paragraph 49.  Applying the  correct  legal  principles  and
    bearing in mind the arguments advanced in the 18 December 2019  written
    submissions  not  least  because  of  the  involvement  of  the  second
    appellant, the appeal should have been allowed.

20. The judge's determination was undermined by a material error of law.

    Rule 24 notice

21. The Secretary of State responded inter alia disagreeing that the matter
    could be dealt with on the papers and pointed out that  the  respondent
    did not have access to the file.

22. It was submitted that the fact that the  judge  did  not  consider  the
    further evidence submitted on 18 December was not material  because  at
    its highest the appellant's medical evidence was  that  she  could  not
    travel as of 18 December for the time being  not  that  she  could  not
    travel at all.

23. The appellant was seeking to rely on additional evidence concerning the
    business  that  overturned  a  previous  decision   of   the   Tribunal
    particularly on the flexibility of specified evidence.  At paragraph 69
    having considered the evidence the judge was entitled to find this  did
    not dislodge the previous decision.  As per the running of the business
    the judge did not find the appellant credible, at paragraph 49,  having
    heard the contradictory evidence from the appellant  and  the  witness.
    There was no historic injustice, and the other evidence did not support
    the appellant's assertions thereon.

24. In particular it was noted that the appellants did not challenge:

      a) The credibility of the appellants in the business.

      b) The ability of the appellant to obtain employment in Bangladesh.

      c) The appellants' family in France could support them on  return  and
         the appellants received financial support  from  Bangladesh  whilst
         being in the UK.

      d) The appellant would be able to  get  a  job  and  accommodation  on
         return.

      e) The appellants are able to speak the language.

      f) The appellants would be able to re-establish themselves on return.

      g) The appellant would not be at risk of persecution.

25. It submitted that if an error were found this did  not  impact  on  the
    other findings and they were sustainable.

The Hearing

26. At the hearing Mr Jorro submitted that the judge did not deal with  the
    Article  8  proportionality  exercise   because   of   the   procedural
    irregularity.  There was evidence submitted to the judge not considered
    and the procedural irregularity led to unfairness.  The permission  was
    granted on the basis of a failure to consider the  further  submissions
    although Mr Jorro accepted  that  the  pregnancy  had  been  successful
    because the child had been  born.   His  submissions  focussed  on  the
    historical injustice in relation to Section 85.  I pointed out  to  him
    that this had not been raised in the application to  the  Secretary  of
    State nor in the grounds of appeal, but Mr Jorro responded that it  had
    been raised in the oral submissions and the later  written  submissions
    albeit  these  had  not  been  submitted  on  time.   Nevertheless,  he
    submitted, there was a procedural irregularity.

27. Mr Jorro argued that the further submissions showed,  on  the  evidence
    now  available  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal   relating   to   the
    appellant's business having been registered for corporation tax in 2015
    and genuinely trading and generating income, that  the  respondent  had
    been wrong to conclude in January 2015 that the appellants had not been
    running a genuine business and this erroneous  conclusion  led  to  the
    refusal of Article 8.  The earlier decision of 2015 had made  a  series
    of findings in relation to Section 85 and the  exclusion  of  evidence.
    The provisions regarding the points-based system immigration  rules  at
    the time had now been amended and Section 85A was no longer  in  force.
    Mr Jorro observed  that  the  judge  could  depart  from  the  previous
    tribunal decision  and  with  regards  the  Article  8  proportionality
    assessment consider the historical injustice as per Ahsan  [2017]  EWCA
    Civ                                                               2009.






28. Mr Tufan submitted that even if there were an error of law there was no
    materiality.  He pointed to the need for finality in  litigation.   The
    2015 Tier 1 appeal was previously dismissed and  permission  to  appeal
    that 2015 decision was refused as was a Cart  Judicial  Review  by  the
    Court of Appeal.  At paragraph 30 of the First-tier  Tribunal  decision
    in 2015, the judge also found the appellant's ability to run  a  viable
    and credible business lacked credibility.  Even if the fresh  documents
    were looked at in terms of Article 8 that finding  would  still  stand,
    and those submissions could not have changed the final result  of  this
    case.  The fact that Section 85 was no longer in force could  not  mean
    that the previous decision was unjust.  In 2015, paragraph 41-SD(e)  of
    the Immigration Rules,  the  point  scoring  attributes  had  not  been
    satisfied and there was no justification to revisit this.  Ahsan was on
    a very different factual basis referring to cheating of the ETS and was
    a different issue.  Mr Tufan submitted that the judge should  not  have
    given those directions but there was no material error of law.

Analysis

29. In the oral submissions before the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Thorne
    there were two key aspects to the appellants' Article 8 claims.   First
    the second appellant was pregnant, and it was submitted she  could  not
    fly home to Bangladesh  or  receive  proper  treatment  there  for  her
    pregnancy and secondly, the "historical injustice" in relation  to  the
    previous 2015 First-tier Tribunal determination  dismissing  the  first
    appellant's visa application.

30. At paragraphs 13 and 14 the judge set out the following:-

         "13. He [the appellant] explained how on 01/09/14  he  had  applied
             for an  entrepreneur  visa  and  how  he  had  incorporated  a
             business, Blue Oceans Business Solutions Ltd (BOBS)  for  that
             purpose.  He said  that  he  invested  about  �51,000  in  the
             business.  R refused the application on 06/01/15.  His  appeal
             was dismissed by an  Immigration  Judge  after  a  hearing  on
             23/07/15.  A1 exhausted his appeal rights  on  01/02/16.   His
             subsequent judicial review application was refused by the High
             Court on 17/03/16 and subsequently  the  Court  of  Appeal  on
             26/04/17.  In the mean-time he made unsuccessful  applications
             under the Tier 2 visa Rules and the EEA Regulations.   He  had
             spent a lot of money on the IVF treatment and on these various
             applications and appeals.

         14.  In cross examination he said  that  BOBS  stopped  trading  on
             26/04/17 after the Court of Appeal decision.  He also accepted
             that he had no leave to remain in the UK since 2014.  He lived
             with A2 and paid �450 a month  in  rent  and  bills.   He  was
             unemployed as he was not permitted  to  work  in  the  UK  but
             relied on financial support from  A2's  cousin  and  a  friend
             called Philip Ruark-Davies had given  him  about  �3000  since
             January.  He described this as a gift.  A1 said  that  he  had
             savings of about �4000."

    Then at paragraph 21 Judge Thorne said the following:

         "21. I then heard oral submissions during which Mr. Biggs said that
             the appeals should be allowed on the basis of the difficulties
             of the appellants integrating in  Bangladesh  and  because  of
             A2's medical difficulties and IVF  treatment.   He  also  said
             there had been what he claimed was an "historic injustice"  in
             relation to the previous decision of the Immigration Judge and
             the decisions of  the  High  Court  and  Court  of  Appeal  in
             relation to the previous entrepreneur  visa  application.   He
             said this was similar to "the Gurkha cases".  He accepted that
             the "historic injustice" point  was  not  in  the  grounds  of
             appeal and apologized for not producing a skeleton argument or
             any of the authorities then sought to rely upon  and  that  no
             prior notice of this argument had  been  given  to  R  or  the
             Tribunal.  In the circumstances I allowed  an  adjournment  to
             allow him to serve a skeleton argument and  authorities  on  R
             and the Tribunal within 7 days and allowed  R  to  respond  if
             necessary by 06/01/20.  These directions  were  issued  orally
             and subsequently in writing by the Tribunal.   As  at  today's
             date no skeleton argument or authorities has been received  by
             me."

31. I make various points.  First, the Tribunal, in  the  lead  up  to  the
    appeal hearing, had issued a direction to the appellants on 9 September
    2019 in the following terms, "The appellant must  send  copies  of  all
    documents to the Tribunal and to  the  other  party  a  bundle  of  all
    documents you wish to rely on in support of  the  appeal  (sic)."   The
    direction clearly indicated that the documents on which  the  appellant
    tended to rely should be provided in time for the appeal hearing.

32. Secondly, the direction of  Judge  Thorne  related  to  the  historical
    injustice and not to the pregnancy of the appellant.

33. Thirdly, the direction of Judge Thorne had a deadline  of  16  December
    2019.  In the event Counsel's further submissions were  actually  dated
    18 December 2019 and faxed to  the  court  in  the  afternoon  of  18th
    December 2019.  There was no explanation in  the  submissions  for  the
    delay and merely attached, a statement from a solicitor Mr M Khan  that
    the submissions had been received from counsel on  18th  December  2020
    and faxed to the Tribunal.

34. Those submissions included an  attempt  to  re-argue  the  respondent's
    interpretation of the evidence at  the  hearing  and  attached  further
    evidence in the form of letters  from  the  Assisted  Reproduction  and
    Gynaecologist Centre dated 3 and 16 December 2019.   Neither  of  these
    letters made any reference to the second appellant's fitness to fly.

35. At the hearing before me Mr Jorro conceded that the appellants had  now
    had their child and thus the materiality in relation to  the  pregnancy
    of the child was not as it was in December  2019.   Mr  Jorro  did  not
    abandon this ground of appeal but sensibly chose not to pursue it  with
    the vigour that he might have done.   That said, the matter  was  fully
    considered by the First-tier Tribunal Judge Thorne at paragraphs 54  to
    56 of his determination.  The judge did  not  accept  that  the  second
    appellant would be unable  to  access  suitable  medical  treatment  in
    Bangladesh and  he  stated  there  was  simply  inadequate  independent
    reliable evidence about this.  Judge Thorne considered the letter  from
    the IVF centre dated 7 November 2019 and that it  stated  ...  "Due  to
    complications  associated  with  early  pregnancy  and  the   risk   of
    miscarriage it has been recommended that [A2] does not fly at present".
     It was open to the judge to conclude that this related  to  the  early
    stages of pregnancy  and  not  that  her  long-term  medical  condition
    prohibited flying throughout the pregnancy.  The judge was entitled to

         "...conclude that A has now passed the early stages  of  pregnancy,
         she has not proved on the balance of probabilities that there would
         be a risk of her returning to Bangladesh now or in the future".

36. On the evidence before the judge, his  interpretation  of  the  medical
    evidence was open to him in relation to both the future storage of eggs
    for IVF and in  relation  to  the  appellant's  medical  condition  and
    fitness to fly.

37. The appellants had been directed to submit relevant documentation prior
    to the Tribunal hearing and further had experienced  Counsel  to  argue
    the point on their  behalf.   There  was  no  requirement  for  further
    submissions and further medical evidence in relation to the appellant's
    pregnancy and I am not persuaded that  the  direction  from  the  judge
    encompassed  or  envisaged  any  further  submissions  or  evidence  in
    relation to the pregnancy or medical condition of the second appellant;
    the judge properly considered the evidence  before  him.   I  note  the
    submissions that  were  subsequently  forwarded  on  18  December  2020
    attempt to reargue  the  matter  taking  issue  with  the  respondent's
    submissions before the judge at the First-tier Tribunal hearing.

38. Mere disagreement about the weight to be accorded to  the  evidence  or
    the interpretation of the evidence which is  a  matter  for  the  judge
    should not be characterised as an error of law  further  to  Herrera  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018]  EWCA  Civ  412.   In
    this respect there was no procedural irregularity as  it  was  open  to
    Counsel to make full  submissions  at  the  hearing  when  he  had  the
    opportunity.  Thus the arguments  in  relation  to  proportionality  of
    removal  and  the  relevant   date   on   which   the   assessment   of
    proportionality should be made are otiose.  Further the  child  is  now
    born and if the matter were re-determined any error which I make  clear
    I do not find, would not be material.

39. I turn to the second aspect of the challenge and the challenge  to  the
    2015 decision.  Neither in the application to the  Secretary  of  State
    nor in the grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was  there  any
    mention of historical injustice.

40. The material parts of Section 85 of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 read as follows:

    "85. Matters to be considered

         (1)  An appeal under section 82(1) against the  decision  shall  be
             treated by the Tribunal as including  an  appeal  against  any
             decision in respect of which the  appellant  has  a  right  of
             appeal under section 82(1).

         ...

         (5)  But the Tribunal must not consider a  new  matter  unless  the
             Secretary of Status has given the Tribunal consent to do so.

         (6)  A matter is a "new matter" if -

             (a)  it constitutes a ground of appeal of  a  kind  listed  in
                  section 84, and

             (b)  the Secretary of State has not previously considered  the
                  matter in the context of -

                  (i)  the decision mentioned in section 82(1), or

                  (ii) a statement made by the appellant under section 120."

41. I can accept that the grounds of appeal raised Article 8 in relation to
    the appellants' private  life  but  as  conceded  at  the  hearing  and
    recorded by the judge the factual substance of the  claim  relating  to
    historical injustice was not raised until the hearing  itself  and  the
    Secretary of State did not consider this  matter.   The  judge  in  his
    final paragraph at 69 stated:

         "69. In addition I conclude that A1 has failed to establish that he
             is the victim of an "historic injustice" in  relation  to  the
             previous decision of the Immigration Judge and  the  decisions
             of the High Court and Court  of  Appeal  in  relation  to  the
             previous entrepreneur  application,  similar  to  "the  Gurkha
             cases".  I conclude that I have no grounds (or  power)  to  go
             behind the decision of the Immigration Judge and the decisions
             of the High Court and Court of Appeal in this matter.  I  also
             conclude that nothing in those judgements  or  the  subsequent
             correspondence to HMRC or documents concerning BOBS  establish
             valid grounds upon which I can allow the appeals  under  human
             right considerations."

    The judge correctly directed himself that he had no grounds upon  which
    he could allow the appeal under human rights considerations.

42. The judge indeed had no jurisdiction to consider a new  matter  without
    the consent of the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  because  as  the
    appellant's representative identified, historic injustice  was  not  in
    the grounds and there is no record  that  the  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer conceded that this matter should  be  admitted.   Even  if  the
    judge considered he had had power to do so, which he  did  not  without
    the consent of the Secretary of State, the judge had no jurisdiction to
    consider the matter further to Section 85.

43. Even if the judge had jurisdiction, although he invited the parties  to
    make submissions by 16 December  2019,  no  submissions  were  provided
    until 18 December 2019 and were thus outside  the  deadline  given  and
    without explanation for the delay.  Simply, those grounds had not  been
    properly put either to the Secretary of State nor to the judge  in  the
    appeal grounds, and when further submissions were submitted, they  were
    submitted late and without explanation for the delay.

44. SD (treatment of post-hearing evidence) Russia [2008] UKAIT 00037  held
    that

         'In the  rare  case  where  an  immigration  judge,  prior  to  the
         promulgation of a determination,  receives  a  submission  of  late
         evidence, then consideration must first be given to the  principles
         in Ladd v Marshall [1954] 1WLR 1489. Under those, a tribunal should
         not normally admit fresh evidence unless it  could  not  have  been
         previously obtained with due diligence for use at the trial,  would
         probably have had an important influence  on  the  result  and  was
         apparently  credible.  If,  applying  that  test,  the  judge   was
         satisfied  there  was  a  risk  of  serious  injustice  because  of
         something which had gone wrong at the hearing or this was  evidence
         that had been overlooked, then it was likely  to  be  material.  In
         those circumstances, it will be necessary either to  reconvene  the
         hearing or to obtain the written submissions of the other  side  in
         relation to the matters included in the late submission'.

45. This appeal did not fall into the rare category  as  described  in  SD.
    Additionally, there had been every opportunity prior to the hearing  to
    submit further evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  which  had  not
    been undertaken.

46. Even if it were conceded that, as a  new  matter  it  could  have  been
    considered, and even if the judge failed to consider submissions  (that
    were not before him), was that failure material?

47. The judge's view was that he had no grounds and  had  no  power  to  go
    behind the First-tier Tribunal of 2015.  In my view that  was  correct.
    The principle of res judicata and the finality  of  litigation  is  not
    ousted by Devaseelan v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2002] UKIAT 00702.

48. Although the grounds state that the submission  did  not  depend  on  a
    challenge to the August 2015 decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  as
    determined in accordance with the  then  applicable  law,  that  is  in
    effect what was being sought with new evidence being placed before  the
    Tribunal and it was in fact a departure from the decision of 2015  that
    was being requested.

49. In R (Boafo) v the Home Secretary [2002] EWCA Civ Auld LJ at  paragraph
    26 confirmed that an unappealed decision of an Adjudicator  is  binding
    on the parties.

50. The court, however, in TB (Jamaica) [2008] EWCA Civ 977 at paragraph 35
    observed

         "Of course, different considerations may apply where there is fresh
         evidence that was not available at the date of the  hearing,  or  a
         change in the law, and the principle has no application where there
         is a change in circumstances or there are new events after the date
         of the decision."

51. That said in AA (Somalia) [2007] EWCA Civ 1040,

         "12. I turn to LD (Algeria) [2004] EWCA  Civ  804,  also  known  as
             Djebbar, a decision dated  30  June  2004.  This  was  another
             second appeal case. An unsuccessful attack was made on  behalf
             of the appellant, LD, upon Devaseelan. The Court approved  the
             guidelines saying:

                  "30.      Perhaps  the  most  important  feature  of   the
                      guidance is that the fundamental obligation of  every
                      special adjudicator independently to decide each  new
                      application  on  its  own   individual   merits   was
                      preserved. The guidance was expressly subject to this
                      overriding principle."

         13.  The Court then set out part of  paragraph  37  of  Devaseelan,
             starting with the words:

                  "The first adjudicator's determination ... is not  binding
                  on the second adjudicator; but, on  the  other  hand,  the
                  second adjudicator is not hearing an appeal against it ...
                  the outcome of the hearing before the  second  adjudicator
                  may be quite different from what might have been  expected
                  from a reading of the first determination only.""

52. What is clear from these determinations is that it  is  possible  where
    there is a change in the law, for a second Adjudicator  to  make  fresh
    considerations but the second Adjudicator  is  not  hearing  an  appeal
    against that first decision and that in my view is what  the  appellant
    was attempting to do in this case.

53.  In  essence  it  was  submitted  that  because  Section  85A  of   the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 no longer  existed,  fresh
    evidence could be brought to revisit the 2015 decision. The  repeal  of
    Section 85A, however, does not have retrospective effect as can be seen
    from the material parts of Section 16 of the Interpretation Act 1978,

         (1)  Without prejudice to section 15, where an Act repeals an
         enactment, the repeal does not, unless the contrary intention
         appears,-

             (a)  revive anything not in force or existing at the time at
             which the repeal takes effect;

             (b)  affect the previous operation of the enactment repealed
             or anything duly done or suffered under that enactment;

             (c)  affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability
             acquired, accrued or incurred under that enactment;

             (d)  affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in
             respect of any offence committed against that enactment;

             (e)  affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in
             respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability,
             penalty, forfeiture or punishment;

         and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be
         instituted, continued or enforced, and any such penalty, forfeiture
         or punishment may be imposed, as if the repealing Act had not been
         passed.

54. Additionally, even if there were a change in the law, it  was  not  the
    case that the evidence to be brought forward was not available  at  the
    date of the appeal before the  Tribunal  in  2015;  it  was  not  fresh
    evidence.  Owing to the nature of the appeal the evidence had  to  have
    been in existence at the date of decision in 2015.  The application  to
    be decided by First-tier Tribunal Thorne was the Article 8 claim not  a
    rehearing of the 2015 decision which had already been appealed  to  the
    Court of Appeal.

55. However entirely separately from the point scoring attributes,  whereby
    the appellant could not enlist the aid of evidential flexibility  under
    paragraphs 41-SD, the judge in 2015 specifically identified that  there
    was a huge  discrepancy  between  the  appellant's  claimed  profit  of
    �147,000 and actual profit of �4,000 and thus  there  was  a  "lack  of
    credibility in terms of the appellant's ability to  run  a  viable  and
    credible business".  It should be noted that the appellant  was  appeal
    rights exhausted in the Court of Appeal and that  there  was  no  legal
    error found in that First-tier Tribunal decision of 2015.

56. This is not a case which  may  be  described  as  involving  historical
    injustice in terms of that described in  Patel  v  Secretary  of  State
    (historic injustice; NIAA Part 5A) [2020] UKUT 00351 (IAC).  There  was
    no  wrongful  'non-operation'  by  the  Secretary  of  State   of   her
    immigration functions.  The matter was properly  litigated  before  the
    courts under the relevant legal provisions in force at that time.   The
    First-tier Tribunal in 2015 applied the statutory provisions of Section
    85 and even found for positive reasons and from the  evidence  supplied
    by the appellant at that time, (the submission of the bank  statements)
    that the business venture was not credible.  That Section 85A  has  now
    been repealed does not undermine the decision in question.

57. Ahsan cannot assist the appellant and relates to an entirely  different
    factual matrix, a  different  part  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  a
    distinct set of facts.  Ahsan referred to TOEIC cases  where  appellant
    students (Tier 4 General) were accused  of  cheating  and  because  of,
    inter alia, the seriousness of that allegation the out of country right
    of appeal was considered an inadequate remedy, they were granted an in-
    country right of appeal for the facts to be considered.  Flowing from a
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal that an appellant had  not  cheated
    an appellant was entitled to be placed in a similar position as if  the
    Secretary of State's decision had not been made.   The appellant  here,
    in 2015, had applied for a Tier 1 Entrepreneur visa, was not accused of
    cheating but  simply that his business venture  was  not  found  to  be
    credible, and his case  can  be  distinguished  because  crucially  the
    decision was made in country by the First-tier Tribunal.

58.  In  any  event  the  further  submissions   referred   only   to   the
    documentation, the corporation tax registration already in  the  papers
    and the evidence of Mr Ruark-Davies.  The judge found the  evidence  of
    Mr Ruark-Davies to contradict that of the appellant with regard to  his
    business.  Furthermore, prior to stating he had no grounds or power  to
    consider this  matter,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Thorne  found  the
    evidence of the first appellant and  his  witness  Mr  Ruark-Davies  at
    paragraph 49 to be contradictory and lacking in credibility.  The judge
    specifically stated in relation to  the  first  appellant,  'I  do  not
    accept that he was an honest and credible witness about his income  and
    employment in the UK'.

59. Even if this were not a new matter, the submissions take  the  case  no
    further forward bearing in mind the  rejection  by  the  judge  of  the
    evidence of the appellant whom he found not credible and  the  relevant
    findings in 2015.  The Court of Appeal upheld that decision.   I am not
    persuaded that there was procedural irregularity not least because  the
    appellants failed to comply with the deadline  set  by  the  judge  but
    moreover because those submissions could not take the  matter  forward.
    As such I consider there to be no materiality to the alleged defect  or
    impropriety of a procedural nature in the proceedings at first instance
    as per MM (unfairness; E & R) Sudan [2014] UKUT 00105 (IAC).

60. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  will  stand  and  the  appeal
    remains dismissed.


No anonymity direction is made.
