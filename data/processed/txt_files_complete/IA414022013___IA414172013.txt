For the respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                    DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellants'  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Devittie promulgated 15.9.15,  dismissing  their  linked
    appeals against the decisions of the Secretary of State, dated 23.9.13,
    to refuse their applications made on 12.8.13 for leave to remain  as  a
    Tier 1 Entrepreneur (Mr Ashraf) and dependant  (Mrs  Waqar)  under  the
    Points Based System (PBS) of the Immigration Rules. The Judge heard the
    appeal on 15.8.14.

 2. The appeal has an unusual history. Permission to appeal was refused  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Lambert and when the application was  renewed
    to the  Upper  Tribunal,  permission  was  again  refused  on  18.3.15.
    However, Judicial Review proceedings were launched  and  permission  to
    apply for Judicial Review was granted by Mr Justice Collins on 21.5.15,
    stating: "I have  no  doubt  that  it  is  clearly  arguable  that  the
    construction of the Rules adopted by the FT Judge was wrong. It is also
    thoroughly undesirable that there should be  conflicting  decisions  in
    relation to the same provider particularly as it seems the Home  Office
    has not sought to appeal the decisions allowing appeals."

 3. In consequence, the decision of the Upper Tribunal to refuse permission
    to appeal was quashed by order of  30.6.15  and  on  21.7.15  the  Vice
    President granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, in  light
    of the decision of the High Court, the  Upper  Tribunal  stating,  "The
    parties are reminded that the Upper Tribunal's task is that set out  in
    s12 of the 2007 Act," meaning that the decision can only be  set  aside
    if it involved the making of an error of law.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 22.10.15 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein, I find no error of law in the making of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as to require the decision
    of Judge Devittie to be set aside.

 6. The relevant immigration background can be summarised as  follows.  Mrs
    Waqar  first  entered  the  UK  in  2006  with  leave  as  a   student,
    subsequently extended to 18.2.13. Her application for further leave  to
    remain as a student was refused on 21.2.13. Mr Ashraf first came to the
    UK in 2008 with leave as a student, valid to 30.4.09. In  2011  he  was
    granted leave to remain as a Tier  4  dependent  partner,  subsequently
    extended to 18.8.13. His application for further leave to remain  as  a
    Tier 4 dependent partner was refused on 21.2.13.

 7. In refusing the applications,  the  Secretary  of  State  awarded  zero
    points under Appendix A Attributes in  relation  to  access  to  funds.
    Under Table 4(b) the appellants claimed access to not less than �50,000
    from a  venture  capitalist  firm  (VCF)  regulated  by  the  Financial
    Services Authority (FSA), now renamed the Financial  Conduct  Authority
    (FCA), namely  BriceAmery  Capital  (BAC).  The  appellants  relied  on
    letters from BAC, dated 6.8.13, stating  that  �50,000  would  be  made
    available to Mrs Waqar. However, the Secretary of State did not  accept
    this evidence as the Financial Services Authority Register  (FSAR)  did
    not show that BAC has permission to operate  as  a  Venture  Capitalist
    Business (VCB) only. In consequence, the Secretary  of  State  was  not
    satisfied that Mrs Waqar had access  to  �50,000  from  an  appropriate
    source and refused the application.

 8. Mr Ashraf's application as dependent was refused in line with  that  of
    Mrs Waqar. Obviously, his appeal stands  or  falls  with  that  of  his
    partner.

 9. The appellants' case is that BCA is registered with the FCA and has the
    same permission on the Register as "some of the  other  most  prominent
    Venture Capital Firms in the UK. It is contended that  the  Immigration
    Rules and policy guidance do not state that a VCF should hold a licence
    to operation as a Venture Capital Firms  only  and  larger  firms  with
    broader range of financial services are ineligible.

10. Judge  Devittie  carefully  considered  the  Rules  and  in  particular
    Appendix A, noting that where funding is to be made  available  from  a
    VCF an applicant is required to provide  evidence  that  it  is  a  VCF
    regulated by the FCA. At �7 of the decision Judge  Devittie  cited  the
    FCA Handbook definition of a VCF as "a firm whose permission includes a
    requirement that it must not  conduct  designated  investment  business
    other than venture capital business." Noting that the FCA  Register  in
    respect of BAC shows that it does not meet this definition, and that it
    has permission to 'advise in investments only,'  and  that  the  letter
    from the firm's accountant does not claim that it is registered  as  or
    has permission to operate as a VCF, Judge Devittie  was  not  satisfied
    that the evidence adduced demonstrated  that  the  firm  and  thus  the
    appellants met the requirements of Appendix A.

11. According to Mr Iqbal's submissions, the appeal involves a narrow point
    of law, the definition of a 'Venture Capitalist Business' (VCB) for the
    purpose of the  Immigration  Rules.  However,  this  ignores  the  full
    reasons for both the refusal of the application and  dismissal  of  the
    appeal by Judge Devittie.

12. In addition to finding that BAC did not have the express permission  of
    the FCA to operate as a VCF, Judge Devittie also noted that it was  not
    apparent from the papers before the Tribunal that  the  accountant  met
    the requirements of Appendix A to  be  a  member  of  a  recognised  UK
    supervisory body.

13. There is also a further issue as to  the  evidence  admissible  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing. The  application  in  question  was
    made on 12.8.13. In a PBS  case  the  Rules  require  the  evidence  in
    support to be submitted with the application.  It  is  clear  from  the
    decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the  appellants  submitted
    further evidence, even after the refusal decision of 23.9.13, trying to
    demonstrate that BCA.

14. This is a PBS case in which the evidence in support must  be  submitted
    with the  application.  I  note  that  section  85A(4)(d)  states  that
    evidence may be considered if it is  adduced  in  connection  with  the
    Secretary of State's reliance on a discretion under immigration  rules,
    or compliance with a requirement of immigration  rules,  to  refuse  an
    application on grounds not related to the acquisition of "point"  under
    the "Points  Based  System,"  however  the  reasons  for  refusal  fall
    directly under the points requirements of Appendix A.

15. Even if the refusal was not directly based on a points  issue,  in  the
    recent case of Ahmed and another (PBS: admissible evidence) [2014] UKUT
    00365 (IAC), the panel including the Vice President held that "Where  a
    provision of the Rules (such as that in para  245DD(k))  provides  that
    points will not be awarded if the decision-maker is not satisfied as to
    another (non-points-scoring) aspect of the Rule, the non-points-scoring
    aspect and the requirement for points are  inextricably  linked.  As  a
    result, the prohibition on new evidence in s85A(4) of the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  applies  to  the  non-points-scoring
    aspect of the rule: the prohibition is in relation to new evidence that
    goes to the scoring of points."

16. At �5 of Ahmed, the Tribunal explained, "the purpose of that  provision
    is quite clear. It is that where a Points Based application is made and
    refused, the assessment by the judge is to be of the material that  was
    before the decision-maker  rather  than  a  new  consideration  of  new
    material. In other words the appeal if it is successful is on the basis
    that the decision-maker with the material before him should have made a
    different decision, not on the basis that a different way of presenting
    the application would have produced a different decision."

17. In Ahmed the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  erroneously  taken  into
    account "material other than that which was before the decision-maker."
    In the present case, Judge Devittie should not have taken into  account
    the further letter from BAC, which is dated  24.4.14,  obviously  after
    the submission of the application. On the basis of  the  principle  set
    out at �5 of Ahmed, there is no purpose in considering any further oral
    or documentary evidence at all.  Judge Devittie should have  considered
    the appeal on the basis only of the evidence before and  considered  by
    the Secretary of State when the decision was made in 2013.

18. The submission that BAC carries out activities which are those of a VCF
    as defined in the FCA Handbook is not determinative of the  issue.  The
    appellants  must  demonstrate  on  the  evidence  submitted  with   the
    application and on the balance of  probabilities  that  BAC  meets  the
    requirements under Appendix A. Paragraph  41-SD  was  substituted  from
    1.10.13 and various other amendments made in 2014, but all with savings
    for applications made before the dates of change. As in  force  at  the
    date  of  application,  41-SD(b)(i)(6)  of  Appendix  A  requires   the
    following  specified  document,  "if  the  third  party  is  a  venture
    capitalist firm, confirmation of whether this body is regulated by  the
    Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and is listed as permitted to operate
    as a Venture Capital  firm,"  as  well  as  a  recent  letter  from  an
    accountant who is  a  member  of  a  recognised  UK  supervisory  body,
    confirming the amount of money made available to the applicant.

19. The refusal decision is based on an assumption that the  register  must
    show that the VCF "has permission to operate as  a  Venture  Capitalist
    business only." The reference to "only" derives from the FCA  Handbook,
    which, according to the First-tier Tribunal decision, defines as VCF as
    a "firm whose permission  includes  a  requirement  that  it  must  not
    conduct designated  investment  business  other  than  venture  capital
    business," in other words, a VCF  must  only  conduct  venture  capital
    business.

20. In the Rule 24 response dated  21.8.15,  the  Secretary  of  State  has
    pointed out that under the FCA regulations a Venture  Capital  Firm  is
    defined as "a firm whose permission includes a requirement that it must
    not conduct designated investment business other than  venture  capital
    business."

21. At � 7 of the decision,  Judge  Devittie  observed  that  the  register
    showed that BAC had permission to 'advise  in  investments  only.'  "It
    does not show that the firm has authority to conduct a Venture  Capital
    business in terms defined in the handbook." The judge did not focus  on
    the 'only' part of the requirement but rather found that the  firm  did
    not have permission to conduct a venture capital business at all.

22. In any event, as Mr Iqbal's  skeleton  argument  asserts  at  �26,  the
    register states that BAC permission has no requirements,  and  thus  it
    must follow that it cannot meet the definition of the FCA Handbook,  as
    its permission does not include the necessary  requirement  restricting
    activity to venture capital business. The Rule 24 response  points  out
    that firms may be registered with permission to conduct venture capital
    business amongst other activities, but a VCF meeting the definition  of
    such in the FCA handbook is  restricted  to  venture  capital  business
    only. There is thus a distinction between  a  firm  which  carries  out
    venture capital business amongst other  activities  and  one  which  is
    defined by the FCA as a VCF, which must not conduct anything other than
    Venture Capital business.

23. It follows that on the evidence submitted  to  and  considered  by  the
    Secretary of State the appellants' failed to meet the strict but  clear
    requirements of Appendix A and paragraph 41-SD in relation  to  proving
    that BAC is a VCF.

24. Neither the grounds of application for  permission  to  appeal  nor  Mr
    Iqbal's skeleton argument address the failure to demonstrate  that  the
    accountant's letter  meets  the  requirements  of  paragraph  41-SD  in
    relation to membership of a supervisory body.  There  was  no  evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal of compliance with this requirement. The
    appeal would fail for this reason independently of the issue of  a  VCF
    registered with permission of the FCA as such.

25. In the circumstances, the failure of the appeal was inevitable. I  find
    no material error of law in the making of the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

Conclusions:

26. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal of each appellant remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.



Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
