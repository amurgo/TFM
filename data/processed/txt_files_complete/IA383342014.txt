Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Gill, instructed directly by the respondent


                  DISPOSAL OF PROCEEDINGS BY WAY OF CONSENT

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State I  will  refer  to
    the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. On hearing from Counsel for the appellant and  the  Presenting  Officer
    for the respondent and by the consent of the parties;

    IT IS ORDERED THAT:

    (1)    The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed, the  parties  having
         agreed that the First-tier Tribunal Judge made a material error  of
         law as set out in the respondent's grounds of appeal and the  Upper
         Tribunal considers it appropriate that such an  order  is  made  in
         accordance with rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
         Rules 2008.

2.    Accordingly this brings  to  an  end  the  proceedings  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.



Signed      Date 16 April 2015

A Grimes

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal
