                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant, a national of Turkey, has permission   to  challenge   a
    decision of First-tier Tribunal (FtT)  Judge  Mitchell  dismissing  his
    appeal refusing to grant indefinite leave to remain  as  a  businessman
    under the Turkey-European Community Association Agreement (ECAA).

2.   As agreed upon by both parties the FtT  judge  fell  into  clear  legal
    error in stating that he would not have regard to a number of  document
    produced for the hearing by the  appellant  as  he  considered  he  was
    statutorily excluded from doing so by  s.85(4)  of  the  NIAA  2002  as
    amended.  That provision only  applies  to  points-based  appeals.  The
    appellant was not a points-based appeal. Nor was  it  one  governed  by
    Immigration Rules that specify as a mandatory requirement that  certain
    specific documents  must be submitted with the application. Whilst  the
    judge did appear in one or two places to consider the further documents
    it is clear that he had already set  his mind against considering  them
    as a whole.



Notice of Decision

3.   For the above reasons, I conclude that the judge  materially  erred  in
    law and his decision must be set aside.

4.   The case falls within the ambit  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Statement on remittals and according I remit the case to  be  heard  by
    the First-tier Tribunal, before any judge other than Judge Mitchell.

No anonymity direction is made.
