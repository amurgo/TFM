For the Appellant:     Mr T Buley, counsel, instructed by Stephens Scown
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Fijiwala, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This appeal comes before me by way of  a  rehearing  following  the
         identification of a material error of law  by  the  Upper  Tribunal
         (UT) in the determination of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Kelly
         who allowed the  appellant's  appeal  against  a  decision  of  the
         respondent to refuse to vary her leave to remain on  the  basis  of
         her family life in the UK and to remove her from the United Kingdom
         under section 47 of the Immigration,  Asylum  and  Nationality  Act
         2006.

      2. The appellant is a national of Ghana, date of birth 16 August 1977.
         She met her husband, Mr Mark Kenwright, a British citizen, in Ghana
         in 2008. They married  in  May  2010  and  lived  in  a  number  of
         countries including South Africa  as  a  result  of  the  husband's
         profession as a geologist. Their first son, Mark Joseph,  was  born
         in Ghana on 24 June 2009 and their second son, Robert, was born  in
         South Africa on 18 November  2011.  By  reason  of  their  father's
         British citizenship both children are British citizens by descent.

      3. Following a previous visit in 2011 the  appellant  and  her  family
         entered the UK in November 2012, she as a visitor with  a  multiple
         entry visit entry clearance. Her husband obtained employment in the
         UK. Because of the  need  to  find  accommodation  and  make  other
         arrangements he only commenced  his  employment  in  January  2013.
         Their eldest son was  placed  in  a  private  nursery.  The  family
         returned to South Africa in April 2013, where they  had  previously
         lived pursuant to residence permits,  with  the  intention  of  the
         appellant  making  a  settlement  application.  They  were  however
         advised that it would take 3  months  for  the  application  to  be
         processed. As the appellant had been issued with a  multiple  entry
         visitor entry clearance they returned to the UK for the appellant's
         husband's employment and for her eldest's son's  schooling  and  on
         advice given to them by staff at the British High Commission (BHC).

      4. Having obtained legal advice  in  the  UK  the  appellant  made  an
         application on 28 August 2013 for leave to remain  outside  of  the
         immigration rules. This was refused on 17  September  2013  on  the
         basis that the appellant did not meet the requirements of  Appendix
         FM,  paragraph  R-LTRP.1.1(d)  and  EX.1  (prohibiting   her   from
         switching from visitor status to spouse status- the 'no  switching'
         provision).

      5. The First-tier Tribunal allowed her appeal on the  basis  that  the
         decision did not take  into  account  the  best  interests  of  the
         children and, adopting a classic Razgar/Huang approach,  the  Judge
         concluded that it would be disproportionate to expect the appellant
         to be  separated  from  her  children  while  she  makes  an  entry
         clearance application or to expect the children to live outside the
         UK.

      6. In an error of law decision promulgated on 07  October  2014  Upper
         Tribunal  Judge  Kekic  found  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
         materially erred in law. The First-tier Tribunal fell into error in
         concluding that the best interests of the  children  had  not  been
         considered because GEN.1.1 made specific reference  to  this  duty.
         The Judge failed to consider the fact that the appellant would  not
         need to make her entry clearance application from South Africa  but
         from Ghana, where she had family. Nor did the Judge  consider  that
         the appellant may only be away from her family for  a  short  time.
         The Judge had not given consideration to the fact that the children
         were young and had only spent a relatively short period of time  in
         the UK and would not be obliged to live in Ghana  permanently.  The
         Judge had not considered whether the appellant's husband  would  be
         able to accompany his family for a temporary period.  Nor  did  the
         Judge consider that the appellant, at least on  the  basis  of  the
         facts as understood by the UT Judge, appeared to make a  deliberate
         decision to come here to stay knowing that she had  no  entitlement
         to remain, and that she deliberately chose not  to  make  an  entry
         clearance application from Ghana because she  considered  it  would
         take too long. Having identified the above errors  the  appeal  was
         adjourned for a re-hearing.

The re-hearing

      7. The appellant and her husband each produced a further statement. At
         the hearing I received a letter from Margaret Lynes, the  husband's
         mother, in support of the application.  The  appellant  produced  a
         full bundle of documents  running  to  245  pages.  The  respondent
         provided  a  number  of  authorities,  copies   of   the   relevant
         immigration rules, and a skeleton argument. I heard  oral  evidence
         from the appellant and her husband. They both gave  their  evidence
         in English. I maintained a full  Record  of  Proceedings  which  is
         attached to the Tribunal file. The following is a  summary  of  the
         material evidence given at the hearing and the submissions made  on
         behalf of the parties.

      8. The appellant was the main carer for  her  children.  They  had  no
         nanny or paid carer. The youngest child was due to start nursery in
         September. Her children have never been away from her and she could
         not even imagine this. The appellant's mother-in-law lived 5  hours
         drive away. The children had never stayed with  their  grandparents
         alone. There was no-one else who could look after the children  and
         the appellant had no  other  family  in  the  UK.  The  appellant's
         husband frequently went on  international  trips  as  part  of  his
         employment. The appellant's father-in-law has not been well and the
         appellant could not see how her mother-in-law would be able to cope
         looking after the children and her husband. The children  would  be
         unable to attend school if they stayed with their grandparents.

      9. The appellant's parents lived in Ghana, and her father would be  70
         in August. The appellant's mother recently moved to a smaller house
         and  was  now  looking  after  her  own  mother.   There   was   no
         accommodation available from her family in Ghana. Should  she  have
         to return to Ghana the appellant would have to stay in a  hotel  or
         Bed & Breakfast accommodation. She did not know how long  it  would
         take to process a settlement application from Ghana,  but  believed
         it may take at least 3 months.

     10. In cross-examination the appellant reiterated that  her  mother-in-
         law could not take care of the children because she was caring  for
         her husband. When she last visited  Ghana  in  2012  the  appellant
         stayed in a hotel. The appellant explained that  when  she  entered
         the UK in April 2013 she still intended to return to  South  Africa
         and, to this end, even had tickets booked for August 2013. She  and
         her family had entered the UK in order to obtain  legal  advice  on
         her options. She explained that, when informed that it may  take  3
         months to process an application when she was in South Africa,  she
         had not wanted to be separated from  her  family  because  she  was
         still breast-feeding her youngest son and she could not stay in Bed
         & Breakfast accommodation with young children for 3 months.

     11. In re-examination the appellant explained that there  was  no  need
         for her to be in Bed & Breakfast accommodation as her  husband  had
         property in the UK. The staff at the  British  High  Commission  in
         South Africa told her that she could seek  legal  advice  once  she
         returned to the UK. The only reason she went to see a solicitor  on
         re-entering the UK was to find out what her options were  in  order
         to make a settlement application. The appellant reiterated that she
         had tickets to return to South Africa in August 2013.

     12. I asked the appellant how she believed her children would  feel  if
         she had to return to Ghana to make an entry clearance  application.
         At this point the appellant became very  emotional.  She  said  she
         could not leave her family and was  then  unable  to  give  further
         evidence. I have her some minutes to compose herself and  indicated
         I had no further questions to ask.

     13. In his oral evidence the  appellant's  husband  indicated  that  he
         worked full-time and that he regularly  travelled  abroad,  usually
         for a week to ten days at a time. There was no-one else in  the  UK
         who could look after the  children.  He  could  not  work  at  home
         because he was the Associate Director with  a  team  and  had  four
         other people working beneath him. He had to be in the  office.  His
         salary had now increased to �69,500 gross per annum. There  was  no
         way that his employers would be able to release him to  enable  him
         to look after his children. His mother and  step-father  were  both
         retired and were not  in  good  health.  His  step-father  recently
         underwent a neck and knee operation. His parents also had  pedigree
         cats who were not in good health.  His  parents  could  only  visit
         their grandchildren one at a time as someone had to stay  and  look
         after the cats. The children would be unable to  attend  school  if
         they stayed with their grandparents. It was not  possible  for  his
         parents to stay in his home to look after the children given  their
         own health issues.

     14. The husband indicated that he spoke to  officials  at  the  BHC  in
         South Africa who informed him that processing times for  settlement
         application can take between 3 to 6 months. The official  suggested
         the appellant and her husband seek legal advice in the UK. This  is
         what they did. When asked about the impact on their children if the
         appellant had to return to Ghana the husband  said  they  would  be
         devastated. They had never been away from their mother. This  would
         impact on their whole lives. The children would not understand  and
         would be bewildered.

     15. In response to questions put in cross-examination the husband  said
         that he did not know of any nanny who, were he to travel abroad for
         business, would be able to  look  after  the  children  for  24hour
         periods. The husband reiterated that  he  went  abroad  often.  His
         company had no contracts in Ghana.

     16. In submissions Ms Fijiwala  indicated  the  need  to  identify  the
         evidence to support a claim for a grant of leave outside the  rules
         (The Secretary of State for the Home Department v SS (Congo) &  Ors
         [2015] EWCA Civ 387). I had to look at the public interest  factors
         through the lens of the immigration rules. It was therefore in  the
         public  interest  that  visitors  were  not   allowed   to   switch
         categories. It was submitted that there were  no  other  compelling
         factors in the factual matrix presented by  the  appellant.  I  was
         referred to the public interest considerations in section  117B  of
         the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  (the  2002  Act).
         With respect to the authority of R(on the application  of  Chen)  V
         SSHD  (Appendix  FM  -   Chikwamba   -   temporary   separation   -
         proportionality) IJR [2015]  UKUT  189  (IAC),  paragraph  39,  the
         appellant had not shown that the entry clearance requirements  from
         abroad would have been met because  the  husband  did  not  have  6
         months worth of  pay  slips.  Nor  would  there  be  a  significant
         interference as a result of the temporary removal. It was submitted
         that the appellant's parents in Ghana could support her during  any
         application and there was no reason why the grandparents could  not
         look after the appellant's children while she made her  application
         abroad.

     17. Mr Buley submitted, in respect of the appropriate  legal  approach,
         that the effect of E-LTRP.2.1 was to cut off the balancing exercise
         from consideration. It was pointed out that the provisions  led  to
         the odd situation where someone who entered the  UK  illegally  and
         using deception could be in a  better  position  that  someone  who
         entered lawfully but who, as a result of a change in circumstances,
         wanted  to  switch  category.  With  respect  to  the  respondent's
         skeleton argument it was clear the only justification advanced  for
         the no-switching rule related to situations where individuals  used
         deception to enter the UK, but that was not  the  position  in  the
         present appeal. It was submitted  the  requirements  of  E-LTRP.1.1
         were not consistent with the case of Chikwamba (FC)  (Appellant)  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent) [2008] UKHL
         40. It was submitted that section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act  provided
         a  structured  approach  on  how  to  answer  the  public  interest
         question. It did not matter for how long a child had to  leave  the
         UK. If the child could not reasonably be expected to leave  the  UK
         the section did not contemplate separation as a possibility. It was
         submitted that the Secretary of State's guidance was not consistent
         with section 117B(6) as the latter only  merited  separation  of  a
         child from their parent in the context of a  deportation  decision.
         It was nevertheless submitted that the appellant complied with  the
         requirements of the guidance. It was submitted there was  no  basis
         for doubting the evidence from the appellant and her husband as  to
         the circumstances in which they came to make their application. The
         couple returned to the UK in 2013 with a view to working  out  what
         to do  in  the  long  term  and  to  discuss  their  position  with
         solicitors. Their application was made in  good  faith.  I  had  to
         consider the public interest in this context. Mr Buley reminded  me
         of the practical consequences of the  appellant's  separation  from
         her children and the impact on the children if they  were  required
         to return to Ghana with their mother.

     18. I reserved my decision.

Factual Findings

     19. There were no significant factual disputes in this appeal. I  found
         that the appellant and her husband gave their evidence in  a  clear
         and forthright manner. Their evidence was given in detail  and  was
         devoid of any inconsistency. While the provision  of  detailed  and
         consistent evidence is not determinative of credibility,  they  are
         factors I am entitled to take into account as being  indicative  of
         credibility. There was perceivable attempt at any  exaggeration  or
         embellishment in their evidence.

     20. I find that the appellant and her husband did approach the  BHC  in
         South Africa with a view to making  a  settlement  entry  clearance
         application. I accept  their  evidence,  consistently  given,  that
         staff at the BHC indicated that an application could take up  to  3
         months to process, and possibly more, and that they  were  advised,
         given  that  the  appellant  held  a  multiple-entry  visit   entry
         clearance, that she could  re-enter  the  UK  in  order  to  obtain
         professional legal advice. Both gave  a  detailed  account  of  the
         circumstances in which this advice was given and  the  account  was
         not challenged by Ms Fijiwala. I also accept that this option would
         have been reasonably attractive to the  appellant  given  that  her
         husband was in employment in the UK, her oldest son at nursery, and
         her desire not to be separated from her family while breast-feeding
         her youngest son. I am satisfied that the appellant re-entered  the
         UK as a genuine visitor still with the intention  of  returning  to
         South Africa to make an entry clearance application if required  to
         do so, even though she harboured the hoped that she would  be  able
         to remain here depending on the legal advice she obtained. I accept
         the appellant's evidence that her mother has  moved  to  a  smaller
         property in Ghana to  look  after  her  own  mother  and  that,  if
         removed, the appellant would have to reside in a  hotel  or  Bed  &
         Breakfast accommodation, as she did when she returned to  Ghana  in
         2012, for the duration of any entry clearance application.

     21.  I  find  that  the  appellant's  husband  is  still  in  the  same
         employment, that he currently earns a gross salary of  �69,500  per
         annum, and that he is  required,  as  part  of  his  job,  to  make
         frequent trips abroad for periods ranging  from  one  week  to  ten
         days. This evidence was not challenged by Ms Fijiwala.  I  am  also
         satisfied, having considered the evidence from both  the  appellant
         and her husband 'in the round', that the  husband's  parents  would
         not be able to care for the children for any length of  time  as  a
         result of their age, their  own  health  issues,  and  their  other
         commitments including their rearing of pedigree  cats.  This  would
         also prevent the grandparents from looking after  the  children  in
         the appellant's family home given that they are separated  by  a  5
         hour drive. Having considered the oral evidence from the  appellant
         and her husband I am  entirely  satisfied  that  even  a  temporary
         separation between her and her children would adversely  impact  on
         the well-being of the children and that the children are likely  to
         be very distressed by any such separation. I am satisfied that  the
         appellant does meet the English language requirements  of  Appendix
         FM, a point conceded by Ms Fijiwala at the hearing.

Legal conclusions

     22. It is not disputed that the  appellant  cannot  succeed  under  the
         immigration rules. Appendix  FM,  R-LTRP.1.2.1  requires  that  the
         appellant must not be present in the UK as, inter alia, a  visitor.
         EX.1 only applies if the appellant is not in the UK as a visitor (R-
         LTRP.1.1(d).

     23. Following a  long  line  of  authorities,  including  R  (Nagre)  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin),
         Singh v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA  Civ
         74 and SSHD v SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ  387,  in  order  for  the
         appellant to succeed in her application for leave to remain outside
         the immigration rules I must  be  satisfied  there  are  compelling
         circumstances not sufficiently recognised under those rules. As was
         stated in paragraph 44 of SS (Congo), "If  there  is  a  reasonably
         arguable  case  under  Article  8  which  has  not   already   been
         sufficiently dealt with by consideration of the  application  under
         the substantive provisions of the Rules  (cf  Nagre,  para.  [30]),
         then in considering that  case  the  individual  interests  of  the
         applicant and others whose Article 8 rights are in issue should  be
         balanced against the public interest, including as expressed in the
         Rules, in order to make an assessment whether refusal to grant  LTR
         or LTE, as the case may be, is disproportionate and hence  unlawful
         by virtue of section 6(1) of the HRA read with Article 8." This  is
         a fairly demanding test,  reflecting  the  reasonable  relationship
         between  the  rules  themselves  and  the  proper  outcome  of  the
         application of Article 8 in the usual run of cases (para 44  of  SS
         (Congo)).

     24. I am additionally obliged to take into account Section  55  of  the
         Borders, Citizens and Immigration Act 2009  which  requires  me  to
         have regard to the need to safeguard and  promote  the  welfare  of
         children who are in the United Kingdom. In  ZH  (Tanzania)  v  SSHD
         [2011]  UKSC  4  the  Supreme  Court  held  that,  "In  making  the
         proportionality assessment under article 8, the best  interests  of
         the child must be a primary consideration.  This  means  that  they
         must be considered first." What is required by consideration of the
         best interests of the child  is  an  "overall  assessment"  and  it
         follows that its nature and outcome must be reflected in the  wider
         Article 8(2) proportionality  assessment  (MK  (best  interests  of
         child) India [2011] UKUT 00475). E-A (Article 8 - best interests of
         child) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 315 (IAC)  indicated  that  the  correct
         starting point in considering the welfare and best interests  of  a
         young child would be that it is in the best interests of a child to
         live with and be brought up by his or  her  parents.  I  take  into
         account that GEN.1.1 of Appendix FM  indicates  that  the  Appendix
         takes into account the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of
         children in the UK in line with section 55, but I also note that in
         JO and Others (section 55 duty) Nigeria [2014] UKUT 00517 (IAC)  it
         was stated that the  duty  imposed  by  section   55  requires  the
         decision-maker to be properly informed of the position of  a  child
         affected by the discharge of an immigration etc function, that  the
         decision-maker must conduct a careful examination of  all  relevant
         information and factors, and that the question whether  the  duties
         imposed by section 55 have been duly performed in  any  given  case
         will invariably be an intensely fact sensitive and contextual one.

     25. Having given careful consideration to the totality of the  evidence
         before me I am satisfied, for the following reasons, that there  is
         a reasonably arguable case under Article 8  that  has  not  already
         been sufficiently dealt with by consideration under the immigration
         rules, and that there are, on the particular facts  of  this  case,
         compelling  circumstances  sufficient  to  render  the  appellant's
         removal disproportionate under Article 8.

     26. It is possible for a  range  of  different  factual  circumstances,
         either  individually  or  cumulatively,  to  meet   the   demanding
         'compelling' threshold and  therefore  justify  a  grant  of  leave
         outside the immigration rules. In the present appeal I identify the
         following factors, which, when considered holistically,  constitute
         compelling circumstances.

     27. In MS v SSHD [2013] CSIH 52 Lord Drummond Young indicated, at [30],
         that the purpose of  those  provisions  of  the  immigration  rules
         giving expression to Article 8 was to set  out  the  factors  which
         normally apply to  the  Article  8  assessment  in  an  immigration
         context; "... consequently both the terms of those  provisions  and
         the underlying policy that can be discerned from those terms are of
         importance.  They must, of course, be  weighed  against  the  other
         special considerations that apply in the particular case."

     28. The justification, and therefore the underlying  policy,  proffered
         by the Respondent for the 'no switching' rule  in  the  context  of
         Appendix FM is that it aims to prevent abusive applications. As was
         recognised in the UT error of law determination, "The Secretary  of
         State's view that visitors should not be permitted  to  switch  and
         that those who seek to abuse and evade  the  rules  should  not  be
         rewarded for such actions are also important considerations."   The
         respondent's skeleton argument, served at the commencement  of  the
         re-hearing, explained that the tough approach taken in  respect  of
         visitors is due to the specific nature of the visitor  visa,  which
         is  time  limited  and  is  for  a  specific  purpose   only.   The
         respondent's skeleton argument stated that the UK  needs  to  guard
         against  those  abusive  applications  who  deliberately  seek   to
         circumvent the minimum income threshold and gain entry on the basis
         of 'deception'. It was claimed in the skeleton argument that  those
         granted visitor visas on the basis that they satisfied the ECO that
         their intention was to visit the UK only and  return  at  the  end,
         would have used deception in their applications for a visitor visa.



     29. This may well be true of a large  number  of  visitor  applications
         where a person never intended to enter or remain as a visitor.  But
         it is not true of the present appellant.  I  have  found,  for  the
         reasons given above, that she genuinely entered, and re-entered the
         UK as a visitor. I find that she always intended to comply with the
         conditions attached to her enter clearance and that she did not, at
         any stage, exercise any  deception.  On  my  factual  findings  the
         appellant re-entered the UK in  April  2013  pursuant  to  a  valid
         visitor entry clearance following advice given to her by  staff  at
         the  BHC  in  South  Africa  and  with  the  intention  of  seeking
         professional legal advice in the UK as to the options available  to
         her. She still intended to return to South Africa if so advised and
         had purchased return tickets to this end. Her application  was  not
         an abusive application  but  one  made  in  good  faith  after  the
         provision of legal advice. In  this  regard  I  accept  Mr  Buley's
         submission that if there is no deception  in  an  individual  case,
         then the public interest underling the 'no switching' rule  is  not
         present. I find this to  be  one  factor  that  can  amount  to  an
         exceptional or compelling  circumstance  on  the  particular  facts
         before me. In so doing I have specifically  considered  the  public
         interest  in  the  no  switching  rule  through  the  lens  of  the
         immigration rules  and  note  that  her  inability  to  satisfy  R-
         LTRP.1.2.1 remains a matter of substantial significance.

     30. A further factor that I consider amounts, on the  particular  facts
         of the present case, to a compelling circumstance,  is  the  actual
         impact on the children if  the  appellant  is  separated  from  her
         family. To this end I have  considered  the  possibility  that  the
         appellant may only be away from her family for a  short  period  of
         time.

     31. There was no evidence before me in respect of the processing  times
         for settlement applications from Ghana. However, even on the  basis
         that the period of separation from  her  family  would  only  be  a
         matter of weeks, I find this would nevertheless have a considerable
         impact on all the family members, and  in  particular  on  her  two
         young children. Having  observed  the  appellant  and  her  husband
         giving evidence, and in particular their response when asked  about
         the impact that  separation  would  have  on  the  children,  I  am
         satisfied that even a brief separation between  the  appellant  and
         her children would have a  significant  adverse  consequences.  The
         children, aged 3 and  6,  have  never  been  separated  from  their
         mother. As one would naturally expect they have a very strong  bond
         with her. The appellant  became  extremely  distressed  when  asked
         about the impact on her children if she had to return to  Ghana  to
         make an entry clearance application and it took her several minutes
         to compose herself before she was able to continue.  She  indicated
         that she could not even imagine being separated from her  children.
         Her husband indicated that the impact on the  children  of  even  a
         short separation of some weeks  would  be  devastating,  that  they
         would be bewildered and that they would not  understand  why  their
         mother was not with them. This evidence was not challenged and,  in
         the context of the ages of the children, was inherently  plausible.
         In these circumstances I find that the separation of the  appellant
         from her children, even for a temporary period of time, would  have
         a  detrimental  impact  on  them  sufficient  to  cause  them  real
         distress.

     32. In his evidence the appellant's husband stated that  he  needed  to
         work in his office and that his  employer  would  not  be  able  to
         release him from work to enable him to  look  after  his  children.
         This evidence was not challenged and was, in any event,  inherently
         plausible. The appellant's husband indicated  that  his  employment
         frequently required him to travel to other countries for between  a
         week and 10 days at a time. The husband indicated his  belief  that
         nannies or au pairs would not be available to look  after  his  two
         young children for this period of time, and that even if  this  was
         the case the cost would be prohibitive. There was no  challenge  by
         Ms  Fijiwala  to  this  evidence.  I  therefore  accept  that   the
         appellant's husband does frequently travel  abroad  for  relatively
         long periods of time. When he does go abroad it  is  the  appellant
         who looks after the children. I accept the evidence given  by  both
         the appellant and her husband that his parents would be  unable  to
         look after the children as they are themselves elderly, have health
         problems, and have other obligations that are inconsistent with the
         level of child-care they would reasonably be expected  to  provide.
         The appellant's parents-in-law rear pedigree cats in their home and
         would be unable to leave them to  remain,  for  example,  with  the
         children in the appellant's family home. The husband's  step-father
         was recovering from an operation and this was putting a  strain  on
         the appellant's mother-in-law. I accept  the  appellant's  evidence
         that her elderly mother-in-law would have  difficulty  coping  with
         the two young children and tending to her husband.  I  also  accept
         that  requiring  the  appellant's  children  to  live  with   their
         grandparents, some 5  hours  drive  from  the  family  home,  would
         involve removing Mark Joseph, their eldest son,  from  his  school,
         which would have repercussions  both  on  his  education,  and  the
         appellant and her husband's legal responsibility  to  ensure  their
         son attends school. There was no challenge  to  the  oral  evidence
         that there is no-one else who could look after the children or that
         the appellant has no other family in the UK.

     33. I have considered the  possibility  of  the  children  accompanying
         their mother to Ghana for a temporary period of time in  order  for
         her to make her entry clearance  application.  I  note  first  that
         paragraph 117B(6) indicates  that  the  public  interest  does  not
         require a parent's removal where,  inter  alia,  it  would  not  be
         reasonable to expect the British citizen child  to  leave  the  UK.
         This  section  does  not  specify  whether  the  determination   of
         reasonableness depends on whether  the  child  leaves  for  only  a
         temporary period or a permanent period. I find the clear wording of
         the section makes no distinction between a temporary and  permanent
         departure.

     34. Having regard to the particular facts of the appeal, I am,  in  any
         event,  satisfied  that  it  would  not  be  reasonable  for  these
         particular children to leave the UK even for  a  temporary  period.
         Any departure by the children would inevitably separate  them  from
         their father, who would have to remain in the UK as a result of his
         employment.  Such  a  separation,  even  temporarily,  is   clearly
         detrimental to the relationship  between  the  children  and  their
         father, and the possibility of maintaining  communication  remotely
         is a poor substitute, especially for children of their young age. I
         accept Mr. Buley's submission that it is  highly  likely  that  the
         oldest child would have to be taken out of school in order to  join
         his mother, even if efforts were made to make best  use  of  school
         holidays.  This  is  likely  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  his
         education, although I do bear  in  mind  the  early  stage  of  his
         education.

     35. Although the appellant would be returning  to  Ghana  to  make  her
         entry clearance application I have accepted her evidence  that  she
         and her children would have to stay in hotels or  Bed  &  Breakfast
         accommodation for the duration of their stay as her family does not
         have sufficient accommodation to house the appellant  and  her  two
         children. I do not find it reasonable to expect a  woman  with  two
         young children to live in such accommodation for  an  indeterminate
         period of time. This would clearly not be in  the  children's  best
         interests.

     36. I have additionally  considered  the  respondent's  own  policy  in
         respect of a child's best interests under the family rules  and  in
         respect of requiring the parent of a British citizen child to leave
         the UK. The "Immigration Directorate Instruction Family  Migration:
         Appendix FM Section 1.0b Family Life (as a Partner or  Parent)  and
         Private Life: 10-Year Routes, April  2015",  at  paragraph  11.2.3,
         sets out the circumstances in which a British citizen  child  could
         be reasonably  expected  to  leave  the  UK  in  a  non-deportation
         context. The policy reads, in material part:

           'Where a decision to refuse the application would require a
           parent or primary carer to return to a country outside the EU,
           the case must always be assessed on the basis that it would be
           unreasonable to expect a British Citizen child to leave the EU
           with that parent or primary carer.

           In such cases it will usually be appropriate to grant leave to
           the parent or primary carer, to enable them to remain in the UK
           with the child, provided that there is satisfactory evidence of
           a genuine and subsisting parental relationship.

           It may, however, be appropriate to refuse to grant leave where
           the conduct of the parent or primary carer gives rise to
           considerations of such weight as to justify separation, if the
           child could otherwise stay with another parent or alternative
           primary carer in the UK or in the EU.

           The circumstances envisaged could cover amongst others:

         . criminality falling below the thresholds set out in paragraph
           398 of the Immigration Rules;

         . a very poor immigration history, such as where the person has
           repeatedly and deliberately breached the Immigration Rules.

           In considering whether refusal may be appropriate the decision
           maker must consider the impact on the child of any separation.'

     37. The appellant  has  not  engaged  in  any  criminality.  Nor  am  I
         satisfied that she has 'a very poor immigration  history'.  I  have
         found as a fact that she had not breached  any  of  the  conditions
         attached to her leave to enter the UK as a visitor,  and  that  she
         has not broken any of the requirements of the immigration rules.  I
         have specifically found  that  she  has  not  used  deception  when
         entering the UK or made an abusive application. I find  the  policy
         expresses the respondent's  view  of  the  best  interests  of  the
         children and the relevant weight to attach to the  public  interest
         considerations. The policy indicates, in the view of the  Secretary
         of State, where the public interest lies in circumstances where, in
         order to remain as a family unit, a parent, such as the  appellant,
         of a British citizen child is  required  to  return  to  their  own
         country.  In relation to the factual matrix of the  present  appeal
         the  policy  tends  towards  a  conclusion  that   there   are   no
         considerations of such weight as to justify separation between  the
         appellant and her children.

     38. In assessing the existence of compelling  circumstances  sufficient
         to  render  the  appellant's  removal   disproportionate   I   have
         additionally consider the factors identified in section 117B of the
         2002 Act.  I  accord  significant  weight  to  the  fact  that  the
         maintenance of effective  immigration  control  is  in  the  public
         interest. Effective  immigration  control  in  the  present  appeal
         includes the prevention of abusive applications by those posing  as
         visitors. I take account of the decision  in  AM  (S  117B)  Malawi
         [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC) to the effect that the appellant can  obtain
         no positive right to a grant of leave to remain from  either  s117B
         (2) or (3), whatever the degree of her fluency in English,  or  the
         strength of her financial resources. I further  take  into  account
         the fact that the appellant  has  not  met  the  formal  evidential
         requirements  contained  in  Appendix  FM-SE  in  respect  of   her
         husband's employment and income (although there were 6 months worth
         of bank account statements from September 2014  to  February  2014,
         and a letter from his employer setting out his employment  details,
         the appellant's bundle  only  contained  3  months  worth  of  wage
         slips). There has never been any challenge to the  husband's  claim
         that his gross annual salary was �68,000, and is  now  higher.  The
         bank account statements and wage slips support this  assertion,  as
         do his employer's letters. The husband  confirmed  at  the  hearing
         that he continues to be in the same employment and that he  has  in
         fact received an increase in his wages. I have found the husband to
         be a credible witness. When the husband offered to provide  further
         evidence of his wage slips and bank account details Ms Fijiwala did
         not challenge this evidence. I am satisfied, having considered  the
         evidence before me 'in the round',  that  the  appellant's  husband
         does earn over �68,000 gross per annum. This is relevant in respect
         of the section 117B(3) consideration  as,  although  the  appellant
         gains no positive right to a grant of leave to remain, it is not  a
         matter that can be held against her. Mr Fijiwala  accepted  at  the
         hearing that the appellant had obtained an Entry Level  Certificate
         in ESOL International from Trinity  College  London  and  indicated
         that this met the language requirements of Appendix FM.

     39. With respect  to  section  117B(4)  I  note  that  the  appellant's
         relationship with her husband was not established when she  was  in
         the UK unlawfully, and I further note that she has  never  been  in
         the UK unlawfully. Section 117B(5)  indicates  that  little  weight
         should be given to a private life established by a person at a time
         when the person's immigration status is precarious. The appellant's
         immigration status when in the UK has always been  precarious,  but
         she is not relying on her private life to resist  the  decision  to
         remove her but upon her family life relationship with her  children
         and her husband, relationships which were established when none  of
         them were in the United Kingdom.

     40. In relation to section 117B(6) Mr Buley submits  that  the  section
         overrides the provisions of the immigration rules. I do not  accept
         that submission. I accept the respondent's written submission  that
         section  117B(6)  is  not  a  trump  card  overriding   all   other
         considerations. It is one of a number of considerations  that  must
         be  considered   in   the   overall   proportionality   assessment.
         Approaching section  117B(6)  on  this  basis,  I  am  nevertheless
         satisfied, for the reasons I have already given, that it would  not
         be reasonable to expect  the  appellant's  children  to  leave  the
         United Kingdom.

     41. I have given very careful consideration  to  the  totality  of  the
         evidence  before  me.  I  find  this  is  a  rare  case  where  the
         appellant's removal, even for a temporary period,  would,  for  the
         exceptional and compelling reasons I have already given, amount  to
         a disproportionate interference with Article 8.

Decision:

The appeal is allowed
