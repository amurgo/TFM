Representation:
Appellant   Miss Kullar (Legal Representative)
Respondent  Mr Richards (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are  Turkish  nationals.  The  second  and  third  named
    appellants are children of the first-named appellant and  the  sponsor,
    [Halil E]. On October 1, 2013 they applied for leave to enter as family
    members of a Turkish national established in business.  The  respondent
    refused their applications on October 30, 2013 on the  basis  they  did
    not meet the requirements of HC 509.

 2. The appellants appealed against those decisions under section 82(1)  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on November 18, 2013

 3. The matter was heard by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Mather  on
    September 23, 2014 and in a decision promulgated on October 7, 2014 the
    Tribunal refused their  applications.  The  Judge  found  that  as  the
    sponsor has been naturalised as a British citizen on  August  22,  2013
    the appellants could not longer seek entry clearance under HC 509.  She
    dismissed their appeals on that basis.

 4. The appellants applied for permission to appeal  on  October  30,  2014
    submitting the Tribunal had erred by her approach. Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Grant-Hutchinson refused permission  and  permission  was
    renewed to the Upper Tribunal on January 7, 2015. Upper Tribunal  Judge
    McGeachy found there was an arguable error in  law  on  the  basis  the
    sponsor was a dual British/Turkish national.

 5. The matter came before me on the above date and I  discussed  with  the
    representatives why permission had been given. Miss Kullar referred  me
    to the decision of ZN (Afghanistan) FC and others (Appellants) c  Entry
    Clearance Offcier (Karachi) (Respondent) and one  other  action  [2010]
    UKSC 21 but I referred both representatives to  the  European  case  of
    Staatssecretaris van Justitie v Kahveci and Inan Cases  C-7/10  and  C-
    9/10 CJEU First Chamber.

 6. I stood the matter down for the representatives to review the case  law
    and on their  return  Mr  Richards  accepted  that  the  European  case
    appeared to address the issue and I was referred  to  paragraphs  52-55
    and 82 of that decision.  The  Court  made  clear  that  Article  7  of
    Decision No 1/80 must be interpreted as meaning that a family member of
    a Turkish worker duly registered as belonging to the labour force of  a
    member state could still invoke that  provision  once  the  worker  had
    acquired the nationality  of  the  member  state  while  retaining  his
    Turkish nationality.

 7. It follows that Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Mather's approach  was
    erroneous. She accepted that the sponsor and first-named appellant were
    in a genuine relationship and there was clear evidence on the file that
    the sponsor was working as required and able to support and accommodate
    the appellants.

 8. I therefore find there was an error in law and I allow the  appellants'
    appeals and  set  aside  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Mather's
    decision.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction and  I  see
    no reason to make an order at this stage.

    DECISION

10. There was an error in law and I set aside the decision. I  have  remade
    the decision and allow the appeal under HC 509.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have allowed the appeals but do not make a fee award because the  relevant
financial evidence was produced after the refusal letter.
