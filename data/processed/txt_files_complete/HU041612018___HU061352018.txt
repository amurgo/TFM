Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr R Sharma of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                 REASONS FOR FINDING A MATERIAL ERROR OF LAW

The Appellants

 1. The Appellants are both citizens of India  and  are  husband  and  wife
    respectively. They appealed against a decision of the Respondent  dated
    24 January 2018 to refuse to grant them leave to remain in  the  United
    Kingdom. Their appeals were allowed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
    Adio sitting at Hatton Cross on 13 September 2018. The  Respondent  was
    granted permission to appeal that decision and the matter  came  before
    me to determine whether there was  a  material  error  of  law  in  the
    determination such that it fell to be set aside, and  directions  given
    for the rehearing of the appeal. For the reasons which  I  set  out  in
    more detail below, I find that there were material errors of law in the
    First-tier Tribunal's determination and I have directed that the appeal
    be remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal to be reheard.

 2. The first Appellant (who I shall refer to as "the  Appellant")  entered
    the United Kingdom on 10  February  2006  with  entry  clearance  as  a
    student which was subsequently extended. He was granted  further  leave
    to remain until 18 August 2011 as a Tier 1 (Post-study)  Migrant.  This
    was  extended  until  15th  of  July  2016.  He  subsequently  made  an
    application for indefinite leave to remain the  refusal  of  which  has
    given  rise  to  these  proceedings.  The  2nd  Appellant's  appeal  is
    dependent on the appeal of her husband.

The Explanation for Refusal

 3. The application for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  was  refused  under
    paragraph 322 (5) of the Immigration Rules which states that  leave  to
    remain should normally be refused  because  of  the  undesirability  of
    permitting a person to remain in the United Kingdom  in  the  light  of
    their conduct.

 4. When the Appellant applied for leave in 2011  he  claimed  to  have  an
    income of �35,929.56p for the  period  2010/2011.  He  was  awarded  20
    points under the "previous  earnings"  category  for  earnings  between
    �35,000 and �40,000. In May 2016 the Appellant declared to HMRC a total
    income received of �21,386 for  that  same  period  2010/2011.  Had  he
    declared this to the Respondent he would have received zero points  for
    previous earnings as they were under �25,000.  The  Appellant  on  that
    same declaration then amended the figures declared to HMRC so they  now
    matched the figure declared to the Respondent.  The Respondent  pointed
    to a similar pattern of inconsistent declarations for subsequent years.
    The Respondent did not accept that the failure to declare  the  correct
    earnings to HMRC was a genuine error. In the light of this conduct  the
    application for indefinite leave to remain was refused.

The Decision at First Instance

 5. The Judge correctly directed himself that as the  case  had  raised  an
    issue of deception the initial burden was on the Respondent but as that
    was discharged (because of the discrepancy  in  the  tax  figures)  the
    Appellant was obliged to provide an  innocent  explanation.  The  Judge
    accepted the Appellant's explanation, that he had not  been  dishonest,
    because HMRC had not taken any  further  punitive  action  against  the
    Appellant  indicating  that  the  Appellant  was  not  making  a  false
    representation or deception. The Appellant had not been prompted before
    dealing with the issue of the under declarations. I  assume  that  what
    the Judge meant by that was that the Appellant had not been prompted by
    the Respondent. The Appellant does seem to have received a letter  from
    HMRC on 17 November 2015 which prompted him to act.

 6. The Judge noted that the  Appellant  had  tried  to  make  a  complaint
    against his previous accountants but  to  no  avail.  The  Respondent's
    decision was declared to be disproportionate because the Appellant  had
    not falsely declared his income or self-employed earnings  to  HMRC  in
    2010/2011 and 2012/2013. There had been a  genuine  error  due  to  the
    actions of his accountants and because of the Appellant's own  lack  of
    knowledge of tax affairs.  He  had  wrongly  repeated  the  mistake  in
    2012/2013. The appeal was allowed.

The Onward Appeal

 7. The Respondent's onward appeal argued that it  was  not  relevant  that
    HMRC had  not  taken  further  action  against  the  Appellant  as  the
    interests  of  HMRC  and  the  Respondent  were  quite  different.  The
    Appellant  was  responsible  for  his  own   tax   affairs   and   this
    responsibility could not be passed on to his accountant. The  Appellant
    was responsible for signing off each year's tax return thereby that  he
    had consented to each return. If there was an  inaccuracy  it  was  the
    Appellant's responsibility. The Appellant had benefited from not paying
    the correct tax on time as he did not correct his liability until  five
    years later. Paragraph 322 (5) was engaged.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Hollingworth on 7 December 2018 who noted that it was arguable that the
    Judge had attached undue weight to the fact that HMRC had not taken any
    further action against the Appellant. It was unclear to what extent the
    weight attached to that point had affected the  outcome.  Arguably  the
    Judge should have set out a fuller analysis of the relationship between
    the nature of the error  found  to  be  genuine  on  the  part  of  the
    Appellant, the criteria for the  payment  of  tax  in  the  context  in
    question and the figures relating to that context.  A  fuller  analysis
    was required of  the  degree  of  understanding  of  the  Appellant  in
    relation to the basis proceeded upon by his  previous  accountants  for
    the completion of the tax return in question.

 9. The Appellant responded to the grant of permission by filing a response
    under rule 24 which argued that the determination was legally sound and
    sustainable. The grounds of appeal were essentially a disagreement with
    the decision. HMRC  were  statutorily  bound  to  consider  imposing  a
    penalty. The fact that they had chosen  not  to  issue  a  penalty  was
    therefore relevant. The rule 24 response sought to argue that the  case
    of Abbasi JR/13807/2016 was wrongly decided. The Appellant's  behaviour
    was not deliberate and there was no attempt to conceal the error of the
    accountants. It was open to the Appellant  to  lay  the  blame  on  his
    accountant.

The Hearing Before Me

10. At the hearing before me the Presenting Officer argued that there might
    be operational reasons why HMRC did  not  investigate  the  Appellant's
    conduct further than they had. It was very expensive to pursue a proper
    investigation. It was far easier for them  to  accept  the  Appellant's
    error and take the back payment.

11. It was not clear what the Judgement by "not prompted" (see paragraph  5
    above). The complaint made against the accountants was made very  late.
    There was nothing to show that it led anywhere. Reliance was placed  on
    the Upper Tribunal decision of Khan [2018] UKUT 384 (also cited in  the
    rule 24 response). That case offered guidance to  the  approach  to  be
    adopted in these cases. Accountants  did  send  tax  returns  to  their
    clients for approval before being lodged with HMRC. It was baffling how
    the Appellant could miss such a  substantial  discrepancy  as  in  this
    case.

12. In reply, counsel relied on the rule 24 response.  Where  there  was  a
    deliberate misstatement by a taxpayer a  penalty  had  to  follow.  The
    Appellant had been approached in  2015  in  relation  to  his  employed
    income which led to another accountant finding the previous errors.  It
    was not necessarily the case that every client  of  an  accountant  was
    expected to sign  the  tax  return.  It  was  not  sufficient  for  the
    Respondent to make a complaint against the Appellant that  he  was  not
    careful enough in his tax dealings, there had to be evidence of a  more
    deliberate action and that had not been made out. If a  material  error
    of law was found the case should be remitted back  to  the  First-tier.
    The Presenting Officer agreed with remittal.

Findings

13. The operative paragraph in this  case,  322  (5),  is  a  discretionary
    ground for refusal not a mandatory one. In a  case  such  as  this  the
    essential  question  is  whether  the  Respondent  can  establish  with
    sufficient cogency of evidence that the Appellant has been dishonest in
    his dealings either with the Respondent or with HMRC or both.  Guidance
    as to the correct approach in assessing the question of the Appellant's
    honesty was provided by Mr Justice Spencer in the  case  of  Khan.  The
    head note to that case reads:

         "(i) Where there has been  a  significant  difference  between  the
             income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain
             and the income declared to HMRC, the  Secretary  of  State  is
             entitled to draw an inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been
             deceitful or dishonest and therefore he should be refused  ILR
             within paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules.   Such  an
             inference could  be  expected  where  there  is  no  plausible
             explanation for the discrepancy.

         (ii) Where an  Applicant  has  presented  evidence  to  show  that,
             despite  the  prima  facie  inference,  he  was  not  in  fact
             dishonest but only careless, then the Secretary of State  must
             decide whether the explanation and evidence is sufficient,  in
             her  view,  to  displace  the   prima   facie   inference   of
             deceit/dishonesty.

         (iii)    In approaching that fact-finding task,  the  Secretary  of
             State should remind herself that,  although  the  standard  of
             proof is the "balance of probability", a finding that a person
             has been deceitful  and  dishonest  in  relation  to  his  tax
             affairs with the consequence that he is denied  settlement  in
             this  country  is  a  very  serious   finding   with   serious
             consequences.

         (iv) For an Applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for  an
             "error" in relation to the historical tax return will  not  be
             the end of the matter,  given  that  the  accountant  will  or
             should have asked the tax payer to confirm that the return was
             accurate and to have signed the tax  return.  Furthermore  the
             Applicant will have known of his or her earnings and will have
             expected to pay tax thereon.  If the Applicant does  not  take
             steps within a reasonable time to remedy  the  situation,  the
             Secretary of State may  be  entitled  to  conclude  that  this
             failure justifies a conclusion that there has been  deceit  or
             dishonesty.

         (v)  When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest  or
             merely careless the Secretary of  State  should  consider  the
             following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to  which
             they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):

             i.   Whether the explanation for the error by  the  accountant
                  is plausible;

             ii.  Whether the documentation which can be assumed  to  exist
                  (for example, correspondence between the Applicant and his
                  accountant at  the  time  of  the  tax  return)  has  been
                  disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for  why  it
                  is missing;

             iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had  been
                  made because his liability to pay tax  was  less  than  he
                  should have expected;

             iv.  Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken  steps  to
                  remedy the situation and, if so,  when  those  steps  were
                  taken and the explanation for any significant delay."

14. For the Respondent to be able to establish a material error  or  errors
    of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal the  Respondent  must
    show that the First-tier Tribunal did not assess the question before it
    of the Appellant's dishonesty  in  a  sufficiently  reasoned  way.  The
    discrepancy in the figures of itself raised  a  suspicion  because  the
    difference in amounts declared to the respective government departments
    was so substantial. The question then was whether there was a plausible
    explanation for the discrepancy in the figures.

15. The Judge appears to have placed a great  deal  of  weight  in  finding
    plausibility in the absence of punitive proceedings taken by  HMRC.  It
    was in my view a material error of law  for  the  Judge  to  place  the
    weight that he did on that  aspect  of  the  case  in  the  absence  of
    evidence of the practice of HMRC. There may indeed be an obligation  on
    HMRC to take steps to recover tax due but that is far from saying  that
    there is an obligation to prosecute in all cases where income  has  not
    been correctly declared. As the  Respondent  submitted,  there  may  be
    sound  operational  reasons  why  HMRC  would  wish  to  husband  their
    resources and concentrate  on  some  aspects  of  tax  evasion  to  the
    exclusion of other defaults. The  reason  why  the  Judge  placed  such
    weight on  the  absence  of  punitive  proceedings  is  not  adequately
    reasoned and amounts to an error of law.

16. The  2nd  reason  why  the  Judge  found  the  Appellant's  explanation
    plausible was because the Appellant put  the  blame  for  the  problems
    which had arisen on his accountants. This aspect is considered in  Khan
    which  expresses  a  degree  of  scepticism  about  attempts  to  blame
    accountants by pointing out: (a) that the taxpayer will have authorised
    the tax return submitted and (b) that the Appellant would be  taken  to
    know what his income was, in this case especially so given that he  was
    both employed and self-employed. I do not consider that either of these
    issues was adequately addressed in the determination of the  First-tier
    Tribunal. How a complaint  made  very  late  in  the  day  against  the
    accountants was sufficient to deal with the  two  points  (a)  and  (b)
    above, raised in Khan was again inadequately addressed.

17. I consider that there  were  such  material  errors  of  law  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be set aside. The next issue
    is what arrangements should be made for the rehearing  of  the  appeal.
    Both parties indicated that if I found a material  error  of  law  they
    would ask the Upper Tribunal to remit the case back  to  a  differently
    constituted First-tier Tribunal for rehearing. In deciding  whether  to
    remit, I bear in mind the Senior President's Practice Direction.  I  do
    not consider that this is a case where  the  facts  have  largely  been
    established. The discrepancy in the figures appears to  be  agreed  but
    the key issues were the Appellant's motivation and responsibility. This
    is more properly decided by the First-tier Tribunal.

18. An issue to be determined will be whether the Appellant  was  aware  of
    the contents of the tax return being submitted on his behalf and if  he
    was not why not. The Appellant should file  and  serve  a  supplemental
    statement at least 14 days before the remitted hearing indicating  more
    clearly what he did or did not know about the tax returns submitted  on
    his behalf. That goes to the issue of his honesty or dishonesty and  is
    not a proper matter to be dealt with by the Upper Tribunal acting as  a
    primary decision maker. The matter should be remitted back to the First-
    tier Tribunal for a proper consideration of the Appellant's honesty  in
    the light of the guidance put forward by the Upper Tribunal.

19. The points made by Judge Hollingworth in granting permission to  appeal
    are also relevant (see paragraph 8 above) and they should be  addressed
    by the parties at the re-hearing. Khan was a judicial  review  decision
    but considerable weight  is  to  be  attached  to  it  because  of  the
    seniority of the Tribunal and the relevance of the issues  it  decides.
    The appeal will be remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal  at  Hatton
    Cross to be heard by any Judge  other  than  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Adio.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside. I direct that  the  rehearing  of  this  appeal
should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard de novo.

The Respondent's appeal is allowed to that limited extent.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.
