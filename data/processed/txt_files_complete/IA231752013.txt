For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Background

   1. The appellant is a citizen of the Russian Federation who was  born  on
      20 July 1977.  On 1 March 2006, he married an Estonian national, Raili
      Raimet at the register office in Tallin in Estonia.   He  applied  for
      and was granted a family permit to enter the UK as the  spouse  of  an
      EEA national. The appellant entered the  United  Kingdom  on  8  March
      2006.  On 8 September 2006, he applied  for  a  residence  card  as  a
      family member of an  EEA  national  under  the  Immigration  (European
      Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  (SI  2006/1003)  (the  "2006   EEA
      Regulations").  Thereafter, on 20 April 2007, he  was  issued  with  a
      residence card on that basis valid until 20 April 2012.

   2. The appellant's relationship with his wife deteriorated and  his  wife
      petitioned for divorce in Estonia. On 6 July 2011, the  appellant  and
      his wife were divorced by judicial decree issued by the  Harju  County
      Court in Estonia.

   3. On 20 April 2012, the appellant's legal representatives applied on his
      behalf for a residence card confirming that he had a  permanent  right
      of residence under reg 15 of the 2006 EEA Regulations.  The basis  for
      that application was that the appellant  had  resided  in  the  UK  in
      accordance with the EEA Regulations for a period of  5  years  from  8
      March 2006 when he entered the United Kingdom with a family permit  as
      the family member of an  EEA  national.   The  application  also  made
      reference to the appellant's reliance upon his having retained a right
      of residence under reg 10 of the 2006 EEA  Regulations  following  his
      divorce on 6 July 2011.

   4. On 24 June 2013, the respondent refused the appellant's application on
      a number of bases.  First, the respondent was not satisfied  that  the
      appellant's overseas divorce was valid by virtue  of  s.46(2)  of  the
      Family Law Act 1986 as it could not be shown that both parties to  the
      marriage were not "habitually  resident"  in  the  UK  throughout  the
      period  of  one  year  immediately  preceding  the  date  of  divorce.
      Secondly, on the basis of  the  documentary  evidence  submitted,  the
      respondent was not  satisfied  that  the  appellant's  wife  had  been
      exercising Treaty rights, namely as a self employed person up  to  the
      date of divorce on 6 July 2011.

The First-tier Tribunal's Decision

   5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.   The  appeal  was
      determined by Judge Kempton without a hearing in a determination dated
      17 November 2013.  Judge Kempton dismissed the appellant's appeal both
      under the 2006 EEA Regulations and also in reliance upon  para  276ADE
      of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended)  and  Article  8  of  the
      ECHR.  Having set out at  some  length  extracts  from  the  2006  EEA
      Regulations, Judge Kempton's reasons are set out  at  para  9  of  her
      determination as follows:

           "There is no evidence before me that the divorce in Estonia  was
           a valid divorce in terms of the law applicable to  marriage  and
           divorce in that country.  Accordingly, I cannot accept that  the
           divorce was valid.  The appellant's  representatives  said  that
           they would provide such evidence  but  have  failed  to  do  so.
           There is no additional evidence before me to show the  sponsor's
           financial circumstances allow her to meet the regulations,  even
           if the divorce had been valid.  The appeal fails.  The appellant
           has not specified how he would be affected by Article 8 of ECHR,
           and accordingly, I am not in a position to consider any argument
           in relation to Article 8."

   6. On 6 December 2013, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Blandy) granted the
      appellant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  He  did  so  on
      the following grounds:

           "2.   The grounds of the application argue at some  considerable
                 length that the  Judge  did  not  adequately  consider  the
                 question of  the  validity  of  the  Estonian  divorce  and
                 wrongly found that it  was  not  valid.   It  is  generally
                 argued that the Judge failed to address the law relating to
                 an application for confirmation of permanent residence.   I
                 do find the grounds to be arguable.  I  consider  that  the
                 reasons  for  the  decision   in   paragraph   9   of   the
                 determination arguably do not adequately address the issues
                 either in relation to the validity of  the  divorce  or  in
                 relation to  the  application  generally,  It  is  arguably
                 impossible to ascertain the reasoning behind  the  findings
                 of the Judge.  I find all grounds to be arguable."

   7. Thus, the appeal came before us.

Error of Law

   8. The appellant was not  legally  represented  and  the  respondent  was
      represented by Mr Richards.

   9. Mr Richards accepted that both the Secretary of State  and  the  Judge
      were wrong to conclude that the appellant's divorce was not valid  and
      recognised in the UK.  That is patently  correct.   The  Secretary  of
      State (and by adoption the Judge) applied the wrong provision  in  the
      Family Law Act 1986.  As the respondent's refusal letter makes  clear,
      s.46(2) of that Act, which was specifically relied upon to reject  the
      application, only applies to overseas divorces "obtained other than by
      means of  proceedings".   The  appellant's  divorce  was  obtained  by
      judicial proceedings in Estonia and so s.46(2) - and  the  requirement
      that neither party be habitually resident in the UK during the  period
      of one year before the date of divorce - was simply inapplicable.   Mr
      Richards accepted that as the  appellant's  divorce  was  obtained  by
      judicial proceedings it is recognised in the UK.  There is  no  doubt,
      therefore, the First-tier Tribunal's decision involved the  making  of
      an error of law.  Nevertheless, Mr Richards submitted that  the  error
      by the Judge was not  material  as  there  was  insufficient  evidence
      before the Judge to find that the appellant's ex-wife had  been  self-
      employed during the relevant period relied upon.

  10. Before we turn to deal with the evidence, it is clear to us that there
      was a procedural error in the First-tier Tribunal's  proceedings.   In
      reaching her adverse findings on the evidence, it is clear that  Judge
      Kempton did not have before her a bundle of documents which were  sent
      to the Tribunal under cover of a letter  dated  8  November  2013  and
      which is stamped as received on 12 November 2013.  It  is  also  clear
      from correspondence between the appellant's then legal representatives
      and the First-tier Tribunal that the Tribunal was informed that  these
      documents were to be sent to the Tribunal albeit outside the date  set
      out in the Tribunal's notice for submission of written evidence by  16
      October 2013.  At the date that Judge Kempton determined  this  appeal
      on 17 November 2013, the  Tribunal  had  in  its  possession  evidence
      relevant to the appellant's appeal which  had  been  received  5  days
      earlier.  It does not seem that this evidence was  passed  on  to  the
      Judge prior to her making the decision.  That was a  procedural  error
      which, through no fault of the Judge, means that her  decision  cannot
      stand.

  11. That said, we turn to the substance of the appellant's claim under the
      2006 EEA Regulations.

The 2006 EEA Regulations

  12. We begin with the relevant provisions of the 2006 EEA Regulations.

  13. Regulation 15 sets out the circumstances under which a person acquires
      a right of permanent residence in the UK.  Regulation 15(1)(b) and (f)
      deal, so far as relevant, with the position  of  a  family  member  as
      follows:

           "15.(1)     The following persons shall  acquire  the  right  to
                 reside in the United Kingdom permanently -

                 ....

                 (b)   a family member of an EEA national who is not himself
                       an EEA national but who has  resided  in  the  United
                       Kingdom with the  EEA  national  in  accordance  with
                       these Regulations for a  continuous  period  of  five
                       years;

                 ....

                 (f)         a person who -

                      i) has resided in the United  Kingdom  in  accordance
                         with these Regulations for a continuous period  of
                         five years; and

                     ii) was, at the end of that period,  a  family  member
                         who has retained the right of residence."

  14. The reference in reg 15(1)(f) to a person who has "retained the  right
      of residence" is a reference back to reg  10  which,  in  relation  to
      those who have been divorced, provides as follows:

           "10(1)       In  these  Regulations,  'family  member  who   has
                 retained  the  right  of  residence'  means,   subject   to
                 paragraph (8), a person who  satisfies  the  conditions  in
                 paragraph (2), (3), (4) and (5).

            .....

           (5)   A person satisfies the conditions in this paragraph if -

                    a) he ceased to be a family member of a qualified person
                       or of an EEA  national  with  a  permanent  right  of
                       residence on the termination of the marriage or civil
                       partnership of that person;

                    b) he was residing in the United Kingdom  in  accordance
                       with  these  Regulations   at   the   date   of   the
                       termination;

                    c) he satisfies the condition in paragraph (6); and

                    d) either -

                      i) prior to the initiation of the proceedings for the
                         termination  of  the   marriage   or   the   civil
                         partnership the marriage or civil partnership  had
                         lasted for at least three years and the parties to
                         the marriage or civil partnership had  resided  in
                         the United Kingdom for at least  one  year  during
                         its duration; ....

           6) The condition in this paragraph is that the person -

                    a) is not an EEA national but would, if he were  an  EEA
                       national, be a worker, a self-employed  person  or  a
                       self-sufficient person under regulation 6; or

                    b) is the family member of a  person  who  falls  within
                       paragraph (a)."

  15. In her decision, the Secretary of State focussed upon the validity  of
      the appellant's divorce and whether, therefore, he could have retained
      a right of residence under reg 10.  In fact, the appellant's claim did
      not necessarily rely at all upon reg 10.  The appellant came to the UK
      on 8 March 2006 with a family permit as a family member of  his  wife.
      He was granted a residence card on that basis on 20 April  2007  valid
      until 20 April 2012.  In fact, the  appellant's  claim  was  therefore
      that between 8 March 2006 and 7 March 2011 (a 5 year  period)  he  was
      residing in the UK in accordance  with  the  EEA  Regulations  as  the
      family member of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights.   (see  reg
      15(1)(b) set out above).  In other words, prior  to  his  divorce  the
      appellant's claim was that he had already acquired a  permanent  right
      of residence and that right of residence was simply not  lost  by  the
      fact of his divorce on 6 July 2011.  As reg 15(2) makes clear:

           "15  (2)      The  right  of  permanent  residence  under   this
                 regulation shall be lost  only  through  absence  from  the
                 United Kingdom  for  a  period  exceeding  two  consecutive
                 years." (our emphasis).

  16. It was only  as  an  alternative  basis  that  the  appellant's  legal
      representatives asserted  that  the  appellant  retained  a  right  of
      residence under reg 10 at the date of his divorce if, but only if,  he
      could not establish that prior to that date he had lived in the UK for
      a continuous period of five years as  the  family  member  of  an  EEA
      national exercising Treaty rights.  His principal case was, of course,
      that since his arrival his wife had been exercising Treaty rights  and
      therefore he had been lawfully residing in the UK initially by  virtue
      of reg 13(2) for a period of 3 months and thereafter by virtue of  reg
      14(2) which states that:

           "14(2)      A family member of a qualified  person  residing  in
                 the United Kingdom under  paragraph  (1)...is  entitled  to
                 reside in the United Kingdom for as long as he remains  the
                 family member of a qualified person or EEA national."

  17. Both the family permit and residence card valid until  20  April  2012
      evidenced that the appellant was indeed residing  in  accordance  with
      the Regulations.

  18. Consequently, in our judgment,  the  reliance  upon  reg  10  and  any
      claimed retained right of residence is potentially irrelevant to  this
      appeal.  The principal issue is whether the evidence establishes  that
      between 8 March 2006 and 7 March 2011 the appellant, was  residing  in
      the UK as the family member (spouse) of his wife  who  was  exercising
      Treaty rights, namely as a self-employed person as both he,  and  she,
      claim.

Discussion

  19. We turn, therefore, to that issue which involves an assessment of  the
      evidence.  In doing so, we remind ourselves that the burden  of  proof
      is upon the appellant to establish on a balance of probabilities  that
      he meets the requirements of the EEA Regulations.

  20. Has the appellant established on the  documentary  evidence  that  his
      (now) ex-wife was self-employed between 8 March 2006 and 7 March 2011?

  21. First, there is the witness statement of the appellant's ex-wife dated
      28 October 2013 (at pages 51-52 of the bundle) in which she states:

           "I have been and continue to be a self-employed  person  in  the
           UK.  My tax affairs are up-to-date.  I pay my  taxes.   You  can
           check my HMRC details.  Some of the documents I already provided
           to my ex-husband, the appellant.  I refuse to provide  my  other
           documents as I believe that this information is  private.  I  do
           not wish for my ex-husband to see my bank statements.  I believe
           that I am entitled to some privacy about our divorce.  I however
           authorise the Court or the Home Office to  do  their  checks  as
           required to confirm my self-employment in the UK."

  22. In addition, the appellant's statement dated 8 October 2013 (at  pages
      177-181 of the bundle) states as follows at paras 16-21 as follows:

           "16.  With regard to my ex-wife's self  employment,  I  wish  to
                 confirm that she has been self  employment  all  the  time.
                 The Respondent confirms that we provided documents such  as
                 HMRC Tax  Returns,  Self  Assessments,  invoices,  National
                 Insurance   Contributions   bills,   Working   Tax   Credit
                 documents,  HMRC  tax  calculation  which  confirm  my  ex-
                 spouse's  self  employment  from  2006  until  2012.    She
                 currently continues to be self employed as confirmed by up-
                 to-date tax documents and her  witness  Statement  together
                 with a copy of the ID which is certified  by  a  solicitor.
                 Furthermore, she provides her authority to the Court or the
                 Respondent  to  contact  the  HMRC  to  confirm  her   self
                 employment.

             17. She  refused  to  give  me  her  bank  statements  and  she
                 explained this in her witness statement.

             18.  The Respondent stated that she had gaps  in  her  national
                 insurance contributions bills.  This is  incorrect  as  the
                 different is adding  up  to  the  next  National  Insurance
                 contributions bill when it is not paid.  The last bills for
                 July 2011 - the period in question - as we  divorced  then,
                 clearly confirms that my ex-spouse has been a self employed
                 person.   Her  invoices,  receipts,   Tax   Returns,   Self
                 Assessments, paid National  Insurance  contributions  bills
                 are confirmation of this.

             19.  The  Respondent  sated  that  HMRC   recommends   National
                 Insurance contribution bills to be paid by direct debit.  I
                 believe that this is a recommendation only and the  payment
                 can be made  in  any  way  the  individual  want.   I  have
                 provided NI contributions bill for 200,  2007,  2008,  2009
                 and  two  for  2011.   The  bill  for  2011  includes  2010
                 liabilities.  Therefore it is clear that all the  NI  bills
                 have been paid.

             20. HMRC only recommends to pay NI  by  direct  debit  and  use
                 business bank  account  but  is  individual  preference  as
                 confirmed but in letter form  the  HMRC  addressed  to  the
                 accountant that was instructed by  my  solicitors  at  page
                 176.

             21. Every invoice provided could be corroborated.  The  details
                 on the invoice itself.  My details also have been  provided
                 but I have not been contacted."

  23. It is for the appellant to establish on the evidence that he meets the
      requirements of the 2006 EEA Regulations and there  is  no  obligation
      upon  the  respondent  to  trawl  for  relevant  documents  in   other
      government departments (see Amos v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 552).

  24. Turning to those documents, they are set out in the appellant's appeal
      bundle.  At pages 77-85 there are a number of invoices between  8  May
      2006 and 5 February 2013 which it  is  claimed  established  that  the
      appellant's ex-wife was engaged in self employment as a babysitter and
      housekeeper.  In addition, at pages 89-92, there are a number of  HMRC
      documents relating to, inter alia, working tax  credits  paid  to  the
      appellant's ex-wife between 24 April 2007 and 5 April 2008.  At  pages
      53-60 there are a number of documents  again  from  HMRC  relating  to
      national insurance contribution payments covering periods between July
      2006 and January 2009 and then again in 2011 and 2012.  There  are  no
      such documents relating  to  2010.   At  pages  69-76  there  are  tax
      returns, although we apprehend not all the returns which  were  placed
      before the Secretary of State which are referred to  in  her  decision
      letter relating to the tax years 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.

  25. In her decision letter, the Secretary of State  declined  to  find  as
      reliable the evidence concerning the tax, national insurance  and  tax
      credit  documents  without  supporting  documentation  such  as   bank
      statements, audited accounts etc.  The Secretary of State also doubted
      their reliability on the basis that the sponsor's income  appeared  to
      be not above the threshold for personal allowance and her expenses for
      self employment were correspondingly small.

  26. It has never been suggested  that  the  appellant's  ex-wife  was  the
      principal or even equal breadwinner in their family. It is clear  from
      the documentation submitted in relation to the appellant's  employment
      in the form of P60 certificates from 2007 until he was made  redundant
      on 10 May 2013 that he was employed earning an income  initially  just
      below �20,000 per annum and latterly between �22,000 and  �25,000  per
      annum.

  27. There is no requirement under EU law in order  to  establish  that  an
      individual's employment or self employment is an  exercise  of  Treaty
      rights that their income should be substantial but merely that it is a
      genuine employment or business activity, so that  the  individual  can
      properly be described as a 'worker'.

  28. We must assess the documentary evidence but must do so in the light of
      a number of features in this appeal which we consider to be important.
       First, there is the evidence of both the appellant  and  his  ex-wife
      that she was self employed at the relevant time.  It  has  never  been
      suggested that the appellant is other than a truthful individual.  The
      documentation concerning his  employment  is  supportive  of  his  own
      evidence on that issue and nothing we have seen casts any  doubt  upon
      any other aspect of his evidence. Secondly, the appellant came to  the
      UK on a family permit as a  family  member  of  an  EEA  national  and
      thereafter was granted a residence card in  April  2007  on  the  same
      basis.   Clearly at that time, the respondent was satisfied  that  his
      ex-wife was exercising Treaty rights. Although  it  is  no  more  than
      evidence that his residence in the UK was lawful, it remains the  fact
      that his residence card was valid until April 2012 and at no point has
      the respondent sought to revoke that on  the  basis  that  he  was  no
      longer a family member of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights.

  29. We accept that there are gaps in the documentation and, perhaps if  it
      were not for the divorce, the appellant might  be  in  a  position  to
      provide better documentation in the form of  bank  statements  showing
      his ex-wife's earnings.  It remains the fact, however,  that  his  ex-
      wife has been declaring income to  HMRC  and  making  income  tax  and
      national insurance contributions.

  30. Looking at all the evidence in this case, we  simply  cannot  conclude
      that that has been done  as  a  device  to  assist  the  appellant  to
      establish a false claim  under  the  2006  EEA  Regulations.   We  ask
      rhetorically, why would an individual voluntarily pay tax and national
      insurance contributions which there was no legal  obligation  (because
      the payer was not engaged  in  business  activity)  to  pay  to  HMRC?
      Despite, therefore,  some  unevenness  in  the  documentary  evidence,
      taking into account all the factors we have  set  out  above,  we  are
      satisfied that the appellant's ex-wife was  self  employed  between  8
      March 2006 and 7  March  2011.   On  that  basis,  the  appellant  was
      resident for a continuous period of 5 years as a family member  of  an
      EEA national exercising Treaty rights  and  he  acquired  a  permanent
      right of residence on that latter date under reg 15(1)(b) of the  2006
      EEA Regulations.

  31. For completeness,  we  would  add  that  we  are  satisfied  that  the
      appellant's ex-wife continued to be self employed at the date of their
      divorce on 6 July 2011 and, as we  have  already  said,  the  evidence
      clearly demonstrates that the appellant was himself  working  at  that
      date as he had been in the  preceding  years  and  continued  to  work
      subsequent to his divorce.  Consequently, even if he had not  acquired
      a permanent right of residence based upon  5  years  lawful  residence
      prior to his divorce, he retained a right of residence at the date  of
      his divorce.  We are  satisfied  that  he  continued  to  be  employed
      thereafter until he was made redundant on 10 May 2013.  As  a  result,
      following his divorce he acquired a permanent right  of  residence  by
      virtue of reg 15(1)(f) based upon 5  years'  residence  in  accordance
      with the 2006 EEA  Regulations  cumulatively  taking  account  of  his
      lawful residence as a spouse prior to his divorce  and  thereafter  on
      the basis of his retained right of residence under reg 10.

  32.  Consequently,  the  appellant  has  satisfied  us  on  a  balance  of
      probabilities that he has a permanent right of residence under reg  15
      and is entitled to a residence card as evidence of that right.

Decision

  33. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error of law and we set it aside.

  34. We remake  the  decision  allowing  the  appeal  under  the  2006  EEA
      Regulations for the reasons we have given above.
