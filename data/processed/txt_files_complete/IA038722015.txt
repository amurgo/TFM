Anonymity

I make an anonymity order, pursuant to Rule 14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008.   Unless  the  Upper   Tribunal   or   other
appropriate  Court  or  Tribunal  orders  otherwise,  no   report   of   any
proceedings or any form of publication thereof shall directly or  indirectly
identify the Appellant.  This prohibition applies to,  amongst  others,  all
parties and their representatives.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a national of Sri Lanka  born  in  1976.   It  is  now
    accepted by the Secretary of  State  that  he  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom on 8 October 2003 with a valid visa as a working  holidaymaker,
    conferring leave until 17 September 2005.  It is further accepted  that
    the appellant has remained in  the  United  Kingdom  since  that  date,
    despite entry clearance applications in his name having been  submitted
    to the Entry Clearance Officer in Colombo on 27 April 2007 and 17  July
    2007.

 2. On 25 August 2010 the  appellant  was  encountered  by  an  Immigration
    Officer on a ferry from Belfast to Scotland and  was  notified  of  his
    liability to removal as an illegal entrant.   On  12  October  2010  an
    Immigration Reporting Centre received a letter purporting  to  be  from
    the appellant asserting that he had  left  the  United  Kingdom  on  30
    August 2010.  This though turned out not to be true.   On  15  December
    2010 the appellant submitted an application for leave to remain.   This
    application was refused on 18 January 2011.  On 21 February 2014 a One-
    Stop Notice was served on the appellant, together with a  Statement  of
    Additional Grounds, which was returned on 11 April 2014 with a  request
    for consideration to be given to a claim under Article 8 ECHR.

 3. That claim was considered and rejected in a decision of 8 January 2015.
    On the same date a further decision was made to  remove  the  appellant
    from the United Kingdom.

Setting aside of FtT's decision

 4. The appellant appealed the aforementioned decision  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  That appeal  was  dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Burnett in a decision promulgated on 28 July  2015.   Broadly  speaking
    the appellant asserted before the First-tier Tribunal  that  he  should
    succeed either under the Immigration  Rules  or,  in  the  alternative,
    outwith the Rules on the basis that his removal would breach Article  8
    ECHR.

 5. In terms of the Immigration Rules the appellant asserted  that  he  met
    the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1) thereof  -  and  in  particular
    subparagraph (vi). He further submitted that he did not  fall  foul  of
    the suitability requirements in the Rules.

 6. Paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules requires an applicant to establish
    that:

         "[He] is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in  the  UK
         for less than twenty years... but there would be  very  significant
         obstacles to the applicant's integration into the country to  which
         he would have to go if required to leave the UK."

 7. In a skeleton argument put forward in support of his claim to the First-
    tier Tribunal the appellant summarised this aspect of his case  in  the
    following terms:

         "... The absence of any contacts with persons (family  or  friends)
         who could support him in Sri Lanka as well as the stigmatisation of
         homosexual persons in Sri Lanka would constitute 'very  significant
         obstacles to his integration' into Sri Lanka, especially bearing in
         mind that the appellant has lived openly as a gay person in the  UK
         for the last eleven years and has been  accepted  as  such  by  his
         friends and family.  Being removed to Sri Lanka would mean that  he
         would have to hide the fact he was gay (which  forms  part  of  his
         personal identity) and would have to hide any relationship  with  a
         man that he entered into.  This is clearly contrary  to  his  self-
         perception and openness as a gay man in the UK  where  he  has  not
         hide his sexual orientation from friends and family."

 8. As to the appellant's claim that his removal  would  breach  Article  8
    (outwith the Immigration Rules), he relied upon (a) his family life  in
    the United Kingdom with his mother and stepfather, whom it is  said  he
    cares for on a daily basis; and (b) the extent of his private  life  in
    the United Kingdom, which in particular incorporates, inter  alia,  his
    ability to act openly as a gay man here and  his  employment  with  the
    Autistic Society UK.

 9. It was submitted that as a consequence of  the  above,  when  taken  in
    conjunction with (a) the fact that he has no family to return to in Sri
    Lanka and (b) the circumstances that would appertain in Sri Lanka as  a
    consequence of his wish to live as an openly gay man, his removal would
    be disproportionate to the need to maintain immigration control.

10. As already indicated the First-tier Tribunal rejected  the  appellant's
    appeal - making the following findings of fact when doing so:

         i)   "...the appellant is not required to provide full-time  direct
             care or personal care to his mother or stepfather" [37];

         ii)  "...his P60 shows he earnt �27, 577 to the year  ending  April
             2014; a similar figure in 2011; a slightly  higher  amount  in
             2013 and a slightly lower amount (�26,020) to the year end  in
             2015." [37]

         iii) "Given the paucity of evidence to confirm that  the  appellant
             is gay I do not accept it. The appellant has  provided  little
             in support and there are no  letters  from  friends,  or  work
             colleagues to confirm this. I hence give this factor no weight
             in my assessment of the appellant's private and family  life."
             [38]

         iv)  "...given the appellant has spent the  vast  majority  of  his
             life in Sri Lanka and that he has managed to work  in  the  UK
             for the last eight years, he will be able  to  integrate  back
             into society in Sri Lanka. The appellant also has  a  property
             asset which will help his transition." [39]

11. The appellant obtained permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  and,
    subsequently, in a decision of 29 April 2016 I set aside the First-tier
    Tribunal's determination for the following reasons:

         "4.  At the core of the appeal before the  Upper  Tribunal  is  the
         First-tier Tribunal's consideration, under paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)
         of the Immigration Rules, of  whether  there  would  be  any  'very
         significant obstacles' to  the  appellant's  integration  into  the
         country to which he would have to go if required to  leave  the  UK
         i.e. Sri Lanka.

         5.   A significant part of  the  appellant's  case  on  this  issue
         before the First-tier Tribunal revolved around his claim to be  gay
         and the consequences for him upon  return  to  Sri  Lanka  directly
         relating to this fact. This was  not  an  issue  addressed  by  the
         Secretary of State in  her  refusal  letter.  In  particular,  that
         letter gave no indication that the Secretary  of  State  sought  to
         dispute the appellant's claims to be gay.

         6.   The respondent did not appear and was not  represented  before
         the First-tier Tribunal and, as far as can be ascertained from  its
         decision, the tribunal itself did not directly put to the appellant
         that his assertions in this regard were not true.

         7.   At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal  Mr  Norton  properly
         accepted: (i) that there was  an  unlawful  inadequacy  of  reasons
         provided by the First-tier Tribunal for rejecting the truth of  the
         appellant's assertion to be gay; and, (ii) if the appellant is  gay
         as claimed, this is capable of having  a  material  impact  on  the
         issue of whether there would be very significant obstacles  to  the
         appellant's integration into Sri Lanka. As  a  consequence  of  the
         aforementioned, Mr Norton accepted that the  First-tier  Tribunal's
         decision was vitiated by  legal  error  capable  of  affecting  the
         outcome of the appeal and that it should be set aside. I agree  and
         do just that."

Re-making of decision under appeal

12. The re-making of  the  decision  was  adjourned  so  as  to  allow  the
    appellant to obtain further evidence in support  of  his  claim  to  be
    openly gay and expert evidence as to the consequences of this fact upon
    his return to Sri Lanka.

13. Having briefly heard evidence  from  the  appellant,  his  mother,  his
    stepfather and Mr Rodriquez, Mr  Norton  sensibly  made  the  following
    concessions of fact on behalf of the Secretary of State:

      i) The appellant has lived in the United  Kingdom  continuously  since
         2003;

     ii) The appellant is gay;

    iii) The appellant has a family life with his mother and  stepfather  in
         the United Kingdom.

Paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) - Discussion and Decision

14. The only issue I need now determine  under  the  Immigration  Rules  is
    whether the appellant can establish to  the  balance  of  probabilities
    that "there would be very significant obstacles  to  [his]  integration
    into the country to which [he] would have to go if  required  to  leave
    the United Kingdom" (i.e. Sri Lanka).

15. In this regard Mr Norton, broadly, submitted  that  the  appellant  was
    doing no more than asserting, albeit  not  within  the  confines  of  a
    protection claim, that he would be  at  risk  of  being  persecuted  if
    returned to Sri Lanka. He asserted that there was  no  evidence  before
    the Tribunal which should lead it to depart from the findings  on  this
    issue in the recent country guidance decision from the  Upper  Tribunal
    (LH and IP (gay men: risk) Sri Lanka CG [2015] UKUT 00073).  In  short,
    he submitted there was no risk of the appellant  suffering  persecutory
    treatment upon return to Sri Lanka as a consequence of him  being  gay,
    whether openly  or  not,  and,  consequently,  the  appellant  had  not
    demonstrated  there  were  any  very  significant  obstacles   to   his
    integration.

16. Mr Norton further reminded the Tribunal that it is for the appellant to
    demonstrate  to  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  he  meets   the
    requirements of the Rules, a higher standard than would be the case  if
    he were pursuing a protection based  claim  on  Refugee  Convention  or
    Article 3 ECHR grounds.

17. The Tribunal's attention was directed to the fact  that  the  appellant
    would be returned to Sri  Lanka  in  circumstances  where  he  has  the
    financial means to assist in  his  integration.   In  this  regard  the
    appellant gave evidence before  the  Upper  Tribunal  that  he  owns  a
    property in London with an approximate value of �275,000, and which has
    a mortgage against  it  of  only  �187,000;  thus,  it  was  said,  the
    appellant would  have  approximately  �88,000  to  assist  him  in  his
    integration back into Sri Lanka. Alternatively, it was asserted, if the
    appellant were to  continue  to  rent  out  this  property,  as  he  is
    currently doing for �950 per month whilst only having to pay a mortgage
    of �400 per month, he would have an income of  approximately  �550  per
    month on which to live in Sri  Lanka  -  without  the  need  to  obtain
    employment there.

18. It was submitted that in all  the  circumstances  the  appellant  comes
    nowhere  near  demonstrating  that  there  would  be  very  significant
    obstacles to his integration into life in Sri Lanka.

19. Turning to Article 8 ECHR outside the Rules,  Mr  Norton  reminded  the
    Tribunal of the significant weight that must be attached to the  public
    interest in maintaining immigration control and that the appellant must
    demonstrate exceptional or compelling features  over  and  above  those
    identified within the Rules in order to succeed in his claim outside of
    the Rules.

20. He accepted, as already identified above,  that  the  appellant  has  a
    family life with his mother and stepfather in the United  Kingdom.   As
    to the appellant's employment in the UK, Mr Norton identified that this
    had been undertaken unlawfully,  the  appellant  not  having  leave  to
    remain at the time of the employment.

21.  Mr  Norton  also  asserted  that  section  117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 requires little weight to  be  attached
    to both the appellant's private life and family life  in  circumstances
    where that life had been built up whilst  the  appellant's  immigration
    status was unlawful.  It was further observed that the  appellant  does
    not claim to be in a subsisting relationship with a partner in the  UK,
    neither does he have any children here.

22. In response  Mr  Doerfel  relied  upon  the  contents  of  two  helpful
    documents he had produced on the appellant's  behalf:  (i)  a  skeleton
    argument dated 2 November 2016 and (ii) a document containing "Excerpts
    from the HRW Report 'all five fingers are not  the  same'"[1].  I  have
    taken full account of these  documents  and  the  documents  referenced
    therein.

23. He confirmed that although there was a significant amount of background
    material before the Tribunal, including a report  of  21  October  2016
    from Ms Flamer-Caldera drawn on behalf of Equal Ground (an organisation
    which supports LGBTI persons in Sri Lanka and which  gave  evidence  to
    the Tribunal in LH and IP),  the  passages  upon  which  the  appellant
    placed reliance were referenced in  the  two  documents  identified  in
    paragraph 22 above. I observe at this juncture  that  Mr  Doerfel  also
    quite properly accepted that Ms Flamer-Caldera's report  was  deficient
    in that there was an absence of any  attempt  therein  to  address  the
    findings in LH and IP. In addition,  substantial  reliance  was  placed
    therein on material which pre-dated LH  &  IP.  I  have,  nevertheless,
    considered the contents of this report in the round  with  all  of  the
    other evidence before me.

24. In summary, Mr Doerfel asserted on the appellant's behalf that: (i) the
    background evidence demonstrated to the balance of  probabilities  that
    there would be very significant obstacles to  the  appellant  obtaining
    employment in Sri Lanka because he would be discriminated against as  a
    consequence of being a gay man; (ii) the appellant would be  unable  to
    access healthcare facilities should he need  to  do  so  for  the  same
    reason;  (iii)  the  appellant  would  be  at  risk  of  being  abused,
    stigmatised and discriminated against by  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities
    and/or the public, if they were to become aware that he is a  gay  man;
    and, (iv) there would be very significant obstacles  to  the  appellant
    obtaining accommodation in Sri Lanka as a consequence of  being  a  gay
    man.

25. He submitted that the above  matters,  whether  taken  individually  or
    cumulatively, are such as to  demonstrate  that  there  would  be  very
    significant obstacles to the appellant's integration into life  in  Sri
    Lanka.

26. I now turn to my consideration of the appellant's  claim  to  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules. At  the  core  of
    this claim is the fact that the appellant is an openly gay man and that
    he would continue to act openly in Sri Lanka - an assertion I accept.

27. As identified above the Upper  Tribunal  has  recently  considered  the
    risks for gay men in Sri Lanka in LH and IP, concluding as follows:


          1) "Having regard to the provisions of articles 365  and  365A  of
             the Sri  Lankan  Penal  Code,  gay  men  in  Sri  Lanka  are  a
             particular social group.



          2) 'Gay men in civil partnerships' in Sri Lanka do not  constitute
             a particular social group  for  the  purposes  of  the  Refugee
             Convention. The Sri Lankan authorities'  failure  to  recognise
             alternative marital and quasi-marital statuses  such  as  civil
             partnership or homosexual marriage which are available in other
             countries of the world does not,  without  more,  amount  to  a
             flagrant breach of core human rights.


          3) Applying the test set out by Lord Rodger in the  Supreme  Court
             judgment in HJ and HT, in general the treatment of gay  men  in
             Sri Lanka does not reach the standard of persecution or serious
             harm.


          4) There is a significant population of homosexuals and other LGBT
             individuals in Sri Lanka,  in  particular  in  Colombo.   While
             there is more risk for lesbian  and  bisexual  women  in  rural
             areas,  because  of  the  control  exercised  by  families   on
             unmarried  women,  and  for  transgender  individuals  and  sex
             workers in the cities, it will be a question  of  fact  whether
             for a particular individual the risk reaches the  international
             protection standard, and  in  particular,  whether  it  extends
             beyond their home area.



          5) Where a risk of  persecution  or  serious  harm  exists  in  an
             appellant's home area, there  may  be  an  internal  relocation
             option, particularly for individuals returning via Colombo from
             the United Kingdom.


          6) The lack of  recognition  of  alternative  marital  and  quasi-
             marital  statuses  such  as  civil  partnership  or  homosexual
             marriage which are available in other countries of the world is
             not of itself capable of amounting to a flagrant breach of  the
             appellants' right to respect for family life on return  to  Sri
             Lanka.

28. Whilst I accept Mr Doerfel's submission that  the  appellant  does  not
    need to demonstrate that he would  suffer  persecutory  treatment  upon
    return to Sri Lanka in order to succeed in meeting the requirements  of
    Paragraph 276ADE  of  the  Rules,  the  findings  in  LH  and  IP  are,
    nevertheless, relevant to such a consideration. The Tribunal  undertook
    an analysis therein of a great deal  of  evidence  (including  evidence
    from two country experts - one whom, Ms Flamer-Caldera,  also  provided
    evidence in the instant appeal) as to the circumstances in  Sri  Lanka,
    and in particular Colombo, for openly gay men.

29. I first remind myself that the appellant will be returning to Sri Lanka
    as a person of not insignificant financial means.  The Tribunal has not
    been provided  with  copies  of  the  appellant's  bank  statements  to
    identify his current liquid assets but even absent such information the
    appellant accepted in his evidence that he owns a property with  equity
    to the value of approximately �88,000, which he  can  either  liquidate
    (in which case I accept that the monies may  be  subjected  to  capital
    gains tax) or, alternatively,  he  could  continue  to  receive  rental
    income on the  property  which  currently  yields  a  gross  profit  of
    approximately �500 per month.

30. These figures must be viewed in the context of the evidence  before  me
    relating to the national minimum wage  in  the  public  sector  in  Sri
    Lanka, which is said to be US$228 per month, the "poverty income level"
    that is identified as being US$7.5 per month, and the  minimum  monthly
    wage in areas of the private sector covered by a "wage  boards",  which
    is said to be US$61 per month (US State Department Country  Reports  on
    Human Rights Practice for 2015).

31. Moving on, Mr Doerfel correctly observes that sections 365 and 365A  of
    the Sri Lankan Penal Code create criminal offences in relation  to  the
    commission of homosexual acts.  However, as identified in LH (paragraph
    107) there have been few if any prosecutions and no  convictions  under
    these provisions.  Mr Doerfel does not suggest otherwise,  but  submits
    that it is this criminal legislation which underpins stigmatisation  of
    homosexual activity in Sri Lanka, and gives it a legitimacy  which,  of
    itself, amounts to a very serious obstacle to integration.

32. I reject this submission.  It  is  not  enough  for  the  appellant  to
    establish the existence of stigmatisation of gay persons in  Sri  Lanka
    as criminals - whatever the origin of such stigmatisation. The question
    that requires determination is whether there is, in any given  case,  a
    very significant obstacle to integration.  In  order  to  resolve  this
    issue a decision maker must, on the facts of the individual case,  look
    not only at whether such stigmatisation exists but, if it does, to  the
    consequences of such stigmatisation in the particular case.

33. The Tribunal in LH and IP gave careful consideration to  the  issue  of
    stigmatisation of homosexual men  in  Sri  Lanka  and,  in  particular,
    considered a report authored by Equal Ground in December 2012  relating
    to the topic, as well as other background evidence including  a  report
    from Ms Flamer-Caldera.

34. Nothing in the evidence before me leads me to conclude, on the  balance
    probabilities,  any  differently  to  that  which  the  Upper  Tribunal
    concluded in LH and IP. It accepted,  as  I  do,  that  that  there  is
    violence and extortion perpetrated against gay men in Sri  Lanka,  with
    male sex workers being more vulnerable to such actions. There have,  in
    particular, been instances in which gay men have been  the  subject  of
    abuse (including arrest by the police) as a direct consequence  of  the
    criminalisation of homosexual acts. Some incidents are at  the  serious
    end of the scale (paragraph  111  of  LH);  however,  these  incidents,
    whilst underreported, are nevertheless low/few in number.

35. I have paid full regard to the aforementioned  when  assessing  whether
    there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles   to   the   appellant's
    integration into Sri Lanka.

36. Moving on, I reject Mr Doerfel's assertion that the background evidence
    demonstrates that homosexuality and paedophilia are equated  within  an
    'important strata' of Sri Lankan society.  The source of this suggested
    equation is, according to Mr Doerfel's skeleton  argument,  an  unnamed
    "rights activist" who made a comment to this effect  to  the  Gay  Star
    News in 2013 after a Buddhist monk was arrested  for  allegedly  having
    sex with five under age boys.  The same newspaper reported that earlier
    in 2013 that Sri Lankan police officers  made  presentations  on  child
    abuse, stating that "homosexuality was the leading cause of child abuse
    in Sri Lanka".

37. Looking at all the evidence as a whole, I accept that  there  is  some,
    albeit limited, evidence that a small minority of  individuals  in  Sri
    Lanka hold  such  views.  However,  the  evidence  comes  nowhere  near
    demonstrating to the balance of probabilities that this is a view  held
    by any more than a tiny minority of the general populace, nor  does  it
    demonstrate that it is a view held by  an  'important  strata'  of  Sri
    Lankan society.

38. I come to ostensibly the same conclusion in relation  to  Mr  Doerfel's
    assertion that there is a belief that LGBT people are  "mentally  ill",
    "unnatural" and/or  "spread  HIV  and  AIDS"  in  Sri  Lanka.   I  have
    considered all of the evidence referred  to  by  Mr  Doerfel  on  these
    matters, in particular that identified in his skeleton argument and the
    2016 Human Rights Watch Report. Having done  so  I,  again,  find  that
    whilst it is clear that there are persons in Sri Lanka hold such  views
    I do not  accept  that  they  are  widespread.  More  significantly,  I
    conclude that it has not been established that the  existence  of  such
    views would impinge upon the appellant's abilities  to  integrate  into
    Sri Lankan life to any significant extent, if at all.

39. Mr Doerfel submits, more generally, that the appellant would  suffer  a
    high level of discrimination in his interaction with people in both the
    public and private spheres of his life. Broken down into its  component
    parts Mr Doerfel  relies,  in  particular,  on  discrimination  against
    openly gay people in employment, healthcare and housing.

40. I have given consideration to the evidence on such matters,  which  has
    helpfully been identified with some care by  Mr  Doerfel.  Once  again,
    however, when such evidence is analysed, and taken  together  with  the
    evidence referred to elsewhere in relation to  the  criminalisation  of
    homosexuality and stigmatisation of homosexuals etc., it comes  nowhere
    near demonstrating that there would be very  significant  obstacles  to
    this appellant's integration into life in Sri Lanka.

41. I accept that there is some discrimination in employment of  those  who
    are known to be, or who are perceived to be,  gay  men.   The  material
    before me  does  not  demonstrate,  however,  that  the  difficulty  in
    obtaining, or keeping, employment in Sri Lanka for such persons  is  of
    the scale claimed by Mr Doerfel, or of a scale such as to  lead  me  to
    the  conclusion  that  on  balance  there  would  be  very  significant
    obstacles to the appellant obtaining employment - even  assuming  there
    is a need for him to do so given the  monies  he  already  has  at  his
    disposal as a consequence of his property  ownership  in  the  UK  (see
    above).

42. In  this  regard  I  observe,  for  example,  that  Equal  Ground,  the
    organisation on the ground  in  Sri  Lanka  supporting  LGBTI  persons,
    reports only 2 to 3 complaints a month relating  to  discrimination  in
    employment. Although the report also suggests, and I accept,  that  the
    actual prevalence is much higher (and indeed that there is  a  lack  of
    legal redress against such  discrimination),  this  is  nevertheless  a
    small number in the context of the estimated number of LGBTI persons in
    Sri Lanka. It is for the appellant  to  make  out  his  case,  and  the
    evidence before me does not lead me to find that  there  would  be  any
    significant difficulties  in  the  appellant  obtaining  employment  in
    Colombo even if he were known to be gay.

43. As to access to healthcare, it is not said that the appellant  requires
    such access at present; indeed, he gave evidence that he had no current
    medical issues.  Equal Ground's report asserts that LGBTI  persons  are
    unable to access proper healthcare facilities for  fear  of  disclosing
    their  sexual  orientation,  however,  there  is  no  source  for   the
    information said to underpin such conclusion. I  further  observe  that
    the author of this report also gave evidence to the Upper  Tribunal  in
    LH - the following being recorded in the Tribunal's decision at [50]:

         "Ms Flamer-Caldera agreed that there was not much evidence  in  the
         pilot study or elsewhere  regarding  discrimination  against  LGBTI
         individuals in the provision of healthcare, but she said  this  was
         explained by the  fact  that  most  gays  did  not  disclose  their
         orientation when requesting healthcare. The  Pilot  Study  did  not
         reflect the true situation. Equal Ground  dealt  with  hundreds  of
         reports per month which disclosed major discrimination."

44. The 2016 Human Rights Watch report identifies that doctors and  medical
    staff are often unaware, or insensitive to, the health  care  needs  of
    LTBTI persons. There is also  reference  therein  to  the  belief  that
    transgender persons are mentally ill, but that is not relevant to  this
    case. This  report  does  not  disclose  a  general  discrimination  in
    healthcare facilities for those who disclose that they are openly  gay.



45. Looking at the evidence as a whole, in my conclusion it discloses  that
    there have been a number of incidents of discrimination against gay men
    in the healthcare sector in Sri Lanka. It does not  disclose,  however,
    that such incidents are significant in number  or  that  there  is  any
    refusal to treat, or provide care for, gay men.

46. Moving on the question of  housing.  The  appellant  will,  of  course,
    require accommodation upon return to Sri Lanka.  As  has  already  been
    identified he is person of significant financial  means,  even  without
    obtaining employment in Sri Lanka. He certainly has sufficient funds to
    pay for accommodation upon his return.

47.  Mr  Doerfel  asserts,  however,  that  potential  landlords  would  be
    reluctant to rent out a property to the appellant once he is known,  or
    believed, to be gay.  The  evidence  relied  upon  in  this  regard  is
    primarily found in the Equal Ground report of 2013, which itself relies
    on a 2011 study identifying that  24%  of  respondents  indicated  that
    within the past 2 years they had either been unable to rent housing, or
    forced to change housing due to their sexual  orientation.  Little,  if
    anything, else is known about this study - in particular what  criteria
    were used to choose the pool of respondents, how many respondents there
    were (unless this is also the Pilot Study referred to in LH,  in  which
    case it is known that there were 119 interviews  of  persons  known  to
    Equal Ground[2]), what the respondents were asked and how  the  results
    were analysed. I further observe that in its  most  recent  report  (of
    2016) Human Rights Watch indicate that it "encountered  several  people
    who said they faced discrimination in  accessing...housing  because  of
    their actual or perceived gender  identity  or  sexual  orientation..."
    (emphasis added)

48. Looking at all the evidence before in  the  round,  I  am  prepared  to
    accept that there will be individual landlords who do not wish to  rent
    property to LGBT persons. However, I do not accept that this is of such
    a scale that it has been established that the appellant would be unable
    to obtain suitable accommodation in Colombo, even if  he  discloses  to
    potential landlords that he is openly gay.

49. Looking at the individual circumstances of this appellant,  and  taking
    account of the background evidence before me as well as everything that
    is said by Mr Doerfel on the appellant's behalf (cumulatively, and even
    if not specifically referred  to  above)  I  do  not  accept  that  the
    appellant has come close to  establishing  that  there  would  be  very
    significant obstacles  to  his  integration  into  Sri  Lanka,  and  in
    particular Colombo.

50. The appellant therefore does not meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    276ADE(1) of the Immigration Rules  -  nor  indeed  does  he  meet  the
    requirements of any other Immigration Rules.

Article 8 ECHR (outwith the Rules)



  51. I must now turn to give consideration of Article 8  ECHR  outwith  the
      Rules. Since the appellant cannot show that he is entitled to leave to
      remain under the Immigration Rules, he has  to  show  some  compelling
      reason why leave to remain should be granted outside  the  Rules  (see
      Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803 at [18]). This is not a legal  threshold,
      but a recognition of the weight that is to be attached to  the  public
      interest in not granting leave to remain to those persons who  do  not
      meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules - the  SSHD's  view  of
      the public interest being identified through those Rules.




  52. In coming to my conclusions I am required to take into  account  those
      matters identified in part 5A  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
      Asylum Act 2002, which relevantly provides:

           "PART 5A
           ARTICLE 8 OF THE ECHR: PUBLIC INTEREST CONSIDERATIONS
           117A Application of this Part
           (1) This Part applies where a court or tribunal is  required  to
           determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-
                 (a) breaches a person's right to respect  for  private  and
                 family life under Article 8, and
                 (b) as a result would be unlawful under section  6  of  the
                 Human Rights Act 1998.
           (2) In considering the public interest question,  the  court  or
           tribunal must (in particular) have regard-
                 (a) in all cases, to the considerations listed  in  section
                 117B, and
                 (b)  in  cases  concerning  the  deportation   of   foreign
                 criminals, to the considerations listed in section 117C.
           (3) In subsection (2), "the public interest question" means  the
           question of whether an interference with  a  person's  right  to
           respect for private and family life is justified  under  Article
           8(2).
           117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
           cases
           (1)The maintenance of effective immigration controls is  in  the
           public interest.
           (2) It is in the public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           able to speak English, because persons who can speak English-
                 (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
                 (b) are better able to integrate into society.
           (3) It is in the public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           financially independent, because such persons-
                 (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
                 (b) are better able to integrate into society.
           (4) Little weight should be given to-
                 (a) a private life, or
                 (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
           that is established by a person at a time when the person is  in
           the United Kingdom unlawfully.
           (5) Little weight should be given to a private life  established
           by a person at a time when the person's  immigration  status  is
           precarious.
           (6) In the case of a person who is not  liable  to  deportation,
           the public interest does not require the person's removal where-
                 (a) the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                 relationship with a qualifying child, and
                 (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave
                 the United Kingdom.


  53. It is not disputed  that  the  appellant  has  amassed  a  significant
      private life in the United Kingdom. He has lived here  for  11  years,
      has family members and friends here, and has employment  as  a  senior
      carer - having obtained qualifications in Health and  Social  Care.  I
      have taken all the evidence that has bene put before me in this regard
      into consideration.




  54. Although the FtT did not accept there to be  family  life  in  the  UK
      between the appellant and his mother and step father, the existence of
      such has now been conceded by the Secretary of State. Such  concession
      must be founded on an acceptance  that  there  is,  and  has  been,  a
      dependency by the appellant's mother and step-father on the appellant.
      This dependency is  expressed  in  the  evidence  in  terms  that  the
      appellant "shops, cleans and cooks for them and accompanies his mother
      to medical appointments." I accept this to be so. The evidence further
      discloses that the appellant's mother is aged in her early sixties and
      his step-father in his mid-eighties. The appellant's mother has health
      problems, inter alia, high blood pressure, knee and ankle problems.




  55. It is plain that the appellant's removal from the UK  would  interfere
      with both his private and family life  here,  and  I  find  that  such
      interference is of sufficient gravity so as to engage Article 8.




  56. I now turn to the question of whether, given the  family  and  private
      life accumulated by the appellant in the United Kingdom,  his  removal
      would be proportionate to the public interest in  the  maintenance  of
      immigration control. I conclude that it would.




  57. As already identified significant  weight  must  be  attached  to  the
      maintenance  of  immigration  control,  the  public   interest   being
      reflected in the requirements of the Immigration Rules - none of which
      the appellant can meet. The fact that the appellant can speak  English
      and has not been a burden  on  the  taxpayer  are  matters  which  are
      neutral in my considerations.




  58. For the most part the appellant has accumulated his private life  ties
      in the United Kingdom at a time when he was not lawfully here. He  did
      have leave for a time in 2003 to 2005, but even  during  such  period,
      his entitlement to remain here was precarious (see Rhuppiah).




  59. Section 117B(5) of the 2002 Act requires that I should  accord  little
      weight should to the private life the appellant has accumulated in the
      UK whilst his stay was precarious. I remind myself, however, that this
      is only 'generalised normative guidance' (Rhuppiah at [53])  and  that
      this may be overridden in an exceptional case by  particularly  strong
      features of the private life in question. In this  regard  Mr  Doerfel
      particularly relies upon both the appellant's ability to be openly gay
      in the United Kingdom, and  the  fact  that  his  employment  involves
      bonding with, and caring for, both adults and children with autism.




  60. As to the former, I have already concluded that  there  are  not  very
      significant obstacles to the appellant integrating into Sri  Lanka  in
      circumstances where he continues to be openly gay. I take into account
      here all that I have previously said and concluded on this issue.




  61. As to the employment in the UK, there is no evidence that other carers
      cannot be employed to take over the appellant's  role  and,  whilst  I
      have no doubt that the persons he  has  bonded  with  will  feel  some
      anguish at the fact that he is no longer undertaking his  caring  role
      there is no evidence that this would be anything other  than  for  the
      short term.




  62. I have identified above the constituent elements  of  the  appellant's
      family life in the United Kingdom. Looking at the consequences of  the
      appellant's return to Sri Lanka on the individuals in the family,  the
      appellant asserts, and I accept, that his mother and step-father  "...
      cannot afford to travel to  Sri  Lanka  frequently"  (the  appellant's
      mother last travelled there in 2013). He wants them to remain in their
      own home and  does  not  want  them  to  go  into  a  care  home.  The
      appellant's mother does not express a concern about moving to  a  care
      home, but does identify (i) that her travel  to  Sri  Lanka  would  be
      infrequent and (ii) that she would  be  worried  for  the  appellant's
      safety if he were to return to Sri Lanka. The appellant's  step-father
      states that he does not wish to go into  a  care  home  "in  the  very
      foreseeable future" and that this would likely  be  the  case  if  the
      appellant were not able to assist them as he does now.




  63. Although there is a preference on behalf of the family members to have
      the care needs attended to by the appellant, and although  there  will
      no doubt be emotional stress may be caused to all  if  they  are  not,
      there is no evidence that such care arrangements cannot be  undertaken
      by persons other than the appellant - including  as  arranged  by  the
      state; nor is there anything preventing those needs being attended  to
      in a 'care home' if that is what is required.  There  is  no  evidence
      before me that withdrawal of the appellant  from  the  current  family
      home (as a consequence of his  removal  to  Sri  Lanka)  will  have  a
      materially adverse effect on the physical, or long term mental, health
      of the appellant's mother or step-father.




  64. Taking the appellant's  family  and  private  life  cumulatively,  and
      considering the consequences of his return to Sri Lanka in relation to
      each, as well as the circumstances that will pertain for the appellant
      upon return to Sri Lanka, I have  no  hesitation  in  concluding  that
      requiring the appellant to leave the UK is entirely  proportionate  to
      the weighty public interest in maintaining immigration control.
