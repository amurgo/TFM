                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The appellant is a national of Ghana, born on 3 June 1989. On 14 May
       2016 she sought confirmation she was entitled to permanent residence
       on the basis of European Treaty rights. This was premised on her
       being a dependent family member of an EEA national (hereinafter
       referred to as her sponsor). She is required to have resided in the
       United Kingdom in accordance with the Immigration (European Economic
       Area) Regulations 2006 (hereinafter referred to as 2006 regs) for a
       continuous period of 5 years.

    2. The sponsor is her mother, Ms Gladys Opuku. She was born on 15 July
       1963 and is a national of the Netherlands. The application stated
       that she had been working in the United Kingdom from April 2005 to
       the time of application.

    3. Her application was refused on 10 November 2015 on the basis she had
       not shown she had resided in accordance with the regulations of 5
       years. The refusal letter states that she had not demonstrated
       dependency upon her sponsor. The evidence she supplied related to her
       own employment since December 2011 and she had not provided evidence
       of any financial support from her sponsor. Consequently, she was not
       considered to be a dependent family member as defined in regulation
       7(1)(b) of the 2006 regulations.

    4. The grounds of appeal contended that the appellant sponsor had
       supported her through her studies.

The First tier Tribunal

    5. Her appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Young Harry. The
       judge found that the sponsor had been exercising Treaty rights
       continuously since at least April 2005. The appellant's evidence was
       that while she was a student she also took employment and was reliant
       upon her mother to meet essential needs. She said her parents paid
       her course fees and assisted with the cost of accommodation.

    6. She said she had earned no more than �300 a month whereas the
       presenting officer contended she was earning �200 a week. The judge
       accepted the respondent's argument in this regard. The judge accepted
       that her mother at some stage paid some of her university fees but
       the evidence did not indicate how much or over what period. The judge
       also accept that the appellant lived mainly at her parents address
       outside of term time and received a nominal sum from her parents when
       at home. However, the judge did not feel she was dependent.

   The Upper Tribunal

    7. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis the judge's finding
       that an income of �11,000 per annum was sufficient for the appellant
       to be independent was wrong. It was argued the conclusion she was
       independent was flawed as she continued to reside rent free with her
       parents.

    8. The respondent has lodged a rule 24 response submitting the judge
       directed himself correctly and on the evidence the appellant had not
       been frank in her account of her circumstances and the judge was
       entitled to conclude she had not been dependent on her sponsor for
       some time.

    9. At hearing Mr Dewa submitted that the appellant was dependent upon
       her mother. He said she was attending university and the fees were
       paid by her parents. Outside of term time she lived with her parents.
       I was not referred to any authorities as to what would be considered
       adequate dependency. In response, Ms Aboni continued to rely upon the
       rule 24 response and submitted that the grounds and the oral
       representations in the upper tribunal were an attempt to reargue the
       appeal. He submitted that the judge had directed himself
       appropriately and made findings that were open to the judge.

   10. Paragraph's 2,3 and 8 of the decision show the judge correctly
       identified the issue to be determined. The Judge found as a fact that
       her sponsor had been exercising Treaty rights over the necessary
       period. Connected to this then was a question of the appellant's
       dependency upon her sponsor as she was over 21 years of age.

   11. The judge found that the appellant in her oral evidence sought to
       suggest she earned less than she did. The judge at paragraph 17
       referred to the absence of evidence to support her claim that the
       sponsor met her essential needs. This reflects the refusal letter
       which refers to the absence of money transfers in her bank account
       from her mother.

   12. The judge did accept that the appellant outside of term time normally
       resided at her parents' home and that they would give her nominal
       sums. However, the judge concluded the evidence did not support her
       claim that she was or is dependent on her sponsor. The judge did not
       accept that she could not survive on her income alone. The judge
       rejected the appellant's claim that her sponsor continued to support
       her by paying for her travel and lunch money whilst at work. The
       judge at paragraph 21 referred to the absence of recent payslips and
       inferred the appellant was not being frank about her income.

Conclusions

   13. It is for the appellant through her representative to demonstrate a
       material error of law in the decision. I do not find this
       established. Rather, the appeal was dismissed on the proofs and it
       has not been shown the judge erred in law in doing so.

   14. The judge has to assess the evidence presented. No challenge was made
       to the factual findings made by the judge. The judge had some details
       of her earnings and found she had sought to underplay her income. The
       appellant's recent wage slips had not been provided. There were wage
       slips covering the period between 2011 and 2012 which indicated
       earnings of up to �200 a week. At paragraph 16 the judge rejected her
       claim that she was earning only �300 a month over the 5 years. The
       judge concluded that the earnings found were adequate for her to be
       independent.

   15. Permission was granted primarily on the basis that an income of
       �11,000 per annum would be insufficient for the appellant to be
       independent of her sponsor. I have not received submissions
       specifically on this point of quantification.

   16. The grounds upon which permission was granted are confusing. The last
       half,  marked para 30 onwards, appears to have been cut-and-pasted
       from another case. There is a shorthand reference to some case law.
       The reference to Yunying Jia is presumably a reference to Jia
       Migrationsverket Case C 1/05.There the European Court considered
       "dependence" meant that members of the family of an EU national
       established in another Member State needed the material support of
       that EU national, or his or her spouse, in order to meet their
       essential needs. This test is reflected in the Reasons for Refusal.

   17. Reyes v Migrationsverket (Case C-423/12) CJEU (Fourth Chamber), 16
       January 2014 was also alluded to in the grounds. It was concerned
       with payments to the descendant necessary in order to support her in
       the country of origin which is not the situation here.

   18. As stated, the judge's factual findings have not been challenged. The
       argument appears to relate to quantification and whether �10,000 per
       anum is adequate. Although comparators were not given from
       information in the public domain it is of note that a single person
       over 25 currently would receive in the region of �73 per week in
       Income Support. I appreciate they would also be entitled to housing
       assistance etc. The case law suggests it is necessary to consider
       what material support is provided and then see if it is necessary for
       the persons essential needs. The application was refused on the
       proofs being inadequate and the judge dismissed the appeal on the
       same basis. Consequently, I find no material error of law
       established.

   19. No material error of law has been shown in the decision of First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Young Harry. Consequently, that decision dismissing
       the appeal shall stand.

Decision

       The appeal is dismissed
