Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms Ikiriko of Melrose Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Walker, Senior Home Officer Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria and he  was  born  on  1  January
    1980.

 2. The appeal is against the decision dated  9  April  2013  made  on  the
    papers by First-tier Tribunal Judge Foudy which  dismissed  the  appeal
    against the respondent's decision of 11 January 2013 to refuse to issue
    a residence card as confirmation of a right to  reside  in  the  United
    Kingdom (UK) as the spouse of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights.



 3. The appellant maintains that he and the sponsor, Ms  Cornelie  Aidy,  a
    French national, underwent a customary marriage in Nigeria by proxy  on
    3 February 2013.

 4. The respondent did not accept that the marriage was valid,  relying  on
    the United States State Department Reciprocity Schedule which stated as
    of 17 October 2011 that both parties to the marriage had to be  present
    to sign marriage documents and that proxy marriages had  ceased  to  be
    valid but still occurred.  The  respondent  also  considered  that  the
    photographs of the couple had  little  probative  value  and  that  the
    couple having failed to attend two interviews was further evidence that
    the marriage was not genuine or subsisting.

 5. I had little hesitation in finding that the determination of the First-
    tier Tribunal  disclosed material errors of law such that it should  be
    set aside and re-made. It was not open  to  the  judge  to  reject  the
    affidavit dated 3 February 2012 of the Grade C Customary Court  because
    of the use of the words "consummate" and "consanants".  The  judge  was
    also incorrect at [11] to state that no explanation had been given  for
    the failure to attend  interviews  with  the  respondent.  The  witness
    statement of the appellant and sponsor both contained explanations.

 6. I proceeded to re-make the appeal with the  assistance  of  submissions
    from Ms Ikiriko and Mr Walker and the  evidence  that  was  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and the new materials for  the  appellant  provided
    under a cover letter dated 19 August 2013.

 7. The appellant submits that the country  evidence  relied  upon  by  the
    respondent to show that proxy customary  marriages  are  not  valid  in
    Nigeria related to civil marriage not customary marriage,  so  was  not
    relevant. The couple were  not  required  to  be  present  at  a  proxy
    customary marriage. The  respondent's  Country  of  Origin  Information
    Report (COIR) dated 6 April 2011 confirmed that customary marriage  was
    still valid in Nigeria. The documents  from  the  Oyo  Customary  Court
    showed that the proxy customary marriage of the appellant  and  sponsor
    had been recognised as lawful in Nigeria so  should  be  recognised  as
    lawful in the UK.

 8. The COIR from June 2013 states as follows on proxy customary  marriages
    in Nigeria:


        "Proxy marriage


        Users should note that sources quoted below appeared to provide
        inconsistent
        information on the legal status of proxy marriages in Nigeria.


        23.26 The US State Department Reciprocity Schedule, in an undated
        section on marriage certificates in the country, accessed 4
        December 2012, recorded that: ... both parties to the marriage
        technically must be physically present at the same location with
        witnesses to sign certain marriage documents, proxy marriages have
        ceased to be valid but still occur.'


        23.27 However a letter from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to
        the UK Border Agency of 1 February 2013, provided by the British
        High Commission following consultation with their honorary legal
        adviser, observed in response to the following questions:


              'Are proxy marriages recognised as being legal by the Federal
           Government of
              Nigeria?


              Proxy marriage is a fairly common practice amongst
              communities in Nigeria. It is recognised under Nigerian
              customary law as a form of customary law marriage. A marriage
              is by proxy where the presence of the bride and groom is not
              required at the ceremony. In most cases, it is celebrated by
              the immediate and extended family of the bride and groom...
              Proxy marriages find their origin in the fact that under
              customary law, marriage creates a relationship not only
              between the parties to the marriage but also between their
              families. Because customary law marriages are legally binding
              and recognised as one of the types of marriages in Nigeria,
              proxy marriages which form part of customary law marriages
              are also legally binding where celebrated in accordance with
              the native law and custom of the particular community.


              'If proxy marriages are legal, what process is followed in
           order to obtain legal
              recognition of the marriage?


              One of the functions of local governments in Nigeria is to
              register all marriages. This is provided for in the Fourth
              Schedule to the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of
              Nigeria. As a result, some local governments have bye-laws
              for the registration of customary law marriages... Some of
              these bye-laws make registration of customary law marriages
              compulsory and prescribe a penalty for failure to register
              such marriage. In addition to the foregoing, the Birth,
              Deaths etc (Compulsory Registration) Act Cap.B9, Laws of the
              Federation of Nigeria, 2004 (the -Act|) also stipulates that
              a customary law marriage be registered within a specific
              period after its celebration. Specifically, section 30 of the
              Act provides as follows:


                  "Notwithstanding anything contained in any enactment
                  every customary marriage is to be registered within sixty
                  (60) days in the area court or customary court where the
                  marriage was contracted.
                  The foregoing provision of the Act presupposes the
                  statutory and therefore legal recognition of customary
                  law marriages. The Honorary Legal Adviser is therefore of
                  the opinion that so called proxy marriages, as an aspect
                  of customary law marriage, are legal; and legal
                  recognition is conferred by registration in an area or
                  customary court.' "

 9. The US State  Department  Reciprocity  Schedule  maintains  that  proxy
    marriage is not valid in Nigeria and that the parties to  the  marriage
    have to be present. The second,  slightly  more  recent  source,  is  a
    letter from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to the UK  Border
    Agency of 1 February 2013. In my view the FCO letter is  more  detailed
    and the source of information clearly indicated. I prefer it for  those
    reasons and find that a proxy customary marriage  is  recognised  under
    Nigerian law and thus can be recognised in the UK.

10. I should stress that I make this  finding  on  the  evidence  that  was
    before me and that I am conscious that  a  reported  decision  on  this
    matter is awaited from a Vice-Presidential panel of the Upper Tribunal.
    It is very likely that the panel will have substantially more  evidence
    on this point and more  detailed  legal  submissions.  My  decision  is
    limited to this appeal alone, therefore, and other judges in  both  the
    First-tier Tribunal  and Upper Tribunal will reach their  own  decision
    if required to do so before the reported case is published.

11. It was not my view that even if the  appellant  had  shown  a  Nigerian
    proxy customary marriage is valid that he  had  shown  that  his  proxy
    customary marriage was validly conducted.

12. The head note to NA (Customary marriage and divorce -  evidence)  Ghana
    [2009] UKAIT 00009 states:

        "The onus of proving either a  customary  marriage  or  dissolution
        rests on the party making the assertion. It  is  normally  for  the
        appellant to prove that a marriage is valid.  Where  this  involves
        proving that a previous customary marriage has been  dissolved,  it
        is reasonable to expect the appellant to produce the best available
        evidence to support this assertion."

13. NA indicates that good evidence is needed  to  show  that  a  customary
    marriage has been dissolved. It appeared to me that the same  principle
    must apply to showing that a valid proxy customary marriage  had  taken
    place.

14. The evidence relied on by the appellant does not  set  out  the  Yoruba
    customs that were followed or indicate that any of those  details  were
    confirmed to the Customary Court such that  the  authorities  would  be
    prepared to issue a certificate of  registration  of  the  marriage  or
    affidavit  confirming  that  the  marriage  had  been  contracted.  The
    documents suggest that the appellant's mother  acted  for  him  in  the
    proceedings in Nigeria but there is nothing to show who was  authorised
    to act as a proxy for the French sponsor or how or when that  authority
    was given. The appellant's witness statement  at  [8]  states  that  an
    affidavit from the sponsor's parents was required for a proxy customary
    marriage to proceed but such an affidavit  from  them  has  never  been
    produced.

15. The grounds of appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  maintain  that  original
    certificate of registration and original affidavit sworn by the officer
    of the customary court were before the First-tier Tribunal.  They  were
    not. Only copies were provided. I found that less weight had to  accrue
    to any of the documents  relied  upon  where  the  appellant  could  be
    expected to provide originals. The marriage documents all arose from  a
    ceremony in February 2012 and there was no coherent explanation  as  to
    why all of the originals could not  have  been  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and, certainly, before me.

16. I was  provided with an original laminated copy of a receipt of payment
    of the bride price. There was no copy of this document before the First-
    tier Tribunal. There was nothing official about it  by  way  of  headed
    paper, official headings or stamps. It could have been produced on  any
    word processor.

17. I was also provided with an original copy of the affidavit from the Oyo
    Customary Court. The original was not before the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    Section 31 of the current COIR on Nigeria (and the reports I  consulted
    going back to April 2011) evidenced extensively the endemic  corruption
    and widespread availability of forged official  documents  in  Nigeria.
    Having considered the documents provided by the appellant  relating  to
    the proxy customary marriage that he maintains took place in Nigeria in
    the round, I found that little weight could be place on  them;  Tanveer
    Ahmed* [2002] UKIAT 00439 applies.

18. There were other matters that  indicated  to  me  that  even  if  proxy
    customary marriage is recognised in Nigeria and falls to be  considered
    as valid in the UK, this particular marriage was  one  of  convenience.
    The appellant and sponsor failed to attend two interviews  arranged  by
    the respondent to obtain further information about the application. The
    appellant and sponsor addressed the failure to attend the interviews in
    their witness  statements.  Their  explanations  are   assertion  only,
    however, with no documentary evidence to  confirm  that  the  sponsor's
    mother was unwell in November 2012. There was nothing to confirm  their
    evidence that the sponsor returned to work only on 3 December 2012  and
    was refused a day off on 5 December  2012  for  the  second  interview.
    There was nothing to support the evidence that the appellant's wife was
    sacked shortly afterwards because of  an  argument  about  whether  she
    could attend the interview on 5 December 2012. The  payments  into  her
    bank account that appear to be from another employer cannot confirm the
    events she claims  led  to  her  failing  to  attend  two  Home  Office
    interviews. Having stated at [13] of his witness statement that he  was
    willing to attend an interview alone, the appellant  does  not  explain
    why he did not attend the second interview even if his wife could  not.
    I did not find that these explanations were credible and the failure to
    attend  two  interviews  to  have  the  marriage  investigated  by  the
    respondent undermines the assertions of the appellant and sponsor  that
    the marriage was genuine and not one of convenience.

19. The letter dated 15 April  2012  from  the  sponsor's  employer  raises
    further credibility problems for the appellant and sponsor. In addition
    to a number of grammatical and punctuation errors, the  letter  clearly
    states that the sponsor was working as a  catering  assistant.  In  her
    witness statement at [3] she states that "I have  always  worked  as  a
    care staff and also as a self-employed hair dresser and wedding make-up
    artist (my emphasis)", none of which occupations comes close to being a
    care worker. The same inconsistency arises at  [14]  and  [15]  of  the
    appellant's  witness  statement.  This  somewhat  stark   inconsistency
    strongly indicated to me that the appellant and sponsor were not at all
    reliable witnesses and that all of their documentary evidence  must  be
    regarded with some circumspection.

20. Other aspects  of  the  appellant's  case  additionally  undermine  his
    credibility and that of the sponsor. The appellant  maintains  that  he
    could not return to Nigeria to get married. He  states  that  this  was
    because the respondent had his passport. There was nothing  to  prevent
    him obtaining his passport and returning to Nigeria with the sponsor to
    get married there, or going to France as  a  fianc�e  to  marry  there,
    however. The couple maintain that they could not pay a lawyer  to  come
    to an oral hearing but that did not prevent them attending in person to
    confirm their evidence.

21. The evidence of bank statements and utility bills in the names  of  the
    appellant and sponsor sent to the same address is limited  and  is  not
    sufficient to show that the relationship is genuine. The photographs of
    what was said to be a marriage ceremony could have been taken  anywhere
    or at any marriage ceremony. The photographs of the  portraits  of  the
    appellant and sponsor placed together are shown in separate photographs
    and not so as to confirm that they were in the room where the purported
    ceremony is taking place. These photographs would have  been  available
    since February 2012. It was not clear to me why they  were  not  before
    the First-tier Tribunal. Deciding to have a  paper  appeal  was  not  a
    matter that in any way precluded evidence available from February  2012
    being submitted for an appeal lodged in January 2013.

22. All of these matters indicated to me that the respondent was correct to
    submit that the marriage was  one  of  convenience  in  line  with  the
    guidance set out in Papajorgji (EEA spouse - marriage  of  convenience)
    Greece [2012] UKUT 00038(IAC) and that, considering all of the evidence
    in the round, the appellant had not met the concerns raised above.

23. In short, even if a Nigerian proxy customary marriage can  be  accepted
    as valid by the  authorities  in  the  UK,  this  marriage  is  one  of
    convenience and the appeal must fail.

Decision

24. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error on a point of
    law and is set aside. I re-make the appeal as refused.
