For the Respondent:    Miss Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal from the determination of the First-tier Tribunal  of
    11 May 2015 which dismissed the appeals of the principal appellant  and
    his wife and two children who have linked appeals.  We shall  refer  to
    the principal appellant as the appellant.

2.   By a decision letter dated 27 March 2014  the  respondent  refused  the
    appellant and his family leave to remain in the United Kingdom as  Tier
    1 (General) Migrants and directions were given for their removal.

3.   The reasons given were,  first,  that  he  had  failed  to  disclose  a
    material fact, namely a previous police caution when completing Section
    E1 of the application form and, secondly, that the  appellant  had  not
    provided sufficient evidence to satisfy the requirements of Appendix  A
    of the Immigration Rules.   The  respondent  was  not  satisfied  as  a
    consequence that he qualified for an award of the required  40  points.
    A decision had been made not to  request  additional  documentation  or
    exceptionally to consider  the  application  under  the  provisions  of
    paragraph 245AA.  In the documentation the appellant did provide he had
    claimed a total  of  �37,384.74  for  a  previous  earnings  comprising
    �6,587.75 from his employment with the Saga Group  and  �30,796.99  net
    profit from his self-employment.  While he had provided a letter from a
    firm  of  accountants  named  Akarams  &  Co  together   with   certain
    documentation, the respondent was not satisfied that  he  had  provided
    sufficient evidence  to  corroborate  his  self  employed  earnings  as
    specified in Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.

4.   In the reasons for refusal attached to the notice of appeal  there  was
    also contained a further reason as follows: "Your  accountant  is  also
    not regulated by any of the recognised regulated bodies,  therefore  we
    are unable to accept the documents supplied by them."   Appendix  A  of
    the rules required this matter to be certified.  For some  reason  that
    remains  unexplained,  the  letter  of   refusal   contained   in   the
    respondent's bundle did not contain that reason for refusal.

5.   The appellant appealed to the Tribunal.  Because the ground of  refusal
    relating to the status of the appellant's accountant did not appear  in
    the copy of the refusal letter contained in  the  respondent's  bundle,
    the appellant  did  not  produce  any  documentation  to  the  Tribunal
    demonstrating that the accountants who had  provided  information  were
    regulated in terms of Appendix A.  It was submitted that the respondent
    had, in effect, conceded that the accountant's  regulatory  status  was
    not being questioned in the appeal.

7.   It was submitted on behalf of  the  appellant  that  the  documentation
    provided by the  accountant  satisfied  in  full  the  requirements  of
    Appendix A both in respect of his employed earnings  and  his  earnings
    from self employment.

8.   In relation to the matter of the accountant's  regulatory  status,  the
    Tribunal viewed that reason of refusal as an operative one.  There  was
    no evidence before it that the appellant's accountants were members  of
    a regulated organisation.  The Tribunal also found that the  statements
    from the accountants did not appear to be detailed enough  as  required
    by Appendix A.  The Tribunal accepted  that  the  non-disclosure  of  a
    police caution was not required by the rules.  The  Tribunal  dismissed
    the appellants' appeal and the linked appeals of his family.

9.   The appellant appealed against that decision  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    Mr Ijezie appeared before us on behalf of the  appellants.   He  argued
    that there was a material  procedural  error  in  respect  of  the  two
    differing versions of the letter of refusal  of  leave  which  violated
    Rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) Immigration and
    Asylum Chamber Rules 2014.   The process was procedurally unfair  since
    the appellant had been misled into believing that one  of  the  reasons
    for refusal had been abandoned. The appellant  legitimately  understood
    that it was  not  necessary  for  him  to  provide  evidence  that  his
    accountant was properly regulated as required by Appendix A.

10.  Mr Ijezie did not contend that the Secretary of  State  ought  to  have
    exercised any discretion under paragraph 245AA of the Rules.

11.  Since the date of the First-tier  Tribunal's  determination,  a  letter
    from his accountants dated 4 December  2014  has  been  produced  which
    purports to state that the firm is  "of  Association  Certified  Public
    Accountants of Great Britain" (sic) and the author of the letter  is  a
    fellow member of "the board of Association Certified Public Accounts of
    Great Britain".  This was the letter which would have been produced  to
    the First-tier Tribunal had the appellant thought that the  matter  was
    being contested by the respondent.

13.  Paragraph 19G of Appendix A of the rules  provides  that,  if  earnings
    are for work done while in the UK, the evidence which  is  required  in
    relation  to  previous  earnings  must  come  from  an  accountant   or
    accountancy firm in the UK who is a  member  of  one  of  eight  listed
    recognised supervisory bodies.  Mr Ijezie accepted before this Tribunal
    that Akarams &  Company  was  not  a  member  of  any  such  recognised
    supervisory body.

14.  In that event, even if the appellant had not been misled as  he  claims
    to have been, and had provided the letter now  tendered,  the  Tribunal
    could not have found that the accountants were a member of a recognised
    supervisory body as required by that rule in Appendix A. Indeed had the
    letter been produced by the appellant before the Tribunal, it would not
    have been admissible (pursuant to section 85A of the 2002 Act)  because
    it was not submitted with the application.

15.  Accordingly, it cannot be said that there was  any  material  error  of
    law in the way that the Tribunal approached the  matter.   On  no  view
    could the appellant have satisfied the  terms  of  the  rules  and  the
    Tribunal's decision is one that cannot be impugned.  The requirement of
    the rules is of importance since  the  provenance  and  reliability  of
    accounts  and  other  information  from  professional  bodies  such  as
    accountants requires to be instantly verifiable.

16.  For these reasons we will refuse the appeal.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.
