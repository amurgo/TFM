Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Lay, Counsel instructed by Syed Shaheen
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms S Cunha, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This appeal comes back before me following a hearing on  12  June  2018
    before me and Yip J following which we concluded that the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT") was marred by error of law such  as  to
    require its decision to be set aside and for the decision to be re-made
    in the Upper Tribunal.  The hearing before me was for the re-making  of
    the decision.

 2. The decision ('the error of law decision') which gives our reasons  for
    setting aside the FtT's decision is included as an annex, and reference
    to it should be made for the further background to the appeal.

 3. To introduce this, the re-making of the decision, I repeat the  details
    of the opening paragraphs of the error of law decision.   Thus,  on  12
    September 2017 the respondent refused the  appellant's  protection  and
    human rights claim within her decision  to  make  a  deportation  order
    against the appellant.  That deportation order followed his convictions
    for conspiracy to supply Class A and B drugs for which  he  received  a
    total sentence of 27 months' imprisonment.

 4. The appellant had arrived illegally in the UK from Afghanistan  in  May
    2006.  He made a claim for asylum which was refused, but in  the  light
    of the fact that he was aged 16 years  at  the  time,  he  was  granted
    discretionary leave until 31 January  2008.   That  leave  was  further
    extended.

 5. At the hearing before me the 22 page bundle that was before the FtT was
    relied on.  There was  a  further  bundle  containing  some  duplicated
    material but with further witness statements of the appellant  and  his
    partner, a psychiatric report from a Dr Fazel dated 13 January 2019 and
    various country background documents, including the UNHCR Guidelines in
    relation to asylum seekers from Afghanistan.  There was also an extract
    from the appellant's prison records.

 6. Mr Lay relied on his earlier  skeleton  argument  dated  12  June  2018
    insofar as the arguments advanced in it have not been superseded by the
    conclusions set out in the error of law decision.

 7. It was accepted that the appellant could not rely on  paragraph  399(b)
    as regards his relationship with his partner because of the requirement
    in para 399(b)(i) that their relationship was not formed at a time when
    his immigration status was precarious, and bearing in mind the decision
    of the Supreme Court in Rhuppiah v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department  [2018]  UKSC  58.   However,  it  was  submitted  that  the
    appellant could rely on the 'very compelling  circumstances'  provision
    of para 398(c) taking into account the aspects of para 399(b)  that  do
    apply in his favour.

 8. The appellant and his partner gave evidence.  I set out  a  summary  of
    their evidence in the following paragraphs.

    The oral evidence

 9. The appellant adopted his witness statements  in  examination-in-chief.
    He said that he had heard from a man in  their  village  of  Shakardara
    that his parents had been killed in Afghanistan.   He  said  that  they
    were going to a wedding and they were killed by an airstrike.   He  was
    told that that was  about  six  months  before  2014.   Since  he  left
    Afghanistan he has had no contact with his sister there and no news  of
    her.  He has no brothers.

10. He is still in a relationship with his partner  Asma.   They  performed
    the nikah Islamic ceremony on 1 January 2019.  Her parents were present
    but they are still not happy about the relationship.

11. In cross-examination he said that he has not kept in contact  with  the
    person who told him about his parents.  He had seen him twice.   As  to
    how he knows that what he was told is true, that  person  is  from  his
    area and knew his parents.  He went to his house near Stratford but  he
    had not seen him since then.  He is the only  person  from  Afghanistan
    who he has been in contact with.

12. He only speaks Pashtu, but does not read it.  He does not speak or read
    Dari.   He  agreed  that  Pashtu  is  one  of  the  main  languages  in
    Afghanistan.

13. He had never  been  to  Kabul.   There  are  no  jobs  and  nothing  in
    Afghanistan.  Whilst he was there he was just helping his father in the
    fields but otherwise he could not get a job.  He was aged 13 or 14 when
    he left.  He would not be able to get a job even though now  an  adult.
    He has not spoken to his younger sister since he left and he  does  not
    know where she is.  The friend does not know either.

14. He does not live with Asma, but still lives at his friend's house.  She
    lives with her parents.

15. Referred to para 3.7 of Dr Fazel's psychiatric report, he  agreed  that
    he had been advised to attend a mental health centre but did not do so.
     He was also advised to go to see a doctor  and  was  prescribed  anti-
    depressants but he did not take them.  He did take them whilst  he  was
    in prison but not since his release.

16. In re-examination he said that in the first place he  had  no  identity
    documents to go and see a GP and felt so  low  that  he  could  not  go
    there.  He lost a lot of weight.  He was also scared to go to  the  GP.
    The tablets he had been taking whilst in prison made  him  feel  worse.
    The medication was Olanzapine, although Mirtazapine used to  help.   He
    then said that Mirtazapine makes him feel worse, although when he takes
    it without Olanzapine he feels okay.  He had told the psychiatrist that
    he had been unable to register with a GP.

17. In answer to my questions he said that the name of his friend (who told
    him about his parents) is Karim.  That is the only name  he  knows  him
    by.   He  does  not  know  his  immigration  status.   He  works  as  a
    construction worker.

18. 'Asma' adopted her witness  statements  in  examination-in-chief.   She
    said that on 1 January 2019 they had a family get together with an imam
    and they performed the nikah.  It was so that his family could  get  to
    know the appellant.  Her family  is  still  a  bit  worried  about  the
    relationship but that is changing a bit.

19. She still works as a primary schoolteacher earning roughly  �2,100  per
    month.  At the end of the month she is left with about �200 or �300.

20.  If  the  appellant  had  to  return  to  Afghanistan  she  would  only
    realistically be able to send him about �50 per month.  She would still
    be concerned about him even if she was sending him money because he has
    no family there and no job.  She would be worried about  his  emotional
    wellbeing.  He is prone to self-harm and suicidal thoughts.  He has  no
    family, friends or relatives.  That would worry her a lot.   All  those
    things add up.

21. She had read the psychiatric report.  She found  out  about  his  self-
    harming when he was in prison.  She also found out about his  low  mood
    and his crying uncontrollably.  That has now increased.   Sometimes  he
    will suddenly cry for no reason and would constantly  shake  his  head.
    She feels that his appetite has gone down.  Even now if he has  just  a
    coffee he would not finish it.  He does not seem to finish anything (to
    eat or drink).  His mood changes all the time.  He is worse  now  since
    he has been in prison, although she also had concerns before he went to
    prison.

22. She had suggested that he goes to a doctor but he is very reluctant  to
    do so.  He does not like doctors because he is scared that  they  would
    lock him away.  She  had  tried  to  suggest  it  to  him  many  times.
    However, because he now has psychiatric  evidence,  that  may  help  to
    persuade him to  go  to  the  doctor  because  it  comes  from  someone
    professional.  It is someone else saying it.

23. In cross-examination she  said  that  the  issue  in  relation  to  his
    appetite is not  just  because  of  uncertainty  over  his  immigration
    status.  It was at a low level  before.   He  did  tell  her  what  had
    happened in prison.

24. She has been with him for nine years.  He has never had a full-time  or
    proper job.  After he came out of prison she supported him.  She  would
    not say that she is 'happy' to provide him with  about  �50  per  month
    routinely, because she has other responsibilities.

25. She referred to "certain protocols" in relation to whether she was able
    to bring a man home.  She is from Pakistan and was not born in  the  UK
    although she is a British citizen.  She does not speak Pashtu.

26. Her family know about his time in prison and they  do  have  difficulty
    accepting him.  Their backgrounds are different.  Her parents are  both
    from Pakistan.

27. She spoke to him when he was in prison whenever  he  called  her.   She
    visited him every week.  Their relationship could not continue over the
    phone if he went to Afghanistan.  They are planning  to  live  together
    regardless of her family not accepting him.

28. In answer to my questions she said that they would be allowed  to  live
    together after having performed the nikah.  As to why they do not,  she
    said that first they need to get a place.  He is still not able to stay
    at her place because her parents do not want him  to  as  a  result  of
    their cultural differences.  There are also many other reasons  so  she
    would want to get their own place.

29. To her knowledge he does not have family in Afghanistan.  She does  not
    think he has his parents because he told her that they had died and she
    believes him.

30. In further cross-examination she said that she had to ask  her  parents
    to be allowed to  go  through  the  nikah  but  they  were  not  happy.
    However, at the end of the day it was her choice.

31. As to why then she is not living with him, she said that it takes  time
    to get a place.  She works full-time and it is hard to  find  a  place.
    The procedure is long and most estate  agents  are  shut  on  Saturdays
    which is the only day she has.  It is just a question  of  getting  the
    time.  She clarified that  most  estate  agent's  appointments  are  on
    Saturdays but often they cancel.

32. She wants the Home Office to understand the situation and  look  beyond
    his convictions.  If he goes to Afghanistan she would be  left  behind.
    She relies on him for emotional support and she would be  punished  for
    something that she did not do.   People  should  be  allowed  a  second
    opportunity.  He has made a mistake and has been punished.   That  does
    not mean he should be punished for the rest of his life,  or  that  she
    should.  What would she do if he  was  deported?   She  would  probably
    never have her own family and so what would be  the  point  of  living?
    Everything she does she does for him.  She went into teaching  for  him
    and to break that bond would be unfair on both of them.

    Submissions

33. Ms Cunha relied on the respondent's decision letter.  Although the pre-
    sentence report refers to the risk of reoffending  being  low  and  the
    appellant has not committed further offences, he has nevertheless  been
    on strict licence conditions including not accessing the area where the
    offences were committed.

34. The sentencing remarks show that the  appellant  played  a  significant
    role in the offences.  He has  two  previous  cautions  for  possessing
    controlled drugs and for an offence of battery.  He had previously been
    warned and had disregarded those warnings.  Despite what is in the pre-
    sentence report he could pose a risk to the community if he  is  unable
    to find a job and has financial needs.  It was submitted  that  he  had
    not rebutted the presumption of being a danger to the community.

35. As to risk  on  return,  Ms  Cunha  relied  on  AS  (Safety  of  Kabul)
    Afghanistan CG [2018] UKUT 00118 (IAC).  The events that the  appellant
    describes as having happened to him when he was in Afghanistan occurred
    when he was aged 13 or 14.  He is now 27.  He was  in  any  event  only
    assisting the Taliban with  food.   He  was  never  in  a  high-profile
    position.  There would be no real risk  of  persecution  on  return  to
    Kabul.  Both the Country of Origin  Information  Report  and  the  EASO
    report  indicate  that  there  is  rehabilitation  available  for  drug
    addicts.

36. In relation to article 3 of the ECHR, Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department v Said [2016] EWCA Civ 442, in particular at  [31],  decided
    that poverty and destitution are not sufficient to reveal a  breach  of
    article 3.

37. So far as article 8 is concerned and undue harshness under para 399, it
    was accepted that it would be unduly harsh for the appellant's  partner
    to go to Afghanistan.  However, she could remain in the UK.

38. It is clear from KO  (Nigeria)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2018] UKSC 53, in particular at [23]  that  'unduly  harsh'
    means more than just harsh.  The fact is that  the  appellant  and  his
    partner do not even live together.  Likewise, in relation to s. 117  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act"),  the
    appellant could return to Afghanistan and obtain  employment.   He  was
    able to obtain work in the UK through friends  who,  according  to  his
    evidence, were not even  nationals  of  Afghanistan.   He  also  has  a
    contact from Afghanistan who lives in Stratford.

39. The psychiatric report does not say that he  is  completely  unable  to
    cope, and he has managed before.  He came to the UK where  he  did  not
    know the country or the language.  He was able to draw on  the  support
    of his partner.  She says that she would be able to  provide  him  with
    about �50 per month should he have  to  return  to  Afghanistan.   That
    would go further than it would in the UK.  He would also have access to
    about �750 from the Secretary of State.  That would assist initially.

40. In relation to his mental health, he had chosen not to  seek  treatment
    so the situation would  be  no  different  if  he  were  to  return  to
    Afghanistan.  There are in any event pharmacies there and he would have
    access to medication.  The appellant's partner has  not  been  able  to
    exercise any influence over him in the nine years that they  have  been
    together.  She could not stop him  taking  drugs  or  selling  them  to
    innocent people.  She was  unable  to  persuade  him  to  seek  medical
    attention.

41. There was a clear public interest in his deportation and there were  no
    very significant obstacles to his integration.  He had  lived  most  of
    his life in Afghanistan and was familiar with the language and culture.
     There were no compelling circumstances.

42. In his submissions Mr Lay argued that the appellant does not  represent
    a danger to the community and thus the presumptions in  s.  72  of  the
    2002 Act are rebutted.  It was accepted that the previous offences were
    serious but not that he represents a danger to the community.   He  had
    been bailed since October 2017 and had not committed further  offences.



43. As regards asylum, the appellant had been subjected to recruitment  and
    harm as a child, as set out in his witness statement.  He was  held  in
    solitary confinement and beaten.  That was near Shakardara in  Northern
    Kabul province.  Therefore, para 339K  of  the  Rules  applies.   Rural
    areas in the north of Kabul province are still contested.  Mr Lay  made
    it clear that he was not suggesting  that  the  Taliban  actually  hold
    Shakardara but as  is  clear  from  the  background  reports,  adjacent
    districts to the east and west are subject to a  Taliban  presence  and
    infiltration.   There  is  no  direct  evidence  of  the  situation  in
    Shakardara in that context, but it is reasonable to conclude  that  the
    Taliban are still in his home district.

44. His evidence is that his parents have died.  I was  invited  to  accept
    that evidence.  It was accepted that there was no article 15(c) risk in
    the north of Kabul province.  Further, it  was  accepted  that  in  the
    light of current country guidance, it could not be said that there  was
    a risk of persecution in the city of Kabul.

45. Although it was not accepted that AS  (Afghanistan)  was  correct,  the
    appellant could not in any event relocate to Kabul  city,  consistently
    with AS (Afghanistan).  I was referred to [230] of  that  decision  and
    the factors to be taken into account.  The appellant  left  Afghanistan
    when he was 14 and is now aged 28.  He has no support network there and
    his mental health is a factor to be taken into account, as set  out  in
    the psychiatric report.  There was compelling evidence from his partner
    in terms of his ability to cope.

46. The prison record refers to the acts of self-harm.  Even if his  mental
    health conditions are related  to  the  murder  that  he  witnessed  in
    prison, that is not necessarily  relevant.   It  does  not  weaken  the
    argument in terms of his circumstances on return with reference to  his
    mental health.

47. As to what was said about the returns package, there was no evidence of
    that put before me, it was submitted.  It is  not  referred  to  in  AS
    (Afghanistan)  either.   The  respondent's  decision  letter  does  not
    mention it.  In any event such financial assistance would not provide a
    long-term solution.

48. AS (Afghanistan) looks at the 2016 UNHCR guidelines.  However, the 2018
    UNHCR guidelines are significant.

49. The decision in Said does not affect the assessment  of  article  3  in
    this case.  Furthermore, the situation in Kabul  is  connected  to  the
    civil conflict.  Mr Lay described Kabul  as  "an  island  of  surviving
    national government in a sea of insecurity".

50. It was however accepted that if it was reasonable for the appellant  to
    relocate to Kabul, there would be no article 3 risk.   If  it  was  not
    reasonable for him to relocate there, the issue of article 3  does  not
    arise.

51. As to article 8, the decision in KO (Nigeria) was  not  concerned  with
    relationships between partners.  It was accepted that in any event even
    if the appellant was able to establish that  his  separation  from  his
    partner would be unduly harsh with reference to para 399(b) that  would
    not mean necessarily that his appeal would succeed under article 8  and
    having regard to s. 117C of the  2002  Act.   Similarly,  even  if  the
    decision was only 'harsh' that  could  still  come  within  article  8.
    There  are  preserved  findings  in  terms  of  the  length  of   their
    relationship.  The issue of cohabitation is not  particularly  relevant
    given the cultural issues evident in this  case.   For  them,  that  is
    their only relationship.  The appellant's partner is committed to  him.



52. It was also relevant that the appellant had  had  a  decade  of  lawful
    leave, until 2018.  He came to the UK as a child.  He suffered harm  in
    Afghanistan.

53. Furthermore, if he returned she could not even visit him.  It would  be
    less  harsh  if  she  could  visit  but  she  could  not.    All   that
    "accumulates" into a situation of despair for her.  Furthermore,  there
    are the additional factors which have been referred to.  There are very
    compelling circumstances, including the low risk of reoffending.

54. It was confirmed that there was no argument advanced in relation to the
    risk of suicide and article 3 in that respect.

    Assessment and Conclusions

55. At [67] of the error of law decision a provisional view  was  expressed
    as to what findings of fact made by the FtT could be preserved.   There
    we said as follows:

         "Our initial view, subject to the submissions of  the  parties,  is
         that the findings that the appellant  and  his  partner  are  in  a
         genuine relationship, that it would be unduly harsh to  expect  his
         partner to return to Afghanistan with him, and the finding that the
         appellant has given a credible account  of  events  in  Afghanistan
         prior to his leaving, are the only findings that can be preserved."

56. The parties did  not  dissent  from  the  suggestion  as  to  preserved
    findings.  Thus, the preserved findings are that:

       . The appellant has given a credible account of events in Afghanistan
         prior to his leaving.

       . The appellant and his partner are in a genuine relationship.

       . It would be unduly harsh  to  expect  the  appellant's  partner  to
         return to Afghanistan with him.

57. The appellant's account of events in Afghanistan, and  as  accepted  by
    the FtT, is to be found in the  witness  statement  prepared  for  that
    hearing.  There he states that he was seized by the Taliban to fight as
    a child soldier, there having been forced conscription of young men  in
    the area where he lived.  One of his cousins was killed whilst fighting
    for the Taliban.  The  appellant  ignored  the  order  of  conscription
    because he was the only able-bodied member of the  family,  his  father
    being disabled and his mother had cancer.  His younger sister was  very
    young at the time.

58. The Taliban came searching for people who ignored the order.  They came
    to his house but he managed to escape.  He spent some  time  hiding  in
    the hills but was eventually captured.  He was taken to a  place  where
    there were many other prisoners and was questioned.   He  continued  to
    refuse to fight and was forced to cook and clean for them, stating that
    "it was like slavery".  He was  put  in  solitary  confinement  in  the
    basement of the house for five months.   He  was  unable  to  stand  up
    properly because of the low ceiling.  He slept on a  plastic  sheet  on
    the floor.  He was let out only to go to the toilet which was a hole in
    the ground nearby.

59. During that five month period  of  detention  he  was  beaten  on  many
    occasions, sometimes with the use of a  rubber  belt.   He  was  beaten
    about two or three times a week.  He was tied to a chair and they would
    beat him on the soles of his feet, demanding  that  he  fight  for  the
    Taliban.

60. Eventually local villagers fought with the Taliban because of the young
    men and boys being detained.  During the fighting some of  the  Taliban
    and the villagers were killed and some of the prisoners  too.   He  was
    rescued by the villagers and left the country with the assistance of an
    agent.

61. Mr Lay, understandably, relies on para 339K of the Rules.  That  states
    as follows:

         "The fact that a person has already been subject to persecution  or
         serious harm, or to direct threats  of  such  persecution  or  such
         harm, will be regarded as a serious indication of the person's well-
         founded fear of persecution or real risk of suffering serious harm,
         unless there are good reasons to consider that such persecution  or
         serious harm will not be repeated."

62. S. 72 of the 2002 Act, so far as material, provides that:

         "(2) A person shall be presumed to have been convicted by  a  final
         judgment of a particularly serious crime and to constitute a danger
         to the community of the United Kingdom if he is-

         (a) convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence, and

         (b) sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least two years.

         ...

         (6) A presumption under subsection (2)...that a person  constitutes
         a danger to the community is rebuttable by that person."

63.  The  presumptions,  that  the  appellant  has  been  convicted  of   a
    particularly serious crime and that he  constitutes  a  danger  to  the
    community of  the  United  Kingdom,  are  thus  presumptions  that  are
    rebuttable by the appellant.  It was not disputed on his behalf that he
    has been convicted of a particularly serious crime, and plainly that is
    a realistic position to take on his behalf.  However, it is argued that
    he has rebutted the presumption that he constitutes  a  danger  to  the
    community of the United Kingdom.

64. The probation officer's report dated 6 February 2018 confirms that  the
    appellant had, as at that date, been complying with  his  licence.   It
    refers to his having been assessed by the Probation Service "as  a  low
    risk of serious harm and a low risk of re-offending".

65. The pre-sentence report refers to the circumstances of the  appellant's
    involvement in the offences of conspiracy  to  supply  Class  A  and  B
    drugs.  It is not necessary for me  to  repeat  what  is  in  the  pre-
    sentence report, except to say that the  appellant's  role  was  as  an
    introducer on behalf of others who  held  and  supplied  the  drugs  in
    question.  This is also reflected in the sentencing remarks.  The  pre-
    sentence report states that "there is  a  34%  chance  of  reconviction
    within  a  two  year  period,  indicating  a  relatively  low  risk  of
    reconviction.  I would concur with this assessment."   It  goes  on  to
    state that he is a low risk of serious harm to the public.

66. It is to be noted that the appellant has two cautions, prior  to  those
    offences, for battery in 2008 and possession of cannabis  in  2015  (as
    revealed in the pre-sentence report).

67. I do note from the pre-sentence report that part of the  assessment  of
    the appellant's low risk of reoffending is that  his  partner  informed
    the author of the report that the appellant would be residing with  her
    and her family once released.  The report's  author  stated  that  that
    would  be  extremely  positive  for  the  appellant  and  reduced   the
    probability of offending, referring to his nine-year relationship  with
    her.  However, as  was  apparent  from  the  evidence  before  me,  the
    appellant did not, and does not, live with  his  partner.   It  is  not
    clear therefore, why the author of the  pre-sentence  report  was  told
    that he would be living with her and her family on his release.  It  is
    reasonable to conclude that the assessment of the risk  of  reoffending
    may have been affected had the author of the report been aware that the
    appellant would not in fact be living with his  partner,  although  the
    fact of the relationship would no doubt  have  still  been  taken  into
    account.

68. Nevertheless, I bear in mind that it is not suggested on behalf of  the
    respondent that the appellant has committed any  further  offences.   I
    was told by Mr Lay that the appellant was  released  in  October  2017.
    Furthermore, I do consider that the professional view of the author  of
    the pre-sentence report needs to be afforded weight  in  terms  of  the
    risk of reoffending, although that view is plainly not determinative.

69. Whilst the appellant is not living with his partner, their relationship
    continues.  His use of  illicit  drugs  which  was  occurring  when  he
    committed these offences, and for some years previously,  according  to
    what he told the author  of  the  psychiatric  report,  Dr  Fazel,  has
    ceased.  The appellant told him that  he  had  stopped  taking  illicit
    drugs whilst in prison and had not  relapsed  since.   The  psychiatric
    report in fact refers to his release on 18  December  2017,  about  two
    months adrift from Mr Lay's understanding of his release date.  The pre-
    sentence report also refers to his having had a problem  with  gambling
    at the time of the offending.

70. I bear in mind that according to the Trial Record Sheet the  period  of
    offending was between 16 March 2016 and 2 September 2016.   The  period
    of offending was therefore of some months' duration.

71. Nevertheless, taking into account all the circumstances, I am satisfied
    that the risk of the appellant reoffending is low, as assessed  by  the
    author of the pre-sentence report.  Events since his  release  and  the
    circumstances overall reveal that to have been a realistic  assessment.



72. However, a low risk of reoffending does not  necessarily  mean  that  a
    person does not constitute a danger to  the  community  of  the  United
    Kingdom.  Offences of supplying drugs would plainly  come  within  that
    category in terms of danger to the community. Nevertheless,  I  do  not
    consider that there is a likelihood that this appellant would revert to
    offences  of  supplying  drugs;  the  risk  of  reoffending   is   low.
    Accordingly, I  am  satisfied  that  the  appellant  has  rebutted  the
    presumption that he constitutes a danger to the community of the United
    Kingdom.   He  is  not  therefore,  excluded  from  Refugee  Convention
    protection.

73. On behalf of the appellant it is submitted that against a background of
    deteriorating  security  in  the  country  as  a  whole,  and   regular
    infiltration into Kabul province, there is a reasonable  likelihood  of
    ongoing risk to the appellant in the area  where  he  is  from,  namely
    Shakardara.  It  is  argued  that  that  district,  in  Northern  Kabul
    province, was historically a Taliban hotbed and is  still  a  strategic
    area on the border with Parwan, while the province more generally still
    has an issue with Taliban infiltration.  In the error of  law  decision
    reference is made at [53] to a New York Times article that  was  relied
    on by the appellant before the FtT,  which  described  the  appellant's
    home area as "historically a  Taliban  hotbed".   The  European  Asylum
    Support Office ("EASO") report dated May  2018  is  relied  on  by  the
    appellant. As summarised in the skeleton  argument  the  report  states
    that:

       . In Surobi district, in Kabul province,  there  is  a  "medium  open
         Taliban presence".

       . In Paghman district to the west of Shakardara, the  security  level
         is assessed as the same.

       . In 2017, in Kabul city itself, suicide and complex  attacks  caused
         1,612 civilian casualties; a 17% increase on 2016;

       . Criminality in  the  form  of  gang-related  violence,  abductions,
         thefts and murder is on the rise in the city of Kabul.

       . Kabul province has received the  highest  number  of  returnees  in
         2017; its capacity to absorb and reintegrate refugees returning, as
         well as IDP's from other provinces, is minimal.

74. I quote the particular passages from the EASO report from  which  those
    summaries are drawn (with footnote references taken out):

         "According to a BBC  study  of  January  2018,  based  on  research
         conducted between 23 August and 21 November 2017, the Taliban  have
         a 'medium active and physical presence' in Surobi, defined as being
         attacked at least three times a month, and 'low'  activity/presence
         (district attacked at least once in three months) in the  districts
         of Paghman, Farza, Qarabagh, Musayi, Khak-e Jabbar and Surobi [page
         25]...

         In a map depicting 'conflict severity' in 2017 - a  combination  of
         three indicators:  security  incidents,  civilian  casualties,  and
         conflict-induced displacement - UNOCHA [United Nations  Office  for
         the Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs]  places  most  of  the
         districts of Kabul province in  the  lowest  two  categories.  Only
         Paghman in the west and Surobi in the east of the province  are  in
         the middle category [page 26]...

         In the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 March 2018,  388  incidents
         related to insurgents in Kabul province were found  in  open  media
         sources by the Global Incidents Map  website.  Surobi  district  is
         depicted by the BBC  as  a  district  with  'medium'  open  Taliban
         presence, defined as being attacked at least three  times  a  month
         [page 27]...

         In 2017,  Kabul  province  accounted  for  the  highest  number  of
         civilian  casualties  in  Afghanistan,  which  is  due  mainly   to
         deliberate attacks in Kabul city; 16 % of all  civilian  casualties
         in Afghanistan occurred  in  Kabul.  Suicide  attacks  and  complex
         attacks, as well as other types of incidents which also include the
         use of IEDs, pushed up the rate of civilian  casualties  in  Kabul.
         One high-profile attack in May 2017 alone accounted for a third  of
         all civilian casualties. UNAMA [United Nations  Assistance  Mission
         in Afghanistan] stated that in 2017, in  Kabul  city,  suicide  and
         complex attacks caused 1 612 civilian casualties (440 deaths and  1
         172 injured), a 17 % increase compared to 2016. In January 2018, at
         least 174 people were killed in attacks in Kabul city  alone  [page
         27] ...

         Criminality in  the  form  of  gang-related  violence,  abductions,
         thefts and murder is on the rise in the city of  Kabul,  with  some
         observers calling the increase in the most recent  months  'sharp'.
         At the end on 2017, the government announced a plan to tackle crime
         by seizing illegal weapons and cars, and in February 2018  declared
         that crime had fallen by 40 % in  the  previous  month  because  of
         their measures. However, residents interviewed by Tolonews disputed
         these claims and stated that the  government  measures  had  little
         effect on the armed groups inside the city, and crime continued  to
         rise [page 32] ...

         In June 2017, UNHCR and the  Norwegian  refugee  Council  made  the
         following assessment:

         'Kabul province has received the highest  number  of  returnees  in
         2017, and historically since  2002.  Its  capacity  to  absorb  and
         reintegrate refugees returning to Afghanistan, as well as IDPs from
         other provinces is minimal. IDPs and returnees are mostly  settling
         in the outskirts of the capital (eg. PD 21, Bagrami, PD 8,  PD  12,
         PD 16) where basic services are lacking'.  In  the  period  from  1
         September 2017 to 26 March 2018, 4 296 individuals  were  displaced
         to Kabul district, primarily from Parwan, Nangarhar and Logar [page
         33]"

75. It was specifically said on behalf of the appellant  that  it  was  not
    suggested that the  Taliban  hold  Shakardara  district,  although  the
    situation in adjacent districts was relied on. As far as  I  am  aware,
    there is in fact no reference at all to Shakardara district in the EASO
    report, and I was not referred to any passage where  it  is  mentioned.
    It was accepted that  there  was  no  actual  direct  evidence  of  the
    situation  in  Shakardara  although  it  was  submitted  that  it   was
    reasonable to conclude that his home district was still a  place  where
    he would be at risk from the Taliban.

76. However, it seems to me that there are certain  difficulties  with  the
    contention that the appellant would be at risk on return  to  his  home
    area.  In the first place, there  is  no  direct  evidence  of  Taliban
    activity in Shakadara district, even accepting the evidence of conflict
    in neighbouring or adjacent areas.

77. Secondly, as was pointed out on behalf of the respondent in submissions
    before me, the appellant was born in January 1990. He left  Afghanistan
    when he was 13 or 14 years of age.  He arrived in the UK in  2006.   He
    was aged 28 years, almost 29, at the date of  the  hearing  before  me.
    The difficulties he had were when he was a child and thus  more  easily
    able to be recruited forcibly, and were events of about 14  years  ago.
    Those are highly relevant factors in terms of the extent to which there
    would now be any risk to him on account of his having refused to  fight
    for the Taliban and having escaped from them, even taking into  account
    the state of his mental health.

78. Whilst the appellant in his witness statement expresses a fear of being
    taken advantage of by the Taliban, and being at risk because he refused
    to fight, I cannot see in the background evidence put before me that it
    is reasonably likely that he would be identified  on  return  or,  more
    importantly, that the Taliban have a presence in the district to  which
    he would be returned. Even if it could be said that the area where  the
    appellant lives is subject to regular Taliban infiltration, which in my
    judgement it could not, the lapse of  time  since  the  appellant  left
    Afghanistan and his age now indicate that it is not  reasonably  likely
    that he would be  at  risk  from  such  infiltrators  as  a  person  of
    individual interest. In those circumstances, I am not satisfied that he
    has established a well-founded fear of persecution in  his  home  area.
    Thus, the issue of internal relocation does not arise.

79. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the appellant has  established  to
    the required standard that he has a well-founded fear of persecution on
    return to Afghanistan.

80. No arguments were put before me in relation to any independent  article
    3/article 15(c) risk in his home area.

81. The evidence given by the appellant to the effect that his parents have
    been killed, as reported to him by a friend or  acquaintance,  was  not
    challenged on behalf of the respondent. Furthermore,  his  evidence  in
    this respect was consistent as between his witness statement  and  oral
    evidence.  Likewise, his partner's evidence supported  that  aspect  of
    his evidence.  I am satisfied that the appellant would not be  able  to
    call on any family support on return to his home area.

82. Nevertheless, he speaks Pashtun and is familiar with  the  customs  and
    culture of Afghanistan, and plainly would  be  familiar  with  his  own
    district, albeit that he left some years ago now.   The  evidence  from
    his partner is that she would be able to send him an amount  of  money,
    in the region of about �50 per month.  Regardless of  any  resettlement
    package provided by the respondent,  the  evidence  indicates  that  he
    would be able to survive on return, at least  to  the  extent  that  he
    would not be destitute, even accepting his mental health problems.

83. In any event,  following  Said  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2016] EWCA Civ 442, a risk of destitution  or  homelessness
    would not establish an article 3 risk.

84. As regards article 8, it is accepted on behalf of the appellant that he
    is not able to bring himself within para 399(b) of the Rules,  for  the
    reasons already explained.

85. It was not argued that he is able to succeed  with  reference  to  para
    399A of the Rules.  Para 399A(a) requires the appellant  to  have  been
    lawfully resident in the UK for most of his life, which he has not.   I
    also doubt that it could be said that there would be  very  significant
    obstacles to his integration into Afghanistan  (para  399A(c))  in  the
    light of the observations above at [82].

86. Thus, under the Rules, the appellant would have to establish that there
    are very compelling circumstances over and  above  those  described  in
    paras 399 and 399A.  It is argued on his behalf that there are.

87. The very compelling circumstances contended for include that  he  would
    be returning to a country where he suffered significant trauma when  he
    was a child.  He has no family support to look to on return there.   He
    would be returning to a  country  which,  on  any  view,  suffers  from
    significant insecurity and instability,  including  in  Kabul  province
    from where he comes.  Furthermore, there is medical  evidence  from  Dr
    Fazel to the effect that  he  has  "symptoms  most  consistent  with  a
    clinical  depression  (of  moderate  severity)"  (para  6.1).   It  was
    concluded at para 6.2, that he does not suffer from PTSD  because  some
    of the symptoms of that disorder were not present.

88. There is evidence that the appellant has attempted  suicide  and  self-
    harmed.  Such is referred to in the psychiatric report at, for example,
    paras 3.6 - 3.7.  There was an attempted suicide in 2014 after he heard
    about his parents' death but a friend stopped  him  from  jumping  from
    London Bridge.   He  also  attempted  suicide  in  prison  by  hanging,
    prompted by his witnessing  the  fatal  stabbing  of  an  inmate.   The
    prisoner profile record states that on 16 May 2017 he made cuts to  his
    left forearm with a razor blade, he having said that voices told him to
    do this.  On 12 May 2017 he was found in his cell with superficial cuts
    to his neck.  As far as I can see however, there  is  no  reference  in
    those records to an attempted suicide by hanging.  Nevertheless, it was
    not disputed on behalf of the respondent that he  does  suffer  from  a
    mental disorder.  There is undoubtedly  evidence  of  deliberate  self-
    harm.

89.  There  is  of  course  the  significant  matter  of  the   appellant's
    relationship  with  his  partner.   I  do  not   consider   that   that
    relationship, its intensity or genuineness, is undermined by  the  fact
    that they do not live together.  This was explained  satisfactorily  by
    the appellant's partner, albeit I remind myself of what she said to the
    author of the pre-sentence report about their living together  once  he
    was released.  It is a preserved finding that they have a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship.  The evidence I heard from both the  appellant
    and his partner reinforced that conclusion.

90. There is merit in what is said on  behalf  of  the  respondent  to  the
    effect that the appellant's partner has had little influence over  him,
    in the sense that she was not able to prevent him  committing  offences
    and she has not been able to prevail upon him to seek medical attention
    in the form of appointments with a GP or accepting medication.

91. It is accepted that if the appellant returns to Afghanistan, she  could
    not be expected to return with him.  She is not from  Afghanistan,  and
    is not familiar with its culture and  customs,  quite  apart  from  the
    conditions of insecurity that prevail there.  There is  also  the  fact
    that her lifestyle would be very different in the sense that she  would
    have to comply with the cultural norms of Afghanistan.  In  any  event,
    as I say, it was not suggested that she could return with him.

92. The outcome of his return to Afghanistan therefore, would be that their
    relationship would end in the  sense  that  they  could  no  longer  be
    together.  As the appellant's  partner  explained,  their  relationship
    would have to end because it could not be a relationship  conducted  by
    phone.

93. The public interest in removing the appellant  is  significant  in  the
    light of  his  convictions,  with  the  seriousness  of  the  offending
    reflected in the sentence imposed.  There is the deterrent effect to be
    taken into account  regardless  of  my  conclusion  that  the  risk  of
    reoffending is low.  The harm that offences of supplying drugs does  is
    all too obvious, and  that  is  reflected  in  the  sentence  that  was
    imposed.

94. However, taking all the circumstances into  account,   I  am  satisfied
    that there are very compelling circumstances over and above  paras  399
    and 399A making it a disproportionate interference with the appellant's
    private and family life for him to return to Afghanistan.  I would also
    conclude,  although  this  is  not  a  necessary  conclusion   in   the
    circumstances, that it would be unduly harsh on the appellant's partner
    for her to be separated from him in circumstances  where,  even  though
    she would be able to send him funds, she would be aware that  he  would
    be vulnerable in Afghanistan because of the security situation, because
    of his vulnerable mental state  and  because  of  his  lack  of  family
    support.

95. I have therefore decided that the appellant meets the  requirements  of
    the article 8 deportation rules, in  that  there  are  very  compelling
    circumstances over and above the requirements of paras  399  and  399A.
    The article 8 Rules in relation to deportation express the Secretary of
    State's view as to how the public interest should be assessed for those
    persons that come within those Rules. In terms of  ss.  117A-C  of  the
    2002  Act  I  would  in  any  event  conclude  that   the   appellant's
    circumstances come  within  s.  117C(5)  in  that  the  effect  of  his
    deportation on his partner would be unduly harsh.

    Decision

96. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law.  Its decision having been set aside, I  re-make  the
    decision by allowing the appeal under article 8.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


 1. The appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of State but it  is
    convenient to continue to refer to the parties as they were before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 2. On 12 September 2017  the  respondent  made  a  decision  to  refuse  a
    protection and human  rights  claim  within  her  decision  to  make  a
    deportation  order  against  the  appellant.   The  deportation   order
    followed his convictions for conspiracy to supply Class A and  B  drugs
    for which he received a total sentence of 27 months' imprisonment.

 3. The appellant arrived in the UK from Afghanistan illegally in May 2006.
     He made a claim for asylum which was refused but in the light  of  the
    fact  that  he  was  aged  16  years  at  the  time,  he  was   granted
    discretionary leave until  31  January  2008  which  was  then  further
    extended

 4. The appellant's appeal against the refusal of his protection and  human
    rights claim came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Andonian ("the FtJ")
    on 16 February 2018.  He allowed the appeal on asylum grounds,  and  on
    human rights grounds with reference to Article 8 of the  ECHR.   It  is
    not clear from his decision as to whether he also allowed the appeal on
    Article 3 grounds.

 5. In order to put the respondent's challenge to the  FtJ's  decision  and
    our assessment of it into context, it is necessary to refer  in  detail
    to the FtJ's decision.

    The FtJ's decision

 6. In his decision the FtJ summarised the basis of the appellant's  claim,
    as itself summarised in the respondent's decision.  The claim  is  that
    he fears mistreatment from the Afghan Government if returned because he
    is of Pashtun origin and is easily identified as such on return.  As  a
    child he was recruited by the Taliban and trained by them to fight.  On
    a date unknown he fled from the Taliban and travelled to  the  UK  aged
    16.  He also fears mistreatment from the Taliban on the basis  that  he
    would be seen as a traitor and that they would  force  him  to  re-join
    them and fight against the  Government.   He  further  claims  to  fear
    mistreatment from the Taliban because he had previously  deserted,  and
    they would kill him as a result.

 7. The FtJ summarised the circumstances of the appellant's offending which
    led to the decision to make a deportation order, including referring in
    detail to the sentencing  judge's  remarks.   Within  the  respondent's
    decision there is consideration  of  section  72  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act")  to  the  effect  that
    because of the appellant's sentence of imprisonment for a period of  at
    least two years, it is  presumed  that  he  has  been  convicted  of  a
    particularly serious crime and constitutes a danger to the community of
    the UK.  The effect of  the  application  of  s.  72  is  that  if  the
    presumptions in it apply, an appeal under the Refugee  Convention  must
    be dismissed.  In relation to s. 72 the FtJ said this at [17]:

         "I was not prepared to uphold the certificate taking  into  account
         the volatile country where the appellant hails from  and  the  area
         where he lived before he came to the UK.  It was important  that  I
         heard full details of his asylum claim."

 8. He referred to AH (Algeria) [2012] EWCA Civ  39  and  at  [61],  having
    referred to the decision in EN (Serbia) v Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 630, he stated that:

         "it seems to me that the appellant can rebut the  presumption  that
         he continues to pose a serious risk.  Having regard to the evidence
         before me I do not believe that he  continues  to  pose  a  serious
         risk".

 9. At [62] he noted evidence indicating that the risk of  reoffending  was
    low, that evidence coming from a letter  from  his  probation  officer.
    Lastly, at [73] he said that he did  not  believe  that  the  appellant
    remained a danger to the community in the United Kingdom.

10. He assessed the appellant's claimed fear of return and the respondent's
    detailed reasons for rejecting the credibility of his  claim.   He  set
    out some background evidence in relation to  Pashtuns  in  Afghanistan,
    and gave a detailed summary of the appellant's oral evidence,  that  of
    his partner AA, and of another witness called on his behalf.

11. He said at [63] that the  appellant  had  maintained  his  account  (of
    events) since his arrival in the UK to the effect that he was targeted,
    kidnapped and tortured by the Taliban.  He said that the  asylum  claim
    had never been subject to a substantive  asylum  interview  nor,  given
    that the appellant was granted discretionary leave,  had  he  been  the
    subject of "fact-finding by first year judge" (sic).

12. He concluded at [65] that the "historic account" is  reasonably  likely
    to be true having regard to the objective evidence and he then referred
    to paragraph 339K of the Immigration Rules in terms of the relevance of
    past persecution.  He found at [66] that the appellant's account  given
    when he was a child was consistent with the activities of  the  Taliban
    in districts outside Kabul  in  the  mid-2000's  as  indicated  in  the
    objective evidence.

13. In relation to a criticism of the appellant in terms of his not  having
    given full details of  his  claim  in  the  screening  interview,  with
    reference to authority he said that  applying  the  lower  standard  of
    proof it was "quite possible" that what the appellant said did in  fact
    occur "and indeed taking into account the situation in  Afghanistan  at
    present".

14. At [69] he referred to the appellant's  home  area  being  Shakar  dara
    district, northern Kabul province which he described as "historically a
    Taliban hotbed" and "now" noted to be a strategic area  on  the  border
    with  Parwan  and  "the  province  still  has  an  issue  with  Taliban
    infiltration".  He referred in the next paragraph to  the  Home  Office
    Country of Origin Information Report ("COI") (undated) at 2.3.9 to  the
    effect that whilst some evidence suggested that the  Taliban  may  have
    the ability to pursue a person, decision-makers must  consider  whether
    they would have the motivation to track and pursue a person  considered
    low profile.  He then found that against a background of  deteriorating
    security in the country as a whole, and regular infiltration into Kabul
    province, there was a reasonable likelihood of risk to the appellant.

15. Rather than summarise what the FtJ said at [72] it is best if we  quote
    that paragraph in full.  He said as follows:

         "Insofar as humanitarian protection is concerned on the basis of an
         article 3 EC HR risk in Kabul return, in any event, it is  my  view
         having regard to the evidence of the appellant,  that  he  faces  a
         real risk of destitution in Kabul a country of which he knows  next
         to nothing about insofar as experience as an  adult  is  concerned.
         He was there as a child.  He is likely to find  himself  living  in
         conditions  of  destitution  with  no  access  to  family   support
         employment or housing.  There is no reason for me to disbelieve the
         fact that he has no family there that he knows of.  However,  I  do
         not believe I need to deal with this aspect of the claim in  detail
         because it is my view that the appellant succeeds in any  event  on
         the  asylum  aspect  of  the  claim  having  regard  to   all   the
         circumstances and on the lower standard of proof incumbent upon him
         to discharge."

    We have set out what the FtJ said at [72] exactly as he wrote it.

16. The FtJ then went on  to  consider  the  contention  that  para  399(b)
    applied in terms of his relationship with his partner AA.  Her evidence
    before him, as summarised at [55], was that she and the appellant  were
    in a stable relationship and had been for the  past  nine  years.   She
    worked as a supply teacher and had done so since 2013, but was now in a
    permanent position.  Her evidence was that they intended to get married
    as soon as possible but they  could  not  at  present  because  of  his
    immigration situation.

17. The appellant's evidence in relation to his relationship  with  AA,  to
    summarise, was to the effect that he maintained a relationship with  AA
    and for a period of about five years  pretended  to  her  that  he  was
    working and  had  accommodation,  whereas  in  fact  he  was  homeless,
    sleeping at the home of friends or at bus shelters.  It  appeared  from
    his evidence that throughout this time he had discussed marriage.   The
    evidence was that the appellant had not  been  to  AA's  home  and  her
    parents did not know anything about him.

18. The FtJ at [75] found the evidence of the appellant and AA credible  as
    to  their  relationship.  Referring  to  what  he  described   as   the
    "exception" under para 399 (presumably a reference to para  399(b))  he
    said that the appellant had discharged the burden of proof upon him  to
    show that he fell within that exception.  He said that  he  could  well
    understand why AA could not go and live in  Afghanistan,  referring  to
    the fact that she has a family and a job in the UK and stating that  it
    would be unsafe for her to go there as a  woman,  and  knowing  nothing
    about Afghanistan.  He concluded that the appellant met para 399(b)  on
    the basis that it  would  be  unduly  harsh  for  her  to  relocate  to
    Afghanistan and it would be unduly harsh for her to remain  in  the  UK
    without the appellant.

19. The FtJ then returned to consideration  of  para  399(b)  at  [78]  and
    summarised the Rules.  At [79] he  said  that  it  would  be  "plainly"
    unduly harsh for AA to attempt to live in Kabul given  present  country
    conditions, and that the respondent  accepted  that  it  would  not  be
    reasonable for her to do so.

20. He then went on to state at [80] that it would also be unduly harsh for
    her  to  remain  in  the  UK  without  the  appellant  "when  all   the
    circumstances are taken  into  account  including  the  length  of  and
    seriousness of the relationship and  the  permanent  rupture  to  which
    deportation would lead".

21. The FtJ's decision then moved to a consideration of what appears to  be
    an assessment of Article 8 outside the Rules.  He  concluded  that  the
    appellant's deportation would be a disproportionate  interference  with
    his and his partner's Article 8  rights  (family  life).   He  said  as
    follows:

         "Even if the appellant were not  to  meet  paragraph  399D  of  the
         rules, insofar as paragraph  398C  is  concerned,  the  deportation
         would in the circumstances  of  this  case  be  a  disproportionate
         interference with the appellant's and his partners article 8 EC  HR
         rights as to family life.  I do believe that the family life exists
         between the appellant and his partner.  I have  further  understood
         the culture, I have understood how they have been  keeping  up  the
         relationship.  It is one of love and  affection.   They  have  been
         together for some  nine  years,  as  detailed  in  the  appellant's
         evidence and  that  of  his  partner  and  in  her  latest  witness
         statement and I have also seen  a  letter  submitted  to  the  Home
         Office in May 2017".

    Again, we have quoted what the FtJ said at [81] as  he  wrote  it.   At
    [82], as written, we find this:

         "The existence or nonexistence of family life for  the  purpose  of
         article article 8 is a question of fact  depending  upon  the  real
         existence in practice of  close  personal  ties,  the  facts  of  a
         particular case crucial.  See the case of Lebbin v the  Netherlands
         2000 for 40 EEA chart 417 at 36.  I think it shows the love of both
         parties towards one another in keeping up the relationship  in  the
         way they have done to date".

22. He concluded at [84] that the appellant and his partner are "close life
    partners".  He found that he needed to look not only  to  present  ties
    but to future plans, referring to certain authorities.   He  stated  at
    [88]  that  the  requirement  of  very  compelling   circumstances   is
    replicated in s. 117C of the 2002 Act.  He then  also  referred  to  s.
    117B of that Act stating that  the  relationship  and  the  appellant's
    private life had been established whilst he had lawful leave.

23. Referring at [90] to MM (Uganda) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2016] EWCA Civ 617, he said that the evaluation  of  unduly
    harsh is a matter of "common sense definition, coloured by context".

24. The FtJ then concluded as follows at [91]:

         "In my view, what pushes the effect of this deportation into unduly
         harsh category is the extreme unlikelihood of the family life  been
         (sic) relocated to Afghanistan in all  the  circumstances  and  the
         impact of permanent separation on the appellant's partner [A]  with
         my view that compelling and emotional evidence was given before  me
         and both parties showed love for one another, and I have also noted
         the impact of  permanent  separation  on  the  appellant's  British
         partner after nine years of the relationship".

25. He then referred  in  the  next  paragraph  to  the  relevance  in  the
    proportionality assessment of the length of time that the appellant had
    been in the UK lawfully and his likely  circumstances  if  deported  to
    Afghanistan.  He referred to Secretary of State for the Home Department
    v Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813 on the issue of integration in the context
    of deportation.

26. Finally, at [93] he concluded by stating that  the  appellant's  lawful
    period of leave, his history and likely prospects in Kabul, the  length
    of time he has spent in the UK as  an  adult,  the  fact  of  having  a
    British partner, the low risk of reoffending and the lack of support in
    Kabul "consistent with the mandatory  public  interest  considerations"
    constituted very compelling circumstances within  para  398(c)  of  the
    Rules (although erroneously referring to that paragraph as para  398C).



    The Grounds and Submissions

27.  In  relation  to  the  asylum  aspect  of  the  FtJ's  assessment  the
    respondent's grounds refer to the COI report that  the  FtJ  quoted  in
    terms of the  Taliban  having  the  ability  to  pursue  a  person  but
    consideration needing to have been given to the motivation to do so  in
    respect of a person with a low profile. The appellant does not claim to
    have a particularly high profile.  Furthermore, although  the  FtJ  had
    said  that  the  appellant  was  at  risk,  against  a  background   of
    deteriorating  security  in  the  country  as  a  whole  and   "regular
    infiltration" into Kabul province, the FtJ did not  elaborate  on  what
    that infiltration was, or by whom, and he did not  appear  to  rely  on
    country information or reports to arrive at that conclusion.   Further,
    the FtJ did not consider internal relocation.

28. The grounds refer (without citation) to AK (Article 15(c))  Afghanistan
    CG [2012] UKUT 163 (IAC)  to the  effect  that  there  are  areas  less
    affected by indiscriminate  violence  (presumably  in  support  of  the
    contention that the appellant could return to one of  those  areas  and
    not be at risk in Kabul).

29. In terms of the s. 72 certificate, it is argued that the  FtJ  was  not
    entitled to take into account where the appellant comes from, and where
    he lived before coming to the UK in relation to whether the certificate
    should  be  upheld.   The  FtJ  had  conflated  consideration  of   the
    certificate with issues in relation to the asylum claim itself. Whether
    or  not  the  appellant  remained  a  danger  to  the   community   was
    irrespective of his country of origin.  It is asserted that that  error
    infected the rest of  the  FtJ's  analysis  regarding  s.  72  and  his
    treatment of the asylum claim as a whole.

30. Further, the FtJ went on to rely on a passage from  AH  (Algeria),  but
    that related to exclusion under Article 1F.

31. It is next asserted that the  FtJ  incorrectly  attributed  significant
    weight to the appellant's rehabilitation, relying on this as  a  factor
    in allowing the appeal.  However, in quoting (again  without  citation)
    from a passage in Danso v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    [2015] EWCA Civ 596, we interpret the grounds as  indicating  that  the
    FtJ's  conclusions  were  inconsistent  with  that  decision  in   that
    rehabilitation of the kind exhibited by the appellant was not  uncommon
    and could not greatly contribute to the existence  of  very  compelling
    circumstances which outweigh the public interest in  deportation.   The
    quotation also mentions the need to deter others.

32. In relation to the FtJ's conclusions in terms of the undue harshness of
    the appellant's deportation with reference to Article 8, it  is  argued
    that the FtJ had failed to  identify  anything  exceptional  about  the
    appellant  and  his  partner's  situation  which  would  outweigh   the
    compelling public interest in removal.  It is  asserted  that  the  FtJ
    misunderstood the correct test.  In terms of  the  conclusion  that  it
    would be unduly harsh for the appellant's partner to remain in  the  UK
    without him, the FtJ had simply  relied  on  their  relationship  being
    based on "love and affection".  That was inconsistent with authority.

33. The general assertion in this respect is that the FtJ's decision failed
    to  give  appropriate  consideration  to   the   public   interest   in
    deportation.  Likewise, he had failed properly  to  consider  and  give
    sufficient  weight  to  the   appellant's   serious   criminality   and
    immigration history.

34. In submissions, Mr Avery relied on the grounds.  He submitted that  the
    FtJ's  decision  was  "slightly  baffling"  in  terms  of  the  way  he
    approached the issue of internal relocation, and his decision in  terms
    of destitution was completely unreasoned. Whether in relation to  Kabul
    province or Kabul city, the FtJ's findings were flawed.  He had  failed
    to take into account what was said in AK (Afghanistan).

35. In terms of his conclusion that the appellant's home area of Shakardara
    district in northern Kabul province was historically a Taliban  hotbed,
    it was submitted that  there  was  no  evidence  in  relation  to  that
    conclusion.  The appellant's skeleton argument before the FtJ indicated
    some evidence of Taliban activity in that area but the FtJ's  reasoning
    was hard to follow.

36. In terms of the s. 72 certificate, the FtJ  had  not  properly  engaged
    with it and had muddled that with the asylum aspect of the appeal.

37. The conclusions in relation to undue  harshness  were  rather  hard  to
    follow, it was submitted, and the FtJ had completely failed  to  engage
    with the deportation issue in terms of the impact on his partner in the
    UK.  Their relationship was such that they do  not  live  together  and
    there was no real assessment of why it would be unduly harsh  for  them
    to be separated over and above what would normally  be  expected  in  a
    relationship.  That indicated that the FtJ had not really "got a  grip"
    of that aspect of the appeal.

38. In relation to risk in his home area, it was accepted that that was the
    weakest of the grounds on behalf of the respondent but the FtJ had  not
    explained why there was a risk to the appellant.  It was submitted that
    "fundamentally" the decision was "all wrong" and needed to be  re-made.
    No aspect of the decision could be "rescued".

39. Mr Lay relied on his skeleton argument. He submitted that at  [59]  the
    FtJ had indicated an appreciation of the  structure  required  for  his
    decision and on the issue of whether internal relocation to  Kabul  was
    reasonable.  It was submitted that he was entitled to find that it  was
    reasonably likely that the appellant would become destitute  and  would
    be at  risk  in  his  home  area.   He  had  applied  para  339K  (past
    persecution) and there was background evidence before him.

40. The decision in AK (Afghanistan)  was  not  relevant  in  circumstances
    where it was not argued that there was  an  Article  15c  risk  outside
    Kabul.  The reasonableness of relocation was always  going  to  be  the
    issue.

41. It was submitted that there was background evidence in terms of  a  New
    York Times article on the issue of "infiltrators" and there was also  a
    European Asylum Support Office ("EASO") report, both of which were  put
    before the FtJ.  That material was provided on the day of  the  hearing
    and the respondent was aware of it.

42. In relation to Kabul province  and  Kabul  city  there  were  different
    arguments.  In [72] the FtJ was considering the  issue  of  destitution
    and internal relocation.  His conclusion was that he would be  at  risk
    in his home area and could not go to Kabul.  One needed to look at  the
    whole context of the decision.

43. In terms of the conclusions on the s. 72 certificate,  as  set  out  at
    [22] of the skeleton argument before us  the  appellant  had  completed
    prison courses and obtained qualifications.  The  risk  of  reoffending
    was said to be low and there was a letter from  his  current  probation
    officer which confirmed the low risk of serious harm and  low  risk  of
    reoffending.   The  "muddle"  earlier  in  his  decision  at  [17]  was
    therefore of no consequence.  At [61] and [62] the FtJ had referred  to
    the low risk of reoffending.

44. In relation to the issue of undue harshness under Article  8,  the  FtJ
    had given clear reasons as to why the appellant's partner could not  go
    to Kabul.  The issue was in relation to her remaining in the UK without
    him.  At [88] the FtJ had referred to s. 117C of the 2002 Act  and  the
    decision in MM (Uganda).  At [91] he had summarised the nature of their
    relationship and he was entitled to take into  account  the  impact  of
    separation on her.  He was also entitled to reach the view that it  was
    unduly harsh because of the compelling oral  evidence  that  he  heard.
    That was sufficient reasoning.

45. In any event, he went on to conclude that with reference to para 398(c)
    there   were    compelling    circumstances    making    his    removal
    disproportionate.  He had  cited  the  decision  in  Kamara.   All  the
    circumstances were capable of being very compelling,  as  explained  by
    the FtJ at [93].

46. In reply, Mr Avery repeated earlier submissions and  added  that  there
    was no reference by the FtJ to the appellant's offending or the  nature
    of that offending.  He had failed to deal  with  the  public  interest.
    There was no reference anywhere to any country guidance on Afghanistan.
     It was not clear on what basis he found that there was a risk  in  his
    home area.

    Conclusions

47. We have no hesitation in concluding that the respondent's arguments  in
    terms of the errors in the FtJ's decision have merit, and conversely we
    are  wholly   unpersuaded   by   the   appellant's   counter-arguments,
    notwithstanding the eloquence and vigour of Mr Lay's submissions.

48. As a general observation, we must  say  that  it  appears  to  us  that
    various aspects of the FtJ's decision are unclear, lack reasons, or are
    unfocused, all of which affect the overall coherence of his decision.

49. In relation to the s. 72 certificate, it  is  true  that  the  evidence
    before the FtJ was  to  the  effect  that  there  was  a  low  risk  of
    reoffending and a low risk of serious harm, as the FtJ said at [61] and
    [62].  However, early  on  in  his  consideration  of  the  issues,  he
    squarely equated the appellant's country  of  origin,  which  no  doubt
    accurately he described as "volatile", with a decision  not  to  uphold
    the certificate.  Whether the appellant has been convicted of a serious
    crime or represents a danger to the community of  the  UK  has  nothing
    whatever to do with where he comes  from  and  the  security  situation
    there.  The FtJ's statement that it was important that  he  heard  full
    details of the appellant's asylum claim suggests that  he  had  already
    decided that the certificate was not to be upheld,  regardless  of  the
    evidence on the issue.

50. Whilst there is something to be said for the proposition  that  in  the
    light of the evidence any error of law in  that  aspect  of  the  FtJ's
    decision was not material, because of the evidence of  a  low  risk  of
    reoffending, we are not persuaded that such is the case.  The appellant
    has been convicted of serious offences and the issue of danger  to  the
    community needed to be assessed within a correct  appreciation  of  the
    relevant legal framework.  This was not done by the FtJ  and  for  that
    reason his conclusion that the appellant does not constitute  a  danger
    to the community of the United Kingdom cannot stand.

51. In relation to the assessment of risk on  return,  the  FtJ's  decision
    fails to identify the background evidence that he relied on in  support
    of his conclusions at [69] and [70].  It is true that there was  before
    the FtJ a New York Times article, albeit that the FtJ did not  identify
    it as being the foundation for his conclusion that there  was  "regular
    infiltration" into Kabul province.   The  article  is  headed  "Afghans
    Build Security, and Hope to Avoid Infiltrators".   However,  it  is  an
    article that relates to infiltration into the security  forces  by  the
    Taliban.  Furthermore, it is dated 27 June 2011.  To suggest that  this
    is a sufficient basis from which the FtJ could conclude that there  was
    regular infiltration into Kabul province is misconceived.

52. As suggested in the appellant's skeleton argument it is true that there
    was an EASO report on Afghanistan before the FtJ.  It is dated November
    2016.  However,  if  the  FtJ  was  relying  on  that  report  for  his
    conclusions at [69] in relation to the appellant's home area or [71] in
    relation to the deteriorating security situation in the  country  as  a
    whole, he ought to have made that clear in his decision.

53. Further, in relation to what the FtJ said  at  [69]  in  terms  of  the
    appellant's home area being "historically a Taliban  hotbed",  the  New
    York Times article in fact states that the  appellant's  home  area  of
    Shakardara, described as a small farming district north of  Kabul,  "at
    one time had been a hotbed of Taliban activity".  That is not the  same
    as the FtJ stating that it was "historically" a Taliban  hotbed,  which
    suggests that it remains such.

54. The EASO report contains information in relation to Kabul city and  the
    security situation there as well as in relation to Kabul province.   If
    the FtJ was basing his decision as to infiltration into Kabul  province
    on that report, it was incumbent upon him to identify  the  report  and
    explain which aspects of it supported  that  contention.   There  is  a
    reference in the report to Taliban infiltration into Kabul province but
    that alone is not a sufficient basis from which to  conclude  that  any
    error of law in the FtJ's decision in this respect is immaterial.   The
    detail and import of those aspects of the EASO report  needed  to  have
    been explained by the FtJ in terms of what support it provided for  his
    conclusions.

55. Further, we are not satisfied that the FtJ's reasoning in  relation  to
    Article 3 and humanitarian protection is sustainable.  We  have  quoted
    [72] of his decision  at  [15]  above.   The  first  sentence  of  that
    paragraph is on its face  rather  muddled.   The  conclusion  that  the
    appellant would  be  living  in  conditions  of  destitution  makes  no
    reference to any background material or any country guidance.

56. Furthermore, although it is true that the appellant came here  when  he
    was 16 years of age, that does not mean  that  he  is  unfamiliar  with
    Afghanistan as a whole, or Kabul province in particular.  That is aside
    from whatever may be said about his ability to sustain himself in Kabul
    city.  His evidence recorded  by  the  FtJ  at  [42]  is  that  he  has
    experience of working in the catering and construction  industries  and
    was  at  that  time  doing  construction  courses   to   increase   his
    employability. At [49] it records his evidence as being that he  speaks
    Pashtun, albeit that he cannot read or write  it.   He  obviously  also
    speaks English.

57. Furthermore, regardless of what may be said about risk to the appellant
    in Kabul province, the FtJ has not explained why he concluded that  the
    appellant would be at risk in  the  city  of  Kabul.   His  conclusions
    appear to fail to have regard to the COI which he  quoted  at  [70]  in
    terms of consideration needing to be given to whether the Taliban  have
    the motivation to track and pursue a  person  considered  low  profile,
    which this appellant undoubtedly is, on his account.

58. Further, at [72] the FtJ said that he did not believe that he needed to
    deal with Article 3/humanitarian protection "in detail" because of  his
    view that the appellant succeeded on the asylum aspect  of  the  claim.
    However, we have already explained our view that the  FtJ's  assessment
    of the asylum ground of appeal is flawed.  He  did  therefore  need  to
    deal with issues in relation to humanitarian protection and  Article  3
    in detail, and again he did not do so.

59.  Our  view  that  the  FtJ  misapplied  the  law  in  relation  to  his
    consideration of the s. 72 certificate is reinforced by  the  statement
    at [73] of his decision to the effect that he did not believe that  the
    appellant remained a danger to the community  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    That followed his conclusions in relation to Article 3 and humanitarian
    protection at [72] and  the  repeated  conclusion  that  the  appellant
    succeeded in his asylum claim.  The finding at [73] that  he  does  not
    remain a danger to the community, immediately after a consideration  of
    those issues, further supports our view that the FtJ at [17]  conflated
    considerations in relation to the s. 72  certificate  with  the  asylum
    aspect of the appeal.

60. The FtJ was entitled to conclude that the  appellant  and  his  partner
    were in a committed relationship. On the facts of this case he  had  to
    consider whether it would be unduly harsh for the  appellant's  partner
    to return to Afghanistan with him or  for  her  to  remain  in  the  UK
    without him.  He said at [79] that the respondent accepted "at the very
    least" that it would not be reasonable for the appellant's  partner  to
    go to Afghanistan with him.  This is a matter dealt with  at  [166]  of
    the respondent's decision.  There it is stated  that  "It  is  accepted
    that it may be unduly harsh" for her to  live  in  Afghanistan  if  she
    chose to do so, although the same paragraph goes on to  state  that  no
    evidence had been provided to suggest that she would  face  significant
    difficulties or severe  hardship  there,  because  he  would  be  in  a
    position to help her to adjust to life  in  Afghanistan.   However,  we
    bear in  mind  that  the  respondent's  grounds  of  challenge  to  the
    respondent's decision do not suggest that there is  any  error  in  the
    FtJ's conclusion that it would be unduly harsh for her to  return  with
    him to Afghanistan.

61. Nevertheless, we do consider that the FtJ's conclusion that it would be
    unduly harsh for her to remain in the  UK  without  the  appellant,  in
    other words for them to be separated, is bereft of sustainable reasons.
     In reality, the FtJ's reasons amount to nothing more than a conclusion
    that they are in a committed relationship and  they  ought  not  to  be
    separated because of the impact that it would have on them as a couple.



62. However, it is clear from authority, if  authority  were  needed,  that
    separation of families is the natural consequence of deportation.   The
    issue of undue harshness has to  be  seen  in  context.   That  context
    includes the demands of the  public  interest  in  the  deportation  of
    foreign  criminals  who  have  committed  serious  offences,  as   this
    appellant has.  There is virtually nothing in the FtJ's reasoning which
    reveals any recognition of the public interest considerations in  play.
    Further, we cannot see  in  the  reasons  given  by  the  FtJ  how  the
    appellant's separation from his partner amounts to undue harshness,  or
    factors which indicate that their separation is likely to have any more
    impact on them than would ordinarily be the case in deportation.

63. We reject the contention on behalf of the appellant that  the  test  of
    undue harshness can be met by an appellant who persuades a  judge  that
    he/she and their partner have such a bond between each  other  that  it
    would be unduly harsh to separate them.  Such a proposition amounts  to
    little more than an assertion that an appeal to emotion can  carry  the
    day in terms of the test of undue  harshness.   That  in  our  view  is
    simply an unsupportable proposition.

64. Similarly, we do not find in the FtJ's reasons a rational basis for the
    conclusion that there are very compelling  circumstances  going  beyond
    the demands of para 399(b).  The FtJ's  conclusion  as  to  the  likely
    prospects for the appellant on return appears to be a reference to  his
    earlier findings in terms of either risk  or  his  ability  to  sustain
    himself on return, or both.   We  have  already  indicated  that  those
    findings are legally flawed.

65. Furthermore, although the FtJ at [93] referred to the "mandatory public
    interest considerations", that reference to the public  interest  fails
    to engage meaningfully with the extent of the public interest  in  this
    case.  For example, there is no reference by the FtJ to  the  deterrent
    element of the public interest.

66. The errors of law in the FtJ's decision are  such  as  to  require  his
    decision to be set aside.  We have considered whether it is appropriate
    for the appeal to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    hearing.  We have concluded that in the light of the findings  of  fact
    which are not infected by the error of law and which can  therefore  be
    preserved, the appropriate course is for the re-making of the  decision
    to take place in the Upper Tribunal.

67. At the resumed hearing the parties will have the  opportunity  to  make
    submissions as to what findings of fact can be preserved.  Our  initial
    view, subject to the submissions of the parties, is that  the  findings
    that the appellant and his partner are in a genuine relationship,  that
    it would be unduly harsh to expect his partner to return to Afghanistan
    with him, and the finding that  the  appellant  has  given  a  credible
    account of events in Afghanistan prior to his  leaving,  are  the  only
    findings that can be preserved.

68. The following directions apply in respect of the resumed hearing.

                                 DIRECTIONS

1. Any further evidence relied on by either party is to be filed and  served
  no later than seven days before the next hearing.

2.   In respect of any person whom it is  proposed  to  call  to  give  oral
  evidence, there must be a witness statement drawn in sufficient detail to
  stand as evidence-in-chief such that there is no  need  for  any  further
  examination-in-chief. Any such witness statement must be filed and served
  no later than seven days before the next hearing.

3.   All further evidence relied  on  by  either  party  must  be  contained
  within a supplementary paginated and indexed bundle and must be filed and
  served no later than seven days before the next hearing.

4.   There must be a skeleton argument on behalf of the appellant filed  and
  served no later than seven days before the next hearing.

5.   At the next hearing the parties must be prepared  to  make  submissions
  as to what findings of fact made by the FtJ can be preserved.
