                  Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1.     The framework of these appeals is as follows.   The  Secretary  of
      State made decisions in respect of all  four  Respondents  dated  30th
      Sept 2013.  The two dominant decisions  were  those  relating  to  the
      mother and father respectively of the family concerned.  They are  the
      first and second Respondents. The third  and  fourth  Respondents  are
      their dependants.


      The Secretary of State decided that an award of nil  points  would  be
      made in respect of the first and second  Respondents'  claims  for  75
      points pursuant to their applications for variation of their leave  to
      remain in the United Kingdom as Tier 1 Entrepreneur Migrants.

   2.     On the face of the documents there  is  something  of  a  mismatch
      between the Secretary of State's decisions and  the  determination  of
      the First-tier Tribunal (the "FtT").  The  Secretary  of  State  found
      that as regards  compliance  with  the  various  requirements  of  the
      Immigration Rules there was a series of defects.  In contrast, the FtT
       found that there was but a  single  flaw.   It  is  recorded  in  the
      determination and confirmed  by  the  documentary  evidence  that  the
      Respondents submitted separate bank account statements.  One of  these
      demonstrated that the mother had, in round terms, �26,000 in her  bank
      account.  The second demonstrated that the father had in round  terms,
      some �30,000 in his  bank  account.   In  three  separate  places  (in
      paragraphs 25, 26 and 27) in its determination the  FtT  identifies  a
      single flaw, namely, a failure to demonstrate that all  of  the  funds
      were available to both the first and second Respondents. The Secretary
      of State's assessment was that, in the  language  of  the  Rules,  the
      first and second Respondents had failed to demonstrate that  each  had
      "equal level of control" over the entirety of the  funds  viz  �50,000
      minimum. Concurring with this assessment,  the  Judge  concluded  that
      this was non-compliant with paragraph 245DD and paragraph 41-SD of the
      Immigration Rules.

   3.   The judge also made reference to paragraph 52 (a)  and  (b)  of  the
      Rules.  These are encompassed within Table 4  which  is  part  of  the
      governing regime.  This is summarised in  the  following  sentence  at
      paragraph 27 of the determination:

         "From the  evidence  it  was  therefore  clear  that  although  the
         appellants both had the relevant funds they  were  unable  to  show
         that as an entrepreneurial team they both had equal access  to  the
         full amount being invested.  This needed  the  first  appellant  to
         have access to the funds in the second appellant's account and vice
         versa in order for them to be able to show that they were  able  to
         jointly invest the �50,000."


     This prompted the judge to conclude  that  the  Secretary  of  State's
      decision was in accordance with the law (see paragraph 27).

   4.     The judge then made  reference  to  a  document  entitled  "Policy
      Guidance" which had been brought  to  the  Tribunal's  attention,  and
      specifically, paragraphs 28 to 30 thereof.  The judge also quoted from
      the decision of the Upper Tribunal in  Naved  [2012]  UKUT  14  (IAC).
      Having done so the judge said the following, at [30]:

        "From the Policy Guidance Note provided it is evident that there is
        a possibility  for further documentary evidence to be obtained from
        the Appellants in relation to the application and  in  relation  to
        whether or not the  funds  contained  in  the  bank  accounts  were
        available  to  the  two  principal  Appellants.   It  is  therefore
        arguable that in failing to apply this policy that the Secretary of
        State has acted unfairly in failing to provide the  Appellants  the
        opportunity to present the relevant evidence  and  therefore  score
        the relevant points."


      The judge continued, in [31]:


        "On this issue I find that the decision in not awarding the  points
        was not in accordance  with  the  Policy  Guidance  issued  by  the
        Respondent herself in deciding these points-based applications.


      The judge did not particularise the respects in which there had been a
      failure to comply with the Policy Guidance.  This  was  the  basis  on
      which the appeals were allowed.  Permission to appeal was  granted  on
      this issue.


   5.     It is clear from both the Rules and the related policy guidance in
      vogue at the  material  time  (July  2013  version)  that  the  monies
      designed for investment in the proposed business can be shared by both
      members of the entrepreneurial team. This was not in  dispute  between
      the parties.  At  this  juncture,  I  turn  to  examine  the  impugned
      decisions of the Secretary of State, each dated 30 September 2013  and
      framed in identical language.   I  consider  that  these  suffer  from
      certain material flaws. First, while they purport to  acknowledge  the
      entrepreneurial team dimension of the Respondents' applications,  they
      treat the applications as if they were reliant on third party funding.
       This, in my judgment, is the correct construction of  the  decisions.
      This  was  plainly  erroneous,  since  these   were   not   individual
      entrepreneurial  applications  relying  on  third  party  donor  funds
      emanating from  sources  such  as  financial  institutions  or  family
      members. I  consider  that  the  wrong  prism  was  applied  to  these
      applications.   This  is  abundantly  clear  from,  inter  alia,   the
      following passage:

         "Furthermore, if the applicant is applying using money from a third
         party, he must provide all of  the  following  specified  documents
         ......"

         [My emphasis.]


    This discrete statement  prefaces  the  second  manifest  flaw  in  the
    decision, which proceeded to penalise the Respondents  for  a  supposed
    failure to comply with a series of requirements in the Rules which have
    no application to a  joint  entrepreneurial  team  proposal.   Thirdly,
    these errors were repeated in the points allocations of zero under  the
    separate rubrics of "funds held in  regulated  financial  institutions"
    and "funds disposal in the United Kingdom".


 6. The impugned decisions are, therefore, unsustainable in  law.   On  the
    discrete issue of access to each other's funds viz the requirement that
    each of the Respondents  have  "equal  level  of  control"  over  their
    partner's funds I am persuaded by the argument that,  on  the  evidence
    presented to the Secretary of State considered against the framework of
    the relevant Rules and the policy guidance, each of the Respondents was
    deemed to have consented  to  an  arrangement  whereby  both  had  full
    control over the totality of the funding.  In passing, I note that this
    would now appear to be clear beyond peradventure in consequence of  the
    new paragraph 41-SD of Appendix  A,  coupled  with  the  latest  policy
    guidance dated 01 October 2013, both operative from the latter date.


Decision

 7. While, properly, there should have been a Rule 24 Notice on  behalf  of
    the Respondents in this appeal, the absence of same is not fatal.   For
    reasons which differ from those of the FtT, I reach  the  same  result.
    Accordingly, this appeal is allowed to the extent that  it  is  not  in
    accordance with the Immigration Rules or the law and is hereby remitted
    to the Secretary of State for further consideration and fresh  decision
    in accordance with this judgment.


Postscript

 8. As appears from the heading of this decision, these appeals were  heard
    on 27 October 2014.   At the conclusion of the hearing I gave  an  oral
    judgment.  Regrettably, the production of this transcribed decision has
    been heavily delayed due to administrative error.  The  Upper  Tribunal
    apologises unreservedly to all parties for this aberration.
