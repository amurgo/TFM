                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The  appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against   the
    respondent's decision of 5 March 2020 refusing her  application  for  a
    family permit as the dependent sister of an EEA national.

2.   The judge dismissed the appeal.

3.   As a consequence of representations on paper  being  provided  by  both
    the appellant and the respondent, it is common ground that in light  of
    errors in the judge's  decision  the  matter  is  appropriately  to  be
    remitted for a full rehearing in the First-tier Tribunal.  I accept the
    arguments set out in particular  in  the  further  submissions  of  the
    appellant that the judge erred in her  application  of  the  case  law,
    considered matters which were not relevant and failed to apply the  law
    correctly.  As a consequence as noted above, by agreement  and  my  own
    conclusion on the judge's  decision,  the  matter  is  properly  to  be
    remitted for a full rehearing at Taylor House before a judge other than
    Judge Burns.

No anonymity direction is made.
