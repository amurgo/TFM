Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Lindsay, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms A Radford of counsel, instructed by Turpin &
                    Miller LLP (Oxford) Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. On 19 May 2020, we issued a decision in which we allowed, in part,  the
    Secretary of State's appeal against the First-tier Tribunal's  decision
    to allow CD's appeal against the revocation of his  protection  status.
    That decision is appended to this one subject to correcting an  obvious
    error that Ms Radford drew to our attention at the resumed hearing.


 2. In order to avoid confusion, we intend to refer to CD as the  appellant
    and the Secretary of State as the respondent throughout this decision.


 3. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 we make an order prohibiting the disclosure or publication of  any
    matter likely to lead members of the public to identify  the  appellant
    or his family. Breach of this order can be punished as  a  contempt  of
    court. We make this order because the appellant is an asylum seeker and
    so entitled to anonymity.


 4. In our earlier decision, we concluded, firstly, that the Ft-T  had  not
    erred in law in deciding that  the  circumstances  in  connection  with
    which the appellant had been recognised as a refugee had not ceased  to
    exist.  We concluded that the  Ft-T's  decision  to  allow  the  appeal
    against the Secretary of State's cessation of his  refugee  status  had
    accordingly been properly open to it, as had the decision to allow  the
    appeal under Articles 2 and 3  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights.

 5. We decided, secondly, that the Ft-T had erred in law  in  reaching  the
    conclusion that the  appellant  was  a  refugee  who  continued  to  be
    protected from refoulement by Article 33(1) of the Refugee  Convention.
    We concluded that the Ft-T had erred in its assessment of  one  of  the
    two questions posed by Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention and  s72
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002;  namely,  whether
    the  appellant  had  rebutted  the  statutory   presumption   that   he
    represented a danger to  the  community  of  the  United  Kingdom.   We
    ordered that the latter aspect of the decision would be remade  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.  This decision follows  a  further  hearing  which  was
    convened for that purpose.

 6. As a result of our decision  to  uphold  and  to  preserve  the  Ft-T's
    conscientious assessment of  the  ongoing  risk  to  the  appellant  in
    Turkey, he cannot (subject  to  any  further  proceedings)  be  removed
    there.  That course is prohibited by the United  Kingdom's  obligations
    under  the  ECHR.   The  decision  that  we  make  in  respect  of  the
    application of Article  33(2)  is  nevertheless  significant,  for  the
    following reasons.

 7. A deportation order  has  been  made  against  the  appellant  and  the
    Indefinite Leave to Remain ("ILR") which he hitherto enjoyed  has  been
    invalidated by operation of statute.  In the  event  that  we  conclude
    that he has rebutted the statutory presumptions in s72 of the 2002 Act,
    and that he is therefore a refugee to whom the United Kingdom owes  the
    obligation of non-refoulement, he will be granted a five-year residence
    permit under paragraph 339Q of the Immigration Rules.  In  that  event,
    he would be entitled to apply for Indefinite Leave after holding  leave
    in that capacity for five years, under paragraph 339R.

 8. Alternatively, in the event that we conclude that  the  appellant  must
    not benefit from the protection  against  refoulement  in  the  Refugee
    Convention, any residence permit granted to him  under  paragraph  339Q
    would not be for five years.  Instead, he would be  granted  Restricted
    Leave by the Secretary of  State.   The  Restricted  Leave  regime  was
    recently analysed in detail (by Nicol J and UTJ  Stephen  Smith)  in  R
    (MBT) v SSHD [2019] UKUT 414 (IAC); [2020] Imm AR 615.   As  the  Upper
    Tribunal explained, a recipient of  Restricted  Leave  is  'subject  to
    regular and renewed grants of short periods of limited leave to remain,
    in a process which can continue for many  years.':  [2].   That  stated
    intention behind the policy is to ensure that  the  individual  can  be
    removed at the  earliest  possible  opportunity.   In  the  event  that
    Article 3 ECHR continued to preclude that course, it  is  quite  likely
    that the appellant would not be eligible for Indefinite Leave to Remain
    for thirty years.


Background

 9. The appellant is a Turkish national who was born on 3 January 1968.  He
    entered the United Kingdom and claimed asylum in 1995,  aged  27.   His
    asylum claim was refused but he was  granted  four  years'  Exceptional
    Leave to Remain ("ELR") in August 2000.


10. On 5 April 2002, the appellant's home was searched by  the  police  for
    material relevant to an overseas investigation[1].  He had fallen under
    suspicion of drug trafficking in Holland.  He was arrested for being in
    possession of a self-loading pistol and six rounds of ammunition  which
    were in the magazine.  In  November  that  year  he  was  convicted  of
    possessing those items without a  certificate  and  sentenced  to  four
    years' imprisonment.  The  Secretary  of  State  initiated  deportation
    proceedings as a result of that  conviction.   The  appellant  resisted
    deportation on protection and human rights grounds.

11. On 2 March 2006, the appellant's appeal against the  deportation  order
    was allowed by Immigration Judge Haynes, who found that he would be  at
    risk on return to Turkey as a result of his  extensive  connections  to
    Kurdish separatism, his draft evasion, his convictions in the  UK,  and
    the fact that he had been the subject of a  Dutch  extradition  request
    for drug offences.  That conclusion was upheld by a panel of the Asylum
    and Immigration Tribunal chaired by Senior Immigration Judge  Lane  (as
    he then was) on 14 July 2006 and, on 30 October 2006,  he  was  granted
    ILR as a refugee.

12. The appellant  subsequently  fell  under  suspicion,  again,  of  being
    involved in the international drugs  trade.   A  listening  device  was
    installed at his home in Finchley and evidence  was  gathered  to  show
    that he was the head of  a  massive,  nationwide  operation,  importing
    drugs from all over the world for distribution to a broad customer base
    across the country.  He was arrested in July 2008 and was  subsequently
    convicted - along with two more junior members of the  operation  -  of
    offences  relating  to  the  importation  and  supply  of  heroin.   In
    sentencing him, HHJ Ainley noted that he was a 'very  major  player  in
    the heroin trade in this country' and he was 'at the top of this heroin
    importing and heroin wholesaling criminal business'.   The  amounts  of
    heroin were described by the judge as follows:

         The specific counts of the indictment are: keeping  41  kilogrammes
         of heroin at Brownlow Road, importing  64  kilogrammes  of  heroin.
         Conspiring to supply 9.81 kilogrammes of heroin almost seems  minor
         compared to those, yet in any other context  it  would  be  a  very
         serious crime indeed.


13. The appellant was given credit for his somewhat belated guilty plea and
    HHJ Ainley reduced the total sentence from 25  years'  imprisonment  to
    18.   He was made the subject of a substantial confiscation order, with
    a sentence of 5 years' imprisonment in default of payment.  HHJ  Ainley
    also imposed a Serious Crime Prevention Order ("SCPO"), restricting the
    appellant's  activities  for  five  years   after   his   release.    A
    confiscation order in the sum  of  �1.3  million  was  made  under  the
    Proceeds of Crime  Act  2002  by  Croydon  Crown  Court  in  2011.   At
    Westminster Magistrates' Court the appellant was  committed  to  prison
    for a further five years in default of payment in 2012.


14. The appellant's offending caused the respondent to initiate deportation
    action for a second  time.   Having  sought  his  representations,  and
    having consulted with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
    over the cessation of  his  refugee  status,  she  made  a  deportation
    decision against him on 26 February 2019.  A letter of  the  same  date
    explained the reasons that the respondent  had  decided  to  cease  the
    appellant's refugee status and to deport him to Turkey.

15. The appellant appealed and, as we have noted, his appeal to the  First-
    tier Tribunal was  allowed  on  protection  and  human  rights  grounds
    (Articles 2 and  3  ECHR).   The  respondent  sought  and  was  granted
    permission to appeal against that decision and the appeal to the  Upper
    Tribunal took the course  we  have  described  at  the  start  of  this
    decision.

Preliminary Matters


16.  At  the  outset  of  the  hearing,  we  asked  Ms  Radford  about  the
    confiscation order which had been made in the criminal courts.  We  had
    stated in our first decision that we were particularly concerned  about
    the effect of that order, if any, on the assessment we were to  perform
    in respect of the appellant's danger to the community.


17. Mr Radford  stated  that  a  confiscation  order  had  been  made,  the
    appellant had been unable to pay it, and that he had served five  years
    in prison in default of payment.  The  appellant  had  been  unable  to
    obtain any documents at all in relation to the confiscation proceedings
    and all she was able to do  was  to  ask  the  appellant  himself.   Ms
    Radford offered to  take  further  instructions  and  to  research  the
    relevant provisions under which the initial order had been made and the
    additional term of imprisonment ordered in default.

18. We also asked Ms Radford to draw to our attention the evidential  basis
    upon which it was to be submitted that the appellant had  reformed  and
    was able to rebut the presumption of dangerousness in s72.  She took us
    to the  OASys  report  which  had  been  prepared  in  February,  which
    indicated that the appellant posed a  low  risk  of  re-offending,  and
    submitted that this was to form the bedrock of her submissions in  this
    regard.

19. Upon resuming the hearing, Ms Radford referred us to  the  confiscation
    scheme in Part 2 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, particularly at s6-
    13B, and to s35, which applies the relevant parts of the Sentencing Act
    2000 and specifies the maximum term of  imprisonment  which  is  to  be
    served in default of payment of given sums.  Ms Radford's  instructions
    were that a confiscation order in the sum of �1.3 million had been made
    by the Crown Court.  A term of five years' imprisonment had been  fixed
    in the  event  of  non-payment  and  that  had  been  enforced  by  the
    Magistrates' Court in 2012.   She  did  not  seek  an  adjournment  and
    invited us to proceed on the basis of the evidence before us.


Evidence Before the Upper Tribunal

20. The Secretary of State did not file or serve any additional evidence in
    preparation for the resumed hearing  before  us.   She  relied  on  the
    bundle she had prepared for the hearing before the Ft-T, comprising the
    decision under appeal and the documents to which  she  referred  within
    that letter.  The appellant's solicitors filed and  served  an  updated
    bundle of 114 pages.  We also received a helpful skeleton argument from
    Ms Radford, who has represented the appellant throughout this appeal.

21. We heard oral evidence from the appellant, his  son  and  his  partner.
    Their evidence was given in English over the Skype link.  Each  witness
    was in a different location.  Mr Lindsay voiced no  objection  to  each
    remaining in the Skype 'meeting' whilst the other gave evidence.   This
    was a proper and realistic stance for him to adopt, given  the  absence
    of any real overlap in the subject matter of their oral  evidence.   We
    should record that the Skype  link  worked  very  well  throughout  the
    hearing, with no concerns  expressed  by  the  representatives  at  any
    stage.

    The Appellant's Evidence
22. The appellant adopted the statement he had prepared  for  the  hearing.
    In that statement, he explained that  he  had  been  granted  bail  and
    released from prison on 22 January 2020.  He had attended all Probation
    and Home Office meetings and made himself available for home visits and
    virtual appointments during the pandemic.  He  had  complied  with  the
    requirements of the  SCPO.   Two  friends,  TC  and  MT  had  been  his
    Financial Condition Supporters  at  the  bail  hearing.   He  had  been
    provided with long-term accommodation, free of charge, by MT.   He  had
    also been assisted by MT to settle into the area in which  he  was  now
    living.  He would have started a job which had been arranged for him by
    MT but he was  not  permitted  to  work.   TC  had  also  assisted  him
    financially and emotionally since his release.  It had been  difficult,
    particularly during lockdown, but he had kept active.  He had seen  his
    two children, who are adults with British citizenship, although much of
    their contact had been "virtual" due to the pandemic.  He had learned a
    variety of skills when he was in  prison  and  he  intended  to  become
    financially independent  so  that  he  could  give  something  back  to
    society.  He also wanted to undertake voluntary  work,  as  he  had  in
    prison.


23. Examined by Ms Radford, the appellant stated that he had been given six
    months to pay the confiscation order which was  imposed  by  the  trial
    judge but he had not had the means to pay it.  The judge had  used  the
    benefit figure, not  his  recoverable  assets,  which  were  less  than
    �30,000.  He was not able to pay the sum now.  He had had some money in
    the bank and some in his house and he had paid that but  that  was  all
    that he had.  Ms Radford noted that the OASys report had attached  some
    significance to the appellant's children in considering the risk of him
    reoffending but that this had also been said in the 2006 OASys  report.
    The appellant stated that he had said  the  same  thing  in  the  first
    report but that this was different.  He had been released  without  any
    support in 2006 and he had fallen in with the wrong people.  He had not
    known how to say no.  Now, he was older and his children had grown  up.
    He did not know whether they would forgive him for what  he  had  done.
    He had not seen them physically because of Coronavirus and it was  hard
    for him to ask for forgiveness  over  the  phone.   He  had  a  support
    network and he was wiser.  He had learned skills in prison, and he  had
    an industrial cleaning qualification, and certificates in  cooking  and
    cleaning.  He had communication skills  and  listening  skills,  having
    helped hardcore criminals who were nevertheless vulnerable  in  prison.
    He had taken a lot from society but he wanted to give a lot back.   His
    release in 2006 had been after he had served his full sentence; not  on
    licence.


24. Cross-examined by Mr Lindsay, the appellant stated that it was  correct
    to note that he had been in charge of the organisation but he had  been
    in the company of the wrong people.  He had caused many problems in the
    community and in his family by what he had done and  he  had  tried  to
    learn from that.  Things were different from how they had been in 2006,
    when he had been released without supervision from probation;  he  felt
    he had been abandoned at the end of his sentence.  Now he had a support
    group and it was completely different.  There were people who supported
    him financially and he knew that he should not repeat the  mistakes  he
    had made in the past.  As to the size of the confiscation order,  Judge
    Ainley had been upset with the prosecution when he imposed an order  in
    the sum of �1.3 million.  The burden had been on the appellant to  show
    that he had no money.  He had been in prison for years and then he  was
    required to serve a further five years in default of payment.   He  had
    not gained any money from his crimes.  He had made a  choice  to  be  a
    good  citizen  and  he  would  not  destroy  that  chance  again.   The
    confiscation order had become a civil  matter;  the  authorities  could
    take lottery winnings or inheritance but otherwise he  had  served  his
    sentence in default.  He intended to make an application  to  the  High
    Court for a 'certificate of adequacy' (we  consider  this  below).   He
    accepted that the risk of him  committing  further  offences  would  be
    higher if he became financially unstable or if  his  accommodation  was
    under threat but he had support and he was willing to work.  He did not
    need much.


25. The National Crime Agency kept  him  under  observation.   He  was  not
    allowed to speak to his co-defendants and the  people  around  him  now
    were not from his former associates.  There were no concerns about  him
    absconding; he had complied with his reporting  requirements  with  the
    Home Office and probation.  He was entirely reliant on his friends, but
    only  because  he  was  not  permitted  to  work.   He  had   extensive
    qualifications and a job offer.  His friends would not  withdraw  their
    support and he had a tenancy agreement which required  him  to  pay  no
    rent.  It did not matter that it was not legally binding in the absence
    of consideration.  He  was  not  applying  for  bankruptcy  but  for  a
    certificate of  adequacy  and  the  author  of  the  OASys  report  had
    misunderstood because English was the appellant's second language.   He
    did not play the system; he learned from the  system.   He  had  hosted
    great people at the prison restaurant and had been inspired.  He wanted
    a chance to use the opportunities he had been given.  He wanted to be a
    success story.  He accepted that he had been able to  hide  his  crimes
    from those around him.  He accepted what he had done and that he had  a
    leading role.  He had lost his children and his emotional wellbeing  as
    a result of what he had done.  He was  200%  sure  that  he  would  not
    commit any crime in the future.  He knew that he would die in prison if
    he did so.  His phone is always open and he  never  opened  himself  to
    temptation.


26. We asked the appellant some questions in order to clarify his evidence.
     We asked what had  happened  to  the  money  he  had  made  from  drug
    importation.  He said that �1.3 million was the benefit figure  of  the
    heroin but it had never been sold.  He had not given evidence  and  had
    not been able to convince the court that the available amount was  less
    than the �1.3 million required but Judge Ainley had fixed a lower  term
    of imprisonment than the 14 years which might have been imposed.  There
    had not been any previous drug transactions.  He had pleaded guilty  to
    three counts and the court had ordered that the others were  to  remain
    on the file.

27. We noted that there were  various  references  in  the  papers  to  the
    appellant possibly being extradited to Holland to face charges relating
    to drug exportation there.  He said that the case in Holland  had  been
    dropped after he brought a case in the High Court in  the  Netherlands.
    The prosecutor in charge of his case  had  been  changed  and  the  new
    prosecutor apologised to him.   He  was  told  that  he  could  receive
    compensation from the Dutch authorities but he preferred simply for the
    case against him to be dropped.

28. We asked the appellant about  the  'certificate  of  adequacy'  he  had
    described in his evidence.  He said that it was  an  application  which
    was made to the High Court to vary the confiscation order when a person
    was unable to pay the sum which had been fixed.  He was  going  to  use
    the same solicitors to make the application.  He was unable to instruct
    the partner who had previously had  conduct  of  the  case  as  he  had
    retired to Puerto Rico but another solicitor would take the  case  once
    he had spoken to counsel.  The firm was called BSB Solicitors.

29. Neither advocate had questions arising from our own.


    The Appellant's Son's Evidence
30. We then heard from the appellant's son, OD.  He adopted his  statement,
    subject to the clarification that he was currently  living  in  in  the
    Midlands,  where  he  plays  rugby  at  professional  level.   In   his
    statement, he said that he has a good relationship with his father  and
    that they keep in touch by telephone and  Facebook.   They  had  always
    been close, despite the appellant's time in prison.  He had  been  four
    when his father first went to prison (for the  firearms  offence).   He
    had remained in  prison  until  OD  was  about  eight.   He  remembered
    visiting him once when he was about  five,  before  he  understood  the
    reality of his situation.  The appellant had  been  released  for  less
    than a year before he returned to prison (initially on remand  for  the
    heroin offences).   From  the  age  of  nine,  he  visited  his  father
    regularly in prison and would also speak to him on the telephone.  When
    he began  university,  his  visits  reduced  to  once  a  year  but  he
    maintained the weekly telephone calls.  OD stated that he last  visited
    his father in January 2020, upon his release from prison.  He  had  not
    seen him since as a result of his sporting commitments and the pandemic
    but they speak regularly and have a  strong  relationship.   OD  firmly
    believes that his father will not offend in the future.  He had learned
    from  his  time  in  prison  and  he  understood  that  it   would   be
    unforgiveable, in the eyes of his family, if he committed  any  further
    offences.  All the appellant wanted, in his son's opinion, was to  have
    a normal life and to build a relationship with OD and his sister.


31. Cross-examined by Mr Lindsay, OD accepted that he would not know if his
    father returned to committing criminal offences, commenting that he had
    only found out at the hearing why his father had been imprisoned for so
    long on the second occasion.  They had never had any indication of  his
    criminal activity.  Mr Lindsay observed that the  reports  stated  that
    the appellant had been able to conceal his criminal activity.   OD  did
    not feel able to comment further on this.  Mr  Lindsay  suggested  that
    the appellant was also skilled at giving people the impression that  he
    had changed.  OD disagreed.  He considered his father to be honest  and
    he thought that he  understood  that  it  would  mark  an  end  to  his
    relationship with his children if he returned to prison.

32. OD was not re-examined.  We had no questions for him.


    The Appellant's Partner's Evidence
33. We also heard from the appellant's current partner,  TC.   She  adopted
    the witness statement she had made on 21 July 2020  but  she  clarified
    that she was the partner to whom the appellant had referred.  They  had
    started  a  relationship  earlier  in  2020,  when  the  appellant  was
    released.  In her statement, TC stated  that  she  had  been  a  Family
    Support Worker for the last decade and she had known him when she was a
    Prison Officer.  He was a trusted prisoner, who  had  assisted  in  the
    provision of food  and  also  provided  listening  services  for  other
    prisoners.  He had learned a variety of practical skills in prison  and
    had always been very hard working.  He had a lot to offer and wanted to
    give back to society.  She had supported him in various ways since  his
    release, including financial assistance of �50 per week and  help  with
    modern technology.  She was aware that he had complied with all of  the
    requirements imposed by the SCPO and the Home Office and that  he  had,
    in particular, registered his  telephone  and  his  computer  with  the
    National Crime Agency.  He clearly wanted to change and have a positive
    future.  TC valued his companionship very much.  She saw him 3-4  times
    per week and they were also in touch several times a day by Whatsapp.

34. Cross examined by Mr Lindsay, TC confirmed that she did not  live  with
    the appellant; she lived in Sutton and he lives in  West  London.   She
    did not accept Mr Lindsay's suggestion that she would not  know  if  he
    returned to criminality.  She stated that she had been a prison officer
    for 13 years and she had worked in probation  as  well.   Even  in  her
    present role, she worked with a variety of  families  with  a  criminal
    background.  She had attended  probation  and  NCA  meetings  with  the
    appellant and she knew that he had submitted all  relevant  information
    to the relevant agencies.  His phone was always open - she had given it
    to him - and she knew that all of the people he  associated  with  were
    positive peers.  She would know if he had another telephone; he was not
    allowed a second one.  He was monitored by the NCA.  She knew  her  way
    around his home and she had cleaned it.   She  would  know  if  he  was
    hiding a second phone; she had conducted  cell  searches  as  a  prison
    officer and she was very observant.   She  knew  there  was  no  second
    phone.  It was not correct to state that he was always able to  conceal
    what he was doing; if that was the case, he would not have been  caught
    in the first place.  He was always very open about his offending  past.
    Whilst he had accepted that he had concealed things in the  past,  that
    was 12 years ago and he was a different man then.   Asked  whether  the
    appellant was skilled at giving the impression of being a changed  man,
    TC stated that he was actually very reflective.  He is  now  older  and
    had no connection with the people with  whom  he  had  previously  been
    involved.  He had undertaken a lot of work in prison and was consistent
    in his commitment to rehabilitation.  Mr Lindsay noted that the  author
    of the OASys report  expressed  doubt  that  the  appellant  would  not
    contact his former associates but TC was adamant that he had  not  done
    so; he was monitored by the NCA and his phone is always open.

35. TC was not re-examined.  We had no questions for her.

Submissions

     Respondent's Submissions
36. Mr Lindsay relied on the Secretary of State's skeleton argument,  which
    had been settled by Mr Clarke.  It  was  seemingly  accepted  that  the
    appellant's crimes were particularly  serious  within  the  meaning  of
    Article 33(2) and the sole  question  was  whether  the  appellant  had
    rebutted the statutory presumption that he represents a danger  to  the
    community of the UK.  The Secretary  of  State  noted  that  the  OASys
    report from earlier in the year had concluded that he represented a low
    risk of re-offending.  In Mr Lindsay's  submission,  however,  the  14%
    risk of re-offending over the course of the next 2  years  was  a  real
    risk.  The consequences of any similar offending were to  be  borne  in
    mind, and we were invited to note that  there  was  said  in  the  same
    report to be a medium risk of serious harm to the public.  Mr Lindsay's
    first submission, therefore, was that even on the  face  of  the  OASys
    report, there was  a  proper  basis  to  conclude  that  the  appellant
    represented an ongoing danger to the UK.

37. The Secretary of State's second submission,  however,  was  that  there
    were serious concerns about the OASys  report  and  there  were  proper
    reasons for the Tribunal to reach a different view on the likelihood of
    the appellant reoffending.  The report noted that the  appellant  would
    be at greater risk of committing offences in  the  event  of  financial
    instability  or  housing  concerns.   The  author  of  the  report  had
    proceeded on the basis that there were no such concerns because he  was
    given money by his friends and a flat had been provided for him to live
    in free-of-charge.  That was an unsafe foundation for  the  conclusions
    reached in the report, however, since it was  clear  that  the  tenancy
    agreement into which the appellant had entered  was  unenforceable  for
    want of consideration.  The appellant was also under financial pressure
    as a result of the confiscation order, the total of which had risen  to
    �2.2 million as a result of interest accrued.  The  appellant  said  he
    had no means to pay that sum but there  had  clearly  been  a  judicial
    finding that he had the means to pay it in the past.  The OASys  report
    had been in error in concluding that there was no financial pressure on
    the appellant; he was actually under significant financial pressure and
    in a state of very real financial instability. He was dependent  on  TC
    for small sums of money but his relationship with her was a recent  one
    and could not possibly guarantee that he would not feel under pressure.
     The fact that he had made contact with his criminal solicitors and was
    considering making an application for a  certificate  of  adequacy  was
    evidence of the pressure he was actually under.


38. The author of the OASys report had been unsure  whether  the  appellant
    was merely saying what he should,  and  whether  his  protestations  of
    reform were merely lip service.  There  were  also  concerns  expressed
    about him absconding.  It was no doubt the case - as Ms  Radford  would
    submit - that the report was careful and thorough but what  the  author
    of the report had overlooked in assessing risk was his belief that  the
    appellant would make contact with his previous peers.

    Appellant's Submissions
39. Ms Radford relied on her skeleton argument and submitted that there was
    not a great deal of authority on the point at issue.  What  there  was,
    however, was the UNHCR's opinion on the  restrictive  manner  in  which
    Article 33(2) should be applied.  That opinion was to be  treated  with
    great respect.  The question for the Tribunal to consider  was  whether
    there was a real risk of the repetition of the same crime, whereas  the
    limited risk in the OASys report was of any  offending.   UNHCR's  view
    was that Article 33(2) was only to be applied in cases where a  refugee
    was likely to offend again.  It was to be recalled that the  Convention
    is an international instrument which was to be interpreted consistently
    across  the  world.   In  the  UK,  and  other  countries  which   were
    signatories to the ECHR, there was no  risk  of  a  refoulable  refugee
    actually being returned to a place where they would be subjected to ill-
    treatment. In non-signatory  countries,  however,  the  application  of
    Article 33(2) exposed a refugee to the likelihood of  serious  harm  on
    return to their country of origin.  It was for that reason  that  there
    should be a real risk of  the  commission  of  serious  crimes  in  the
    future.  The assessment of risk in this context was not  comparable  to
    the assessment of risk under Article  1A(2)  of  the  Convention.   The
    latter provision was for assessing the risk to an  individual,  whereas
    Article 33(2) was about the justification of exposing an individual  to
    a risk which was known to exist.


40. The assessment of whether the appellant posed a risk to  the  community
    of the UK was prospective in character.  It had been submitted  by  the
    Secretary of State that the appellant's  accommodation  was  precarious
    but there was obviously nothing in that concern.  The probation officer
    was satisfied with the offer of accommodation and there was  no  reason
    to go behind that view.  As for  the  confiscation  order,  it  was  an
    accepted fact that the appellant had failed to persuade the Crown Court
    that he had a smaller sum of money than the benefit  figure  which  was
    automatically based on the value of the heroin recovered.  That was  in
    2011, however, and there was no indication that he had  been  receiving
    money from  his  previous  activities  since  then.   The  confiscation
    proceedings were also known to, and considered by, the authors  of  the
    OASys report.  The existence of that order and the interest  which  had
    accrued upon it, did not mean that the appellant  was  more  likely  to
    resort to crime than the authors of the report had thought.

41. It had been submitted by Mr Lindsay  that  there  was  a  risk  of  the
    appellant absconding but it was clear that this had  been  expunged  in
    2010; the OASys report showed that the escape list alert had been  made
    inactive  in  August  that  year.   There  was  no  proper   evidential
    foundation for a  conclusion  that  the  OASys  assessment  was  wrong,
    particularly when it was so clear from the evidence as a whole that the
    appellant had engaged diligently with courses in prison and supervision
    thereafter.  He was consistently described as being  open  and  honest.
    It was to be noted that the author of the OASys report  had  said  that
    they were 'not sure' whether the appellant was paying  lip  service  to
    rehabilitation, and that was a very different observation  from  saying
    that he was actually doing so.  The appellant had not given evidence in
    his confiscation proceedings and there was no judicial finding that  he
    was not a credible witness.  He could not alter the past.   The  medium
    risk of serious harm was said to be unlikely and would only come  about
    in the event of a change of circumstances.  It was clear that he had  a
    stable support network, including TC, who had known him  for  12  years
    and was in a proper position to provide financial  and  other  support.
    Whether the appellant was making an application  for  bankruptcy  or  a
    certificate of adequacy, neither was an indication  that  there  was  a
    lack of stability in his life.  In reality, all  the  indications  were
    that he had rehabilitated and was unlikely to re-offend.  He was not  a
    danger to the community and the decision on the appeal should be remade
    by allowing it on the basis that  the  appellant's  removal  to  Turkey
    would be contrary to the Refugee Convention.

Legal Framework

42. It was accepted by the Ft-T that the appellant remains  a  refugee  and
    that his expulsion would be contrary to Articles 2 and 3  ECHR.   Those
    findings were not erroneous in law and are preserved.  The only  matter
    in issue between the parties before us, as we have explained above,  is
    whether the appellant is a refoulable refugee.


43. We do not propose to set out Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention or
    Article 21 of the Qualification Directive  (2004/83/EC).   It  suffices
    for present purposes to set out in their current form the salient parts
    of section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002:


         72 Serious criminal
         1) This section applies for the purpose  of  the  construction  and
            application  of  Article  33(2)  of   the   Refugee   Convention
            (exclusion from protection).


         2) A person shall be presumed to have been  convicted  by  a  final
            judgment of a particularly serious crime  and  to  constitute  a
            danger to the community of the United Kingdom if he is-
            (a)   convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence, and
            (b)   sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of  at  least  two
                years.


         (3) - (5) ...


         6) A presumption under subsection (2), (3) or  (4)  that  a  person
            constitutes a danger to the  community  is  rebuttable  by  that
            person.


         7) ...

         8) Section 34(1) of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001
            (c. 24) (no need to  consider  gravity  of  fear  or  threat  of
            persecution) applies for the purpose of  considering  whether  a
            presumption mentioned in subsection (6) has been rebutted as  it
            applies for the purpose of considering whether Article 33(2)  of
            the Refugee Convention applies.


         9) Subsection (10) applies where-
            (a)  a person appeals under section 82 of this  Act  or  under
                section 2 of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission  Act
                1997 (c. 68) wholly or partly on the  ground  [mentioned  in
                section 84(1)(a) or (3)(a) of this Act (breach of the United
                Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee Convention), and
            (b)  the  Secretary  of  State  issues  a  certificate   that
                presumptions under subsection (2), (3) or (4) apply  to  the
                person (subject to rebuttal).


        10)  The Tribunal or Commission hearing the appeal-
            (a)  must begin substantive  deliberation  on  the  appeal  by
                considering the certificate, and
            (b)  if in agreement that presumptions under  subsection  (2),
                (3) or (4) apply (having given the appellant an  opportunity
                for rebuttal) must dismiss the appeal in so far as it relies
                on the ground specified in subsection (9)(a).


         (10A)  Subsection (10) also  applies  in  relation  to  the  Upper
              Tribunal when it  acts  under  section  12(2)(b)(ii)  of  the
              Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.


         (11)  For the purposes of this section-
            (a)  "the Refugee Convention"  means the Convention relating to
                the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28th July 1951  and
                its Protocol, and
            (b) ...

44. The leading domestic authority on these provisions remains that of  the
    Court of Appeal in EN (Serbia) & KC (South Africa) [2009] EWCA Civ 630;
    [2010] QB 633. Stanley Burnton LJ gave the leading judgment, with which
    Laws and Hooper LJJ agreed.  Certain aspects of the decision,  such  as
    those concerning the vires of the 2004 Order or Article  14(5)  of  the
    Directive, are not relevant for  the  purposes  of  this  appeal.   The
    following aspects are very relevant to our  assessment  of  the  danger
    which the appellant poses to the community of the UK:


      i) The authorities relied upon by the claimants (including  commentary
         from Professor Hathaway and a joint opinion provided to the  UNHCR)
         added an  unjustified  gloss  on  Article  33(2)  insofar  as  they
         suggested that it might only be applied in the most exceptional  of
         circumstances where the refugee posed a very serious danger to  the
         host country: [43].


     ii) "The words "particularly serious crime" are nevertheless clear, and
         themselves restrict drastically the offences to which  the  Article
         applies. So far as "danger to  the  community"  is  concerned,  the
         danger must be real, but if a person is convicted of a particularly
         serious crime, and there is a real risk of its  repetition,  he  is
         likely to constitute a danger to the community.": [45]

    iii) Normally, the danger required by Article 33(2) is  demonstrated  by
         proof of the particularly serious  offence  and  the  risk  of  its
         recurrence or of the recurrence of a similar offence.  But it  does
         not expressly require a causal connection and  one  is  not  to  be
         implied: [46].


     iv) The rebuttable presumptions of seriousness and dangerousness in s72
         were  not  incompatible  with  the  Refugee   Convention   or   the
         Qualification Directive: [66].  The statute is  to  be  interpreted
         conformably with the QD as creating rebuttable presumptions in both
         respects: [80].

      v) In practice, once the State has established that a person has  been
         convicted of what is on the  face  of  it  a  particularly  serious
         crime, it will be for him to show either that it was  not  in  fact
         particularly serious, because of mitigating factors associated with
         its  commission,  or  that  because  there  is  no  danger  of  its
         repetition he does not constitute a danger to the community: [66]

45. We do not consider the later authorities cited at [5] of  Ms  Radford's
    skeleton to cast any doubt on the decision in EN & KC.  Al-Sirri v SSHD
    [2012] UKSC 54; [2013] 1 AC 745 was a decision concerning Article 1F(C)
    of the Convention.  EN & KC was cited to the Supreme Court (p765 of the
    Appeal Cases report refers) but nothing was said about its correctness.
     The restrictive approach to which  the  court  referred  at  [75]  was
    specifically directed to the exclusion  clauses,  and  not  to  Article
    33(2).  And nothing said by Dingemans J (as he then was)  in  R  (W)  v
    SSHD [2019] EWHC 254 (Admin) could, as  a  matter  of  precedent,  cast
    doubt on what was said by the Court of Appeal.


46. Insofar as Ms Radford draws at some length, at [2]-[9] of her  skeleton
    upon various UNHCR Guidelines and other such documents which support  a
    restrictive application of Article 33(2) and a requirement for a  'very
    serious' threat to the host state, similar submissions were  considered
    and rejected in EN & KC.  Despite the  considerable  respect  which  is
    given to the opinions of the UNHCR in Refugee  Convention  matters  (IA
    (Somalia) [2014] UKSC 6; [2014] 1 WLR 384  refers),  we  are  bound  to
    adopt the approach of the Court of Appeal,  and  simply  to  apply  the
    plain and clear words of Article 33(2) and the  Directive,  subject  to
    section 72: [51] of EN & KC refers.  We  nevertheless  recognise  -  in
    light of H.T. v Land Baden-W�rttemberg (Case C-373/13); [2016] 1 CMLR 6
    - that the practice of refoulement is subject to  rigorous  conditions,
    and that any consideration of such questions must  be  undertaken  with
    the most anxious scrutiny.

Discussion

47. In considering whether the appellant has rebutted the presumption  that
    he represents a danger to the community of the UK, we  have  considered
    all of the evidence which has been placed before us.  The salient parts
    of that evidence, in broadly chronological order, are as follows.


48. The appellant was 27 years old when he arrived in the United Kingdom in
    1995.  He stated in his screening interview (on 7 June  2005)  that  he
    had been self-employed as a 'middle-man', trading goods when  he  lived
    in Turkey.  In April 2002, he was arrested in possession  of  a  pistol
    with six rounds of ammunition in the magazine.  He initially sought  to
    suggest that the weapon belonged to a man who  was  visiting  him  from
    Holland at the time but, 'at the last moment',  he  pleaded  guilty  to
    possessing the weapon and the ammunition without a certificate and  was
    sentenced by HHJ Hordern QC to a total of four years' imprisonment.  He
    said that he had  bought  the  gun  to  protect  himself  from  Turkish
    terrorists in the UK who had threatened him.

49. An OASys report was prepared for the  Risk  Assessment  and  Management
    Board ("RAM  Board")  on  26  May  2004.   Amongst  other  things,  the
    following matters were noted in that report.  The appellant was on  the
    enhanced regime for good behaviour at HMP Long Lartin.  It was  unclear
    whether we would be  released  in  December  2004  because  extradition
    proceedings brought by the Netherlands remained pending, in  which  the
    appellant was accused in the exportation of heroin  between  1  January
    2000 and 5 April 2002.  The author of the report adjudged the appellant
    to present a low risk of reconviction for "other offences" (non-violent
    or sexual) within two years but to present "some" risk of  reconviction
    for violent offences within two years.  The appellant told  the  author
    of the report that he planned to return to Middlesex to live  with  his
    partner and that they ran a business exporting sheepskin  from  Ireland
    to Turkey.  He had been educated to the age of twelve and he  struggled
    with English.  There was no evidence that  financial  hardship  was  an
    issue.  He was separated  from  his  wife  and  children,  although  he
    remained in contact with  them.   There  was  not  thought  to  be  any
    negative  influence  from  others  and  there  was  no  evidence  of  a
    manipulative or predatory lifestyle.  There was  one  adjudication  for
    fighting in April 2003.  There were no reported substance abuse issues,
    although it was noted that he had a conviction for driving with  excess
    alcohol in 1998.  He was coping with custody, although he found it hard
    being away from his children and did feel guilty.  He had been a prison
    listener at HMP Belmarsh.  He communicated  well  with  staff  and  was
    noted to be polite.  His long term goals were to buy a  house,  have  a
    regular income and build a good life.  He had reflected on his  offence
    and had realised that it  was  wrong  to  have  an  unlicenced  gun  in
    England.  He had favourable wing reports and was a  wing  cleaner.   He
    and his family had suffered from his being  in  prison.   He  had  been
    unable to take any courses in prison due to his level of English and he
    needed to attend education to improve his reading and writing.


50. The risk of serious harm was considered at p32 of the report.   It  was
    thought that the appellant needed to avoid  alcohol  (so  as  to  avoid
    another drink driving offence) and 'contact with certain organisations'
    in order to prevent  any  risk  of  injury  from  firearms.   Asked  to
    consider whether the appellant had "the capacity to change  and  reduce
    offending", the author of the RAM report checked a box to indicate that
    he was "quite capable".  It was noted that he was quite  motivated  and
    had shown an encouraging interest in  education.   The  appellant  said
    that he would definitely not offend in  the  future  and  that  he  had
    learned his lesson in prison.


51. As recorded  at  the  start  of  this  decision,  the  respondent  took
    deportation action against the appellant in  2005.   She  rejected  his
    protection claim and considered  that  his  deportation  would  not  be
    contrary to Article 8 ECHR.  Before she reached that decision, she  had
    interviewed the appellant (in connection with his asylum claim) and had
    also received a statement from the appellant's ex-wife, SD.  She stated
    that she was the Group Operations Manager for a group which operated  a
    number of  restaurants  in  the  Greater  London  area.   She  and  the
    appellant had two children together, their son OD  and  their  daughter
    SSD.  He had a good relationship with both children,  although  he  had
    left the matrimonial home in 2001, when SSD was a baby. She was  living
    in Finchley.  The flat they had owned in Camden was on the market.  She
    had visited the appellant in HMP Belmarsh once a month  and  had  taken
    the children, which was extremely  stressful.   He  had  also  been  in
    regular contact with them on the telephone. They had not visited him in
    HMP Long Lartin, which was  too  far,  particularly  in  light  of  her
    daughter suffering from  asthma  and  anaphylaxis.   They  remained  in
    contact on the telephone, although  this  was  difficult  for  OD,  who
    missed physical contact with his father.  It would not be possible  for
    SD and  the  children  to  relocate  to  Turkey  and  visits  would  be
    impossible for financial reasons.


52. Immigration Judge Haynes allowed the appellant's appeal  on  protection
    grounds in February 2006.  He did not consider Article 33(2) or section
    72 of the 2002 Act, and made no findings in relation to  the  risk  (if
    any) the appellant presented to the community of the United Kingdom.


53. On reconsideration of IJ Haynes' decision, the Asylum  and  Immigration
    Tribunal had no  hesitation  in  rejecting  the  Secretary  of  State's
    contention that IJ Haynes had erred in his assessment of  the  risk  to
    the appellant: [8].  It was also submitted by the  Secretary  of  State
    that the appellant fell to be  excluded  from  the  protection  of  the
    Refugee  Convention  under  Article  1F(b).   As  SIJ  Lane  explained,
    however, that submission was misconceived because a crime committed  in
    the UK could not fall within that provision: [10].  He noted that there
    was a better point that the respondent could have taken  but  had  not.
    That point concerned s72 of the 2002 Act, which had not been considered
    by the judge.  Given that there had been no certificate issued  by  the
    respondent, however, the judge could not be criticised for  failing  to
    take the point of his own motion: [11]-[18].  (We note that this is not
    the current state of the law - TB (Jamaica) [2008] EWCA Civ 977; [2009]
    INLR 221 and MS (Somalia) [2019] EWCA Civ 1345; [2020] QB 364  refer  -
    but nothing turns on that for present purposes.)   The  respondent  did
    not, to our knowledge, appeal against the decision of the AIT  and  the
    appellant was granted ILR as a refugee on 30 October 2006.


54. We have been unable to ascertain from the papers the  precise  date  on
    which the appellant was released from his first period in  prison.   We
    know from the RAM Board report that he was eligible  for  release  from
    December 2004.  We know that he was not released at that time, however,
    due to the pending extradition proceedings.  We note that the statement
    made by SD in connection with the  first  deportation  proceedings  was
    made on 3 August 2005, at which time he was still said  to  be  in  HMP
    Long Lartin.  He was still detained there when his appeal was heard  by
    IJ Haynes (paragraph 4.1.2 of his  determination  refers)  in  February
    2006.  OD said in his statement that his father was imprisoned when  he
    was four and released when he was about eight years old.  We  think  it
    more likely than not that he was released in the latter half  of  2006,
    when the extradition proceedings to Holland  were  discontinued.   That
    certainly chimes with the assertion made by the appellant's friend  JA,
    in his statement of 19 July 2020, that he met the appellant in 2006  or
    2007.

55. The appellant was convicted of the drugs offences on 22 May 2009.  When
    he was sentenced by HHJ Ainley on 1 June 2009, the judge noted that  he
    had spent 306 days on remand, which would count against the sentence of
    imprisonment he was required to serve.  The date of his arrest for  the
    offences is unfortunately not clear from the papers but it would appear
    to be around ten months before 1 June 2009, which would be  the  summer
    of 2008.  That chimes  with  the  Trial  Record  Sheet  for  the  drugs
    offences,  which  shows  that  he  was  sent  for  trial  from   Hendon
    Magistrates' Court on 24 July 2008.  The  later  OASys  assessment,  to
    which we will turn in due course, is clearly wrong in  suggesting  that
    the date of the drugs offence was 1 January 2009.  It appears, in  sum,
    that he was at liberty for between eighteen months and two years before
    he was arrested for the drugs offences.

56. HHJ Ainley made a Serious Crime Prevention Order.  A confiscation order
    was made at the same court in 2011.  The  appellant  was  committed  to
    prison for five years in default of payment in 2012.  We will return in
    due course to the significance of each.

57. It is clear that the appellant did not sit idly in prison.  Pages 16 to
    58 of the bundle prepared for this hearing contain a  great  number  of
    certificates and other documents.  Some of those merely reflect that he
    tested negative for prohibited substances.  (We say  'merely'  because,
    as already noted, there has never been any suggestion  that  he  has  a
    difficulty with substance abuse but drugtaking abounds in prison and it
    is to the appellant's credit that he avoided its  temptations.)   Other
    documents reflect the work he undertook to  improve  his  numeracy  and
    literacy and to obtain the vocational qualifications  he  described  in
    his evidence, in fields such as cleaning, food safety and constructions
    skills.   In  the  latter  connection,  we  also  note  that   he   was
    complimented by a senior civil servant for his enthusiasm and hard work
    during a visit she paid to HMP High Down on 25 February 2010.  We  also
    note the courses he undertook on Pro-Social Modelling in October  2017,
    during which he remained well  motivated  and  focused  throughout  the
    twelve three-hour sessions.

58. On 7 February 2020, another OASys  report  was  written,  following  an
    assessment  by  a  Probation  Services  Officer  ("PSO")  named   James
    Heffernan on the same date.  It is necessary to set out this report  in
    detail, since Mr Radford relied heavily upon it in submitting that  the
    appellant posed no demonstrable  risk  to  the  community  of  the  UK,
    whereas Mr Lindsay criticised the conclusions and  the  methodology  in
    the report.

    The OASys Report
59. The author gave the appellant's address in West London and stated  that
    the purpose of the report was that the appellant had been  released  on
    licence.  Having noted basic details such as the nature  of  the  index
    offence and the date of the appellant's release (23 January  2020),  he
    undertook an Offender Group Reconviction Scale  ("OGRS  3")  assessment
    which culminated  in  a  reckoning  that  there  was  a  7%  chance  of
    reoffending within a year and a 14% chance of reoffending in  2  years.
    Given the significance which Ms Radford invited us to attach  to  those
    figures, we think it is important to understand the  statistical  basis
    upon which they were reached.  The  table  which  appears  above  those
    percentages is as follows:

60. Following the OGRS 3 analysis, there  followed  a  further  'layer'  of
    consideration, which began with brief details of the  offence,  in  the
    following terms:


         [The appellant] appeared at Croydon Crown Court  on  the  1st  June
         2009 for sentence following his guilty pleas to three counts, on  a
         nine count indictment.  The remaining six counts  were  ordered  to
         remain on file not to proceed without leave of the court.  On count
         (4) The importation of Class A drugs he received a sentence  of  14
         years' imprisonment.  On count (7) Conspiracy to supply  class  (A)
         drugs (Heroin) he received a sentence of  13  years'  imprisonment.
         On count (9) Importation of class (A) drugs he received a  sentence
         of 18 years' imprisonment.


         The court also ordered that [the appellant] would be the subject of
         a 5 year serious crime prevention order to  begin  at  his  release
         date.


         [The appellant] was convicted along with [his co-defendants] as the
         principles  [sic]  in  a  major  Heroin   importing   organisation.
         Evidence  suggests  that  [the  appellant]  was  the  head  of  the
         organisation,  with  [the  co-defendants]  as  the  next  tier   of
         management within the organisation.  The organisation  is  said  to
         have had a broad customer base with representatives in  many  areas
         of the UK.  The counts on the indictment  which  referred  to  [the
         appellant]  alone  encompassed  68.92  kilos  of  Heroin  with   an
         estimated retail value of 5.2 million GB pounds.


         A listening devise [sic] had been installed  in  [the  appellant's]
         home and recordings were made  of  him  organising  and  discussing
         matters connected to his supply chain.  Following a  drug  delivery
         intercept by police and  customs  officials,  [the  appellant]  was
         arrested at his home in Finchley.

61. Mr Heffernan then checked or left blank a number of boxes  designed  to
    inform the analysis of the index offence.  He noted that there were  no
    directly identified victims and that  the  appellant's  offences  would
    'impact on society in  general'.   It  was  noted  that  the  appellant
    understood the impact on society.  Eleven to fifteen other  individuals
    were said to have been involved and peer group influence  was  said  to
    have played a part,  although  the  appellant  was  identified  as  the
    leader.  His motivation was  stated  to  be  'purely  financial  gain'.
    Then, at 2.11, there is the following answer to a  question  about  how
    much responsibility the appellant took for his offending:


         [The appellant] accepts full responsibility  for  his  actions,  he
         explains that a co-defendant came to him for help due to him  being
         in financial difficulty however he realises he had the  opportunity
         to say no and could have opted out of helping  him  and  ultimately
         committing the offence.

62. The report noted that the appellant had previous convictions for  drink
    driving and possession of gun  in  2002.   The  index  offence  was  an
    escalation in the offending, although at 2.14, it was said  that  there
    was no established pattern  of  similar  offending.   Underneath  that,
    there is the following analysis of 'issues  contributing  to  risks  of
    offending and harm':


         [The appellant] stands convicted of being a major figure in a world
         wide conspiracy to import Class (A) drugs into the  UK.   From  the
         massive amounts of drugs involved he stood to profit in millions of
         pounds GB.  His earlier  offences  relations  to  firearms  are  an
         indication of the violence that can be  involved  within  the  drug
         trade.

63. Mr Heffernan there concluded that  the  analysis  of  the  offence  was
    linked to a risk of serious harm, risks to  the  individual  and  other
    risks.  He then moved on to analysis of the appellant's  accommodation,
    noting at the outset what had been said in previous reports.   He  then
    noted that he had  visited  the  appellant's  new  accommodation  on  5
    February 2020 and that it had been provided by a friend  (MT)  free  of
    charge.  He was shown a tenancy  agreement  which  confirmed  that  the
    appellant could live at the property with no deposit and no rent.   The
    property was likened to  a  'nice  hotel  room'  which  had  a  private
    bathroom  and  a  shared   kitchen.    Mr   Heffernan   assessed   that
    accommodation was not linked to a risk of serious harm ("RoSH"),  risks
    to the individual or other risks or offending behaviour.


64. In considering the next part of the assessment  -  Education,  Training
    and Employability - the author of the report assessed there to be 'some
    problems' in relation to  the  appellant's  employment  history,  work-
    related skills and school attendance but no problems in relation to his
    attitude  to  employment,  reading  writing   or   numeracy,   learning
    difficulties or his attitude to education and training.   There is then
    a section in the following terms:


         [The appellant] states that between the age of 7 and  12  years  of
         age he attended school in Turkey on a mornings or  afternoons  only
         basis, and at that early age he had begun to work on  a  part  time
         basis in order to make a contribution to the family income. At  the
         age of 14 he left secondary education due  to  family  pressure  to
         take up full time employment, this he states was a normal thing  to
         do in the  Turkish  culture.   [The  appellant]  was  always  self-
         employed trading in various goods, and eventually opening  his  own
         retail business in Turkey. Members of his family became involved in
         the political scene in Turkey and they became under pressure from a
         Kurdish  fraction  as  well  as  government   agents.   When   [the
         appellant's] brother was murdered by what he describes  as  Kurdish
         terrorists, he moved to the UK and applied for political asylum.


         [The appellant] stated that he believed that  he  was  still  under
         threat while living in  the  UK  from  the  Kurdish  people  so  he
         procured himself a firearm and ammunition for self-protection, this
         resulted in his arrest and his first  jail  sentence.   On  release
         from prison he had no visible means of support, and claims that  he
         was receiving financial help from family and  friends.  It  was  at
         this time that the appellant became of interest to  the  police  in
         relation to his involvement in drug trafficking which culminated in
         his current 18 year prison sentence. While  serving  this  sentence
         the appellant is undertaking an extensive training programme at NVQ
         level in restaurant operation and management, as a possible  avenue
         of employment when released. [The appellant] has also improved  his
         ability to communicate both orally and in writing in  both  English
         and Turkish, and his standard of comprehension is at a level  which
         permits him  to  engage  in  both  educational  and  rehabilitative
         programmes. [The appellant] states that his wife has  a  number  of
         cosmetics retail outlets in various shopping precincts  and  malls,
         so there is no immediate need for him to rush  into  employment  on
         release.


         Review 15/12/2015 - [the  appellant]  is  currently  in  full  time
         employment at HMP Lowdham Grange as the reception orderly.  He  has
         many  positive  case  notes  relating  to  his  work  in  reception
         regarding his level of hard work and respectfulness to staff.  [The
         appellant] is also a buddy on the wing, supporting other  prisoners
         when they need it.


         Current OASys
         [The appellant's] immigration status does not allow  him  to  work,
         study or have access to public funds. During a H/V appointment with
         [the appellant] on 5/2/20 he did say that he  would  like  to  find
         employment as he likes to keep busy but he will have to wait on the
         decision of the Home Office as to whether or not he is  allowed  to
         remain in the UK.


         Assessment
         ETE is linked to a RoSH, risks to the individual  and  other  risks
         and offending behaviour.

65. Financial Management and Income is the  next  section  of  the  report.
    There were thought to be 'some problems' in relation to the appellant's
    financial  situation,  financial  management   and   over-reliance   on
    family/friends and 'significant problems' related to  illegal  earnings
    as a source of income.  There were no problems  noted  in  relation  to
    budgeting.  There was then the following:


         Previous OASys
         [The appellant] states that both he and his wife have  always  been
         self-employed. His wife is the proprietor of  a  number  of  retail
         cosmetic outlets in various shopping precincts  and  malls  in  the
         Greater London area, and that he traded in various  goods.  At  the
         time of his arrest [the appellant] claims that he was entering into
         a business arrangement with  two  others  to  set  up  and  operate
         restaurant business, but his  arrest  brought  this  venture  to  a
         close.


         [The appellant's] index offences show that he was also involved  in
         a major drug trafficking conspiracy which involved  the  import  of
         large quantities of illegal drugs into the UK from various areas of
         the world, a project which  generated  vast  sums  of  illegal  and
         unaccountable money.


         [The  appellant]  has  been   given   a   confiscation   order   of
         approximately 1.6 million with interest, he states he has no way of
         paying this money as he simply does not have the funds and this  is
         something he is  trying  to  sort  out  with  his  solicitor.  [The
         appellant] states his previous solicitor withdrew  from  this  case
         due to  issues  over  funding,  he  is  currently  researching  the
         possibility of bankruptcy as he still  states  he  cannot  pay  his
         confiscation order.


         Review 15/12/2015 - [the appellant's]  confiscation  order  remains
         unpaid and the appellant is not in a  position  to  pay  this  back
         currently. He states  in  custody  he  feels  he  is  managing  his
         finances okay with the income he receives from his  employment  and
         occasional money sent in from family on special occasions.  I  have
         changed section 5.4 from some problems to no problems as  there  is
         no current evidence in custody that the appellant  obtains  illegal
         earnings as a source of income.


         Current OASys
         [The appellant] states that his confiscation order has now risen to
         2.2 million and as previously stated he has no  means  to  pay  for
         this. He adds that he received an additional 5 year custodial  term
         for  non-payment  of  confiscation  order.  Having  met  with   the
         appellant for a H/V on 5/2/20, I  can  see  that  his  friends  are
         helping  him  out  financially,  free   accommodation,   they   are
         supporting his travel and food costs. When I met with  him  he  was
         dressed in nice attire and his room  was  recently  decorated  with
         brand new furnishings.


         Immigration status means that Mr Denman  is  not  allowed  to  work
         study or have access to public funds so he is completely reliant on
         his partner and friends providing him with financial support.


         Assessment
         Financial issues are linked to a RoSH, risks to the individual  and
         other risks and offending.

66. Section 6 concerned relationships.  It was noted that the appellant had
    parental  responsibilities  and  that  he  was  in   a   non-cohabiting
    relationship.   There  were  thought  to  be  some  problems  with  his
    childhood, his relationships with his  family  and  with  his  previous
    experience of close relationships.  We need not set out  all  the  text
    which appears beneath those sections.  It suffices to  state  that  the
    report repeats the account of the appellant's  relationships  with  his
    children and with TC which we have set out above.   Relationships  were
    not thought to be a contributory factor to the risk assessment.


67. Section 7 concerned Lifestyle and  Associates.   It  was  thought  that
    there were some problems in three area:  regular  activities  encourage
    offending, easily influenced by criminal  associates  and  recklessness
    and risk-taking behaviour.  The section which appears underneath is  as
    follows:


         Previous OASys
         [The appellant's] involvement in international drug trafficking and
         his regular interaction with his co-defendants and others  in  this
         venture, is an indicator of the criminal lifestyle that he chose to
         undertake. His previous offences which involved the  possession  of
         illegal firearms and ammunition is  a  further  indication  of  the
         criminal lifestyle and the associated  dangers  that  he  regularly
         undertook in the pursuit of vast financial  gain.  [The  appellant]
         explained that a co-defendant came to him asking for his help as he
         was in debt and this is how he became involved in drug  trafficking
         in an attempt to help pay the back the debt. [The appellant]  takes
         full responsibility for the offence and  explained  that  he  could
         have said no at any point but chose not to. [The  appellant]  tends
         to spend his time in custody around more pro-social  prisoners  and
         doesn't get involved  in  issues  that  don't  concern  himself  or
         problematic behaviour


         Review 15/12/2015 - [the appellant]  spends  his  time  in  custody
         constructively, working full time and being a  Buddy  on  the  wing
         supporting   others.   [The   appellant]   continues   to    accept
         responsibility  for  the  offence  and  does   not   minimise   his
         involvement. There is no evidence in  custody  currently  that  the
         appellant engages in regular activities to encourage  offending  or
         displays reckless behaviour. Based on  this  I  have  changed  both
         sections to no problems. [The appellant] has remained  adjudication
         free since 2009 and  has  positive  relationships  with  staff  and
         prisoners.


         Current OASys
         During a H/V on 05/02/2020 [the appellant] has informed me that  he
         is keeping himself to himself and has only a very close  circle  of
         friends and family that he trusts and socialises with.  I  explored
         the fact that as he was a ringleader in the index offence and given
         the nature of it there must be  individuals  (negative  peers)  who
         would wish to re acquaint with him, the appellant stated  that  the
         drug supply chain would have changed during the 11  years  that  he
         was in custody and as such there would be totally different players
         who are involved in this type of offending.


         Assessment
         I assesses [sic] that lifestyle and associates are linked to a RoSH
         , risks to the individual, other risks and  offending.  I  find  it
         difficult to believe that the  appellant  will  not  contact  those
         individuals who were linked to his index  offence  given  the  high
         value of the imported drugs.

68. Drug misuse was considered at section  8,  and  no  issues  of  concern
    arose; the appellant had occasionally taken drugs in the  distant  past
    but had not consumed any since the 1990s.  Drugs  were  not  linked  to
    risk.  Given the appellant's conviction  for  drink  driving  in  1998,
    however, some concern was expressed at section 9 about  alcohol  misuse
    in the past.  Section 10 concerned emotional well-being.   No  problems
    were noted in this respect; issues with depression had  been  addressed
    in previous years; the appellant  did  not  feel  that  there  was  any
    concern; he  came  across  as  a  very  confident  individual  who  had
    integrated into the community very well.


69. At section 11, there were certain  problems  noted  with  thinking  and
    behaviour.  Mr Heffernan's assessment was follows:

         Previous OASys
         In  interview  [the  appellant]  came   across   as   taking   full
         responsibility for his offence and was open and  honest  in  saying
         that he was the senior player in the operation. He states how a co-
         defendant came to him for help as he was in trouble with a group of
         individuals for a drug debt however he was not passing the blame as
         he understands he could and should have said no.


         08/12/2014 Review - [the appellant] has been given  the  pro-social
         modelling course as a sentence plan target to broaden his knowledge
         on thinking skills and anti-social behaviour which includes  victim
         awareness and drug trafficking.


         15/12/2015  Review  -  [the  appellant]  demonstrates   appropriate
         interpersonal skills for his age and always engages very well  when
         having offender supervisor contact. He demonstrates  no  aggressive
         behaviour and feels he understands people's views adequately.  [The
         appellant] is adhering to his sentence plan by completing his maths
         and English level 2 however he still needs  to  complete  the  pro-
         social modelling course before the end of his sentence.


         Current OASys
         Having met with [the appellant] for a H/V on  05/02/2020  he  is  a
         very polite individual who I am sure given his background knows the
         system well enough to provide textbook  answers  to  questions.  He
         came across as very reflective on the mistakes of the  past  taking
         full ownership and responsibility for his  offences  and  commented
         that he would never go back to offending but I am not sure if  this
         was "lip service".


         Assessment
         Thinking and  behaviour  or  linked  to  a  RoSH  ,  risks  to  the
         individual, other risks and offending.

70. The final part of this section of the report on which we must dwell  at
    some length is number 12 - attitudes.  It was noted that the  appellant
    was quite motivated to address his offending behaviour, that there were
    'no problems in several respects and 'some problems in relation to  his
    attitude towards community and society.  Mr Heffernan then wrote:


         Previous OASys
         [The appellant] currently portrays an  attitude  of  contrition  in
         relation to his offending. There is  however  evidence  to  support
         that at the time of  his  offending  he  was  part  of  a  criminal
         subculture that showed  indifference  to  acceptable  standards  of
         behaviour. [The appellant] says that he felt abandoned when he  was
         released from his previous prison sentence, and that he  turned  to
         people he knew for help and support, these people were  family  and
         friends.


         Review 21/08/2018 - [the appellant] explained in interview that the
         reason for carrying the firearm for the previous offence  was  that
         at the time he was not accustomed to British culture and he did not
         go to the police when he was under threat,  he  dealt  with  issues
         himself he said he now realises this was the wrong thing  to  do  -
         [the appellant] must take responsibility for his  actions  he  knew
         that carrying a firearm without a certificate is an illegal offence
         whether used to British culture or not.


         Review 08/12/14 - no change in circumstance.


         Review 15/12/2015 -  no  change  to  the  above  information.  [The
         appellant] interacts very well with staff and other  prisoners  and
         demonstrated an understanding of why he offended.  [The  appellant]
         remains motivated to address aspects of his offending and currently
         shows no signs of pro-criminal attitudes within custody therefore I
         have changed section 12.1 to no problems.


         Current OASys
         Having met with [the appellant] for a H/V on  05/02/2020  he  is  a
         very polite individual who I am sure given his background knows the
         system well enough to provide textbook  answers  to  questions.  He
         came across as very reflective on the  mistakes  of  the  past  and
         commented that he would never go back to offending but I'm not sure
         if this was "lip service."


         Assessment
         Based on previous offences I would have  to  assess  attitudes  are
         linked to a   RoSH,  risks  to  the  individual,  other  risks  and
         offending.

71.  No  concerns  were  expressed  in  relation   to   health   or   other
    considerations at  section  13,  and  the  appellant's  self-assessment
    indicated on page 29 of the form that he had no problems in any of  the
    27 respects listed and that he was 'definitely not' likely to offend in
    the future because he had learned his lesson.


72. These elements of the analysis (and further checked boxes) were carried
    forward into the OASys Violence Predictor (OVP) score, which was  4% in
    the first year and 7% in the  second  year,  resulting  in  an  overall
    assessment that the risk of violent offending was low.

73. At p35 of the report, Mr Heffernan undertook a  full  analysis  of  the
    risk of serious harm to others.  The aim, as stated in  the  rubric  of
    the report was 'to use all information to assess whether  the  offender
    was  likely  to  cause  serious  harm'.   The  offence   details   were
    (understandably) copied from an earlier  section  of  the  report.   He
    noted that the appellant had been convicted of the importation of large
    quantities of class A drugs via various ports; that there was  evidence
    of sophisticated planning to avoid detection; and that drug  users  and
    members of the public were the victims of the offending.  This was said
    to be a 'major conspiracy involving some thirteen or more conspirators'
    which was motivated by financial gain.  Mr Heffernan noted that he  had
    the  previous  OASys  and  a  previous  interview  with  the  appellant
    available to him but that he had no current CPS  documentation.   There
    was then  reference  to  the  historical  drink  driving  and  firearms
    offences.

74. The report stated that there was no  risk  to  children  and  that  the
    appellant presented no risk of  self  harm  or  suicide,  despite  such
    concerns having been  noted  in  the  past.   There  were  no  concerns
    regarding escaping or absconding, a  previous  alert  having  been  de-
    activated in August  2010.  There  were  no  issues  about  controlling
    behaviour or breach of trust.

75. At p43 of the report, Mr Heffernan noted that the risks associated with
    the appellant's previous offending included physical harm from the  use
    of firearms and 'Large quantities of class A drugs entering the streets
    with Cities throughout the UK and the knock on effect such  drugs  have
    on society.  These risks were thought to be at their greatest

         if [the appellant] becomes  financially  unstable  and  associating
         with criminal peers.  [the appellant] is currently in the community
         being financially supported by his partner and close friends.

76. The circumstances which were likely to increase risk were  said  to  be
    'future involvement in organised crime, association with criminal peers
    and being unemployed or financially  unstable.   Full-time  employment,
    financial stability, a good support network and  using  skills  learned
    from the pro-social modelling course were factors which were thought to
    reduce the risk.  There then  followed  an  important  section  of  the
    report, much of which we must reproduce in full:


         Custody
         Assess the risk of serious harm the offender  poses  on  the  basis
         that they could be released imminently back into the community. The
         length of the sentence left to serve is not relevant to  completion
         of this section. Assess both the risk of serious harm the  offender
         presents now , in custody, and  the  risk  they  could  present  to
         others whilst in a custodial setting.


         Low risk of serious harm  -  current  evidence  does  not  indicate
         likelihood of serious harm.


         Medium risk of serious harm - there are identifiable indicators  of
         risk of serious harm. The  offender  has  the  potential  to  cause
         serious harm but is unlikely to do so unless there is a  change  in
         circumstances, for example, failure to  take  medication,  loss  of
         accommodation,  relationship  breakdown,  drug  or  alcohol  misuse
         growth.


         High risk of serious harm - there are  identifiable  indicators  of
         risk of serious harm. The potential event could happen  at  anytime
         and the impact would be serious.


         Very high risk of serious harm -  there  is  an  imminent  risk  of
         serious harm. The potential event is more likely than not to happen
         imminently and the impact would be serious.


         Where an individual is assessed as being at  medium  high  or  very
         high risk of serious harm, this MUST be  followed  through  with  a
         risk management plan.


      |Risk            |Risk in Community   |Risk in       |
|                |                    |Custody       |
|Children        |Low                 |Low           |
|Public          |Medium              |Low           |
|Known adult     |Low                 |Low           |
|Staff           |Low                 |Low           |
|Prisoners       |-                   |Low           |


77. At p46, amongst other things, the author noted the terms of  the  SCPO,
    which  restrict  possession  of  cash  (to  �1000,  including  combined
    currencies) and communication devices  and  require  the  appellant  to
    notify the details of any telephones or vehicles under his control.  He
    is also required to notify  his  address.   In  addition,  his  licence
    requires that he is not to contact or associate with his  co-defendants
    without the prior approval of his supervising officer and he is not  to
    own or possess more than one mobile phone or SIM card  without  similar
    approval.  The details of  any  mobile  phone  or  SIM  card  owned  or
    possessed by the appellant  are  to  be  notified  to  his  supervising
    officer.  The OGRS, OGP and OVP scores were given again,  showing  that
    the appellant was 'low' in each case.  He was said to be a medium  risk
    of serious harm to the public but low in all other  areas.   Compliance
    and risk were to  be  monitored  by  the  National  Crime  Agency,  the
    Offender Manager  ("OM")  and  the  immigration  authorities.   He  was
    required to report to the OM every two weeks.


78. At p49, there was a tabular 'Criminogenic  Needs  Summary  and  Section
    Scores' which we have considered but  need  not  reproduce.   Page  50,
    however, contains a table which draws together the Weighted Scores  for
    the OGP and the OVP.  Although neither advocate referred to  this  part
    of the report, we should reproduce it in full[2]:

79. On the following page, it was noted that the appellant  had  identifies
    no issues in his self-assessment and that he was 'quite  motivated'  to
    address offending and that he was 'quite capable' to change and  reduce
    offending.  He was said to  be  very  reflective  and  to  accept  full
    responsibility for his offences.  A factor that  might  inhibit  change
    was said to be future involvement in organised crime and  re-engagement
    with  negative  peers.   The  positive  factors  noted  above  (regular
    employment etc) were thought to be positive factors to be maintained or
    developed.


80. On p52. The Offender Objectives were given, and it was  said  that  the
    development or cognitive and employment skills was ongoing, as was  the
    management  of  personal  relationships.    An   NVQ   programme,   and
    adjudication free sentence and the maintenance of the  enhanced  regime
    were all fully achieved.  Contact details for officers in the  National
    Crime Agency and the National Probation Service were given. The  report
    was then countersigned by a supervisor; the 'Skills Checker' at the end
    being left blank.

81. In addition to the OASys assessment and the evidence of the appellant's
    activities in prison, we have a range of evidence from people with whom
    he has  associated  since  release.   We  have  already  described  the
    evidence given by his family members and his partner.  There  are  also
    statements from individuals who did not attend to  give  oral  evidence
    before us.

82. The appellant's daughter is a student at the University of  Nottingham.
    She has a good relationship  with  him  and  has  remained  in  regular
    contact with him.  Like her brother, she stopped visiting him when  she
    was taking her A-Levels.  She had also seen  him  in  between  his  two
    terms of imprisonment.  She had tested positive for  Covid-19  and  had
    isolated so she had kept in contact with him over the  telephone.   She
    thought it 'completely unlikely' that the appellant would re-offend  as
    there was too much at stake for him.  She  said  that  it  would  be  a
    personal affront to her and her brother  and  would  put  the  latter's
    career in sport in jeopardy.  She thought  that  he  was  a  much  more
    mature and optimistic person.

83. Statements were also given by JA, MH and  MHK,  all  of  whom  are  the
    appellant's friends.  Each had known him since before he was imprisoned
    for  the  drugs  offences.   They  provided  him   with   support   and
    companionship  and  they  were  all  of  the  view  that  he  had  been
    rehabilitated.   MH,  in  particular,  emphasised  the  great  personal
    kindness that the appellant had shown him over the years.   MHK  stated
    that he had also been a positive influence on her son.


84. Having summarised the evidence before us,  we  turn  to  our  analysis,
    taking all of the above into account.


85. There are a number of statements from family and friends which  support
    the  appellant's  account  that  he  has  firmly  turned  his  back  on
    criminality.   We  attach  some  weight  to  those   assessments,   and
    particularly to the views  expressed  by  TC.   She  is  not  only  the
    appellant's current partner, who spends a good deal of  time  with  him
    (although they do not presently cohabit);  she  is  also  an  ex-prison
    officer, and we accept  both  the  honesty  of  her  evidence  and  her
    assertion that she has experience which is relevant  to  the  view  she
    holds about the appellant's rehabilitation.  That  said,  we  note  and
    accept the submission made by Mr Lindsay about the appellant's  ability
    in the past to keep those close to him completely in the dark about his
    offending.  We were struck, in that connection, by his son's  statement
    that he only found out about the scope of his father's offending during
    the hearing before us.

86. It was on the professional  assessments  of  risk  that  the  advocates
    understandably focused, however, and we were invited  to  consider  the
    OASys report in some detail.  Before we come to that, we return to  the
    significance of the SCPO,  the  Ft-T's  one-sided  treatment  of  which
    caused us to conclude that it had erred in law.  On any proper view, it
    is a significant matter that the sentencing judge, who had  conduct  of
    this complex case (involving 121 witnesses for the prosecution and 7341
    pages of evidence) between October 2008 and November 2009, saw  fit  to
    pass a Serious Crime Prevention Order.  He did so under s19(2)  of  the
    Serious Crime Act 2007, which required him  to  be  satisfied,  amongst
    other things, that there were reasonable grounds to  believe  that  the
    order would protect the public by preventing, restricting or disrupting
    involvement in serious crime. The maximum term of  any  such  order  is
    five years (s16 refers), and it is also  significant  that  HHJ  Ainley
    chose to impose an order of the maximum length, which applied from  the
    date of each defendants' release.  In making any such order, the  court
    is concerned with future risk and the  court  must  be  satisfied  that
    there is a real or significant risk, and not a bare  possibility,  that
    the defendant will commit further serious offences: R v Hancox [2010] 1
    WLR 1434, at [9].  Judge Ainley, who was uniquely well-placed to assess
    the need for a SCPO at the end of  the  appellant's  sentence,  clearly
    considered that there was a real or significant risk  of  him  becoming
    involved in further serious offences upon  release.   That  assessment,
    undertaken at the point of sentence in June 2009, continues to form the
    backdrop to the assessment we must undertake in this appeal.

87. A breach of a SCPO is a criminal offence carrying imprisonment of up to
    five years: section 25 of the Serious Crime Act 2007 refers.  We accept
    that the appellant is subject to strict monitoring under the  terms  of
    that order, which continues for the foreseeable future.  Like the judge
    in the Ft-T, we accept that the existence of the order, the  monitoring
    which takes place pursuant to it, and  the  possibility  of  a  further
    sentence of imprisonment  for  a  breach  all  operate  to  reduce  the
    likelihood of the appellant committing further offences.   The  purpose
    of the order is to reduce risk and we accept that it does so.

88. We turn, therefore, to the OASys report, upon which Ms  Radford  placed
    significant reliance in support of her submission  that  the  appellant
    had rebutted the presumption of danger to the  community  in  s72.   We
    treat  that  report  as  expert  evidence,  given  the  expertise   and
    impartiality of the officers of  Her  Majesty's  Prison  and  Probation
    Service.  It is nevertheless well established that we are not bound  by
    the conclusions of such a report.   The  weight  to  be  given  to  any
    evidence, including expert evidence, is a matter for  the  tribunal  of
    fact, which is obliged to approach that evidence with appropriate  care
    and to give good reasons for reaching a conclusion contrary to that  of
    the expert: SS (Sri Lanka) [2012] EWCA Civ 155, at  [21],  per  Stanley
    Burnton LJ (with whom Lewison and Maurice Kay LJJ agreed).  In relation
    to reports of this specific nature, we also note the body of  authority
    in criminal law in which it is emphasised that a sentencer is  entitled
    to reject a  suitably  qualified  expert's  report  tending  towards  a
    conclusion that a defendant is not dangerous,  providing  he  considers
    all the circumstances of the case and explains his  reasons  for  doing
    so: R v Rocha [2007] EWCA Crim 1505 and R v S & Ors  [2005]  EWCA  Crim
    3616; [2006] 2 Cr App R (S) 35.


89. We can deal fairly briefly with Ms Radford's reliance on  the  Offender
    Group Reconviction Scale assessment that the appellant  presents  a  7%
    risk of reoffending in the first year after release  and  14%  risk  of
    reoffending in the second year.  It is important to understand the  way
    in which these percentages are calculated,  which  is  clear  from  the
    report itself.   The calculation  is  algorithmic,  and  based  on  the
    numbers entered in the seven boxes.   (We  have  reproduced  the  whole
    table at [59] above.)  Where, as here, the numbers show that  a  person
    does not have a pattern of convictions or court appearances,  the  OGRS
    assessment suggests that the individual has a low risk of reconviction.
     There is a reason that the OGRS assessment features at an early  stage
    of the OASys report; it is a starting point, a 'ready  reckoner'  which
    is based  on  statistical  research.   There  is  no  scope  for  human
    consideration, however, and no  scope  (in  cases  where  there  is  no
    history of sexual or violent offending) for the officer to consider the
    nature of the offending.  Because he was first in trouble at the age of
    thirty and has only two convictions, he was placed at a  low  point  on
    the scale.  As far as the OGRS  was  concerned,  there  were  no  other
    matters which suggested a risk of  reconviction,  since  the  appellant
    scored zero  in  every  other  category.   Obviously,  however,  it  is
    necessary to consider all the circumstances of the case in coming to  a
    conclusion on risk, and we do not consider that the low  score  on  the
    OGRS bears the weight which Ms Radford invited us to attach to it.


90. Of greater significance is the overall evaluation of risk undertaken by
    Mr Heffernan (and approved by his supervisor) over the remaining  pages
    of the report.  We have endeavoured to provide  a  fulsome  summary  of
    that analysis, and have considered the whole of the report  with  great
    care in coming to our conclusions.  Having done so,  we  consider  that
    there are a number of difficulties with the appellant's  evidence,  and
    with the reasoning in the OASys report, which cause us  not  to  accept
    the conclusion that he presents only a low risk of reoffending.

91. We do not consider the appellant to have been at all frank with us - or
    with the author of the OASys report - about his history.  He maintained
    in his evidence that he had become involved in the heroin  trade  after
    being released from prison for two reasons.  He said, firstly, that  he
    had felt abandoned by the authorities when he  was  released  into  the
    community without support and that he had turned to  his  friends.   He
    said, secondly, that a friend had asked him for help with some debt and
    he had decided to become involved in  the  heroin  trade  in  order  to
    assist this person.  These explanations overlook both  the  appellant's
    past and the position he held when he  was  arrested.   He  received  a
    conviction for being in possession of a loaded weapon a few years after
    he arrived in the United Kingdom,  and  was  implicated  by  the  Dutch
    authorities with the heroin trade in that country.  His conviction  for
    the firearms offence plainly shows that he had connections  which  most
    people do not have; at the very least, he had channels through which he
    could obtain such things.


92. As we have explained above, something between one and two years  passed
    between the appellant's release from prison  and  his  arrest  for  the
    drugs offences.  His son recalled barely any time passing  between  his
    release and his return to prison.  It is frankly absurd to maintain, as
    he has throughout, that he had  no  involvement  in  the  heroin  trade
    before his  conviction  for  the  firearms  offence.   To  accept  that
    assertion would require us to  accept  that  a  man  with  no  previous
    involvement could rise to the very top of the heroin trade  in  the  UK
    within eighteen months.  The obvious  reality,  instead,  is  that  the
    appellant was  already  involved  in  criminality  when  his  flat  was
    searched in 2002 and that he returned to  that  world  -  as  a  senior
    figure - as soon as he was released from prison.   Were  that  not  the
    case, the appellant would not have had the national  and  international
    connections which  he  relied  upon  to  import  and  distribute  large
    quantities of heroin.  We are unable to accept that connections of that
    nature can be established from scratch within around  eighteen  months.
    We do not accept that he fell into the heroin trade for either  of  the
    reasons he gave in evidence and to the author of the OASys report,  and
    we consider it more likely than not that he had worked his way  to  the
    top of the organisation, having reached a rung near  the  top  of  that
    ladder before his first period of imprisonment.

93. Nor do we consider the appellant to have been truthful about his income
    from his involvement in the heroin trade.  We  were  surprised  by  his
    evidence before us that he had been unable to  pay  very  much  of  the
    confiscation order which was  made  against  him  because  he  had  not
    undertaken  any  heroin  transactions  before  he  was  arrested.   The
    description of the facts in the OASys  report  and  in  Judge  Ainley's
    sentencing remarks suggests quite clearly that  the  appellant  had  in
    place a nationwide network of recipients for the heroin  which  he  was
    importing.   We  do  not  accept  that  there  had  been  no   previous
    transactions through this network.  Just as he did with regard  to  his
    history,  the  appellant  was  clearly  attempting  to   minimise   his
    involvement in the offending by giving this evidence to us.


94. We are also concerned that there is no documentary evidence  before  us
    about the making of the confiscation order at Croydon  Crown  Court  in
    February 2011.  We note that the heroin with which  the  appellant  was
    personally associated had a street value of �5.2 million but  that  the
    confiscation order which was imposed was in the sum  of  �1.3  million.
    We do not know how that sum was  arrived  at.   We  do  not  know,  for
    example, whether the appellant was found to have a criminal  lifestyle.
    Nor do we know whether any assessment was undertaken of the  amount  of
    benefit he was thought to have received from his criminal  conduct,  or
    whether the sum was based on an assumption which the court was required
    to adopt as a result of the statutory scheme in Part 2 of the  Proceeds
    of Crime Act 2002.  Nor do  we  know  why  the  sentence  specified  in
    default of payment was 5 years, when the maximum period, under  s35(2A)
    of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, was 14 years.

95. Equally, we have no documentary evidence about  the  decision  made  by
    Westminster Magistrates Court to commit  the  appellant  to  prison  in
    default of payment in January 2012.  The process, under s35(2)  of  the
    2002 Act, is that an order made under POCA 2002 is treated  as  a  fine
    for enforcement purposes.  Where a defendant defaults, therefore, he is
    summonsed to attend the Magistrates' Court, which must  decide  whether
    to commit him to prison: s76 of the Magistrates' Court Act 1980 refers.
     We note that a line  of  authority,  culminating  in  R  (Sanghera)  v
    Birmingham Magistrates' Court [2017] EWHC 3323 (Admin), has  emphasised
    the requirement (in s82 of the MCA 1980) that the  default  is  due  to
    'the  offender's  wilful  refusal  or  culpable  neglect'  and  that  a
    committal decision might properly be overturned (as it was in Sanghera)
    where no finding of wilful refusal or culpable neglect has  been  made.
    Such a finding must have been made, therefore,  in  the  case  of  this
    appellant.  As with the confiscation proceedings in  the  Crown  Court,
    however, we have been provided with no information about the  committal
    proceedings.

96. We were told by Ms Radford at the start of the  hearing  that,  despite
    our statement (at [98] of our first decision) that we were particularly
    concerned about the confiscation order and the decision to  commit  the
    appellant to prison, he had been unable to obtain  any  evidence  about
    these proceedings.  We obviously accept that the appellant has provided
    no evidence to his immigration solicitors.  We do not  accept  that  he
    was  unable  to  obtain  any  relevant  material  from   his   criminal
    solicitors, however.  It became clear during the course of his evidence
    that he continues to take advice from BSB Solicitors of London NW1.  He
    stated that he is  in  the  process  of  taking  their  advice  on  the
    possibility of applying for a 'certificate of adequacy', which we  take
    to be a reference to a certificate of inadequacy,  under  s23  of  POCA
    2002.  He was able to tell us that the partner who had represented  him
    in the Crown Court at Croydon had  retired  to  Puerto  Rico  but  that
    another partner  was  assisting  him.   It  is  inconceivable,  in  the
    circumstances  described,  that  the  appellant  would  not  have   had
    available to him the answers to the numerous questions we  have  raised
    above.  As we have  recorded,  we  canvassed  these  concerns  with  Ms
    Radford at the start of the hearing.  She  was  able  to  provide  some
    assistance on the statutory framework but she made  no  application  to
    adjourn to gather  any  further  information.   We  consider  that  the
    appellant has chosen not  to  disclose  anything  in  relation  to  the
    confiscation or  the  committal  proceedings  lest  it  undermines  his
    chances of success in this appeal.  Not only is he willing,  therefore,
    to downplay his involvement in criminality; he also chooses to  conceal
    relevant material.


97. The author of the OASys  report  wondered  whether  the  appellant  had
    genuinely reformed or whether, having been involved in the system for a
    number of years, he simply knew what to say and was paying lip  service
    to rehabilitation (page 25 of his report refers).  It seems that he was
    willing to give the appellant the benefit of the doubt in this respect.
     For the reasons we have given above, we reach the opposite conclusion.
     We formed the clear impression, as a result of the matters above, that
    the appellant attempts, when it serves his purposes, to deceive and  to
    conceal.

98. We consider Mr Lindsay to have made a sound point in  relation  to  the
    accommodation in  which  the  appellant  presently  lives.   Whilst  Mr
    Heffernan expressed concern about the  effect  of  instability  on  the
    likelihood of the appellant reoffending, he proceeded on the basis that
    the accommodation which he occupied would continue to be  available  to
    him.  Mr Lindsay pointed out that the contract by which  the  appellant
    has been provided with  a  free  room  is  unenforceable  for  want  of
    consideration.  That must be right, but it leads to a more  fundamental
    point.  Given that the appellant relies on the provision of  this  room
    as part of his submission that his life is settled and he has no reason
    to return to crime, it is concerning that there is no evidence from the
    gentleman (MT) who is said to own  the  property.   We  note  that  the
    gentleman who said that he was MT was not able to produce any  evidence
    of identity to Mr Heffernan on 5 February 2020 (page 11 of  the  report
    refers).  There is no documentary evidence before  us  to  confirm  the
    ownership of the property or to explain the basis upon which the  owner
    is willing to provide it to the appellant free of  charge.   Unlike  Mr
    Heffernan, we are not prepared to take this assertion at face value and
    we consider that his situation is rather more precarious  than  it  was
    thought to be by the author of the report.


99. Drawing these threads together, we remind ourselves that it is not  for
    the respondent to establish that the appellant presents a risk  to  the
    community of the United Kingdom.  It is, instead, for the appellant  to
    rebut the statutory presumption that he represents such a danger.   HHJ
    Ainley concluded that he would present a risk of reoffending in serious
    crime on release from prison but the SCPO he  imposed  is  designed  to
    minimise that risk.  He is thought by his family and  friends  to  have
    turned a corner in his life and to have left prison a reformed man.  He
    persuaded the author of the OASYS report that he presented a  low  risk
    of reoffending and he has certainly worked hard  in  prison  to  obtain
    qualifications and to take relevant courses.  We do not consider him to
    have told the truth about his history, however.  We do not accept  that
    he rose from the bottom to the top of an international heroin smuggling
    ring within eighteen months of his release from prison.   We  think  he
    has wilfully attempted to minimise or conceal his previous  involvement
    in that world.  Nor do we accept that he has been frank with  us  about
    his confiscation proceedings.  Nor, in light of these concerns,  do  we
    accept that we should proceed on the same basis as the  author  of  the
    OASys report in respect of the accommodation  in  which  the  appellant
    presently lives.  Having considered all of the evidence before  us,  we
    do not consider that the appellant has rebutted the presumption that he
    presents a danger to the community of the UK.  We are therefore obliged
    by statute to dismiss his appeal on asylum grounds.

Notice of Decision

We remake the decision on the appeal by finding  that  the  appellant  is  a
refoulable refugee  and  dismissing  the  appeal  on  asylum  grounds.   The
decision that his expulsion would be unlawful under  the  Human  Rights  Act
1998 stands.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms A Radford, Counsel instructed by Turpin and
                    Miller LLP (Oxford) solicitors
                            DECISION AND REASONS
    1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
       2008 we make an order prohibiting the disclosure or  publication  of
       any matter likely to lead members of  the  public  to  identify  the
       respondent (also called the claimant). Breach of this order  can  be
       punished as a contempt of court. We  make  this  order  because  the
       respondent  (claimant)  maintains  that  he  is  a  refugee  and  is
       therefore entitled to privacy.

    2. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal  allowing  the  appeal  of  the  respondent,
       hereinafter "the claimant", against a decision of the  Secretary  of
       State on 26 February 2019 to refuse him leave  to  remain  on  human
       rights grounds and to revoke his protection  status.   The  claimant
       was granted indefinite leave to remain as a refugee  on  30  October
       2006.

    3. He is also a criminal.  He has other convictions and has  previously
       defended successfully a decision to deport him but on 20 May 2009 he
       was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment, the longest being
       of eighteen years, for his part in the illegal import of heroin.  He
       was described by the sentencing judge, H H Judge Ainley, as "a  very
       major player in the heroin trade in this country".

    4. We see no need to labour the details of his crime but  we  are  very
       aware of the seriousness of the offence which is  reflected  by  the
       long sentence of imprisonment and Judge Ainley's comments.  We  also
       note when sentencing the claimant Judge Ainley indicated  that,  had
       there not been a guilty plea, he  would  have  been  thinking  of  a
       sentence imprisonment for 25 years.

    5. In 2017, the Secretary of State sought the views of the UNHCR  about
       the claimant's ongoing status as a refugee.  Having  received  those
       views, she made a number of decisions  on  26  February  2019.   She
       concluded that the circumstances in connection  with  which  he  had
       been recognized as a refugee had ceased to exist, such that  it  was
       appropriate to cease his refugee status under Article 1C(5)  of  the
       Refugee Convention.   Secondly,  she  concluded  that  even  if  the
       claimant remained a refugee, he was not protected  from  refoulement
       to Turkey because his presence in the UK constituted a danger to the
       community of this country, applying Article 33(2) of the  Convention
       and section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002
       ("the 2002 Act").  Thirdly, she  concluded  that  the  claimant  was
       excluded from Humanitarian Protection because of his conviction  for
       a serious crime, applying paragraph 339D of the  Immigration  Rules.
       Finally,  and  of  no  relevance  to  the  issues  before  us,   the
       respondent did not accept that the  claimant's  expulsion  would  be
       contrary to Article 8 ECHR because there  were  no  very  compelling
       circumstances in his case which  sufficed  to  outweigh  the  strong
       public interest in that course.

    6. As the First-tier Tribunal recognised correctly there are,  broadly,
       two ways in which a person can be deprived of refugee  status.   One
       (cessation) is when there has been a significant and durable  change
       in conditions in the country from which  the  asylum  seeker  sought
       protection  so  that  he  no  longer  needs  protection.  The  other
       (refoulement) is that although still in need  of  protection  he  is
       undeserving of, and disqualified from, the protection of the Refugee
       Convention by reason of his own bad  behaviour.   A  person  in  the
       second position may very well be able to show that removing  him  to
       the country he had escaped would be contrary  to  his  rights  under
       Article 3 of the European Convention on Human  Rights  but  in  that
       event he would enjoy fewer benefits as a person  who  could  not  be
       returned on human rights grounds than he would as a person  entitled
       to international protection as a refugee.

    7. Article 1C(5) of the 1951 Convention provides that the cessation  of
       the need for protection arises when the circumstances in  connection
       with which he has been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist.
       It is nothing to do with  the  conduct  of  the  claimant  but  with
       whether there has been such a significant and 'non-temporary' change
       in the conditions in the country of nationality  that  the  original
       fear of persecution  can  no  longer  be  regarded  as  well-founded
       (Article  11(2)  of  the  Qualification  Directive  -  2004/83/EC  -
       refers). As the UNHCR are keen to emphasise,  disqualification  from
       protection  against  refoulement  under  the   Convention   requires
       entirely different considerations. There are statutory  presumptions
       in s72 of the 2002 Act that a person who has been sentenced  to  two
       years' imprisonment has committed a particularly serious  crime  and
       is a danger  to  the  community  and  so  is  not  entitled  to  the
       protection of the Refugee Convention whether or  not  he  needs  it.
       Both presumptions are rebuttable: EN (Serbia) & KC (South Africa)  v
       SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 630; [2010] 1 QB 633.

    8. It is a feature of this case that the claimant was made the  subject
       of a Serious Crime Prevention Order as part of his  sentence.   Both
       parties regarded this as significant.  The claimant  contended  that
       it was a reason to find that he was not a danger  to  the  community
       because the community would be protected by the requirements of  the
       Serious  Crime  Prevention  Order  and  the   Secretary   of   State
       maintained, contrarily, that the claimant was clearly  a  danger  to
       the community because if he were not there would be no  need  for  a
       Serious Crime Prevention Order.

    9. It was therefore rather vexing when the appeal  came  before  us  in
       December 2019 to find that we did not have  before  us  the  Serious
       Crime Prevention Order. We were reluctant to assess  the  importance
       of a document when we do  not  know  its  terms.  We  adjourned  the
       hearing and gave directions.  A copy of the Serious Crime Prevention
       Order was provided.

   10. The claimant does  not  deny  committing  a  serious  crime  but  he
       maintains in emphatic terms that he is no longer  a  danger  to  the
       community and that he would still be at risk of persecution  in  the
       event of his return to Turkey.

   11. We note that as well  as  being  the  subject  of  a  Serious  Crime
       Prevention  Order  the  claimant  has,  or   might   have,   further
       obligations.  At paragraph 18 of the Secretary of  State's  decision
       to revoke a protection status and refuse a human rights claim we are
       told:


  "On 28 February 2011, you were made the subject of a  confiscation  order
  at Croydon Crown Court.  On 24 January 2012 at  Westminster  Magistrates'
  Court your default sentence of 1,813 days was activated in the absence of
  non-payment of the Order in full.  The serving of the sentence  does  not
  expunge the Order."

   12. Disappointingly we have not found much else about this order in  the
       papers.  We assume that there is an unintended  double  negative  in
       the Secretary of State's precis but the existence of such  an  order
       could clearly  impact  on  the  claimant's  rehabilitation  and  his
       propensity to commit further crime.  We return to that issue at  the
       end of this decision.

   13. We outline how the First-tier Tribunal made its decision.

   14. The First-tier Tribunal began, appropriately,  by  noting  that  the
       claimant was born in January 1968.  He entered  the  United  Kingdom
       clandestinely in September 1995 and claimed asylum soon  afterwards.
       He was refused asylum but granted exceptional leave to remain.

   15. In 2002 he was convicted of  possessing  a  prohibited  firearm  and
       sentenced to four years' imprisonment.  On 19 May 2004 a deportation
       order was made but he responded with further submissions  concerning
       his asylum claim and although the application  was  refused  by  the
       Secretary of State the claimant  appealed  successfully  and  on  30
       October 2006 was given indefinite leave to remain as a refugee.  Two
       years after that he was convicted of conspiracy to import and supply
       controlled substances and in February 2011  the  confiscation  order
       was made.

   16. Necessarily, the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees  was
       notified about the intention to revoke refugee  status  and  made  a
       response.

   17. The judge reviewed the evidence concerning the  seriousness  of  the
       crime and whether the claimant remains a danger  to  the  community.
       The judge relied particularly on the OASys Report.  This shows  that
       the claimant had a criminal lifestyle before being convicted of  the
       drugs offences  and  indeed  had  been  convicted  of  the  firearms
       offence.  The judge noted that the claimant had  been  described  as
       "principal in a nationwide conspiracy to import and supply  Class  A
       drugs" and that he was "a major figure in a worldwide conspiracy  to
       import Class A drugs into the  United  Kingdom".   The  same  report
       confirmed that the claimant had  accepted  full  responsibility  for
       what he had done and had used his  time  in  custody  constructively
       building positive relations with staff and fellow prisoners and that
       he showed contrition about his offending.  The report said that  the
       claimant: "Remains motivated to address aspects of his offending and
       currently shows no sign of pro-criminal attitudes within custody".

   18. It was found that the claimant had the potential  to  cause  serious
       harm but "is  unlikely  to  do  so  unless  there  is  a  change  of
       circumstances, for example, failure  to  take  medication,  loss  of
       accommodation, relationship breakdown, drug or alcohol misuse".  The
       judge  noted  that  the  report  concluded  that  the  claimant  was
       motivated to change and not to reoffend.

   19. It was the claimant's evidence that he had been in  touch  with  his
       children. His son was born in September 1998 and so is now 21  years
       old and his daughter was born in June 2001 and so is  now  18  years
       old. He took seriously their threat to disown him if he reverted  to
       criminal behaviour.  The judge said at paragraph 32:


  "However, because the OASys Report confirms what he said, I  am  prepared
  to accept that his children are  a  strong  motivation  for  him  not  to
  reoffend".

   20. The judge also accepted submissions that the claimant had "shown the
       motivation and desire to address his offending behaviour  whilst  in
       custody" and indeed the judge concluded that the claimant


  "appears to have done everything possible to demonstrate that  he  wishes
  to change his ways, and to obtain the necessary skills to do so."

   21. The next two paragraphs in the  judge's  decision  and  reasons  are
       particularly important and we set them out in their entirety:


  "39.   I also take into account that the  [claimant]  will  not  be  left
  alone to his own devices once he leaves prison.  He  will  be  under  the
  supervision of an offender manager who will agree a  plan  with  him  and
  monitor his progress.  The [claimant] is also subject to a Serious  Crime
  Prevention Order which can impose restrictions on financial, property  or
  business dealings, working arrangements, associates  and  communications,
  the use of any item, and travel both within UK and  abroad.   It  is  not
  clear from the documents before me if the terms of  the  Order  have  yet
  been decided, but the Order (which  was  made  when  the  [claimant]  was
  sentenced),  is  another  means  of  ensuring  the  [claimant]  does  not
  reoffend.  I note that the OASys Report did not seem to suggest that such
  an order was critical in ensuring the risk of reoffending is  kept  to  a
  minimum.


  40.    Having weighed all of these factors very carefully,  I  find  that
  the difficulty I am left with is weighing such  serious  criminality  and
  the possibility of the [claimant] returning to  it  because  it  was  his
  lifestyle at the time, against the [claimant's] good behaviour,  progress
  and attitude since he was sent to prison.  Ultimately, the factors I find
  that tip the balance in the [claimant's] favour are: the changes  he  has
  made and the rehabilitation he has shown have endured for  the  ten  year
  length of his sentence; that he will not be left to his  own  devices  to
  face any challenges on release from custody; and the  motivation  he  has
  shown because of his children who he will lose if he reoffends, not  only
  because of what they have said but also because  he  may  then  face  the
  possibility of removal from the country again."

   22. The judge went on to say that he concluded  for  the  reasons  given
       that the claimant had rebutted the presumption and  that  he  was  a
       danger to the community.

   23. The judge then examined the Secretary of State's assertion that  the
       claimant no longer needed protection.

   24. He began, appropriately, by considering the decision of the Tribunal
       in 2006.  There the judge found that the claimant was  a  member  of
       the PKK-Vejin faction of the Kurdistan Workers' Party  and  that  he
       was a member of a family that may well be perceived by  the  Turkish
       authorities to be associated with the PKK-Vejin faction.

   25. The First-tier Tribunal Judge then reminded himself of the  decision
       of this Tribunal in IK (returnees, records, IFA)  [2004]  UKIAT  312
       where it was accepted  that the Turkish  state  kept  extensive  and
       widely accessible manual records showing allegedly  dubious  conduct
       by its citizens, even  if  no  crime  had  been  proved,  and  which
       identified their family members:  [14]  and  [133]  of  IK  (Turkey)
       refers.

   26. The judge then directed his mind to the Secretary  of  State's  case
       and particularly the Secretary of State's  contention  supported  by
       the August 2017 Country Policy and Information Note suggesting  that
       PKK  supporters  were  now  in  a  different  and  better  position.
       According to the CPIN, prosecution  for  the  support  of  an  armed
       terrorist organisation was a possibility when justified by  evidence
       but persecution was uncommon and claims by PKK supporters  would  be
       unlikely to succeed although, obviously, each case had to be decided
       on its own facts.

   27. There was  evidence  that  prison  conditions  in  Turkey,  although
       leaving  much  to  be  desired  in  many  cases,   are   not   below
       international standards and that the claimant would be  unlikely  to
       be required to do any military service because of his age (he is now
       52).

   28. However the Secretary of State  had  invited  submissions  from  the
       UNHCR and the UNHCR did not accept that there had been a fundamental
       and durable change in Turkey so as to justify revocation  of  asylum
       status.  Particularly the UNHCR referred to a  coup  attempt  on  15
       July 2016. Since then  the  Turkish  authorities  have  "pursued  an
       unprecedented crackdown against perceived critics and opponents" and
       that the anti-terror laws were used to assist in torture  and  other
       unacceptable behaviour.

   29. The UNHCR clearly thought that conditions had  not  changed  in  the
       fundamental way  required  by  Article  1C(5)  and  that  there  was
       evidence of persecution of pro-Kurdish groups including  people  who
       were not politically active.  The closing paragraph of  the  section
       of the UNHCR letter dated 26 January 2018 (page 306 in  the  bundle)
       states:


  "In light of the above COI, UNHCR notes  that  these  concerns  underline
  that fundamental changes,  in  the  sense  of  Article  5C(5),  have  not
  occurred in Turkey. The [Secretary of State]  must  have  regard  to  the
  recent political climate in Turkey and it is evident that the persecution
  of supporters of pro-Kurdish groups, even those who are  not  politically
  active, and of those with  Kurdish  ethnicity  still  occurs  in  Turkey.
  Therefore, it is likely that [the claimant] would still  be  at  risk  of
  persecution, regardless of whether he has been politically active against
  the authorities in the UK".

   30. The Secretary of State had responded to this and had indicated  that
       members of the PKK who had  a  profile  suggesting  to  the  Turkish
       authorities that they  are  active  or  influential  may  well  risk
       persecution but persons of a low profile  or  not  active,  although
       risking harassment or discrimination, did not  generally  face  ill-
       treatment that amounted to persecution.

   31. It was the Secretary of State's position that the  claimant,  having
       left Turkey in 1995 could not be thought of as a  high  profile,  or
       indeed any kind of, activist.

   32. The claimant had produced an expert report dated 10 June  2019  from
       Ms Sheri Laizer.  Ms Laizer had  also  produced  a  report  for  the
       claimant in 2006.

   33. The judge regarded Ms Laizer as a reliable expert.  Her  report  was
       dated June 2019 and she had visited Turkey in 2017 and 2018 and  had
       observed things that reflected in her opinion.

   34. The judge summarised the expert report at paragraph 54 and we repeat
       that summary below:


  "1.    The political climate in Turkey concerning Kurds and anyone linked
  with the PKK is worse now than in 2006.  Ethnic Kurds face  higher  risks
  of adverse attention, including random  detention  and  spurious  charges
  based on their ethnicity and imputed support for the PKK.


  2. The [claimant] would face very high risks of unfair detention and ill-
  treatment.  Political files, and police records  are  not  expunged  with
  time, and the [claimant] will be known through these and therefore likely
  to come to the attention of the authorities on return.  Intelligence even
  about people even without a criminal record is  recorded  and  kept,  and
  serves as guidance to the security services.


  3. It is extremely likely that the Turkish  authorities  will  check  any
  past information held on the [claimant] and that of any known  associates
  and family members and they will profile him accordingly,  as  a  Kurdish
  draft evader who obtained refugee status in the United Kingdom.  Being of
  Kurdish ethnicity will raise the level of suspicion about the  [claimant]
  from the outset.


  4. Prison  conditions  have  deteriorated  overall  and  with  particular
  reference to the Kurdish Movement and those deemed to have links  to  the
  PKK."

   35. The judge then considered submissions and allowed the appeal.

   36. The Secretary of State's grounds of appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,
       appropriately,  attack  separately  the  decisions  concerning   the
       cessation of refugee status and the Section 72 certificate.

   37. Concerning the cessation of  refugee  status  the  grounds  complain
       that, although the judge was not wrong to  begin  with  the  earlier
       Tribunal decision that led to the claimant  getting  asylum  status,
       the appropriate starting point here was whether the  claimant  still
       needed protection.  It relied on the case of MA (Somalia)  [2019]  1
       WLR 241 approved in MS (Somalia) [2019] EWCA Civ 1345 where  Hamblen
       LJ approved Arden LJ saying:


  "A cessation decision is the  mirror  image  of  a  decision  determining
  refugee status.  By that I mean that the grounds for cessation do not  go
  beyond verifying whether the grounds for recognition  of  refugee  status
  continue to exist.  Thus, the relevant question is whether there has been
  a significant and non-temporary  change  in  circumstances  so  that  the
  circumstances which caused the person to be  a  refugee  have  ceased  to
  apply and there is no other basis on which  he  will  be  held  to  be  a
  refugee ..."

   38. It was the claimant's case that he feared not just  the  authorities
       but also the PKK which was said by the Secretary of State not to  be
       a violent organisation.  It is said  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge failed to give clear reasons why the claimant would  still  be
       at risk given that he supported a non-violent organisation  and  was
       not in a prominent  position  and  was  not  engaged  in  sur  place
       activity.  It was also the general complaint that the examination of
       the evidence of country conditions was insufficient.

   39. In his consideration of the Section  72  certificate  the  judge  is
       criticised because the claimant has, amongst  other  offences,  been
       sentenced to two substantial prison sentences so  "in  all  respects
       his offences are serious" but the First-tier Tribunal Judge did  not
       suggest otherwise and this criticism is misconceived.

   40. The grounds also complain that  a  Serious  Crime  Prevention  Order
       confirms that the claimant has the potential to cause  serious  harm
       to the public and, in any event, it only has  five  years'  duration
       and so, according to the grounds "cannot be used to rebut a  Section
       72 certificate".

   41. The grounds further maintain that the judge gave unlawful weight  to
       the allegedly improving influence of his adult children  given  that
       they did not seem to influence his behaviour when they were children
       and the judge did not explain why they should be any more  effective
       now.

   42. Ms Radford had prepared a respondent's Rule 24 response.

   43. Concerning the decision that the claimant no longer  needed  refugee
       protection she  emphasised,  correctly,  that  it  is  not  for  the
       claimant to prove that he is a refugee  but  for  the  Secretary  of
       State to prove that the cessation clauses are made out.   There  has
       to be a change of a fundamental character and the clause  is  to  be
       interpreted restrictively.

   44. Ms Radford said that the First-tier Tribunal had gone about its task
       correctly and had concluded reasonably in a fully reasoned  decision
       that the Secretary of State had not discharged the burden of proof.

   45. The Rule 24 notice reminds us that the UNHCR was not satisfied  with
       the decision of the Secretary of State and the UNHCR emphasised that
       the Turkish  authorities  had  pursued  an  unprecedented  crackdown
       against its perceived opponents after the 2016  coup  attempt.   The
       UNHCR did not accept that lack of political activity in  the  United
       Kingdom would be a saving feature.

   46. It was the Secretary of State's position that low profile  opponents
       were  not  at  risk  but  Ms  Radford  argued  that  that   was   an
       unsustainable position.  The claimant had produced an expert  report
       from Ms Laizer and the judge had rejected inferences  the  Secretary
       of State had chosen to draw  from  CPINs  and  accepted  instead  Ms
       Laizer's clear conclusions.

   47. The Rule 24 Notice also reminds us, correctly, that it  is  not  our
       function  to  decide  if  the  claimant  still  needs  international
       protection but if the Secretary of State has satisfied us  that  the
       judge was not entitled to conclude on the evidence relied upon  that
       the Secretary of State had not proved that  country  conditions  had
       changed. The grounds made  out  no  arguable  public  law  error  to
       demonstrate for example, that important documents had  been  ignored
       or that the decision to allow the appeal was irrational.

   48. With regard to the Section 72 decision the Notice again  points  out
       that the burden is on the Secretary of State to prove (on the  facts
       of this case) that the claimant cannot  be  trusted  not  to  commit
       further offences  and,  according  to  the  Notice,  the  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge was entitled to conclude  that,  notwithstanding  the
       statutory presumption, the contention that the claimant was a danger
       to the community was not made out.

   49. Ms Radford dealt with the suggestion that Decision and  Reasons  was
       unlawful because the judge did not explain why  he  found  that  the
       claimant's children would keep him out of trouble when  he  had  got
       into trouble notwithstanding his having children. She submitted that
       the omission was not important when the  Decision  was  taken  as  a
       whole.  The Decision is not  wrong  in  law  because  under  intense
       examination by a determined party some part of it is not all that it
       might be. A holistic exercise is necessary.

   50. We agree with Ms Radford about the need for a holistic approach but,
       in any event, we do not  regard  this  line  of  argument  as  being
       particularly helpful to the Secretary of State. Whatever  the  truth
       may be there is an obvious possible explanation for the  restraining
       effect of the children, namely that having been  deprived  of  close
       contact with them once he will not want to repeat the pain.  It  is,
       we find, petty and misconceived to contend that any  explanation  is
       necessary. The two sets of circumstances do not conflict.

   51. In deciding if the First-tier Tribunal was entitled to conclude that
       there had  not  been  a  necessary  change  in  circumstance  it  is
       appropriate that we consider precisely why the  claimant  was  given
       refugee status in the first place.  No explanation is offered by the
       Secretary of State because the  claimant  was  refused  asylum.  The
       reasons must lie in the decision of Mr R  J  Haynes  sitting  as  an
       Immigration Judge in February 2006.

   52. The claimant's case was summarised at paragraph 2.1.

   53. The claimant said that he risked persecution both by  the  state  of
       Turkey and by the PKK. The claimant was involved with the  Kurdistan
       Workers Party (Vejin), that is the "Vejin faction". His  cousin  was
       then serving a prison sentence of 35 years for  his  involvement  in
       the party. There was a risk of persecution by the PKK because of his
       support for the Kurdistan Workers Party.

   54. The claimant's stepbrother had been arrested and sent to prison  for
       eight years because of his involvement in the People's Revolutionary
       Freedom Movement. The claimant had travelled with his stepbrother to
       Syria where they had met the commander of a PKK camp.   That  person
       was disillusioned with the PKK and decided to set up  the  Kurdistan
       Workers Party (Vejin).  This faction of the Kurdistan Workers  Party
       was characterised by being non-confrontational and non-violent.  The
       claimant said that the existence  of  the  Kurdistan  Workers  Party
       (Vejin) was  seen  as  a  threat  to  the  PKK  and  the  claimant's
       stepbrother and sister-in-law were present at a  meeting  when  four
       PKK activists shot  and  killed  a  party  leader.   The  claimant's
       stepbrother was later shot.

   55. After the death of his stepbrother the  claimant's  nephew  returned
       from Iraq to take over his  father's  position  in  Turkey  and  was
       arrested due to  his  political  activities  including  distributing
       leaflets and attending demonstrations.

   56. The claimant was constantly harassed by the police and military.  He
       was frequently taken to the police station where  he  was  detained,
       questioned and tortured.  He  was  pressurised  to  confess  to  his
       membership of an illegal organisation, the Kurdistan  Workers  Party
       (Vejin).  Additionally, he is  under  constant  threat  by  the  PKK
       because he is seen as an enemy.   The  claimant  had  even  received
       threats from the PKK in the United Kingdom.

   57. Notwithstanding the  claimant  then  being  subject  to  deportation
       having been sentenced  to  four  years'  imprisonment  for  firearms
       offences, the Immigration Judge  was  satisfied  with  much  of  the
       claimant's evidence. In particular, there  was  background  evidence
       supporting the claimant's account of the creation of the party.

   58. The judge had studied the papers and found  that  the  claimant  had
       given a "long and uninterrupted account of his activities".

   59. The judge was impressed with  clear  background  evidence  that  the
       Turkish authorities kept extensive records.  The judge was satisfied
       that the claimant would come to the attention of the authorities and
       there was a real risk of that leading to persecution.

   60. The judge was concerned that the claimant's return from  the  United
       Kingdom would attract attention so that he would be interviewed  and
       his stay would come to light. There was but a short step  from  that
       kind of information coming out and persecution  and  the  judge  was
       satisfied there was a real risk of persecution in this case.

   61. In short, the Immigration Judge accepted that  the  claimant  was  a
       political activist  and,  importantly,  was  a  relative  and  close
       associate of more prominent activists and that he faced a real  risk
       of being identified as such by the authorities and persecuted.   The
       decision was referred to the Upper Tribunal for reconsideration  and
       was determined by Senior Immigration Judge Lane  (as  he  then  was)
       sitting with two lay members.  The Tribunal found no  fault  in  the
       Immigration Judge's decision.  The reviewing Tribunal did muse about
       how the situation might have been  different  if  the  Secretary  of
       State had chosen to rely on Section 72  of  the  2002  Act  but  the
       Secretary of State did not and so there was no need to consider then
       whether the claimant was disqualified from protection by  reason  of
       his behaviour.

   62. In the instant case the Secretary of State  had  to  show  that  the
       risks that existed when the claimant was recognised as a refugee did
       not exist now.  The First-tier Tribunal decided that  the  Secretary
       of State had failed to do that.

   63. The First-tier Tribunal Judge  analysed  the  Secretary  of  State's
       case.  The Secretary of State  relied  on  an  August  2017  Country
       Policy and Information Note  that  the  PKK  situation  has  changed
       saying that those associated with the PKK who were in  trouble  with
       the state probably risked prosecution for being linked to an illegal
       organisation rather than persecution.  There is also a similar  CPIN
       for March 2016 showing that the claimant was too  old  for  military
       service and the Secretary of State decided that the claimant was not
       likely to be pursued for military service.

   64. The Secretary of State decided that  there  had  been  a  change  in
       circumstances so that the claimant would not be at risk.

   65. The First-tier Tribunal Judge noted that the  UNHCR  disagreed  with
       the decision.

   66. The UNHCR knew that since the coup  attempt  of  15  July  2016  the
       Turkish authorities had "pursued an unprecedented crackdown  against
       perceived critics and opponents" and did not accept that fundamental
       changes in the sense of Article 1C(5) had not  occurred  in  Turkey.
       However the Secretary of State did not accept that the claimant  had
       a sufficiently high profile to  be  of  interest  in  the  event  of
       return.

   67. The judge then considered Ms Laizer's  report  and  her  conclusions
       that the attitude in Turkey towards Kurds and anyone linked with the
       PKK was worse now than in 2006 and there were "very  high  risks  of
       unfair detention and ill-treatment" she  confirmed  that  the  legal
       records had not been expunged through  the  passage  of  time.   The
       First-tier Tribunal Judge accepted Ms Laizer's evidence.

   68.  An  important  reason  for  the  Secretary  of  State  being  given
       permission to appeal was that it was arguable  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had not  explained  why  the  evidence  of  Ms  Laizer  was
       preferred to the evidence relied upon by the Secretary of State.

   69. In truth little evidence was relied upon by the Secretary of  State.
       The CPIN reports are based on summaries or extracts from a range  of
       human rights reports and, although a useful starting  point,  rarely
       provide much depth. According to Ms Laizer's report at paragraph 3.2
       the CPIN dated August 2017 "has been overtaken by the their own most
       recent guidance".

   70. It may well be that the focus of ill treatment is presently directed
       towards recent  Kurdish  activists  but  the  "clampdown"  on  those
       opposed to the government is very significant.  Ms  Laizer's  report
       cites evidence in a 2019 report that in the  "last  two  years  more
       than 100,000 people have been detained".

   71. It is wrong to focus on prison conditions in the sense of cell  size
       and nutrition. The concern is the widespread abuse of prisoners.  Ms
       Laizer refers to reports that Turkish prisons are "full  of  torture
       and abuse", that "reports of abuse in detention, including  beatings
       and rape, are extremely alarming in Turkish  jails"  and  that  "the
       torture, abuse and ill-treatment of detainee and prisoners in Turkey
       has become the norm rather than the exception. These quotations  are
       not  from  popular  newspapers  but  from,  for   example,   Amnesty
       International and the Stockholm Center for Freedom.

   72. In short, there was ample evidence before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       which supported the judge's ultimate conclusion that there  had  not
       been a significant and non-temporary change in conditions in  Turkey
       such that the claimant was no longer at risk on return.

   73. Importantly, there was absolutely no reason for the  judge  to  find
       that the sophisticated widespread record keeping in which people are
       linked to family members and  possibly  other  associates  who  have
       attracted the adverse attention of the authorities has  in  any  way
       diminished its reach since the Tribunal decided IK (Turkey).  Indeed
       it was Ms Laizer's evidence that arrival of  electronic  information
       systems means that records are more accessible and possibly  further
       reaching than before.

   74. It must follow from this that the judge was entitled  to  find  that
       there is a real risk that the claimant's past associations will come
       to the attention of the authorities and that he would be at risk  as
       a result of those associations

   75. They are indeed "past" associations.  This is not a man who has been
       active in Kurdish separatism.  There is  no  evidence  that  he  has
       added to the cause during his time in the United Kingdom.   However,
       it is also plain that he has been  associated  with  some  prominent
       activists and this link will show up when he is investigated.

   76. His case has fallen for consideration at a  time  when  the  Turkish
       authorities have been clamping down on any kind of opposition and we
       do not accept that the distinction drawn by the Secretary  of  State
       between  "persecution"  and  "prosecution"  is  all  that   helpful.
       Persecutory behaviour does not cease to be persecution by reason  of
       it being identified as a particular criminal offence.

   77. On the evidence before us, if the claimant is in trouble it  is  not
       because of anything he has done to undermine the  Turkish  state  in
       the last twenty years  but  because  of  his  ethnicity  and  family
       members and previous  activities.   It  is  trite  asylum  law  that
       persecuting states cannot be assumed to  behave  rationally.   Their
       agenda is to crush a particular cause.  We repeat we  are  satisfied
       that the First-tier Tribunal Judge was entitled to  reach  the  view
       that he did.

   78. In the reasons for refusal the Secretary  of  State,  appropriately,
       refers back to the letter of 24 October 2017 giving Notification  of
       Intention to Revoke Refugee Status.

   79. It is absolutely right that the Secretary of State has  acknowledged
       evidence of prosecution and harassment of  PKK  supporters.   It  is
       also right that the CPIN of August 2017 referred  to  supporters  or
       perceived supporters (or their relatives) of the PKK being likely to
       face questioning and some harassment or discrimination.   That  does
       not deal with the situation of this claimant who would  be  returned
       to Turkey after a long break and could expect to be discovered as  a
       PKK sympathiser who had avoided  military  service  by  leaving  the
       country.  It is quite clear from the  evidence  of  Ms  Laizer  that
       there is, at the very least, good reason to suspect that people seen
       as opponents to the government are being  targeted  for  unjustified
       prosecution and ill-treatment.

   80. The claimant would have to re-establish  himself  in  Turkey.   This
       will involve entering the country and then  registering  himself  in
       wherever community he chooses  to  settle.   This  will  necessarily
       bring him into contact with the authorities when his past  behaviour
       will be revealed.

   81. Asylum decisions, particularly those that go to appeal,  are  rarely
       about certainties.  A real risk is sufficient to entitle a person to
       protection and although there have certainly been  many  changes  in
       Turkey during the claimant's absence, and  for  a  time  there  were
       reasons to  think  there  had  been  significant  improvements,   we
       consider that the judge was entitled as a matter of law to find that
       the changes had not been significant and non-temporary and that they
       would not have removed the risk to the claimant

   82. As required by the grant of permission we  have  gone  back  to  the
       materials relied on by the Secretary of State and applied our  minds
       carefully  to  the  risks  facing  this  particular  claimant.    We
       acknowledge Mr Clarke's submissions that the claimant's case is that
       he associated himself with a  separatist  group  from  the  PKK  and
       disavowed violent revolution.  With respect to  Mr  Clarke  this  is
       rather missing the point.  The issue is not if  the  claimant  is  a
       threat to the state of Turkey (and there is evidence that  political
       opposition of the most respectable kind is perceived  in  this  way)
       but whether he would be perceived  by  the  state  of  Turkey  as  a
       threat.  We have no basis for thinking a Turkish police  officer  or
       Immigration  Officer  would  be  particularly  concerned  with   the
       distinction.   We  found  paragraph  5(v)  of  Ms  Laizer's   report
       particularly pithy.  She said there:


  "Whilst some aspects of CG IK remain valid when  profiling  a  Kurd  like
  [the claimant] on return to Turkey, reference to the GBTS database  alone
  - in terms of what is held on Turkish security databases - has long  been
  out  of  date.   "The  information  on  individuals  is   obtained   from
  'investigative  work,  interrogation,  citizens'  letters,  emails,   new
  stories, video clips from surveillance cameras, city surveillance cameras
  (MOBESE subject to police interference and  deletions)  photos,  identity
  information etc. making and  profiling  of  criminals.'   [The  claimant]
  would however, still show as a draft evader: it is not his age,  but  his
  evasion of military service that counts,  contrary  to  the  Home  Office
  Decision letter.  Turks are expected to comply with military service  and
  to consider it an honour to serve the  Turkish  motherland.   When  Kurds
  avoid military service, the imputation is that they are not loyal to  the
  Turkish state and are therefore opponents likely to support the PKK."

   83. Ms Laizer then said in sub-paragraph (viii) that in her  opinion  it
       was "extremely likely that the Turkish authorities  will  check  any
       past information held on  [the  claimant]  and  that  of  any  known
       associates  and  family  members   and   they   will   profile   him
       accordingly".

   84. The claimant has the additional disadvantage of coming from Agri and
       that is an area where PKK activity has continued.

   85. The weak spot in the claimant's case insofar as it relates  to  Miss
       Laizer's report is the likelihood of his experiencing any of the bad
       things that  are  known  to  happen.   The  Secretary  of  State  is
       perfectly entitled to take the view that Kurds,  generally,  do  not
       risk persecutory ill-treatment  but  this  claimant  is  not  to  be
       regarded as an ordinary Kurd but one who has had a long absence from
       the country with an adverse profile  and  a  particular  reason  for
       police interest because he has not done his military service.  These
       points are not properly supported or investigated in  the  Secretary
       of State's reasons.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge was  entitled  to
       prefer the specific and up-to-date evidence.

   86. In short, however unattractive that the answer might  be  given  the
       serious offending with which this claimant has been  associated  (we
       do not lose sight of the fact that he has a conviction for  firearms
       offences considerably before  the  matter  leading  to  the  present
       decision) the First-tier Tribunal's conclusion that the Secretary of
       State had  failed  to  show  that  the  claimant  no  longer  needed
       international protection was plainly  open  to  it.   It  is  to  be
       recalled that the judge's conclusion in this  regard  accorded  with
       the opinion of the UNHCR, to which particular respect  was  due:  IA
       (Iran) [2014] UKSC 6; [2014] 1 WLR 384, at [44].

   87. We turn now to the judge's separate analysis of whether the claimant
       should lose the protection against refoulement as a  result  of  his
       offending, under Article 33(2) of the Convention and s72 of the 2002
       Act.  Our focus is on the judge's conclusion that the claimant is no
       longer a danger to the community.  As far as we  are  aware  it  has
       never been suggested, nor could it be, that  he  has  not  committed
       very serious crimes.

   88. We find the judge's reasons for concluding  that  the  claimant  had
       successfully rebutted the statutory presumption that he represents a
       danger to the community to be problematic.  They are  summarised  at
       paragraph 40 where the judge said:


  "Having weighed all of these factors very  carefully,  I  find  that  the
  difficulty I am left with is weighing such serious  criminality  and  the
  possibility of  the  [claimant]  returning  to  it  because  it  was  his
  lifestyle at the time, against the [claimant's] good behaviour,  progress
  and attitude since he was sent to prison.  Ultimately, the factors I find
  that tip the balance in the [claimant's] favour are: the changes  he  has
  made and the rehabilitation he has shown have endured for the  ten   year
  length of his sentence; that he will not be left to his  own  devices  to
  face any challenges on release from custody; and the  motivation  he  has
  shown because of his children who he will lose if he reoffends, not  only
  because of what they have said but also because  he  may  then  face  the
  possibility of removal from the country again."

   89. The children did not give evidence.   The  judge  observed  that  it
       would have "been helpful to have heard from them"  but  he  accepted
       the explanation that they had not attended the  hearing  because  it
       was about his asylum claim and not his relationship with  them.   It
       is not our business to know what passed between  the  claimant,  his
       children and the legal advisers but we find it a  rather  surprising
       suggestion to make about a case where his future conduct as well  as
       his need for protection has had to be considered.

   90. The reasons set out in paragraph 40 necessarily refer  back  to  the
       preceding paragraph where the judge noted that the claimant would be
       under the supervision of an offender manager and he was the  subject
       of a Serious Crime Prevention Order.  Clearly the judge  found  both
       of those features significant in  reaching  his  conclusion  and  we
       find, notwithstanding our initial interest in the Order, that he was
       wrong to do that.  The Serious Crime Prevention Order  made  against
       the claimant is very detailed and precisely drawn but in broad terms
       prohibits him  from  having  more  than  �1,000  in  cash  and  from
       transferring more than �1,000 per week within the United Kingdom and
       from possessing more than one "mobile communication device" and from
       notifying the authorities of  any  vehicle  he  controls  and  other
       matters about his identity and address.

   91. We have also considered R v Hancox [2010] EWCA Crim  102;  [2010]  1
       WLR 1434 which looks at the purpose of a  Serious  Crime  Prevention
       Order.  It is clear that such orders are not made routinely and when
       they are made they are made because the judge imposing the  sentence
       is satisfied that there is a future real risk of a person committing
       serious offences: [9] of Hancox refers.  Of course,  the  fact  that
       that was the view of the circuit judge  when  sentence  was  imposed
       does not mean that it is the state of affairs when the claimant came
       to be released but the judge in the First-tier Tribunal was wrong to
       regard the existence  of  that  order  purely  as  a  check  on  the
       claimant's  behaviour  when  in  fact  it  was  indicative  of   the
       sentencing judge being persuaded that  there  was  a  real  risk  of
       further offending. Further the terms of the order frustrate mischief
       rather than promote good behaviour. It is hard to see that the order
       adds anything to the support of the probation officer.

   92. We fully appreciate that the judge also had in mind the  supervisory
       role of the probation officer but we  cannot  avoid  coming  to  the
       conclusion that  he  took  a  bad  point  by  incorporating  in  his
       reasoning something that should not be there. The judge's  reference
       to "factors that tip the balance" indicate  that  he  found  this  a
       close call and his reliance on a bad point, we find, undermines  the
       decision as a whole.

   93. We set aside the decision that the claimant  does  not  represent  a
       danger to the community of the United Kingdom.

   94. In reaching that conclusion, we do not suggest  that  there  was  no
       evidence  before  the  judge  which  militated  in  favour  of   the
       conclusion reached, but simply that his evaluation  was  tainted  by
       the one dimensional view he took of the SCPO.

   95. We have in mind the clear evidence of the claimant's good  behaviour
       in prison and his protestations about his future behaviour. We  have
       noted the claimant's  comment,  recorded  in  the  OASys  Assessment
       (page 106 in the bundle), "I have learnt my lesson, I have completed
       16 and a half years in prison all together and don't want to  do  it
       anymore".  However this is only helpful if he is able to give effect
       to his intentions. We have no idea how, or even "if" he can  support
       himself in the community. We would like to know what has happened to
       his confiscation order (see OASys Assessment at page 95 of bundle).

   96. The case will be relisted in the Upper Tribunal before this division
       of the Tribunal if reasonably practicable.

   97. We make it plain that the judge's findings regarding  the  cessation
       of refugee status contained no legal error and are preserved.  It is
       the assessment  of  the  risk  presented  by  the  claimant  to  the
       community of the United Kingdom which falls to be  assessed  afresh,
       as part of the assessment of whether he is a refoulable refugee.

   98. It is for the parties to decide on the evidence on which  they  seek
       to rely but we are particularly concerned about the  order  made  in
       the Westminster Magistrates' Court and  the  outstanding  sums  that
       exist in the way of a compensation order.  There is  nothing  before
       us to suggest that the claimant has any  ability  to  discharge  his
       financial obligations and the existence of that order may (we put it
       no higher than that) be an incentive for him not to comply with good
       behaviour but rather to encourage him to  resume  his  old  criminal
       ways. The parties may find it helpful to address us about this.

   99. It follows therefore that the Secretary of State's  appeal  succeeds
       in part.  We dismiss the challenge to the finding that the  claimant
       still needs protection but we allow the  challenge  to  the  finding
       that he is still  entitled  to  the  protection  of  the  Convention
       against refoulement.


Notice of Decision

  100. The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed to the extent that we set
       aside the finding that the claimant is not a risk to  the  community
       and we direct the case be heard again on that  point  in  the  Upper
       Tribunal.  We dismiss the appeal against the finding that he  is  at
       risk of serious ill-treatment in Turkey.
