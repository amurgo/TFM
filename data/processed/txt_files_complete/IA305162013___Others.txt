Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr R Singer, Counsel, instructed by Lee Valley
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   These appeals first appeared before me at an error of law hearing on  1
    September 2014.  On that occasion the appellants were represented by Mr
    A Jafar, Counsel, and the  respondent  by  Mr  T  Melvin,  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer.  At that hearing I decided that there  had  been  a
    material error of law in the judge's decision dismissing  the  appeals,
    and that the decisions needed to be remade.  My error of  law  decision
    was as follows (with correction of an error in [i]).

          i. The appellants are a family,  all  of  whom  are  citizens  of
             Pakistan.  The first and second appellants are a  couple,  and
             the third and fourth appellants are their children.  The first
             and fifth appellants, having been in the UK as Tier  1  (Post-
             Study Work) Migrants, applied for further leave to  remain  as
             Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrants.  The children were  listed  as
             their dependants.  The applications were refused  on  10  July
             2013.  The appeals were then dismissed by First-tier  Tribunal
             Judge Prior, in a determination promulgated on 25 April 2014.


         ii. Permission to appeal was refused by Designated Judge Baird  on
             14 May 2014, but was then granted by Upper Tribunal Judge King
             on 4 July 2014.


        iii. The grounds seeking permission to appeal argued that the judge
             had erred in law in requiring submission of a bank letter, and
             in requiring a joint account, with reference to paragraph  41-
             SD of Appendix A to the Immigration Rules.  The second  ground
             was that the judge had erred in relation to paragraph 245AA of
             the Immigration Rules, and the evidential flexibility  policy.
             Reference  was  also  made  to  the  recent  case   of   Shebl
             (Entrepreneur: proof of contracts) [2014] UKUT 216 (IAC).   In
             granting permission Upper Tribunal Judge King  noted  that  it
             was not clear from the findings what the  judge  had  held  in
             relation to the issue of joint accounts.  He also  noted  that
             both  of  the  appellants  were   directors   and   had   made
             declarations in favour of each other as  to  the  use  of  the
             money in their accounts.


         iv. As I indicated at the hearing I decided, having considered the
             submissions made by both sides, that the judge  had  erred  in
             law in a manner material to the outcome, and that there was  a
             need to remake the decision.


          v. The Immigration Rules in this area are complex  and  difficult
             to understand.  I  have  considerable  sympathy  with  anybody
             faced with the task of attempting to understand  them.   Given
             the nature of the Rules it appears to me  that  the  room  for
             misunderstanding is considerable at every  level:  applicants,
             their advisors, the decision makers within  the  Home  Office,
             representatives for both sides at hearings and  judges.   This
             was illustrated by the difficulties in achieving clarity as to
             the actual requirements of the  Rules  at  a  lengthy  hearing
             during which both representatives clearly did  their  best  to
             offer assistance in this regard.


         vi. The judge, in his determination, summarised  the  respondent's
             case at paragraph 11, and provided the  reasons  for  his  own
             decision at paragraph 14.  Central to the judge's decision was
             the following statement.


        vii. "What was required was a bank letter stating  that  the  first
             and fifth appellants had contractual entitlement to the credit
             balance appearing in the bank statement produced for  a  joint
             account."


       viii. The bank letter referred to in this sentence  refers  back  to
             the summary of both letters  of  refusal,  which  referred  to
             paragraph 41-SD(A)(i).  This was quoted in part by  the  judge
             at the start of paragraph 11.


         ix. What was accepted at the hearing before me, however, was  that
             the requirement for a bank letter,  at  paragraph  41-SD(A)(i)
             was only applicable where funds  were  not  held  in  the  UK.
             Within paragraph 41-SD there is an alternative for money  held
             in the UK only.  This is set out  at  paragraph  41-SD(A)(ii).
             It was accepted at the hearing  before  me  that  the  sum  of
             �10,000 referred to in the first  appellant's  refusal  letter
             was money held in the UK.  It was therefore  agreed  that  the
             bank letter referred to in paragraphs 11 and 14 of the judge's
             determination was not  a  requirement  under  the  Immigration
             Rules.  The  same  point  applied  in  the  fifth  appellant's
             refusal letter.  The sum of �25,000 referred to in that letter
             was also money held in the UK.


          x. It is not clear whether the appellant's representatives at the
             hearing made a submission to the judge to the effect that  the
             bank letter requirement was not applicable.  In any event this
             is a matter  that  involved  the  judge's  interpretation  and
             application of the Immigration Rules, and within  the  sea  of
             complexity and uncertainty it did at least appear to be  clear
             that the bank letter requirement on which the refusal  letters
             were primarily based, and that formed the basis of the judge's
             decision, was not one that was in fact applicable, given  that
             the funds in question were held in the UK.  For that reason  I
             have decided that the determination contained an  error  on  a
             point of law in relation to paragraph 41-SD.


         xi. The judge dealt with the evidential flexibility submissions in
             brief terms.  The reasoning referred to "non-compliance on the
             part of the appellants with the mandatory requirements of  the
             Rules".  As will be clear from the above the bank letter issue
             was not an applicable mandatory requirement.   On  that  basis
             the consideration of the  evidential  flexibility  submissions
             must also be said to have proceeded on an erroneous basis.


        xii. For these reasons I find that the grounds are made out.  There
             was a material error of law on a point of law.   The  findings
             in relation to the Immigration  Rules,  and  relevant  policy,
             fall to be set aside, and the decisions need to be remade.


       xiii. Both representatives were content  that  the  remaking  should
             take place in the Upper Tribunal.  Neither suggested that  the
             appeal  should  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier.    I   have
             considered the Practice Direction.  Taking the  views  of  the
             parties into  account,  and  considering  the  terms  of  that
             direction, I decided that there was no justification to depart
             from the normal expected practice of a remaking  taking  place
             in the Upper Tribunal.


        xiv. After some discussion about whether it was possible to proceed
             immediately to remaking the decisions I decided to adjourn for
             a remaking hearing.  Neither side had with them  the  relevant
             Rules and policy on evidential flexibility.  This is a complex
             area.  Paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules was changed by
             HC 628  in  September  2013.   There  was  a  version  of  the
             modernised guidance document in force between March  2013  and
             May 2013.  What is needed, for the remaking to proceed on  the
             correct basis, is an agreement as to  the  correct  applicable
             version of paragraph 245AA, and  the  applicable  version,  if
             any, of the policy document.  The  potential  significance  is
             that the policy document which was the second Appendix to  the
             Rodriguez  decision  in  the   Upper   Tribunal   included   a
             requirement for  caseworkers  to  make  further  enquiries  if
             information  was  missing  from  a  document  in  a   Tier   1
             (Entrepreneur) application.


         xv. The other point that was given consideration was about whether
             the decisions were not in accordance with the law  because  of
             the approach  in  the  refusal  letters  to  the  bank  letter
             requirement  in  41-SD(A)(i).   The  decisions  also  fail  to
             mention paragraph 52 of  Appendix  A,  which  deals  with  the
             requirements where entrepreneurial teams are  claiming  points
             for the same investment and business activity.   Paragraph  52
             refers to Tables 4-5 and 6.  Neither side had provided a  copy
             of these tables.  In essence it appeared that Table 4 was  the
             only one relevant, and  that  it  referred  back  in  turn  to
             paragraph 41-SD.  What remained unclear was whether the  terms
             of  41-SD(A)(ii)   amounted   to   a   requirement   that   an
             entrepreneurial team could only succeed if the funds that they
             were relying on were  in  a  joint  account,  rather  than  in
             separate accounts.





2.   At the start of the hearing it was drawn to  my  attention  that  there
    was an error in the  first  paragraph  of  my  error  of  law  decision
    (corrected in the version above), about the nature of the relationships
    between the appellants.  The correct position is  that  the  first  and
    fifth  appellants  are  business  partners,  who  put   forward   joint
    applications  as  Tier  1  (Entrepreneurs).   The  first   and   second
    appellants are  a  couple,  and  the  remaining  appellants  are  their
    children.

3.   For the remaking hearing Mr Singer,  for  the  appellants,  provided  a
    useful  written  submission  document.   This  set  out  the   relevant
    Immigration Rules as they were at the date of application (28  February
    2013).  The Rules set out were paragraph 245DD; Table 4 (referred to in
    paragraph 14 above);  paragraph  41;  paragraph  41-SD;  and  paragraph
    245AA.  In addition Mr Singer produced Appendix A  to  the  Immigration
    Rules, and three versions of the Home Office guidance on PBS evidential
    flexibility.  Version 1.0 was valid from  12  March  2013  (just  after
    these applications were  made,  but  well  before  the  decisions  were
    taken); version 2.0 was valid from 20 May 2013;  and  version  3.0  was
    valid from 12 September 2013.  These decisions were refused on 10  July
    2013, and the version in force at this date was therefore version  2.0.



4.   I am grateful to Mr Singer for providing a comprehensive range  of  the
    relevant Rules and guidance, in compliance  with  the  directions  made
    after the error of law hearing.

5.   In his written submissions Mr Singer made  three  points,  namely  that
    the decisions were not in accordance with the Immigration  Rules;  that
    they were not in accordance with the law; and that they  were  contrary
    to Article 8.  He made the point that the decision  maker  should  have
    acknowledged  that   the   first   and   fifth   appellants   were   an
    entrepreneurial team, submitting their applications at the same time.

6.   Mr Singer's initial submissions at  the  hearing  were  concerned  with
    evidential flexibility.  He pointed to the discretion  to  contact  the
    appellants or representatives for clarification or to  request  missing
    documents or information, in version 2.0 of the guidance.  The  missing
    letters, in which each of the entrepreneurial  partners  was  asked  to
    confirm the availability of funds to the other, were exactly  the  sort
    of thing that could have been provided if asked for.  The idea  in  the
    refusal letters that the letters would not have made  a  difference  to
    the outcome if they had been asked for was nonsense.

7.   Following an examination of version 2.0 of the guidance Mr Walker,  for
    the respondent, indicated that he agreed that there had been a relevant
    discretion under the guidance that appeared not to have been considered
    by the  decision  maker.   On  that  basis  he  agreed  that  it  would
    appropriate for the appeals, in being remade,  to  be  allowed  to  the
    limited extent that the decisions were not in accordance with the  law.
    As a consequence of this agreement it became  unnecessary  to  consider
    the matters raised in relation to the Immigration Rules, or Article  8.



8.   As I indicated at paragraph 5 of my error of law decision the Rules  in
    this area are highly complex.  The agreed position at the hearing  will
    have the effect of bringing  these  appeals  to  an  end,  but  further
    decisions will need to be taken on the applications that were made back
    in February 2013.  For the purpose of that consideration  the  decision
    maker is not restricted to evidence that was submitted  at  that  time.
    The restriction on considering post application evidence  only  applies
    to the appeal process, and not to Home Office decision makers.

9.   I emphasised to the appellants that it would  be  of  great  importance
    for  them  and  their  representatives  to  go  through  all   of   the
    requirements in the Rules and ensure that every evidential  requirement
    was fully complied with.  Any reconsideration  should  also  take  into
    account the points that were agreed at the error  of  law  hearing,  in
    relation to some aspects of the initial decisions.  The decision maker,
    who has the unenviable task of applying these Rules,  should  also  pay
    careful attention to the current Rules on evidential flexibility.   The
    question of  how  things  have  moved  on  in  relation  to  evidential
    flexibility was not discussed, because I was concerned with  the  dates
    of application and decision in these appeals.  That is  another  matter
    where careful attention will need to be paid to the current  applicable
    Rules by the decision maker, although if the appellants are careful  to
    provide every item required in the specified evidence section it is  to
    be hoped that there will be no missing items when the matter  comes  to
    be considered again.

10.  I am grateful to both representatives for their assistance,  and  to  a
    sensible and properly reached agreement that has enabled these  appeals
    to be disposed of in an appropriate and just manner.

11.  It was not suggested that there was any need  for  anonymity  in  these
    appeals.  Since, in being remade, the appeals have  been  allowed,  the
    question of fee awards arises.  Neither side made  any  submissions  on
    this issue.  On the basis that the decisions  were  not  in  accordance
    with the law for failure  to  consider  one  of  the  respondent's  own
    relevant published policies I have decided that it  is  appropriate  to
    make whole fee awards in each appeal.

Notice of Decision

12.  The appeals of all five appellants, falling to be remade since  earlier
    decisions have been set aside, are allowed to the limited  extent  that
    the decisions were not  in  accordance  with  the  law,  and  that  the
    applications remain outstanding awaiting lawful decisions.
