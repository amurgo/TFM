Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Mills, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    None; the Sponsor, Mr Saquib Mahmood, present


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Respondent, a national  of  Pakistan,  date  of  birth  [  ]  1993,
    appealed against the decision of the Appellant, hereafter  referred  to
    as the ECO, whose decision was made on 27 August 2014 to  refuse  entry
    clearance as a partner under Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules  HC
    395 (as amended) (the Rules), with reference particularly to  paragraph
    EC-P.1.1. and Appendix  FM-SE,  because  the  Respondent's  application
    sponsored by Mr Mahmood, her husband, had failed to provide evidence of
    his earnings covering either the period of six months at  the  date  of
    application or, if not, over a  more  extended  period  which  was  not
    directly applicable.

2.     The matter  came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Andonian  (the
    Judge), who, on 14 May 2015, allowed the appeal under  the  Immigration
    Rules and made a  fee  award  in  the  sum  of  �70.   The  ECO  sought
    permission to appeal the Judge's decision on 15 June  2015  and  on  21
    August 2015 was granted permission to  appeal  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Colyer.

3.   For no apparent reason, except presumably case  load,  the  appeal  has
    since then taken a significant length of time to come forward, which is
    a matter of real regret because it was quite apparent, particularly  if
    the Sponsor had obtained legal advice, the  appeal  was  sure  to  fail
    because the relevant specified evidence covering the period required in
    advance of the date of application had not been provided.  It is  clear
    from Appendix FM-SE what those requirements  were.   Quite  simply  the
    Judge's exercise in seeking to avoid the requirements of the  specified
    evidence was an error of law.  The issue of whether the  Sponsor  could
    show the required income level over a year of �18,600 was not correctly
    addressed and reasoned by the Judge.

.    In the circumstances I was satisfied that the original Tribunal made  a
    material error of law and that decision could not stand.

4.   I explained at length to the Sponsor why the  ECO's  appeal  succeeded,
    the need for the Sponsor and his wife to make a  new  application  with
    the correct documentary evidence as well as the  benefit  of  obtaining
    legal assistance to deal  with  the  complexities  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

5.     In the circumstances of the case therefore, there being  no  evidence
    to meet the requirements of Appendix FM-SE at the date of  application,
    I was satisfied that the only outcome to the appeal was that the  ECO's
    appeal must be allowed. It is appropriate for the anonymity order to be
    continued.

DECISION
      The Original Tribunal's decision can not stand.
       The following decision substituted. The appeal of  [BR]  against  the
    ECO's decision dated 27 August 2014 is dismissed.

DIRECTION REGARDING ANONYMITY - RULE 14 OF  THE  TRIBUNAL  PROCEDURE  (UPPER
TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

Signed                                  Date 24 April 2016

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davey



TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

In the circumstances the fee award cannot  stand,  the  appeal  against  the
ECO's decision having failed.
