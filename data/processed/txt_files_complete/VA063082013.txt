                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The  Appellant,  a  national  of  Pakistan,   appealed   against   the
    Respondent's decision dated 20 February 2013 to refuse entry  clearance
    as a family visitor  with  reference  to  paragraph  41  and  paragraph
    320(7A) of the Immigration Rules HC 395 as amended.  The appeal against
    that decision came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Shanahan  (the
    judge) who dismissed the appeal.  Permission to  appeal  that  decision
    was given by First-tier Tribunal P J G White on 28 March 2014.

2.   With reference  to  paragraph  41  of  the  Rules  the  judge  was  not
    satisfied the Appellant's intentions were as claimed for  the  purposes
    of a short family visit and no appeal  was  made  against  the  judge's
    decision in respect of the Appellant's failing to meet the requirements
    of paragraph 41 of the Rules.

3.   At the heart of the original refusal was the fact that the  Appellant's
    passport showed an entry stamp into the United Kingdom on 15 March 2012
    and an arrival stamp in Pakistan dated 15 April 2012 yet other evidence
    showed that the Appellant did not leave the  United  Kingdom  until  11
    September 2012.  Secondly the Appellant had failed to disclose that  on
    2 May 2012 he had been refused leave to enter the  Irish  Republic  and
    that refusal had not been declared.  There was produced  to  the  judge
    the document, which were reservation details which  purported  to  show
    the  Appellant  travelling  to  the  United   Kingdom   to   Birmingham
    International on 15 March 2012 and returning to Pakistan and  Islamabad
    International Airport on 14/15 April 2012.

4.   However also provided to the judge was the coupon  record  in  relation
    to the same tickets which showed that the Appellant had a  ticket  from
    Islamabad to Birmingham of 15 March 2012  with  an  intended  departure
    date of 14 April 2012 for a total price  of  52,261  PKR.   The  second
    coupon provided shows that the flight for 14 April 2012 was  exchanged.
    The exchange is demonstrated by the  switch  of  dates  showing  a  new
    departure date from Birmingham International to Islamabad International
    on 11 September 2012.  An additional fee of ï¿½40 sterling  was  paid  in
    cash and a new ticket was issued at Birmingham International.

5.   The judge read and understood the particular document, provided by  the
    Appellant and concluded that it was consistent  with  the  Respondent's
    case that the Appellant had not left as claimed.  Therefore  the  entry
    stamp of 15 April 2012 was necessarily  false  and  the  Appellant  had
    spent significantly  longer,  in  unexplained  personal  and  financial
    circumstances in the United Kingdom  for  over  five  months  from  his
    claimed departure date.  Thus the appeal was going to fail on the basis
    of a false stamp come what may.  As to the  issue  of  the  Appellant's
    refusal of entry clearance to the Irish Republic  documents  supporting
    that  matter  were  not  produced  but  the  Respondent   provided   an
    explanation which was met by grounds of appeal which argued that he had
    not used deception or intended to deceive.  It was said  with  reliance
    upon the case of Farqan  Ahmed  that  he  had  not  been  dishonest  or
    deceptive in failing to refer to such refusal in his visa application.

6.   Ultimately the judge was  not  impressed  with  the  explanation  being
    proffered on behalf of the Appellant for there was  no  explanation  in
    relation to the entry stamp or the omission of the refusal by the Irish
    Republic.

7.   Accordingly the judge found absent  proper  explanation  in  any  event
    that the appeal failed in both respects.   The  position  remains  that
    even if the judge was wrong about the issue  of  the  Appellant's  non-
    disclosure of the Irish authorities refusal in May 2012 the fact is  on
    the Appellant's own documentation he  could  not  show  anything  which
    could suggest that the stamp dated 15 April  2012  was  anything  other
    than even if genuine in origins falsely obtained and inserted into  the
    passport.  In these circumstances therefore the appeal  was  doomed  to
    fail come what may on the Appellant's own evidence.

8.   Contrary to the submission made there is no purpose served  in  sending
    this matter back for some further explanation about the  issue  of  the
    non-disclosure of the Irish refusal of entry.   It  serves  no  purpose
    because the appeal was doomed to fail on the issue of his  presence  in
    the United Kingdom at a time when he said he was absent.  The  original
    Tribunal made no  error  of  law.   The  original  Tribunal's  decision
    stands.   The  appeal  against  the  original  Tribunal's  decision  is
    dismissed.
