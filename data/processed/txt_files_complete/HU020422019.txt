                           ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen  of  Somalia  born  on  2  August  1968.  He
    appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge J C Hamilton,
    promulgated on 13 November 2019,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    refusal of entry clearance on human rights grounds.

2.   Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede  on  20
    August 2020 on the ground it was arguable  the  judge  failed  to  make
    findings on the evidence of two witnesses who  gave  oral  evidence  in
    support of the Appellant's case and failed to make findings of fact  on
    parts of the evidence which were arguably material.

3.   In her Rule 24 response, the Respondent did not oppose the  Appellant's
    application and invited the Tribunal to determine  the  appeal  with  a
    fresh oral (continuance) hearing.

4.   I find that the judge erred in law and I set aside the  decision  dated
    13 November 2019  under  Rule  43  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008. None of the judge's findings are  preserved.  The
    appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for re-hearing.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award
because the Appellant's appeal remains outstanding.
