For the Appellant:     Mrs S Katun of Taj Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Howells, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was born  on  10  February
    1976.  On 26 February 2017, he made an application for entry  clearance
    to join his spouse (Mrs [MB]), who is a British citizen, in the UK.

 2. On 8 November 2017, the Entry Clearance  Officer  ("ECO")  refused  the
    application under the relevant 'partner' provisions in Appendix FM (EC-
    P) and Art 8 outside the Rules.

 3. The basis of  the  ECO's  decision  was  that  he  concluded  that  the
    appellant had been dishonest in putting forward false information about
    the sponsor's income in the UK and that the submitted documentation did
    not establish that the appellant (by the claimed income of the sponsor)
    satisfied the 'financial requirements' in Appendix FM of  demonstrating
    an income of at least ï¿½18,600.  Finally, not being satisfied  that  the
    appellant met the requirements of the Rules, the ECO concluded that the
    decision not to grant entry clearance was a proportionate  interference
    with the appellant's Art 8 rights.

 4. The appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Judge  Suffield-
    Thompson dismissed the appeal.

 5. Having heard the sponsor give evidence, the  judge  was  not  satisfied
    that the respondent had established that the  appellant  (and  sponsor)
    were dishonest in asserting the sponsor's claimed  employments  in  the
    UK.  However, the judge  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  had
    submitted the required 'specified documents' under  Appendix  FM-SE  in
    order to establish the sponsor's claimed income with her two  employers
    for the required 6 months prior to the application.  In particular,  at
    para [33] the judge concluded that, in a  run  of  monthly  wage  slips
    between August 2016 and February 2017,  the  wage  slips  for  October,
    November and December 2016 were missing from the bundles  and  had  not
    been  submitted  with  the  application.   There  were   also   missing
    corresponding bank statements also required by Appendix FM-SE.   Having
    concluded that the appellant  could  not  establish  that  he  met  the
    requirements of the Rules, the Judge concluded  that  the  decision  to
    refuse entry clearance was not a breach of Art 8.

 6. The appellant was granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal by
    the F-tT (Judge N Haria) on 30 August 2019, inter alia, on  the  ground
    that the judge had been wrong to find that there were missing documents
    from the application and that, in fact, the appellant met the financial
    requirements of Appendix FM on the  basis  of  the  required  specified
    documents under Appendix FM-SE submitted with his application for entry
    clearance.

 7. At the hearing before me, Mr Howells who represented the  ECO  accepted
    that the required wage slips and corresponding bank statements covering
    the 6-month period prior to the application were indeed in the file and
    had been submitted with the application.  He accepted  that  the  judge
    had been wrong to conclude  that  they  were  not  submitted  with  the
    application.  Mr Howells accepted that the appellant, on the  basis  of
    this evidence, had in  fact  established  that  he  met  the  financial
    requirements of the Rules  on  the  basis  of  the  required  specified
    evidence.  Mr Howells accepted that, there being no issue in respect of
    any other requirement of  the  'partner'  rules  in  Appendix  FM,  the
    appellant had established that he was entitled to entry clearance as  a
    'partner' under those Rules.  Mr Howells invited me to  set  aside  the
    judge's  decision  and  re-make  the  decision.   Accepting  that   the
    appellant met the requirements of the Rules, Mr Howells saw  no  reason
    why the appeal should not be allowed under Art 8.

 8. I am satisfied that the judge did err in law in  reaching  her  adverse
    finding under the Rules.  The specified  documents  were  both  in  the
    Tribunal's bundles and,  as  was  accepted  by  Mr  Howells,  had  been
    submitted with the application.  These documents comply  with  Appendix
    FM-SE and establish that the appellant met the  financial  requirements
    in E-ECP.3.1 and 3.2 based upon  the  sponsor's  income  from  her  two
    genuine (as accepted after the judge's decision) employments in the  UK
    over the relevant 6-month period prior to the application.  There being
    no other issue taken under the  Rules,  as  Mr  Howells  conceded,  the
    appellant meets the requirements for entry clearance as a partner.

 9. In those circumstances  I  am  satisfied,  as  Mr  Howells  effectively
    conceded, that the refusal of entry  clearance  is  a  disproportionate
    interference with the undoubted (and not challenged)  family  life  the
    appellant enjoys with his spouse in the UK and is, as a consequence,  a
    breach of Art 8 (see TZ (Pakistan) and another v SSHD [2018]  EWCA  Civ
    1109 at [34]).

Decision

10. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal involved the making of an error of law.  I set it aside.

11. I remake the decision allowing the appellant's appeal under  Art  8  of
    the ECHR.

                                                                      Signed
                                                                       [pic]
                                                                     A Grubb
                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal

                                                              9 January 2020


TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Having allowed the appeal on a basis  upon  which  the  First-tier  Tribunal
should also have allowed the appeal, I make a full fee  award  for  any  fee
which has been paid by the appellant.

                                                                      Signed
                                                                       [pic]
                                                                     A Grubb
                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
