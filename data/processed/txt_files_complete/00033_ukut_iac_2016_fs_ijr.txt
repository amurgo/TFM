JUDGE grubb:

1.       In this claim the applicant challenges a decision of the  Secretary
    of State taken on 6 August 2014 refusing to grant her leave outside the
    Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).

 2. The applicant sought leave to continue as a carer of an elderly couple,
    Dr Peter Jost and Mrs Margaret Jost, who are aged respectively  93  and
    91 years of age.  The applicant has been employed since January 2014 as
    their carer, in particular that of Mrs  Jost,  for  whom  she  provides
    overnight care.  Mrs  Jost  suffers  from  Alzheimer's  Disease  and  a
    variety of medical  issues.   There  is  medical  and  other  evidence,
    particularly from Dr Jost himself, supporting her need for 24 hour care
    which is in part provided by the applicant but also  by  others  during
    the day.

Background

 3. The background to the claim is as follows.  The applicant came  to  the
    United Kingdom on 12 December 2006 with a work permit  as  a  qualified
    carer.  She is a Philippine national and is qualified to  degree  level
    as a nurse.  She worked in a nursing home in Dorset and  then  latterly
    in London at  the  Springdene  Nursing  Care  Home  as  a  senior  care
    assistant.  Her leave was extended as a work  permit  holder  for  five
    years from 29 January 2008 to 28 January 2013.

 4. At some point she stopped working for Springdene Nursing Care Home.  As
    a result of that the Secretary of State made a decision to curtail  her
    leave to 26 July 2010.  That decision was taken on 27 May 2010.

 5. In the acknowledgement of  service  the  chronology  records  that  the
    curtailment notice was returned undelivered to the Secretary  of  State
    on 23 June 2010 and there is nothing  in  the  material  before  me  to
    suggest that that is other than what happened.  Although there was some
    discussion before me as to the effect of that curtailment notice if  it
    was undelivered it seems to me that there is  only  one  possible  view
    that can be taken. The applicant's leave was not effectively  curtailed
    by that notice since it was not communicated and  therefore  not  given
    under s.4(1) of the  Immigration  Act  1971.   That  follows  from  the
    decision of this Tribunal in the case of Syed [2013] UKUT  144.   As  a
    consequence the applicant's leave expired naturally on 28 January 2013.



 6. On 5 January 2014 the applicant was employed by Dr and Mrs  Jost  as  a
    carer.  The contract of employment between them is at pages 43 to 46 of
    the trial bundle.  That states that the applicant's  employment  begins
    on 5 January 2014, that she is employed as a carer on an annual  salary
    of ï¿½20,800; her work is for 40 hours per week starting at 4.30  on  all
    days except  Sunday.   In  fact  her  working  week  does  not  include
    Saturday, it is from Sunday to Friday.

 7. In addition, and I will return to this later, there are provisions  for
    holidays, dealing with sickness and other matters which would  normally
    be expected to be seen in a contract of this sort.  Her duties are  set
    out at Appendix 1 to the contract headed "Carer's Duties" and I do  not
    need to refer to them in detail in this judgment  other  than  to  note
    that they primarily deal with Mrs Jost's personal and other  needs  and
    the provision of support and assistance to her and Dr Jost in the  home
    during the applicant's hours of work.

 8. On 30 June 2014 the applicant applied for further leave  based  on  her
    carer's role.  Her application was made outside the  Rules.   That  was
    refused by the Secretary of State on 6 August  2014  and  a  pre-action
    Protocol letter was sent dated  1  September  2014  with  a  pre-action
    Protocol response from the respondent dated  26  September  2014.   The
    claim was then filed on 5 November 2014.

The Respondent's Decision

 9. I begin with the decision of the Secretary  of  State  which  is  under
    challenge dated 6 August 2014 and is at pages 31 to 32 of  the  bundle.
    So far as relevant it provides as follows:

         "You have indicated in Section 3 of your  FLR(O)  application  form
         that you are applying for leave to remain  as  a  domestic  worker.
         However, the  grounds  of  your  application  as  detailed  in  the
         covering letters you have provided  specify  consideration  outside
         the Immigration Rules.  Consideration  as  a  domestic  worker  has
         therefore been disregarded."

   10. The letter then goes on to say:

         "Your representative has stated that you wish to be  granted  leave
         to remain outside the Rules as a carer  of  two  British  citizens.
         The Secretary of State's  policy  is  to  consider  granting  leave
         outside  the  Immigration  Rules  where   particularly   compelling
         circumstances exist.  Grants of such leave are rare and  are  given
         only for genuinely compassionate reasons.

         We have carefully considered your application.  You claim that  you
         are the carer of two elderly British citizens, Dr H Peter Jost  and
         Mrs Margaret Jost, who have multiple health problems.  However, you
         are not the sole carer of the couple.  It is considered  reasonable
         to expect the couple to continue to explore other options for  care
         (for example by means of seeking assistance from family and friends
         or requesting their two other carers to extent their hours into the
         evenings).   Moreover,  your  adverse  immigration  history  weighs
         heavily against you in the consideration of your application.   You
         decided to take up employment in the  United  Kingdom  despite  you
         having no valid leave to enter or remain.

         In view of the above, the Secretary of State is not satisfied  that
         your circumstances are such that  discretion  should  be  exercised
         outside the Immigration Rules."

    As a consequence the applicant's application for leave was refused.

       The Challenge

11. The applicant's grounds challenging the legality of that decision  have
    been somewhat refined since the initial application.  I will return  to
    this in a moment.

12. Permission was initially refused by Upper Tribunal Judge  Eshun  on  11
    June 2015 but was subsequently granted at an oral hearing on  5  August
    2015 by Upper Tribunal Judge Freeman on the ground that  the  Secretary
    of State had given inadequate consideration  to  Mrs  Jost's  situation
    when considering whether they were exceptional circumstances  to  grant
    leave outside the Rules.  The  grant  of  permission  also  raises  the
    prospect of the applicant  claiming  that  the  decision  breached  Mrs
    Jost's human rights, in particular her right under Art 8 to respect for
    her private life.

13. Following that grant of permission the applicant sought  to  amend  her
    grounds to raise three grounds: first that  the  respondent's  decision
    was unlawful on public law grounds, namely a failure  to  consider  all
    relevant considerations and overlook the  relevant  material;  secondly
    that the decision was incompatible with the private life of  Mrs  Jost;
    and thirdly that the Secretary of State had failed to take into account
    a relevant policy, namely her carers policy set out in the IDIs.

14. Mr Symes, who appeared on behalf of the applicant, sought permission to
    amend the applicant's grounds to those and Mr McLellan, who appeared on
    behalf of the Secretary of State, did not oppose that  application.   I
    therefore granted permission during the course of the hearing to  amend
    the grounds to those three grounds.

15. In essence the first ground  is  the  ground  upon  which  UTJ  Freeman
    granted permission.  The second ground raises a  not  obvious  or  easy
    point of law concerning whether an  applicant  can  rely  on  another's
    human rights in a claim such as this.  The  third  ground,  as  I  have
    said, concerns the application of  the  Secretary  of  State's  carers'
    policy and its relevance to this case.   Those  issues  were  helpfully
    developed in the respective arguments  of  Mr  Symes  and  Mr  McLellan
    before me and in their skeleton arguments.

Discussion

16. I will first deal with ground 1, the public  law  challenge.   What  is
    said on behalf of the applicant is that the Secretary of State  in  her
    decision failed fully to take  into  account  the  evidence  both  from
    medical professionals and from Mrs Jost concerning the availability  of
    alternative and adequate care for Mrs Jost if the applicant was  unable
    to provide it.  In addition Mr Symes submitted that  the  Secretary  of
    State was  wrong  to  assert  something  that  was  self-evidently  and
    obviously not the case, namely that others such as relatives, the Josts
    have a daughter, or  neighbours  could  step  into  the  shoes  of  the
    applicant and provide the care required.

17. Mr Symes took me to the relevant material in the bundle.  He took me to
    a number of letters from health professionals, first of  all  a  letter
    from Dr Levy, at pages 59 to  66.   The  initial  letter  is  dated  23
    November 2012 and the more recent letters are dated  20  and  24  March
    2014 and 12 May 2014 respectively.  These letters identify, and  it  is
    not disputed, that Mrs Jost is an  elderly  lady  who  suffers  from  a
    number of conditions  physical  and  mental  including  suffering  from
    Alzheimer's Disease.

18. In his letter of 12 May 2014  Dr  Levy  describes  the  role  that  the
    applicant claims  in  relation  to  Mrs  Jost's  care  overnight.   For
    example, he says that it is particularly  crucial  that  she  is  there
    because "Mrs Jost will often awake to go to the loo in the dark and  in
    a drowsy state, hence probably at her most vulnerable". Dr  Levy  notes
    that the applicant is committed to caring for Mrs  Jost  overnight  and
    that agency carers are a possibility but that they would not be able to
    provide continuity of care which is provided by the applicant.

19. In addition I was referred to a letter from Dr Patel at page 55 of  the
    bundle.  This is a little old in origin, it is dated  25  October  2011
    but again describes Mrs Jost's condition and sets out her  tendency  to
    fall and suffer as a result of her physical and mental difficulties.

20. Dr Jost, Mrs Jost's husband, deals with her condition in his  statement
    which begins at page 36 of the bundle but continues for these  purposes
    at pages 37 to 40 and it is important that I  set  these  out  in  some
    detail.

         "My wife is now incapacitated to the extent that  she  cannot  move
         around without help nor attend to her daily  needs.   She  requires
         near  24  hour  attention  (see  list  of  medical  attention   and
         medication).  One of her biggest problems is that she is  not  only
         weak, but struggling to  communicate  her  needs,  including  those
         relating to pain, which she suffers bravely and without  complaint.
         By nature, not deliberately, she finds it difficult in her  present
         condition to  communicate  even  with  a  doctor  or  myself.   Her
         previous doctor, Dr Thwaites, who retired  three  months  ago,  was
         intuitive and thus managed to help her in spite of her difficulties
         of communication.

         During the day she is being attended to by a carer friend and  also
         by a neighbour, both of whom have families.  In the evenings and at
         night she is being looked after by Florentina Sison.

         I would like to be able to look after her at night, but  am  unable
         to hear her when she calls out at night  as  I  wear  hearing  aids
         which are taken out at night.  Also, to enable me to sleep, I  have
         been prescribed nitrazepam.  I am, therefore, unable to  attend  to
         her requirements during the night.

         Furthermore at 93 years of age, I do not have the strength to  lift
         her should she fall.  This has happened, when I have had  to  raise
         her onto a chair by lifting  her  successively  with  the  help  of
         mainly telephone directories until the seating height was  reached.
         This was not good for her health or her dignity and took  me  about
         half an hour of really hard, physical work.

         Starting when she was in a better state than she is  now,  my  wife
         has,  over  a  period  of  time,  become  very   comfortable   with
         Florentina's care.  She trusts her totally and feels  safe  in  her
         care.  Her approach is highly professional, whilst at the same time
         very caring, assuring her dignity is maintained at all times.

         Above all, Florentina has come to understand my wife when she is in
         pain or wants something.  Over the time she has spent with her, she
         has come to understand what my wife needs, even when my wife cannot
         talk and express herself adequately.   This  is  a  most  important
         feature of their relationship, which cannot be overstated.

         She is medically qualified  to  the  required  degree,  which  will
         become more and more important, as with age, my  wife's  health  is
         unlikely to improve significantly.   Furthermore,  my  wife  and  I
         trust Florentina implicitly with our home and possessions  -  again
         an important reassurance for my wife.  Anyone new would  upset  her
         and have detrimental effects, as was occasioned during  our  week's
         visit to  the  BUPA  owned  Richmond  Retreat  at  Letcombe  Regis,
         Oxfordshire.

         My wife knows that  Florentina  also  keeps  an  eye  on  me.   The
         knowledge that I have been looked  after  -  when  needed  -  is  a
         significant reassurance to my wife and helps to maintain her  peace
         of mind and confidence.

         My wife's condition has deteriorated during the  past  six  months.
         In her present condition, neither she nor I (at 93) could  train  a
         new night time carer, even if we could find one  who  satisfied  my
         wife's unusually medical-based needs which we have not been able to
         obtain."

21. Then, shortly after Dr Jost goes on to state:

         "Permanency is essential as my wife  could  not  cope  with  a  new
         (stranger) carer.  Having to  do  so  could  be  nothing  short  of
         catastrophic."

22. It is accepted by the Secretary of State that the respondent must  take
    account of the impact upon Mrs Jost, and indeed Dr Jost, to the  extent
    that is relied on, in deciding whether to exercise  discretion  outside
    the Rules.

23. The claim was initially put both under the Rules, under Art  8  relying
    upon the applicant's Art 8  rights  and  also  upon  an  argument  that
    discretion should be exercised beyond Art 8 outside the Rules.  In  the
    amended grounds, and Mr Symes made this clear at the hearing today,  it
    is no  longer  suggested  that  the  applicant's  Art  8  rights  would
    themselves be breached by the respondent's decision nor is it suggested
    that the applicant could succeed under any of the Immigration Rules.

24. When one looks at the respondent's decision  it  is  relatively  brief.
    The Secretary of State nevertheless  has,  in  my  judgement,  lawfully
    considered the circumstances of the applicant and  perhaps  principally
    that of Dr and Mrs Jost.  She has  considered  whether  there  are  any
    compelling circumstances to justify the  grant  of  leave  outside  the
    Rules.  She recognises that the Josts are two elderly people  for  whom
    the applicant provides care.  She also notes that Mrs Jost has a number
    of health problems.

25. The applicant is not, as the Secretary of State noted, the  sole  carer
    of Mrs Jost.  There are other carers in  the  day.   The  Secretary  of
    State took into account the possibility that adequate alternative  care
    could be obtained other than from the applicant.  It was  part  of  the
    evidence that an advert had been placed - and the advert is before me -
    in the Hendon and Finchley Times on 1 May 2014  for  a  carer  for  Mrs
    Jost.  The evidence also was that there was only one applicant and  who
    was in the circumstances not appropriate for the post.

26. Nevertheless the Secretary of State was entitled to take into  account,
    in my view, and clearly did  take  into  account  that  the  option  of
    obtaining an alternative carer had not been fully exhausted yet.  There
    was no evidence, for example, that any other adverts  had  been  placed
    and further efforts had been made to obtain other  carers.   Dr  Jost's
    own evidence that former carers had been  employed  who  were  adequate
    albeit that some who had been employed turned out not to be  inadequate
    is entirely consistent with  the  respondent's  view  that  alternative
    carers could be sought and there was every  possibility  that  in  time
    they could be obtained.  One of the previous carers  was  described  as
    being very good.

27. None of the medical  or  other  evidence,  in  my  view,  required  the
    Secretary of State to conclude that only the applicant was an  adequate
    carer for Mrs Jost.  Dr Levy does, as I have already pointed out, speak
    of the importance of continuity but also recognises that agency  carers
    could, at least in the short term,  provide  some  care  satisfactorily
    whilst further advertisements were placed.  It was not unreasonable, in
    my judgement, for the Secretary of State to consider that the applicant
    might obtain a carer who could step into the shoes currently filled  by
    the applicant and not take the view that the applicant was the only one
    who in the short or long term could provide adequate  support  for  Mrs
    Jost at night.

28. It is worth noting that the applicant  had  only  been  employed  since
    early January 2014.  She does not work seven days a week  and  she  has
    over five weeks' paid  annual  leave  each  year  when  the  employment
    contract recognises that with notice she may take periods of  leave  so
    that "where necessary alternative arrangements with care providers  can
    be put in place".  Plainly, the Josts themselves have  contemplated  an
    alternative carer being engaged when the applicant was on leave.

29. It is also the case  that,  although  the  applicant's  care  currently
    provided is said to be essential and unique,  at  any  time  she  could
    herself leave the employment of the Josts.

30. In my judgement, it was properly open to  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    conclude that the applicant's care was not essential in the sense  that
    it was the only adequate care which could be provided to Mrs Jost.  The
    Secretary  of  State,  having  taken  into  account  the  evidence  and
    considered Mrs Jost's needs, and I am satisfied that the  Secretary  of
    State has fully given her mind to the relevant evidence, her conclusion
    was not unlawful on public law grounds.

31. It was, in my judgement, not necessary for the Secretary of State in an
    administrative decision to set out seriatim each  and  every  piece  of
    evidence and deal with every matter that might more likely be  expected
    in a judicial decision.  The  Secretary  of  State  gave  adequate  and
    wholly sustainable reasons in law  for  her  view  that  they  were  no
    compelling or compassionate circumstances to justify the grant of leave
    outside the Rules.  The decision, of course, properly took into account
    the public interest in that the applicant had no lawful basis for being
    in the UK since 28 January 2013.  Her relationship with  Mrs  Jost  had
    been formed wholly during the period in which she had no  lawful  basis
    for being in the UK or indeed for working with the Josts.

32. For those reasons I reject ground 1.

33. It is convenient now to deal with ground 3, namely the policy  argument
    raised on behalf of the applicant.  In its initial guise  the  argument
    put forward in the skeleton argument by Mr Symes was  that  the  policy
    was directly applicable to  the  applicant.   That  is  not  a  tenable
    position and Mr Symes did not pursue that argument  before  me  at  the
    hearing.

34. The argument was based upon the terms of the policy  which  applies  to
    carers of an  individual  who  are  that  individual's  "relatives"  or
    "friends". Self-evidently the applicant is not Mrs  Jost's  "relative".
    The argument that she was or is her "friend" does not  stand  up.   The
    policy is not concerned with a carer who is employed by an  individual.
    It is concerned with those who voluntarily provide  on  an  exceptional
    basis support for a person with whom they have an existing  friendship.
    It cannot apply to the applicant.  I need say no more about this  given
    that Mr Symes did not pursue that point before me.

35. Instead, Mr Symes submitted that the policy should apply by analogy and
    its terms should apply so that the nature of the matters that should be
    considered should be considered for consistency  purposes  even  though
    the applicant was neither a relative nor a friend.

36. As Mr McLellan submitted there is no  sound  basis  for  a  consistency
    argument here.  The policy  is  not  concerned  with  workers.   It  is
    concerned  with  the  voluntary  provision  of  care  by  friends   and
    relatives.  The consistency, if any, in any decision-making would be to
    compare the applicant's situation with other  workers  covered  by  the
    Rules rather than other care providers.  In any  event,  even  if  that
    were not right the terms of the policy are such that in my judgement it
    could not rationally apply so as to benefit the applicant.

37. In para 17.9 headed "Leave to remain as carers for friends of a sick or
    disabled person" it is stated that leave to remain in order to care for
    a sick or disabled friend should "normally be refused".  The  provision
    then goes on to state that in "an emergency" where there is no-one else
    to care for the individual it may be appropriate to grant leave.

38. As the guidance point out, normally leave  in  this  context  would  be
    refused even to a friend. In my judgement it cannot rationally be  said
    that there was  an  emergency  in  this  case  given  the  prospect  of
    potential support and care  from  others  that  could  be  obtained  if
    further efforts were made to seek it.

39. For those reasons therefore nothing in the carers' policy  assists  the
    applicant to demonstrate that the Secretary  of  State's  decision  was
    unlawful.

40. Finally then I turn to the second ground,  namely  that  the  applicant
    says that the Secretary of State has failed  to  consider  whether  her
    decision not to grant her leave breached the Art 8 rights, the  respect
    for private life, of Dr and Mrs Jost, in particular Mrs Jost.  Reliance
    is placed by the applicant on s.6 of the Human Rights  Act  1998  which
    provides in s.6(1):

         "It is unlawful for a public authority to act in  a  way  which  is
         incompatible with a Convention right."

41. Mr Symes submitted that the Secretary of  State's  decision  must  take
    account of the fact that the decision might be  incompatible  with  Mrs
    Jost's Art 8 right to respect for her private life.  He placed reliance
    upon the decision of the House of Lords in Beoku-Betts v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 39 where the House  of  Lords
    held that, at least in the appellate context,  a  Tribunal  hearing  an
    appeal by an individual who relies upon his  or  her  Art  8  right  to
    respect for their family life should consider the family as a unit  and
    consider the impact upon the family life of the other members  of  that
    family unit.

42. In this case the applicant relies on the impact on Mrs Jost in  respect
    of her needs and the impact on her of the loss of a carer  and  submits
    that that falls within the ambit of her private life (see, for example,
    Pretty v UK [2002] 35 EHRR 1, at para 65).

43. In response Mr McLellan  submitted  that  Beoku-Betts  cannot  be  read
    across from a claim based on family life to one based on private  life.
    Whilst a family may form a unit there is no equivalent comparator  that
    can be used in private life.  Likewise he relies upon s.7 of the  Human
    Rights Act 1998 which states, so far as relevant in s.7(1):

         "A person who claims that a public authority has acted (or proposes
         to act) in a way which is made unlawful by s.6(1) may -

         ...

         (b)  rely on the Convention right or rights concerned in any  legal
             proceedings,

         but only if he is (or would be) a victim of the unlawful act."

44. In this case Mr McLellan submitted that the applicant cannot be said to
    be a "victim" of the unlawful act if there is a breach  of  Mrs  Jost's
    Art 8 right to respect for her private life.   He  submitted  that  the
    underlying purpose of the legislation was to restrict a court's enquiry
    into the rights of the individual who  suffered  the  breach  of  those
    rights rather than allowing  a  third  party  to  do  so  such  as  the
    applicant in this case.

45. In any event, he submitted that there was no private life  between  the
    applicant and Mrs Jost that was engaged.  Finally,  he  submitted  that
    even if it was engaged then the public interest given  the  applicant's
    immigration history outweighed any interference of Mrs  Jost's  private
    life so as to justify a breach of her Art 8 rights.

46. This is a point which as far as I am  aware  has  not  previously  been
    decided by this Tribunal or the Administrative Court  or  other  higher
    court.  Beoku-Betts is undoubtedly a case about family life but  I  see
    no  reason  in  principle  why  private  life  existing   between   two
    individuals cannot be seen in  the  same  way  as  family  life  in  an
    appropriate  case.   For  example  usually,  unless  there   are   some
    exceptional circumstances, adult siblings will not have a  family  life
    between them but they will have private life and if one of them was  to
    be subject to removal it would seem to me rather  odd  if  their  joint
    private life could not be considered following the approach  in  Beoku-
    Betts in determining whether or not the removal of one of  them  was  a
    breach of Art 8.  Likewise therefore the disruption to the relationship
    between the applicant and Mrs Jost and the impact upon Mrs  Jost  would
    seem to me potentially to be a matter which should be considered by the
    Secretary of State as the initial decision maker in determining whether
    the applicant should be refused leave.

47. Beoku-Betts is, in my judgement,  inconsistent  with  the  respondent's
    argument that Mrs Jost's private life rights cannot be  examined  in  a
    claim by the applicant because Mrs Jost cannot be a "victim" under  s.7
    of the Human Rights Act.  Although Mr McLellan submitted otherwise,  in
    para 43 of his speech in Beoku-Betts Lord  Brown,  having  adopted  the
    approach of considering the family as a unit and that, at least in  the
    appellate context, a Tribunal should consider the Art 8 rights  of  all
    family members, concluded that "then each affected family member is  to
    be regarded as a victim".  Mutatis mutandis the applicant is a "victim"
    if the private life of Mrs Jost is being considered.

48. Likewise some of the points made by Lord Brown in paras 42  and  43  of
    his speech, telling in favour of a wide  approach  to  considering  the
    rights of others  affected,  appear  to  be  equally  applicable  here:
    namely, the need to avoid multiple challenges and also  accepting  that
    the obligation to consider an individual's family life even if  not  of
    the applicant was a matter that would, if left to multiple  actions  or
    such that could not be considered  in  a  single  instance,  not  be  a
    position that Parliament in the appeal  context  contemplated.   Whilst
    that was said in the context of an appellate tribunal's role, it cannot
    be so limited.  In para 43 of his speech when coming to that conclusion
    Lord Brown rhetorically sated:

         "would it not be strange too that the Secretary of State  (and  the
         Strasbourg Court) should have to approach  the  appellant's  Art  8
         claim to remain on one basis, namely considering all the rights but
         the appellate authorities on another?" (emphasis added)

49. Patently, there Lord Brown  considered  that  the  Secretary  of  State
    should consider all the rights of all  the  relevant  individuals  when
    family life was relied upon.

50. For the purposes of this  claim,  I  am  content  to  accept  that  the
    applicant's arguments on this point are right.

51. Further, I do not accept Mr McLellan's submission based upon  case  law
    concerning working relationships (e.g. Sidabras v Lithuania  (2006)  42
    EHHR 6) that a situation such as that between  the  applicant  and  Mrs
    Jost cannot give rise to private life.  Clearly, the  present  case  is
    potentially a different  sort  of  situation  from  a  pure  employment
    relationship but, even there, relationships formed during the course of
    employment may give rise to 'private life'  (see,  Niemietz  v  Germany
    (1992)  16  EHRR  97  at  [29]).   Most   importantly,   however,   the
    respondent's argument fails to have  regard  to  the  impact  upon  Mrs
    Jost's well-being and health which, in my judgement, undoubtedly  falls
    within the purview of an individual's private  life  as  recognised  in
    cases such as Pretty v UK (2002) 35 EHRR 1 and R(Razgar) v SSHD  [2004]
    UKHL 27.

52. I am content to accept the applicant's argument that Art 8.1 is engaged
    if Mrs Jost's private life right is  considered  under  Art  8.   I  am
    content to do so because even if  it  is  correct  (and  I  express  no
    concluded view) in my judgement the applicant has failed to  show  that
    the decision breaches Mrs Jost's Art 8 right.

53. I do not repeat the factors that  I  have  already  set  out  above  in
    considering ground 1 and whether there were "compelling" circumstances:
    they are equally applicable here.   The availability  and  adequacy  of
    alternative carers for Mrs Jost were matters which  I  have  considered
    under ground 1.  The Secretary of  State  was  entitled  to  reach  the
    conclusion that the position was not as put forward  by  the  applicant
    and support could be obtained.  In addition,  there  is  a  significant
    public interest which weighed against any interference with Mrs  Jost's
    rights even if it can be said that Art 8.1 is  engaged.  The  applicant
    has no leave - it expired in January 2013 - and has no basis under  the
    Rules or policy to remain as a  carer  or  on  any  other  basis.   The
    respondent is entitled to give that considerable weight such  that  any
    interference with Mrs Jost's private life would be proportionate.   For
    those reasons therefore I also reject ground 2.

54. Before I conclude this judgment the circumstances of Dr and  Mrs  Jost,
    especially Mrs Jost, are worthy of the empathy and respect for how they
    cope with their lives.  It is entirely understandable that they  should
    want to retain the applicant, who has proved herself as a carer of  Mrs
    Jost in particular.  This Tribunal, however, can  only  interfere  with
    the respondent's decision if it is unlawful.  The circumstances falling
    as they do outside the Rules and the carers' policy are such that I  am
    unable  to  say  that  the  respondent's  decision  was  irrational  or
    otherwise unlawful on public law  principles  or  breached  Mrs  Jost's
    rights.

55. For those reasons this claim for judicial review is dismissed.

Costs

56. I make an order for costs in favour of the respondent for a  figure  to
    be provided  reflecting  the  total  of  ï¿½8,788  and  whatever  is  the
    appropriate VAT. (Subsequent to the hearing a  revised  costs  schedule
    was submitted by the respondent and I make an order  for  costs  to  be
    paid by the applicant in the sum of ï¿½9,618.00.)

57. No application for permission to appeal was made.  I am  not  going  to
    grant permission to appeal.  It does not seem to me  that  my  judgment
    discloses any arguable error of law or there is any other  good  reason
    to grant permission.~~~0~~~~
