Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Shiliday (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Ms Appiah, Counsel, instructed by Vine Court
Chambers


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The appellant is a  citizen  of  the  Philippines.  The  appellant  was
    granted leave to join his parents and his visa was valid between  March
    7, 2008 and September 30, 2009.   On  September  21,  2009  he  applied
    outside of the Immigration Rules and this was granted until  April  23,
    2010 and allowed him to remain until October 29, 2011. On  October  27,
    2011 he again applied to for leave to remain outside of the Immigration
    Rules but this was refused on  February  28,  2012.  He  appealed  that
    decision and the appeal came before Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Coutts on May  14,  2012.  He  dismissed  the  appeal  because  he  was
    satisfied there was no decision to appeal because the appellant already
    had indefinite leave to remain.

 3. On June 12,  2012  he  submitted  an  application  to  remain  but  the
    respondent refused the application on June 27, 2013 and on December 23,
    2013 he was served with form IS151A as an overstayer.

 4. On January 21, 2014 he submitted  an  application  on  Form  FLR(M)  to
    remain as the partner of a person present and  settled  in  the  United
    Kingdom. The respondent refused the application on March 6, 2014 and on
    March 25, 2014 the  appellant  appealed  under  section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 5. The matter came before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Onoufriou
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") on October 15, 2014  and  in  a
    decision promulgated on October 24, 2014 he dismissed the appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules but allowed it under Article 8 ECHR.

 6. The respondent  lodged  grounds  of  appeal  on  October29,  2014.  She
    submitted the FtTJ erred by allowing  the  appellant's  appeal  on  the
    basis that Article 8 is a general dispensing power.

 7. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Foudy granted permission to appeal  on
    December 10, 2014 stating there was an arguable error in law  based  on
    the grounds.

 8. The appellant was in attendance in court and was represented as set out
    above.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

 9. Mr Shiliday submitted paragraph [17] of the  FtTJ's  determination  was
    crucial as the FtTJ had treated Article 8 as a general dispensing power
    and that  was  wrong  in  law.  The  FtTJ  failed  to  have  regard  to
    proportionality and the  fact  the  appellant  could  not  satisfy  the
    Immigration Rules and he failed to consider that they could live in the
    Philippines. The appellant  could  have  left  and  applied  for  entry
    clearance and there was no basis in law to allow the appeal on  Article
    8 grounds as there were no exceptional circumstances that would  result
    in an unjustifiable harsh outcome.

10. Ms Appiah agreed the key paragraph of the determination  was  paragraph
    [17] but she  submitted  the  FtTJ  did  consider  everything  in  that
    paragraph.  The  FtTJ  took  into  account  the  appellant's   family's
    immigration history and made findings open to him.  Even  if  the  FtTJ
    erred in his approach it was not material for the reasons given by  the
    FtTJ.

11. Mr Shiliday maintained the error was material and the  decision  should
    be remade and dismissed. Ms Appiah agreed that if there was an error in
    law then the  decision  could  be  remade  today  without  any  further
    submissions or evidence.

12. I reserved my decision and indicated I would give a written decision in
    the next few days.

    ERROR OF LAW ASSESSMENT

13. The appellant had applied to remain as a partner of  a  person  present
    and settled in the United Kingdom. His application was made outside  of
    the Immigration Rules. The FtTJ had the  appellant's  and  respondent's
    bundle of  documents  and  contained  within  those  bundles  were  the
    determination of Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Coutts  and  the
    accompanying letter attached to this application.

14. At paragraph [4]  of  the  appellant's  representative's  letter  dated
    January 20, 2014 the representative criticised the Home office for  not
    appealing or clarifying the Tribunal decision of Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Coutts. The reality is Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Coutts erred in his approach in finding the  appellant  had  indefinite
    leave but he dismissed the appeal  albeit  for  the  wrong  reason.  If
    anyone should have appealed it should have been the appellant as it was
    his application that had been dismissed.

15. Nevertheless  the  matter  came  before  the  FtTJ  and  he  noted  the
    immigration  history  and  also  recorded  in  his  findings  that  the
    appellant did not meet the Immigration Rules. Clearly in his  mind  was
    the fact the appellant had been misled but I am satisfied Mr Shiliday's
    submissions have some force. At no point  did  the  FtTJ  carry  out  a
    proportionality assessment in paragraph [17] of his  determination  and
    consider whether there were exceptional circumstances that would result
    in an unjustifiable harsh outcome. That  is  a  material  error  as  it
    fundamental to any assessment and I therefore set  aside  the  original
    decision.

    REMAKING OF DECISION

16. The appellant, it seems, came to the United Kingdom as a  minor  albeit
    by the time his  application  was  allowed  he  was  over  the  age  of
    eighteen. His leave was limited and the respondent extended that  leave
    until October 29,  2011.  According  to  the  appellant's  own  witness
    statement that application was  submitted  on  the  basis  he  was  his
    mother's dependent and his father also submitted a spousal application.
    The appellant accepted that the respondent granted him  leave  in  line
    with his father's leave and that was until October 29, 2011. His father
    only had limited leave  to  remain  so  I  find  it  strange  that  the
    appellant would have believed he had indefinite leave bearing  in  mind
    his leave was for a fixed period.

17. The appellant then applied to extend that leave but  this  was  refused
    and for the reasons set out above it came before Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Coutts. The appellant did not appeal  that  decision  but
    according to his statement believed he had indefinite leave  to  remain
    but the Home Office did not agree with what the appellant  thought  and
    did not issue him with the documentation he sought.

18. There appears no dispute that his situation has changed since he  first
    came to this country. He came as a dependant and whilst here he met his
    partner with whom he now lives. She is also from  the  Philippines  but
    has status here due to her parent's former status as  domestic  workers
    and she is now a British citizen.

19. I have before me a statement from his partner and she states that since
    July 30, 2013 they have lived  together  in  their  own  home.  She  is
    employed and provided evidence of her income that shows she is paid  an
    annual salary (grossed up) of �22,414. The appellant does not appear to
    work presumably because of his status.

20. The respondent considered family life under the  Immigration  Rules  in
    her refusal letter and concluded he could not succeed  under  paragraph
    EX.1 because there were no "insurmountable obstacles"  to  family  life
    continuing in the Philippines. His claim  under  paragraph  276ADE  was
    rejected because he could not show he did not have any social, cultural
    or family ties to the Philippines. Ms Appiah did not disagree with this
    in the First-tier or before me.

21. Following a long line of cases a Tribunal  should  consider  the  claim
    outside of the Immigration Rules if ultimately  there  are  exceptional
    circumstances that would result in an unjustifiable harsh outcome.

22. I have to have regard to the fact the appellant's mother lives here  as
    does the appellant's partner and her family. They are all  entitled  to
    live in the United Kingdom because they either have indefinite leave to
    remain or are now British citizens. I also have regard to the fact that
    the appellant is in a subsisting relationship.

23. The FtTJ failed to consider the respondent's  arguments  when  allowing
    the appeal under Article 8 ECHR. These arguments can be  summarised  as
    follows:

      a.  The  appellant  has  lived  the  majority  of  his  life  in   the
         Philippines.

      b. His partner is also from the Philippines but came to  this  country
         as a dependant of her parents.

      c. Both have extended family that live in the Philippines.

      d. The appellant did not meet the Immigration Rules.

      e. He became an overstayer once his appeal rights  were  exhausted  in
         May 2012.

      f. Even if there was some confusion the appellant was  aware  that  he
         had not been granted indefinite leave as the authorities refused to
         issue him with the appropriate paperwork and Judge  of  the  First-
         tier Tribunal Coutts dismissed his appeal in any event in 2012.

      g. The appellant has continued his relationship despite the precarious
         nature of his status.

      h. It was open to him to make the appropriate  application  for  entry
         clearance and as long as he satisfied the requirements  of  Section
         EC-P of Appendix FM he would be granted entry clearance.

      i. There was nothing  exceptional  about  his  case  that  would  mean
         removal would lead to unjustifiably harsh consequences.

24. The situation is unfortunate for the appellant as I agree with the FtTJ
    that the appellant has not set about staying  here  illegally.  I  find
    that he has not sought to hide from the authorities  but  has  in  fact
    sought to regularise his status. A logical conclusion of  that  finding
    is he was aware he did not have indefinite leave to remain.

25. The positive aspects of his case are as set out by  Ms  Appiah  in  her
    arguments made both to the FtTJ and  myself.  I  also  have  looked  at
    Section 117B of the  2002  Act  (as  inserted  by  Section  19  of  the
    Immigration Act 2014). In particular I have regard to the following:

      a. The maintenance of immigration control is in the public interest

      b. The appellant's partner can support him as she earns  over  �18,600
         and consequently he would not be a burden on the tax payers.

      c. The relationship began when he was here legally. They  met  in  May
         2009 and began living together at his mother's flat in  July  2009.
         The appellant was lawfully here until his  rights  of  appeal  were
         exhausted in May 2012.

      d. Since May 2012 his status has been precarious as evidenced  by  the
         fact he has made two applications outside of the Rules to  try  and
         stay here.

26. If the appellant had demonstrated  insurmountable  obstacles  or  shown
    that he did not have  any  social,  cultural  or  family  ties  to  the
    Philippines then he would have succeeded under the Rules. Article 8  is
    not meant to be a short cut or a direct alternative to the  Rules.  The
    appellant has to demonstrate that removal would lead  to  unjustifiably
    harsh consequences and I  am  not  satisfied  this  is  the  case.  The
    appellant has ties to the Philippines and his partner is also from that
    country. The consequences of removal would be that the appellant  would
    have to make an application for entry clearance and  if  he  meets  the
    Rules his appeal would be allowed. There is nothing  exceptional  about
    the appellant's circumstances and I dismiss the appeal under Article  8
    ECHR.

Decision

27. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did disclose an error in law. I
    set aside the decision allowing the appeal  under  Article  8  ECHR.  I
    remake that decision and dismiss the appeal.

28. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended)  an  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order was made in the First-tier and I see  no  reason  to  amend  that
    order.
