Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr J Siri, Counsel instructed by Marsh & Partners
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is a national of Nigeria born on 23 January 1972. He
   entered the UK, and claimed asylum, on 15 September 1997. His asylum
   application was refused on 13 December 1998 and he remained in the UK
   thereafter unlawfully.

2. On 26 June 2012 the appellant made submissions to be granted leave to
   remain pursuant to Paragraph 276B(i)(b) of the Immigration Rules (14 year
   continuous residence in the UK).

3. On 3 December 2014 a decision was made by the respondent to refuse the
   appellant's application for asylum and to remove him as an illegal
   entrant by way of directions under paragraph 8-10 of schedule 2 to the
   Immigration Act 1971.  The decision also considered the appellant's
   family and private life, and concluded that his removal from the UK would
   not be contrary to Article 8 ECHR.  With respect to the further
   submissions made on 26 June 2012, the refusal letter states: "It is noted
   that you have been awaiting a decision on your further submissions of
   26/6/2012 for 2 and a half years." It then says:

         "Overall, on assessing the underlying causes for your length of
         residence in the UK it is found that the vast majority of your time
         has been within your control and that you have intentionally
         avoided the UK's immigration authorities in order to prolong that
         residence"

4. The respondent's refusal letter did not refer to Paragraph 276B(i)(b) of
   the Rules.

5. The appellant's appeal came before First-tier Tribunal ("FtT") Judge
   Eban who, in a decision promulgated on 7 January 2016, dismissed the
   appeal. The appellant did not pursue the asylum claim and the only issue
   considered by Judge Eban was the appellant's private and family life in
   the UK. The judge first considered whether the appellant was able to
   satisfy Paragraph 276ADE and having found that he could not the judge
   proceeded to consider - and reject - the appellant's appeal under Article
   8 ECHR outside the Immigration Rules. No reference was made, or
   consideration given, to Paragraph 276B(i)(b).

6. The grounds of appeal raise a single issue: that the judge and
   respondent should have considered the appellant's claim under Paragraph
   276B(i)(b).

7. Paragraph 276B(i)(b) was withdrawn on 9 July 2012 and no new
   applications could be made under it after that date. It provided a route
   to settlement in the UK after 14 years' continuous residence, even if
   unlawful, where, having regard to the public interest, there were no
   reasons why it would be undesirable for the applicant to be given
   indefinite leave to remain. The Rule set out a number of factors for the
   respondent to take into consideration.

8. At the error of law hearing Mr Tufan handed me a copy of the Immigration
   Directorate Instructions Family Migration: Chapter 8 Transitional
   Provisions: Family members under Part 8 and Appendix FM of the
   Immigration Rules dated August 2015 ("The Instructions").  This states as
   follows:

         9.2 14 Year Long Residence
         9.2.1. Paragraph 276B(i)(b) of the Immigration Rules, which
         provided a route to apply for settlement in the UK after 14 years'
         residence, lawful or unlawful, was withdrawn on 9 July 2012.
         9.2.2. No new applications may be made under paragraph 276B(i)(b)
         from 9 July 2012.
         9.2.3. Applications made under paragraph 276B(i)(b) which were made
         before, but not decided by, 9 July 2012 , and reconsiderations,
         will be decided or reconsidered in accordance with that paragraph.
         9.2.4. Paragraph 276A2 of the Rules was amended on 6 September
         2012. This now provides that a person granted an extension of stay
         on the basis of Long Residence following an application made before
         9 July 2012 will remain subject to the Rules in force on 8 July
         2012. They will therefore be eligible to apply for indefinite leave
         to remain in the UK on the basis of 14 years' Long Residence under
         paragraph 276C if they meet the requirements of paragraph 276B.


9. It is clear from paragraph 9.2.3 of The Instructions that an application
   for settlement on the basis of 14 years residence will be decided in
   accordance with Paragraph 276B(i)(b) of the Rules where it is made
   before, but not decided by, 9 July 2012.

10. Mr Tufan acknowledged that paragraph 9.2.3 was applicable in this
   appeal and that the appellant should succeed by reference to it because
   the appellant's application was made on 26 June 2012 and not decided
   before 9 July 2012. Accordingly, in accordance with The Instructions, the
   respondent was required to determine the appellant's application for
   leave to remain under Paragraph 276B(i)(b). No such determination has yet
   been made.

11. Accordingly, the decision of the FtT is set aside as the judge made a
   material error of law by failing to consider whether the respondent was
   required to determine the appellant's application under Paragraph
   276B(i)(b).

12. I remake the decision by allowing the appellant's appeal to the limited
   extent that the respondent's decision of 3 December 2014 was not in
   accordance with the law and the appellant's application for indefinite
   leave to remain in the UK on the ground of long residence under the rule
   in force until 9 July 2012 remains outstanding for a lawful decision to
   be made.

Decision

13. The decision of the FtT contains a material error of law and is set
   aside.

14. I remake the decision by allowing the appeal to the limited extent that
   the appellant's application under Paragraph 276B(i)(b) remains
   outstanding for a lawful decision by the respondent to be made.
