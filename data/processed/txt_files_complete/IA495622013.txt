For the appellant:     Mr S Karim, instructed by MA Consultants
For the respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Hemal Arvindbhai Suthar, date of  birth  14.5.89,  is  a
    citizen of India.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Dean  promulgated  2.9.14,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent, dated 6.11.13 to refuse his application for
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 student.  The Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    20.8.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth granted permission to appeal  on
    17.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 11.12.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.


Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Dean should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal can be summarised as follows. The
    appellant was last granted leave following his application  on  11.1.12
    for entry clearance as a Tier 4 (General) Student migrant,  with  leave
    to study at South Thames  College  (STC).  His  leave  was  limited  to
    7.6.13. However, the appellant did not study  at  STC  but  on  14.3.12
    began a course of study with  London  College  of  Business  Management
    (LCBM).

 7. His application for further leave to remain drew to  the  attention  of
    the Secretary of State that he had changed colleges without  permission
    and as of 7.6.13 was studying  at  LCBM.  Section  50  of  the  Borders
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 prohibits  a  student  from  study
    other than at the institution that the Confirmation of  Acceptance  for
    Studies (CAS) records as his sponsor. If he decides to switch colleges,
    he is required to make a fresh application for leave to remain.  Having
    failed to do so, the application was  refused  under  paragraph  322(3)
    with reference to paragraph 245ZW(c)(iv), on the basis  of  failure  to
    comply with a condition of his leave.

 8. Judge Dean found that  the  appellant  had  failed  to  comply  with  a
    condition of his leave and and dismissed the appeal.

 9. In  granting  permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Hollingworth  found,  "An
    arguable error of law has arisen in relation to the application of  the
    doctrine of fairness. An arguable error  of  law  also  arises  in  the
    context of proof of the conditions actually imposed in the light of the
    Judge's references to the position at  paragraphs  11  and  13  of  the
    determination."

10. The grounds of application for permission to appeal assert that section
    50 only provides that conditions restricting studies may be imposed and
    thus it is for the Secretary of State to prove that there  was  such  a
    condition  on  the  appellant's  licence.   Given   reliance   on   the
    discretionary ground under paragraph 322(3) to refuse  the  application
    and the assertion that the appellant had breached a  condition  of  his
    licence, it is for the Secretary of State to demonstrate not only  that
    there was a breach but that the discretion had been exercised  to  rely
    on paragraph 322(3).  Thus it is submitted that the judge was in  error
    to state that the burden of proof was on the appellant.

11. It is further submitted that the judge was in error to rely on the Tier
    4 Guidance, which did not have the force of  law,  following  Alvi  and
    Pankina. Finally, it is asserted that the judge  failed  to  take  into
    account the principle of fairness arising from  LCBM  allowing  him  to
    study at their  college  when  he  was  in  alleged  breach  of  leave,
    especially when they issued a letter stating that no visa was required.



12. The Rule 24 response, dated 20.11.14, asserts that the refusal  was  in
    accordance with  the  Rules,  the  appellant  having  changed  colleges
    without permission and that he should have made  a  fresh  application.
    The case of Afzaal [2014] EWCH 2215 (Admin), in particular  at  �40  to
    �47, makes it clear that such restrictions are routinely  and  normally
    imposed.

13. Mr Karim drew my attention to the case of Bhimani  (Student:  Switching
    Institution:  Requirements)  [2014]  UKUT  00516  (IAC),  where   Upper
    Tribunal Judge Allen held that where a  student  chooses  to  study  at
    another institution holding a different  sponsor  licence  number  from
    that of the institution where he was granted leave to remain to  study,
    he is required to make a fresh application.

14. The situation of the appellant in that case was  very  similar  to  the
    appellant. It was when applying for further leave to  remain  that  the
    appellant provided an academic transcript showing he had been  studying
    at a different college to the one for which he had been  granted  leave
    for study. The application in Bhimani was also refused under  paragraph
    322(3). The First-tier Tribunal Judge in that case found there  was  no
    evidence that a condition restricting institution  of  study  had  been
    attached to the appellant's leave  and  therefore  concluded  that  the
    decision was not in accordance with the law and had to  be  set  aside.
    The judge also found, in the alternative, that the language used in the
    refusal  decision  did  not   demonstrate   that   the   decision-maker
    appreciated that there was a discretion and it had not been shown  that
    the discretion had been exercised. The appeal was allowed.

15. On appeal to the Upper Tribunal, Judge Allen  held  that  when  granted
    leave  conditions  may  be  imposed  under  section  3(3)(a)   of   the
    Immigration Act 1971. The effect of paragraph 245ZW(c)(iv)(1)  is  that
    leave granted to a Tier 4 (General) Student will be granted subject  to
    conditions, including the requirement that the student is  not  allowed
    to study except at the institution  which  the  CAS  records  as  their
    sponsor. The judge pointed out that the entry  clearance  reference  is
    the CAS number and  this  should  be  read  as  the  endorsement  of  a
    condition to which leave is subject,  i.e.  study  at  the  college  in
    respect of which the CAS is the reference. Judge Allen  thus  concluded
    that the Secretary of State made a lawful refusal of  the  application,
    subject to the issue of the  exercise  of  discretion  under  paragraph
    322(3). On the facts of that case, Judge Allen concluded that this  had
    not been done, and that there had been a failure by  the  Secretary  of
    State to appreciate that, having properly considered that the appellant
    was in breach of condition, she had a discretion to exercise but failed
    to exercise it. For the reasons set out  below,  I  reach  a  different
    conclusion on that issue on the facts of the appeal before me.

16. In Afzaal R (on the application of) v SSHD [2014]  EWHC  2215  (Admin),
    the High Court in Judicial Review  Proceedings  considered  the  issues
    raised there that there was no valid condition imposed on the leave  to
    enter so as to prevent study at a different institution, and  that  the
    Secretary of State had failed to exercise her discretion when  refusing
    the application. Paragraph 245ZW sets out that entry clearance will  be
    granted subject to a series of listed conditions, one of  which  is  in
    effect a restriction on study other than at the  institution  named  in
    the CAS. The court concluded that the  vignette  included  a  condition
    restricting study to the particular sponsor listed in the CAS and  thus
    the appellant was in breach of condition. The court, as did Judge Dean,
    also pointed out the requirement to make a fresh application is set out
    in the Tier 4 Guidance.

17. In Afzaal, the court rejected the argument that the decision was unfair
    because the breach was not brought to the attention  of  the  appellant
    before concluding to refuse the application. The court found  that  the
    requirements were clearly set out in both the rules and  the  guidance.
    The court found it wholly unsurprising that where clearance is  granted
    to an applicant to study at a particular college for a specific  period
    of time,  that  clearance  does  not  permit  the  applicant  to  study
    elsewhere, or not to study at all. The  court  found  nothing  in  that
    ground of appeal.

18. In Afzaal, the final ground of appeal was that the refusal decision did
    not expressly refer  to  the  exercise  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    discretion whether or not  to  refuse  further  leave  to  remain.  The
    guidance makes it clear that discretion should be considered  in  every
    case. "In my judgement in the present case, there is nothing to suggest
    that a discretion was not considered. The absence of specific reference
    in the decision letter is consistent with the fact that no grounds were
    advanced in support of  a  grant  of  further  leave  as  a  matter  of
    discretion. In my judgement, accordingly, there is nothing  to  support
    this ground of challenge which accordingly fails." The application  for
    judicial review was refused.

19. The vignette for the appellant in the present appeal  also  contains  a
    reference number of the CAS. It follows  that  there  was  a  condition
    prohibiting study elsewhere than the sponsor issuing the CAS  on  which
    entry clearance was granted. It is obvious that the  appellant  was  in
    breach of condition by studying with a  different  sponsor.  He  should
    have made a fresh application. He did  not  do  so.  There  is  nothing
    unfair about applying the clear rules, especially when  it  is  clearly
    explained in the Guidance.

20. Having read the refusal decision, whilst it makes  no  mention  of  the
    exercise of discretion in  refusing  the  application  under  paragraph
    322(3), it was in virtually identical terms  to  that  in  Afzaal.  The
    appellant had put forward no  particular  reason  why  his  application
    should  be  considered  exceptionally,  or  put  another  way  why  the
    Secretary of State should exercise discretion in his favour. He  cannot
    complain to have been taken by surprise that he was in  breach  of  his
    leave, merely on the basis that he claims to have been ignorant of  the
    requirement of the Rules  and  explained  in  the  Guidance.  There  is
    nothing to suggest  that  the  Secretary  of  State  did  not  exercise
    discretion. Indeed, it might well be considered that the discretion was
    exercised by refusing the application  instead  of  granting  it.  That
    appears to be consistent with the Guidance that  discretion  should  be
    considered in every case. If the Secretary of State had  set  out  that
    she had decided to exercise her  discretion  in  the  circumstances  to
    refuse the application, there would be no  difference  in  the  outcome
    just because of that wording. But a  moment's  thought  would  conclude
    that if the Secretary of State had properly exercised  her  discretion,
    there was no reason before her not to refuse the application, and every
    reason to do so, because the appellant was in breach of condition.  Put
    another way, nothing in the facts before the Secretary of  State  would
    have justified exercising the discretion to allow the appeal.

21. As did Judge Dean, one might well question whether LCBM was a competent
    sponsoring institution and must have known that a fresh application  is
    necessary and that they had not issued the appellant's  CAS  for  entry
    clearance. In the circumstances, there is no unfairness on the part  of
    the Secretary of State. If the appellant has a complaint, it is against
    LCBM and not the Secretary of State who cannot be held responsible  for
    the apparently incompetent advice given to the appellant. At �18  Judge
    Dean noted that there was no evidence from LCBM to confirm  the  advice
    given to the appellant.

22. I also note that in this case there were other reasons for  refusal  by
    the Secretary of State, set out in the letter of 6.11.13.


Conclusion & Decision:

23. Although the path may be somewhat different  to  that  taken  by  Judge
    Dean, I find that the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    did not involve the making of an error on a point of law such that  the
    decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
