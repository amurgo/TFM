For the Appellant:          Mr. S Sayeed, Counsel
For the Respondent:      Mr. G Jack, HOPO


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.      The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka, born on19 February 1989.
    He has been granted permission to appeal the determination of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Suchak dismissing his appeal against the refusal of
    the respondent to grant him asylum.

2.      The appellant was granted permission on two grounds:  the judge's
    treatment of the letter from the Sri Lankan lawyer and his treatment of
    the medical report on the appellant's scars.  Mr. Jack did not concede
    that the judge had erred in his findings on these issues.

3.      Mr. Jack however conceded that the judge's finding at paragraph 80
    that "these reports do not add anything to the appellant's claim" does
    not disclose any reasons as to why the psychiatric report adds nothing
    to the appellant's claim.  Mr. Sayeed agreed and added that this means
    that the judge's findings are vitiated by this error and the fact
    finding exercise needs to be re-visited.  Mr. Jack agreed that the lack
    of a proper analysis of the medical evidence has affected the judge's
    credibility findings.

4.      Accordingly, I remit this appeal to Taylor House for re-hearing by
    a Fist-tier Judge other than FtTJ Suchak.
