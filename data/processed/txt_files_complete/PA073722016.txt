               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                  HEWA AWAT
                       (Anonymity Direction Not Made)

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Mr J Bryce, Advocate, instructed by Maguire
Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The SHD appeals against a determination by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Kempton, allowing Mr  Awat's  appeal  his  appeal  against  refusal  of
    asylum.

 2. Mrs M O'Brien submitted on ground 1 that the judge failed  to  consider
    the alternative of relocation in Baghdad, and that  although  the  SSHD
    was not presented and so did not raise that issue at the  FtT  hearing,
    it arose from the terms of the decision, and so the judge was bound  to
    deal with it.

 3. It was (correctly) conceded that ground 2  is  only  a  narrative,  and
    discloses no issue of legal error.

 4. I indicated that the SSHD's appeal would be dismissed.

 5. The refusal decision, as pointed out in the  rule  24  response  by  Mr
    Bryce, deals only with relocation via Baghdad, not in  Baghdad.   There
    was no issue before the judge.

 6. Even if the issue had arisen, it is, generally  speaking,  rather  more
    difficult for someone in the category of Mr Awat to relocate to Baghdad
    than to the IKR; and the SSHD took no issue with  the  judge's  finding
    that he could not relocate to the IKR.

 7. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

 8. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
