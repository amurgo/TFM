                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  (SSHD)  appeals
         against the decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  B  Lloyd
         (the judge), promulgated on 10 August 2016, allowing the appeals of
         Mr Kalsi and Mrs  Sembhi  (hereafter  the  claimants)  against  the
         SSHD's decision dated  4  November  2015  refusing  to  issue  them
         residence cards pursuant  to  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
         Area) Regulations 2006.

      2. This appeal initially  came  before  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
         Macdonald on 19 April 2017. In a decision promulgated by the Deputy
         Judge on 4 May 2017 he concluded, in reliance on the Upper Tribunal
         decision of Sala [2016] UKUT 0411, that he had no  jurisdiction  to
         entertain the appeal. Sala was overturned by the Court of Appeal in
         Khan v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017]  EWCA  Civ
         1755. In a decision promulgated on 23 October 2018  Upper  Tribunal
         Judge Jackson satisfied herself that the  Deputy  Judge's  decision
         should be set aside pursuant to rule 43 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. The matter was listed for  hearing  to
         determine whether the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  disclosed  a
         legal error such as to require it to be set aside.

Factual Background

      3. The claimants, a husband  and  wife,  are  Indian  nationals.  They
         entered the UK on 8 March 2011, the wife with entry clearance as  a
         student, her husband as her  dependent.  Although  they  were  both
         granted further leave  this  was  later  curtailed  and  subsequent
         applications for further leave to remain in the same capacity  were
         refused. The claimants made a human rights  claim  based  on  their
         private and family life on 8 December 2014 but this was  made  void
         on 22 June 2015. On 19 May 2015 they  both  applied  for  residence
         cards as  the  extended  family  members  of  the  1st  appellant's
         brother, Sarbjit Singh, a German national  (sponsor).  The  sponsor
         entered the UK on 16 January 2015.

      4. The SSHD  did  not  accept  that  the  claimants  had  been  either
         financially dependent or a part of  the  sponsor's  household  when
         they lived in India or when they entered the  UK  until  they  were
         joined by the sponsor in January 2015.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

      5. At [7] of his decision the judge stated, "the principal  issue  for
         this  appeal  has  been  whether  the  [claimants]  have   provided
         sufficient evidence to discharge their burden of proof to show that
         they are extended family members as claimed;  and  that  they  have
         been and continue to be dependent upon the Sponsor."  At  [11]  the
         judge stated, "the principal issue is one  of  credibility  of  the
         [claimants], their Sponsor and the application as a whole."

      6. At [13] to [22] the judge set out the evidence from the  claimants,
         the sponsor and from Balbir Singh,  the  1st  appellant's  maternal
         uncle. The judge additionally indicated that he took  into  account
         the supporting documents in the bundles provided by the parties. In
         setting out the evidence it appears that the  judge,  at  the  same
         time, recorded the submissions made by  the  parties.  It  was  the
         SSHD's case that the applications were contrived purely  to  secure
         the right of residence, and that there was insufficient evidence to
         demonstrate previous financial dependency when the claimants  lived
         in India.

      7. After accurately setting out the relevant provisions  of  the  2006
         Regulations the judge sets out his 'Findings and Conclusions.'  The
         judge found that, while there was "... a degree of ambiguity in the
         evidence presented to this appeal", and while  accepting  that,  on
         one  level,  the  SSHD's  assertions  were  logical,   the   SSHD's
         submissions were nevertheless unsustainable on the evidence and his
         concerns were essentially speculative (at [26]).

      8. At [28] the judge stated,

             "Having regard to the totality of the evidence, I  believe  on
             the  balance  of  probabilities  that  Mr  Sarbjit  Singh  had
             provided funds for the [1st  claimant's]  education  in  India
             from the time of his emigration to Germany in  1999.  Further,
             however overly philanthropic it may seem,  I  accept  that  he
             probably did finance the [2nd claimant's]  wish  to  study  in
             London. The [claimants] were making the best of an opportunity
             provided to them. I do not consider that it was necessarily  a
             contrived plan to remain in the United Kingdom indefinitely."

      9. Having then found that the claimants and the sponsor established  a
         joint household in the UK from the beginning of 2015, the judge was
         satisfied that the claimants were, at all material times, dependent
         upon the sponsor and that  they  met  the  definition  of  extended
         family members in Reg 8(2) of the 2006 Regulations.

The grounds of appeal and the error of law hearing

     10. The grounds essentially contend  that  the  judge  failed  to  give
         adequate reasons for his findings. In particular,  while  referring
         to the presence of 'ambiguity' in the evidence, the judge failed to
         give adequate reasons for believing that  the  sponsor  funded  the
         claimants' education in both India and the UK. There was said to be
         a failure to engage in a rigorous examination of the  evidence.  It
         was additionally contended that the judge was not entitled to allow
         the appeal outright.

     11. Mr Kandola expanded upon the grounds, focusing on the inadequacy of
         the judge's reasons for finding the  claimants'  account  credible,
         for failing to identify  the  particular  evidence  upon  which  he
         relied for his findings, and  for  allowing  the  appeals  outright
         without remitting it to the Secretary of State  to  enable  him  to
         exercise his discretion.

     12. Mr Richardson accepted that the Judge had  erred  in  allowing  the
         appeals outright without remitting the  applications  back  to  the
         respondent to enable him to exercise his discretion. Mr  Richardson
         nevertheless invited me to consider the decision  holistically  and
         with reference to the evidence previously identified by the  judge.
         I was referred to, in particular,  the  judge's  recording  of  the
         evidence of the payments made  by  the  sponsor  to  the  claimants
         following their entry to the UK,  and  to  the  evidence  of  money
         remitted to the general family in India contained at  pages  84  to
         111 the claimant's bundle.

     13. Having carefully considered the evidence available  to  the  judge,
         and the reasoning  given  by  the  judge  for  his  conclusions,  I
         indicated to the parties that I was satisfied the judge  materially
         erred in law, both by failing  to  give  adequate  reasons  and  by
         allowing the appeal outright.  By  agreement  with  the  parties  I
         indicated that I would remit the  matter  back  to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal for a fresh hearing.

Discussion

     14. It is a trite proposition of law  that  a  Tribunal  must  disclose
         clearly the reasons for its decision (see, for example, MK (duty to
         give reasons) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 00641 (IAC)). The reasons do not
         necessarily need  to  be  detailed  or  extensive,  but  they  must
         adequately explain to both parties why a particular conclusion  was
         reached. The adequacy of any reasons provided must also be assessed
         by reference to the particular issues raised in an  appeal  and  by
         reference to  the  specific  concerns  identified  by  the  initial
         decision maker.

     15. Although the judge properly indicated that the principal issue  was
         one of credibility of the claimants and their  sponsor,  the  judge
         failed to provide adequate reasons for finding  the  claimants  and
         the sponsor credible. At [28] the judge found that the sponsor  had
         provided funds for the 1st claimant's education in India  from  the
         time of his emigration to Germany  in  1999,  but  the  judge  only
         supported this conclusion by reference to his "having regard to the
         totality of  the  evidence."  The  judge  does  not  identify  what
         particular evidence  supported  his  conclusion.  While  there  was
         evidence of the remittal of money by the sponsor to his  family  in
         India, this was to the family unit  as  a  whole  and  without  any
         particular reference to either of the claimants. The judge does not
         explain why  he  was  apparently  satisfied  with  the  explanation
         proffered by the claimants. While the  judge  does  offer  slightly
         more explanation for concluding that the sponsor  did  finance  the
         2nd claimant's studies in the UK, he once again fails  to  identify
         what particular aspects of the evidence before  him  persuaded  him
         that this was the case. One is left wondering why the judge reached
         the conclusions he did. While the judge may  have  ultimately  been
         entitled to reach his conclusions, his decision does  not  disclose
         that it was reached by a lawful path.

     16. Nor am I satisfied that the judge has given  adequate  reasons  for
         finding that  the  claimants  were  financially  dependent  on  the
         sponsor from their entry in 2011 until  they  were  joined  by  the
         sponsor in January 2015. The judge fails to identify  the  evidence
         upon which he relies in support of this conclusion in  the  section
         of his decision headed 'Findings and Conclusions'.  Although  there
         appears to have been oral evidence,  recorded  at  [14],  that  the
         sponsor made a payment of �5000 to the claimants in respect of  the
         2nd claimant's course fees, and a sum of �2000 was  allegedly  made
         available for their living expenses when they arrived in the UK, it
         is not apparent that there was any documentary evidence  supporting
         these assertions. The judge additionally recorded,  at  [18],  that
         the 1st  appellant's  maternal  uncle  often  acted  as  a  courier
         transferring  money  to  the  claimants,  but,  once  again,  these
         assertions were without  documentary  support,  and  there  was  no
         explanation  why  the  maternal  uncle  would  visit  the   UK   so
         frequently.  The judge does not, in any event,  adequately  explain
         why he believed these assertions were true. Although the judge  may
         have been entitled to accept the oral evidence from  the  claimants
         and their witnesses, in circumstances where their  credibility  had
         been clearly rejected by the SSHD, and in the absence of supportive
         documentary evidence, he had to explain, in  coherent  and  logical
         terms, why he found their account credible. He failed to do so. I'm
         consequently satisfied the decision contains an error on a point of
         law sufficient to require it to be set aside.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material legal  errors  and
is set aside.
