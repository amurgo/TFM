Representation:
For the Appellant:      Ms J Kelly, Counsel instructed by Lawrence Lupin
Solicitors
For the Respondent:     Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 we make an order prohibiting the disclosure or publication of  any
    matter likely to lead members of the public to identify the  appellant.
    Breach of this order can be punished as a contempt of court. Mindful of
    the legitimate public interest in deportation cases we  have  hesitated
    before making this order but claims for  international  protection  are
    usually best kept private if for no other reason than  eliminating  the
    irony of a person becoming a refugee  solely  by  reason  of  his  case
    attracting publicity.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of C�te d'Ivoire who was born on 1987 and so
    is now 27 years old.  He appealed a decision of the  respondent  on  25
    November 2013 that section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 applies  to
    his circumstances.  He  claimed  that  he  should  not  be  subject  to
    automatic deportation.  He said that  he  is  a  refugee  or  otherwise
    entitled to international protection and that removing him would breach
    the United Kingdom's obligations under the European Convention on Human
    Rights, particularly with regard to Article 8.

 3. His appeal was dismissed on all grounds by the First-tier Tribunal in a
    determination promulgated on 4 June 2014.  The judge giving  permission
    to appeal expressly  refused  permission  to  appeal  the  decision  to
    dismiss the  appeal  with  reference  to  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights but found it arguable  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had given insufficient reasons for rejecting the  evidence  of
    Professor  Aguilar  who  said   that   the   appellant   still   needed
    international protection. Permission to appeal was also  given  because
    it was arguable that the Tribunal was  wrong  in  concluding  that  the
    appellant was excluded from the protection of the Refugee Convention by
    reason of section 72 of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002.  It was his case that his circumstances did not come  within  the
    terms of the section.

 4. The papers show that the appellant entered the  United  Kingdom  on  30
    March 2001 with permission with a  view  to  settlement.  He  was  then
    almost 14 years old.

 5. The appellant has frequently behaved badly.  Between May 2004 and  June
    2006 he was convicted on five  occasions  for  offences  including  the
    possession of prescribed drugs and robbery.  His sentences included  90
    days' detention at a young offenders  institute  in  October  2005  and
    twelve months' detention at a young  offenders  institute  in  December
    2005 for robbery.  In 2007 he was  cautioned  for  beating  his  former
    partner.

 6. On 8 August 2008 at  the  Crown  Court  sitting  at  Sheffield  he  was
    sentenced to a total of four and a  half  years  imprisonment.  He  was
    sentenced to two concurrent terms of two years for possessing  class  A
    controlled drugs with intent to supply and to consecutive terms of  two
    and a half years  for  similar  offences.  He  was  also  sentenced  to
    concurrent terms for possessing cannabis and possessing a lock knife.

 7. In November 2008 he was notified of his alleged liability to  automatic
    deportation and a deportation order was served in July 2009.  He made a
    belated  attempt  to   appeal   that   decision   and   then   applied,
    unsuccessfully, for it to be  revoked.   He  appealed  the  refusal  to
    revoke. The appeal was heard on  10  February  2012  and  allowed  with
    reference to Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The
    tribunal was satisfied that there was a  real  risk  of  the  appellant
    being ill-treated because he is a member of the  B�t�  tribe.   He  was
    found not to be entitled to asylum because of the provisions of section
    72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 8. For convenience I describe the First-tier  Tribunal  that  decided  the
    appeal in 2012 as the "first tribunal" and its  determination  allowing
    the appeal after the hearing in February as the "first determination".

 9. The appellant continued to misbehave.  He was involved in further drugs
    offences. On 19 September 2012 he was convicted with five others at the
    Crown Court sitting at Woolwich on four counts  of  supplying  class  A
    drugs.  He was sentenced on 19 February  2013  to  a  total  of  twenty
    months' imprisonment.  It  was  that  sentence  of  imprisonment  which
    prompted his being served with a notice of liability to deportation  to
    which he responded with a claim for asylum.  It was  the  Secretary  of
    State's position that the appellant had to be made  the  subject  of  a
    deportation order by reason of his being sentenced to more than  twelve
    months' imprisonment unless one of the exceptions under section  33  of
    the UK Borders Act 2007 applied which, in her view, they did not.

10. The Secretary of State did not accept that the appellant was a  refugee
    for two reasons.  Firstly she did not accept that the appellant  needed
    protection.  Although it had been established that  there  was  a  time
    when members of the B�t� tribe, or some of them, would be  at  risk  in
    the event of their return to C�te d'Ivoire  it  was  the  Secretary  of
    State's contention that those days were over and  the  appellant  could
    now return safely to the country of which he is a national.

11. It was the Secretary of State's further  contention  that  if  she  was
    wrong about the appellant not needing protection he was not entitled to
    refugee status and was  not  entitled  to  humanitarian  protection  by
    reason of his bad behaviour.

12. His appeal was dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal in a  determination
    promulgated  on  4  June  2014.  We  describe  that  as   the   "second
    determination" and the division of the tribunal that decided is at  the
    "second tribunal". It is the appeal against  the  second  determination
    that is before us.

13. The second tribunal did not accept that the appellant would be at  risk
    in the event of his return.

14. It began, appropriately, by  considering  the  findings  of  the  first
    tribunal. The first tribunal had discounted  the  contention  that  the
    appellant would be suspected of  witchcraft  and  the  second  tribunal
    found no reason to go behind that decision.   The  first  tribunal  was
    satisfied that the appellant was at risk because of his B�t� ethnicity.
     That view was supported by expert evidence  but  the  second  tribunal
    found that country conditions had changed  since  February  2012.   The
    second tribunal noted that following  President  Gbagbo's  attempts  to
    remain in power after he lost the presidential elections 2010  violence
    was targeted against people of B�t� ethnicity because they were assumed
    to be supporters of the former president.

15. The first tribunal had an expert from Professor Mario I  Aguilar  dated
    25 January 2012. It was his view then that the appellant was  at  risk.
    Apart  from  his  ethnicity  the  appellant  would  attract  additional
    suspicion by reason of his coming from abroad.

16. In his supplementary report of 21 May 2014 Professor Aguilar said  that
    it remained his view that the appellant was as at risk.

17. The second tribunal did not agree.  It looked at the Human Rights Watch
    Report of January 2014 showing  how  in  2013  progress  was  made  and
    security force abuses decreased from the previous year.  Although there
    were still numerous human  rights  violations  the  peace  process  was
    ongoing.  The country's security situation had improved  although  land
    conflicts simmered in the Western part  of  the  country.   Disarmament
    proceeded slowly and land rights were still violated.

18. The Amnesty International Report of 20 May 2013 confirmed  that  ethnic
    B�t�s and Gu�r�s were assumed to be supporters of the former  president
    and were targeted as a consequence.  However, most attacks were in  the
    West of  the  country  where  Dozos  were  reported  to  be  preventing
    internally displaced people from accessing their land or were  imposing
    arbitrary payments.

19. The second tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant  would  be  at
    risk just by reason of his being B�t�.  He would  not  be  involved  in
    land disputes because he had no land.

20. The second tribunal explained that it did not accept that the appellant
    had lost contact with his family in C�te d'Ivoire.  Certainly  in  2012
    the appellant's father  (who  lives  in  the  United  Kingdom)  made  a
    statement saying that he had contact with his brother, the  appellant's
    uncle, in C�te d'Ivoire. In the absence of any  persuasive  explanation
    to support a contrary conclusion the second  tribunal  did  not  accept
    that the appellant had lost the means to contact his uncle in 2014.

21. The second tribunal  found  that  the  appellant  could  reasonably  be
    expected to be reunited with his aunt although the Tribunal did  accept
    that  he  had  lost   contact   because   of   failure   in   telephone
    communications.  The Tribunal did not accept the appellant risked being
    trafficked or facing forced conscription because he  had  relatives  in
    C�te d'Ivoire who could help him.

22. It was the appellant's case that he had left C�te d'Ivoire when he  was
    aged about 14. The Tribunal did not accept that he would face any  risk
    of  being  thought  to   have   been   involved   with   the   previous
    administration.

23. We begin by considering the challenge to  these  findings  because  the
    appellant's need for international protection, if any, impacts  on  the
    whole approach to determining this appeal.

24. We have read Professor Aguilar's supplementary report of  21  May  2014
    and, like the  First-tier  Tribunal,  struggle  to  understand  how  he
    reaches the conclusion that he does.  Certainly there are reports  that
    there have been attacks on refugees  and  that  prison  conditions  for
    those  awaiting  trial  give  cause  for  concern.   Professor  Aguilar
    speculated that things would get worse in the run up  to  the  election
    but they are not due until 2015.

25. The report also explained helpfully the nature of  the  "Dozo".   These
    are described as:

         "an ancient brotherhood of traditional hunters found mainly in C�te
         d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali and Sierra Leone.  Ordinarily,
         members carry small calibre hunting rifles and  are  bedecked  with
         amulets said to render them invincible.  They are also believed  to
         have mystical powers."

26. Clearly  the  Dozo  are  an  identifiable  group  who  are  accused  of
    racketeering.  We cannot see anything that shows  their  behaviour,  or
    behaviour attributed to them, creates a real risk for  this  appellant.
    A dangerous encounter with them is a possibility but no more.

27. Nevertheless at paragraph 15 Professor Aguilar said:

         "It is still my expert opinion that if returned to the Ivory  Coast
         R- Z- would be at risk of arrest and interrogation by  the  Ivorian
         Army and the Ivorian Police, particularly as he is  returning  from
         abroad and because of the past persecution of his ethnic  group  by
         the current Ivorian government.  The risks faced by Mr Z- arise out
         of his ethnicity that of the  previous  president,  and  a  general
         financial and social  vulnerability  as  outlined  in  my  previous
         report at paragraph 30, i.e. forced conscription, forced labour and
         possible human trafficking.  The reasons  I  gave  in  my  previous
         report for risk to his life remain in place in 2014 Ivory Coast."

28. The first tribunal's reasons for allowing the appeal in 2012 are summed
    up at paragraph 33 of its determination.  The Tribunal said:

         "There seems to be no dispute in this case that this appellant is a
         member of the B�t� tribe.  His father gave evidence to that  effect
         and indeed, so  it  appears,  his  father  is  well  aware  of  the
         political situation in the Ivory Coast.  He even knew the date that
         the former president faces trial in the War Crimes  Tribunal.   The
         appellant's father notes that his son would be readily  discernible
         as a member of the B�t� merely by his surname.  However, we have to
         look at the evidence of Professor Aguilar.  He speaks of members of
         the B�t�  tribe  being  in  a  position  of  political  and  social
         vulnerability and were  currently  targeted  for  revenge  killings
         because of their ethnicity and allegiance to the former  president.
         However, more significantly, he concludes that this appellant would
         be subject to a number of extra risk factors including suspicion by
         the authorities and other people due to his  having  lived  abroad,
         his financial and social vulnerability, his lack of family and  his
         age and that he was at a very  high  risk  of  being  arrested  and
         killed by the authorities or the anti-B�t� guerrilla  groups  still
         roaming the country".

29. This is plainly a  finding  based  very  closely  on  paragraph  30  of
    Professor Aguilar's report prepared for  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    which paragraph Professor Aguilar says stands in 2014.

30. In reaching its decision in 2012 the first tribunal made it plain  that
    it hoped that any problems for the B�t� tribe in the Ivory Coast  would
    be short-lived.

31. Whilst Professor Aguilar  has  repeated  his  earlier  opinion  we  see
    nothing in the supplementary report that supports its  contention  that
    B�t� people generally are at risk now.  The  second  tribunal  in  2014
    recognised that some B�t� people were at risk but this appellant is not
    in detention and was not politically involved in the days  of  the  old
    regime and is not involved in land disputes. Professor Aguilar did  not
    produce any evidence to suggest that members of the B�t� tribe  are  at
    risk per se.

32. The Tribunal expressly recognised evidence in the Amnesty International
    Report of 2013 that:

         "members of ethnic groups (including B�t�s  and  Gu�r�s)  who  were
         generally accused of being supporters of  former  President  Gbagbo
         were targeted on ethnic grounds, notably in the West of the country
         where Dozos reportedly  prevented  returning  internally  displaced
         people from accessing their land or imposed arbitrary payments."

33. The appellant's father's evidence was that his family  originally  came
    from the West of the country and  there  may  be  difficulties  if  the
    appellant had to return to the West of the country but we see no reason
    why he would be required to  do  that.   On  the  contrary  the  second
    tribunal assumed that he would be able to establish himself in  a  part
    of the country where his experience of life in the United  Kingdom  and
    undoubted linguistic skills would be an advantage.

34. We do not accept  that  there  is  any  error  of  law  in  the  second
    tribunal's approach to assessing the risk facing the appellant  in  the
    event of his return now.

35. It began, correctly, with the findings of the first tribunal and looked
    carefully at the evidence before it.  It understood Professor Aguilar's
    opinion but looked at the evidence behind it and found  that  any  real
    risk to ethnic B�t�s now appears to be to those already in  custody  or
    possibly those seeking to return to their traditional homelands and re-
    establish themselves.  The first tribunal's decision in 2012  was  made
    at a time of extreme hostility towards B�t�s  and  the  first  tribunal
    acting responsibly and cautiously, properly applying the  low  standard
    of proof.

36. We particularly note  paragraph  64  of  the  determination  where  the
    Tribunal found that the appellant had lived in Abidjan before  removing
    to the United Kingdom.  That it is in the South East of the country. It
    is ethnically  varied  and  is  somewhere  where  the  appellant  could
    reasonably be expected to return if he did not risk going to the  B�t�-
    dominated area where some troubles remain.

37. We are quite satisfied that the second tribunal in 2014  was  aware  of
    the previous decisions and  handled  them  correctly  in  law  but  was
    entitled to conclude as it did that the risk identified then  does  not
    exist now.

38. Given that finding, arguments based on what kind of protection  if  any
    he would have been  given  in  the  event  of  his  being  entitled  to
    protection become somewhat sterile.  Nevertheless they have been raised
    and we must deal with them.

39. We find no error here.  It is the appellant's contention that he is not
    excluded from the protection of  the  Refugee  Convention  because  the
    offence with which he was most recently convicted did not  attract  two
    years' imprisonment.  It must be remembered that this section 72(2)  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 creates a presumption.
     It does not establish a fact.  Clearly there will be many cases  where
    the passage of time will make it very easy  to  rebut  the  presumption
    that a person who has been convicted of a  particularly  serious  crime
    constitutes a danger to the community but we see nothing  objectionable
    or inconsistent with the plain meaning of the section in deciding  that
    once a person has been convicted and sentenced to more than two  years'
    imprisonment the presumption that that person has been convicted  of  a
    particularly serious crime and constitutes a danger to the community of
    the United Kingdom stands for all  time.  Convictions  that  are  spent
    might require particular consideration but that is a point  to  address
    if and when it arises.

40. We are unconcerned that the  second  tribunal  did  not  show  that  it
    distinguished between the  two  presumptions  created  by  section  72.
    Clearly there are two presumptions but this is a case where  the  first
    tribunal in 2012 found, and it appeared to have been accepted, that the
    appellant had been convicted of a particularly serious crime.   Nothing
    turns  on  this  apparent  failure  to  recognise  the  need  for   two
    presumptions.

41. We have found it difficult to  follow  the  appellant's  argument  that
    Article  14  of  the  Qualification  Directive  somehow  restricts  the
    application of section 72 of the 2002 Act.   Article  14(4)(b)  permits
    the refusal of refugee status when a person, "having been convicted  by
    a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a  danger
    to the community of that Member State."

42.  We  agree  that  this  means  that  for  "danger"  to  be  a  relevant
    consideration it must exist at the time that the decision is made.   We
    do not agree that this article  eliminates  a  presumption  created  by
    section 72.  As indicated above, the presumption may be  made  easy  to
    rebut by the passage of time or will be rebutted by  the  operation  of
    the principles set out in Devaseelan [2002] UKIAT 00702; [2003] Imm  AR
    1 but the presumption of law continues to apply.

43. We note that at paragraph 33 of its determination the  second  tribunal
    indicated that if (in fact it made no such finding) the:

         "previous  panel  found  that  the  appellant  had   rebutted   the
         presumption then a further conviction where the  sentence  was  for
         less than two years would not resurrect the presumption".

44. We do not agree.  Whilst it is probably the case that a finding that  a
    person had not been convicted of a  particularly  serious  crime  would
    stand, a finding that a person was not a danger to the community is one
    that could  be  illuminated  by  subsequent  events  including  further
    criminal activity that attracted less  than  2  years  imprisonment  as
    punishment.

45. We do not agree with the criticism in ground 3 that the Tribunal  erred
    in its appreciation of the OASys Report.  It is plainly right that  the
    report did not say in terms that the appellant  constituted  a  "medium
    risk of serious harm to the public".  The report undoubtedly  concluded
    that the appellant presented a medium risk of reoffending.  The  phrase
    "medium risk" can be found at page 60 and 66 of the bundle in the OASys
    Report.  Page 70  of  the  report  gives  the  predictor  scores  as  a
    percentage and identifies as risk category. There was a 31%  chance  of
    reoffending in the first year and 48% in the second year. Overall there
    is a low probability of further re-offending but a  medium  probability
    of any further offending being violent and a like chance  of  it  being
    non-violent.

46. These phrases, despite their use of numbers,  cannot  be  an  actuarial
    assessment because the necessary data, as far as we are aware,  is  not
    available.  The second tribunal's conclusion that the appellant had not
    rebutted the statutory presumption takes account  of  all  the  factors
    listed under the heading of "findings" from paragraph 32  to  paragraph
    39.  The  second  tribunal  was  clearly  concerned  by  the  appellant
    committing two  offences  in  June  2012  which  attracted  the  prison
    sentences that led to these proceedings.  The second tribunal did  have
    regard to the fact that the appellant had undertaken  courses  in  drug
    misuse and had been drug-free for a time.  We see nothing irrational in
    the second tribunal going on to say that the  appellant  had  not  done
    enough to rebut the presumption created by the convictions in 2004.

47. There is some laxity of  expression  in  paragraph  38  of  the  second
    tribunal's determination  where  the  second  tribunal  refers  to  the
    appellant being "at medium risk of serious harm to the public"  and  Ms
    Kelly, as she is perfectly entitled to do, seized upon it. We  find  on
    reflection that this phrase, read in context, is not a  material  error
    of law. The second tribunal did not find that the appellant had  failed
    to rebut the presumption of law that he was a danger to  the  community
    because it misread the OASys  report  but  because  the  appellant  was
    convicted of supplying class A drugs in 2012.

48. In any event the second tribunal's decision that the appellant was  not
    a refugee cannot be materially wrong as the second tribunal found  that
    he did not need protection.

49. The Tribunal was clearly aware of the warnings in Maslov v Austria App
    no.1683/03 [2008] ECHR 546, about the need  for  "serious  reasons"  to
    justify the expulsion of a person who had spent the major part  of  his
    childhood and youth in the host country.  The fact is  the  appellant's
    time in the United Kingdom has been very unhappy.  He started offending
    within two years of arriving and of the thirteen years he had spent  in
    the United Kingdom a considerable portion  of  it  has  been  spent  in
    prison. The second tribunal thought it as much as half of the time.  We
    are not sure that is right but the suggestion was not criticised before
    us. Certainly the appellant was not able to rely on any of  the  strong
    elements in a private and family life which occasionally,  usually  for
    the sake of people other than the person to  be  removed,  can  make  a
    difference.

50. This is a sad story of a young man who has been involved in  a  variety
    of serious criminal acts which has resulted in his  spending  prolonged
    periods of his life in custody.  He has not established strong links in
    the United Kingdom and has continued to offend.  Points have been  made
    properly on his behalf.  He has made  efforts  to  get  away  from  his
    addition to drugs which  addiction  has  clearly  caused  him  so  much
    trouble but the fact remains that he is a foreign criminal  within  the
    meaning of the Act who is eligible for deportation.

51. The second tribunal has decided  rationally  although  he  would  quite
    recently have risked persecution because of his tribal origin that risk
    has subsided and he can not be returned safely.

52. That decision is sufficient  to  dispose  of  the  appeal  and  we  are
    satisfied that it is a decision  reached  for  lawful  reasons  in  the
    determination before us.

53. We make it plain that the Tribunal was entitled to  conclude  that  the
    appellant is not  a  refugee  because  he  is  disentitled  to  refugee
    protection by reason of his behaviour and  he  has  not  dislodged  the
    presumption of law which says that he has committed  a  really  serious
    criminal offence and is a danger to the community.  Save for a slightly
    unfortunate phrase in dealing with the OASys evidence  we  see  nothing
    objectionable in this determination and the error identified  when  set
    in context was not material.

54. It follows therefore that we find there is  no  error  of  law  and  we
    dismiss the appellant's appeal.
