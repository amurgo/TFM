                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision allowing the claimant's appeal against refusal by the
    Entry Clearance Officer in Islamabad of entry clearance for her to join
    her husband in the United Kingdom as a  partner,  under  paragraph  EC-
    P.1.1. of Appendix FM.   The  claimant's  husband  appeared  in  person
    before us today and brought with him documents which  were  not  before
    the Entry Clearance Officer, which tend to show that he earns far  more
    than is necessary to meet the requirements of the Rules.  It is  common
    ground that the documents were not before the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    when the decision was made.

The new documents

 2. The documents produced to the Entry Clearance Officer were copies,  not
    original documents.  They were:

          . a P60 end of year certificate showing that the sponsor paid tax
            on income of �30,000 in the tax year to the end  of  5th  April
            2016;

          . two letters from Fitness Junction Limited confirming salary  of
            �30,000,

          . a set of payslips showing payment of his salary of �30000.  The
            tax appears to have been paid  separately  to  HM  Revenue  and
            Customs because it does not show as deducted on  the  payslips.



          . a letter from HM Revenue and Customs confirming  that  for  the
            tax year 2013/14 he paid tax on �30,000.

First-tier Tribunal's decision

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer in Islamabad refused entry clearance to the
    claimant on the basis  that  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  at
    paragraph 2 were not met.  The First-tier Judge said this

         "10. I conclude that whilst he acknowledges he  cannot  demonstrate
             that by the production  of  bank  statements  he  did  provide
             information from the company's own accountant specifying  what
             his  wages  were  that  they  were  paid  and  information  to
             demonstrate that he had paid tax on those earnings during  the
             relevant period.  I find that he  not  only  has  demonstrated
             that he had the income required well in excess of �18,600  but
             that he has demonstrated that he continues to do so on the up-
             to-date evidence supplied  relevant  to  the  issue  of  entry
             clearance now.

         11.  Were it the case that he could not 'strictly' comply with  the
             requirements of the Rules as the actual  evidence  supplied  I
             would conclude that in these circumstances he having  provided
             entirely reliable evidence from the Revenue as to his earnings
             over the period and a letter from his accountant to  the  same
             effect supplied to  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  that  this
             appeal should be allowed under Article 8.

         12.  The issue under the Immigration Rules is whether he can supply
             evidence that there are funds in accordance  with  the  Rules.
             Whilst he could not supply and would not even now be  able  to
             remedy it by providing late  bank  statements  to  show  those
             payments because he received everything in cash as was  stated
             by the accountants and his employers and as  is  reflected  in
             his bank statements he was able to supply since  the  evidence
             of the payment to the Revenue of tax on his  income  from  the
             same employer  as  demonstrated  in  the  pages  noted  above.
             Accordingly, he has met the requirement of the Rules as to his
             income.  That was the only issue raised I  conclude  therefore
             that the appeal must be allowed."



Permission to appeal

 4. The basis of the Secretary  of  State's  appeal  is,  first,  that  the
    sponsor is not exempt from the financial requirements of the Rules, and
    the First-tier Tribunal misdirected itself in relying on wages received
    in cash; and second, that no compelling circumstances engaging  Article
    8 ECHR were found and that Article 8 had been misapplied.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Pooler on the basis,  so  far
    as relevant, that

         "The only issue under the Rules was whether the claimant had  shown
         that her sponsor had earnings in excess of  the  income  threshold.
         The judge found that the requirements of the  Rules  were  met  and
         alternatively that the appeal should be allowed under Article 8.

         4.   The grounds refer to the specified evidence to be provided  in
             respect of income received in cash the judge  who  found  that
             the sponsor could not evidence his income by reference to bank
             statements arguably misdirected herself as to the requirements
             of the Rules.

         5.   It is also arguable that  the  judge  misdirected  herself  in
             relation to Article 8 by failing  to  find  the  existence  of
             compelling  circumstances  using  Article  8  as   a   general
             dispensing power and failing to make a finding as  to  whether
             the parties could enjoy family life elsewhere."

Discussion

 6. On a proper reading of the decision the Article  8  point  falls  away.
    The judge very clearly made her decision only within the Rules and  the
    glancing reference to Article 8 is not operative  in  her  decision  to
    allow the appeal.  We need concern ourselves no further with Article 8.



 7. We note that the sponsor has done everything he can  to  show  that  he
    does have the income in question: he has stopped receiving his  pay  in
    cash, and he told us that it now all goes  through  his  bank  account,
    ever since he discovered the necessity of it at the  previous  hearing.
    There should therefore now be no difficulty, if circumstances have  not
    changed, for him to meet the requirements of paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-
    SE.

 8. For the respondent,  Mr  Wilding  stated  that  on  the  basis  of  the
    documents now produced, if the application were to be  made  today  and
    there were no further complications, it would be a very straightforward
    application.

 9. As far as the issue under  the  Immigration  Rules  is  concerned,  the
    sponsor acknowledged before the First-tier Tribunal that he  could  not
    meet the specified document requirements at the  date  of  application,
    the date of  decision,  or  the  date  of  hearing  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  In those circumstances the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  erred
    in law in accepting alternative evidence at the hearing.

10. The sponsor is extremely keen to have his wife join him in  the  United
    Kingdom: the best course is for him to make another application as soon
    as possible and this time ensure that the requirements of the Rules are
    met.

Decision

The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed.  There is a  material  error  of
law in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision.   We  substitute  a  decision
dismissing the claimant's appeal.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made no order pursuant to Rule 13  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules
2014.  We have not been asked to make any anonymity order under Rule  14  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and we  do  not  consider
that there is any necessity to do so.
