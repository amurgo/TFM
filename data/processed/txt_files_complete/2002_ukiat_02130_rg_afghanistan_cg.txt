                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department

                                                                  RESPONDENT




                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



  1. The Appellant, a citizen of Afghanistan, appeals, with leave,  against
     the determination of an Adjudicator,  Mr  A  W  Khan,  dismissing  his
     appeal against the decision  of  the  Respondent  on  3rd  March  2000
     refusing him leave to enter having refused  asylum.   Before  us,  the
     Appellant is represented by Ms Gill, instructed by Gupta  &  Partners,
     and the Respondent is represented by Mr Blundell.

  2. As his name suggests, the Appellant is a  Sikh.   He  claims  a  well-
     founded fear of persecution on the basis that, as a  Sikh,  he  is  at
     risk from the present situation  in  Afghanistan  under  a  government
     which, in Ms Gill's submission, is, at any rate partly, in the control
     of the Mujahideen.  The evidence  suggesting  that,  as  a  Sikh,  the
     Appellant is at risk is confined to material derived from  reports  of
     the early 1990s when the Mujahideen were in control in Afghanistan  as
     the government of that country.

  3. In three passages from Amnesty International Reports, which have  been
     put before us in a somewhat defective form, there are  indications  of
     occasional attacks on both Hindu and Sikh houses  in  Afghanistan  and
     there is a clear indication in the 1994 Amnesty  International  Report
     that "almost all Sikh and Hindu families" have  left  Afghanistan  for
     Pakistan and some have  moved  on  to  India.   The  source  of  their
     difficulties is the subject of a hint in the 1993 US State  Department
     Report.  The relevant passage from that report, which  has  also  been
     put before us by Ms Gill, reads as follows:

           "The country's small Sikh and Hindu communities, once  totalling
           some 50,000, continued to dwindle as their members emigrated  or
           became refugees in the wake of the intense religious violence to
           which they were subjected in  some  urban  areas  following  the
           destruction of the Iodia Mosque in India in December 1992."


  4. That was the position before the Taliban  came  to  power.   When  the
     Appellant made his claim, he was asked the basis of  it  and  he  said
     this:

           "Although the Mudareen wished us to convert religion,  we  could
           still practice our religion, but since the Taliban took  control
           3ï¿½ years ago, matters worsened."


      Since then, he has expanded on his claim.  He says that he was subject
      to treatment which amounted to persecution on grounds of his religion,
      both in December 1992 and December 1993.  He has also given an account
      of his experiences under the Taliban, but it is right to say  that  he
      did not arrive in  the  United  Kingdom  until  some  time  apparently
      shortly before 13th January 2000.


  5. There cannot be any doubt that the situation  in  Afghanistan  at  the
     present time is different from what it has been in the past.  Although
     we accept that the situation is  not  stable,  it  is  not  a  Taliban
     government or, despite what Ms Gill has pressed upon us, a  Mujahideen
     government.  The government is that which has been set  up  under  the
     Bonn agreement and we accept Mr Blundell's submission that  it  has  a
     wide geographic and ethnic base.

  6. There is a further matter which we must set out  before  reaching  our
     conclusions on this appeal.  It is this.  The Secretary  of  State  is
     said, in a letter which we have seen, to take the view  that  enforced
     returns to Afghanistan are not appropriate at the present time.   That
     indication is contained in a letter of today's date from Kate  Pooler,
     a Protection Assistant in the UNHCR office in  London.   We  set  that
     letter out in full.
           "Re: Sikhs in Afghanistan


           We are in receipt of your facsimile  of  21  May  in  which  you
           request  information  on  the  return  of  unsuccessful   asylum
           applicants of the Sikh minority in Afghanistan.


           At the outset, it should be stated that UNHCR advocates a  case-
           by-case approach to asylum  applications  and  to  questions  of
           return, with due weight being given to the individuals merits of
           each case.


           UNHCR is closely observing the developments in Afghanistan.  The
           situation remains complex and several factors need to  be  taken
           into  account  in  assessing  the   safety   of   returns.    As
           Afghanistan, after so many decades of conflict, takes its  first
           steps towards peace under the interim government,  the  security
           situation remains  unstable  and  it  is  not  readily  apparent
           whether the international  community  along  with  international
           organisations  are  able   to   satisfactorily   guarantee   the
           protection  of  those  returning  to  Afghanistan.   Nor  is  it
           certain, the extent to  which  tribal  affiliations  and  ethnic
           affinities  that  have  been  a  prime  cause  for  discord   in
           Afghanistan, will impact upon issues of return.  In light of the
           situation on the ground, UNHCR takes the view that there  should
           be no enforced returns to Afghanistan at the present  time.   It
           is our understanding at this stage that the  Home  Office  holds
           the same view.


           We hope that you find this of assistance."


  7. We have to say, with regret, that if Ms  Gill  finds  that  letter  of
     assistance, her experience is not shared by us.  We read the letter as
     referring to those who are not refugees under the Convention,  despite
     its source in the UNHCR.  The reason for that reading is firstly, that
     in the case of a person who was a refugee, the UNHCR would, we assume,
     remind the reader that return would  be  prohibited  rather  than  not
     advised.  Secondly, we note that the letter was  written  specifically
     on the basis of being about  an  unsuccessful  asylum  applicant.   Of
     course, we do not know why Ms Gill was asking about such a person, but
     the letter appears to be predicated on the situation of a Sikh who  is
     not a refugee.  What is said there is that even if a person is  not  a
     refugee, if he is an Afghan citizen, he should not be returned.


  8. That may or may not be a justifiable view, but it is of no  assistance
     in this appeal because, following the decision of the Court of  Appeal
     in Saad and given that the decision in this case predates  the  coming
     into force of the Human Rights  Act  and  of  the  1999  Act,  we  are
     concerned simply with the following question:   Has  the  Appellant  a
     well-founded  fear  of  persecution  for  a   Convention   reason   in
     Afghanistan at the present time?

  9. The basis for any fear that he has, insofar as related to a Convention
     reason, would be his membership of  the  Sikh  community,  a  minority
     community in Afghanistan, and indeed if Ms Gill's submissions  are  to
     be accepted, a tiny minority.  We have today pressed Ms Gill  to  show
     us evidence relating to the persecution of Sikhs in Afghanistan.   She
     has readily acknowledged that there is no  evidence  relating  to  the
     persecution of Sikhs at present.  She  attributes  the  lack  of  such
     evidence to the tininess of the minority.  We, of course, accept  that
     where a group is tiny, there may be little evidence  of  its  welfare.
     But, given that the burden of proof is on the  Appellant,  we  see  no
     justification for assuming that the lack of evidence of persecution of
     Sikhs means that Sikhs are or would be persecuted.

 10. Ms Gill further asks us to assume that the situation as it was in  the
     early 1990s, when the Mujahideen were in  power,  would  continue  now
     that the government established under the Bonn agreement is in  power.
     She was unable to tell us why we should assume that the Mujahideen, or
     any similarly intolerant faction, is likely to have responsibility for
     the affairs and welfare of the Appellant.   The  situation  is  simply
     that there is no reason to suppose that the Appellant would, or might,
     be treated, in the way that he claims to  have  been  treated  in  the
     early 1990s under the Mujahideen government.

 11. Indeed, the only contemporary evidence that we have seen  relating  to
     Sikhs is to the opposite  effect.   Mr  Blundell  produced  some  late
     evidence to which Ms Gill, very properly, did not raise any objection.
      Amongst that evidence are news reports from the Tribune of India  and
     also from, perhaps rather surprisingly, the Detroit Free Press.  Those
     articles relate, in part, to the attitude of the current government in
     Afghanistan to Sikhs and, in particular, to matters discussed during a
     visit by the interim Head of Government in Afghanistan  to  Washington
     and New York in February.  We will set out the relevant parts of those
     reports.

 12. In the Tribune of India is  a  report  dated  December  11,  2001,  as
     follows:

           "Afghanistan's Interior Minister designate Younus Qanooni in the
           post-Taliban interim government scheduled to  assume  office  in
           Kabul on December 22 has impressed upon the displaced  Sikh  and
           Hindu community to return to their  hearth  and  homes  assuring
           'equal rights to all non-Muslims'.


           Mr Qanooni told a delegation of the Sikh  community,  which  had
           fled to India from Kabul and other parts of Afghanistan  because
           of the troubled and unsettled conditions in that  country,  that
           they would have proper representation of at least two members in
           the Loha Jirga or the Grand Council.


           Mr Qanooni, who spent considerable time here  yesterday  with  a
           deputation of the displaced Sikh community in  the  presence  of
           the  Afghanistan  Ambassador  to  India  Masood  Khalili  before
           departing for Kabul, emphasised that 'things will be put back on
           the rails'.


           He had some good tidings for the uprooted  Sikh  community  that
           the interim government in  Kabul  would  move  expeditiously  in
           returning the property owned by them.  Simultaneously, it  would
           consider providing necessary financial assistance to them in the
           wake of the foreign inflow for the reconstruction of war-ravaged
           Afghanistan.


           Aware of the industriousness of the Sikh community,  Mr  Qanooni
           said it was imperative to restart business and trade along  with
           other industrial activity to kickstart the battered  economy  of
           Afghanistan.  In this context he said the Sikh  community  could
           play the role of a catalyst and the interim administration would
           not be found wanting as a facilitator."


 13. In the Detroit Free Press, a report dated 24 December 2001  reads,  in
     part, as follows:

           "The ouster of the Taliban already has brought signs of  a  more
           tolerant brand of Islam entering Afghan society.


           Two weeks ago, a government official told Singh [that is to  say
           a person around whom the  article  is  based]  that  Sikhs,  who
           believe in one God and reject the caste system,  would  have  an
           office of their own in the Bureau of Islamic Affairs."


      And later:


           "In his inauguration speech, Prime Minister Hamid Karzai pledged
           to protect the laws of Islam, but he also backed the freedom  to
           practice all religions in Afghanistan and supported  the  rights
           of women, who were oppressed under Taliban rule."


 14. Finally, in the Tribune of India, in a report dated  February  1  2002
     from New York, we find this:


           "Afghanistan's interim Head of  Government  Hamid  Karzai  found
           time to assure a group representing  the  Hindus  and  Sikhs  of
           Kabul that they would be  restored  their  religious  and  civic
           rights and the properties seized from them by the former Taliban
           regime would be returned.


           The group met the Afghan leader at a  reception  hosted  by  the
           Afghans, one of a series of engagements  on  a  tight  nine-hour
           schedule here after arrival from Washington."


 15. That is the evidence currently relating to Sikhs.  Of  course,  it  is
     not evidence of the presence of Sikhs in  the  country  and  of  their
     welfare.  It is evidence that the interim government (which is, it has
     to be  said,  under  the  spotlight  of  international  reporting  and
     international supervision) is prepared to make public statements about
     its attitude to religious minorities including Sikhs.

 16. It does not appear to us that, despite the general lack of security in
     Afghanistan, and despite  the  occasional  reports  of  activities  by
     autonomous groups of Mujahideen, that there is any basis for supposing
     that the Appellant, as a Sikh, has a well-founded fear of  persecution
     in Afghanistan at the present time.  Whether he is returned  there  or
     not is, of course, an entirely separate issue, but our finding is that
     he is not entitled to status as a refugee.  We  therefore  affirm  the
     determination of the Adjudicator and dismiss this appeal.
