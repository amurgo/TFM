DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not deem it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal but  in
   order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in  the
   First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against
   a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Turquet, promulgated on 28  March
   2014  which  allowed  the  Appellant's  appeal  and  held  that  it   was
   disproportionate and unlawful under Article 8 of the European  Convention
   on Human Rights to remove her to Vietnam.

Background


3. The Appellant was born on 9 February 1990 and is a citizen of Vietnam.
4. On 1 October 2013 the Appellant  applied for leave to remain as a Tier  4
   (General) student and for a Biometric Residence Permit
5. On 4 November  2013  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
   application. The refusal letter stated that the Appellant  could  not  be
   awarded the 10 points claimed for Maintenance (funds) as she  was  unable
   to show that she had �1600 for a consecutive 28 day period in  accordance
   with paragraph 245ZX(d) as her account fell below that sum in the  period
   4 September 2013- 1 October 2013.


The Judge's Decision
6. The Appellant appealed the refusal decision stating  in  her  grounds  of
   appeal that she had �1850 in her account from 2 September  2013  but  did
   not realise that she had to have �1600 for a consecutive 28  day  period.
   Therefore she took a small amount of money from her account to buy  books
   and therefore her balance fell to �1349.34  on  19  September  2013.  She
   sought advice from the International Office  and  was  advised  that  she
   could use her father's bank statement but when the receipt  of  this  was
   delayed she panicked and sent the application off  without  her  father's
   account details. Since her application she has received  money  from  her
   father and had over �7000 in her account.
7.  The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Turquet (hereinafter called  "the  Judge")  dismissed  the
   appeal against the Respondent's decision under the Immigration Rules  but
   allowed the appeal on human rights grounds.  The  Judge  found  that  the
   Appellant was half way through her Master's degree and  had  built  up  a
   private life; there were ample financial resources available and that the
   interference with her private life in not allowing her  to  complete  her
   degree was disproportionate. He described her case as 'one of those  rare
   cases' where refusal was disproportionate.
8. Grounds of appeal were lodged and on  12  May  2014  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge Saffer gave permission to appeal stating that given what  was  said
   in Shazhad (Article 8:legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC) the grounds
   advanced by the Respondent had merit.

9. At the hearing I heard submissions  from  Mr  Deller  on  behalf  of  the
   Respondent that :

   a) The Respondent accepted the reasons given by  the  Appellant  for  the
      drop in her funds but given that she did not have �1600 in her account
      for the 28 day consecutive period her  appeal  was  doomed  under  the
      Rules.

   b) Having accepted that the Appellant did not meet  the  requirements  of
      the Rules the Judge should have stopped there: on the facts before the
      Judge and the relevant caselaw Article 8 was not engaged.

   c) Even if it could be established that Article 8 was engaged  the  Judge
      erred in relying on the old caselaw  CDS (PBS: "available": Article 8)
      Brazil [2010] UKUT 00305 (IAC), More recent authorities such as  Patel
      and others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC 72
      make clear that Article 8 did not protect the right of  a  student  to
      complete a course of studies.

   d) The Appellant did not establish that this was a  strong  private  life
      case as she came to the United Kingdom for a  temporary  purpose,  had
      been here only a short period of time and there was no evidence of her
      life beyond her studies.

   e) In assessing whether the decision was  proportionate  the  Judge  also
      erred in only considering those factors that were in  the  Appellant's
      favour: there was no consideration of the states interests and why the
      interference had taken place.

10.  Ms Do explained that she had never intended to use  the  money  in  her
   own account to establish that she could meet the requirements of the Rues
   for maintenance. She intended to use the money in  her  father's  account
   but there was a delay in him sending the necessary documents  because  he
   was on a business trip to Russia and she panicked and sent her  own  bank
   account details. She said she has now paid her tuition fees in  full  and
   she has not spent any of the money her parents sent her. She still has  a
   dissertation to submit  by  September  and  then  she  has  already  been
   accepted on a course in Switzerland to do a Post Graduate certificate  in
   Hotel management. She asks to be allowed to stay until September.

The Law

11.  Errors  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
   authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons,  ignoring  material
   considerations by taking into account immaterial considerations, reaching
   irrational  conclusions  on  facts  or  evaluation  or   giving   legally
   inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural unfairness, constitute
   errors of law.

12. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give  too
   little weight or too much weight to a  factor,  unless  irrationality  is
   alleged. Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge  to  fail  to
   deal with every  factual  issue  under  argument.  Disagreement  with  an
   Immigrations Judge's factual conclusions, his appraisal of  the  evidence
   or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of  risk  does  not  give
   rise to an error of law. Unless  an  Immigration  Judge's  assessment  of
   proportionality is arguable as being completely wrong, there is no  error
   of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge  not  to  have
   regard to evidence of events arising after his decision  or  for  him  to
   have taken no account of evidence that was not before him.



Finding on Material Error

13. Having heard  those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
   Tribunal made material errors of law.

14. The challenge in  this  case  is  limited  to  the  Judges  findings  in
   relation to Article 8. The Judge dismissed the Appellant's  appeal  under
   the Rules and the Appellant in essence accepts that she does not meet the
   requirements of the Rules in relation to funding although she  sought  to
   put that failure into context.

15. The failure  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  adequately  address  and
   determine why Article 8 was engaged outside  the  Rules  given  that  the
   Appellant failed to meet the requirements of the Rules as a  student  and
   could not have met the requirements of the Rules in relation  to  private
   life constitutes a clear error of  law.  This  error  I  consider  to  be
   material since had the Tribunal conducted this exercise the outcome could
   have been different. That in my view is the correct test to apply.

16. I find that while the Judge referred and quoted  Patel  and  other  more
   recent decisions than CDS he failed to  engage  with  the  ratio  of  the
   decisions and explain what there was about the Appellant's case that  put
   it in the category of a 'rare' case.

17. Even if the Judge was correct to consider Article 8  outside  the  Rules
   his assessment of proportionality was flawed by the failure to  have  any
   regard for the factors that weighed in the other side of the balance.

18.  I therefore set the decision of the Judge aside in relation to  Article
   8 only and indicated that subject to anything that the Appellant  had  to
   say I proposed to re hear the case.

19. Ms Do indicated that she did not seek to  have  the  case  adjourned  to
   obtain legal representation or gather other evidence in relation  to  her
   life in the United Kingdom. She was eager to proceed  as  she  wanted  to
   have sufficient time to make an application for a visa to Switzerland  in
   the event that the Respondent's appeal succeeded.

Findings

20. The Appellant is a citizen of Vietnam  who  first  came  to  the  United
   Kingdom as a student with a  visa  valid  from  5  March  2008  until  11
   November 2009. The Appellant renewed  her  visa  and  in  the  course  of
   studying in the United Kingdom  did  a  Bachelors  Degree  at  Portsmouth
   University in Accountancy and Financial Management. The Appellant made an
   application for further leave to complete an MSc  in  Financial  Decision
   Analysis at the University of Portsmouth.

21. She appealed against the decision  of  the  Respondent  made  on  the  4
   November 2013 to refuse the application made on 10 October 2013 for leave
   to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant
   under the Points Based System and for a  Biometric  Immigration  Document
   ("Tier 4 student scheme") and to make directions to remove her under  s47
   of the Immigration, Nationality and Asylum Act 2006.

22. The refusal was on the basis that the requirements  of  paragraph  245ZX
   (d) of HC 395 were not met. The Appellant was unable to show that she had
   �1600 in her account for the 28 day period 4 September 2013 to 1  October
   2013. While the determination of the Judge and indeed  the  Appellant  in
   her grounds suggested that the Appellant fell below the required level on
   one day only, 19 September 2013, in fact the  Appellant  fell  below  the
   required level for the period 18 September 2013  to  24  September  2013.
   Therefore the Appellant could not have succeeded under the Rules and  her
   appeal was properly dismissed on that basis.

23. Having found that the Appellant does not meet the  requirements  of  the
   Rules as a student the issue is whether  Article  8  is  engaged  by  the
   refusal of further leave and the issuing of removal directions.

24.  I find that the only evidence before me  as  to  private  life  in  the
   United Kingdom is that the Appellant has been in the  United  Kingdom  to
   study since 2008: there is no other evidence of relationships, friends or
   other engagement with the community.

25. I am satisfied that the court in Nasim and  others  (Article  8)  [2014]
   UKUT 25 (IAC) it held that the judgments of the Supreme  Court  in  Patel
   and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]  UKSC  72
   serve to re-focus attention on the nature and purpose of Article 8 of the
   ECHR and, in particular, to recognise that Article's limited  utility  in
   private life cases that  are  far  removed  from  the  protection  of  an
   individual's moral and physical integrity. In Nasim and  others  (Article
   8) [2014] UKUT 25 (IAC)  whilst not finding that CDS was no  longer  good
   law, it was clear that the tribunal considered that in the light of Patel
   and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]  UKSC  72
   its application was probably very limited.

26. I remind myself that in Patel Carnwath LJ said "One may sympathise  with
   Sedley LJ's call in Pankina for "common sense" in the application of  the
   rules to graduates who have been studying in the UK for some  years  (see
   para 47 above). However, such considerations do not by themselves provide
   grounds of appeal under article 8, which is  concerned  with  private  or
   family life, not education as  such.  The  opportunity  for  a  promising
   student to complete his course in  this  country,  however  desirable  in
   general terms, is not in itself a right protected under article 8".

27. I therefore find that this case was in fact  a  run  of  the  mill  case
   where the Appellant failed to meet the funding requirements of the  Rules
   while in the United Kingdom to study for a limited period. There  was  no
   evidence of any other elements of a private life in  the  United  Kingdom
   beyond that of study.

Conclusion

28. There was an error on a point of law in the decision of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal with regard to Article 8 such that the decision is set aside

29. I remake the appeal.

Decision

30. I dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds; the  decision  to  dismiss
   the appeal under the Rules stands.

Signed                                                              Date 15
