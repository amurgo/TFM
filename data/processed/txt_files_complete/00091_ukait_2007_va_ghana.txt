For the Respondent:          Mr P Deller, Home Office Presenting Officer

A person who is treated as having been given leave by virtue  of  s8A(2)  of
the 1971 Act is not thereby a person who  has  leave  "given  in  accordance
with any of the provisions of these Rules" for  the  purposes  of  paragraph
284(i) of HC 395.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, a citizen of Ghana, applied to the  Secretary  of  State
    for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as the wife of a man  present
    and  settled  here.   The  respondent  refused  her  application.   The
    appellant appealed to the Tribunal.  An Immigration Judge dismissed her
    appeal.  She then sought and obtained  an  order  for  reconsideration.
    Thus the matter comes before us.

 2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom as the holder  of  a  multiple
    entry visa showing  her  exemption  from  immigration  control  as  the
    dependant of a member of the staff of a diplomatic service.  That  visa
    expired on 23 November 2006 and it has been assumed for the purposes of
    the appellant's application and appeal that it was on  that  date  that
    she ceased to be exempt from immigration control, although as Mr Deller
    pointed out, it may be that her exemption, which is  not  derived  from
    the visa itself, ceased at an earlier date.  She married her husband on
    23 September 2006.

 3. Section 8 of the Immigration  Act  1971  is  entitled  "Exceptions  for
    seamen, aircrews and other special cases", and subsection (3)  provides
    that the provisions of the 1971 Act  relating  to  those  who  are  not
    British citizens "shall not apply to any persons so long  as  he  is  a
    member of a mission (within the meaning of  the  Diplomatic  Privileges
    Act 1964), a person who is a member of a family and forms part  of  the
    household of such a member, or a person otherwise entitled to  be  like
    immunity from jurisdiction as is conferred by that Act on a  diplomatic
    agent".  Section 8A is as follows:

        "8A.     Persons ceasing to be exempt.
        (1)      A person is exempt for the purposes of this section if  he
             is exempt from provisions of this Act as a  result  of  section
             8(2) or (3).
        (2)      If a person who is exempt -
             (a)  ceases to be exempt, and
             (b)  requires leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom as
                 a result, he is to be treated as if he had been given leave
                 to remain in the United Kingdom for a  period  of  90  days
                 beginning on the day on which he ceased to be exempt.
        (3)       If -
             (a)  a person who is exempt ceases to be exempt, and
             (b)  there is in force in respect of him leave for him to enter
                 or remain in the United Kingdom which  expires  before  the
                 end of the period mentioned in subsection (2), his leave is
                 to be treated as expiring at the end of that period."

 4. The appellant's application for leave to remain was signed by her on 10
    November 2006.  According to the grounds it was made on 6 December: the
    respondent's date stamp is 7 December 2006.  The application  fell  for
    consideration under paragraph  284  of  the  Statement  of  Changes  in
    Immigration Rules, HC 395.  One of the requirements which the appellant
    has to meet in order to be granted an extension of stay as a spouse  is
    the following:

        "284.    The requirements for an extension of stay as the spouse or
             civil partner of a person present and  settled  in  the  United
             Kingdom are that:
             (i)  the applicant has limited leave to enter or remain in  the
                 United Kingdom which was given in accordance  with  any  of
                 the provisions of these Rules other than where as a  result
                 of that leave he would not have been in the United  Kingdom
                 beyond 6 months from the date on which he was  admitted  to
                 the United Kingdom on  this  occasion  in  accordance  with
                 these Rules, unless the leave in question is limited  leave
                 to enter as a fiancï¿½ or proposed civil partner; and ... ."

 5. The ground for refusal given in the  Secretary  of  State's  notice  of
    refusal is stated as follows:

        "However, the Immigration Rules direct that a person  seeking  such
        leave is to be refused if they do not meet the requirements set out
        in the Immigration Rules ... .  This includes  that  the  applicant
        has limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom other than  where
        that leave is of 6 months' duration or less.  Therefore you do  not
        meet the requirements of having limited leave for a period of  more
        than 6 months in the United Kingdom."

 6. That reason misstates the effect of the Immigration Rules  and  is  not
    applicable to this appellant.  The Rules do not require a period of six
    months leave.  They require a period of leave which  is  not  so  short
    that the  time  between  the  last  entry  to  the  United  Kingdom  in
    accordance with the Rules and the expiry of the leave is less than  six
    months.   The  appellant  has  never  entered  the  United  Kingdom  in
    accordance with the Immigration Rules, because at her  last  entry  she
    was still  exempt.   That  particular  provision  of  paragraph  284(i)
    therefore  does  not  exclude  her.   It  was  clear  both  before  the
    Immigration Judge and before us  that  the  appellant's  problem  is  a
    different one.  Her difficulty is in showing that the leave she has is,
    in the words of paragraph 284(i), leave "which was given in  accordance
    with any of the provisions of [the Immigration] Rules".   There  is  no
    provision in the Rules for the grant of leave to a person who ceases to
    have the exemption granted by  s8(3).   Such  a  person's  position  is
    governed by s8A, and we note that, on its terms,  even  s8A(2)(b)  does
    not give leave as such: it merely requires a person to  be  treated  as
    though leave had been given.

 7. A person in the appellant's position is accordingly to be treated as  a
    person with leave for 90 days, during which, evidently, the  person  is
    not remaining without leave.  During that period  a  person  who  is  a
    beneficiary  of  s8A(2)(b)  is  entitled  to   make   any   appropriate
    application, which will fall for determination  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The advantages flowing  from  s3C  (extension  of  leave  while
    application or  appeal  pending)  will  be  available.   But  both  the
    treatment of the person as having been granted 90 days leave to remain,
    and any extension under s3C  arise  entirely  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules.  They arise from the operation of statute.

 8. Paragraph 284 has been subject to a number of  amendments.   The  words
    "which was given in accordance with any  of  the  provisions  of  these
    Rules" were inserted by Cm 6339 with effect from 1 October  2004.   The
    evident intention of that insertion was to restrict the availability of
    leave to remain under paragraph 284.  By the insertion of those  words,
    those whose existing leave had been  granted  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules  (whether  by  statute  or  otherwise)  were  excluded  from  the
    application of paragraph 284.  Those who had been admitted as  visitors
    or under the general  provisions  of  paragraph  23A  of  HC  395  were
    supposed to have been already excluded by  the  following  words.   The
    purpose  of  the  increasing  restrictions  on  the  applicability   of
    paragraph  284  is  to  prevent  "switching"  from  other   immigration
    categories into that of a spouse.

 9. Ms Boaitey argued, with her usual eloquence,  that  the  provisions  of
    s8A(2)(b) were of no assistance to anybody if they did not  assist  the
    appellant.  We disagree.  There are categories of leave  into  which  a
    person may switch whilst having (or  being  treated  as  having)  leave
    granted by statute: it merely happens that leave under paragraph 284 is
    not one of them.  In any event, as we have already said, the  grant  of
    leave enables a person to regularise his or her position after  ceasing
    to be exempt, and to make whatever arrangements are necessary,  without
    being in the position of remaining in the United Kingdom without leave.
     That is certainly a benefit.  Ms Boaitey's second principal point  was
    that the leave granted by s8A(2)(b) should be regarded as leave granted
    under the Immigration Rules for the purposes of paragraph 284.  We  are
    unable to accept that submission.  As we have indicated, the purpose of
    the insertions in paragraph 284 is to restrict the types  of  leave  to
    which it refers, and it is inconceivable in our  view  that  it  should
    have been intended that leave granted other than under the  Immigration
    Rules was intended to be encompassed in the description of leave "which
    was given in accordance with any of the provisions of these Rules".

10. The Immigration Judge, who was not assisted by the  fact  that  neither
    party appeared or was represented before him, appears to have taken the
    view that the appeal was doomed  to  failure  because  the  appellant's
    marriage was at a time when she was still exempt, when she could not be
    regarded as having been "given" leave at all.  He was wrong about that:
    the application fell to be considered on the basis  of  the  subsequent
    position, when the appellant was, under the provisions of s8A(2)(b), to
    be treated as having been given leave.  But, for the  reasons  we  have
    given, the appellant could not and  cannot  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph  284(i).   The  Immigration  Judge's  error   was   therefore
    immaterial.

11. The Immigration Judge dealt also with human rights.   The  grounds  for
    review assert that there are insurmountable obstacles to her  husband's
    accompanying her if she is removed.  The Senior Immigration  Judge  who
    granted reconsideration  did  not  order  the  reconsideration  of  the
    appellant's appeal on human rights grounds.  It appears to us that  the
    Immigration Judge's treatment of this issue was  entirely  adequate  on
    the evidence before him, and discloses no error of law.  In any  event,
    no ground at all has been shown why the appellant should not  make  any
    appropriate application from abroad.

12. For the foregoing reasons we find that the Immigration  Judge  made  no
    material error of law.  We accordingly order  that  his  determination,
    dismissing the appeal, shall stand.
