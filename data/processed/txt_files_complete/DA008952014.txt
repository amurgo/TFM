For the Appellant:     Mr Chris Avery, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms R Chapman, instructed by Asylum Aid

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   In this appeal the Secretary of State for the Home  Department  is  the
    appellant and to avoid confusion I am going to refer to her  as  being,
    "the claimant."  The respondent is a citizen of the Democratic Republic
    of Congo who was born on [ ], 1970.

Immigration History

2.   The respondent arrived in the United Kingdom on 8th October,  1993  and
    claimed asylum.  His application was refused and on 23rd June, 1999 the
    respondent was granted exceptional leave to  remain  until  23rd  June,
    2003.  His leave to remain was subsequently extended until  23rd  June,
    2006.

3.   On 3rd March, 2003, the respondent  was  convicted  of  theft,  of  two
    counts of forgery and of attempting to obtain  property  by  deception.
    As a result he was  made  the  subject  of  four  community  punishment
    orders.

4.   On 9th January, 2004 the respondent  was  convicted  of  conspiracy  to
    fraud,  handling  stolen  goods,  obtaining  pecuniary   advantage   by
    deception  for  another  and  two  counts  of  obtaining  property   by
    deception.  In respect of these offences  he  was  sentenced  to  three
    consecutive sentences of six months' imprisonment.

5.   On 25 April, 2006 the respondent submitted an application  for  further
    leave to remain which was refused by the claimant on 13 June, 2007.

6.   On 20 October, 2006 the respondent was  convicted  of  five  counts  of
    false  accounting  and  sentenced  to  a   period   of   nine   months'
    imprisonment.  He was notified of his liability  to  deportation  on  7
    October, 2006 and was detained on 18 February, 2007.

7.   On 21 March, 2007 the claimant decided to reconsider  the  respondent's
    asylum claim.  This was refused on 13 April, 2007  and  the  respondent
    was noted that the claimant had decided to  make  a  deportation  order
    against him.   His  appeal  against  deportation  was  dismissed  in  a
    determination promulgated on 16 August, 2007 and his appeal rights were
    exhausted on 28 January, 2008.

8.   The claimant signed a deportation order in respect  of  the  respondent
    under Section 5(1) Immigration Act 1971 on 19 February, 2008.

9.   It appears that the respondent then absconded  to  avoid  removal.   In
    any event, the respondent did not leave the United Kingdom.

10.  By a letter dated  27  June,  2013,  the  respondent's  representatives
    responded  to  a  letter  from  the  claimant   requesting   up-to-date
    information about the respondent and made application for revocation of
    the deportation order on refugee and  asylum  grounds.   They  asserted
    that he had been an active member of the Congolese  Resistance  Council
    since February, 2009 and that his sur place activities  meant  that  he
    would be at risk on return to DRC.

11.  Further submissions were made on 17 April, 2014.

12.  The claimant refused to revoke the deportation order in a letter  dated
    1 May, 2014.

13.  The claimant appealed and his appeal was heard by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Flynn at hearings on 2 December, 2014 and 7 February, 2015.

14.  The judge allowed the respondent's appeal, finding  that  it  would  be
    unduly harsh to expect the respondent's daughter to grow up  without  a
    father and unduly harsh to expect  the  respondent's  step-daughter  to
    leave the UK where she has spent the whole of her life and to  relocate
    to the Democratic Republic of Congo.

15.  The claimant challenged the determination and  in  granting  permission
    to appeal First-tier Tribunal Judge Davidge said this:-

         "2.  The judge recites at length the evidence  given  at  the  oral
             hearing and in the matter of two or three paragraphs  at  page
             22 of the decision makes a finding in respect of the  test  of
             'unduly harsh.'  Other than a bare assertion there appears  to
             be no reasoning in the context of a confused self-direction as
             it appears that the judge  was  conducting  a  proportionality
             exercise and reaches  [her]  conclusion  on  the  basis  of  a
             reduction in  the  weight  to  be  attributed  to  the  public
             interest.


         3.   The judge did not have  the  benefit  of  the  case  of  Chege
             (Section 107D -  Article  8  -  Approach)  [2015]  UKUT  00165
             (IAC)."

16.  Mr Avery relied on the grounds and suggested that the judge had  failed
    to provide any reason as  to  why  it  would  be  unduly  harsh.   When
    considering  the  question  of  children  under  paragraph  399(a)  the
    Tribunal needed to look at both limbs  of  paragraph  399(a)  for  each
    child.  The judge appears to have been influenced by the delay, but  of
    course the respondent's appeal rights in  respect  of  the  deportation
    order were exhausted in 2008, when he should have left the country.  In
    actual fact he appears to have absconded in 2008 and did  not  come  to
    light again until 2012.  It was only after he came  to  light  in  2012
    that he applied for revocation of a  deportation  order  and  made  his
    claim for asylum.  Mr Avery suggested that the judge was wrong  in  her
    approach and simply gave inadequate reasons for finding that  it  would
    be unduly harsh.

17.  Ms Chapman drew my attention to paragraph 109 of the determination  and
    pointed out that the respondent's partner had given evidence  that  she
    would not take the children  to  the  DRC  were  the  appellant  to  be
    removed.  Further reasoning is given at paragraph 113 and  114  of  the
    determination.

18.  I asked Ms Chapman if she could explain to me what  reasons  the  judge
    had given for finding that  the  respondent's  removal  would  make  it
    unduly harsh for either of the  children  and  she  told  me  that  she
    accepted that the judge could have said more.   She  asked  whether  it
    would have made any material difference had full  reasons  been  given?
    At paragraph 105 the judge concluded  that  it  was  conducive  to  the
    public good under paragraph 398C  and  took  into  account  the  public
    interest.  She suggested that were I not with her the matter should  be
    remitted to be heard again by First-tier Tribunal Judge Flynn who would
    be  asked  to  look  at  the  matter  in  the   light   of   up-to-date
    jurisprudence.

19.  I have concluded that the judge did err by  failing  to  give  adequate
    reasons for finding that it would be unduly harsh for the  respondent's
    daughter and step-daughter to grow up in the United Kingdom without his
    presence.  I accept that it is possible that another  judge  may  reach
    the same conclusion, but the judge should have given clear reasons  for
    the finding so that anyone reading the determination  would  understand
    the reasons for it. I  have  concluded  that  the  respondent's  appeal
    against revocation of the deportation order should be heard afresh by a
    judge other than First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Flynn.   The  respondent's
    asylum appeal has been dismissed and there was  no  challenge  to  that
    decision, so that that part of it shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
