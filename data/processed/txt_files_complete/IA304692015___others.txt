                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellants are citizens of India whose dates of birth are  recorded
    as 20 April 1976, 23 June 1985 and 22 July 2013 respectively. They made
    an application to the Secretary of State for  an  EEA  residence  card.
    The applications were refused in a decision dated 27 August  2015,  for
    reasons that I need not set out herein.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 2. The appellants lodged an appeal before the  First-tier  Tribunal.  That
    appeal came before FtT Judge Kimnell, who concluded in a decision  sent
    on  1  February  2017,  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  have
    jurisdiction to determine the appeal. No findings were made in relation
    to the substance of the appeal. The Judge's conclusion was informed  by
    the guidance given by this Tribunal in Sala [2016] UKUT 00411.

 3. The appellants appealed such decision to the  Upper  Tribunal  and  FtT
    Judge Robertson refused permission in a  decision  sent  on  18  August
    2017.

Directions by Upper Tribunal

 4. On 30 August 2017 the appellants  made  an  application  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal for  permission  to  appeal.  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Macleman
    granted permission  in  a  decision  sent  on  25  September  2018  and
    indicated that the Upper Tribunal was minded to find an error  of  law,
    set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and remit the case to
    the First-tier Tribunal. If either of the parties was opposed  to  this
    course they were directed to inform the  Tribunal  in  writing  (giving
    reasons), not later than 7 days from the  date  these  Directions  were
    sent. Following that period, the parties were informed that  the  Upper
    Tribunal would issue its decision.

 5. The Upper Tribunal has not received any  relevant  correspondence  from
    either party within the stipulated timeframe.

Discussion

 6. The Court of Appeal has now given consideration to the  very  issue  in
    play in the instant case - see Khan v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755. The Court  concluded  that  the  Upper
    Tribunal had been wrong in its conclusion and rationale in Sala.  It is
    not in dispute that the effect of the decision in Khan, if  applied  to
    this case, is that the First-tier Tribunal was wrong to  conclude  that
    it did not have jurisdiction in these appeals.

 7. For this reason, I set aside the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    and remit the appeals back to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  be  heard
    afresh.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

The appeals are remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.


Signed:                                               Dated: 17 October
