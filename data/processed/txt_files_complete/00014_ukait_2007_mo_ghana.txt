Whilst the 14 year rule  as  set  out  in  paragraph  276B(i)(b)  and  (ii)
presupposes applicants with some history of illegal or unlawful  residence,
its inclusion of a public interest  proviso  at  paragraph  276B(ii)  makes
clear that to succeed applicants must show their  circumstances  considered
as a whole do not make it undesirable for them to be given indefinite leave
to remain.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is a national of  Ghana.  He  seeks  reconsideration  of  a
determination by Immigration Judge Strowger  notified  on  18  January  2006
dismissing his appeal against a decision to refuse to grant leave to  remain
on the grounds that removal would not place the United Kingdom in breach  of
its obligations under the Human Rights Act 1998 and to give  directions  for
removal from the United Kingdom.

2. The appellant  entered  the  UK  on  29  September  1989  as  a  visitor.
Thereafter he overstayed. On 28 August 2003 he applied for indefinite  leave
to remain under the long residence rule. At the time of his  application  he
informed the Home Office that he had been using an assumed name  (CK)  which
he admitted was not his real name.

3. Paragraphs 276A-D  set  out  the  immigration  rules  dealing  with  long
residence.  Paragraph  276A  defines  "continuous  residence"  and   "lawful
residence". The structure of paragraph 276B is first to identify  two  types
of long residence  (10  years  continuous  lawful  residence  and  14  years
continuous residence) and then to apply to each a  public  interest  proviso
(paragraph 276B(ii)). A person must first show 10  years  continuous  lawful
residence or 14 years continuous residence under paragraph  276B(i).  If  he
can do that then he must show he meets the further requirement  set  out  in
paragraph 276B(ii). Paragraph 276C and D establish that if a  person  cannot
satisfy  all  the  requirements  of  paragraph  276B  he  must  be   refused
(paragraph 276D), but that if he does satisfy them all, he  may  be  granted
indefinite leave to remain (paragraph 276C). Paragraph 276B  states:

      Requirements for indefinite leave to remain  on  the  ground  of  long
      residence in the United Kingdom


      276B. The requirements to be met by an applicant for indefinite  leave
      to remain on the ground of long residence in the  United  Kingdom  are
      that:


      (i)
           a) he has had at least 10 years continuous lawful  residence  in
              the United Kingdom; or


           b) he has had at least 14  years  continuous  residence  in  the
              United Kingdom, excluding any  period  spent  in  the  United
              Kingdom following service of notice of liability  to  removal
              or notice of a decision to remove by way of directions  under
              paragraphs 8 to 10A, or 12  to  14,  of  Schedule  2  to  the
              Immigration Act 1971 or section 10  of  the  Immigration  and
              Asylum Act 1999 Act, or of a notice of  intention  to  deport
              him from the United Kingdom; and


      (ii) having regard to the public interest there are no reasons why  it
      would be undesirable for him to be given indefinite leave to remain on
      the ground of long residence, taking into account his:


      (a)  age; and


      (b)  strength of connections in the United Kingdom; and


      (c)  personal history, including character, conduct, associations  and
      employment record; and
      (d)  domestic circumstances; and


     e) previous criminal record and the nature of any offence of which the
        person has been convicted; and


     f) compassionate circumstances; and


     g) any representations received on the person's behalf.


4. The long residence rules are based  on  pre-existing  policy  concessions
known as the "10 year" and "14 year" concessions: see OS (10  years'  lawful
residence) Hong Kong [2006] UKAIT 00031 and HS (Long Residence -  effect  of
IDI September 2004) Pakistan [2005] UKAIT  00169.  These  rules  were  first
inserted into HC395 from 1 April 2003; there have  been  further  amendments
since.

5. The immigration judge accepted that the appellant  met  the  requirements
of paragraph 276B(i)(b), but did  not  accept  he  met  those  of  paragraph
276B(ii). The grounds for reconsideration contended that  it  was  wrong  of
the immigration judge to have dismissed the  appeal  on  paragraph  276B(ii)
grounds since the respondent had not taken the paragraph 276B(ii)  issue  in
the refusal letter nor had it been canvassed by the Home  Office  Presenting
Officer at the hearing or raised by the  immigration  judge.   We  can  deal
with this ground straightaway. We find it has no merit. Whilst  the  refusal
letter of 24 November 2003 does not make  specific  reference  to  paragraph
276B(ii), it is clear that its contents raised public interests reasons  for
deciding to refuse the appellant's application: see in particular  paragraph
4. Further, the appellant was represented at the hearing and it was for  him
to show that he met all the relevant requirements of the Immigration  Rules.
In any event an immigration judge is only entitled to allow an appeal  under
the  Immigration  Rules  if  satisfied  that  an  appellant  meets  all  its
requirements: see RM (Kwok On Tong:  HC395  para  320)  India  [2006]  UKAIT
00039. Ms Fielden rightly did not pursue this ground with any vigour.

6. The principal contention made in  the  grounds  for  reconsideration  was
that the immigration judge had erred in failing to understand that the  very
purpose of paragraph 276B(i)(b) taken together with  paragraph  276B(ii)  is
to regularise applicants whose stay in the UK has been unlawful: they  cited
a passage from a judgment of Sullivan  J  (Popatia  and  Chew  CO  4984  98)
stating that: "the 14-year concession is by definition applicable  to  those
who have been guilty of some breach of immigration controls". We  find  that
this contention fails. In the first place, the immigration  judge  correctly
identified the basic structure of this rule. At paragraph 16 he stated:

      "Under Rule 276B 'having regard to  the  public  interest'  indefinite
      leave may be granted (it is a  discretion)  taking  into  account  the
      listed factors under (ii) (a) to (g).  Under  276C  the  Secretary  of
      State may grant leave if each of the requirements of 276B are met."

7. Secondly,  this  contention  overlooks  that  whilst  the  provisions  of
paragraph 276B(i)(b) taken together with those  in  paragraph  276B(ii)  are
clearly intended (like the 14 year concession which preceded them) to  cater
for applications from persons not lawfully resident and so  with  a  history
of illegal or unlawful residence of some sort, they clearly  do  not  regard
everyone with such a history as  able  to  qualify.  They  impose  a  public
interest proviso. In other words, they recognise that while persons  with  a
history of illegal or unlawful residence  can  qualify  under  the  14  year
provision (paragraph  276B(i)(b))  they  will  not  qualify  if  reasons  of
public interest make that undesirable (paragraph 276B(ii)).  From  the  list
of factors set out in paragraph  276B(ii)  (a)-(g)  it  is  clear  that  the
intention behind the rule is to ensure that whether a person with a  history
of illegal or unlawful stay can nevertheless succeed will depend on  a  wide
range of circumstances, including the nature and extent of his  illegal  and
unlawful stay. It should also be kept in mind  that  the  paragraph  276A(a)
definition of "continuous residence" excludes breaks of a number of kinds.

8. Thirdly, Sullivan J's statement in Popatia and Chew was made  in  respect
of the long residence concession, whereas we are concerned  with  provisions
now contained in the immigration rules. The  terms  of  the  long  residence
concession are not to be used as an aid to interpretation of the rules:  see
OS (10 years' lawful residence) Hong Kong [2006] UKAIT 00031.

9. That brings us to Ms Fielden's next submission (based on the  third  main
ground for reconsideration) which was that, even if the requirements of  the
rule could treat illegal or unlawful  stay  (depending  on  its  nature  and
extent) as a  relevant  factor  in  deciding  whether  there  was  a  public
interest  reason  for  finding  that  it  would  be  undesirable  to   grant
indefinite leave, the immigration judge erred in law in the way he  assessed
its nature and extent in this case.  She  contended  that  even  taking  the
appellant's deception (which she sought to summarise as use of a false  name
to gain employment) at its highest, that did not suffice  as  a  reason  for
finding it undesirable in the public interest for  indefinite  leave  to  be
given to this appellant.

10. We note that Ms Fielden  did  not  repeat  the  wording  given  to  this
argument in the grounds for reconsideration. This  spoke  of  it  not  being
sufficient to amount to any of the "exceptions listed in paragraph 276B  for
withholding indefinite leave". That wording misreads  paragraph  276B  (ii):
the list given in 276B(ii) (a)-(g) is not one  of  "exceptions";  it  merely
sets out relevant factors or considerations.

11. Returning to the argument as advanced by Ms Fielden,  we  see  no  basis
for regarding the immigration judge as having failed to  take  into  account
all the considerations set out in paragraph 276B(ii).  At  paragraph  17  he
stated:

      "Taking the list of factors under 276B(ii) the Appellant is not of  an
      age that would make it difficult for him to return to Ghana and resume
      his life there. He clearly had established connections in the  UK  (as
      indeed would presumably almost anyone  applying  to  remain  after  14
      years residence) but he has family in Ghana even if he has not kept up
      close contact (no doubt exacerbated by the fact of his illegal  status
      that has prevented him from visiting Ghana). Most of the other factors
      broadly favour the Appellant and the exercise by the Respondent of his
      discretion but there are significant provisos.  Whilst  the  Appellant
      has produced good character references and  has  evidenced  employment
      and self-employment for periods of the 14 years,  his  whole  personal
      history and conduct in the United Kingdom has been based on a life  of
      deliberate deceit. As his Representative noted in  the  letter  of  11
      August 2003 the Appellant "has committed a most  serious  offence".  I
      agree with that comment. "

12. Ms Fielden sought to argue that this assessment was an unreasonable  one
for three main reasons. It failed to differentiate between persons  who  had
gone to ground and persons (like the appellant) who  had  not  hidden  their
whereabouts. It also failed to give the appellant any credit  for  the  fact
that the only reason why he had used a false identity  (alongside  his  own)
was so that he could work and avoid  claiming  public  funds.   Thirdly,  it
failed to take account of the fact that the appellant had only been able  to
"clock up" a lengthy residence because of the failure of  the  Secretary  of
State to pursue criminal charges or  take  enforcement  action  against  him
earlier.

13. We do not see that the immigration judge was required by the  provisions
of paragraph 276B to make the differentiations  urged  by  Ms  Fielden.  She
herself accepted that the appellant's use of a false identity was a  serious
matter and indeed, accepted that it could be viewed as within  the  category
of  a particularly serious crime. The fact that such conduct may  have  been
less serious than other types of conduct does  not  make  it  wrong  for  an
immigration judge to regard it as a  weighty  factor  counting  against  the
appellant under this rule.  In any event it is clear that when  weighing  up
the appellant's circumstances the immigration judge took fully into  account
that the appellant had worked.  We  also  find  no  merit  in  Ms  Fielden`s
submission that the immigration judge failed to take into account  that  the
appellant's situation was a consequence of Home Office  inaction.  This  was
not a case of someone simply  continuing  to  stay  in  the  United  Kingdom
living and working illegally or without authority. This was a case of a  man
who had taken active steps to use deception by employing  a  false  identity
when it suited him. He did this within a very short  time  of  arriving.  As
correctly noted by the immigration judge:

      "he used that false identity to deceive his employers (who  might  not
      have otherwise  employed him as an illegal immigrant), the  Department
      of Health and Social Security, the  Inland  Revenue,  Hackney  Borough
      Council, at least one credit card company...,  Barclays  Bank  and  no
      doubt many others".

14. Ms Fielden's argument amounts to a plea that the appellant  be  able  to
benefit from his own wrongdoing, notwithstanding the  length  of  time  over
which it was carried out and its serious nature. Even if, to use her  words,
the appellant's offence of using a false identity  was  not  "causative"  of
the Home Office inaction, it was properly treated by the  immigration  judge
as a weighty factor telling against the appellant when deciding whether  for
public interest reasons it was undesirable or not for the  appellant  to  be
given indefinite leave.

15. Ms Fielden,  quite  properly,  did  not  seek  to  pursue  any  separate
arguments under Article 8 beyond raising the point  that  in  her  view  the
immigration judge was wrong to say  in  paragraph  18  that  to  reward  the
appellant's deceit by giving him indefinite leave  would  also  "inevitably"
reward his partner as well, notwithstanding that  she  was  here  unlawfully
just like him. Her point was that in fact, even if the appellant  succeeded,
his partner would still need to go abroad to apply for entry  clearance.  We
see nothing at all in this point. Whether or not the partner would  have  to
go abroad, success for the appellant would have  provided  a  viable  option
for the partner to seek to apply under the immigration rules to  be  in  the
United Kingdom as an unmarried partner/fianc�e or spouse.

16. For the above reasons we conclude that the  immigration  judge  did  not
materially err in law. Accordingly his decision dismissing  the  appellant's
appeal must stand.
