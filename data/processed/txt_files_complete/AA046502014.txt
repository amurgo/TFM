Representation:

For the appellant:     Ms R Pickering, instructed by Broudie Jackson &
Canter
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Doris Oghagbon, with claimed date of birth of  30.11.94,
    is a citizen of Nigeria.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  Coates  promulgated  22.10.14,  dismissing  appeal  against  the
    decisions  of  the  respondent  to  refuse  her  asylum,   humanitarian
    protection and human rights claims.  The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    29.9.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  French  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    14.11.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 23.2.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below I find that there was an error of law  in
    the making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  such  that  the
    determination of Judge Coates should be set aside.

 6. The relevant history to the appeal can be summarised  as  follows.  The
    appellant arrived in the UK on 17.8.12 and claimed asylum on entry. The
    Secretary of  State  refused  her  application  on  3.5.13.  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Osborne heard the subsequent appeal on 12.7.13.  In  the
    decision promulgated on 31.7.13, Judge Osborne dismissed the appeal  on
    all grounds. The judge accepted the age  assessment  of  the  appellant
    being over 20 years of age, finding that  she  had  not  been  truthful
    about her age claim. The judge found that she  was  not  trafficked  to
    Italy for the purpose of prostitution, as claimed, but was an  economic
    migrant who subsequently voluntarily worked as a prostitute. The  judge
    did not accept that she had claimed asylum in  Italy.  The  judge  also
    found that she would not be at risk on return to Nigeria  as  a  single
    parent female with a young child.

 7. The appellant did not seek to appeal the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and became Appeal Rights Exhausted  on  6.9.13.  However,  the
    appellant  did  not  leave  the  UK  and  on   24.3.14   made   further
    representations, which were accepted by the Secretary of State as a new
    claim. This was refused by a decision made on  16.6.14,  together  with
    removal directions. It was the appeal against this decision which  came
    before Judge Coates on 29.9.14.

 8. As Judge Coates noted at �27, in many respects  the  appellant's  fresh
    claim was a repetition of the  claim  considered,  refused  and  appeal
    dismissed  in  2013.  Following  Devaseelan,  Judge  Coates   correctly
    considered that previous decision as the  starting  point.  It  is  not
    binding on the second Tribunal, but the second Tribunal is not  hearing
    an appeal against it. Whilst each new application is to be  decided  on
    its own merits, it is generally to be regarded by the  second  Tribunal
    judge as an authoritative determination of the issues of fact that were
    before the first Tribunal.  Generally,  the  second  judge  should  not
    revisit findings of fact made by the first on  the  basis  of  evidence
    that was available to the appellant at the time of the  first  hearing.
    If issues and evidence on the first and second appeals  are  materially
    the same, the second Tribunal should treat the issues as settled by the
    first decision rather than allowing the matter to be relitigated.

 9. I note that the appellant did not seek to appeal the decision of  Judge
    Osborne. In Chomanga (binding effect of unappealed decisions)  Zimbabwe
    [2011] UKUT 00312 (IAC) the Tribunal held that the parties are bound by
    unappealed  findings  of  fact  in  an  immigration  judge's  decision.
    However, Upper Tribunal Judge Latter goes on that state that  different
    considerations may apply when there is relevant fresh evidence that was
    not available at the time of the hearing, or a change in circumstances,
    or new events.

10. Judge Coates had summarised the appellant's core claim, between �16 and
    �27 of the decision and went on to consider, as stated at �30,  whether
    there is any new  evidence  or  change  in  circumstances  which  would
    justify a different  outcome.  The  judge  considered  the  appellant's
    evidence. As there had been some change in circumstances, including the
    birth of her child on 16.10.12, the judge went  on  to  consider  those
    issues, including the appellant's mental health and in particular PTSD,
    and whether there was any risk on return for the appellant or her child
    returning to Nigeria, including the claim of risk  of  FGM.  The  judge
    concluded at �39 the appellant is not suffering  from  any  significant
    mental illness and at �43 that there was no risk of  serious  harm  for
    the appellant or her child on return to Nigeria.

11. In granting permission to appeal, Judge French considered  it  arguable
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in law by failing to  consider
    the expert report of  Abigail  Stepnitz,  the  judge  being  under  the
    mistaken impression that this report had been considered at the time of
    the earlier First-tier Tribunal decision.

12. It is correct that the judge was in error in  the  observation  at  �42
    that the report of Abigail Stepnitz had been before the Tribunal at the
    first appeal hearing. As Judge French pointed out, the report is  dated
    21.2.14 and I can see from the preliminary passages that it  was  based
    on an assessment of the appellant on 3.2.14 and that  the  decision  of
    Judge Osborne features in the list of materials considered. It  follows
    that Judge Osborne could not have considered this report.

13. However, the decision asserts both at �8 and �42 that Judge Coates took
    the report of  Ms  Stepnitz  into  account,  together  with  all  other
    evidence submitted on the appellant's behalf. The erroneous observation
    that Judge Osborne had considered the report is neither here nor there,
    and thus not material, provided it has in fact been considered by Judge
    Coates.

14. It is not necessary for a  judge  to  set  out  or  summarise  all  the
    evidence placed before the Tribunal, although it must be clear that the
    judge has taken account of material matters and not  taken  account  of
    immaterial matters.

15. The matter is complicated further by the fact  that  the  Secretary  of
    State accepted the new  submissions  as  a  fresh  claim,  taking  into
    account, as is clear from �2 of the refusal  decision,  of  the  expert
    evidence of Ms Stepnitz.

16. The Rule 24 response of the Secretary of State, dated 25.11.14, asserts
    that Ms Stepnitz's report is clearly based on the assumption  that  the
    appellant's account is credible; it is  accepted  in  its  entirety  in
    order to reach the conclusion that her account is  both  plausible  and
    consistent with the experience of others.

17. Despite the Rule 24 response, Mr McVeety told his instructions are that
    the Secretary of State accepts that there has been  an  error  of  law.
    Because it had been accepted that the expert report was new evidence it
    should have been taken into account by Judge Coates.  However,  neither
    that concession nor the  reasoning  for  it  can  be  binding  on  this
    Tribunal, though it might well be  relevant  to  the  fairness  of  the
    process leading to the second appeal dismissal.

18.  Judge  Osborne  gave  clear  and  cogent  reasons  for  rejecting  the
    appellant's factual account. After considering what is essentially  the
    same factual trafficking claim in the  context  of  all  the  evidence,
    Judge Coates also found that the  appellant's  overall  credibility  is
    poor, relying not only on the respondent's  refusal  letter  and  Judge
    Osborne's  decision,  but  Judge  Coates'  own  consideration  of   the
    evidence. At �30 Judge Coates stated that she had found nothing in  any
    new evidence or  change  of  circumstances  to  justify  any  different
    outcome.

19. However, perhaps because the judge mistakenly  believed  Judge  Osborne
    had already considered the report of Ms Stepnitz, there  was  no  overt
    consideration of that expert report in  the  decision  or  any  of  the
    matters in the report. It was new evidence not  before  Judge  Osborne.
    Whilst matters of credibility are for the judge and not the expert,  in
    the process of assessing credibility expert opinion as to  plausibility
    and consistency with the experience of others is relevant to a  judge's
    credibility assessment. Whilst it has been stated that all evidence and
    this report in particular has been taken into account, the decision  of
    Judge Coates does  not  demonstrate  any  engagement  with  the  expert
    report, or provide reasons for rejecting the  expert  opinion.  I  also
    find that it would be unfair for the appellant not have had the  report
    taken into consideration and actively address when it was the basis  on
    which the Secretary of State accepted  the  new  representations  as  a
    fresh claim.

20. In the circumstances, I am persuaded that there is a material error  of
    law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  by  failing  to  engage
    with the expert report such that it must be set aside and remade.

21. I have also considered the other grounds  of  appeal  but,  like  Judge
    French, find that they have little merit and would in  themselves  have
    been insufficient to set aside the decision of Judge Coates.

22. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The error of the First-tier Tribunal Judge vitiates all other  findings
    of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been
    a valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

23. In all the circumstances, I relist this appeal for a fresh  hearing  in
    the First-tier Tribunal, I do so on the basis that this is a case which
    falls squarely within the  Senior  President's  Practice  Statement  at
    paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of  the  error  has  been  to  deprive  the
    appellant of a fair hearing and  that  the  nature  or  extent  of  any
    judicial fact finding which is necessary for the decision in the appeal
    to be re-made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
    in rule 2 to deal with cases fairly  and  justly,  including  with  the
    avoidance of delay, I find that it is appropriate to remit this  appeal
    to the First-tier Tribunal to determine the appeal afresh.



Conclusion & Decision:

24. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the decision in the appeal to be made afresh  in
                    the First-tier Tribunal.

Consequential Directions

25. The appeal is to be listed for a fresh hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal sitting at Stoke, with an estimate of 3 hours;

26. No findings of fact are preserved from the decision of Judge Coates;

27. The appeal should not be heard by Judge Osborne, Judge Coates,  or,  by
    reason of remarks made in the course of the error of  law  hearing,  by
    Judge Pickup;

28. An interpreter in Pidgin English is required, to be female if possible.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
