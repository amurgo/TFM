                            DECISION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Helena Suffield-Thompson),  sitting  at  Newport  on  3
    November 2016, to  a private and family life appeal by a citizen of the
    Philippines, born 1983.

 2. The appellant was here with leave as a student from 2009 - 11.  He  met
    his partner [KF] earlier in that stay, but they  got  together  towards
    the end, and in December 2012 moved in together, first of  all  at  her
    parents'. Both of them confirmed before the judge  that  they  knew  by
    then that the appellant was an overstayer with no right to be here.

 3. However on [ ] 2014 the appellant and his partner had a son,  [C].  She
    has now been granted British citizenship, though when  she  signed  her
    statement she had yet to apply for a passport. In any case, she already
    had indefinite leave to remain, and so their son was a British  citizen
    by birth, and holds a passport showing that. The appellant  has  helped
    to support his family by working, almost inevitably cash in hand, as  a
    waiter.

 4. On 10 February 2015 the  appellant  made  a  private  and  family  life
    application. This was refused on 4 November that year, under the  Rules
    on  the  basis  that  he  did  not  have  a  'genuine  and   subsisting
    relationship' with  Kathleen,  nor  any  active  rï¿½le  in  their  son's
    upbringing. There were no 'very significant obstacles' to his return to
    the Philippines, and in those circumstances  his  application  was  not
    considered to raise any exceptional reasons why it  should  be  granted
    under article 8.

 5. It was accepted before the judge that the appellant did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules; so the only issue for her was on article  8.
    Here she made the following commendably robust  findings  at  paragraph
    33:

       "The Appellant and his  partner  invoke  little  sympathy  from  this
       Tribunal as he was aware of the terms of his visa and chose to ignore
       the Rules of the UK. To compound matters he now openly accepts he  is
       not working legally but is  working  "cash  in  hand",  thus  evading
       paying tax. Were it not for the child I would have no  hesitation  in
       refusing the Appellant's application  as  I  would  find  that  [his]
       removal ... was legitimate and proportionate  to  maintain  effective
       immigration control."

 6. However the judge noted the terms of the Home Office  policy  guidance:
    she cited the 2010 policy, but the 2015 one, still apparently in force,
    is in similar terms.

       "Save in cases involving criminality,  the  decision-maker  must  not
       take a decision in relation to the  parent  or  primary  carer  of  a
       British Citizen where the effect of that decision would be to force a
       British child to leave the EU, regardless of the age of that child."

 7. The judge referred to the guidance, and summarized it  as  saying  that
    there would be exceptions, but "... mainly in relation  to  criminality
    of an Appellant or appalling immigration history which is not the  case
    here". 'Appalling' is perhaps an over-emphasis of the guidance,  as  it
    still stands, including (see 11.2.3) "a very poor immigration  history,
    such as where the person has repeatedly and deliberately  breached  the
    Immigration Rules".

 8. The judge went on to refer to Abdul (section 55 - Article 24(3) Charter
    : Nigeria) [2016] UKUT 106 (IAC), cited by Mr Davison,  though  for  no
    further purpose than to extract the following citation from the Charter
    on the Rights of the Child:

       "(3) Every child shall have the right to maintain on a regular  basis
       a personal relationship and direct  contact  with  both  his  or  her
       parents, unless this is contrary to his or her interests."

    She found that the appellant looked after his son  while  Kathleen  was
    out on 12-hour shifts at work, and that they  had  "...  a  significant
    amount of contact and ... a close bond". Removing the  appellant  would
    have "a huge negative impact on the child".

 9. The judge  then  considered  the  effect  of  s.  117A  and  B  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. She did not set  out  the
    provision to which she referred, but clearly it was s. 117B (6):

              'In the case of a person who is not  liable  to  deportation,
          the public interest does not require the person's removal where-
        a) the person has a genuine and  subsisting  parental  relationship
           with a qualifying child, and
        b) it would not be reasonable to expect  the  child  to  leave  the
           United Kingdom.'

10. Having made the findings of fact she did, the judge concluded that "...
    the balance comes down in favour of [the child's] article 8  rights  as
    against the principle of legitimate immigration  control,  and  allowed
    the appeal. That decision was challenged by the respondent on the basis
    that it did not take account of MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705.

11. While that decision does not seem to have been cited to  the  judge  by
    either  side,  as  it  should  have  been,  especially  as  both   were
    represented by  counsel,  it  was  of  course  binding  on  her.  After
    extensive consideration of the legislation and authorities,  the  Court
    of Appeal (Elias LJ giving  the  only  reasoned  judgment)  decided  to
    follow a previous decision of the Court, and hold  (see  paragraph  45)
    that 'wider public interest considerations' must be taken into  account
    when applying the reasonableness criterion in  s.  117B  (6).  As  made
    clear at paragraph 101, these include, not only the immigration history
    of the child's parents, but "all other aspects of the public interest".

12. At paragraph 38 the judge had noted the difficulties likely to be posed
    by delay and lack of  funding  in  the  appellant's  returning  to  the
    Philippines and applying for a visa to rejoin his family here. While on
    the authorities these were not relevant considerations on the  question
    of whether he could be removed, that was not one  of  the  respondent's
    grounds of appeal.

13. These challenged the judge's decision on the basis that she "... should
    have taken into account the appellant's immigration history,  the  fact
    that he had been working illegally and has been a tax evader,  as  well
    as the circumstances of the family as a  whole  in  relocation  to  the
    Philippines, rather  than  deciding  the  'reasonableness'  point  "...
    solely on the basis of the best interests of the child alone".

14.  As  Mr  Davison  pointed  out,  the   judge   had   considered   those
    considerations quite expressly at paragraph 33. The question for me  is
    whether she did so in a way which brought them into her decision on the
    'reasonableness' point. She was certainly entitled to  have  regard  to
    the policy guidance in  doing  so;  but  not  without  considering  the
    requirements of the law as a whole, including,  though  not  cited,  MA
    (Pakistan). The point where she mentions it at  paragraph  35  (11.2.3)
    refers to "a very poor immigration history, such as  where  the  person
    has repeatedly and deliberately breached the Immigration Rules".

15. The judge may have been generous in not finding  that  the  appellant's
    four years' overstaying and working without paying  tax  did  not  come
    into that category, but that is not directly the  basis  on  which  her
    conclusion is challenged. The 11.2.3 policy guidance appears by way  of
    an exception to the general rule at 11.1, which she had  cited  earlier
    (see 6). That means an exception to the principle, in the  first  place
    on the basis that the child "...  could  otherwise  stay  with  another
    parent ... in the UK".

16. That is of course the position of the child in this case. He  can  stay
    with  his  mother,  whether  or  not  she  chooses  to  return  to  the
    Philippines (from where she too originally came)  with  the  appellant.
    The difficulty with the judge's decision in this  case,  realistic  and
    comprehensive as it was,  is  that  she  seems  to  have  excluded  the
    appellant's immigration history from her  consideration  altogether  on
    the 'reasonableness' point, on the basis that it did  not  satisfy  her
    interpretation  of  the  policy  at  11.2.3.  Once  she  reaches   that
    conclusion at paragraph 35, there is no further reference to it in  her
    decision on 'reasonableness'.

17. In my view, what the judge needed to do, having noted the terms of  the
    policy,  was  not  to  exclude  the  appellant's  immigration  history,
    including his employment history, but to continue to consider it,  when
    answering the question posed by MA (Pakistan)  at  paragraph  101  (see
    10). The phrase 'all other aspects of the public  interest'  of  course
    includes the considerations set out in s. 117B (2) -  (4),  and,  while
    the judge will be fully entitled to rely on the findings  of  fact  she
    made on the appellant's family life with his son, as well as  what  she
    said about his history, she will need to take account of  the  admitted
    facts on (4), and make findings of fact on (2) and (3) in reaching  her
    decision on 'reasonableness' under (6).
