For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                             DECISION & REASONS

1.    The Appellant is a national of the DRC born on 6 September 1984.   She
arrived in the United Kingdom on 28 May  2008  and  claimed  asylum  on  the
basis that she was a member of the MLC. This application was refused  on  14
November 2008 and her appeal against this decision was dismissed  by  First-
tier Tribunal Judge Zucker  on  6  February  2009.  Further  submissions  in
support of a fresh asylum and human rights claims were made on 12 July  2011
and refused on 6 July 2012 but  following  judicial  review  the  Respondent
agreed to reconsider the claim on 29 September 2012. On  18  February  2014,
the Respondent treated the submissions as  a  fresh  claim  but  refused  to
grant the Appellant asylum, humanitarian protection or  discretionary  leave
to remain. The Appellant appealed against this decision and her appeal  came
before First-tier Tribunal Judge Andonian for hearing on 20 November 2015.

2.    In a decision promulgated on 8 December 2015, the First-tier  Tribunal
Judge dismissed the appeal on the basis that he did not find  the  Appellant
credible and that he did not consider that she had a  well-founded  fear  of
persecution or treatment in breach of Article 3 of ECHR  on  return  to  the
DRC.

3.    An application for permission to appeal was made on 22 December  2015.
The grounds of appeal in support of the application dated 16  December  2015
assert that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred materially in  law  in:  (i)
misdirecting himself in law by failing to apply, adequately or at  all,  the
Joint Presidential Guidance Note No 2 of 2010; Child, vulnerable  adult  and
sensitive appellant  guidance;  (ii)  failed  to  have  regard  to  relevant
evidence viz the Appellant's medical records; a country  information  report
from Freedom from Torture 2014 and the Respondent's 22 October  2014  policy
bulletin; (iii) failed to adequately engage with  the  experts'  report  and
addendum report of Dr  Blumberg;  (iv)  made  an  irrational  finding  on  a
material matter viz he made an adverse credibility finding  on  whether  the
Appellant had been raped without contemplating the expert evidence.

4.    Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Reid  on
11 January 2016 on the basis that the grounds disclose an arguable error  of
law. A rule 24 response was submitted on behalf  of  the  Respondent  on  18
January 2016 in which she submitted that the grounds failed  to  disclose  a
material error of law.

5.    At the hearing before me, Mr  Jarvis  relied  upon  a  letter  he  had
drafted on 16 February 2016, which was  on  the  court  file,  in  which  he
indicated that the Secretary of State for the Home Department  accepts  that
there are material errors in the Judge's approach to  the  medical  evidence
both at [27] and with respect to the broader medical evidence  provided.  He
invited the Upper Tribunal to de-list the case in light of the Secretary  of
State's concession, however, unfortunately this did not take place.

6.    In light of the Secretary of State's concession  that  the  First-tier
Tribunal Judge  erred  materially  in  law  and  given  that  there  was  no
objection by Mr Amunwa I find  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  erred
materially in law and I remit the appeal to be heard de novo in  the  First-
tier Tribunal.
