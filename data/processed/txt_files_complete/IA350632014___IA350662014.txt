                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellants are citizens of Bangladesh born on 21 June 1977  and  1
      January 1975 respectively. The second appellant is the partner of  the
      first appellant and appeals as  his  dependant.  The  first  appellant
      (hereinafter "the appellant") has been in the UK since September  2006
      in order to study  and,  latterly,  as  a  Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)
      Migrant. He obtained an MBA from the University of Greenwich in  2011.
      He and a business partner,  Mr  Ali  Baqar,  decided  to  start  up  a
      business. They did not have their own money to invest in the  business
      so they secured the agreement of Nomisma Venture Capital LLP  to  make
      available ï¿½50,000 for investment in their new business.


   2. On 10 July 2014 the appellant applied in-time for further leave  as  a
      Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  The  respondent  did  not  accept  the
      evidence of investment funding from Nomisma and the appellant was  not
      awarded the 75 points he needed for Attributes: access to funds, funds
      held in regulated institution and funds  disposable  in  the  UK.  His
      application  was  refused  by  reference  to  paragraph  245DD(b)  and
      Appendix A of the Immigration Rules, HC395. The  reasons  for  refusal
      were confined to the following  point.  In  line  with  paragraph  41-
      SD(d)(i)(6) of Appendix A of the  rules,  the  confirmation  from  the
      venture capitalist firm that it had the money available to  invest  in
      the business must include confirmation that it  is  regulated  by  the
      Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") and  is  listed  as  permitted  to
      operate as a venture capital firm. A search of the Financial  Services
      Register found no trace of Nomisma. The respondent also  reserved  the
      right to verify the documents provided and to carry out an  assessment
      of the genuineness of the business.


   3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. After a hearing  on
      23 January 2015, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Wright dismissed the
      appellant's appeal both under the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Rules  and  on
      Article 8 ECHR grounds. In relation to the former he reasoned that the
      rules required the body which provided confirmation that  third  party
      funding was available must include in its  confirmation  that  it  was
      regulated by the FCA and therefore permitted to operate as  a  venture
      capitalist firm. It was not in dispute that Nomisma was not listed  as
      permitted to operate as a venture capital firm and  that  it  was  not
      regulated directly by the FCA. Accordingly the appellant did not  have
      access to funds for the purposes of the rules. Even if he  were  wrong
      in finding that indirect regulation through Nomisma's parent  company,
      Providentia  Capital  LLP,  would  satisfy  the  rules,  Judge  Wright
      reasoned in the alternative that Nomisma could still not be said to be
      listed as permitted to operate as a venture capital firm.


   4. The grounds seeking permission to appeal argued the  judge's  analysis
      was flawed because Providentia, which was regulated by  the  FCA,  had
      permission to operate in the way  it  did.  In  fact,  the  FCA's  own
      website showed that there  was  no  requirement  to  register  venture
      capital  firms.  A  venture  capital  firm  can  only   be   regulated
      indirectly, as in the case of Nomisma and Providentia.


   5. The First-tier Tribunal found the application  was  out  of  time  and
      refused to extend time. Reasons were  also  given  why  permission  to
      appeal would have been refused on the basis the judge's interpretation
      of the rules was correct.


   6. The appellant renewed his application to the  Upper  Tribunal,  having
      enlisted alternative representation. The grounds essentially made  the
      same point about the relationship between Providentia and Nomisma  and
      suggested the judge did not give sufficiently close attention  to  the
      "expert report" which had been provided explaining this.


   7. Permission to appeal was granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Symes.
      He did not consider the timeliness point  but  granted  permission  as
      follows:


         "It seems to me that there is a question of  law  here  as  to  the
         proper construction of Table 4 and whether or not direct regulation
         is the only form of regulatory supervision envisaged by Appendix A,
         and that there is enough in the report by Daniel Tunkel, a  Partner
         in Howard Kennedy Fsi LLP, to cast doubt on whether the  First-tier
         Tribunal's reasoning is a conclusive answer to the appeal."


   8. The respondent filed a rule 24 response opposing the appeal.


   Adjournment


   9. On 15 February 2016 I handed  the  representatives  the  result  of  a
      Companies House search showing that Nomisma was dissolved on 18 August
      2015. I asked Mr Biggs whether he had any evidence  that  the  company
      was now trading and  had  funds  to  invest.  He  asked  for  a  short
      adjournment to make enquiries, which I granted. On returning, he  said
      he had been unable to progress the matter and his client  was  unaware
      that Nomisma had been dissolved. He requested an adjournment  to  seek
      clarification of the current position, which I  granted.  Plainly,  if
      the company had been dissolved and funds were no longer available from
      that source, this would be highly  material  to  the  outcome  of  the
      appeal. However, the appellant had been taken by surprise by this  new
      point and fairness demanded that he have at an  opportunity  to  rebut
      it.


  10. Prior to the adjournment, I mentioned the fact  the  Upper  Tribunal's
      grant  of  permission  to  appeal  had  not  considered  whether   the
      application had been made in time. Mr Biggs said it appeared there had
      been two applications to the First-tier Tribunal  and  the  first  had
      been in time. In any event, I indicated I would be  minded  to  extend
      time, if necessary, because the  file  showed  that  the  First-tier's
      decision had not been sent to the appellant personally but only to his
      then representatives, Immigration 4U.


   Error of law
  11. At the resumed hearing Mr Alam said he had not been aware that Nomisma
      had ceased trading. However, I pointed out that his  client  had  been
      present at the adjourned hearing and Mr Alam did not  seek  a  further
      adjournment.


  12. No evidence has been filed showing that Nomisma is now trading. In the
      circumstances, any error on  the  part  of  the  Judge  could  not  be
      material.


  13. Mr Alam argued there had been a breach of procedural fairness and  the
      respondent  should  grant  the  appellant  further  time   to   secure
      alternative funding. He argued the  circumstances  were  analogous  to
      those considered in  Thakur  (PBS  decision  -  common  law  fairness)
      Bangladesh [2011] UKUT 00151 (IAC) and Patel  (revocation  of  sponsor
      license - fairness) India [2011]  UKUT  00211  (IAC).  However,  as  I
      indicated, I did not  consider  the  circumstances  were  in  any  way
      analogous. The situation in which the appellant finds himself  is  not
      the  result  of  actions  by  the  respondent  while  considering  his
      application but simply the result of Nomisma going out of business.


  14. The Court of Appeal in EK (Ivory Coast) v SSHD [2014]  EWCA  Civ  1517
      made this very point, explaining the limits of the public law duty, in
      paragraph 38 of the judgment of Sales LJ:


         "But that requirement was found to arise where  there  had  been  a
         change of position of which the Secretary of State was  aware,  and
         indeed which she had  brought  about,  in  circumstances  in  which
         students were not themselves at fault in  any  way,  but  had  been
         caught out by the  action  taken  by  the  Secretary  of  State  in
         relation  to  which  they  had  had  no  opportunity   to   protect
         themselves."


  15. I find Judge Wright's decision does not contain a  material  error  of
      law such that it must  be  set  aside.  His  decision  dismissing  the
      appeals is confirmed.
