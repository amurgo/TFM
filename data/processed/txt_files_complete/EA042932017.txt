Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Karim
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of Ms Obiageri against the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal in a decision promulgated on 5 October 2018 in which  her
    appeal against the refusal of a residence  card  was  dismissed.   That
    decision was challenged on the basis that the judge's  conclusion  that
    the marriage was one  of  convenience  could  not  stand  in  light  of
    inadequacy of reasoning.

2.   We understand from Mr Duffy and from Mr Karim, who appeared  on  behalf
    of the appellant today, that it is common ground between them that  the
    judge erred and we think that is entirely realistic.  The determination
    is a very short one and a very large number of questions was  asked  of
    each of the parties, the appellant and her  husband  whose  appeal  was
    successful and in the circumstances we  agree  that  the  reasoning  is
    inadequate.

3.   Clearly the matter  as  a  consequence  will  have  to  be  dealt  with
    entirely and in full and so the matter must be  remitted  back  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for a hearing at Taylor House.

No anonymity direction is made.
