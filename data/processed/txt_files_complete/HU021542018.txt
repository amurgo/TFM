                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Respondent

 1. The Respondent, Satsoruban Sundaralingam (the Applicant) is  a  citizen
    of Sri Lanka born on 23 May 1984.  On 27 July 2006 he was  given  leave
    to enter as a student. His leave was extended in  different  capacities
    several times, eventually expiring on 29 May 2016.  On 25 May  2016  he
    applied for indefinite leave to remain as a Tier  4  (General)  migrant
    which application 17 January 2017  he  varied  to  an  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain on the basis of 10 years' continuous law for
    residence.

The SSHD's Original Decision

 2. On 20 December 2017 the Appellant (the SSHD)  refused  the  application
    because  the  Appellant  did  not   meet   the   relevant   suitability
    requirements of paragraphs 276B and 322(5) of the  Immigration  because
    having regard to the public interest it was undesirable  to  grant  him
    indefinite leave in the light of his conduct.  The reasons letter of 20
    December 2017 deals with this in the last  few  paragraphs  on  page  4
    which are so brief on the point as to be almost confusing.  It  appears
    that the SSHD takes two separate points against the Applicant.

 3. The first point is that the Applicant had failed accurately in time  to
    file a complete tax return and had under-declared his  income.  He  had
    failed to declare in his tax return for the year ending  5  April  2011
    all his income from Pay As You Earn employments  of  �10,783.   He  had
    declared only �7,183 of such income.  The error had been  corrected  on
    26 April 2016.  The income in question arose from his  employment  with
    ASER Consultancy.  The difference is  shown  in  the  tax  calculations
    issued by HM Revenue & Customs on  26  April  2016  E5  of  the  SSHD's
    bundle: it was a difference of �3600 on which it  would  appear  income
    tax at 20% (�720) had not been paid.

 4. The second point is that the  Applicant's  declared  total  income  was
    �37,627 (on the revised assessment) which was significantly  less  than
    the income of �46,223.59 declared on the Applicant's application  of  1
    April 2011 for further leave under the Points-Based System.  The impact
    of the difference of some �8596.59 would have been that  on  the  lower
    figure the Applicant would have been awarded  20  points  for  earnings
    instead of the 25 points he was actually awarded.

Proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal

5.   By a decision promulgated on 26 September 2018 Judge of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Chamberlain found that the Applicant's omission to declare the
    earnings from Aser Consultancy of �3600 was an  innocent  mistake.   On
    that basis she allowed the appeal against the decision under  paragraph
    322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  She then dealt with  the  Applicant's
    claim outside the Immigration Rules based his private and  family  life
    in the United Kingdom and allowed the appeal on human rights grounds.

6.   On 19 October 2018 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Saffer granted  the
    SSHD permission to appeal because the  Judge  had  not  given  adequate
    reasons for  accepting  the  Applicant's  explanation  for  the  under-
    reported income, namely that it was an accountant's error in the  light
    of the jurisprudence in two judicial  review  decisions  cited  in  the
    grounds for appeal but which were not before the Judge or indeed before
    the Upper Tribunal.  Further, the Judge had arguably erred  in  law  by
    failing to address the second  point  under  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
    Immigration Rules outlined in paragraph 4 of this decision.



Proceedings in the Upper Tribunal

Submissions for the SSHD

7.   Ms Isherwood referred to the difference between the Applicant's  income
    declared for tax and the income declared to the SSHD in his application
    for further leave under the Points-Based  System.   She  described  the
    difference as "almost �10,000".  Mr Paramjoorthy intervened to say that
    the issue was the under-declared PAYE income.

8.   Ms Isherwood continued that the Applicant had a first-class  degree  in
    accounting and finance and to a tribute the under-declaration of income
    to an omission on the part of his accountant was not  the  end  of  the
    matter.  The explanation given by the Applicant at paragraphs 1 and six
    of his statement was inadequate.  She referred me  extensively  to  the
    judgment of Martin Spencer J in R (Shahbaz Khan)  v  SSHD  (dishonesty,
    tax return, para.322 (5)) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC).  At paragraph 34  of
    his  judgment  Spencer  J  had  acknowledged  that  a  mistake  in  the
    completion of tax returns may be "a genuine error on the  part  of  the
    accountants" or an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the  SSHD.
    The Judge had not given adequate consideration to the range of possible
    explanations before reaching her conclusion.  She relied on the  agreed
    submissions at paragraph 26 of R (Khan).  The Judge had erred  and  her
    decision should be set aside.

Submissions for the Applicant

9.   Mr Paramjoorthy noted that the judicial review  decisions  referred  to
    in the SSHD's grounds for appeal and in R (Khan) were  not  before  the
    Judge.  It was accepted that the SSHD was  entitled  to  be  suspicious
    because  of  the  late  admission  of  a  previous   under-declaration,
    particularly if it was sought to place the blame on an accountant.  The
    question whether the Applicant had practised deceit had been put to him
    directly at the hearing before the Judge as she recorded  at  paragraph
    18 of her decision.  The Judge went on to make a clear finding that the
    Applicant had not practised deceit and had  given  a  satisfactory  and
    honest explanation for the under-declaration and had accepted  that  it
    was an innocent mistake.  There was no material error  of  law  in  her
    decision which should be upheld.

10.  He went on to address the issue raised by Ground three  of  the  SSHD's
    permission application that the Applicant was responsible and could not
    properly seek to shift that  responsibility  to  his  accountant.   The
    Judge had dealt with this in her decision and had found  in  favour  of
    the Applicant.  The decision should be upheld.

Response for the SSHD

11.  Ms Isherwood responded that the submissions for the Applicant  did  not
    address the issue of the declaration of total income in the Applicant's
    2010/2011  tax  return.   He  could  not  put  all  the  blame  on  his
    accountant.  He had a degree in accountancy and finance and had  signed
    the returns.  There was no explanation why it was not until early  2016
    the Applicant had reported the  under-declaration  and  he  had  failed
    adequately to address this in his statement.

Reconvened hearing

12.  Subsequent to the hearing on 06 December I decided to seek  submissions
    on whether the Applicant had truthfully represented his earnings to the
    SSHD when he had sought further leave.  In  the  event  the  Tribunal's
    administration listed the appeal for a reconvened hearing. Prior to the
    hearing each party  made  further  written  submissions  and  Applicant
    submitted further copies of documents extracted from bundles previously
    submitted  with  a  letter  of  27  February  2019  from  his   present
    accountants who had not been instructed during or  in  respect  of  any
    fiscal period relevant to the appeal.

Submissions for the SSHD

13.  Ms Isherwood submitted that it was incorrect to focus on the fact  that
    HMRC had not charged any penalty in respect of the  2016  amendment  to
    the Applicant's 2011 tax return. The SSHD had not queried the  earnings
    of some �46,000 which the Applicant had claimed in his application  for
    further leave and for which she had been  given  the  requisite  points
    under the Points-based System and yet he had claimed a lower figure  in
    his application for indefinite leave. The SSHD  had  explained  in  the
    reasons given to refuse the indefinite leave application that this  was
    not considered to have been an  innocent  error.  HMRC  had  found  the
    Applicant's conduct to be unreasonable as mentioned in  the  letter  at
    page 15 of the Appellant's bundle. Signing off  his  accounts  and  tax
    return was the responsibility of the Applicant  who  had  knowledge  of
    financial matters. This aspect of the  Applicant's  responsibility  had
    not been addressed by his present accountants in  their  letter  of  27
    February 2019. The latest bundle from the Applicant sought to  re-argue
    the figures of income and tax declared. For the reasons  given  at  the
    previous hearing the Judge's decision should be set aside.

Submissions for the Applicant

14.  Mr Paramjoorthy highlighted that the variance in the  relevant  figures
    was a claimed income of �46,223  in  the  Applicant's  application  and
    �37,627 disclosed in form SA 302 prepared by HMRC.  The  importance  of
    the difference was that if the Applicant's earnings for the year ending
    5 April 2011 which were relevant to his 2011  application  for  further
    leave were �37,627 and  not  �46,223  then  he  would  have  below  the
    threshold of  �40,000  and  would  have  been  awarded  fewer  (and  by
    implication insufficient) points under the Points-based System.

15.  He referred to page 11 of the bundle submitted for the  day's  hearing.
    This is a letter from  HMRC  to  the  Appellant  of  21  February  2017
    disclosing that National Insurance contributions had been paid  on  his
    earnings of �4,743.05 from Aser Consultancy for the year ending 5 April
    2011. This was income  from  employment  to  which  the  Applicant  had
    referred in  reply  14  to  the  SSHD's  financial  questionnaire  sent
    subsequent to his application for indefinite leave: see p.11 of today's
    bundle. I noted the accountants' letter of 27 February  2019  confirmed
    the Aser Consultancy earnings were income from employment.  Income  tax
    and National Insurance was deducted at source by the employer under the
    PAYE scheme.

16.  The Applicant had shown that  he  had  earned  the  income  in  2010/11
    claimed in his application for  further  leave  and  that  tax  due  in
    respect of the earnings from employment by Aser  Consultancy  which  he
    had not declared in his 2011 tax return had been deducted and  paid  by
    the employer in 2010/11. The First-tier Tribunal's decision contains no
    material error of law.

Conclusion

17.  I accept the submissions made by Mr Paramjoorthy which I have  outlined
    in the two preceding paragraphs. Consequently, I find the Applicant has
    shown that he did have the income disclosed in his 2011 application for
    further leave. I find that he has paid tax on those  earnings.  Indeed,
    the letter  of  27  February  2019  from  the  Applicant's  accountants
    suggests that the Applicant has in fact  pay  tax  twice  on  the  Aser
    Consultancy earnings: once under the PAYE scheme  and  again  after  he
    amended his 2011 tax return. The SSHD  has  not  identified  any  other
    inaccuracy,  error,  misrepresentation  or  similar  in  any   of   the
    Applicant's tax returns or applications made to the  SSHD  for  further
    leave.

18.  I conclude this factual background is what the First-tier Judge found.
    I note the guidance, in particular at paragraph 37, given in R (on  the
    application of Khan) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 384, namely:

     (i) Where there has been a significant difference  between  the  income
         claimed in a previous application  for  leave  to  remain  and  the
         income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is entitled to draw
         an inference that the Applicant has been deceitful or dishonest and
         therefore he should be refused ILR within paragraph 322(5)  of  the
         Immigration Rules.  I would expect the Secretary of State  to  draw
         that inference where there is  no  plausible  explanation  for  the
         discrepancy.

         (ii) However, where an Applicant has  presented  evidence  to  show
         that, despite the  prima  facie  inference,  he  was  not  in  fact
         dishonest but  only  careless,  then  the  Secretary  of  State  is
         presented with a fact-finding task: she  must  decide  whether  the
         explanation and evidence is sufficient, in her  view,  to  displace
         the prima facie inference of deceit/dishonesty.

         (iii)    In approaching that fact-finding task,  the  Secretary  of
         State should remind herself that, although the standard of proof is
         the "balance of probability", a finding  that  a  person  has  been
         deceitful and dishonest in relation to his  tax  affairs  with  the
         consequence that he is denied settlement in this country is a  very
         serious finding with serious consequences.

19.  In this light, it is evident the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    that paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules is not applicable to the
    circumstances of the Applicant is sustainably and adequately  reasoned,
    notwithstanding that the Judge did not refer to the  judgment  in  Khan
    reported on 3 May 2018. The decision does not contain a material  error
    of law such that it should be set aside. It shall stand and the  SSHD's
    appeal is dismissed.





SUMMARY OF DECISION

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain an error of law
    and shall stand.  The consequence is that the appeal  of  the  SSHD  is
    dismissed and the Applicant's original appeal has been allowed.

    No anonymity direction is made.
