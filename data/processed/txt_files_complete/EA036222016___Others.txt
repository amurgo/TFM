                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellants:    in person
For the Respondent:    Mr S McVeety, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The Secretary of State appealed against the decision of the  First-tier
    Tribunal promulgated  on  24  October  2016  allowing  the  appellants'
    appeals.  Before me, Mr McVeety  stated  that,  in  the  light  of  the
    evidence now produced, the Secretary of State wishes  to  withdraw  her
    appeal.

 2. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as a  whole,
    and observing that the appellants were successful before the First-tier
    Tribunal, I give such consent for the case to be withdrawn.

 3. Accordingly, with my  consent,  and  pursuant  to  rule  17(5)  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, this appeal is recorded
    as "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal". This is a Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 4. The effect of the Secretary of State's case being  withdrawn  from  the
    Upper Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal are at
    an end. There is no appeal before the Upper Tribunal and the First-tier
    Tribunal's decision, allowing the appeals, shall stand.


Signed                              Date:  27 July 2017
