For the Appellant:     Mr M Biggs, instructed by JKR Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


This has  been  a  remote  hearing  which  has  been  consented  to  by  the
parties. The form of remote hearing was video by Skype (V). A face to face
hearing was not held because it was not practicable and all issues could  be
determined in a remote hearing. The documents that I was referred to are in
the bundles on the court file, the contents of which I have recorded. The
order made is described at the end of these reasons.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 1  January  1988.   He
    appeals against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Courtney,
    promulgated on 2 April 2020, dismissing his appeal against the  refusal
    of indefinite leave to remain on human rights grounds.

2.   Permission to appeal was granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Rhys
    Davies on 4 June 2020  on  the  following  grounds:  "In  an  otherwise
    detailed and careful decision, it is arguably a material error for  the
    Judge to have concluded that the issue of deception was settled on  the
    basis of an allegation in a previous refusal letter that had  not  been
    successfully appealed. All the grounds are arguable."

3.   It was agreed by the parties that  the  judge  erred  in  law  for  the
    reasons given in the grounds for permission to appeal and the  decision
    dismissing the appeal should be set aside. It  was  agreed  the  appeal
    should be allowed on Article 8 grounds.

4.   There was no challenge to the judge's findings at  [22]  to  [39].  The
    Respondent accepted there was no basis for the judge's finding at  [40]
    that there was an extant finding  of  deception.  The  Appellant's  ETS
    result was 'questionable' and was not  relied  on  in  the  refusal  of
    indefinite leave to remain.   The  Appellant  had  accrued  ten  years'
    lawful continuous  residence  and  he  satisfied  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules. There was no  public  interest
    in removal.

5.   The judge erred in law in her decision promulgated on 2 April  2020.  I
    set the decision aside and remake it. The Appellant's appeal is allowed
    on Article 8 grounds.


Notice of decision

The Appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

The decision of 2 April 2020 is set aside.

The Appellant's appeal against the refusal of leave to remain is allowed  on
human rights grounds.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  fee  award
of any fee which has been paid or may be payable.
