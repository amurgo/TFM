Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondent/Claimant:    MGF, Co-Sponsor


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Specialist Appeals Team appeals on behalf  of  an  Entry  Clearance
    Officer from the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal on Article 8 grounds outside the  Rules  against  the
    decision to refuse her entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom  as  the
    adult dependent relative of a person present  and  settled  here.   The
    First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity  direction,  but  as  the
    claimant is a vulnerable adult I consider that she should  be  accorded
    anonymity for these proceedings  in  the  Upper  Tribunal.  It  is  not
    however necessary that her sons should be accorded  anonymity,  and  so
    the anonymity direction is limited to publication of her name.

 2. The claimant is a national of the  USA,  whose  date  of  birth  is  10
    September 1929.  She lived in the UK between 1951 and 1957 when married
    to a British national but returned to the USA after their divorce. From
    1975 she took up residence in France with her second husband. In  April
    2014 her two British national sons in the UK sponsored  an  application
    by her to join them in the UK  as  an  elderly  dependent  relative  on
    compassionate grounds.  These were summarised in paragraph  81  of  the
    application form.  MGF said that their mother  lived  alone  in  Paris,
    having been widowed in 2004.  He and his brother found it impossible to
    manage her welfare as they both lived in the UK.  She would be 85 years
    old this year.  Her helper,  who  came  in  four  nights  a  week,  had
    recently been ill with cancer, and she  would  no  longer  be  able  to
    continue to help.  His mother had no family in Paris  and  was  totally
    alone during the day.  They had found  a  residential  care  home  near
    Sevenoaks which was near where PGF lived.  Their mother was financially
    self-sufficient, receiving a trust income of approximately ï¿½85,000  per
    annum.  This should be more than sufficient for her living and  medical
    expenses.  Letters from trustees could  be  produced  as  verification.
    They intended to take out medical insurance for her in the UK.   Powers
    of attorney were being granted to the two sons.

 3. The application was supported by a letter from Lavenders Care  Home  in
    West Malling, Kent, dated 17 April 2014.  In this letter the registered
    manager of the care home said she had been recently approached  by  the
    family of CWD.  She was living alone in Paris and although she had been
    having an element of help at home, she was struggling  emotionally  and
    physically to cope.  The family felt that she would benefit from moving
    to England to be near them, and to have the extra care that they  could
    provide in her declining years.  She  had  been  in  contact  with  her
    doctor who wholeheartedly agreed that this would be best for her future
    care and wellbeing.

 4. On 6 May 2014 an Entry Clearance Officer (post reference  Paris\587555)
    gave his reasons for refusing  the  claimant's  application.   She  had
    provided evidence of her son's birth certificate showing he was born in
    the USA, but there was no evidence of his current status in the UK.  So
    he was not satisfied that he was either a British  citizen  or  present
    and settled in the UK.

 5. In order to qualify for entry clearance as an adult dependent relative,
    there had to be no  person  in  her  country  of  residence  who  could
    reasonably  provide  the  same  care.   Whilst  he   acknowledged   the
    importance of being close to family and having their  support,  he  was
    satisfied there were adequate care home facilities in France.  He noted
    that she was financially independent, and  did  not  require  financial
    support from either of her sons.  So he was not satisfied that she  was
    dependent on them and therefore refused her application under paragraph
    EC-DR.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of the Rules.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The claimant's appeal came before Judge Youngerwood sitting  at  Taylor
    House on 12 November 2014.  Both parties were legally represented.   In
    his skeleton argument on behalf of the claimant,  Counsel  cited  inter
    alia the following well-known passage from Huang and  Kashmiri  v  SSHD
    [2007] UKHL 11 at paragraph [18]:

         Human beings are social animals.  They  depend  on  others.   Their
         family, or extended family, is the group on which many people  most
         heavily depend, socially, emotionally and often financially.  There
         comes a  point  at  which,  for  some,  prolonged  and  unavoidable
         separation from this group seriously inhibits their ability to live
         full and fulfilling lives...

7.   He also cited Singh v ECO [2004] EWCA  Civ  1075  where  the  Court  of
    Appeal emphasised at paragraphs [38] and [77] that Article 8  protected
    the potential for development of family life.  He  submitted  that  the
    appellant's physical and emotional needs were inseparable.  She was  in
    an extremely vulnerable condition, such that only  close  proximity  to
    her family in the UK and tailored support  from  them,  in  conjunction
    with specialist carers, could accurately be described as adequate care.
     Her appeal did not hinge on whether  there  was  a  disparity  per  se
    between the quality of healthcare facilities in the UK as against those
    in France, but on her wider and urgent need to be cared for adequately,
    and  the  refusal  of  her  application  was  disproportionate  to  the
    legitimate aim of immigration control.

8.   Judge Youngerwood's findings were set out in  his  subsequent  decision
    at paragraphs [17] onwards.  The claimant met the  requirements  of  E-
    ECDR.2.4, namely that as a result of age,  illness  or  disability  she
    required long-term personal care to perform everyday  tasks.   But  the
    judge found that the appellant did not  meet  the  requirements  of  E-
    ECDR.25, namely that she  was  unable,  even  with  the  practical  and
    financial help of the sponsor, to obtain the required level of care  in
    the country where she  was  living,  either  because  (a)  it  was  not
    available and there was no person in that country who could  reasonably
    provide it; or (b) it was not affordable.  The  judge  found  that  the
    claimant  could  obtain  the  required  level  of   care   in   France.



9.   However, the judge found that the claimant succeeded in a private  life
    claim outside the Rules.  He directed himself that the ambit of private
    life under Article 8 was very wide,  citing  Pretty  v  United  Kingdom
    [2002] 35 EHRR 1 where at paragraph [61] the court held the  expression
    covered "the physical and psychological integrity of a person."

10.  The judge continued in paragraph [29]:

         The reality of the [claimant's] situation, as I find, is  that  she
         would, as argued before me, be  facing  a  traumatic  scenario,  in
         having to leave the apartment where she has lived for so many years
         and move from personal care,  provided  by  a  faithful,  long-term
         carer, to care provided in a care home, however excellent that care
         home might be.  It is clear that Article 8 can still be wider  than
         the ambit provided for in the Immigration  Rules,  certainly  where
         the Rules are not a complete code, and in this case, as I find, the
         [claimant's] condition is not  satisfactorily  met  in  the  Rules,
         which emphasised the need for  personal  care  in  everyday  tasks.
         Whilst I find that the care available to the [claimant]  in  France
         would meet those requirements of  everyday  care,  emphasising  the
         physical requirements of the claimant, and also  finding  that  she
         would be  able  to  communicate  reasonably  effectively  with  her
         carers, as of the present time, it is a  significant  fact,  in  my
         further view, that the [claimant] has stressed that she  would,  in
         terms, suffer by being in a French home, albeit able to communicate
         in everyday French, for the simple reason that this  would  not  be
         socially comfortable for her, given her  Anglo-American  background
         so that she is entitled to argue that, although her physical  needs
         would be met, her social needs of companionship  and  communication
         with residents in her French care home, who obviously be  entirely,
         or would be for the most part, be French, would not be met."

11.  The judge went on to consider Section 117B of the 2002 Act.   He  found
    that the claimant could clearly  speak  English,  and  was  financially
    independent.  So there  was  nothing  in  that  section  which  weighed
    against the claimant in the balancing exercise.

The Application for Permission to Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

12.  A member of the Specialist Appeals  Team  settled  an  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  on  behalf  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer.  Ground 1 was that the judge had failed to  consider
    the Nagre threshold of unjustifiably harsh consequences.  Had the judge
    applied himself to this question, he would have been bound to  conclude
    that it was not unjustifiably harsh, especially in  the  light  of  the
    sponsor's evidence that the claimant had various French friends through
    her second husband, and that she had lived  in  France  for  almost  40
    years.   Ground  2  was  that  the  judge  failed  to   give   adequate
    consideration to Section 117B.  The  judge  had  entirely  ignored  the
    requirement of sub-paragraph (1) of Section 117B.  Ground  3  was  that
    the judge had failed to consider the cases  of  Nasim  and  Others  and
    Patel, both of which served to remind decision makers  of  the  limited
    utility of Article 8 in private life cases which were far removed  from
    the protection of an individual's moral or physical integrity.  On  the
    facts found by the judge, the case revolved around a preference to live
    in the United Kingdom, rather than an interference with the physical or
    moral integrity of a claimant who had chosen not to reside  in  the  UK
    since 1957.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

13.  On 21 January  2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Mark  Davies  granted
    permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         The judge has made no reference as to whether  an  Entry  Clearance
         Officer's decision has  unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  to  the
         [claimant].  He should have done so.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

14.  At the hearing before me,  MGF  gave  me  an  update  on  his  mother's
    situation.  Her mental health had deteriorated, and  they  had  had  to
    move her to a nursing home which was an hour away  from  Paris.   There
    was only one friend in Paris who visited her at the nursing home.  This
    friend was a US citizen, who was frequently in the USA, and so was only
    able to visit occasionally.  He confirmed that he and his  brother  had
    been registered as having a lasting power of  attorney  in  respect  of
    their mother's financial affairs and also in respect of their  mother's
    health and welfare last year, as evidenced by a notice of  registration
    dated 20 August 2014 at page 45 of the appellant's  bundle  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  There was a great deal of  emotional  dependency.
    His mother was heavily  emotionally  dependent  on  both  him  and  his
    brother.  As they were not fluent French speakers, they had  a  problem
    understanding what her carers at the care home were  saying  when  they
    telephoned. He agreed with me that his mother was probably eligible for
    French citizenship (in which case she could freely enter the UK) but he
    understood  that  the  process  of  obtaining  registration  would   be
    cumbersome and protracted.

Discussion

15.  The error of law challenge mounted on behalf  of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer is that the judge did not ask himself all the right  questions;
    and, if he had asked himself all the right  questions,  he  would  have
    been bound to  find  that  the  refusal  of  entry  clearance  was  not
    unjustifiably harsh, and  hence  not  disproportionate  to  the  public
    interest in immigration control  recognised  in  sub-paragraph  (1)  of
    Section 117B of the 2002 Act.

16.  I am not persuaded that the judge  failed  to  take  into  account  any
    relevant  public  interest  considerations.   Although   he   did   not
    specifically refer to sub-paragraph (1) of Section 117B, he clearly had
    the public interest in immigration control  in  mind  when  considering
    proportionality.  He was entitled to attach great weight  to  the  fact
    that the claimant spoke English and  was  financially  independent,  as
    these were positive factors listed  in  Section  117B  which  could  be
    treated as reducing the public interest in the maintenance of effective
    immigration controls in the particular case under consideration. It was
    open to him to accept the evidence of the sons that all  the  needs  of
    the claimant in the UK would be met privately, and she would not  be  a
    burden on the UK taxpayer, either directly or indirectly.

17.   Although  the  judge  did  not  make  an  express  finding  that   the
    consequences of the proposed  interference  were  unjustifiably  harsh,
    such a finding is implied by his express findings.  He found  that  the
    claimant was facing a traumatic scenario.  He found that the claimant's
    social needs would not be met if excluded from the  UK.   His  citation
    from Pretty v United Kingdom showed that, in his view,  the  effect  of
    the  refusal  decision  was  to  violate  the  claimant's   moral   and
    psychological  integrity.   The  judge  reasonably   found   that   the
    claimant's  condition  was  not  satisfactorily  met,  or  sufficiently
    recognised by, the Rules relating to the admission of elderly dependent
    relatives.  The focus of these rules is entirely on the physical  needs
    of an elderly dependent relative. They do  not  purport  to  take  into
    account the person's psychological integrity or emotional needs.

18.  Mr Clarke submits that the judge's  conclusion  is  undermined  by  his
    earlier finding in paragraph [24] that  there  was  not  the  necessary
    dependency for a finding that the decision interfered with family life.

19.  However, the judge erred in law in  making  this  finding,  as  it  was
    inconsistent with the unchallenged evidence  and  his  other  findings.
    The judge held at the beginning of paragraph  [24]  that  there  was  a
    close and loving relationship between the claimant  and  her  sons  and
    their respective families,  who  were  naturally  concerned  about  her
    declining health and present circumstances.  The judge did  not  engage
    with the submission made by Counsel for the claimant that the effect of
    the refusal decision would be to prevent the deepening  and  enrichment
    of such family ties which would come about as a result of the  claimant
    being in close proximity to one of  her  sons  in  Kent,  and  also  to
    various grandchildren living in or near London, some of whom  had  made
    statements in support of her appeal.  The judge also overlooked two key
    pieces of evidence in finding that there was not  Kugathas  dependency.
    The first was that at the time of decision the two sons were seeking to
    obtain power of attorney over their  mother's  affairs:  not  only  her
    financial affairs, but also her health and welfare.  Secondly,  in  his
    witness statement before the First-tier Tribunal, MGF explained how his
    brother had asked JP  Morgan,  as  trustees,  to  increase  the  annual
    distribution of the trust to their mother to 4%, although this had  the
    potential of diminishing the capital which he  and  his  brother  would
    ultimately receive.  So in monetary  terms,  he  and  his  brother  had
    indirectly been giving additional financial support to their mother  in
    2013 amounting to approximately 28,500 US dollars.  In short,  contrary
    to Judge Youngerwood's finding, there  was  a  dependency  relationship
    between the claimant and her two sons at the date of decision, and  the
    facts of the case mirrored the paradigm case of  Huang.   The  claimant
    had become heavily dependent on her family in the  UK,  and  there  had
    come a point in her life when separation from  her  family  in  the  UK
    seriously inhibited her ability to live a full and fulfilling life.

20.  In conclusion, while the reasoning of Judge Youngerwood  was  erroneous
    in the one respect discussed above, the error was not material. It  was
    open to the judge to reach the conclusion that the circumstances of the
    claimant  were  such  that  the  refusal   of   entry   clearance   was
    disproportionate.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly this decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper Tribunal  by
the Entry Clearance Officer is dismissed.
