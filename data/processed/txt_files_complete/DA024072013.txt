                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I make an order prohibiting the disclosure or publication  of  any
    matter likely to lead members of the public to identify the  appellant.
    Breach of this order can be punished as a contempt  of  court.  I  make
    this order because it is the appellant's case that he is a refugee.  He
    has been disbelieved but it might be thought that identifying him in  a
    report could enhance the risk of his being ill treated in the event  of
    his return. Such a fear may not be justified but I see no reason why  I
    should run any risk of an otherwise unmeritorious appellant being  able
    to remain in the United Kingdom just because he has been identified  in
    a public report. The order is to  prevent  the  identification  of  the
    appellant and not to restrict public comments on the nature of the case
    or this decision where they can be made without  incurring  a  risk  of
    identifying the appellant.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Iran who  was  born  in  April  1979  (or
    thereabouts, the date has been disputed) and so is now about  35  years
    old.  He  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  a  decision  of  the
    respondent on 18 November 2013 to refuse to revoke a deportation order.
    The deportation order  had  been  made  on  27  January  2011  but  the
    appellant said that he could not be returned to Iran because he  was  a
    refugee or otherwise entitled  to  international  protection  and  that
    removing him would interfere disproportionately with  the  private  and
    family life of the appellant and his immediate associates.  The  First-
    tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal on all grounds.

 3. Permission to appeal was granted but I find it more helpful to look  at
    the grounds than at the reasons for giving permission.

 4. The first point taken is that the appellant is  married  to  a  British
    citizen and their child, "R" was born on  March  2013  and  so  is  now
    roughly 1ï¿½ years old and there is another child of the family, "L"  who
    was born on August 2008 and so is now  just  over  6  years  old.   The
    grounds complain that the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  have  proper
    regard for the interests of the children and particularly not  for  the
    interests of R.

 5. Ground 2 complains that the Tribunal did not have  any  regard  to  the
    appellant's wife's right  to  private  and  family  life  and  did  not
    consider if the appellant's removal was a disproportionate interference
    with her rights.

 6. Ground 3 complains that the Tribunal had no regard  to  "the  so-called
    Boultif criteria as expanded upon in Maslov v Austria [2008] ECHR 546."
      The  panel  thereby  gives  no  consideration  to  "the  nature   and
    seriousness of the offence" "the time elapsed  since  the  offence  was
    committed and the applicant's conduct during that period" to  name  but
    two of eight  factors  or  criteria  to  which  were  added  "the  best
    interests and wellbeing of  children"  and  "the  solidity  of  social,
    cultural and family ties with the host country".

 7. Ground 4 complains that the Tribunal wholly failed  to  decide  if  the
    decision  was  "proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  of  preventing
    disorder and crime and particularly the very low risk of reoffending".

 8. Against that background I look to see exactly  what  the  Tribunal  did
    decide about the private and family life of  the  appellant  and  those
    close to him.

 9. At paragraph 67 of  the  determination  the  Tribunal  noted  that  the
    appellant met his current wife in September 2011 and that he moved into
    his wife's household in June 2012.  His wife said that she was employed
    and that the appellant had  to  shoulder  most  of  the  care  for  his
    daughter R.  She did not want R to be away from her  father.   However,
    this is not a case where there was any  independent  evidence  such  as
    might be found from a social  worker  or  sometimes  a  school  teacher
    commenting on the involvement of the appellant with  his  daughter  and
    stepchildren.

10. At paragraph 77 of the determination the Tribunal found that R "is very
    young and is not reliant on her  father".   The  Tribunal  was  unclear
    about the extent of his involvement in her care and opined that she was
    of an age when she would be able to adapt  to  living  with  an  absent
    father.  The Tribunal noted that her mother would remain in the  United
    Kingdom and there were other family members who would support her.  The
    Tribunal decided there was "no dependency between L and the appellant.

11. The Tribunal decided there were no exceptional circumstances and it was
    lawful and proportionate to deport the appellant.

12. Whilst I agree with many of Mr Hodson's criticisms I am  not  persuaded
    that I should reach the conclusion he urges.

13. It is an unsatisfactory feature of the determination that  although  at
    paragraph 75 the Tribunal referred to several cases about the  approach
    to Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009  the
    Tribunal did not manage to tell us in terms what it  considered  to  be
    the best interests of the children.  I do not know why it  did  not  do
    that.  It would have been an easy thing to do.   However,  it  is  also
    plain from paragraph 77 that the Tribunal was not  persuaded  that  the
    appellant was as involved in the lives of the children as he made  out.
    R is young and her knowledge of her father is limited.  L is older  and
    will understand that the appellant is not her natural father and indeed
    she  sees  her  natural  father  regularly   (paragraph   45   of   the
    determination).

14. Whilst it may well be in the best interests of  both  the  children  to
    preserve the status quo because it is very often in the best  interests
    of both children to preserve the status quo the  Tribunal  clearly  did
    not give that need great weight in the balancing  exercise.   This  was
    not because of a misdirection of law but because they did not  consider
    it sufficiently important to weigh heavily against the need to deport.

15. There was some criticism of the Tribunal for not investigating  further
    or commenting on the appellant's propensity to reoffend.  I do not  see
    any merit in that criticism at all.  The evidence before  the  Tribunal
    was that there was "a low risk of future offending" (paragraph 43)  and
    the Tribunal proceeded on that basis.  This is not an important  point.
    That deportation is in the public good has been established  by  reason
    of his conviction.  Clearly the appellant could compound his  situation
    by further offending and it may be the case that however badly a person
    has behaved his removal might no longer seem to be in the  public  good
    if he has not been removed but has continued  to  live  in  the  United
    Kingdom and lived industriously and peacefully for  many  years.   That
    situation has not yet  come  about.  Certainly  in  SU  (Bangladesh)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  427  the
    Court of Appeal signaled that delay in removal that was not  the  fault
    of  the  respondent  was  not  normally  a  significant   factor   when
    considering revocation of a deportation order.

16. I have  reminded  myself  of  Mr  Hodson's  submissions  and  reflected
    carefully on the consequences of the legitimate criticisms he has made.
     I also remind myself that the  determination  was  written  after  the
    Tribunal formed an extremely poor view of the  appellant's  credibility
    saying at different places that he had claimed  wrongly  to  have  been
    granted asylum (which assertion was described by  the  Tribunal  as  "a
    blatant lie"), that he did not tell his wife that he had been  sent  to
    prison until shortly before an appeal hearing and had not told his wife
    "until relatively recently that he was subject to immigration bail" and
    the relationship was well-established before he told her  that  he  was
    the subject of  a  deportation  order.   The  Tribunal  refers  to  the
    appellant being able to "influence others by deception  and  lies"  and
    said at paragraph 74 that "all facets of the appellant's  private  life
    have been built upon lies and deceit".

17. It is not the function of the Tribunal to be rude but when the evidence
    supports such emphatic findings the Tribunal should not shy  away  from
    making them.  These findings have not been criticised and there  is  no
    reason to think they could be criticised in law.  They were at the very
    least a legitimate view of the appellant  supported  by  the  evidence.
    Against this background the rather skimpy explanation of their  finding
    about the appellant's role in family life not being established is much
    easier to understand.

15.  Putting everything together, although there were proper reasons  to  be
    concerned about the determination, which is why  permission  to  appeal
    was given, none of the grounds persuade me  that  there  has  been  any
    material error here and I dismiss the appellant's appeal.
