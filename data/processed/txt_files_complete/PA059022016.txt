Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms L Gardner instructed by South West Law
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698) I  make  an  anonymity  order.   Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or Court directs otherwise, no  report  of  these  proceedings
    shall directly or indirectly identify the  Appellant.   This  direction
    applies to both the appellant and to the respondent and  a  failure  to
    comply with this direction could lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.

Introduction

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Somalia who was born on  [  ]  1972.   He
    arrived in the United Kingdom on 21 December 2015 and  claimed  asylum.
    He claimed to be a member of the minority Bandhabow clan  and  to  fear
    persecution in his home area.  On 24 May 2016, the Secretary  of  State
    refused the appellant's claims for asylum, humanitarian protection  and
    under the ECHR.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 3.  The  appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Judge  Rolt
    dismissed the appellant's appeal on all grounds.  Although he  accepted
    the appellant's clan and that the appellant was at  risk  in  his  home
    area, he found that he could safely and reasonably internally  relocate
    to Mogadishu.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 4. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  on  a
    number of grounds challenging the judge's finding  that  the  appellant
    could reasonably internally relocate to Mogadishu.

 5. Permission to appeal was initially refused by the  First-tier  Tribunal
    but on 15 February 2017, the Upper  Tribunal  (UTJ  Blum)  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal.

 6. On 23 February 2017, the Secretary of State filed a  rule  24  response
    seeking to uphold the judge's decision on the basis that the  appellant
    could reasonably relocate to Mogadishu applying  the  country  guidance
    decision of MOJ and Others (Return to Mogadishu) Somalia CG [2014] UKUT
    00442 (IAC).

The Judge's Decision

 7. In finding that the appellant could reasonably be  expected  to  return
    and live in Mogadishu, the judge first set out the country guidance  in
    MOJ and Others at para 56 of his  determination.   He  found  that  the
    appellant could safely return  to  Mogadishu  where  he  would  not  be
    subjected to an Art 15(c) risk.  That finding was  in  accordance  with
    MOJ and Others and was not challenged before me.

 8. Then, the judge went on in paras  59-61  to  consider  the  appellant's
    circumstance if he returned to Mogadishu.  He accepted  that  he  would
    have  no  family  members  there  and  was  from   a   minority   clan.
    Nevertheless, he accepted that the appellant, who had previously worked
    in Ethiopia, had not established that he could not find  employment  in
    Mogadishu.  Further, his family abroad (including in the  UK)  who  had
    previously provided funds could continue to provide support.  At  paras
    59-61 the judge reasoned as follows:

         "59.     This Appellant is not from Mogadishu.  He  has  no  family
             members living there and he is from a minority clan.  However,
             he lived and worked and supported two families  whilst  living
             in Ethiopia and he did so successfully for  many  years.   His
             medical problems do  not  appear  to  be  causing  significant
             impairment and he stated that the  treatment  he  received  in
             Ethiopia assisted him.  Whilst the Appellant may  have  had  a
             limited education he is not a man who  has  not  (nor  cannot)
             work.  Whilst it appears that he obtained employment through a
             contact in Ethiopia that does not, in my judgement, mean  that
             he would not be able to secure  employment  in  Mogadishu,  as
             appears to be suggested on his  behalf.   His  family  clearly
             assisted the Appellant by raising what  must  be  considerable
             sums for his passage to the UK.  Sufficient funds were  raised
             for his mother to travel in  2015  to  Addis  Ababa.   Clearly
             finances were found and made available to him to come  to  the
             UK.

         60.  I note that the Appellant's brother states that he  could  not
             afford to assist him if he had to relocate  to  Mogadishu.   I
             find this surprising in the light of the sums that the  family
             have so far made available.  The sums  needed  to  assist  the
             Appellant to relocate in Mogadishu would be limited.  Once  he
             had arrived and secured accommodation this Appellant, who  has
             shown considerable resourcefulness would, in my judgement,  be
             able to find work in the light of the  economic  circumstances
             in Mogadishu and would then be able to be self-sufficient.   I
             do not find it credible that the family would  stop  providing
             support and assistance to this Appellant, the very person they
             thought had died in the attacks in 1991.  I see no reason  why
             the family would fail to assist  in  this  regard.   Whilst  I
             accept that the Appellant's mother and aunt are  elderly,  the
             aunt in the United States was able to raise considerable sums.
              The brother has work.  His income is limited but  he  is  not
             without means.  There is family in Ethiopia.  I  do  not  have
             any specific details of their circumstances save the assertion
             that they are of limited means.

         61.  I consider that the family have sufficient funds and/or  would
             find sufficient funds so that they would be  able  to  support
             the Appellant and that he would be able to live  a  relatively
             normal life in Mogadishu.  I do not consider that he would  be
             destitute and forced to live in an IDP camp.   This  Appellant
             could live a relatively normal life in Mogadishu as judged  by
             the standards  that  prevail  in  his  county  of  nationality
             generally."

 9. At para 62, the judge reached the following conclusion:

         "In the light of my finding I consider that it is not  unreasonable
         for the Appellant to return to Somalia and  relocate  to  Mogadishu
         and as such he does not qualify for international protection."

The Appellant's Challenge

10. Ms Gardner, who represented the appellant submitted  that  the  judge's
    reasoning was deficient for a number of reasons.

11. First, it was wrong for the judge to infer that because  the  appellant
    had worked in Ethiopia prior to coming to the UK he would  be  able  to
    find work in Mogadishu.  His work in Ethiopia had been set up through a
    friend of an aunt and he had lost that job when the shop  in  which  he
    worked was closed.

12. Secondly, Ms Gardner submitted that the judge had failed to  take  into
    account the UNHCR document "UNHCR Position on Returns to  Southern  and
    Central Somalia"  (May  2016)  which  post-dated  MOJ  and  Others,  in
    particular paras [12], [16] and [19] referring to the position  in  IDP
    camps, the pervasiveness of discrimination against minority  clans  and
    the importance of pre-identified accommodation and  livelihood  options
    in assessing whether it was reasonable to relocate.

13. Thirdly, Ms Gardner submitted that the judge had failed sufficiently to
    take into account the medical evidence concerning the appellant, namely
    that he had a bullet in his  chest  and  left  lung  damage  which  the
    evidence showed would catch up with him in a decade or two.   That  was
    relevant to his ability to find work in Mogadishu.

14. Fourthly, Ms Gardner submitted that the judge had been  wrong  to  find
    that the appellant's family could continue to support him.  His brother
    in the UK was on NASS support and in receipt of child benefit  and  tax
    credits.  She told me his net income was �4,400 (not �400 as stated  in
    the grounds).  His mother was in receipt of DWP support.  His  aunt  in
    the US was no longer able to support him.  Finally, the judge was wrong
    to state in para 60 that any support would need to be "limited" in  the
    absence of evidence to underpin that conclusion.

Discussion

15. In reaching his findings, the judge correctly referred to the  relevant
    country guidance concerning relocation to Mogadishu in MOJ and  Others.
    So far as relevant to this appeal, the relevant guidance is set out  in
    the head note at paras (vii)-(xii) as follows:

         "(vii)   A person returning to Mogadishu after a period of  absence
             will look to his nuclear family, if he has one living  in  the
             city, for assistance in re-establishing himself and securing a
             livelihood.  Although a returnee may also seek assistance from
             his clan members who are not close  relatives,  such  help  is
             only likely to be forthcoming for majority  clan  members,  as
             minority clans may have little to offer.

         (viii)   The significance  of  clan  membership  in  Mogadishu  has
             changed.   Clans  now  provide,  potentially,  social  support
             mechanisms and assist with access to  livelihoods,  performing
             less of a protection function than previously.  There  are  no
             clan militias in Mogadishu, no  clan  violence,  and  no  clan
             based  discriminatory  treatment,  even  for   minority   clan
             members.

         (ix)     If it is  accepted  that  a  person  facing  a  return  to
             Mogadishu after a period of absence has no nuclear  family  or
             close relatives in the city to assist him  in  re-establishing
             himself on return, there will need to be a careful  assessment
             of  all  of  the  circumstances.   These  considerations  will
             include, but are not limited to:

                . circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;

                . length of absence from Mogadishu;

                . family or clan associations to call upon in Mogadishu;

                . access to financial resources;

                . prospects  of  securing  a  livelihood,  whether  that  be
                  employment or self employment;

                . availability of remittances from abroad;

                . means of support during  the  time  spent  in  the  United
                  Kingdom;

                . why his ability to find the journey to the West no  longer
                  enables  an  appellant  to  secure  financial  support  on
                  return.

         (x)  Put another way, it will be for the person  facing  return  to
             explain why he would  not  be  able  to  access  the  economic
             opportunities that have been produced by  the  economic  boom,
             especially as there is evidence to the effect  that  returnees
             are taking jobs at the expense of those who  have  never  been
             away.

         (xi)     It will, therefore, only be those with no clan  or  family
             support who will not be in receipt of remittances from  abroad
             and who  have  no  real  prospect  of  securing  access  to  a
             livelihood on return who will face the prospect of  living  in
             circumstances  falling  below  that  which  is  acceptable  in
             humanitarian protection terms.

         (xii)    The evidence indicates clearly that it is not simply those
             who originate from Mogadishu that may now generally return  to
             live in the city without being subjected to an  Article  15(c)
             risk or facing a real risk of destitution.  On the other hand,
             relocation in Mogadishu for a person of a minority  clan  with
             no former links to the city, no access to funds and  no  other
             form of clan, family or  social  support  is  unlikely  to  be
             realistic as, in the absence of means to establish a home  and
             some form of ongoing financial support there will  be  a  real
             risk of  having  no  alternative  but  to  live  in  makeshift
             accommodation within  an  IDP  camp  where  there  is  a  real
             possibility of having to live in  conditions  that  will  fall
             below acceptable humanitarian standards."

16. The judge correctly identified that the appellant was from  a  minority
    clan and also accepted that he had no family in Mogadishu.   He  would,
    therefore, be unlikely to obtain support from his clan (para  (vii)  of
    the head note in MOJ and Others) and could obtain  no  assistance  from
    family in Mogadishu.  As the head note in MOJ and Others  makes  plain,
    in those circumstances the judge was required to undertake  a  "careful
    assessment of all the circumstances" including but not limited to those
    set out in the eight bullet points in para (ix) of the head note.

17. Turning now to the first and third of Ms Gardner's  points,  the  judge
    found that the appellant would likely  be  able  to  obtain  employment
    there.  That is a relevant factor made plain in para (x)  of  the  head
    note in MOJ and Others where it is  stated  that  the  "economic  boom"
    provide economic opportunity for returnees  (even  at  the  expense  of
    those who have remained in Mogadishu) and that an individual will  need
    to explain why he or she would not be able  to  access  those  economic
    activities.

18. As regards the appellant's employment in Ethiopia,  the  judge  was  no
    doubt aware of the appellant's previous employment in Ethiopia and,  as
    he specifically sets out in para 15 of the determination, that the work
    had been obtained at a shop through a contact with his aunt.  The point
    being made by the judge in para 59, however, is that the appellant  had
    experience of employment and that was relevant in assessing his chances
    of obtaining employment in Mogadishu.  The judge was not inferring that
    because the appellant had been previously employed in Ethiopia then  he
    would be employed in Mogadishu.  It was a  simple,  and  common  sense,
    point being made by the judge that past experience is a helpful feature
    when seeking future employment.

19. Further, it is  clear  that  the  judge  also  had  well  in  mind  the
    appellant's medical  problems.   He  made  specific  reference  to  the
    medical  evidence  at  para  49  of  his  determination  including  the
    respiratory problems arising from his injuries in Somalia upon which Ms
    Gardner placed some weight.  It is noteworthy that the expert  evidence
    was not that the appellant had any present significant  impairment,  in
    fact the medical evidence was that he had little by  way  of  symptoms,
    and only that his injuries might catch up with him in a decade or  two.
    The fact of the matter was that those injuries had  not  prevented  his
    ability to work previously and there was no basis upon which the  judge
    was  required  to  infer  that  they  would  cause   any   "significant
    impairment" such that he would be unable to find work in Mogadishu.

20. Turning to Ms Gardner's third point,  in  respect  of  the  2016  UNHCR
    report, it is true that the judge made no reference to it and it  post-
    dates the country guidance decision in  MOJ  and  Others.   Ms  Gardner
    placed reliance upon what is said in para 12 of  the  2016  report,  in
    particular  that:   "Members  of  minority  clans  often   lack   vital
    protection and suffer pervasive discrimination."  She also referred  to
    the statement "ethnic Bantus, as well as  some  other  minority  clans,
    reportedly continue to be highly vulnerable to  discrimination,  severe
    poverty, exclusion and marginalisation ..."  In substance, however that
    does not differ  from  the  UNHCR  evidence  considered  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal in MOJ and Others.  So, at para [343] the Tribunal dealt  with
    the UNHCR report in January 2014 and the disadvantage to minority clans
    in Mogadishu.

         "We understand that to mean that while there was no guarantee  that
         help would be available from clan members outside the close  family
         network of a returnee, at least there is more likelihood of such  a
         request being accommodated than if made to those unconnected by the
         bond of clan membership.  That is,  perhaps,  wholly  unsurprising.
         However, it should be noted that in the UNHCR January  2014  report
         the view was  expressed  that  a  returnee  might  be  rather  more
         confident of receiving help from his clan, if not a  minority  clan
         member:

             'Persons belonging to minority clans ... remain at  particular
             disadvantage in Mogadishu ... There remains  a  low  sense  of
             Somali social and ethical  obligation  to  assist  individuals
             from weak lineages and social groups.  This  stands  in  stark
             contrast to the powerful and non-negotiable obligation Somalis
             have to assist members of their own lineage'."

21. Plainly, therefore, in  formulating  the  country  guidance  the  Upper
    Tribunal had well in  mind  that  minority  clans  continue  to  suffer
    disadvantage or  discrimination.   The  Upper  Tribunal,  nevertheless,
    identified in the guidance the importance of the  "economic  boom"  and
    that jobs (such  as  waiters,  builders,  drivers,  retail  assistants)
    created by that boom were "unlikely to be filled by the  tiny  minority
    that represent 'the elite'." (at [349].  See also  at  [352]).   In  my
    judgment, the 2016 Report adds nothing of significance that could  lead
    to a different conclusion to that accepted in MOJ and Others.

22. Ms Gardner also relied upon para  19  of  the  2016  UNHCR  report,  in
    particular:

         "Where the proposed area of relocation is an urban area  where  the
         applicant  has  no  access  to  pre-identified  accommodation   and
         livelihood options, and where he/she cannot be reasonably  expected
         to fall back on meaningful support  networks,  the  applicant  will
         likely find himself or herself in a situation comparable to that of
         urban   IDPs.    Under   these   circumstances,   to   assess   the
         reasonableness of the  IFA/IRA,  adjudicators  need  to  take  into
         account  the  scale  of  internal  displacement  in  the  area   of
         prospective relocation and the living conditions  of  IDPs  in  the
         location, as well as the fact that many IDPs are exposed to various
         human rights abuses, including forced evictions." (emphasis added)

23. In my judgment, what is said by the UNHCR in para 19 can be taken as no
    more  than  indicating,  from   its   perspective,   that   access   to
    accommodation and livelihood options (whether pre-arranged or  not)  is
    relevant as to whether relocation is reasonable or  would,  in  effect,
    leave an individual living in an  IDP  camp  which  may  make  internal
    relocation not a viable option.  The point is specifically made in  the
    preceding paragraph, namely para 18, of the UNHCR report as follows:

         "For applicants for whom an IFA/IRA in Mogadishu  has  been  deemed
         relevant, the  reasonableness  of  the  proposed  IFA/IRA  must  be
         assessed.  In this regard UNHCR considers that particular attention
         must be given to the extent to which the applicant  can  expect  to
         receive genuine support from his or her immediate family or clan in
         the context of the  general  weakening  of  traditional  protection
         mechanisms; availability of  basic  infrastructure  and  access  to
         essential services in the proposed area of  relocation;  access  to
         shelter in the proposed area of relocation;  and  the  presence  of
         livelihood opportunities." (emphasis in original)

24. What is said in para 19 must, in my judgment, be seen in the  light  of
    what is said in para 18 which no more than mirrors the approach of  the
    Upper Tribunal in MOJ and Others to which the judge made reference  and
    which he applied.

25. Consequently, I reject Ms Gardner's submissions that the judge erred in
    reaching his finding  that  the  appellant  would  be  able  to  obtain
    employment and, therefore, support himself if returned to Mogadishu.

26. The effect of that may well be that any question of  whether  he  would
    continue to receive  financial  support  from  his  family  abroad  was
    immaterial to the judge's finding that the appellant  could  reasonably
    and without undue hardship relocate to Mogadishu.

27. In any event, turning now to Ms Gardner's fourth point, I do not accept
    Ms Gardner's submission that the judge was not entitled to find that at
    least, to a limited extent, his family abroad could support  him.   The
    judge was clearly aware that his aunt in the US  was  no  longer  in  a
    position to provide funds.  The judge was also entitled  to  take  into
    account that the appellant's brother in the UK was working, despite the
    fact that he was in receipt of NASS support and other  state  benefits.
    Despite that, the judge was entitled to conclude that if the  appellant
    needed some support his family would be in a position and, despite what
    they said, be willing to do so as  they  had  done  in  the  past  and,
    perhaps it might be said, as any caring and compassionate family  would
    seek to do.  Ms Gardner took issue with the judge's statement that  the
    sums needed would be "limited".  Of course, the need  for  any  support
    had to be seen in the light of the fact that the  judge  was  satisfied
    (and entitled to do so on the evidence) that the appellant would be  in
    a position to obtain some employment in Mogadishu.   Whilst  the  judge
    made no specific reference to any background evidence, the view he took
    about the costs'  implications  of  living  in  Mogadishu  is  entirely
    consistent with the level of poverty and standard of living  referenced
    in the material (see, e.g. European Commission: "Humanitarian  Aid  and
    Civil Protection" (September  2016)  at  pp.78-81  FtT  bundle)  .   Ms
    Gardner  did  not  draw  my  attention  to  any  material  which  would
    contradict what the judge said, namely that  to  survive  in  Mogadishu
    would require anything other than "limited" funds, particularly when it
    was likely that the appellant could seek employment.

28. In my judgment, applying MOJ and Others, the judge was entitled to find
    that the appellant's circumstances on return to Mogadishu would not  be
    unduly harsh and that it would be reasonable for him to relocate there.
     The judge gave adequate and sustainable reasons for  his  findings  in
    paras 59-62 of his determination and his findings were not  irrational.



29. For those reasons, the judge did not  err  in  law  in  dismissing  the
    appellant's appeal on all grounds.

30. Before me, Ms Gardner submitted  further  evidence,  including  medical
    evidence concerning deterioration in the appellant's mental health.  Mr
    Mills acknowledged that this evidence might have had a material  affect
    on any decision in respect of relocation if an error of  law  had  been
    identified and the Tribunal was remaking the decision.  However,  since
    I am satisfied that the judge did  not  err  in  law  in  reaching  his
    findings this new evidence, which was not before the judge,  cannot  be
    taken into account.  Its relevance, if any, would  be  to  any  further
    submissions made to the Secretary of State following this appeal.

Decision

31. For the above reasons, the judge did not err in law in  dismissing  the
    appellant's appeal on all grounds.

32. Accordingly, the appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
