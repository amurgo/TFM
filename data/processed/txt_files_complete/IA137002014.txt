                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State but I will refer to  the
       parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

    2. The appellant is a citizen of Australia born on 13th March 1982. She
       arrived in the UK on 20th September 2010 as a Tier 4 student migrant
       and had leave in that capacity until 26th January 2012. She was then
       granted leave as a Tier 1 post-study work migrant until 9th February
       2014. On 4th February 2014 she applied for leave to remain as a Tier
       2 migrant. This application was refused on 4th March 2014 as she was
       not awarded the relevant points under Appendix A for her salary. She
       was granted all other points under Appendix A, and full points under
       Appendices B and C. Her appeal  against  the  refusal  decision  was
       allowed by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Emerton  in  a  determination
       promulgated on the 17th December 2014.

    3. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Shimmin on the 2nd February 2015 on the basis that it  was  arguable
       that the First-tier judge had erred in law in relying upon  evidence
       beyond  that  which  is  permitted  by  s.85A  of  the  Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as he accepted  oral  evidence  that
       the appellant worked only 39 hours a week for her  stated  wage  and
       not 45 as assumed by the Secretary of State in  the  refusal  letter
       and as evidenced by the documents submitted with her application.

    4. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law

Submissions

    5. I asked Ms Isherwood to clarify  whether  it  was  accepted  by  the
       Secretary of State that  the  conclusion  at  paragraph  22  of  the
       determination was correct and thus that if this appeal succeeded the
       Secretary of State accepted that the decision would be  that  appeal
       was allowed to the extent that the decision was found not to  be  in
       accordance with the law and should be remitted to the  Secretary  of
       State. She said that this would be the correct course.

    6. Ms Isherwood relied upon the  grounds  of  appeal.  I  said  that  I
       thought I was with her, and that it was therefore best to hear  from
       Ms Rhind to see if there were further  issues  which  needed  to  be
       explored.

    7. Ms Rhind explained that she accepted that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       could not take oral or other evidence into account that had not been
       before the  Secretary  of  State  with  the  application.  She  also
       accepted  that  there  had  been  no  document  submitted  with  the
       application before the Secretary of State which showed the appellant
       worked a 39 hour  week  for  her  basic  wage,  and  thus  earned  a
       sufficient high salary to qualify under Appendix A  on  this  basis.
       She argued however that it had been open to the Secretary  of  State
       to assume that  this  was  the  case  given  the  framework  of  the
       application at Appendix J.

    8. I informed the parties that I  found  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
       erred in law, but that I would set out my full reasons  in  writing.
       Ms Rhind asked that I urge the Secretary of State to reconsider this
       matter and issue a new decision as soon as possible as the appellant
       had been waiting for over a year. I  trust  that  the  Secretary  of
       State will reconsider the matter with full evidence (which I  assume
       is now before her but if not must be submitted  immediately  by  the
       appellant) regarding the appellant's salary promptly.



Conclusions

    9. In accordance with s.85A of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
       Act the evidence in a "points based system" appeal of this  type  is
       limited to that submitted in support of and at the time of making of
       the application.

   10. The only way in which Judge Emerton could have understood  that  the
       appellant's basic salary of �26,150 was for a 39 hour week  and  not
       the 45 hour week set out on the  COS  was  from  the  oral  evidence
       (supported by other documents not submitted with the application) of
       the appellant.  He thus erred in law in allowing the appeal outright
       under the Immigration Rules as this evidence was not admissible.

   11. However Judge Emerton correctly found that the information collected
       by  the  Secretary  of  State  was  ambiguous.  Whilst  the  various
       documents and forms made it clear her average working  week  was  45
       hours and her basic pay �26,150 it  was  not  right  or  logical  to
       conclude that this was  the  pay  for  that  number  of  hours.  The
       appellant  had  provided  all  the  information  requested  by   the
       Secretary of State and done so accurately. The  Secretary  of  State
       had not however posed the right questions to obtain the  information
       on the amount of pay this appellant would  receive  for  a  39  hour
       week. She thus did not have the information needed to calculate  the
       salary rate under Appendix J of the Immigration Rules.

   12. In accordance with Naveed (Student  fairness  -  notice  of  points)
       [2012] UKUT 14 fairness required that the Secretary  of  State  seek
       further clarification of the  information  before  her  rather  then
       refuse the application given that the information before  her  meant
       it was possible the appellant met the Immigration Rules and  in  the
       context of the appellant having supplied the documents requested and
       having completed her application form in full.


          Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

   3. I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it to the extent that
      it is allowed as not in accordance with the law and  remitted  to  the
      Secretary of State for a lawful decision  based  on  full  information
      regarding the appellant's rate of pay for a 39 hour week.


Signed:                                            Date:  13th April 2015
Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley




Fee Award        Note: this is not part of the determination.

    In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by
    allowing it, I have considered whether to make a fee award. I have  had
    regard  to  the  Joint  Presidential  Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards   in
    Immigration Appeals. I have decided to make a full fee  award  as  this
    was the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and there were  no  further
    submissions on the issue by either party and of  course  the  appellant
    was entitled to a lawful decision, and no evidence which was not before
    the Secretary of State has been taken into  account  in  coming  to  my
    decision to allow the appeal.

Signed:                                            Date: 13th April 2015
