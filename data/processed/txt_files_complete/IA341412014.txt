                            DECISION AND REASONS

1) This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  by  Judge
   of the First-Tier Tribunal David Clapham allowing an appeal  by  Ms  Lien
   Anh Pham (hereinafter referred to as "the claimant").

2) The claimant was born in 1984 and  is  of  Vietnamese  nationality.   She
   applied for a variation of leave as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant.
   This application was refused.  The refusal was upheld on appeal  but  the
   Judge of the First-Tier Tribunal allowed the appeal under Article 8.  The
   Judge's decision and reasons are brief and the reasoning for allowing the
   appeal under Article 8 was expressed in the following terms:-

      "In relation to Article 8, however, I consider that the appeal  should
      be allowed.  As the appellant and her boyfriend plan to  marry  on  10
      November 2014 there is obviously a valid and  subsisting  relationship
      between them.  The relationship is evidently durable.  The  boyfriend,
      while he does not have indefinite leave to remain, has a visa that  is
      valid until 2017 and appears to be in receipt of an income  above  the
      relevant threshold.   The  fact  that  the  appellant  had  started  a
      business and also the fact that the appellant  gave  her  evidence  in
      English would seem to indicate that the appellant has  a  satisfactory
      knowledge of the English language and is not likely to be a burden  on
      the taxpayer.  Consequently, I would regard removal of  the  appellant
      as being disproportionate and I consider that  the  appeal  should  be
      allowed under Article 8."

3) Permission to appeal was granted on several  grounds.   It  was  arguable
   that the Judge misdirected himself by failing  to  take  account  of  the
   limited leave held by the claimant's partner.  The Judge arguably  failed
   to consider compelling circumstances in accordance  with  Gulshan  [2013]
   UKUT 00640, and did not take account of Section 117B of the 2002 Act,  as
   amended.

4) A Rule 24 Notice was submitted on behalf of the  claimant.   This  stated
   that as the claimant would not have qualified under Appendix FM the Judge
   was  correct  to  look  at  Article  8.   The   Judge   had   regard   to
   proportionality and although the Judge had taken a generous view  he  was
   entitled to reach the decision he did.  The Judge took account of section
   117B.

Submissions

5) At the  hearing  before  me  Mrs  O'Brien  submitted  on  behalf  of  the
   Secretary of State that the Judge had made a material misdirection in law
   and had failed to give adequate reasons for his decision under Article 8.
    Although the Judge was not required to  take  a  formulaic  approach  to
   Article 8,  the  reasons  given  fell  short  of  the  established  legal
   principles.  The claimant did not satisfy either the requirements of Tier
   1 or of Appendix FM.  Neither the claimant nor her partner  were  British
   citizens.  There was a question as  to  whether  their  relationship  was
   capable of engaging Article 8 in terms of family life.

6) Mrs O'Brien continued that the Judge had failed to  have  regard  to  the
   relevant facts despite statutory rules which would strike a fair  balance
   between the public interest and Article 8  rights.   The  Judge  did  not
   explain why he considered it appropriate to consider  Article  8  outside
   the Rules.  The Judge did not even  make  a  proper  finding  as  to  the
   existence of family life but accepted that the couple planned  to  marry.
   The Judge did not explain why Article 8 was  engaged.   Consideration  of
   Article  8  in  the  decision  was  seriously  defective.   The  relevant
   considerations were not set out for the reader of the decision.   Neither
   partner was a qualifying partner in terms of paragraph EX.1  of  Appendix
   FM.  The Judge failed  to  understand  the  issue  of  precariousness  in
   respect of private life.   Neither  member  of  the  couple  had  settled
   status.  A decision should be substituted dismissing the appeal.  On  the
   facts there was no disproportionate breach  of  Article  8.   The  couple
   would  like  to  stay  in  the  UK  but  there  was  no  disproportionate
   interference with private or family life.

7) For the claimant, Mr Winter submitted that the grounds  set  out  in  the
   application on behalf of the Secretary of State were  contradictory.   It
   was accepted in the grounds that the couple did not meet the requirements
   of Appendix FM.  The Judge followed the case of R (on the application  of
   Ganesabalan) v SSHD [2014] EWHC 2712 (Admin) at paragraph 9.  There  must
   always be consideration outside the Rules.  Mr Winter further referred to
   the decision in Singh [2015] EWCA Civ 74 at paragraphs 64 and 65 and Asif
   Ali Ashiq [2015] CSIH 31 at paragraph 5.  Mr Winter  submitted  that  the
   Judge  had  gone  on  properly  to   the   second   stage   to   consider
   proportionality.  There was no need to  show  exceptional  circumstances.
   Mr Winter referred to the case of Mirza [2015]  CSIH  28.   In  terms  of
   section 117B the claimant was lawfully  in  the  UK.   The  claimant  had
   family life with her partner.  They were not married but they were living
   together.  The Judge recorded the evidence in relation to family life  at
   paragraphs 11 and 16 of the decision.

8) Mr Winter further submitted  that  the  decision  should  be  read  in  a
   sensible manner as a whole.  The application did not establish that there
   were errors of law.  The claimant had a viable business.  She was  paying
   tax and had invested ï¿½20,000 to establish her business.   There  were  no
   weighty factors against the claimant.

9) Mr Winter further submitted that  if  there  was  an  error  of  law  the
   claimant would seek to  lodge  further  evidence.   The  closure  of  the
   business would be a relevant factor in terms of UE (Nigeria) [2012] 1 WLR
   127, at paragraph 21.  The claimant had come to the UK as a  student  and
   in this  capacity  it  did  not  appear  that  she  was  restricted  from
   establishing a business.

Discussion

10) I approach the decision of the Judge of  the  First-Tier  Tribunal  with
   the view that certain of the errors advanced on behalf of  the  Secretary
   of State are not material.  Although the Judge did not  consider  private
   or family life under the Immigration Rules, neither party considered that
   there was any prospect of success under the Immigration Rules.  The  main
   reason for this is that neither partner has settled status in the UK  and
   therefore the claimant's partner would not be  a  qualifying  partner  in
   terms of Appendix FM.  The Judge did not refer  specifically  to  section
   117B but as pointed out in the Upper Tribunal decision  in  Dube   [2015]
   UKUT 00090, this is not necessarily fatal to the  decision  provided  the
   relevant considerations have been taken into account.  The Judge did  not
   apply any intermediary test before  considering  Article  8  outside  the
   Rules but, as observed in Asif Ali Ashiq {2015] CSIH 31 at 6,  the  Judge
   was not required to do so.

11)  The  questions  I  really  must  address  are  whether  the  Judge  has
   nevertheless given adequate reasons for his decision and  had  regard  to
   all the relevant considerations.  It is in this regard that the  decision
   falls short of the legal  requirements.   In  particular,  the  Judge  is
   clearly aware that neither member of the couple has  settled  status  but
   fails to accord the appropriate significance to this factor.   The  Judge
   seems to think that because the claimant's partner has permission to stay
   in the UK until 2017 the claimant should be allowed to stay also.   There
   is nothing in statue, in the Immigration Rules or in case law to  support
   this proposition.  In reaching this conclusion the Judge takes no account
   of the public interest in immigration control,  as  set  out  in  section
   117B(1) and does not consider the  significance  of  the  fact  that  the
   couple have only ever had limited leave and therefore have no expectation
   of remaining in the UK permanently.  These are defects  in  reasoning  of
   such significance that they amount to errors  of  law  and  lead  to  the
   decision being set aside.

12) There are further errors as well that show the confusion in the  Judge's
   reasoning.  The Judge notes in his reasons that the claimant's  boyfriend
   "appears to be in receipt of an income above the relevant threshold".  It
   is not clear what the Judge means by the "relevant  threshold"  but  this
   would seem to be a reference to the maintenance requirement  in  Appendix
   FM.  It is not appropriate in  this  context  to  refer  to  Appendix  FM
   because the claimant's partner is not a qualifying partner  in  terms  of
   Appendix FM.  By referring to  the  "relevant  threshold"  the  Judge  is
   taking into account an irrelevant factor.

13) The Judge goes on to point out that  the  claimant  speaks  English  and
   that she is financially self-supporting.  While these are factors in  her
   favour in terms of section 117B they would not by themselves override the
   public interest in effective immigration control, as pointed out in AM (s
   117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260.

14) I have taken account of  the  helpful  submissions  by  Mr  Winter,  who
   produced relevant case law  to  support  the  claimant's  position.   The
   support provided, however, was only partial in that it  largely  did  not
   cover the omissions or defects in the  Judge's  reasoning  which  I  have
   found to be material. The claimant may  have  thought  that  she  was  on
   strong grounds in reliance on Mirza but a difficulty for the claimant  in
   relying on Mirza is that in that case the partner was a British  citizen,
   which the claimant's partner is not.  In  my  view  this  is  a  material
   distinction.

15) Mr Winter further submitted that if the Judge's decision  was  found  to
   contain an error of law, then there should be an  opportunity  to  submit
   further evidence.  A bundle of  further  evidence  was  produced  with  a
   covering letter dated  8th  June  2015  making  an  application  for  the
   evidence to be accepted under rule 15(2A).  The  covering  letter  states
   that the claimant and her partner are now married, that the claimant  and
   her partner have purchased  property  together,  and  that  the  claimant
   employs two additional employees in her business.  It  must  be  observed
   that all this has been done by the claimant in the knowledge that neither
   she nor her partner have indefinite leave to remain and that  her  appeal
   was still to be finally decided.  In these circumstances it is  difficult
   to accord any significant weight to such  actions.  It  is  difficult  to
   envisage how this further evidence would be so compelling as to alter the
   balance in favour of the claimant.  Accordingly I do not see a need for a
   further hearing with the attendance of witnesses.

16) Assuming that the claimant and her partner have family life together  in
   the UK, I would accept that Article 8 is  engaged.   I  accept  that  the
   claimant speaks English  and  is  financially  independent.   The  couple
   formed their  relationship  when  they  were  both  here  lawfully.   The
   claimant's partner, however, is not a "qualifying partner", as defined in
   section 117D, as a qualifying partner means a partner who  is  a  British
   citizen or is otherwise settled in the UK.  The couple have only ever had
   limited leave and have therefore no expectation of being allowed to  live
   permanently in the UK either together or separately.   The  claimant  has
   established a business in the UK but has done so in  the  knowledge  that
   she did not have indefinite leave to remain.  There is  very  little,  if
   anything, in the way of compelling circumstances, in terms of SS  (Congo)
   [2015] EWCA Civ 387 at 33, which  would  override  the  public  interest,
   expressed at section 117B(1), in the maintenance of effective immigration
   controls.  Indeed when the balancing exercise is carried out  in  respect
   of this claimant and her circumstances, even accepting that  family  life
   is engaged, the claimant's circumstances fall far short of  showing  that
   the refusal decision is disproportionate.

17) Accordingly the proper decision which  should  be  made  in  respect  of
   Article 8, and which the Judge of the  First-Tier  Tribunal  should  have
   given, is to dismiss the appeal under Article 8.

Conclusions

18) The making of the decision of the First-Tier Tribunal  did  involve  the
   making of an error on a point of law.

19) I set aside the decision.

20) I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

21) The First-Tier Tribunal did not make an order  for  anonymity.   I  have
   not been asked to make such an order and I see no reason of substance for
   making one.
