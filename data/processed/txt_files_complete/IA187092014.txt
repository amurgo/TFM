For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This appeal is not subject to an  anonymity  order  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to rule 13  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier
    Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules  2014.  Neither  party
    has invited me to make an anonymity order pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (SI  2008/2698)  and  I
    have not done so.

 2. The appellant appeals against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Khawar) dismissing the appellant's  appeal  against  a  decision
    taken on 7 April 2014  to refuse to issue a residence  card  under  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 ("the Regulations") as  confirmation
    of a right of residence in  the UK.

Introduction

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan born on 1 July 1987.  She  is
    married to Mr Harmon Singh Chopra who is a citizen of Holland born on 1
    January 1972 ("the EEA sponsor").

 4.  The  Secretary  of  State  accepted  the  respondent's  identity   and
    nationality but concluded in a decision dated 7 April 2014  that  there
    was insufficient evidence that the relationship with  the  EEA  sponsor
    was authentic or that the EEA sponsor was exercising treaty  rights  in
    the UK.

The Appeal

 5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and attended an  oral
    hearing at Hatton Cross on 27 November 2014. She was represented by  Mr
    Hodson. The First-tier Tribunal found that there was  not  a  shred  of
    evidence to suggest that the marriage was one of convenience.  However,
    judge also found that the oral evidence in relation to  the  employment
    of the EEA sponsor  was  highly  unsatisfactory  and  did  not  explain
    significant issues relating to the sponsor's employment  and  documents
    submitted. The appeal was therefore dismissed.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 6. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on  the
    basis that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Levin  on
    24 April 2015 on the basis that it was arguable that the  judge  failed
    to take into account relevant evidence, namely the EEA  sponsor's  bank
    statements which showed his wages being credited for the limited period
    from October 2013 to January 2014 and the award of child tax credits

 8. Thus, the appeal came before me

Discussion

 9. Mr Hodson submitted that there was substantial evidence  regarding  the
    existence of Heera and  Sons  including  accounts.  SK  Associates  are
    accountants and not solicitors. The documents establish  the  existence
    of the company. The respondent moved the issue on to genuine employment
    at the oral hearing. Paragraph 18 of the decision  complains  that  the
    accounts do not identify individual employees but  that  is  not  their
    purpose. HMRC evidence is normally taken as good evidence of employment
    at the level of income indicated on the P60. The bank  statements  show
    �429.15 paid on the 1st or 2nd of  each  month  with  four  entries  in
    total. The judge has not explained why the pay  slips  match  the  bank
    statements. The tax  credits  and  housing  benefit  claims  were  also
    included in the  appellant's  bundle.  The  appellant  had  to  provide
    evidence to HMRC about his work in order to obtain the tax credits. The
    judge has not engaged as to  why  the  appellant  would  declare  false
    income that would reduce his housing benefit.

10. Mr Hodson further submitted that if the judge is correct then there has
    been an extraordinarily elaborate charade. The documents  were  clearly
    not produced for this appeal. The  judge  has  failed  to  give  proper
    consideration to the context of the evidence. The employment  contracts
    appear in the appellant's bundle - the first contract shows  an  annual
    salary of �24,000 and the second contract shows no change in the  place
    of work or the hours but the rate of pay was now �6.19  per  hour.  The
    first contract also specifies a �6.19 per hour minimum wage. There  may
    have been a change from afternoon to morning working  and  the  �24,000
    salary reference may have been a simple  miscalculation.  The  evidence
    about hours worked is not contrary and the judge failed to take account
    of the totality of the evidence. The evidence needs  to  be  looked  at
    again with the EEA sponsor and respondent on notice that  this  is  the
    issue. The findings at paragraphs  10  and  11  (genuine  marriage  and
    genuine business) should be preserved.

11. Mr Kandola conceded that there is a certain amount  of  consistency  in
    the frequency of the income which is supported by the child tax credits
    and the P60s. The issue is whether the weight of the evidence points to
    only one conclusion or could the discrepancy in the oral evidence  lead
    to a different conclusion. Mr Kandola  submitted  that  the  judge  had
    adequately assessed the weight of the  evidence;  suspecting  that  the
    claimed employment was really a guise. The points raised in  paragraphs
    16 and 17 of the decision still have weight. The underlying  cause  for
    concern was valid and the findings of fact were open to the  judge.  Mr
    Kandola agreed that the appeal should go for rehearing  if  a  material
    error of law was identified and agreed with the preserved  findings  of
    fact.

12. I find that the judge failed to have regard to  the  relevant  evidence
    that was before him in relation to the payslips, bank  statements,  tax
    credits, housing benefit  claim  and  P60.  The  implications  of  that
    evidence were not properly considered and analysed. The judge also made
    a mistake as to a material fact when he found  at  paragraph  11  that,
    "There is no evidence from an independent objective source to establish
    that the sponsor is genuinely employed at his cousin's grocery  store".
    The evidence from HMRC is from an independent and objective source. The
    information supplied by the EEA sponsor was assessed by HMRC  in  order
    to make decisions about tax and tax credits. I am  satisfied  that  the
    judge's approach to the evidence amounts to a material error of law.

13. Thus, the First-tier Tribunal's decision  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal under the Regulations involved the making of an error of law and
    its decision cannot stand.



Decision

14. Both representatives invited me to order a rehearing in the  First-tier
    Tribunal if I set aside the judge's decision. Bearing in mind paragraph
    7.2 of the Senior President's Practice Statements I  consider  that  an
    appropriate course of action. I find that  the  following  findings  of
    fact made at paragraphs 10 and 11 of the decision should be  preserved;
    namely,

         . There is not a shred of evidence to suggest that the  appellant's
           marriage to the EEA sponsor is one of convenience.

         . Heera and Sons is a grocery store business owned by Mr Chopra who
           is the cousin of the EEA sponsor.

15. Consequently, I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    order the appeal to be heard again in the  First-Tier  Tribunal  to  be
    determined by a judge other than the previous First-tier judge.
