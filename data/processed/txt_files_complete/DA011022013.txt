                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against a determination of a panel
       of the First tier Tribunal composed of Judge Buckwell and Judge  Lobo
       (hereinafter referred to as 'the Panel')  promulgated  on  21st  July
       2014 following a hearing at Taylor House on the 12th  and 13th   June
       2014.


    2. The Appellant is the subject of a  deportation  order  following  his
       conviction on 18th May 2011 at Snaresbrook Crown Court on  one  count
       of conspiracy to defraud and a second count of conspiracy to  acquire
       and use property obtained as a consequence of a criminal  act.  A  65
       month term of imprisonment was imposed upon the Appellant who,  as  a
       result, was also served  with  an  order  for  his  deportation  made
       pursuant to section 32 UK Borders Act 2007.


    3. The Panel considered the evidence made  available  and  set  out  its
       findings from paragraph 100 of the determination. The conclusions are
       to be found at paragraphs 112 to 114 in the following terms:


           112.   We accept that the  Appellant  enjoys  both  private  and
                family life in this country.  Having spent some years in the
                United Kingdom a requirement that he should return  to  live
                in Nigeria would interfere with such private and family life
                rights,  thereby  engaging  Article  8   (1)   ECHR.    That
                interference,  by  way  of  the  deportation  order,  is  in
                accordance with the law in seeking to protect members of the
                public.


           113.   In assessing proportionality we strive to strike  a  fair
                balance  between  the  rights  of  the  individual  and  the
                interests of the wider community. We take into  account  all
                family members and find that the Respondent  has  discharged
                her  duty  in  relation  to  section  55  of  the   Borders,
                Citizenship and Immigration Act  2009.  Further,  Parliament
                has approved legislation which enables the removal of  those
                who have committed offences from the  United  Kingdom  where
                they are not British citizens.


           114.   We find  that  no  exceptional  circumstances  have  been
                established on the balance of  probabilities.  Additionally,
                and for the reasons we have set out above, we  do  not  find
                that the decision by the Respondent unlawfully breaches  the
                Article 8 ECHR rights of the Appellant. In response to  such
                engagement the Respondent is entitled to rely upon Article 8
                (2) ECHR. The Respondent's decision to deport the  Appellant
                was in accordance with the law and  not  in  breach  of  the
                requirements of section 6 (1) Human Rights Act 1998.


    4. The Appellant committed a number of serious offences of  an  economic
       nature. In his sentencing remarks HHJ N Sanders,  when  dealing  with
       the Appellant and his two co-accused, set out at length the nature of
       the offences and reasoning behind the sentences imposed. In  relation
       to the Appellant in this appeal the Judge stated:


           Fafore, Kareem  and  others  unknown,  you  are  involved  in  a
           sophisticated and concerted attack on the  banking  credit  card
           system by the criminal   misuse of the Internet to  fraudulently
           access  and  make  unauthorised       transfers  from  the  bank
           accounts of innocent account holders to accounts   in  the  name
           of other persons -- that is count 1 -- and acquired and or  used
           money obtained by fraudulently making unauthorised  transactions
           on the credit and debit cards of innocent account holders, count
           2.


    5. The Sentencing Judge also notes that "now that  so  much  banking  is
       done on the Internet it is essential  that  the  public  should  have
       confidence in the integrity and the security of the  system.  Actions
       which undermined that I consider to be very serious". The Judge noted
       information provided by the banking industry setting out the  overall
       size of losses suffered by way of credit card fraud which was  stated
       for 'card-not  present-frauds'  to  be  �266  million  and  for  card
       identity fraud �38 million for 2009 which for 2010 is said to be �226
       million and �38 million respectively.  The  Judge  noted  that  given
       these sorts of figures it is essential that the Courts make it  plain
       to all those who are convicted of sophisticated conspiracies of  this
       nature that they are going to be dealt with [severely]  not  only  to
       punish them but to make it plain to others  that  the  committing  of
       such offences is a very serious matter. The  same  is  also  said  to
       apply to the possession of such information.


    6. The nature of the conspiracy was said to involve the use of bogus web-
       pages purporting to be the banks genuine web page in which  customers
       are tricked into supplying details of their accounts and  credit  and
       debit cards together with passwords and the answers to the  memorable
       questions. Armed with that  information  the  accused  were  able  to
       access the accounts and transfer money to accounts which were created
       for the benefit of the conspiracy and then siphoned off  or  used  to
       make payments. By the use of  e-mail  the  details  would  easily  be
       passed around a number of conspirators.  The  Sentencing  Judge  also
       notes various methods used to try to defeat the bank's internal alert
       procedures such as in the case of a Mrs M, whose account had  �69,000
       removed from it, a new joint account being set up in the name of  Mrs
       M and a Miss S into which  funds  were  first  transferred  and  then
       amounts transferred from that account to a sole account in  the  name
       of Miss S.


    7. The Sentencing Judge notes there were 18 people originally traced and
       the total fraud attempted, excluding HBOS, in relation  to  them  was
       �251,000 of which �241,000 was successfully removed.  Within  the  e-
       mails of Kareem and Fafore  were  another  900  accounts  with  HBOS.
       Attempted �1,140,000 successful �357,000 so the totals were attempted
       �1,392,000 and successful �599,000. It is said that specific  to  the
       IP addresses there was attempted �121,000 and successful �39,000.


    8. The Sentencing Judge also noted in relation to the second count; that
       relating to cards, 15,800 cards were identified of which 10,813  were
       current. 1,451  were  specifically  identified  in  relation  to  the
       defendants in relation to  which  the  information  showed  specified
       losses of �570,000 or  an  average  of  �393  per  card.   The  Judge
       considered that in light of the  number  of  cards  involved  it  was
       appropriate to take  the  average  figure  provided  by  the  banking
       industry witness of �336 per card giving,  it  appears,  a  potential
       loss of over �5 million although the figure in the sentencing remarks
       is �3,000,143,000.  Count 2, the conspiracy, the charge is losses  in
       excess of �2 million to which Kareem and Fafore pleaded  guilty.  The
       Judge accepted  that  the  maximum  figures  are  not  those  of  the
       defendants before him but that they did show the nature,  extent  and
       sophistication of the conspiracies to which they were parties. Kareem
       is said to have had 2,660 debit cards, 1,552  bank  accounts  and  15
       bogus web-pages. Specifically in relation  to  Mr  Kareem  the  Judge
       stated:


           So far as Mister Kareem is concerned, there are credits of  some
           �61,650 into various bank accounts of his and I point out in his
           case there are a large number of bank accounts.


           It is also significant is that he set up an account with Liberty
           Reserve. This is an Internet bank based in Costa  Rica  and  the
           statement from DS Harvey establishes and explains how  difficult
           it is to obtain any information from those  accounts.  It  shows
           two  things;  firstly,  the  degree  of   sophistication;   and,
           secondly, the knowledge that the use of such  an  account  makes
           investigation at very best very difficult.


    9. The Sentencing Judge notes the impact upon the victims  by  reference
       to two named individuals. One, a Mrs Finch, had �3,500  removed  from
       her account. In her statement she said the following: "The money that
       was taken out meant that we had nothing in our bank accounts  as  our
       savings had been stolen. I first noticed this when I went in May 2008
       to go to the shops to do some shopping. I went to get money from  the
       cash-point. There was only �3.00 there when there  should  have  been
       �3,500. At the time I felt devastated and shocked as I knew it wasn't
       me and knew it wasn't my husband. I started crying in the  middle  of
       Halifax and felt helpless. I could not pay for or buy  anything  that
       day. I told my husband. We went to the  bank  almost  every  day  for
       about a week. We had to prove that the money had been stolen and that
       we hadn't taken it. I  felt  like  we  had  to  prove  that  we  were
       innocent.


       However, that wasn't the end of the damage. We were left with nothing
       basically in that week. We could not buy  basic  essentials  such  as
       food. We couldn't pay any bills and we had to ring various  companies
       that we owed money to, to let them know  what  was  happening.  There
       were difficulties with council tax and every night  during  the  week
       our money was missing I had sleepless nights. I did not sleep for all
       of that week, especially my husband. This was absolutely  emotionally
       draining. I felt angered and had a lot of other emotions that I  went
       through. I was upset and it was hard to function that week. We had to
       borrow money from people, our family members, to do our shopping."


   10. In relation to a Mr Martin who had �219,000 removed from his account,
       he stated in his impact statement that the money was saved to pay for
       building works and to pay contractors which was money that  had  been
       drawn from his business. He refers to the impact  upon  him  and  his
       family.


   11. In relation to the actual sentencing exercise the Judge records  that
       the conspiracy, of which Fafore and Kareem were part, was  fraudulent
       from the outset and professionally planned. It was  carried  on  over
       the significant period of time involving multiple frauds. Numbers  of
       people were involved and it had a significant impact on the  victims.
       In relation to the defendant in this appeal,  Mr  Kareem,  the  Judge
       made the following observations:


           "Kareem, you pleaded guilty on the day of the trial and I see no
           reason whatsoever to reduce your sentence by more than  the  ten
           percent.


           I  consider  that  from   an   examination   of   e-mails,   the
           documentation that I     have read  and  been  referred  to  and
           everything that I know about this case and have  heard  that  as
           between you, Fafore, and you,  Kareem,  you,  Fafore,  the  more
           responsible but not to a very large extent".


   12. The Judge also refers to the Crown proceeding under section 6 of  the
       Proceeds of Crime Act.



Discussion


   13. I find the Panel were fully aware of the nature of the evidence  made
       available to them together with the composition of this family  unit.
       They note in particular that the Appellant has a family and when  the
       Panel state at paragraph 100 that they  have  carefully  taking  into
       account all the evidence presented  it  is  clear  from  reading  the
       determination that this reflects what the Panel did rather than being
       a standardised paragraph with no foundation.


   14. The decision was made by the First-tier Tribunal prior  to  the  28th
       July  2014  and  therefore  the  provisions  of  section  19  of  the
       Immigration Act 2014 were not applicable.


   15. Since paragraph 364 was deleted from the Immigration Rules  for  post
       July 2012 applications, the rules simply assert at paragraph 397 that
       a deport order will not be made if it would be contrary to  the  UK's
       obligations under the Refugee  Convention  or  the  ECHR  or  if  not
       contrary  to  those   obligations   in   exceptional   circumstances.
       Paragraphs 398, 399  and  399A  then  set  out  the  requirements  to
       consider when assessing the Article 8 position. This is the  approach
       taken by the Panel and no misdirection of law is established.


   16. There have been a number of cases providing guidance in  the  correct
       approach to be followed in law when considering appeals such as this.


   17. In MF (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  the  Master  of  the  Rolls
       indicated that where the "new rules" (in  force  from  9  July  2012)
       apply (in a deportation  case),  the  "first  step  that  has  to  be
       undertaken is to decide whether deportation would be contrary  to  an
       individual's article 8 rights on the grounds that (i) the case  falls
       within para 398 (b) or (c) and (ii) one or more of the conditions set
       out in para 399 (a) or (b) or para 399A (a) or (b) applies.   If  the
       case falls within para 398 (b) or  (c)  and  one  or  more  of  those
       conditions applies,  then  the  new  rules  implicitly  provide  that
       deportation would be contrary to article 8".  Paragraphs 399 and 399A
       can be thought of as setting out the exceptions to  deportation  (see
       paragraph 14).  In MF (Nigeria) the main issue concerned the position
       when the appellant could not succeed substantively  under  paragraphs
       398 or 399 of the  rules  on  a  deportation  and  the  determinative
       question is whether there are "exceptional circumstances"  such  that
       the public interest in deportation is  outweighed  by  other  factors
       (paragraph 398  of  the  new  rules).   Here  the  Court  accepted  a
       submission  for  the  SSHD  that  "the   reference   to   exceptional
       circumstances  serves  the  purpose  of  emphasising  that,  in   the
       balancing exercise, great  weight  should  be  given  to  the  public
       interest in deporting foreign criminals who do not satisfy paras  398
       and 399 or  399A.    It  is  only  exceptionally  that  such  foreign
       criminals will succeed in showing that  their  rights  under  article
       8(1) trump the public interest in their deportation"  (paragraphs  39
       and 40).  The Court went on to say: "In our view, [this]  is  not  to
       say that a test of exceptionality is being  applied.   Rather  it  is
       that,  in  approaching  the  question  of  whether   removal   is   a
       proportionate interference with an individual's article 8 rights, the
       scales are heavily weighted in favour of  deportation  and  something
       very compelling (which will be "exceptional") is required to outweigh
       the public interest in removal" (paragraph 42).  Although  the  Court
       disagreed with the Upper Tribunal in MF's case  on  the  question  of
       form, it did not disagree in substance (paragraphs 44  and  50).   It
       differed from the Upper Tribunal in considering that  the  rules  did
       mandate or direct a decision maker to take all relevant criteria into
       account (paragraph 44).  Accordingly, the  new  rules  applicable  to
       deportation cases  should  be  seen  as  "a  complete  code  ...  the
       exceptional circumstances to be considered in the balancing  exercise
       involve the application of a proportionality test as required by  the
       Strasbourg jurisprudence" (ibid).   "Even  if  we  were  wrong  about
       that, it would be necessary to apply a proportionality  test  outside
       the new rules as was done by the Upper Tribunal.    Either  way,  the
       result should be the same". What the Court said  about  the  test  of
       "insurmountable obstacles" can be seen as obiter but it did say  that
       if  that  means  "literally  obstacles  which  it  is  impossible  to
       surmount, their scope is  very  limited  indeed.   We  shall  confine
       ourselves to saying that we incline to the view that, for the reasons
       stated in detail by the Upper Tribunal in Izuazu [2013] UKUT 00045 at
       paras 53 to 59, such  a  stringent  approach  would  be  contrary  to
       article 8". MF (Nigeria) was effectively followed in Kabia (MF:  para
       298 - "exceptional circumstances") 2013 UKUT 00569 (IAC) in which  it
       was said that exceptionality is a likely characteristic  of  a  claim
       that properly succeeds rather than a legal test to be met.   In  this
       context, "exceptional" means circumstances in which deportation would
       result in unjustifiably harsh  consequences  for  the  individual  or
       their family such that a deportation would not be proportionate".  In
       YM (Uganda) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 1292 it  was  confirmed  that  the
       2012 Rules were a complete code for  dealing  with  a  person  facing
       deportation  under  the  Immigration  Acts,  and  who  claimed   that
       deportation was contrary to his Article 8 rights. In MM(Lebanon)  and
       others [2014] EWCA Civ 985 it was said that 'where the relevant group
       of IRs, upon their proper construction, provide a "complete code" for
       dealing with a  person's  Convention  rights  in  the  context  of  a
       particular Immigration Rule or statutory provision, such  as  in  the
       case of "foreign criminals", then the balancing exercise and the  way
       the various factors are to be taken into  account  in  an  individual
       case must be done in accordance with that code,  although  references
       to "exceptional circumstances" in the code will nonetheless entail  a
       proportionality exercise. But if the relevant group  of  IRs  is  not
       such a "complete code" then the proportionality test will be more  at
       large, albeit guided by the Huang tests and UK  and  Strasbourg  case
       law. In SSHD v AJ (Angola) and AJ (Gambia [2014] EWCA Civ 1636 it was
       held that two Upper Tribunal  decisions  which  reversed  deportation
       orders issued to two foreign criminals contained material  errors  of
       law  and  were  remitted  for  reconsideration.  The  tribunals   had
       considered the offenders' rights under Article 8 of  the  ECHR  as  a
       free-standing issue separate from the  Immigration  Rules  when  they
       ought instead to have applied the comprehensive code incorporated  in
       the "new rules", issued under the 2012 amendment to  the  Immigration
       Rules. The Court explained  the  importance  of  taking  the  correct
       approach to the new rules.


   18. In HA (Iraq) v SSHD [2014] EWCA 1304 the Upper Tribunal was  held  to
       have erred in allowing an appeal against a 2010  decision  to  deport
       the appellant to  Iraq  on  article  8  grounds  without  considering
       paragraphs 398 and 399 which post dated the  decision.  It  was  said
       that MF (Nigeria) made it clear that the  new  Rules  told  decision-
       makers what weight  they  should  give  to  the  public  interest  in
       deporting foreign criminals. In the  light  of  the  new  Immigration
       Rules and the 2007 Act, the Upper Tribunal was obliged  to  recognise
       the weight which the  2007  Act  attributed  to  the  deportation  of
       foreign criminals and to recognise that the Rules made it clear  that
       great weight should be given to the public interest. The  combination
       of factors that the Upper Tribunal found to be  'compelling'  in  the
       Claimant's case, namely his  length  of  stay  in  the  UK,  positive
       attitude to future behaviour and the considerable effect that removal
       would have on him and his partner did not engage  with  the  need  to
       identify 'very compelling' countervailing  factors  or  the  need  to
       engage a 'very strong claim indeed'.


   19. In LC (China) [2014] EWCA Civ 1319 it  was  held  that  the  starting
       point for any such assessment was the  recognition  that  the  public
       interest in deporting a foreign criminal was so great  that  only  in
       exceptional circumstances would it be outweighed  by  other  factors,
       including the effect of  deportation  on  any  children.  In  McLarty
       (Deportation- balance) [2014] UKUT 00315 it was held that  there  can
       be little doubt that in enacting the UK Borders Act  2007  Parliament
       views the object of deporting those with a criminal record as a  very
       strong policy, which is constant in all cases (SS  (Nigeria)  v  SSHD
       [2013] EWCA Civ 550).  The weight to be attached to that object will,
       however, include a variable component, which reflects the criminality
       in issue.  Nevertheless, Parliament has tilted the scales strongly in
       favour of deportation and for them to return to the  level  and  then
       swing in favour of a criminal  opposing  deportation  there  must  be
       compelling reasons, which must be exceptional; (ii) What  amounts  to
       compelling reasons or exceptional circumstances  is  very  much  fact
       dependent but  must  necessarily  be  seen  in  the  context  of  the
       articulated will of Parliament in favour of deportation; (iii)  Where
       the facts surrounding an individual who has  committed  a  crime  are
       said to be "exceptional" or "compelling", these  are  factors  to  be
       placed in the weighing scale, in order  to  be  weighed  against  the
       public  interest;  (iv)  In  some   other   instances,   the   phrase
       "exceptional" or "compelling" has  been  used  to  describe  the  end
       result: namely, that the position of the individual is  "exceptional"
       or "compelling" because, having weighed the unusual facts against the
       (powerful) public interest, the former outweighs the latter.  In this
       sense  "exceptional"  or  "compelling"  is  the  end  result  of  the
       proportionality weighing process.


   20. It is not suggested the  Appellant  is  able  to  succeed  under  the
       Immigration Rules and the Panel were therefore required  to  identify
       the existence of exceptional  circumstances  sufficient  to  tip  the
       balance in the Appellants favour if they were to  allow  the  appeal.
       They found no such circumstances had been shown to exist.


   21. The determination is challenged on four grounds.  The  first  alleges
       the Panel failed to adequately consider Beoku-Betts  and  section  55
       and failed to take into account in particular the Independent  Social
       Workers  report  and  failed  to  provide  a  sufficiently   reasoned
       explanation for material findings.


   22. It was submitted by Mr Chrico that this error was material unless the
       decision could only be made in the way the  Panel  had  and  that  it
       would be perverse to allow this matter to stand. He submitted  it  is
       not possible to know what  findings  the  Panel  made  regarding  the
       children that the findings made did not consider  all  the  available
       evidence. The family members include a wife and two children and  the
       Appellant's case was supported by a report from the social worker  in
       relation to the impact of deportation upon the family.


   23. The social workers report is dated the 3rd January 2014 and sets  out
       the composition of the family and the  discussions  and  observations
       made  in  relation  to  the  preparation  of   that   document.   The
       consequences of the Appellant's deportation  to  Nigeria  formed  the
       core element of the discussions with the Appellant's wife  who  is  a
       qualified solicitor working in the United Kingdom.


   24. There are two children of the family, IK born in 2006 and AMK born in
       2009.


   25.  Under  the  heading  "the  effect  deportation  would  have  on  the
       appellant's wife's ability to  care  for  the  children"  the  social
       workers states:


        5 (ii)     Joy Diali was very clear  that  following  her  husband's
             arrest and imprisonment she found it increasingly difficult to
             cope on her own with the  children  without  him.  Indeed,  by
             September 2012 she was not coping, and this was despite having
             been given a time when  she  thought  her  husband  was  being
             released (December 2012) although this was proved  not  to  be
             the case as he  was  then  further  detained  for  immigration
             purposes. In September 2012 Joy  Diali  wrote  to  the  prison
             authorities to plead for her husband to be made a  category  D
             prisoner (so that she could  see  him  more  with  a  view  to
             getting support from him, spending more time with him), and in
             that letter told the authorities how desperate  she  felt  she
             could not  manage,  and  that  she  had  episodes  of  feeling
             suicidal because of her situation.


       5(ii).2.    Asked in what ways she was not coping, Joy Diali told  me
             that it was the emotional  anguish  she  was  feeling  at  not
             having her husband living with her which was so consuming that
             it impacted on the attention she was able to give her job, and
             on the quality of care she  was  able  to  give  the  children
             because  she  had  her  high-pressure  work  as  a   solicitor
             specialising in mental health, with  irregular  working  hours
             and sometimes evening work, and to meet the total  care  needs
             of the children.


       5(ii).3.    Prior to his arrest and imprisonment, Ayodeji Kareem  had
             been responsible for the children's care, as  he  is  now,  to
             relieve his wife of the everyday tasks of looking  after  them
             while she worked. Then having that responsibility     when  he
             was no longer around was a sudden and considerable  burden  to
             her, both practically and emotionally and she  struggled  with
             it, and even now feels guilty that she  did  not  fulfil  this
             expectation of her in a manner that best suited to  children's
             needs.


       5(ii).4.    The greatest problem in relation to the children  was  in
             organising their  daily  childcare  for  taking  them  to  and
             collecting them from school, (with  someone  caring  for  them
             until  their  mother  of  returned  from  work),   and   being
             emotionally available for  them  both  as  they  too  (but  IK
             particularly) was suffering from the loss of their father  and
             their changed circumstances. Additionally Joy Diali had to fit
             in all the practical tasks such as the children's washing  and
             food preparation, and other household tasks.


       5 (ii).5.   Referring to her childcare arrangements, Joy  Diali  told
             me that finding  someone  upon  whom  she  could  rely  was  a
             significant difficulty and when I asked  about  the  relatives
             that have written letters of support to the Home Office  about
             her husband Joy Diali responded 'I do have a good family  with
             my relatives,  and  the  children  did  go  to  relatives  the
             holidays (because their own children were also on holiday) but
             I could not use them every day (in term time) because they all
             work too and they all have busy family lives, so I would  only
             turn to them if I had to'. Joy Diali realised  she  could  not
             regularly impose on them for  childcare  arrangements  because
             she is very familiar with their lifestyles and the  extent  of
             their family activities. She added that she  also  'wanted  to
             keep the family together', implying that she did not  want  to
             be so demanding of  a  busy  family  members  that  they  felt
             burdened and  possibly  resentful  so  it  impacted  on  their
             relationship.


   26. The report examines the question whether Joy Diali would give up  her
       work if her  husband  is  deported  in  relation  to  which  she  has
       considered both options and the impact of the situation upon her.  It
       is recorded at 5(ii).14. that "there must be a real anxiety  that  if
       the appellant is deported Joy Diali will become more depressed or low
       in mood than previously as a consequence of  the  loss  of  him,  the
       demands on her as the sole carer of the children, and  the  pressures
       of being in work or reliant on benefits which she is unlikely  to  be
       able  to  conceal  from  the  children  and  which  could  result  in
       repercussions upon them. It is also stated that her moods may  impact
       upon the mood the children and that children are more vulnerable when
       living with a lone  parent  who  also  suffers  from  mental  illness
       because when the parent is  experiencing  difficulties  there  is  no
       other adult living in the home to take the parenting role.


   27. In relation to the effect on the children the social worker sets  out
       the findings at section 5 (iii) pages 21 to 30 of report. It is  said
       the children have a strong close and affectionate  relationship  with
       their father and that the children are likely to be  very  distressed
       at their father's sudden and permanent disappearance with a sense  of
       loss which will be considerable and as a  bereavement  because  their
       relationship will with him will have suddenly ended. It  is  said  no
       meaningful  relationship  can  be  maintained  indirectly   as   such
       relationships  involve   physical   contact,   care   and   attentive
       interaction to enable the children to develop.


   28. At paragraph 5 (iii).8. The social worker states that if their father
       is removed again, and  this  time  permanently  (and  it  has  to  be
       remembered that previously the children and their mother  reacted  as
       they did despite believing  that  separation  was  time-limited)  and
       their  mothers   mood   deteriorates   again,   the   emotional   and
       psychological impact on the children is likely  to  be  considerable,
       leaving them extremely vulnerable to the problems that research  into
       the lives of children who live  without  their  fathers  referred  to
       above has identified.


   29. In relation to the question whether it is in the  best  interests  of
       the children for their father to remain in the  United  Kingdom,  the
       social worker makes the following observations:


       5 (iv).1.   It is in the best interests of  [I]  and  [M]  for  their
             developmental needs to be met and  [I]  and  [M,]  aged  seven
             years and four years respectively, have the same developmental
             needs for all children of their ages for  emotional  stability
             and security, positive, and affectionate and consistent  child
             focused care with guidelines for their behaviour,  stimulation
             and  encouragement  with  their  schoolwork  to  reach   their
             potential, the opportunity  to  socialise  and  develop  their
             social skills, and adequate housing, food, clothing and access
             to medical care.


       5 (iv).2.   [I] and [M] have a close, loving relationship  with  both
             their parents and when their father is in the family with them
             they understand that as their mother has a job to  earn  money
             for the family that demands the time for lengthy parts of each
             day, their father cares for them as  their  primary  carer  by
             taking them to and from school, playing and  interacting  with
             them, encouraging them with their homework  and  listening  to
             them read.  Ayodeji Kareem has been caring for  both  children
             since they were young babies up until the  time  that  he  was
             arrested in August 2010, and again since he has been  released
             on bail in May 2013. The routine and consistent nature of  the
             children's care when living with their father and their mother
              (Joy Diali has shared the parenting task with her husband  at
             weekends, and during the week after work when  she  is  able),
             will have been a significant factor in  helping  the  children
             develop  the  important  sense  of  stability  and   security,
             although it has to be acknowledged that  their  experience  of
             family life will have been greatly enhanced  by  the  improved
             relationship between their parents that has been a consequence
             of Ayodeij Kareem's imprisonment, and a greater  understanding
             and awareness he has gained through the  relevant  courses  he
             voluntarily undertook .


       5 (iv).3.   If Ayodeij Kareem is deported and Joy Diali becomes  sole
             carer of the children, from her own account and based  on  her
             sense of desperation and despair when  trying  to  cope  as  a
             single, working mother, she will  struggle  again  when  she's
             working or she gives up her job and relies on benefits, and in
             light of the fact there will be no endpoint this time  to  her
             changed circumstances as there was previously, and she will be
             suffering the grief of her husband's permanent removal,  there
             is a considerable risk that her mental health will deteriorate
             which will further impact upon her  ability  to  cope  and  to
             care.  [I] particularly, but also [M]  are  likely  to  suffer
             adversely in this situation, and while the children do have  a
             large number of extended family members,  despite  their  best
             intentions, none have shown that they have the time  available
             to  consistently  commit   themselves   to   practically   and
             emotionally supporting the children, nor that  they  have  the
             full understanding of [I] or [M's] psychological and emotional
             needs in this situation and how they can best be helped


       5 (iv).4.   If [I] and [M] are to emotionally flourish and experience
             the stability and emotional security that they need, it  would
             be in their best interests  if  their  father  is  allowed  to
             remain with his family in this country. If he is  able  to  do
             that, it is his and his wife's plan that he continues to  have
             much of the responsibility for the children as  that  relieves
             his wife of providing it. If it is that he can get  work  with
             hours that suit this role, and this is likely to be  in  night
             work,  he  will  accept  it  as   any   additional   financial
             contribution to the household will help to  clear  the  family
             debts  more  quickly.  His  financial  contribution   is   not
             essential for the couple to clear their debts, it  just  means
             that it will take longer if they are  solely  reliant  on  Joy
             Diali's income, but what would be enormously difficult for Joy
             Diali would be if she cannot rely on her husband's support for
             childcare and has to return  to  paying  others  to  mind  the
             children  while  she  works.  Such  payments   created   debts
             themselves in the past, and even if  this  was  not  the  case
             again (which it is likely to be) such payments would seriously
             reduce what she has available from paying their  rent  arrears
             and care lone and the housing department at  least,  this  may
             lead to threats about her continuing tendency.


       5 (iv).5.   Clearly [I] and [M] will  not  experience  the  essential
             sense of stability and security that their father remaining in
             the family could give them, if he becomes involved in  further
             criminal activity and there is  further  imprisonment  and  it
             could be thought that if he and his wife have financial  debts
             there might be a temptation for Ayodeji Kareem to resume  that
             lifestyle to pay  debts.   However,  his  return  to  criminal
             activity has been assessed as being a 'low risk'(Oasys  report
             dated 19.3.2013, esp. pages 53, 56, 57,  58).  Significant  in
             this assessment has been a greater understanding and awareness
             Ayodeji Kareem has gained from the different  courses  he  has
             undertaken and from serving  and  learning  of  his  wife  and
             children's  suffering  without  him.  He  now  recognises  the
             significant impact his behaviour has on others  and,  relevant
             to this report, his family in particular and he is shamed  and
             saddened by it and is confident that it will not be  repeated.
             Importantly, he also now accepts that even in caring  for  the
             children and supporting his wife without earning money, he  is
             meaningfully contributing to the family's  functioning,  which
             contrasts  with  his  previously  held  cultural  belief  that
             husbands and fathers should and can only be, the providers for
             their  families,  a  view   that   contributed   towards   his
             involvement in criminal activity at that time.


       5 (iv).6.   If Ayodeji Kareem is allowed to remain with his wife  and
             children, and continue in his current role, there is  research
             into the influence of father involvement in child  development
             outcomes that shows that infants of  highly  involved  fathers
             are better  problem  solvers  as  toddlers  (Easterbrooks  and
             Goldberg 1984) and have higher IQ's by age 3 (Yogman,  Kindlan
             and Earls 1995) and  both  [I]  and  [M]  had  their  father's
             support and encouragement being as he was at that time as now,
             highly involved as their primary carer.


       5 (iv).7.   Research also demonstrates that school  age  children  of
             involved fathers are better academic achievers. They are  more
             likely to get high grades, have better quantitative and verbal
             skills (Bing 1963, Goldstein, 1982), have higher  grade  point
             averages or perform a year above their expected age  level  on
             academic tests (Astone & Maclanahan 1991; Blanchard  &  Biller
             1971; Cooksey & Fondell 1996). They are also  more  likely  to
             enjoy  school,   have   better   attitudes   towards   school,
             participate in extra curricular activities and graduate.  They
             are also less likely to fail a grade, have poor attendance, or
             have behavioural problems at school (Astone and Lanahan  1991,
             Brown and Rife 1991).  Ayodeji Kareem is supportive of [I] and
             [M's] education and he is wanting  both  of  his  children  to
             ultimately achieve their academic potential but is aware  that
             they need to experience parental support and enthusiasm to  do
             this.


       5 (iv).8.   There is an argument that acknowledges that there can  be
             a negative impact on a child's  educational  attainment  as  a
             consequence of their father's removal, but insists  that  when
             weighed against the need to remove the father, the  latter  is
             more important. However, where the father is very involved  in
             his children's care and the children are aware of this support
             and are emotionally fulfilled by it such that they have better
             self-esteem  and  motivation,  the  educational  as  well   as
             emotional and psychological impact of losing this relationship
             can be a life long. I would observe from my  own  professional
             experience that there can  therefore  be  a  very  significant
             cumulative impact on society in having to  provide  emotional,
             psychological and educational support that  is  likely  to  be
             unnecessary if the relationship is not lost but is allowed  to
             continue to grow and develop.


       5 (iv).9.   Indeed, research on the emotional development  and  well-
             being of children whose fathers are actively involved in their
             care show that father's involvement is  positively  correlated
             with children experiencing  overall  life  satisfaction,  less
             depression ( Field et al 1995), a greater tolerance of  stress
             and frustration (Micshel, Shod and Peake 1988), have  superior
             problem-solving and adaptive skills  (Biller  1993),  and  are
             better able to  manage  their  emotions  and  impulses  in  an
             adaptive manner (Easterbrooks and Goldberg 1990), and  display
             less impulsivity  or  loss  of  control  (Micshal  1961).   If
             Ayodeji Kareem was able to remain in this country and continue
             to be an actively involved and supportive parent as he  is  at
             present,  his  children  will  benefit  both  emotionally  and
             psychologically.


   30. The social worker also  considered  what  were  deemed  to  be  other
       relevant matter to the issue of separation of the father and child in
       section 5 (v) which is said to be the issue of the family  relocating
       to Nigeria and the social worker being told by  Joy  Diali  that  she
       could not accompany her husband and that neither she nor her  husband
       want the children to have to grow up in Nigeria.


   31. The fact the determination does not set out the social workers report
       in the same detail as above is not in itself a  material  error.  The
       First-tier Tribunal Panel noted and found there  was  a  strong  bond
       between family members and that the Appellant's wife and two children
       are British citizens. The Appellant's wife's profession is  noted  as
       is the children's schooling in the United Kingdom.  It  is  noted  in
       paragraph 110 that in the usual course of life it will be  preferable
       for the children to continue their  lives  in  this  country  in  the
       company of their father and mother  in  accordance  with  their  best
       interests. This finding is in accordance  with  the  opinion  of  the
       social worker.


   32. In paragraph 111 the Panel acknowledge all the  reports  relating  to
       the Appellant and matters set out in the skeleton argument  including
       progress made by the Appellant in prison although  then  specifically
       state "Whilst those factors are all to the good, we here consider the
       nature of the offences and the seriousness thereof as  being  by  far
       the most significant to be weighed in our deliberations".


   33.  The  Panel  find  that  no  exceptional  circumstances   have   been
       established on the balance of probabilities and therefore  find  that
       the decision is lawfully, the breach of article 8 proportionate,  and
       accordingly that the appeal shall be dismissed. In doing so they find
       the children's best interests are to remain within  the  family  unit
       having taken the evidence from all sources into  account.  The  Panel
       have not misdirected themselves in law in relation  to  the  children
       and an assertion they have erred in relation to  section  55  has  no
       arguable merit. A reading of the determination does  not  shown  that
       best interest of the children have not been  given  the  considerably
       weight they require.


   34. The Panel also note the impact upon the Appellant's  wife  if  he  is
       deported, according to her own account given in her evidence  and  as
       reported to the social worker, but this is not a  determinate  factor
       and either are the best interests of the children. They are  part  of
       the balancing exercise.  The  Appellant's  wife  may  have  found  it
       difficult  to  cope  with  the  children  as  well  as  pursuing  her
       profession but the evidence does not established  that  that  is  the
       only option available to her or that if the Appellant is deported and
       there is a down turn in her moods,  this  will  lead  to  an  adverse
       impact  upon  the   children   such   as   to   make   the   decision
       disproportionate. The Appellant's wife recognises that she  may  have
       to make a choice regarding her family or her work or  to  juggle  the
       two. If she chose not to give up her work she will have to make other
       arrangements as many thousands of working mothers do  in  the  United
       Kingdom to ensure a routine is established that meets the  children's
       needs. The  Appellant's  wife  did  write  to  the  prison  and  copy
       correspondence is in the bundle to this  effect.   It  is  noted  the
       authorities recommended that professional help may be available.   If
       difficulties arise it has not been show  on  the  evidence  that  the
       family remaining in the UK will not be  able  to  obtain  appropriate
       help or support if required. The statement by  the  Appellant's  wife
       and the social worker that she may be of low mood  with  consequences
       is unsupported by any evidence  of  a  psychological  or  psychiatric
       nature from an expert physician in this field. Even if it is accepted
       that the emotional impact upon the  Appellant's  wife  following  his
       deportation could cause her to be of low mood, most people experience
       ups and downs  in  their  life,  and  can  feel  unhappy,  depressed,
       stressed or anxious during difficult times which is a normal part  of
       life. It was not suggested that she would not be able to obtain  help
       through the  NHS  including  necessary  prescriptions  to  help  with
       anxiety and or depression which would not prevent her from continuing
       to function as many do in a similar situation.


   35. It is accepted there may be an adverse impact upon the  children  who
       will be upset at the loss of their father with whom  they  are  close
       but again there is no expert evidence from  a  child  or  educational
       psychologist to show  that  the  impact  will  be  such  to  tip  the
       balancing  exercise  in  their   favour.   No   unjustifiably   harsh
       consequences have been made out  even  allowing  for  the  upset  and
       distress that may arise on deportation and  the  fact  they  may  not
       realise their full potential.  The  evidence  fails  to  address  the
       availability of statutory services to which the Appellants  wife  and
       children  as  British  citizens   are   entitled   to   address   any
       psychological consequences and to help the children re-adjust to  the
       life without their father. The comment that other family members  are
       not aware of the actual needs of the children may be true, but it  is
       not clear that anyone has taken the time to explain these to them  in
       detail and properly assess any assistance they are able to give.  The
       comment by the social worker that "there  can  therefore  be  a  very
       significant  cumulative  impact  on  society  in  having  to  provide
       emotional, psychological and educational support that is likely to be
       unnecessary if the  relationship  is  not  lost  but  is  allowed  to
       continue to grow and develop" acknowledges that such  services  exist
       and are available.


   36. I have also considered the material afresh to ascertain  whether  the
       Panel erred in finding as they did that the impact  upon  the  family
       did not make the decision disproportionate. This is  not  a  case  in
       which the only rational outcome is that the appeal should  have  been
       allowed as Mr Chirio infers, far from it. It is recognised  that  the
       consequence of deportation can be that a family is  separated.   This
       family face such an impact  as  the  Appellants  wife  has  said  she
       intends to remain in the UK with the children even though it has  not
       been established that the children will not be  able  to  adjust  and
       adapt with their parents support if the family return to Nigeria as a
       unit. All the points made by the social worker regarding  the  effect
       of a family being together must apply if  the  family  relocate  too.
       The conclusion that best  interests  of  the  children  are  not  the
       determinative factor, and neither is the impact upon  the  Appellants
       wife, has not been shown to be a decision  outside  those  the  Panel
       were permitted to make on the evidence.


   37. I find the Appellant has failed to substantiate his  claim  that  the
       Panel made a material legal error in the way in which this aspect  of
       the case was considered. I also find the conclusions to be adequately
       reasoned.


   38. Ground 2 asserts the Panel erred in  failing  to  take  into  account
       material evidence when concluding the Appellant had no remorse to the
       victims  and  society,  alternatively  they  failed  to   provide   a
       sufficiently reasoned explanation for a material finding.


   39. In paragraph 104 the Panel found:


           104.   We detail above certain  specific  issues  addressed  and
           referred  to  by  the  sentencing  judge  because  we  find,  in
           assessing matters of proportionality, that the  seriousness  and
           significance of the crime committed by the Appellant is a matter
           to which we give considerable weight.  The Appellant is  clearly
           skilled in information technology and generally in  the  use  of
           computers.  During the evidence we heard that the computer  used
           to undertake these crimes was in the living room of  the  family
           home.  However from that computer the Appellant clearly  wreaked
           havoc upon the lives of many individuals,  including  those  who
           were simply not  in  a  position  to  afford  even  a  temporary
           diminution of their savings.  It is utterly clear to us that the
           Appellant had no thought  whatsoever  at  the  time     for  his
           victims, of whom there were many.


   40. This paragraph was mentioned in the original refusal of permission to
       appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  The Appellant admitted he did not give
       any thought to his victims at the time he committed the offences.  Of
       more relevance is paragraph 108 in which the Panel find:


           108.   We entirely accept that there are  strong  bonds  between
           family members. However this leads, on the basis of the evidence
           heard from the Appellant and all family members, to our  finding
           that the Appellant appears to have  greater  concern  about  the
           effect on his family of the sentence which he  underwent  rather
           than the concern for the victims and in  particular  remorse  to
           society generally.  From the evidence we heard we  do  not  find
           that the Appellant genuinely has remorse towards the victims  or
           to society.  We find that he is overwhelmingly concerned that he
           damaged his relations with other family members.


   41. The Panel heard the evidence  and  record  in  this  paragraph  their
       opinion of that evidence in relation to an issue they were  asked  to
       consider.  The grounds assert legal error in that the Pane failed  to
       state why they attached no  weight  to  the  evidence  given  by  the
       Appellant that he did express remorse and has undertaken  courses  in
       prison focussing on victim issues.


   42. It may be the case the Appellant  expressed  remorse  as  stated  and
       undertook courses but this is not determinative. The Panel considered
       the evidence with the required degree of anxious  scrutiny  and  have
       given adequate reasons for the findings they  made  which  are  based
       upon the evidence they heard. As such the weigh to be  attributed  to
       that evidence was  matter  for  the  Panel.  They  do  not  find  the
       Appellant has not stated he shows remorse. The  specific  finding  is
       that they do not find he genuinely (my emphasis) has remorse  towards
       the victims or to society and that the focus of his concerns is  that
       he damaged his relations with other family members. It has  not  been
       shown this is an irrational conclusion on the basis of the  evidence.
       No legal error is made out.


   43. Ground 3 asserts the Panel  failed  to  take  into  account  material
       evidence when considering the benefit received by the Appellant  from
       the proceeds of his crime, alternatively, the Panel  drew  inferences
       from the evidence they were not entitled to draw, alternatively  they
       failed to provide a sufficiently reasoned explanation for a  material
       finding.  It is asserted the finding of the Panel that the  Appellant
       had benefitted more than could be found  and  confiscated  is  to  go
       behind the findings of the Crown Court who it is said addressed these
       matters during to confiscation  proceedings.  It  is  also  said  the
       finding ignored a number of submissions made that are set out in  the
       Grounds.


   44. The Panel addressed this matter  in  paragraphs  106-107  where  they
       state:


           106.   We have referred to the amount which the sentencing judge
           found had been transferred to the Appellant. This was in  excess
           of �60,000.  The Appellant in his evidence before us referred to
           having benefitted from his   criminal activities to the  limited
           extent of �10,000 or �20,000.  From which ever sum, he  said  he
           had given probably only �1,000 to his wife towards the needs  of
           the  family.  No  explanation  given  by  the  Appellant   could
           establish why the stated lower sum he had received was different
           from the funds which the  sentencing  judge  clearly  found  the
           Appellant had received  through  his  criminal  activities  into
           accounts which were in his name.


           107.   We find the Appellant has not  been  truthful  about  the
           amount of money from which he benefitted.  We do not accept  the
           contention that if he received more the family would not  be  in
           debt.  Indeed, perhaps there is evidence of  the  priorities  of
           the Appellant  and  his  family.   In  that  we  note  that  the
           Appellant's wife has repaid �900 to the brother of the Appellant
           from the costs  of  a  family  holiday  to  Nigeria  whilst  the
           Appellant was in prison. However there were significant rent and
           council tax arrears which accrued and which  are  sums  owed  to
           Southwark MBC.


   45. The submissions recorded in the grounds  fail  to  address  the  core
       finding of the Panel which is that the Appellant  has  not  told  the
       truth in relation to the sums he received from the crime. No evidence
       of a judicial finding has  been  provided  which  creates  a  binding
       precedent upon the Panel. The Panel considered the Sentencing  Judges
       remarks, the claims made by the Appellant in his evidence, and having
       done  so  reached  conclusions  which  have  not  been  shown  to  be
       irrational when all the available evidence is considered.


   46. The automatic deportation  order  also  arose  as  a  result  of  the
       conviction, not the  amount  gained  from  the  same.  There  may  be
       differing figures available to  the  Courts  at  different  times  in
       different proceedings.   There  is  nothing  perverse  in  the  Panel
       considering the Sentencing Judges remarks in relation to the  amounts
       shown to  be  transferred  to  the  Appellant  and  then  noting  the
       substantial discrepancy in the Appellants own evidence in relation to
       the same matter.


   47. It has not been shown that the findings made  by  the  Panel  on  the
       material available to them fall outside those there were entitled  to
       make, or will make a material difference to the overall conclusion of
       the Panel in dismissing the appeal.


   48. As stated, the Panel considered the material available to  them  with
       the required degree of anxious scrutiny even though it is not set out
       in detail. In relation to the question of whether they gave  adequate
       reasons, a reader of the determination  can  clearly  understand  why
       they came to the conclusion they did. The  Panel  clearly  considered
       the relevant legal provisions and found that even if everything  that
       had been advanced on the Appellant's behalf is put on one side of the
       scale, including the effect on his  wife  and  children,  the  weight
       given to the Secretary of State's case in light of the serious nature
       of  the  offending,  the  sentence  imposed,  the  appropriate  legal
       provisions, and deterrent element which is a strong  factor  in  this
       case, tipped those scales in favour of the Secretary  of  State.  The
       finding that on the evidence it had been shown to  be  decision  that
       was proportionate (Article 8 (2)) is the key finding. That conclusion
       is within the range of findings the Panel are entitled to make on the
       available evidence and it has not been shown  that  any  legal  error
       material to that decision has  been  made.  Mere  disagreement  or  a
       desire for a different outcome  does  not  establish  arguable  legal
       error. A desire for greater weight to be attributed  to  a  piece  of
       evidence  than  the  Panel  chose  to  give   it,   individually   or
       cumulatively, does not assist the Appellant. As found by Blake  L  in
       Green (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 254 (IAC):  "Giving  weight
       to a factor one way or another is for the fact finding  Tribunal  and
       the assignment of weight will rarely give rise to an error  of  law".
       In this case it has not been proved it does.





Decision

   49. There is no material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal  Judge's
       decision. The determination shall stand.


  Anonymity.


   50. The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
       45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
       2005. I make no such order  pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
       Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 save in relation to  the  names
       of the children.
