                                ENDAH SUNYOTO
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Secretary of State:  Mr T. Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer
For Ms Sunyoto:  No appearance


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The Secretary of State appealed against a determination of First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Geraint Jones QC who  made  a  decision  provisionally
       allowing the appeal of Ms Sunyoto (who should properly be called  Mrs
       Burrett). I shall refer to her as 'the appellant' as she  was  before
       the First-tier Tribunal.

    2. Following a hearing on 2 October 2018, I found  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge had  made  an  error  of  law  and  I  set  aside  his
       determination. I recorded that, in the event that Miss Isherwood, the
       Presenting Officer decided that it was  disproportionate  to  require
       the appellant's  removal,  she  would  notify  her  decision  to  the
       appellant and the Tribunal in order to avoid a further hearing.

    3. On 27 November 2018 Miss Isherwood wrote to the Tribunal stating that
       the error was narrowed to whether it would  be  appropriate  for  the
       appellant to leave the United Kingdom and seek entry  clearance.  The
       issue of concern was whether the appellant could meet  the  financial
       requirements and the English language requirements. At  the  hearing,
       she had been provided with copies of the  sponsor's  income  for  the
       year 2017-18 and the appellant's English  Language  certificate  from
       Trinity College of London. The income from the  sponsor  amounted  to
       ï¿½19,850 and it has been confirmed that the certificates from  Trinity
       College London are genuine.

    4. At the error of law hearing, Ms  Isherwood  had  indicated  that  she
       would look at the evidence and decide whether the Secretary of  State
       should properly seek to continue to  pursue  the  appeal  listed  for
       hearing on 5 December 2018. In light of the narrow  issue  and  there
       being no public interest in  refusing  to  apply  the  principles  in
       Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40, she accepted on behalf of the Secretary  of
       State that the appeal be allowed.

    5. At the hearing on 5 December 2018, I indicated that the appeal of the
       Secretary of State was no  longer  pursued  and  the  appeal  of  Mrs
       Sunyoto's appeal would be allowed.

  DECISION

        i) The appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed.

       ii) The appeal of Mrs Sunyoto is allowed.


                                                               ANDREW JORDAN

                                                                2 April 2019
