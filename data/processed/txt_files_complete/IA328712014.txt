                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

1.   The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal with permission from  Judge
    of the Upper Tribunal P King given on 29 June 2015.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of India who was born on 23 September  1989.
     The appellant made an application for leave to remain in the UK on the
    basis of family life on 11 September 2013, having first come to the  UK
    on 16 October 2010 as a student.   On  7  August  2014  the  respondent
    decided to refuse to vary her  leave  and  to  remove  her  by  way  of
    directions under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality
    Act 2006.  The appellant appealed that  refusal  by  notice  of  appeal
    dated 19 August 2014.

3.   The appeal came before Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Barker  (the
    Immigration Judge).  Having considered the documents produced  and  the
    oral evidence of the appellant and her sponsor, Mr Harjinder Singh Panu
    (the sponsor) and having considered the requirements of E-LTRP  of  the
    Immigration Rules including EX1 the appellant had failed to satisfy the
    Immigration Judge that she met  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules so as to be required to be given leave to remain as a partner  of
    the sponsor, her husband.  Accordingly, the Immigration Judge dismissed
    the appeal under the Immigration Rules but also dismissed it on  "human
    rights grounds" because the interference with her rights  to  a  family
    and private life would be proportionate in the light  of  the  need  to
    have effective immigration control.  The Immigration Judge referred  in
    his determination to the best interests of the child, a son born on  21
    September 2014 to the appellant and the sponsor.  The Immigration Judge
    had regard to the young age of the child and considered that  the  best
    interests of the child would be met by remaining with  the  parents  or
    with one of the parents.  Nevertheless, the refusal did not breach  the
    appellant's human rights.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

4.   By a notice of appeal dated 8 April 2015 the appellant appealed to  the
    Upper Tribunal, asserting that she was the wife of  a  British  citizen
    domiciled in the UK who was the mother of a  British  child.   She  had
    married her husband on 30 July 2013 and they  were  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with one another.  Their child had been born on
    21 September 2014.  The appellant had come to the UK as a student, with
    limited leave, she had been lawfully resident in the UK since her  Tier
    4 (General) leave expired on 31 July 2013.  On 11  September  2013  she
    had sought further leave to remain as a spouse.

5.   The determination of the Immigration Judge promulgated on 23 July  2015
    was criticised for dismissing the appeal  both  under  the  Immigration
    Rules and on human rights grounds.  It was said  that  the  Immigration
    Judge had materially erred in his application  of  the  law  under  the
    Immigration Rules at Appendix FM-SE, the  appellant  in  fact  met  the
    requirements of EX1 as  there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  her
    returning with her husband to continue family life abroad  and  it  was
    unreasonable to expect her child to relocate.

6.   Judge of the Upper Tribunal P King considered  the  grounds  to  be  at
    least arguable given that the appellant's husband may, by the  time  of
    the hearing, have qualified under Appendix FM-SE paragraph  5(b)  (ii).
    Therefore, carrying out a proportionality assessment and having  regard
    to the provisions of Section 117B, it was arguably  not  reasonable  to
    expect the appellant and her qualifying child to  leave  the  UK.   The
    interests of the appellant's husband had to be considered  as  well  as
    those of her child.  The Immigration Judge had appeared to  focus  more
    on the appellant's situation than that of the sponsor.

7.    At  the  hearing  both  parties  were  represented.  Mr  Sharma,   the
    appellant's legal representative,  explained  that  there  was  a  "new
    bundle" which demonstrated that the appellant's husband  earned  �5,425
    between 1 October  2012  and  28  October  2013.   The  documents  also
    demonstrated that he earned �13,325 between  11  October  2012  and  28
    October 2013.  Between 28 October 2013 and 28 November 2013 he earned a
    further �1,290.  Therefore, the total earnings up to  28  October  2013
    were �18,750.  Mr Sharma gave me some further figures  for  the  period
    from 11 October 2012 until 28 October 2013, stating that it was �20,040
    that was earned.  He explained that  his  client  had  a  baby  on  the
    previous Sunday and could not attend the hearing.  It had been accepted
    before the FtT that the marriage was a genuine and subsisting one.   It
    was pointed out that at the date of the application (10 September 2013)
    the sponsor was in employment with a housing body.  He worked until  28
    October 2013.  Therefore, it was claimed that,  his  earnings  exceeded
    the threshold of �18,600 required by the Immigration Rules.

8.   It was pointed out by the respondent's representative, Mr  Duffy,  that
    the sponsor had accepted at the FtT hearing that he did  not  meet  the
    earnings requirements of the Rules .  Even if this was not accepted, he
    had not earned the correct sum as at the date of  the  application  and
    thus did not fulfil the requirements of those  rules.   In  particular,
    the pay slips provided had to cover the period March to August 2013  in
    order to cover the relevant period required by the  Immigration  Rules.
    The documents supplied, including pay slips  for  a  six  month  period
    ending  on  the  date  of  the  application,  had  to  pertain  to  the
    circumstances at the date of the application.  It was  unclear  how  Mr
    Sharma had calculated his sums.  Clearly he was not able to include any
    jobseeker's allowance in his figures.  It was not clear that  this  and
    any other benefits had been excluded.  It was also pointed  out  by  Mr
    Duffy that Appendix FM-SE specified the types of documents  that  could
    be produced in support of an application.  In any  event  the  evidence
    here post-dated  the  hearing  in  the  FTT.  In  the  absence  of  any
    application to adduce fresh evidence, with an explanation for the  late
    production of that evidence, it could not be  admitted  for  the  first
    time before the Upper Tribunal.  There were no pay slips for  the  full
    period, a letter from an employer if the salaried  employment  had  not
    lasted for six months and personal bank statements had to be  supplied.
    There was no employer's letter and the documents did not satisfy  these
    requirements.

9.   Mr Duffy also explained that in addition to  the  child  who  had  been
    living with the sponsor and his wife the appellant had  recently  given
    birth to a second child. It was submitted  that  she  could  return  to
    India with her two children. It would be open to the  sponsor  to  join
    them in India if he wished to continue his family life with them there.



10.  At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my decision as  to  whether
    or not there was an error of law and if there was such  an  error  what
    steps should be taken to rectify that.

Discussion

11.  The key dates so far as the present case is concerned are:

       . 10 September 2013 - the appellant applied for leave  to  remain  as
         the spouse of a British citizen  claiming  that  her  husband,  the
         sponsor, earned �18,750.40.

       . 28 October 2013 -  the  sponsor  ceased  to  work  for  his  former
         employers.

       . 7 August 2014 - the respondent refused the application for leave to
         remain as the spouse of a British citizen, relying on the fact that
         the financial requirements under the Immigration Rules were not met
         but considering that there were no  exceptional  circumstances  for
         considering the application outside the Rules.

       . 24 September 2014 - the appellant's son was born.  I have not  been
         given her son's name in the papers supplied.

       . 19 December 2014 - the hearing before  the  FtT  took  place.   The
         appellant  and  her  husband  gave  evidence,  the  documents  were
         considered following the hearing.

       . 23 January 2015 - the decision of the FtT was promulgated.

       . 29 June 2015 - Judge King granted permission to appeal to the Upper
         Tribunal  because  he  considered  it  arguable  that  the  overall
         assessment of proportionality should be affected by the  fact  that
         the sponsor's income appeared to have  increased  since  6  October
         2014 to �20,800 and that a more generous assessment  under  Section
         117B of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  could,
         arguably, have been made.  These facts justified reconsideration by
         the Upper Tribunal.

12.  The submissions before the Upper Tribunal were directed at  the  extent
    to which the appellant satisfied the requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  However, regrettably, Mr Sharma appeared to "skate  over"  many
    of those requirements.  Although they are technical in nature  and  his
    client may have come close to satisfying them, they  plainly  were  not
    met in this case for  the  reasons  given  by  the  FTT  which  I  will
    reiterate.  I should add that it has been the intention  of  Parliament
    to adopt a strict approach to applications for leave to remain  in  the
    UK on the basis of family life.  According to  the  Immigration  Judge,
    private life was not effectively pursued before the FtT.

13.  According to Appendix FM-SE the  documents  supporting  an  application
    under that Appendix must be supported by the evidence specified in  the
    numerous  paragraphs  which  form  that  Appendix.   Paragraph  D   (a)
    specifies that only documents supplied with the application, subject to
    some exceptions, for example,  where  the  documents  form  part  of  a
    sequence which is missing, or where there is a  valid  reason  for  not
    supplying  the  documents,  must  be  supplied  with  the  application.
    Furthermore, the level of gross income (�18,600) which must be  met  by
    the sponsor needs to be calculated on earnings from employment based on
    certain specified documents.  These include pay slips  for  six  months
    and personal bank statements of a  specified  type  corresponding  with
    that period (see paragraph E-ECP.3.1 and E-LTRP.3.1 and E-LCRC.2.2).

14.  It is plain that the appellant did not meet  these  requirements.   The
    earnings specified were only �15,937 for the year  ended  October  2013
    and clear findings were made by the Immigration Judge, for example,  at
    paragraph 19 that the sponsor  did  not  meet  these  requirements  and
    therefore the appellant did not fall within Appendix FM.

15.  In my view the Immigration Judge  also  fully  considered  family  life
    more generally but noted that the relationship was of  short  duration,
    having been formed since the appellant came to the UK in October  2010.
    At the time the appellant applied for leave to remain (on 10  September
    2013) she had no children with the sponsor.  Her status in the UK could
    only be described as "precarious", the parties having only  met  on  25
    June 2013 (see her application for leave to remain at  paragraph  6.2).
    The Immigration Judge took account of Section 117B  and  gave  detailed
    reasons for rejecting the claim that it was not  reasonable  to  expect
    the appellant to leave the UK with her child.   The  Immigration  Judge
    also considered the welfare rights of that child as he was bound to do.



16.  Judge King appears to have been of  the  view  that  it  was  at  least
    arguable that this case  fell  within  an  exceptional  category  which
    needed to be considered outside the Immigration Rules.  That is not the
    way  that  the  case  was  argued  before  me.   Nevertheless,  out  of
    completeness I should consider this argument.   The assertion that  the
    sponsor now achieves the necessary income criteria for  an  application
    for a family member to come to the UK amounts to arguing that  this  is
    "a  near  miss  case".   In  my  view  it  is  not  a  case  where  the
    circumstances are in any way exceptional and the fact that the original
    application may have succeeded if it were made for the  first  time  at
    the date of the hearing before the Upper Tribunal is  not,  I  find,  a
    valid reason for interfering with the decision of the FTT.

17.  As to the welfare of the child and the extent to which the  appellant's
    family life would be interfered with by her  removal,  the  appellant's
    child is only 1 year old and it  is  unlikely  to  have  a  significant
    effect on his welfare if he returns to India with  her.   It  would  be
    reasonable  to  expect  her  to  return  to  that  country  given   the
    proportionality factors set out in the FTT's decision.

18.  The judge carefully considered whether the appellant  satisfied  either
    the "parent route" or the "partner route" to settlement  under  EX1  of
    the Immigration Rules but he was not satisfied that the requirements of
    Appendix FM were satisfied. These conclusions were also open to him  in
    my view.

19.   The appellant did not argue before the  FTT  that  she  fulfilled  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.

Conclusions

20.  The focus of  the  attack  on  the  FtT's  decision  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal has been that the Immigration Judge failed to consider whether
    in fact the requirements of the Immigration Rules  were  satisfied.   I
    have concluded that they plainly were not satisfied at the date of  the
    application, as  was  required.   Furthermore,  having  considered  the
    Immigration Judge's analysis of the case outside the Immigration  Rules
    I can find no error of law in his approach.  Therefore, the decision of
    the FtT ought to be allowed to stand.

Notice of Decision

21.  The appeal against the decision of the FtT is dismissed.  The  decision
    by the respondent to refuse leave to remain stands.

22.  No anonymity direction was made by the FtT.
