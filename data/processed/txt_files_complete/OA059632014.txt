Representation:

For the Appellant:         Mr P J White of Counsel, instructed by Farani
                    Javid Taylor Solicitors LLB
For the Respondent:      Mr S Kandola

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of the Entry Clearance Officer but I will  refer  to
    the original appellant, a national of Bangladesh born  on  28  December
    1992, as the appellant herein.
2.   The sponsor in this case is the appellant's husband.  On 6  April  2014
    a decision was made by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to  refuse  the
    appellant an entry clearance to join the sponsor as a spouse.   Refusal
    was on the basis that false information had been relied  upon  relating
    to the sponsor's employment with Linkway Cars Ltd in that checks by the
    Inland Revenue showed no PAYE employment details  in  respect  of  that
    employment.  The respondent did accept  that  the  appellant  had  been
    employed with another employer but  the  earnings  at  �18,252.86  fell
    short of the sum required under the Rules of �18,600  per  annum.   The
    respondent was also not satisfied that the appellant's marriage to  the
    sponsor was genuine or subsisting.

3.   The appellant appealed the respondent's decision and  her  appeal  came
    before a  First-tier  Judge  on  14  April  2015.   The  appellant  was
    represented on that occasion but not by Mr White.  However there was no
    appearance on behalf of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  and  the  judge
    records that there was no explanation for the absence of representation
    and there was no application by the Entry Clearance Officer to  adjourn
    the matter.  The judge was satisfied that the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    had been informed of the hearing and she decided to  proceed  with  the
    appeal under the Rules.

4.   The judge heard oral evidence from the sponsor.  The judge  noted  that
    the burden fell on the respondent to show that the sponsor's employment
    record with Linkway Cars  was  false  especially  as  the  sponsor  had
    provided supporting documents with regard to  this  employment.   While
    the Entry Clearance Officer had referred to a  verification  report  in
    the notice of the immigration decision none was available to the judge.
     The judge did not find that the Entry Clearance Officer had failed  to
    discharge the evidential burden that fell upon him in  respect  of  the
    allegation.

5.   The judge records that she was satisfied  that  the  sponsor's  monthly
    income from Linkway Cars was reflected in the bank statements which she
    had examined.  She was also satisfied that  the  sponsor  had  provided
    further letters from Linkway Cars to confirm his employment  with  them
    and also to clarify that they did not register the sponsor's employment
    with HMRC "because his  part-time  income  was  below  the  income  tax
    threshold."  The judge found that the respondent had misinterpreted the
    sponsor's income from Linkway Cars and accepted that the sponsor earned
    an annual gross figure of �6,000 from his part-time  job.   Accordingly
    taking the two employments together the appellant met the threshold  of
    �18,600.

6.   The judge found  that  the  appellant's  marriage  was  a  genuine  and
    subsisting one and accepted the sponsor was a  credible  witness.   She
    also found that there was sufficient documentary evidence to show  that
    there was suitable accommodation  for  the  parties.   Accordingly  the
    judge allowed the appeal.

7.   It is to be noted that while the appellant had lodged a  bundle  before
    the First-tier Judge no respondent's bundle had been lodged.

8.   The Entry Clearance Officer appealed and made reference to  a  decision
    notice dated 21 October 2014 which it was submitted the judge  had  not
    taken into account.  The decision before the judge was  dated  6  April
    2014.   While  it  was  not  in  dispute  that   the   sponsor   earned
    approximately �18,000 per annum from his primary employment there was a
    failure to comply with the requirements of Appendix FM-SE.   While  the
    respondent could not challenge the claim  that  there  had  been  false
    representations in respect of Linkway Cars in the light of the findings
    of the First-tier Judge it was argued in ground 7 that  the  employment
    was still required to meet the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules
    under Appendix FM-SE.  The judge had apparently had no  concerns  about
    relying on the secondary employment where it appeared that the  sponsor
    had failed to declare such income for the purposes of income tax.

9.   Permission to appeal was granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Mark
    Davies on the following point:

         "It is arguable that the judge was wrong to take into  account  the
         sponsor's part-time employment when it was clear from the  findings
         of the judge that that employment was paid without the deduction of
         tax and national  insurance  and  therefore  in  breach  of  United
         Kingdom law.  It is clear, on the  basis  of  the  sponsor's  other
         employment, that his part-time employment should have attracted the
         payment of both tax and national insurance.  The judge should  have
         had regard to this fact."

10.  In fixing a date for the hearing the  Tribunal  had  issued  directions
    requiring any material on which the Entry Clearance Officer  relied  to
    be made available to the Tribunal and the appellant no less  than  five
    working days before the hearing.

11.  In the event this material was not lodged  until  the  hearing  and  Mr
    White had had no opportunity to consider it.

12.  Mr Kandola submitted that in fact  nothing  turned  on  the  subsequent
    decision of 21 October 2014.

13.  Mr Kandola said that having inspected the documentary evidence  himself
    he was satisfied that in respect of the appellant's main employment the
    requirements of the Rules were satisfied.  The only  challenge  was  in
    respect of Linkway Cars.

14.  The claim of false representations was not maintained.   There  was  no
    issue about the bank  statements  submitted.   A  letter  was  required
    confirming the appellant's employment with Linkway Cars.  The remaining
    issue was paragraph 7 of the grounds and I was referred  to  particular
    sub-paragraphs of Appendix FM-SE set  out  at  page  1175  of  Phelan's
    Immigration  Law  Handbook  Ninth  Edition.   Mr  Kandola  referred  in
    particular to the requirement that  all  income  and  savings  must  be
    lawfully derived, that savings must be held  in  cash  and  that  "cash
    income on which the correct tax has been paid may be counted as  income
    under this appendix, subject to the relevant evidential requirements of
    this  appendix."   The  appellant's  main   employment   predated   the
    appellant's employment with Linkway Cars and tax should have been paid.



15.  Mr White submitted that the question of an employer's  letter  had  not
    been taken below or in the  decision  and  in  fact  letters  had  been
    provided by Linkway Cars.

16.  Mr White relied on his skeleton argument.  It was clear that the  judge
    had had relevant pay slips as she had said at paragraph 16 and she  had
    addressed the allegation about bank statements.   In  respect  of  both
    employments the specified evidence had  been  provided.   The  evidence
    submitted showed clearly that the requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE  had
    been satisfied.

17.  The only arguable point was the  issue  about  tax  being  paid.   This
    matter had been dealt with by the employer's letter before  the  judge.
    The primary obligation to pay tax had been on the employer who had  had
    to operate the PAYE system.  Linkway Cars Ltd had acknowledged that the
    error was theirs.  The situation was not caught by the requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE.  The Rules were  concerned  with  the  sponsor's  gross
    income and that it was lawfully derived which it was.  The sponsor  had
    not been working illegally.  The sponsor had been entitled to hold  his
    job and earn his gross income and any issue with  tax  could  be  dealt
    with by payment of arrears and proper registration.

18.  The Secretary of State's position had been that the appellant's  income
    with Linkway Cars did not exist  and  that  false  documents  had  been
    produced.  No point had been taken that if  the  income  did  exist  it
    could not be taken into account.  No such point had been taken  at  the
    hearing which the Secretary of State did not attend.  A wholly new case
    was being raised at the appeal stage.  Mr Kandola accepted  that  there
    was no issue about the point raised in  paragraph  6  of  the  skeleton
    argument in relation to the sponsor's main employment.

19.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved  my  decision.   I  can
    only interfere with the decision of the First-tier Judge if there was a
    material error of law in it.

20.  The judge undoubtedly had a difficult task because the Entry  Clearance
    Officer not only had failed to file a bundle but had failed to instruct
    a representative.  The absence of a representative was unexplained  and
    there was no application for  an  adjournment.   The  judge  lists  the
    material lodged on behalf of the appellant.  Among the material  lodged
    was a letter from Linkway Cars dated 1  April  2015.   In  that  letter
    Linkway Cars state that  they  were  not  aware  that  the  appellant's
    employment had to be registered  with  HMRC  "as  he  was  a  part-time
    employee receiving income that was below the taxable threshold.  It was
    our administrative error as we otherwise registered employees receiving
    taxable income."

21.  I accept Counsel's submission that there is nothing in  Appendix  FM-SE
    that catches the appellant in such a situation.  It has to be borne  in
    mind that it was open to the Entry  Clearance  Officer  to  instruct  a
    representative to appear at the hearing to take issue with the position
    and challenge what was  said  by  Linkway  Cars  Ltd.   I  also  accept
    Counsel's proposition that the way in which the respondent was  putting
    the case on appeal  was  not  the  way  that  the  case  had  been  put
    initially.  It was open to the judge for a variety of reasons to accept
    that the sponsor did earn a gross figure of �6,000  from  Linkway  Cars
    Ltd and that the two figures together met the relevant threshold and to
    allow the appeal on that basis.

22.  The conduct of this appeal throughout has been unfortunate to  say  the
    least.  The Upper Tribunal gave clear directions in  this  matter.  The
    material was not lodged in accordance with those directions and by  the
    time it was lodged it was too late to be of any assistance  to  Counsel
    or indeed to the Tribunal.  In the event no reference was made to  this
    material as Mr Kandola submitted that the  original  decision  was  not
    materially altered by the second decision.

23.  In the premises I am not satisfied that it has  been  established  that
    the decision of the First-tier Judge was materially flawed in law.   It
    is in fact clear from the letter from Linkway Cars  that  Linkway  Cars
    accepted responsibility for the mistake but this does  not  affect  the
    judge's conclusion that  the  sponsor  earned  the  required  sum  from
    Linkway Cars in addition to his main employment and therefore  complied
    with the relevant requirements of the Rules.

24.  I accordingly dismiss the appeal of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  and
    the decision of the First-tier Judge stands.

25.  The judge made no anonymity direction and I make none.



FEE AWARD

The judge made a fee award of �150 in favour of the appellant and  that  fee
    award stands.
