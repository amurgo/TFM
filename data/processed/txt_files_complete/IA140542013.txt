                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria  born  on  14th  July  1984.   He
    appeals against the decision of the Respondent dated 27 March  2013  to
    refuse to grant him leave to remain as the spouse of a  person  present
    and settled in the United Kingdom.  The Appellant's  wished  to  reside
    with his wife Sonia Elaine Algbomian born 5th December 1964,  a  United
    Kingdom citizen ("the  Sponsor").   The  Appellant  was  granted  entry
    clearance as a student on 4th August 2009 valid until 31st October 2012
    entering the United Kingdom on 18th August 2009.  He  and  the  Sponsor
    first met in September 2010. They married and began living together  on
    3rd December 2011. On 2nd November 2012 the Appellant applied for leave
    to remain on the basis of his marriage to the Sponsor

2.   The Respondent refused the application under Appendix FM and  paragraph
    276ADE of the Immigration Rules because the  Appellant  had  not  shown
    sufficient evidence that  he  could  meet  the  financial  requirements
    contained in Section E-LTRP3.1 and  3.2,  could  not  demonstrate  that
    exception EX.1 applied  and  could  not  demonstrate  that  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles to family life  with  the  Sponsor  continuing
    outside the United Kingdom.   He  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 276ADE in respect of private life given the length of time he
    had been in this country and he had not  shown  that  he  had  no  ties
    including social, cultural or family with Nigeria.

The First Appeal

3.   The Appellant's appeal against that decision came on the papers  before
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Pickup  sitting  at  Manchester  Piccadilly
    Hearing Centre on 3rd October 2013.  The Appellant argued that although
    the couple did not have much by way of  savings  their  joint  earnings
    amounted to more than the income support level although  the  Appellant
    accepted that he could not meet the higher  financial  requirements  of
    Appendix FM.  The Sponsor worked full-time earning �10,800 per annum as
    a cleaner and the Appellant worked part-time earned �6,000 per annum in
    a previous employment which he had  had  in  the  twelve  month  period
    preceding the application. The Appellant could not therefore  meet  the
    figure of �18,600. The Appellant stressed the fact that he was  married
    to a British citizen and that the marriage was genuine and  subsisting.



4.   The Sponsor had two children by a previous marriage  one  of  whom  was
    thus the Appellant's  stepdaughter.   A  handwritten  letter  from  the
    stepdaughter stated that she had met the Appellant in  2010  and  could
    talk to him about anything as he always listened.  She had  never  seen
    her own father and regarded the Appellant as her father as he had  done
    so much for her.  She did not want to lose such a caring man.

5.   The Judge held that the Appellant could not meet  the  requirements  of
    either Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE  or  bring  himself  within  the
    exception to those requirements contained in EX.1.  The  Appellant  had
    stated in the papers that he had a child 2 years of age but  the  child
    did not live with the Appellant.  The Judge also found at paragraph  19
    of the determination that there were  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life with the Sponsor continuing outside the United Kingdom even
    though the Sponsor's two children were both British  citizens  and  she
    would wish to  continue  her  relationship  with  them  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The Appellant  could  not  demonstrate  he  had  no  ties  to
    Nigeria.

6.   The Judge proceeded to consider the  matter  under  Article  8.   After
    directing himself on the step-by-step approach required by the case  of
    Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 he found that there was a family and private life
    between the Appellant, the Sponsor and her two children.  He  described
    the letter from the Appellant's stepdaughter which  I  have  summarised
    above  as  "written  movingly  [about]  her   relationship   with   the
    Appellant".  The Judge also had before him  letters  from  friends  and
    neighbours of the  Appellant  which  he  found  demonstrated  that  the
    Appellant was integrated into the community.  At paragraph 28 the Judge
    found it would not be reasonable to separate  the  Appellant  from  his
    family or to expect them to relocate to Nigeria with him (which appears
    to be in conflict with what the Judge had earlier said at paragraph 19)
    The Tribunal had to balance the legitimate interest  of  the  state  in
    controlling immigration to protect the economic welfare of  the  United
    Kingdom against the rights of the Appellant and what he referred to  as
    the   Appellant's   "adopted   family".    He   found   that   it   was
    disproportionate to require the Appellant's  removal  and  allowed  the
    appeal under Article 8 making a full fee award.

7.   The Respondent appealed against that decision.   Permission  to  appeal
    was granted on the basis that it was arguable that the Judge had failed
    to give adequate reasons for his decision on proportionality bearing in
    mind the Appellant's inability to satisfy the Immigration  Rules.   The
    appeal came before Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Wilson on 20th  December
    2013 when the Appellant had again asked for the matter to be determined
    on the papers.  The Learned Deputy  was  concerned  that  a  number  of
    documents prepared by the Appellant had been in front of the Judge  but
    because the Appellant had asked for the matter to be determined on  the
    papers those documents had not reached the  Respondent.   Judge  Wilson
    found that the matter had not been fairly determined in the  First-tier
    and set aside Judge Pickup's decision and remitted it back to the First-
    tier to be heard again this time orally.

The Second Appeal

8.   The matter was again listed in the First-tier this time  at  Birmingham
    on 16th April 2014 when it came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Camp.
    The Appellant attended that hearing unrepresented while the  Respondent
    was represented by a Presenting Officer.  Judge Camp noted that  at  no
    stage had any party requested an oral hearing but the  Appellant  would
    require an interpreter as his English was not sufficient to enable  him
    to conduct the hearing.  The Judge recorded  at  paragraph  11  of  his
    determination that the Appellant and the Sponsor "were content for  the
    appeal to be determined without oral evidence".  At paragraph 13  Judge
    Camp wrote "I entertain doubts as to whether it is open  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal to direct an oral hearing  if  neither  party  wants  an  oral
    hearing".

9.   He proceeded to deal with the matter on  the  papers  noting  that  the
    stepdaughter who had written the letter in support of the Appellant was
    at least 18.  He noted the reference to another child of the  Appellant
    but the Appellant's relationship with  that  other  child  was  not  of
    significance to the appeal.  There  were  no  insurmountable  obstacles
    which would prevent family life continuing between  the  Appellant  and
    the Sponsor outside the United Kingdom. The  Judge  took  into  account
    that the Appellant could not meet the Immigration Rules when  assessing
    the proportionality of the interference  with  the  Appellant's  family
    life.  He  found  that   there   were   no   compelling   circumstances
    insufficiently recognised under the Rules  and  dismissed  the  appeal.
    Article 8 was not as the Judge put it "a bypass to the requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules".

10.  The Appellant in turn appealed this  decision  taking  issue  with  the
    claim that he could not speak English.  He said he  had  completed  his
    English test in October 2012 and passed.  It was unfair to require  him
    to  leave  the  Sponsor  behind  and  return  to  Nigeria.   Whilst  he
    appreciated he did not have an income of �18,600  he  had  married  the
    Sponsor for love.  His family in Nigeria were expecting the  couple  to
    visit.  The case was having a bad effect on the Sponsor who was now  on
    anti-depressants and was unable to sleep.  He was worrying  about  what
    would become of her if he was returned to Nigeria.  It was  unfair  for
    the Respondent to expect every Applicant to be rich.  The appeal should
    be allowed.

11.  The Appellant's onward appeal came  on  the  papers  before  Designated
    Judge Shaerf on 19th May 2014.  He granted permission noting  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal has a discretion to proceed without a hearing which
    may be exercised only if it is the view of the Judge concerned that the
    appeal can be justly and fairly determined without a hearing.  Where  a
    Judge has ordered an oral hearing when the Appellant  has  requested  a
    determination on the papers no additional fee is  payable  because  the
    hearing is not  the  Appellant's  choice  but  because  of  a  judicial
    direction.  It was immediately evident why Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge
    Wilson had directed an oral hearing.  As the Appellant had attended  it
    was incumbent upon Judge Camp to conduct  an  oral  hearing.   Designed
    Judge Shaerf wrote:

     "Had he done so he  might  have  ascertained  the  nationality  of  the
         Appellant's elder child in the United Kingdom and  details  of  the
         frequency, manner and quality of the contact between the  Appellant
         and his elder child".

     The nationality of the  Appellant's  elder  child  might  be  crucially
    relevant for the engagement of the Immigration Rules.

12.  Following that decision directions were issued  by  Principal  Resident
    Judge Southern that the parties  should  prepare  for  the  forthcoming
    hearing on the basis that if the Upper Tribunal decided  to  set  aside
    the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  any  further  evidence
    including supplementary oral evidence that the Upper Tribunal may  need
    to consider if it decides to remake the decision could be considered at
    that hearing.

13.  In response to the grant of permission  the  Respondent  wrote  to  the
    Tribunal on 4th June 2014 accepting that there was an error of  law  in
    Judge Camp's determination. It would be a matter for the Upper Tribunal
    to decide whether the case was to be remitted once more to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal or to be kept in  the  Upper  Tribunal.   Notice  of  the
    hearing at Field House fixed for Thursday 26th June 2014 at 10 a.m. was
    sent by first class post to the Appellant on 28th May 2014.

14.  On 21st May 2014 Police Constable Day of the Lincolnshire Police  Force
    sent an email to the Customer Service Department of the Immigration and
    Asylum Chamber which stated:

     "I have recently had dealing with a male called Idemudia Bob  Algbomian
         date of birth 14th July 1984.  He used to live at:

     5 Fen Road, Dowsby, Bourne,Lincolnshire, PE10 0TR

     I am told by his wife Sonia Algbomian that his appeal to  stay  in  the
         UK has failed.  He is currently not living at  the  Dowsby  address
         and has taken to living with various other persons  in  the  nearby
         village of Billingborough.  His wife states that he  is  trying  to
         raise funds to travel to London because he is aware that he is  due
         to be removed.  We have attended for a couple of  domestic  related
         incidents and Sonia is very agitated about his presence in the area
         as they have separated".

The Hearing Before Me

15.  When the matter came before me, on 26th June  2014  the  Appellant  did
    not attend.  The first matter I had to decide was  whether  to  proceed
    with the hearing at all in the absence of the Appellant or  to  adjourn
    it to a further date.  In considering whether to adjourn the  appeal  I
    bore in mind the Court of Appeal decision in SH Afghanistan [2011] EWCA
    Civ 1284 that the test is one of fairness.

16.  The Appellant had been served with notice of the hearing  at  his  last
    known address.  The onward appeal against the decision  of  Judge  Camp
    was his appeal and it was therefore incumbent  upon  him  to  prosecute
    that appeal with reasonable diligence.  That would mean  informing  the
    Upper Tribunal if his address in Lincolnshire was no longer appropriate
    for him to receive correspondence.  He had not done that.   The  notice
    of hearing sent to the Appellant's last  known  address  had  not  been
    returned by the Post Office.  The  Appellant  was  aware  that  he  was
    likely to have an appeal hearing in relation to his  onward  appeal.  I
    was satisfied that he had been served and no reasonable explanation had
    been provided for his absence.  In those circumstances I  indicated  to
    the Presenting Officer that I would proceed to deal with the matter and
    not adjourn it.

17.  That being so the first issue I had to decide was whether there was  an
    error of  law  in  Judge  Camp's  determination.   The  Respondent  had
    conceded that there was. It was evidently an error for  Judge  Camp  to
    proceed to deal with  the  matter  on  the  papers  when  he  had  been
    specifically directed by a Deputy of the Upper  Tribunal  to  hear  the
    matter orally.  The Appellant had thus been deprived of a fair  hearing
    and I therefore set aside the determination of Judge Camp.

18.  The next matter was whether having  set  the  determination  aside  and
    bearing in  mind  the  standard  directions  issued  by  the  Principal
    Resident Judge I could proceed to rehear the appeal or  whether  I  too
    should remit the matter back to the First-tier such that  it  would  be
    back before  the  First-tier  for  a  third  time.   I  considered  the
    President's direction.  Had it been the case  that  the  Appellant  had
    shown some interest in engaging in this appeal I may well have  decided
    to remit the matter back to be  heard.   It  is  clear  from  what  the
    officer says that the Appellant was well aware that as a result of  the
    breakdown of his marriage to the Sponsor he  would  have  no  right  to
    remain  in  this  country  and  decided  to  disengage   himself   from
    proceedings which he had begun.  Although this case has an  unfortunate
    history, I consider that I am best placed to make a final  decision  in
    relation to the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision.

19.  I was conscious that the case had been proceeding  for  several  months
    and yet the Appellant now appeared  to  have  little  interest  in  the
    proceedings. I therefore indicated that I would proceed to  rehear  the
    matter.  I heard brief submissions from  the  Respondent  who  observed
    that  the  Appellant  could  not  meet  the  Immigration   Rules.   The
    Appellant's claim under Article 8, that he had a relationship with  the
    Sponsor and his stepdaughter now fell away  because  he  had  separated
    from the Sponsor.  There was no longer  a  basis  for  the  Appellant's
    Article 8 claim.  I reserved my decision.

Findings

20.  The Appellant's claim is to remain in the United  Kingdom  on  a  basis
    outside the Immigration Rules which he otherwise  cannot  satisfy.   As
    his relationship with the Sponsor  has  now  broken  down  and  he  has
    separated from her, her earnings  are  irrelevant.   The  Appellant  no
    longer has a claim for family life.  He has never provided any evidence
    of any significance in relation to a child he may have  in  the  United
    Kingdom outside his relationship  with  the  Sponsor.   Although  Judge
    Shaerf referred in his grant of  permission  to  appeal  to  "an  elder
    child" impplying that such a child might be older  than  the  Sponsor's
    children, this cannot be right given the  relatively  short  period  of
    time the Appellant has been in the United Kingdom.  The  Appellant  has
    provided next to no evidence of a relationship with a child of his  own
    that would engage the Immigration Rules including EX.1.

21.  When the Appellant  applied  for  leave  to  remain  he  was  asked  at
    question 10.1 whether he had any criminal  convictions  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  He replied that he had  been  cautioned  by  the  police  for
    assault upon the Sponsor which he described as arising from a joke  but
    she was not in the mood at the time  and  it  was  a  misunderstanding.
    There has evidently been more than one such  incident  judging  by  the
    report of the Police Officer who states that the police  have  attended
    on at least two occasions when the Sponsor  has  complained  about  the
    Appellant's  behaviour.   Also  of  concern  is  that  the  Sponsor  is
    described as being "very agitated" about the fact that the Appellant is
    still in the vicinity of the matrimonial home.  It  would  appear  that
    the officer is suggesting that the Sponsor is very much  concerned  for
    her own safety.  It is unfortunate that the Judges previously examining
    this  matter  did  not  place  more  significance  on  the  Appellant's
    admission of a criminal caution when deciding on the extent and  nature
    of family life  in  this  case.  (I  appreciate  recent  authority  has
    indicated  that  failure  to  disclose  a  caution  is  not  of  itself
    deception). The Appellant's desire to have this  case  decided  on  the
    papers becomes more understandable.

22.  The Appellant's case would have to be that  he  should  be  allowed  to
    remain in the United Kingdom on the basis that his private life in this
    country would be proportionally interfered with  by  requiring  him  to
    return to Nigeria. Judge Pickup who dealt with the matter first of  all
    on the papers considered that  the  Appellant  did  have  a  circle  of
    friends and acquaintances and was involved in the  community.   However
    the Appellant was not working at the time he put in his application and
    I have seen no evidence that he is  currently  working.   None  of  his
    friends who had previously written letters of support were  willing  to
    attend  court  to  give  evidence  on  his   behalf.   Judge   Pickup's
    determination was set aside because much of the evidence he relied upon
    had not been seen by the Respondent. I must therefore  re-evaluate  it.
    Given the relatively short period of time the Appellant has been in the
    United Kingdom even taking the documents at face value the claim  under
    Article 8 is a weak one.

23.  The refusal of the Appellant's application for further leave to  remain
    is pursuant to the legitimate aim of  immigration  control.  Given  the
    relatively light weight I ascribe to the evidence  of  a  private  life
    against the weight to be afforded to the  legitimate  aim  pursued  the
    interference  is  proportionate.   The  Appellant  cannot  satisfy  the
    Immigration Rules, he has no  claim  under  Article  8  for  family  or
    private  life.   I  therefore  dismiss  the   appeal  under  both   the
    Immigration Rules and Article 8.  As I have dismissed the appeal I make
    no fee award, the original fee award made by Judge Pickup  having  been
    set aside as the result of the decision of Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge
    Wilson.

Decision

     The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
    error of law and I have set it aside.  I have remade  the  decision  by
    dismissing the Appellant's appeal.

     Appellant's appeal dismissed.

     I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy interest  in  so
    doing.


Signed this  22nd day of  July   2014
