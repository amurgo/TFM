                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Proceedings

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 14th October  1986.   He
    appealed against decisions of the Respondent dated 22nd August 2013  to
    refuse his application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant  pursuant  to  paragraphs  245ZX  and
    322(3)  and  to  make  removal  directions  under  Section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. Paragraph 322(3)  of  the
    Immigration Rules provides that leave to remain or variation  of  leave
    to remain should normally be refused where there has been a failure  to
    comply with any conditions attached to the grant of leave to  enter  or
    remain.  The paragraph is thus not mandatory but rather  discretionary.
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Cameron, sitting at Taylor House on 27th  May
    2014,  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the   Respondent's
    decision and the Appellant appeals with leave against that decision  of
    the First-tier. The matter comes before me to determine  whether  there
    is an error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's decision such  that  it
    falls to be set aside and the matter re-heard.  If there  is  not  then
    the decision will stand.

2.   The Appellant entered the United Kingdom on 27th June 2010  with  entry
    clearance valid until 30th September 2012 as a Tier 4 Student.  On 22nd
    September 2012 shortly before that leave was due to expire  he  applied
    for further leave to remain, stating that he  wished  to  study  for  a
    Higher National Diploma in Business Management NQF level  5  at  Global
    School of Management based at Marsh Way, Rainham, Essex.

The Explanation for Refusal

3.   The Respondent refused this application because the Appellant was  said
    to have studied at an institution which was not the one  he  was  given
    permission to attend at a time when he was subject to Section 50 of the
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2009  by  virtue  of  extant
    leave.  Section 50 permits the Respondent to  impose  conditions  on  a
    person's leave, in this case to prohibit a  student  from  study  other
    than at the institution that the Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies
    (CAS) checking service records as the student's Sponsor.

4.   The Appellant's leave from 6th May 2010 was for entry  clearance  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student to  study  with  the  Finance  and  Management
    Business School.  Notification was received by the Respondent from that
    institution  on  12th  April  2011  stating  that  the  Appellant   had
    discontinued his studies.  To support the application he made  on  22nd
    September 2012, shortly  before  his  leave  was  due  to  expire,  the
    Appellant relied on a document from the  Learning  and  Skills  Academy
    showing that he had studied with them from 14th July  2010  until  31st
    July 2012.  The Learning and Skills Academy  was  not  the  institution
    which he had been given permission to study at when  initially  granted
    entry  clearance  and  therefore  the  Appellant  was  caught  by   the
    restrictions imposed by the Respondent pursuant to  the  general  power
    contained in Section 50.

5.   The Respondent was not prepared to grant the Appellant 30 points  under
    Appendix A of the Immigration Rules for the CAS issued by Global School
    of Management because when she checked the Tier 4 Sponsor  Register  on
    22nd August 2013 Global School of Management was  not  listed  at  that
    date.  The Respondent also refused the application under Appendix C for
    maintenance funds because of the failure to provide a valid  CAS  as  a
    result of which the Respondent was unable to assess the amount of funds
    which the Appellant would otherwise be required to show in  support  of
    his application.

6.   Section A of the refusal letter concluded with the following:

         "In  making  the  decision  to  refuse  your  application,  careful
         consideration has been given to the following:

         On 9th June 2010 you were granted leave to enter the United Kingdom
         as a Tier 4 (General) Student until 30th September 2012."

The Proceedings at First Instance

7.   At the hearing before Judge Cameron the Appellant  gave  oral  evidence
    to the effect that he had  attended  the  Finance  Business  Management
    School in Birmingham for a Higher National Diploma in Business  Studies
    until March 2011 when he refused to pay  their  fees  and  the  college
    terminated his  enrolment.   From  there  the  Appellant  went  to  the
    Learning and Skills Academy in April 2011.  The academic transcript  he
    provided for his time at that institution gave a starting date  of  his
    course (Diploma in Business Management level 5) of  July  2010  whereas
    his evidence to the Judge was that he did not  start  at  Learning  and
    Skills Academy until April 2011.  The Judge recorded at paragraph 29 of
    the determination  that  the  Appellant  was  unable  to  explain  that
    inconsistency.  The Appellant acknowledged during oral evidence that he
    was aware he had to apply for permission to switch to  another  Sponsor
    but had not done that when he had gone to Learning and Skills  Academy.
    The Judge acknowledged that the Appellant had  existing  leave  at  the
    time he switched from Finance Business Management  School  to  Learning
    and Skills Academy but he could not provide a valid CAS for the  course
    at Learning and Skills Academy.

8.   The Judge was satisfied that the Respondent had shown on a  balance  of
    probabilities that the Appellant had switched courses without obtaining
    proper permission and that there was therefore a failure to comply with
    the condition of the Appellant's leave.  The  Judge  did  not  consider
    that the Respondent's "60 day  policy"  applied  in  this  case.   That
    policy would apply where a student was part way through  a  course  and
    the sponsoring college lost  their  licence  through  no  fault  of  an
    Appellant.  In that situation the Appellant would be given 60  days  by
    the Respondent to find another college.  That policy did not  apply  in
    this case because the Appellant  "had  completed  the  previous  course
    without obtaining the relevant leave for that  institution"  (paragraph
    38 of the determination) He  was  not  therefore  part  way  through  a
    course.

9.   Global School of Management had lost their licence by the time  of  the
    decision and therefore no issue of fairness arose in  this  case.   The
    Appellant did not apply for a  variation  of  his  leave  to  attend  a
    different college.  He  was  applying  for  fresh  leave  to  attend  a
    different college. His previous leave  had  expired  by  the  time  the
    Respondent considered the application and made her decision.  The Judge
    went on to dismiss the appeal under Article 8.



The Onward Appeal

10.   The  Appellant  appealed  against  that  decision  arguing  that   the
    Respondent had  not  exercised  her  discretion  in  the  case  of  the
    Appellant and the Judge had erred by endorsing that failure to exercise
    discretion.  The grounds of  appeal  referred  to  the  Tier  4  Policy
    Guidance issued by the Respondent version 04/2012.  This stated that if
    the Tier 4 Sponsor's licence was revoked a CAS would become invalid (as
    had happened in this  case)  and  the  application  would  be  refused.
    However if the student was not involved in the reasons why the  Tier  4
    Sponsor had their licence revoked the Respondent agreed  to  delay  the
    refusal of a student's application for 60 days to allow the student  to
    regularise their stay or leave in the United Kingdom depending on  what
    leave they had.  If, as in the Appellant's case, the student's leave to
    remain had expired whilst they were awaiting a decision on the  current
    outstanding application they would delay the refusal of the application
    for 60 days to allow the student to obtain a new CAS from  a  different
    Sponsor and vary the application.

11.  The CAS issued by Global School of Management  had  become  invalid  as
    their Sponsor's licence was revoked.  As the Appellant was not involved
    in what had led to that  the  Appellant  should  have  been  granted  a
    further 60 days to  find  another  Tier  4  Sponsor  to  make  a  fresh
    application.

12.  The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson on 29th  July  2014.   In  granting
    permission to appeal he wrote:

         "The Judge dismissed the  appeal  under  paragraph  322(3)  of  the
         Immigration Rules because the Appellant had failed to comply with a
         condition attached to his previous grant  of  leave  to  remain  by
         switching to another college without obtaining the necessary  leave
         to do so.

         Ground 2 contends that the Judge erred in this respect because  the
         Respondent had  not  used  her  discretion  and  the  Judge  simply
         endorsed the act of the Respondent.  It does appear that the  Judge
         seemed unaware of the fact the refusal under paragraph  322(3)  was
         discretionary.  At paragraph 25 the Judge incorrectly asserted that
         entry clearance was to be refused if there was a failure to  comply
         with any conditions attached to a grant of leave to enter or remain
         - even though entry clearance was not actually  being  applied  for
         and the Rules stated that it  was  normally  to  be  refused  which
         imports a discretion.

         The Judge then went on to dismiss the appeal under paragraph  245ZX
         of the Immigration Rules.  It appears from paragraphs 37 and 38  of
         the decision that the  Judge  accepted  that  after  the  Appellant
         applied for further leave to remain at Global  Business  Management
         that Sponsor's licence was revoked.  The Judge acknowledged that in
         the normal course under the terms of the  Respondent's  policy  the
         Appellant should have been given 60  days  to  obtain  a  CAS  from
         another college but concluded that the Appellant could not meet the
         Rules anyway because of the breach of his original leave.

         It is correct that under paragraph 245ZX an  application  must  not
         'fall for refusal under the general grounds for refusal'.   However
         since there was an arguable error of law in respect of that part of
         the Judge's decision it is also arguable as the  remaining  grounds
         contend that the Judge should have found that there was  a  failure
         to apply the policy.

         As and when a discretion under paragraph 322(3)  of  the  Rules  is
         properly exercised that  discretion  may  very  well  be  exercised
         against the Appellant - not  least  because  in  switching  without
         permission the Appellant was arguably committing a criminal offence
         under Section 24 of the 1971 Act.  Nonetheless  it  is  not  for  a
         Tribunal at the application stage to pre-judge the  exercise  of  a
         discretion which should have been exercised but  arguably  was  not
         and conclude in so doing that an  appeal  has  no  arguable  merit.
         Permission therefore has to be granted".

13.  Responding to that grant of permission  the  Respondent  wrote  to  the
    Tribunal on 11th August 2014 under Rule 24 stating that she opposed the
    Appellant's appeal and that the Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
    directed himself appropriately.  The  Rule  24  response  repeated  the
    refusal specifically in relation to the fact that the  reason  why  the
    Appellant had been refused was because he had switched from Finance and
    Management Business School to the Learning and Skills  Academy  without
    permission.  That was the reason why the application was refused  under
    paragraph 322(3).  The Respondent's refusal to award the  Appellant  30
    points under Appendix A because the CAS  issued  by  Global  School  of
    Management was not valid was a secondary reason for the refusal.

The Hearing Before Me

14.  At the hearing before me Mr Khan who had represented the  Appellant  at
    first instance argued that there were two points to  be  decided.   The
    first was whether there was any  discretion  to  be  exercised  by  the
    Respondent and the  second  was  whether  the  Respondent  should  have
    allowed the Appellant a further 60 days to provide a fresh CAS.  Taking
    the first issue (which related to the Appellant's switch  from  Finance
    Business Management School to Learning  Skills  Academy,  reliance  was
    placed on the fact that paragraph 322(3) imported  a  discretion.   The
    Judge had recorded at  paragraph  20  of  the  determination  that  the
    Appellant felt he had no choice but to  switch  from  Finance  Business
    Management School to Learning Skills Academy because  Finance  Business
    Management School were not providing classes and he had refused to  pay
    the remainder of the college fees.  The Appellant was a genuine student
    who had completed a Diploma in Business and wished to study  here.   He
    had not done so exactly in accordance with the  Immigration  Rules  but
    they were not statute.  The purpose of the Rules had to be  considered.



15.  In relation to the second point the Respondent ought  to  have  granted
    60 days to obtain another valid CAS but that had not happened  in  this
    case.  The Judge had erred  in  not  assessing  the  failure  to  apply
    discretion.  The general ground  for  refusal  under  paragraph  322(3)
    should not be upheld.  Section 50 did not specify what  the  conditions
    imposed were but the fact that those conditions had  been  imposed  was
    not in dispute.  In reply the Presenting Officer stated that the  Judge
    had agreed that the Respondent had exercised her discretion in refusing
    leave but the Judge found against the Appellant and there was  thus  no
    error  in  the  determination.  Finally  in  response  the  Appellant's
    solicitor stated that there were two bases.  No exercise of  discretion
    was an alternative to an assessment of the CAS letter.

Findings

16.  The Appellant was refused leave to remain on two  grounds.   The  first
    was because he had breached conditions imposed pursuant to the  general
    authority contained in Section 50 of the 2009 Act and  the  second  was
    that the CAS he had produced in support of his application was rendered
    invalid by reason of the fact that the  college's  sponsorship  licence
    was revoked by the Respondent.

17.  Paragraph 322(3) which was the authority for the refusal on  the  first
    ground  imported  a  discretion  that  permission  should  normally  be
    refused.  The argument in the  case  was  whether  the  Respondent  had
    exercised her discretion before refusing under  paragraph  322(3).   If
    she had not then her decision would be not in accordance with  the  law
    and would remain outstanding for the Respondent to take and  the  Judge
    should have allowed the Appellant's appeal  to  that  extent.   On  the
    other hand if the Respondent had exercised  her  discretion  reasonably
    then the decision would be unimpeachable  and  the  Appellant's  appeal
    would necessarily fail.  If that were the case then the  second  ground
    of  refusal  would  become  irrelevant  and  the  allegation  that  the
    Respondent  failed  to  follow  her  own  policy  in  relation  to  the
    revocation of Global Management and Business Management's licence would
    become superfluous.

18.   In  granting  permission  to  appeal  Judge  Nicholson  was  primarily
    concerned with the argument that the Respondent had failed to  exercise
    discretion under paragraph 322(3).  However a careful  reading  of  the
    refusal letter shows that the Respondent was aware she had a discretion
    by  the  use  of  the  words  at  the  end  of  the  decision  "careful
    consideration has been given to the  following".   The  Respondent  was
    indicating that she was aware of the Appellant's  immigration  history,
    that he had leave as a Tier 4 (General) Student.  The  length  of  time
    the Appellant had been in the United Kingdom, studying, was a factor to
    be weighed in the balance  in  the  exercise  of  her  discretion.  The
    Respondent was aware that the Appellant was in breach of his conditions
    of leave because he had discontinued his studies at the institution for
    which he had been given entry clearance to the United Kingdom.

19.  The argument is whether the Judge understood that the Respondent had  a
    discretion but even if he did not whether  that  makes  any  difference
    given that the  wording  of  the  refusal  letter  indicates  that  the
    Respondent was aware she had a discretion and exercised that discretion
    against the Appellant.  The Judge  did  not  accept  the  argument  put
    forward on the Appellant's behalf that there had been a breach  of  the
    common law duty of fairness which the Respondent owed to the Appellant.
     The Appellant had not applied for a variation of his leave  which  was
    to enable him to study at Finance Business Management School to  enable
    him to attend Learning and Skills Academy.

20.   Given  the  breach  of  immigration  control  and  the   circumstances
    surrounding that breach as found by the Judge, that the  Appellant  had
    had his enrolment terminated because he had refused to pay the fees for
    Finance and Business Management School it  is  difficult  to  see  what
    factors weighed in the Appellant's favour such that  discretion  should
    have been exercised differently by the  Respondent.  The  argument  put
    forward on the Appellant's behalf as cited by the Judge at paragraph 23
    of his determination was that Section 50 should not  be  held  strictly
    against the Appellant as the Appellant was said to be na�ve and did not
    understand  the  provisions.   The  Judge  specifically  rejected   the
    argument that the Appellant could  not  be  taken  to  know  the  Rules
    stating that "the conditions of  leave  are  clear  as  is  the  policy
    guidance which was available to the Appellant at all times".

21.  The Judge thus rejected the argument that discretion should  have  been
    exercised differently in the Appellant's favour  for  the  reasons  the
    Appellant put forward, that the Appellant was  said  to  be  na�ve  and
    ignorant of the  Rules.   In  short  the  Judge  found  no  reason  why
    discretion should have been  exercised  differently  and  came  to  the
    conclusion that he did.  That in my view was  an  entirely  sustainable
    conclusion.

22.  There may be force in the argument  that  in  refusing  an  application
    because the CAS was no longer  valid  due  to  the  revocation  of  the
    Sponsor's licence the Respondent should have delayed a refusal on  that
    ground until the Appellant had been another 60  days  to  find  another
    Sponsor.  However given that  the  Appellant  fell  for  refusal  under
    322(3) no purpose would  be  served  by  delaying  a  decision  on  the
    Appellant's  application  while  he   found   another   college.    The
    Respondent's policy in such circumstances was irrelevant in  this  case
    because of the failure of the Appellant to  satisfy  paragraph  322(3).
    The grant of permission to appeal is predicated on the assumption  that
    the Judge made an arguable error in dealing with paragraph  322(3)  and
    should therefore have gone on to consider the Respondent's  failure  to
    apply her own policy in relation to the revocation of  the  Appellant's
    CAS.

23.  I find that the case does not get  that  far.  Whether  the  Judge  was
    right to say (at paragraph 39)  that  the  fact  that  Global  Business
    Management were no longer on the register by the  time  the  Respondent
    took her decision to refuse the Appellant's application  for  variation
    of leave did not raise an issue of fairness in the  Appellant's  favour
    matters not given that the Appellant could  not  satisfy  322(3).   The
    Judge was well aware and appears to have  accepted  that  there  was  a
    policy to give a further  60  days  where  a  sponsorship  licence  was
    revoked but in my view quite rightly, directed himself that he did  not
    need to consider that point  given  his  finding  that  322(3)  applied
    against the Appellant.  There was therefore no  error  of  law  in  the
    Judge's determination in this case and I uphold his decision to dismiss
    the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision.





Decision

     The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error of law and I uphold the decision to  dismiss  the  Appellant's
    appeal.

     Appeal dismissed.

     I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy  reason  for  so
    doing.

     The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal and  therefore  there  can
    be no fee award.
