Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss E Rutherford, instructed by Lin & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Kin Yan Choi, was born on  26  January  1977  and  is  a
    British Overseas National (Hong Kong).  She was initially granted leave
    to enter the United Kingdom  as  a  visitor  in  July  2003.   She  had
    subsequently applied for further leave to remain as a Tier 4  (General)
    Student Migrant.  A  decision  dated  17  January  2011  (refusing  her
    application due to the absence  of  a  Certificate  of  Acceptance  for
    Studies (CAS))  was  withdrawn  but  the  appellant's  application  was
    refused again on 20 December 2011.   The  appellant's  application  was
    refused under Appendix  C  of  the  Immigration  Rules  in  respect  of
    maintenance (funds).  The documents which  she  had  provided  had  not
    demonstrated that she had been in possession of ï¿½1,200  for  a  28  day
    period from 11 September - 8 October 2010.  The appellant has sought to
    rely on money held by her mother but she had not provided any  evidence
    of that claimed relationship.  Her appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Shimmin) had been dismissed in a determination promulgated on  6
    March 2012.

 2. Miss Rutherford, for the appellant, candidly admitted at the opening of
    the Upper Tribunal hearing that the grounds of  appeal  raising  issues
    similar to those addressed by the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Ejifugha  (Tier
    funds - credit) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 244 (IAC) were  not  relevant;  the
    rules to which covered the present  appellant's  application  had  been
    subject differed from those considered in Ejifugha and Miss  Rutherford
    accepted that the appellant could not  succeed  because  she  had  been
    unable to show the First-tier Tribunal that she had in  her  possession
    the funds required for a consecutive 28 day period.

 3. Miss Rutherford went on to raise an issue which, although  not  in  the
    grounds, she submitted was of particular importance in  this  instance.
    She  submitted  that  the  Decision  Maker  had  failed  to  apply  the
    "evidential flexibility policy" of the respondent in force at the  time
    of the decision.  Although she could not produce a copy of that policy,
    Mr Diwnycz, for the respondent, accepted that a flexibility policy  had
    been in force at the time of the appellant's application.  He  did  not
    object to the matter being raised notwithstanding that it had not  been
    referred to in the grounds.  Miss Rutherford  relied  on  the  case  of
    Rodriguez (flexibility policy) [2013] UKUT 00042 (IAC).  It is a common
    feature of the flexibility policies which had been in  force  for  some
    time that they give caseworkers  a  discretion  to  request  additional
    information or documents from applicants  when  they  have  "sufficient
    reason to believe" that such evidence is  in  existence  and  when  its
    production may lead to further leave to remain being granted.   In  the
    present appeal, Miss Rutherford submitted  that  evidence  which  would
    have proved  the  relationship  of  mother  and  daughter  between  the
    appellant and Ms Suk Ching Keung was highly likely to exist  and  could
    have been requested by the Decision Maker.

 4. I consider that this is an instance when the Decision Maker should,  at
    the very least, have considered requesting further  evidence  from  the
    appellant under the respondent's policy of evidential flexibility. Even
    if the Decision Maker had resolved not  to  request  further  evidence,
    his/her decision should have recorded the fact that the application  of
    the policy had been considered and brief reasons given for not applying
    it. Mr Diwnycz told me that he did not disagree with the submissions of
    Miss Rutherford.  He agreed with her that the appeal should be  allowed
    to the limited extent that the matter should be referred again  to  the
    Secretary of State to  consider  the  application  of  her  flexibility
    policy and to remake the decision in accordance with the law.



DECISION

 5. This appeal is allowed  to  the  limited  extent  that  the  matter  is
    remitted to the Secretary of State to make a lawful decision having due
    regard to the application of her evidential flexibility policy.


Signed                              Date 2 June 2013
Upper Tribunal Judge Clive Lane
