Representation:

For the Appellant:     Not legally represented
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This appeal has its origins in the respondent's decision of 22  January
    2013 refusing the appellant's application  of  28  September  2012  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant under the points-
    based system.

 2. In refusing  to  grant  the  appellant  leave  to  remain  pursuant  to
    paragraph 245ZX of the Immigration Rules  the  respondent  awarded  the
    appellant zero points under the maintenance requirement of  Appendix  C
    to the Rules.  It was observed that the appellant had been required  to
    demonstrate that he had been in possession of �8,600 for a  consecutive
    28 day period prior to 24 September 2012, that being the  date  of  the
    bank statements provided by the appellant with his application.  It was
    further observed that at no time during  the  entire  relevant  28  day
    period did the funds in the appellant's bank account surpass the �8,600
    requirement.  Indeed their high point was a balance of �8,204.23.   The
    respondent further relied upon the fact  that  the  appellant  had  not
    provided the relevant documentation proving  his  relationship  to  the
    person whose funds he relied upon, the appellant purporting such  funds
    to be his mother's.

 3. The appellant challenged the respondent's decision  before  the  First-
    tier  Tribunal.   First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Place  determined,   and
    dismissed, the appellant's appeal on  13  May  2013;  this  being  done
    without a hearing pursuant to a request made by the  appellant  in  his
    notice of appeal.

 4. In relation to the Immigration Rules the judge agreed with the  reasons
    and conclusions of the Secretary of State relating to  the  sufficiency
    of the funds within the bank account relied upon by the appellant.  The
    judge additionally observed that prior to 6 September 2012 [this should
    have been stated as 4 September] the balance of monies in  the  account
    relied upon by the appellant was minimal.

 5. When dealing with human rights grounds the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    concluded as follows:

         "10. The grounds of appeal also raise the question of  the  refusal
             breaching the appellant's human right to education.  He states
             that his career will be ruined if he is unable to  finish  his
             degree and that his parents have spent their life  savings  on
             him.  Whilst the European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  does
             provide that no-one shall be denied an education, there is  no
             obligation on a contracting state to  provide  anyone  with  a
             particular level of education.  I find that the appellant  has
             not shown that  there  is  any  breach  of  his  human  rights
             involved the respondent's decision."

 6. In his grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal the  appellant  asserted
    that he had provided further documentation to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    which had not been considered and that such documentation  demonstrated
    that the figure relating to the course fees he  had  been  required  to
    pay, as stated on the CAS form, was inaccurate; it recording the figure
    of �8000 for the course fees instead of the correct sum of �6,440; this
    now having been corrected. Additionally the  grounds  assert  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal failed to  consider  the  case  properly  and  that
    justice was not done.

 7. First-tier Tribunal Judge Sharp granted  the  appellant  permission  to
    appeal by way of a decision dated 31 May 2013, observing when doing  so
    that the grounds relating to the Immigration Rules  had  no  merit.  In
    relation to the human rights issues the judge said as follows:

         "4.  ... However the grounds of appeal clearly raise  human  rights
             issues within the principles of CDS (Brazil).   The  appellant
             had relied on the fact that  his  parents  had  already  spent
             �70,000 on his education and that all he needed was to be able
             to remain until May 2013 to complete his course.

         5.   These facts were not considered by the  judge  which  omission
             constitutes  an  arguable  error  of  law.   Permission   will
             therefore be granted.  All grounds may be argued.   It  should
             be said in conclusion that the appellant would be  advised  to
             ensure that all material evidence is available  for  the  next
             stage of his appeal."

 8. Thus the appeal came before me.

 9. The appellant did not attend the hearing and provided no explanation to
    the Tribunal for his failure to do so. A perusal of the  Tribunal  file
    confirms that the appellant was served notice of  the  date,  time  and
    place of the hearing before the Upper Tribunal by first class  post  to
    the address held for him by the Tribunal.  At the outset of the hearing
    Mr Avery informed the Tribunal that the appellant had been  in  contact
    with the Secretary of  State  approximately  one  month  prior  to  the
    hearing, to request the  return  of  his  passport  so  that  he  could
    'proceed to return to his home country'.   Unfortunately,  because  the
    appeal was pending before the Upper Tribunal the Secretary of State did
    not accede to this request.

10. In all the circumstances and having considered the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  I  concluded  that  it  was  just   and
    appropriate to proceed with the hearing of this appeal in  the  absence
    of the appellant.

11. Mr Avery submitted that the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    ought to remain standing. In  relation  to  the  Immigration  Rules  he
    asserted that even if the appellant were correct in the  assertion  set
    out in his grounds of appeal, the inaccuracy could  not  possibly  have
    made any difference to the outcome of either the Secretary  of  State's
    or the First-tier Tribunal's decision, given that prior to 4  September
    the balance in the bank  account  relied  upon  by  the  appellant  was
    minimal; consequently he could not demonstrate that he had the required
    sum of money in the account for the relevant 28  day  period,  even  if
    that sum were to be taken as less than that posited by the Secretary of
    State in the  refusal  letter.   Mr  Avery  additionally  reminded  the
    tribunal that the First-tier-Tribunal were required  to  consider  only
    those documents which were sent to the  Secretary  of  State  with  the
    appellant's application and consequently it had been correct to proceed
    on the basis of the information detailed in the CAS letter provided  by
    the appellant with his application.

12. As regards the Article 8 ECHR, although  Mr  Avery  accepted  that  the
    tribunal had erred in failing to engage in any meaningful way with this
    ground, he submitted that such error was not material  given  that  the
    appellant's case had always been that he required only to remain in the
    United Kingdom until he had completed his  degree,  which  he  had  now
    done.  Consequently, requiring the appellant to return to his  homeland
    would be proportionate.

13. I see force in all of Mr  Avery's  submissions.   Section  85A  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  requires  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in points-based cases to take into account, when dealing  with
    grounds relating to the Immigration Rules, only such  evidence  as  was
    put before the Secretary of State with the application.  In the instant
    matter the evidence provided by the appellant relating  to  his  course
    fees was that detailed in the CAS document sent  with  the  appellant's
    application. This is the document which the First-tier Tribunal  relied
    upon when coming to its conclusions and consequently it cannot be  said
    to have erred.  In any event, even  if  the  sum  for  the  appellant's
    course fees is taken as the corrected figure now  relied  upon  by  the
    appellant, it is plain that the appellant  still  could  not  meet  the
    maintenance requirement set out in Appendix C to the Immigration Rules,
    given the balance of monies in the bank account prior  to  4  September
    2012.

14. As to the appellant's rights to education, this was dealt with  by  the
    First-tier  Tribunal,  albeit  briefly.   The   First-tier   Tribunal's
    analysis of the right to education (found in Article  2  of  the  first
    protocol) was plainly sufficient given the terms of  the  decisions  in
    Holub [2001] ELR 401 and R (On the application of Mdlovu) v SSHD [2008]
    EWHC 2089.

15. Turning now to the Article 8 ECHR ground,  as  observed  by  the  judge
    granting permission to appeal there was evidence before the  First-tier
    Tribunal which related directly to the appellant's private life in  the
    United Kingdom and to the proportionality of  requiring  him  to  leave
    whilst he is studying here.  The First-tier Tribunal failed entirely to
    deal with this evidence or to come to any reasoned  conclusions  as  to
    why the appellant's appeal ought to fail on Article 8 grounds.  In this
    respect the First-tier Tribunal erred.  Nevertheless, I do not  propose
    to set aside the First-tier Tribunal's decision despite such error.

16. The appellant has been in the United Kingdom studying  since  2008  and
    there is no suggestion that he is not a genuine  student.   He  plainly
    indicates in his grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal that  his
    parents have spent some �70,000 on his studies and  that  his  ultimate
    goal is to obtain a degree; the final year of which  concludes  at  the
    end of May 2013.  In his application form for an extension of his leave
    to remain the appellant identifies the date  on  which  his  course  of
    study ends as 24 May 2013.  Turning back to his grounds  of  appeal  to
    the First-tier Tribunal the  appellant  states  with  clarity  that  he
    intends to return to his home country at the end of his studies in  May
    2013.  That date has now long passed and the  appellant  has  given  no
    indication to this Tribunal that he intends to do anything  other  than
    that which he set out in his grounds i.e. return  to  Nepal.   This  is
    consistent with the information conveyed by Mr Avery at the  outset  of
    the hearing before the Upper Tribunal. Clearly in  these  circumstances
    even if the appellant does have a private life worthy of  respect,  any
    interference with that private  life  would  plainly  be  proportionate
    given that on the available evidence the appellant neither has a desire
    to undertake any further studies or employment in the  United  Kingdom,
    nor indeed a desire to remain here at all.

17. In all the circumstances, although I find the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    have erred in law by failing to engage with the Article 8 ECHR  ground,
    such error does not lead me to set  aside  its  determination.  I  have
    found no other error in the First-tier Tribunal's determination.

Decision

For the reasons given above the determination of the First-tier Tribunal  is
to remain standing.
