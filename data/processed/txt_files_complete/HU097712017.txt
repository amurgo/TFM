Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms S Iengar, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    CAS O'Garro promulgated on 22 November 2017 refusing his appeal against
    a deportation order made on 27 June 2017.

 2. The appellant is citizen of Kosovo. His date of  birth  is  3  February
    1987. He came to the United Kingdom as an unaccompanied minor on 9 July
    2001  and  claimed  asylum.  This  was  refused  but  he  was   granted
    discretionary leave  to  remain.  On  6  August  2010  he  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain.

 3. The appellant has a number of criminal convictions which  are  narrated
    in paragraphs 3 to 7 of the decision letter. Only  one  resulted  in  a
    custodial sentence; on 22 December 2016 the appellant pleaded guilty at
    Kingston  upon  Thames  Crown  Court  of  two  counts  of  entering  an
    arrangement to facilitate acquisition, retention,  use  or  control  of
    criminal property. On 24 April 2017 he was sentenced to two  concurrent
    terms of 21 months imprisonment.

 4. The respondent made  a  deportation  order  which  was  served  on  the
    appellant on 27 June 2017. He has appealed against the  decision  based
    on his family and private life.

 5. Judge O'Garro found that the appellant had established a subsisting and
    genuine relationship with MS, by whom he had two  minor  daughters,  LK
    and IK, age 7 and 4 respectively. MS had clearly stated that she had no
    intention of going with the children to live in Kosovo. Accordingly the
    issue for the judge was whether  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  for  the
    children to remain in the United  Kingdom  without  the  appellant.  He
    found that it would not be unduly harsh and dismissed the appeal.

Submissions for the appellant

 6. Ms Iengar presented three grounds of appeal which  may  headed,  first,
    the best interests of the children; second, article 8 - proportionality
    assessment; and  third  a  flawed  approach  to  s117C(4)  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 7. In assessing the best interests of the child  the  Judge  had  accepted
    that their best interests would "in some measure be impaired". This was
    wrong as the best  interests  of  the  child  was  a  fixed  and  final
    assessment, not a sliding scale. Moreover,  the  Judge  had  failed  to
    properly consider all of the relevant material before her. She had made
    only a passing reference to the independent social work  report.  There
    was a duty to explain in clear and concise terms what weight she placed
    on the report; MK (Pakistan) 92013 UKUT 00641 (IAC).  Although the term
    'unduly harsh' appeared it was not clear that the Judge had  looked  at
    it in terms of MM (Uganda) [2016] EWCA Civ 450.

 8. The Judge had incorrectly relied on the case of Lee [2011] EWCA Civ 348
    to justify the appellant's removal  from  the  UK.  However,  this  was
    determined before the 2012 change in the Immigration Rules. The correct
    approach was set out in Hesham Ali [2016] UKSC  60  at  paragraph  169.
    Moreover no weight appeared to have  been  placed  on  the  appellant's
    private life.

 9. The Judge had erred in concluding  that  the  appellant  did  not  fall
    within the exception at s117C(4) of the 2002 Act on the basis  that  he
    had not been lawfully resident in this country for most  of  his  life.
    That was incorrect. He had come to this country at the age  of  14  and
    was now 30 years old. He had therefore lived in the UK  for  over  half
    his life.



Submissions for respondent

10. The respondent submitted a rule 24 response. Mr Clarke reminded us that
    Hesham Ali had not considered  the  recent  amendments  to  legislation
    including those effected by  the  Immigration  Act  2014.  The  correct
    approach to section 117C of the 2002 Act, as amended by the Immigration
    Act 2014 was set out by the Court of Appeal in NE-A  (Nigeria)  v  SSHD
    [2017] EWCA Civ 239. That required  a  structured  approach  which,  if
    followed, would produce a result that  was  compliant  with  article  8
    ECHR. Here the relevant provision was  section  117C(5).  The  tribunal
    would have to be satisfied that the appellant's  deportation  would  be
    unduly harsh. The complaint here was that  the  Judge  had  paid  scant
    attention to the social work report and had inaccurately asserted  that
    there was no medical evidence that the children were not fit and  well.
    However the judge had dealt with the evidence appropriately.  The  case
    of Lee acknowledged that there was balancing exercise  but  that  there
    was a strong public interest in deportation.  The  seriousness  of  the
    offending  was  clear  from  the  judge's   sentencing   remarks.   The
    immigration judge had taken account  of  these  but  conducted  a  full
    proportionality exercise in paragraphs 58 and 59.

11. Mr Clarke accepted that the Court of Appeal in  MM  (Uganda)  had  said
    that in assessing whether the effect of deportation on a child  of  the
    deportee  was  unduly  harsh  the  court  had  to  consider   all   the
    circumstances  including  the  criminal's  immigration   and   criminal
    history; paragraph 20. However a positive immigration history,  in  the
    sense of a person who had resided in the UK lawfully throughout, was at
    best a neutral consideration and not a factor in his favour.

Decision and reasons

12. The statutory framework is to be found in section 117C of the 2002 Act.
    So far as relevant it is in the following terms.


           117C Article 8: additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
           foreign criminals
           (1) The deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
           interest.
           (2)  The  more  serious  the  offence  committed  by  a  foreign
           criminal, the greater is the public interest in  deportation  of
           the criminal.
           (3) In the case of a foreign criminal ("C")  who  has  not  been
           sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
           public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception  1  or
           Exception 2 applies.
           (4) Exception 1 applies where-
                 (a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom  for
                 most of C's life,
                 (b) C is socially and culturally integrated in  the  United
                 Kingdom, and
                 (c) there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  C's
                 integration into the country to which C is proposed  to  be
                 deported.
           (5) Exception 2 applies where C has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
           relationship  with  a  qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and
           subsisting parental relationship with a  qualifying  child,  and
           the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child  would  be
           unduly harsh.

13. The appellant was sentenced to 21 months imprisonment  and  accordingly
    subsection (3) applies. The public interest  requires  his  deportation
    unless, in this case, Exception 2  applies.  The  Judge  accepted  that
    there was a genuine and subsisting relationship with both  his  partner
    and a parental relationship with qualifying children.  His partner made
    it clear that she would not  relocate  to  Kosovo  with  the  children.
    Accordingly the issue in this case was whether it would be unduly harsh
    on either or both children for him to be deported. It was not suggested
    that it would be unduly harsh on his partner.

14. At paragraph 41 the Judge considers the evidence of the social  worker,
    Miss Nikki Austin and a letter written by Dr Purewal. The reference  to
    the best interests of the children being in some measure being impaired
    by the loss of the company of their father may be clumsy but is nothing
    more than an acknowledgement that it would be in  the  children's  best
    interests for the appellant to remain  in  family  with  his  children.
    Otherwise we are not persuaded that there is any error of  law  in  the
    manner in which the Judge has dealt with the  evidence  of  the  social
    worker and Dr Purewal. Dr Purewal's letter notes that the younger child
    has found the upheaval of travelling to  visit  her  father  in  prison
    destabilising. It notes that she has had a number of night terrors  and
    is always looking for re-assurance. She  is  currently  being  seen  by
    urology for frequently passing urine in the absence  of  infection.  He
    goes on, "It is possible that this could be behavioural." Miss Ashton's
    report is to the effect that the  removal  of  the  appellant  will  be
    detrimental to the children's health and well being. Accordingly we are
    not persuaded that there is any error in the way the  Judge  approached
    the evidence before her.

15. In paragraph 43 the Judge refers to the Court  of  Appeal  case  of  AJ
    (Zimbabwe) and VH (Vietnam) [2016] EWCA Civ 1012,  and  noted  that  it
    would be rare for the best interests  of  the  child  to  outweigh  the
    strong public interest in deporting foreign criminals. She goes  on  to
    analyse the case in a little detail. Ms Iengar's submission was that in
    combination with the reference to Lee it was clear that the  Judge  had
    imposed a higher test of exceptional circumstances.  We  consider  that
    this submission is well founded. In AJ (Zimbabwe) and VH (Vietnam)  the
    Court  of  Appeal  was  addressing  IR  398.  That  rule  requires  the
    respondent to consider whether IR 399  or  399A  applies  and,  if  not
    whether there were exceptional circumstances that outweighed the public
    interest in deportation. (The requirement has now been strengthened  to
    one of very compelling circumstances over and above those described  in
    paragraphs 399 and 399A.) In other words the approach in AJ  (Zimbabwe)
    and VH (Vietnam) applies after  the  decision  maker  has  applied  the
    'unduly harsh' test in IR 399 and 399A. Even on the old wording, it was
    necessarily more stringent than the unduly harsh test.

16. The question for us is whether these errors  are  material.  Ms  Iengar
    submitted that they were. She reminded us of the definition of  'unduly
    harsh' in MM (Uganda). Contrary  to  Mr  Clarke's  submission  we  were
    entitled to take into account that the  appellant  had  lived  in  this
    country lawfully for over half his life.  There  was  a  strong  family
    relationship. The children could not be expected  to  go  and  live  in
    Kosovo. They had visited only once. The  children  were  'not  ordinary
    children'. There would be a tremendous impact on them. We  should  look
    to the particular circumstances of the  crime  and  the  disposal.  The
    appellant had pleaded guilty.

17. We are not persuaded that  the  errors  are  material.  The  sentencing
    Judge's remarks make clear  that  the  appellant  involved  himself  in
    serious organised crime. He had been caught transferring over  �300,000
    in cash and had a month previously been seen handing over  another  sum
    of cash. For sentencing purposes it was accepted that it  his  personal
    involvement should not exceed �500,000. The Judge made clear that if he
    had been convicted after trial the sentence on each  count  would  have
    been 3 years imprisonment.

18. We accept that the appellant has been in the UK for most of his life in
    terms of IR 399 and we are prepared to  take  that  into  account  when
    considering whether it would be unduly harsh on the children for him to
    be deported. There is no doubt that the appellant's removal  will  have
    detrimental  consequences  for  the  children.  That  is  the   natural
    consequence of deportation. Ms Austin's report details  the  effect  of
    deportation at paragraph 4.4. She notes the effect of  the  appellant's
    imprisonment on the  younger  child,  also  detailed  in  Dr  Purewal's
    letter. She considers that the children  have  hitherto  been  provided
    with a safe secure and loving environment. There was a very strong bond
    with the father. The appellant's partner  did  not  consider  that  she
    could take the appellant's place as a father. Studies  had  shown  that
    that two parent families were still the best environment  for  children
    to be raised in. To disrupt the family further  would  have  a  lasting
    negative impact on  both  children.  They  could  not  be  expected  to
    relocate to Kosovo. Her professional  opinion  was  that  it  would  be
    detrimental to both children's emotional health and well being for  the
    family to be  disrupted  by  the  appellant's  deportation.  For  these
    reasons there is no doubt that the best interests of the children would
    be served by the appellant remaining in the UK.  We  accept  that  some
    contact may be maintained by modern forms of communication and no doubt
    by visits to Kosovo but they are no substitute  for  continuing  family
    life as a unit.

19. These consequences can no  doubt  be  characterised  as  harsh  on  the
    children. But the question is whether conducting the balancing exercise
    that the Judge conducted in paragraphs 58  and  59,  and  applying  the
    correct test, he could have found that they were  unduly  harsh.  Every
    child is of course special, particularly to their parents,  but  we  do
    not consider that there is anything particularly out  of  the  ordinary
    about the children. They will of  course  suffer  the  consequences  of
    their father's deportation and these are ably set out  in  Ms  Austin's
    report. They are also borne out in the other evidence before the First-
    tier Tribunal from the appellant and the witness statements  listed  at
    paragraph 18. However in our opinion there is nothing  in  any  of  the
    evidence which would justify  a  conclusion  that  the  effect  of  the
    deportation on either of the children would be unduly harsh within  the
    meaning of section 117C of the 2002 Act.

20. The Judge was also in error in  holding  (at  paragraph  46)  that  the
    appellant had not lived in the UK 'most of his life' on the basis  that
    he had been here only just over half his life. In  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department v SC (Jamaica) [2017 EWCA Civ 2112 the Court of
    Appeal held  that  'most  of  his  life'  was  simply  more  than  half
    (paragraph 69). However this does not assist the appellant. Exception 1
    not only requires the criminal to have been lawfully resident in the UK
    for most of his life and be socially and culturally integrated  but  he
    must also demonstrate that there would be very significant obstacles to
    his integration into the country to which he is to be deported. No such
    evidence has been produced.


Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed.
