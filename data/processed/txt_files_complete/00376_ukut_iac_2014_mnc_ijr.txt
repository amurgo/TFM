Anonymity Direction

In order to secure the anonymity  of  the  applicant's  children  throughout
these proceedings I direct pursuant to  Rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and
Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005  that  no  report  or  other
publication of these proceedings or of any part or parts of them shall  name
or directly or indirectly identify the  applicant's  children.   Failure  by
any person, body or institution whether corporate or  incorporate  [for  the
avoidance of doubt to include either party to this appeal]  to  comply  with
this direction may lead  to  a  contempt  of  court.   The  direction  shall
continue in force until the Upper Tribunal (IAC)  or  an  appropriate  court
shall lift or vary it. The  parties  confirmed  that  anonymisation  of  the
applicant himself was not necessary.


Judge Gill:   The applicant challenges the lawfulness of a decision  of  the
    respondent of 17 October 2013 to refuse to revoke a  deportation  order
    made against him on 19 December 2012.  He  asserts  that  the  decision
    contains public law errors such that it should  be  quashed.   He  also
    challenges the lawfulness of the respondent's decision to  certify  his
    human rights claim (Article  8  of  the  European  Convention  for  the
    Protection  of  Human  Rights  and  Fundamental  Freedoms)  as  clearly
    unfounded under section  94(3)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act").  The effect of the certification  (if
    upheld) is that the applicant may only  bring  an  appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision of 17 October 2013 (if it is lawful) to refuse to
    revoke the deportation order after he has left the United Kingdom.

Immigration history and factual background

2.   The applicant is a national of Jamaica, born on 6 March  1983.   On  30
    August 1993, when he was 10 years old, he was granted indefinite  leave
    to enter on his arrival in the United Kingdom to join  his  mother  who
    was settled in the United Kingdom.

3.   On 16 June 2003, he  was  convicted  at  Horseferry  Road  Magistrates'
    Court, of three motoring offences (failing to stop after  an  accident,
    having no  insurance  and  driving  without  a  driving  licence).   He
    received a fine and a driving ban.

4.   On 29 October 2003, he was convicted  of  two  counts  of  robbery  and
    sentenced to 30 months at a young offender's institution to  be  served
    concurrently.

5.   On 30 December 2004, the respondent decided not to  pursue  deportation
    action against the applicant but he was issued with  a  warning  letter
    stating that, should he come to adverse attention in  the  future,  the
    respondent would  be  obliged  to  further  consider  the  question  of
    deportation.

6.   On 19 November  2009,  at  Woolwich  Crown  Court,  the  applicant  was
    convicted of wounding with intent to do  grievous  bodily  harm.  On  1
    December 2009, he was sentenced to seven years'  imprisonment.  He  did
    not appeal the conviction or the sentence.

7.   The conviction on 19 November  2009  precipitated  deportation  action.
    On 19 December 2012, a deportation order was made against the applicant
    under section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 and his Article 8  claim
    refused under para 398 of the Statement of Changes in  the  Immigration
    Rules HC 395 (as amended) (the Immigration Rules).

8.   The applicant appealed the decision.  On 13 April 2013, he married  his
    then partner. The couple have two children, a daughter  ("D")  who  was
    born in November 2007 and a son ("S") who was born  in  February  2009.
    The  applicant's  appeal  was  heard  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) (FtT (IAC)) on 17 April 2013 (Judge of
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  Youngerwood  and  Miss  R  I  Emblin  -  JP)
    (hereafter the "panel").  The panel  dismissed  his  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules  and  on  human  rights  grounds  (Article  8)  in  a
    determination promulgated on 29 April 2013.

9.    On  2  July  2013,  the  applicant's  representatives  requested   the
    respondent to revoke the deportation order, relying upon the  following
    documentary evidence:

    (i)  An independent social worker's report by a Ms Maxine Jones of  Nia
         Youth & Family Services dated 25 June 2013; and


    (ii) An OASys risk assessment dated 20 June 2013.

10.  Mr � Ceallaigh accepted that the following documents,  which  post-date
    the decision of 17 October 2013, could not be relied upon to impugn the
    lawfulness of the decision:

     (i) the OASYs report dated 14 November 2013 (C33-47); and

     (ii)     the London Probation Report dated 12 November 2013 (C48).

11.  The respondent considered these documents and made the decision  on  17
    October 2013 that is the subject of judicial review proceedings.

The determination of the applicant's appeal in April 2013 by the panel

12.  The documentary evidence  before  the  panel  included  the  sentencing
    remarks of Judge Byers and a completed NOMS1  form.   The  panel  heard
    oral evidence from the applicant, his wife and his mother.  It had  two
    handwritten letters from the applicant's sister and aunt.

13.  The circumstances  of  the  offence  of  wounding  with  intent  to  do
    grievous bodily harm were that the applicant went  to  the  home  of  a
    woman and attacked her in her kitchen with a knife,  leaving  her  with
    two large  cuts  to  the  side  of  her  head  which  required  medical
    treatment.  Her two children were at home at the  time,  although  they
    were not in the kitchen.  An assessment report dated November 2012 that
    was before the panel stated that the applicant knew the victim  because
    she had sold him cannabis.  He himself started  selling  crack  cocaine
    and the victim's brother owed him (the applicant) money.  The applicant
    went to the victim's home due to her brother's death.

14.  The completed NOMS1 form assessed the risk of serious harm  as  "high",
    stating that "the risk to the public is  most  likely  to  occur  if  a
    dispute arises as a result of drug-dealing activities, if the applicant
    is owed money for drugs or if he is in financial need".  The  applicant
    was assessed as posing a medium risk to his partner and children  as  a
    result of an incident in the home in which he had damaged property.

15.  The applicant's risk of re-conviction was  assessed  as  being  low  or
    medium but the report stated that the risk of re-conviction was  higher
    than that suggested by the scores, given that  the  applicant  had  two
    convictions  for  violent  offences  (robbery  and  wounding)  and  his
    acknowledgment of involvement in drug dealing.

16.  The applicant had begun his relationship  with  his  wife  three  years
    previously.   The  applicant's  wife  and  his  children  are   British
    citizens, as was the applicant's mother  according  to  other  evidence
    that was before the panel.

17.  The panel considered the applicant's Article 8 claim under  paras  398,
    399 and 399A of the Immigration Rules, introduced as from 9  July  2012
    by HC 194.  It was accepted on the applicant's behalf before the  panel
    that he did not come within para 399 or 399A of the Immigration  Rules.
    It was accepted that he did not  satisfy  para  399  notwithstanding  a
    genuine parental relationship between the  applicant  and  his  British
    citizen children because there was another family  member,  namely  the
    applicant's wife, who was able to take  care  of  them  in  the  United
    Kingdom and also because the applicant did not meet the requirement  of
    continuous residence in  the  United  Kingdom  discounting  periods  of
    imprisonment.

18.  The sole issue before the panel  was  whether  there  were  exceptional
    circumstances under para 398.  The panel considered that the fact  that
    there was a genuine relationship between the applicant and his  partner
    and between the applicant and his children could  not  amount,  without
    more, to "exceptional circumstances".  Secondly, even if  there  was  a
    genuine relationship,  an  application  could  not  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules unless the requirements of the Rules were met,  which
    was not the case in  the  panel's  view.   Lengthy  residence  was  not
    material in the panel's view because lengths of residence were  covered
    under the Immigration Rules with the result that  length  of  residence
    that did not satisfy the Immigration Rules could not  (in  the  panel's
    view) be a material consideration.  The panel accepted  that  questions
    of the applicant's links  with,  and  any  problems  relating  to,  his
    country of origin may come into the equation, but  it  considered  that
    the applicant was a fit and healthy young man who had spent  his  first
    formative years in Jamaica.

19.  The panel  concluded  that  there  were  no  exceptional  circumstances
    outweighing the public interest in  deportation.   The  fact  that  the
    applicant nearly met some of the requirements of the Immigration  Rules
    could not avail him because "near-misses" could not be relied upon.

20.  As at the date of the hearing before the panel,  the  judgment  of  the
    Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA  Civ  1192  had  not
    been delivered.  Accordingly, the panel applied  the  guidance  of  the
    Upper Tribunal in MF (Article 8 - New Rules) (Nigeria) [2012] 00393 and
    Izuazu (Article 8 - New Rules) [2013]  UKUT  00045  (IAC).   The  panel
    carried out the five-step assessment explained at para 17 of R (Razgar)
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 27.

21.   In  relation  to  proportionality,  the  panel  quoted  from   several
    authorities, including R (Londonvi) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 185  (Admin)  in
    which  Leggatt  J  emphasised  the  necessity  for  the  respondent  or
    tribunals to consider the principles outlined in the decision in Maslov
    v Austria [2007] 1 F.C.R. 707, stating that there would need to be very
    serious reasons to justify the exclusion of those who had  either  been
    born in, or spent most of their childhood in the host country, all  the
    more so where those offences had been committed when the offender was a
    juvenile.  The panel noted that the  Court  stressed  that  there  were
    three important facets of the public interest  in  the  deportation  of
    offenders: the risk of re-offending, deterring foreign  nationals  from
    committing offences, and  reflecting  society's  revulsion  of  serious
    crimes.

22.  In view of the fact that Mr � Ceallaigh submitted before  me  that  the
    decision of the panel was "finely balanced", it is necessary for me  to
    quote paras 22 to 27 of its determination:

    "22. Proceeding to  apply  the  above  principles  to  this  particular
        appellant, the following factors are of relevance:-


        (a)  As confirmed above, we are satisfied that genuine family  life
           exists between the appellant, his wife and his children.


        (b)  The effect of the deportation order would  be  to  sever  that
           relationship, because it is clear that  the  wife  and  children
           cannot be expected to  move  to  Jamaica  given  that  they  are
           British citizens and,  in  any  event,  it  being  in  our  view
           unreasonable to expect them to do so given their  lack  of  ties
           with Jamaica and the extent of family life of the  wife  in  the
           UK.


        (c)  It is a 'primary consideration', in  the  balancing  exercise,
           for us to consider the best interests  of  the  children.   Some
           caution must be expressed because, on any basis,  the  appellant
           has had very little real contact with his younger child, and the
           extent of contact with his older child, born in  November  2007,
           has been materially affected by the period of three and  a  half
           years  imprisonment  from  2009.   Also,  the  extent   of   his
           criminality, which we consider in more detail hereafter, must be
           a worrying factor, insofar as  it  may  affect  the  example  he
           provides for his children.  The appellant is considered, in  the
           reports available to us, to be a high risk to  the  public,  and
           the very serious offence for which he was convicted of [sic]  is
           relatively recent and committed when he was an adult.   However,
           it is not for us to speculate but, rather, make proper  findings
           or inferences on the evidence before us.  We were  impressed  by
           the evidence of the appellant's  wife.   She  struck  us  as  an
           honest individual and we, therefore, give  some  weight  to  her
           assertions that, not only is her relationship and love  for  the
           appellant genuine, but that the children, especially  the  older
           child, miss, and rely upon, the appellant, and that,  albeit  in
           the very brief time he has  been  released,  the  appellant  has
           played a significant  role  in  helping  to  take  care  of  the
           children.  That being so, we are ultimately persuaded that it is
           not only in the best interests of the children, as  conceded  by
           the respondent, to remain in the UK with their mother, but  that
           it is in their best interest to be with their father.  That,  as
           we say, is a 'primary consideration' but is not a 'trump  card',
           ultimately, there is really only a single  question  before  us,
           namely whether the effect of deportation on the  family  amounts
           to a disproportionate interference with their rights to  private
           and family life,  given  that  the  offences  committed  by  the
           appellant do of themselves justify deportation unless  he  meets
           the relevant exception, relying on  Article  8.   We  also  take
           account of the decision of the Court of Appeal  in  Deron  Peart
           [2012] EWCA Civ 568, emphasising that in  considering  the  best
           interests of the children, consideration should be given  as  to
           how the relationship between  the  appellant  and  the  children
           might develop in the future, if the appellant  were  allowed  to
           stay.  That is especially important, given  the  fact  that  the
           appellant has only been very recently effectively reunited  with
           his children.


        (d)  We fully take account of the requirement  in  Maslov  (above),
           that, in the case of a settled migrant lawfully present and  who
           had spent the major part of  his  youth  in  the  UK,  which  we
           consider applies to the  appellant,  very  serious  reasons  are
           needed to justify removal.


        (e)  A crucial factor  in  this  balancing  exercise  must  be  our
           consideration, in accordance with the case law  detailed  above,
           of the weight we give to the clear public interest factors which
           arise in this case, based upon the appellant's criminality.


    23.  In considering this last factor, the following  factors,  and  our
        views thereon, are relevant:-


        (a)  Having shown his  disregard  for  traffic  law  in  2003,  the
           appellant shortly thereafter was convicted of  two  offences  of
           robbery and sentenced to thirty  months  in  a  Youth  Offending
           Institution.  This was when he was aged about 20  and  therefore
           not a juvenile and was also before  his  relationship  had  been
           formed with his current partner.   The  appellant's  criminality
           was, therefore, set in motion well before any problems  relating
           to finances arose in the context of his  relationship  with  his
           current partner.


        (b)  Of great significance is the fact that the respondent did not,
           as she was entitled to, institute  deportation  proceedings  for
           the serious robbery offences, but, rather, allowed the appellant
           to get away, in terms, with a clear warning  as  to  his  future
           conduct.


        (c)  That warning was clearly ignored by the very  serious  offence
           committed in 2009, at a time when his  family  life,  with  this
           wife and two children, had been established.


        (d)  In relation to the 2009 offence, it is clear, that contrary to
           representations made on behalf of  the  appellant,  he  did  not
           plead guilty but, as can be seen  from  the  sentencing  remarks
           (above), contested the case.  The judge added that the appellant
           had 'shown  no  remorse'.   The  offence  was  extremely  nasty,
           involving attacking a woman with a knife in her home  and  where
           there were children present in the home, albeit  not  apparently
           in the room where the attack took place.  Even more  worryingly,
           the judge referred to a 'drugs background' to the case, and this
           is confirmed by the report, quoted above, as  to  the  appellant
           having acknowledged his involvement in drug  dealing  and,  even
           more serious, by the reference in the assessment report of  2013
           as to the appellant having started to sell  crack  cocaine.   It
           seems fairly clear that this very serious assault on  the  woman
           was  simply  due  to  a  debt  owed  by  her  brother.    Hardly
           surprising, in our view, that the appellant is considered to  be
           a high risk to the public and he is not,  frankly,  assisted  by
           the incidents of domestic  violence,  albeit  relatively  minor,
           referred to in the evidence (above).


    24.  There is no mitigation that we can see in relation  to  this  very
        serious offence and, indeed, Ms Nnamani did not seek to argue  such
        mitigation.  She only makes very brief reference to the fact of the
        conviction  in  her  skeleton  argument   as   being   a   relevant
        consideration for us.  We note that the appellant has expressed his
        remorse before us and has not tried to mitigate  his  offence  but,
        frankly, it would be difficult for him to do so in any event.


    25.  At the end of the day, we have to balance the  factors  supporting
        and affecting the appellant's family and private life  in  the  UK,
        and especially his life with his wife  and  children,  taking  full
        account, as a primary consideration, that the best interests of the
        children, on our finding, are to remain with the appellant, and  to
        balance those factors as against the very clear  duty  to  consider
        the public interest, that interest  being  greater  in  deportation
        cases than in ordinary removal cases, as  established  in  case-law
        quoted above.


    26.  In our view, we  cannot  minimise,  let  alone  ignore,  the  very
        serious criminality of this appellant in committing  offences  when
        he as an adult and  especially  after  the  clear  opportunity  and
        warning given to him, offences for which there are [sic] absolutely
        no mitigation.  They  are  offences  of  extreme  gravity,  with  a
        background of serious drug dealing.  We consider that we  would  be
        totally failing in our duty to consider  the  public  interest  and
        need to express deterrence and revulsion at the appellant's crimes,
        and to  consider  the  protection  of  the  public  against  future
        criminality, by affording greater weight, in this particular  case,
        to the appellant's clear  family  life  in  the  UK  and  the  best
        interests of his children.  There are cases where there can only be
        sympathy for an appellant's partner, as in  this  case,  where  the
        consequences of an appellant's  criminality  is  to  break  up  the
        family and, even more so, where the children are  to  be  affected.
        That, however, is bound to be  the  consequence  of  a  deportation
        order, made on proper grounds, and where the Tribunal is  satisfied
        that the interests and  protection  of  the  public  outweighs  the
        interests, however powerful, of the continuance of family  life  in
        the UK.  LJ Sedley, in the decision in Ad Lee [2011] EWCA Civ  348,
        commented, in relation to that case, that  the  tragic  consequence
        was that this family,  albeit  short  lived,  would  be  broken  up
        forever because of the appellant's bad behaviour.  That  was  often
        the consequence of deportation.  That, sadly,  is  the  consequence
        which will follow from our findings.  There are, in our view, 'very
        serious reasons', to use the wording from Maslov (above),  in  this
        case justifying deportation.


    27.  We conclude that, having carefully considered the relevant factors
        and the  balancing  exercise  inherent  in  the  Article  8  issue,
        following the principles of Razgar, adapted to  deportation  cases,
        the  respondent  establishes  that  the  decision  is  lawful   and
        proportionate."

The fresh evidence

23.  The report dated 25 June 2013 of Ms Maxine Jones followed her visit  to
    the home of the applicant and his wife on 24 June 2013. Ms Jones was  a
    founder and director of Nia Youth & Family Services. She said  she  had
    undertaken an independent social work assessment.  On the first page of
    her report, Ms Jones listed the documents that were before  her.   This
    does not include the panel's determination.

24.  In her report, Ms Jones states, inter  alia,  that  the  applicant  had
    become a significant part of the lives of the children in the  previous
    six months and that their separation from him would have a "devastating
    and detrimental effect" on them.  She referred to  the  fact  that  the
    applicant had informed her that his wife had informed him that D  would
    run to the door each time there was a knock at the  door,  calling  out
    his name in expectation of his return home. Based on this evidence,  Ms
    Jones said that D was "a little girl who was accustomed to  running  to
    the door expecting her father's return" and that  the  significance  to
    her of having her father back in her life should not be underestimated.
     Now that he was back and playing a significant role in her life,  such
    upheaval would traumatise her and have a detrimental impact on her both
    in the short-term and in the long-term.  She said that research  showed
    that removal of a parent from a child's life often results in  feelings
    of loss and abandonment. Children may feel anger towards the  remaining
    parent and may act out or display aggressive behaviour.  The impact  on
    S would be equally devastating and would have  deleterious  effects  on
    his  growth  and  development.  Research  showed   that   boys   suffer
    significantly when they grow up without their fathers  in  their  life,
    many turning to the "streets" and a life  of  crime.   Given  that  the
    applicant's wife would be a single parent,  it  is  unlikely  that  she
    would be able to afford sporadic visits to Jamaica.  It was likely that
    the applicant's wife will have major difficulties coping  on  her  own.
    The risk of her experiencing depression was quite high since she  could
    feel that she is unable to meet the needs of her children.

25.  The OASys Report dated 20  June  2013  stated,  inter  alia,  that  the
    applicant had undertaken an assessment  with  the  Bexley  drugs  team.
    They confirmed that he did not  require  any  further  assistance  from
    them, that he had continued to  report  for  supervision  and  had  not
    presented any concerns in relation to a return  to  illegal  drug  use.
    They did not consider that there were any current concerns in  relation
    to safeguarding issues.  The applicant  had  engaged  well  with  their
    education, training and employment provider throughout his  supervision
    period to date.  The applicant had had no  formal  warnings  whilst  on
    licence and there was no information from the local police  or  through
    MAPPA Information Exchange to suggest that there was any further police
    contact or concerns regarding his behaviour.  In  those  circumstances,
    the risk that the applicant posed  of  harm  to  the  public  had  been
    reduced from "high risk" to "a medium risk"  of  harm  to  the  public,
    known adults and children.

26.  The Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) that was before the sentencing judge  and
    the panel assessed the applicant, as stated above, as presenting a high
    risk of serious harm to the public.  The PSR explained "high  risk"  in
    the applicant's case meant:


         "Members of the public are at risk of physical  or  emotional  harm
         arising from being the victim of a robbery (previous conviction) or
         an assault.  Given the use of a weapon in the  current  offence  of
         wounding, there is a potential for serious injury.  The risk to the
         public is most likely to occur if a dispute arises as a  result  of
         drug dealing activities/if [the applicant] is owed money for  drugs
         or if he is in financial  need.  The  [applicant]  is  assessed  as
         posing a medium risk to his partner and children as a result of  an
         incident in the house in which he damaged property. He  received  a
         caution for the his offence (03/04/09)"


27.  "Medium risk" in relation to the OASys assessment dated  20  June  2013
    was explained as follows:

         "Medium risk means that there are identifiable indicators  of  risk
         of serious harm and that there is the potential  to  cause  serious
         harm but [the applicant] is unlikely to do so  unless  there  is  a
         change of circumstance.  He is not assessed as currently presenting
         imminent risk of harm."

The respondent's decision dated 17 October 2013

28.  As at the date of the respondent's  decision,  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    judgment in MF (Nigeria) had  not  been  delivered.   Accordingly,  the
    respondent applied the guidance of the Upper Tribunal in  MF  (Nigeria)
    and Izuazu whilst stating that she did not accept  the  correctness  of
    the guidance in question.

29.  The respondent referred to the fact that para 396  of  the  Immigration
    Rules states that, where a person is liable to deportation, the  public
    interest requires it.  The respondent  concluded  that  there  were  no
    exceptional circumstances under para 398 of the Immigration Rules.  The
    decision-maker considered that the report of Ms Jones and the  evidence
    of the reduction in the risk posed to members of the public of  serious
    harm from "high" to "medium" amounted to "no more than  a  disagreement
    with the findings of [the panel]" and "added nothing new that could  be
    considered as exceptional".

30.  In response to  the  reduction  in  the  risk  of  harm  posed  by  the
    applicant  from  "high"  to  "medium"  following  his   attendance   on
    rehabilitation courses, the decision-maker considered  (para  40)  that
    the applicant was still assessed as posing a significant risk  of  harm
    to members of the public.  Although it was acknowledged from the report
    that the applicant had fully complied with the  conditions  imposed  by
    his licence, it was considered that it was in his best interests to  do
    so as failure to do so would have resulted in his recall to prison.

31.  In assessing the Article 8 claim pursuant to the approach explained  by
    the Upper Tribunal in  MF  (Nigeria)  and  Izuazu,  the  decision-maker
    relied upon the guidance in Devaseelan * [2002]  UKIAT  00702,  setting
    out extracts from the determination of the panel, and  concluding  that
    the representations submitted on the applicant's behalf amounted to "no
    more than a disagreement with the findings of [the panel].

32.  The decision-maker distinguished the case of Maslov v  Austria  on  the
    basis that the applicant in that case had committed the offences whilst
    he was young (at the ages of 14  and  15)  and  that  the  offences  in
    question were non-violent in nature, whereas the applicant was aged  26
    at the date of his offence and sentenced to seven  years'  imprisonment
    for an offence of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm.

33.  At para 47, the decision-maker noted that the  applicant's  wife  would
    have the full support of her extended family in the United  Kingdom  in
    caring for her children, as evident during the time that the  applicant
    had spent in prison.

34.  At para 50, the decision-maker stated that the applicant had failed  to
    demonstrate that his circumstances were materially different  now  than
    when considered at his appeal on  29  April  2013.   It  was  therefore
    considered that his claims under the ECHR must clearly fail.

The applicant's case

The challenge to the section 94(3) certification

35.  The applicant's skeleton argument ([68.b.ii]) states that the  risk  of
    re-offending has reduced to "low". However, this is based  on  evidence
    that post-dates the decision,  that  is,  the  OASYs  report  dated  14
    November 2013  (C33-47)  and  the  London  Probation  Report  dated  12
    November 2013 (C48). As stated above, Mr � Ceallaigh  accepted  at  the
    hearing that these post-decision documents could not be relied upon  to
    impugn the lawfulness of the decision.

36.  Mr � Ceallaigh submitted that the  panel's  determination  was  "finely
    balanced".  It is said that the new material produced (described above)
    was significant for the following reasons:


    (i)  Mr � Ceallaigh submitted that the panel had repeatedly referred to
         the high risk posed by the applicant. It would be  na�ve  to  think
         that the panel had found that the risk  of  serious  harm  was  not
         high, as contended by Ms Patry. Since  the  hearing,  the  risk  of
         serious harm to the public had reduced from "high" on the  evidence
         before the panel to "medium".  The applicant  has  lived  with  his
         family and committed no further offences.


    (ii) The OASys Report showed that the applicant  had  demonstrated  his
         remorse to the Probation Services on several  occasions.  They  had
         been impressed with his conduct.


    (iii)    The panel had accepted that the applicant's family should  not
         be required to leave the United Kingdom and  that  it  was  in  the
         interests of the children for the family to remain together on  the
         evidence already available to the panel at the time.  It was  clear
         that the panel considered that, given that the applicant had little
         contact with the younger son and that he  had  only  been  recently
         reunited with the children, his  ties  to  the  children  were  not
         strong enough.  In addition, there was no evidence before the panel
         of the actual damage to the children if the applicant was deported.




    (iv) Time has passed since the last hearing. Passage of time in  itself
         affects the strength of human relationships.   The  report  of  the
         independent social worker showed that the applicant's  relationship
         with his wife and  children  had  strengthened  since  the  hearing
         before the panel.  The children have very strong relationships with
         the applicant. Both are likely to be very significantly damaged  by
         the applicant's deportation. The applicant is central to D's  life.
         D is likely to be traumatised if  the  applicant  is  removed.  His
         deportation is likely to be devastating for the applicant's wife.


    (v)  Given that different Tribunals  assessing  the  same  facts  could
         lawfully come  to  opposite  conclusions  in  the  Article  8  ECHR
         balancing  exercise,  that  the  panel  could  have   allowed   the
         applicant's appeal under Article 8 without making an error of  law.
         Mr � Ceallaigh submitted that the decision of the panel was  evenly
         balanced. The findings of the panel would not  be  binding  in  any
         future appeal. A new Tribunal would  have  to  assess  all  of  the
         relevant facts as at the date of the hearing which would include an
         assessment of the new evidence.


    (vi) Given the reduction in the risk of serious harm, the strengthening
         of the family life enjoyed, the remorse of the  applicant  and  the
         principles in Maslov v Austria, the decision to certify  the  claim
         was unlawful.


    (vii)    Although the social worker was not medically qualified,  Mr  �
         Ceallaigh submitted that one does not have to be qualified in order
         to express the opinion  that  the  applicant's  wife  would  suffer
         depression if the applicant were to be removed.


37.  Mr � Ceallaigh submitted that this was a case  where  a  small  factual
    change in the circumstances could make a difference.  This  is  because
    the findings of the panel were finely balanced, in his submission.

38.  Mr � Ceallaigh submitted that the guidance in Devaseelan was  concerned
    with factual findings, whereas the instant case concerns an  evaluation
    of an individual's circumstances under Article 8.




The challenge to the lawfulness of the refusal  to  revoke  the  deportation
    order

39.  Mr � Ceallaigh submitted that the decision  to  refuse  to  revoke  the
    deportation order was unlawful and should be quashed  for  the  reasons
    given at [86]-[89] of the skeleton argument.  In summary:

    (i)   The  decision-maker  had  failed  entirely  to  engage  with  the
         substance of the report of Ms Jones.  This was a  clear  breach  of
         section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009
         (the "2009 Act").


    (ii) The decision-maker had failed to engage with the importance of the
         reduction in the applicant's risk.  This was  material,  given  the
         panel's repeated mention of the high risk  of  harm  posed  by  the
         applicant.


    (iii)    It was irrational for the decision-maker to  say  ([40])  that
         the applicant's good behaviour during and since imprisonment  could
         be ignored on the basis that it was in his interests to  behave  in
         that way in order to avoid being recalled to prison.

40.   Mr  �  Ceallaigh  submitted  that  the  applicant  did  not  have   an
    alternative remedy in respect of this  challenge.   Although  he  could
    raise the same arguments in an appeal before the FtT (IAC) to challenge
    the decision on the ground that it was not in accordance with the  law,
    this would not be an adequate alternative remedy.  Given  that  he  was
    not being given an in-country right of appeal, it  was  important  that
    the decision to refuse to revoke the deportation order be a lawful one.

Relevance  or  otherwise  of  the  respondent's   policy   entitled:   ""Non
Suspensive Appeals (NSA) Certification under  section  94  of  the  NIA  Act
2002"

41.  At the hearing, Mr � Ceallaigh submitted  the  decision  to  refuse  to
    revoke the deportation order was made in breach of the policy entitled:
    ""Non Suspensive Appeals (NSA) Certification under section  94  of  the
    NIA Act 2002", although para 49 of the skeleton  argument  relied  upon
    the policy in the challenge to the decision to certify  as  opposed  to
    the lawfulness of the refusal to revoke to the deportation order.

42.  Mr � Ceallaigh referred to the examples at [5.1.10] of  the  policy  of
    circumstances that are not suitable  for  certification.  He  submitted
    that this guidance applied to considerations of applications to  revoke
    deportation orders.  Ms  Patry  submitted  that  this  policy  was  not
    applicable to applications to revoke deportation orders.

43.  I record that after some discussion, the parties  agreed  that  it  was
    not necessary for me to resolve the question whether the policy applied
    to applications to revoke a deportation order, given that it was for me
    to reach my own conclusion as to  whether  the  applicant's  Article  8
    claim was bound to fail in an appeal before the FtT (IAC) and that,  if
    I did not uphold the certification, it would be for the  FtT  (IAC)  to
    reach its own conclusion on whether deportation would be in  breach  of
    Article 8. Thus, the question whether  the  respondent  had  failed  to
    apply her policy (if it applies) becomes irrelevant.

Assessment

The certification issue - the relevant legal principles

44.  In any future appeal, the  FtT  (IAC)  would  be  bound  to  begin  the
    assessment of Article 8 by considering the relevant Immigration  Rules,
    which provide:

    "390.    An application for revocation of a deportation order  will  be
         considered in the light of  all  the  circumstances  including  the
         following:

         (i)      the grounds on which the order was made;
         (ii)     any representations made in support of revocation;
         (iii)    the interests of the community, including the  maintenance
             of an effective immigration control;
         (iv) the interests of the applicant,  including  any  compassionate
      circumstances.

    391. In the case of a person who has been deported ...

    396. Where a person is liable to deportation the presumption  shall  be
         that the public interest requires deportation. It is in the  public
         interest to deport  where  the  Secretary  of  State  must  make  a
         deportation order in accordance with section 32 of the  UK  Borders
         Act 2007.

    398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary  to
         the  UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the   Human   Rights
         Convention, and

         (a)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
             public good because they have been convicted of an offence for
             which they have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of
             at least 4 years;

         (b)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
             public good because they have been convicted of an offence for
             which they have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of
             less than 4 years but at least 12 months; or

         (c)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
             public good because, in the view of the  Secretary  of  State,
             their  offending  has  caused  serious  harm  or  they  are  a
             persistent offender who shows a particular disregard  for  the
             law,


         the Secretary of  State  in  assessing  that  claim  will  consider
         whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not, it  will
         only be in exceptional circumstances that the  public  interest  in
         deportation will be outweighed by other factors.

    399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c) applies if -


      (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with
         a child under the age of 18 years who is in the UK, and


         (i)  the child is a British Citizen; or
         (ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for at least the  7
             years  immediately  preceding  the  date  of  the  immigration
             decision; and in either case
             (a)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
          the UK; and
             (b)  there is no other family member who is able to  care  for
             the child in the UK; or


    (b)  the person has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled  in  the
         UK, or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and




         (i)  the person has lived in the UK with valid  leave  continuously
             for at least the 15 years immediately preceding  the  date  of
             the  immigration   decision   (discounting   any   period   of
             imprisonment); and
         (ii) there are insurmountable obstacles to family  life  with  that
             partner continuing outside the UK.

    399A.    This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or  (c)  applies
      if -

    (a)  the person has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20  years
         immediately  preceding  the  date  of  the   immigration   decision
         (discounting any  period  of  imprisonment)  and  he  has  no  ties
         (including social, cultural or family) with the country to which he
         would have to go if required to leave the UK; or

    (b)  the person is aged under 25 years, he has spent at least  half  of
         his life living continuously in the UK  immediately  preceding  the
         date  of  the  immigration  decision  (discounting  any  period  of
         imprisonment) and he has no ties  (including  social,  cultural  or
         family) with the country to which he would have to go  if  required
         to leave the UK."

     (my emphasis)

45.  Although Mr � Ceallaigh did not go as far as to say that  the  guidance
    in Devaseelan was not relevant in Article  8  cases  which  involve  an
    evaluation of the  circumstances  that  apply  in  an  individual  case
    against the state's interests, he appeared to suggest that the guidance
    was of reduced relevance. In Devaseelan, the  Tribunal  made  it  clear
    that the previous panel's findings are an assessment of the issues that
    were before that panel at the time that decision was made. That  is  an
    observation  that  applies  equally  in  Article  8  cases.  Under  the
    Devaseelan guidelines, the FtT (IAC) in a future appeal would be  bound
    to remind itself that its task is to evaluate whether deportation would
    be in breach of Article 8 on the evidence before it taking into account
    the relevant Immigration Rules and the  findings  of  the  panel  as  a
    determination of the applicant's Article 8 claim at the date the  panel
    made its decision.

46.  In relation to the Immigration Rules, it is important to note that  the
    panel did not have the benefit of the judgment of the Court  of  Appeal
    in MF (Nigeria).  Applying the judgment of the Court of  Appeal  in  MF
    (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, the first step for the FtT would
    be to consider whether para 399 or 399A apply. If either applied,  then
    the new rules implicitly provide that deportation would be contrary  to
    Article 8. If neither applied, the concluding words of para 398 require
    consideration  of  whether  there  were  exceptional  circumstances  to
    outweigh the public interest, there being a presumption  (para  396  of
    the Immigration Rules) that the public interest requires deportation.

47.  As to the meaning of  "exceptional  circumstances"  in  para  398,  the
    Court of Appeal said in MF (Nigeria) said:

    "42. At para 40, Sales J [in R (Nagre) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
         Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin)] referred to a statement in
         the case law that, in "precarious" cases, "it is likely to be  only
         in the most exceptional circumstances that the removal of the  non-
         national family member will constitute a violation of art 8".  This
         has been repeated and adopted by the ECtHR in near identical  terms
         in many cases.  At paras 41 and 42, he said that in a  "precarious"
         family life  case,  it  is  only  in  "exceptional"  or  "the  most
         exceptional circumstances" that removal of the non-national  family
         member will constitute a violation of article  8.    In  our  view,
         that is not to say that a test of exceptionality is being  applied.
         Rather it is that, in approaching the question of  whether  removal
         is a proportionate interference  with  an  individual's  article  8
         rights, the scales are heavily weighted in  favour  of  deportation
         and something very compelling  (which  will  be  "exceptional")  is
         required to outweigh the public interest in removal.  In our  view,
         it is no coincidence that the phrase "exceptional circumstances" is
         used in the new rules in the  context  of  weighing  the  competing
         factors for and against deportation of foreign criminals.


    43.  The word "exceptional" is often used to denote a departure from  a
         general rule.  The general rule in the present context is that,  in
         the case of a foreign prisoner to whom paras 399 and  399A  do  not
         apply, very compelling reasons will be  required  to  outweigh  the
         public interest in deportation.  These compelling reasons  are  the
         "exceptional circumstances".


    44.  We would, therefore, hold that the new rules are a  complete  code
         and that the exceptional circumstances  to  be  considered  in  the
         balancing exercise involve the  application  of  a  proportionality
         test as required by the Strasbourg jurisprudence...."

48.  It is accepted on the applicant's behalf that he does not satisfy  para
    399 or 399A of the Immigration  Rules.  However,  it  is  important  to
    understand the reason why he does not satisfy the requirements of these
    Rules.  The panel noted  that  it  was  accepted  before  it  that  the
    applicant did not satisfy para 399 or 399A for two reasons:  (i)  there
    was another family member, i.e. his wife, who was able to take care  of
    the applicant's British citizen children; and (ii)  the  applicant  did
    not satisfy the requirement  of  continuous  residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom discounting periods of imprisonment.

49.  It appears that the panel's attention was not drawn to  the  fact  that
    there was an even more important reason why paras 399 and 399A did  not
    apply, that is, that para 398(a) applied and for that reason paras  399
    and 399A could not apply. They could  not  have  applied  even  if  the
    applicant's British citizen children had not had anyone to take care of
    them and even if the applicant had satisfied the  continuous  residence
    requirement after discounting periods of residence.

50.  If there were an appeal, the FtT (IAC) would have to  take  account  of
    the fact that the legislature had decided that  the  state's  interests
    were deserving of such weight when considered against circumstances  of
    individuals that those who are caught by para 398(a) are not to benefit
    from para 399 or 399A. This is the context in which the  FtT  (IAC)  in
    any future appeal would have to decide whether  there  are  exceptional
    circumstances in this case that the public interest in  deportation  is
    outweighed. This is the context in which the FtT (IAC)  would  have  to
    consider the weight to be given to the impact  of  deportation  on  the
    applicant, his wife and children and the best interests of a child as a
    paramount consideration. The FtT (IAC) could  not  properly  place  the
    same weight on these factors as in a case that fell within para  398(b)
    or (c). To do so would be to  ignore  the  fact  that  the  legislature
    decided that individuals who received sentences of 4 years or more were
    not to have the benefit of para 399 or 399A.

51.  Furthermore, the FtT (IAC) would also be bound to take account  of  the
    fact that the actual sentence passed in this case was one of  7  years,
    considerably more than the minimum of 4 years for para 398(a) to apply.
    Again, this is a relevant fact in deciding the weight to  be  given  to
    the state's interests and whether it is outweighed by other factors.

52.  In relation to the certification issue, I reach  my  own  view  on  the
    question whether, on the material before the respondent as at the  date
    of the decision, the applicant's Article 8 claim was one that was bound
    to fail in an appeal before the FtT, applying the approach that the FtT
    would have to apply if there was an appeal and as explained  above.  In
    ZT (Kosovo) v SSHD [2009] 1 WLR 348, [2009] UKHL 6,  Lord  Phillips  of
    Worth Matravers explained the correct  approach  to  the  certification
    issue:

    "22. The test of whether a claim is 'clearly unfounded' is a black  and
         white test. The result cannot, for instance,  depend  upon  whether
         the burden of proof is on the claimant or the Secretary  of  State,
         ... in R(L) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department [2003]
         EWCA Civ 25; [2003] 1 WLR 1230, paragraphs 56  to  59  I  put  the
         matter as follows.


             '56   ...


             57    ... the decision-maker  will  (i)  consider  the  factual
             substance and detail of the claim, (ii) consider how it  stands
             with the known background data, (iii) consider whether  in  the
             round it is capable of belief, (iv) if  not,  consider  whether
             some part of it is capable of belief, (v) consider whether,  if
             eventually believed in whole or  in  part,  it  is  capable  of
             coming within the Convention. If the answers are such that  the
             claim cannot on any legitimate view succeed, then the claim  is
             clearly unfounded; if not, not.


             58    ... If on at least one legitimate view of  the  facts  or
             the law the claim may succeed, the claim will  not  be  clearly
             unfounded...'

    23.  Where, as here, there is no dispute of primary fact, the  question
         of whether or not a claim is clearly unfounded is only  susceptible
         to one rational answer.  If  any  reasonable  doubt  exists  as  to
         whether the claim may succeed then it is not clearly unfounded.  It
         follows that a challenge to the  Secretary  of  State's  conclusion
         that a claim is clearly unfounded is a rationality challenge. There
         is no way that a court can  consider  whether  her  conclusion  was
         rational other than by asking itself the same question that she has
         considered. If the court concludes that a  claim  has  a  realistic
         prospect of success when the  Secretary  of  State  has  reached  a
         contrary  view,  the  court  will  necessarily  conclude  that  the
         Secretary of State's view was irrational."

53.  I have no hesitation in rejecting  the  repeated  submission  in  Mr  �
    Ceallaigh's skeleton argument and at the hearing that the determination
    of the panel was "finely balanced".  There is nothing  at  all  in  the
    panel's reasoning to suggest this was the case. The words "we  consider
    that we would be totally failing in our duty  to  consider  the  public
    interest  and  need  to  express  deterrence  and  revulsion   at   the
    applicant's crimes" at [26] come nowhere near showing that the decision
    was considered by them to be finely balanced, whether  taken  on  their
    own or in conjunction with the rest of the panel's reasoning.

54.  Similarly, Mr � Ceallaigh placed much emphasis on his  submission  that
    the panel could have allowed the appeal without legal  error.  However,
    it does not make sense for me to consider whether the panel could  have
    allowed the appeal without legal error. The fact is that  it  dismissed
    the appeal at a time when it did not have the benefit of the  Court  of
    Appeal's guidance in MF (Nigeria) and, more importantly,  that  it  had
    not had drawn to it the significance of the fact that para 399 and 399A
    could not apply because para 398(a) applied. In any future appeal,  the
    FtT (IAC) will begin its assessment of whether  there  are  exceptional
    circumstances such as  to  outweigh  the  state's  interests  from  the
    correct starting point.

55.  The applicant's challenge to  the  certification  rests  on  four  main
    points, as follows:

     (i) the change in the risk of serious harm to the public from  high  to
         medium, there being no change in the risk of harm  to  his  partner
         and children which remained at medium. The change in the risk of re-
         offending from "low to medium" to "low" is based  on  post-decision
         evidence, as explained above;
     (ii)     more evidence of remorse; and
     (iii)    the increase in the length of his residence; and
     (iv)     the report of the social worker of the greater impact  on  his
         wife and children of his deportation.

56.  For the reasons given at [48]-[51]  above,  the  FtT  (IAC)  could  not
    properly give much weight to (ii), (iii) and (iv).

57.  However, even if I am wrong in my analysis at [48]-[51], the FtT  (IAC)
    could not properly give much weight to (ii), (iii)  and  (iv)  for  the
    following reasons:

     (a) On the issue of remorse, I agree with Ms Patry that the  panel  had
         before it evidence that the applicant was remorseful.   At  [7(a)],
         it  quoted  an  entire  paragraph  from  the  applicant's   witness
         statement in which he  expressed  his  remorse  and  explained  the
         reasons for his remorse.  At [7(b)],  it  recorded  the  claimant's
         oral evidence that he felt deeply regretful  about  committing  the
         offence.   At  [7(f)-(g)],  it  accepted  the   evidence   of   the
         applicant's wife that she considered the applicant to be a  changed
         man and that she had no worries or concerns that  he  would  commit
         any further criminal offences.  It  noted  her  evidence  that  she
         thought that the applicant was a different person since his release
         ("a massive, massive  change")  and  believed  he  had  learnt  his
         lesson.  At [22(c)], it panel stated that it was impressed  by  the
         evidence of the applicant's wife.  She struck  them  as  an  honest
         individual. When seen in the context of  the  evidence  of  remorse
         that the panel had, the new evidence of remorse adds little of  any
         significance to the applicant's side of the scales in the balancing
         exercise.

     (b) As to residence, FtT (IAC) could not properly  place  much  if  any
         weight on the increased residence  since  the  hearing  before  the
         panel, nor could it place much weight  on  the  overall  period  of
         residence even in a fresh re-evaluation. My calculations are  that,
         as at the date of the decision on 17 October 2013  and  discounting
         periods of imprisonment (as opposed to sentences  passed),  he  was
         just short of satisfying the 15-year period of continuous residence
         with valid leave for the purposes of  para  399(b)(i)  and  he  was
         short  by  over  4  years  of  satisfying  the  20-year  period  of
         continuous residence in para 399A(a).  In  relation  to  para  399,
         "near-misses" cannot be relied upon. He fell  short  of  satisfying
         the requirement in para 399A(a) by a long  margin.  The  FtT  (IAC)
         would be bound to take into account the fact that, in  April  2013,
         the panel had considered Maslov v Austria and found that there were
         serious reasons for the applicant's deportation.

     (c) As to the evidence concerning the impact on  the  applicant's  wife
         and children if the applicant were to be removed, Ms Jones  was  of
         the view that the applicant's removal would have a devastating  and
         detrimental effect on both of the children and that the applicant's
         wife would have major difficulties coping on her own.   Given  that
         she does not have any medical qualifications,  the  Tribunal  in  a
         future appeal could not properly place much if any  weight  on  her
         opinion that the  applicant's  wife  would  experience  depression.
         Furthermore, as Ms Patry correctly pointed out, there is nothing to
         indicate that Ms Jones had a  copy  of  the  determination  of  the
         panel.  The list of documents she referred to on the first page  of
         her report does not include the panel's determination.

         Ms Jones also does not appear to have taken into account  the  fact
         that the children  had  coped  during  the  applicant's  period  of
         incarceration in prison, although it is true to say that the impact
         of the applicant's removal following his return to the family  home
         is likely to be greater.  In addition, Ms Jones  has  not  assessed
         why D could not adapt once again to the removal of her father  from
         her life.  In relation to both children,  there  are  a  number  of
         generic comments about the effects that children might  face  if  a
         parent is removed from their lives.

         Similarly Ms Jones has  not  indicated  that  she  has  taken  into
         account  the  fact  that  the  applicant's  wife   did   cope   for
         considerable periods of time without the applicant.  Indeed,  there
         was evidence before the panel which heard the  appeal  only  a  few
         weeks before the report of Ms Jones.  Ms Jones does not  appear  to
         have taken into account the fact  that  the  applicant's  wife  had
         extensive support  available  to  her  during  the  period  of  the
         applicant's imprisonment.  In her witness statement that was before
         the panel, she said that her parents, sister, nephew and uncle  all
         live in the United Kingdom and that she would not be able  to  live
         in Jamaica because she  would  be  unable  to  cope  without  their
         support in a foreign land.

         Furthermore, the panel had  accepted  that  the  children  and  the
         applicant's wife would be affected by the applicant's removal.  The
         panel accepted that it was in the best interests  of  the  children
         for the applicant to remain with them in the United  Kingdom.   The
         panel accepted that deportation would result  in  the  break-up  of
         this family.  If there were another appeal, it is correct that  the
         FtT (IAC) would have to evaluate the Article 8 claim. Nevertheless,
         it would be bound to take into account the fact that it  was  found
         in the circumstances prevailing in  April  2013,  that  deportation
         with the consequence of a permanent break-up of this  family  would
         not in all the circumstances amount to a breach of Article 8.

58.  If there were another appeal, the FtT (IAC)  would  also  consider  the
    evidence as to the risk that the applicant poses.

59.  Ms Patry submitted that there was in fact no  change  in  the  risk  of
    serious harm to  the  public,  given  that  the  panel  had  found  the
    applicant's wife an honest individual and accepted the evidence that he
    was remorseful and was a changed man. On this basis, Ms Patry submitted
    that, although the OASys report stated that the risk of serious harm to
    the public was high, the panel had factored in the  evidence  that  the
    applicant was a changed man and that the risk of serious  harm  to  the
    public was lower than that stated in the OASys report as high.

60.  I do not accept Ms Patry's submission that the panel had accepted  that
    the risk of serious harm to the public was lower than as stated in  the
    OASys report. It is not possible to read [22(c)] of  the  determination
    in that way. When [22] and [23]  are  read  as  a  whole,  taking  into
    account in particular the final sentence of [22(d)], the panel did  not
    consider that the future risk of serious harm to the public had reduced
    on the evidence before them from the risk stated in the OASys report as
    high.

61.  Accordingly, the new evidence shows a reduction in the risk of  serious
    harm to the  public  from  "high"  to  "medium".  However,  this  still
    represents a significant risk.

62.  The risk of harm to the applicant's partner has not changed.

63.  There was no evidence as at the date of the decision that the  risk  of
    re-offending had reduced, as stated above. However, even if I am  wrong
    about this, the reduction in the risk of  re-offending  was  small  and
    insignificant.

64.  Considering the evidence as a whole and applying the  duty  of  anxious
    scrutiny, I have concluded that an appeal before the FtT (IAC) would be
    bound to fail. In balancing the state's interests arising from the risk
    posed by the applicant,  the  need  to  deter  foreign  nationals  from
    committing offences and the need  to  reflect  society's  revulsion  of
    serious crimes against (if, they fall to  be  considered,  contrary  to
    [48]-[51] above), the circumstances of  the  applicant  (including  his
    remorse, his increased residence, the overall period of  his  residence
    since his arrival at the age of 10 years) and the circumstances of  and
    impact upon his wife and children, the FtT  (IAC)  would  be  bound  to
    conclude  that  the  state's  interests  were  not  outweighed  by  the
    considerations  in  the  applicant's  favour  and  therefore  that  the
    applicant's deportation would not be in breach of article 8.

65.  I therefore uphold the certification under section 94(3)  of  the  2002
    Act.

The challenge to the lawfulness of the refusal  to  revoke  the  deportation
    order

66.  I have set out at [39]-[40]  above  a  summary  of  the  basis  of  the
    challenge. The first and obvious point is that the grounds relied  upon
    to support the challenge to the lawfulness of the decision  go  to  the
    merits of the article 8 case. The applicant will be able  to  ventilate
    the merits of his article 8 claim in an appeal to  the  FtT  (IAC),  an
    appeal which he can only bring once he has left the United Kingdom.

67.  I do not accept Mr � Ceallaigh's submission that an appeal to  the  FtT
    (IAC) is not an adequate alternative remedy. Given that I have taken my
    own view of the material that was before the respondent when  she  made
    the decision sought to be challenged and concluded that an appeal would
    be bound to fail,  an  appeal  brought  to  the  FtT  (IAC)  after  the
    applicant has left  the  United  Kingdom  is  an  adequate  alternative
    remedy.

68.  In any event, I do  not  accept  that  the  decision  letter  dated  17
    October 2013 is flawed in the public law sense, as contended. Whilst it
    is correct to say that the report of Ms. Jones is  mentioned  in  terms
    only at [13] and [16] and that the conclusion is set out  at  [18]  and
    [19] before the analysis which follows at [20]  onwards,  the  decision
    letter must be read as a whole. When read as a whole, it is plain  that
    the decision-maker considered that the new evidence of  the  impact  of
    the applicant's deportation on the applicant's wife  and  children  was
    not such as to outweigh the state's interests on any  legitimate  view.
    It is otherwise difficult to see why the decision-maker  discussed  the
    duty in section 55, the  Supreme  Court's  judgment  in  ZH  (Tanzania)
    [2011] UKSC 4 and the reasoning of the panel at [22(c)] in relation  to
    the best interests of the children.

69.  The decision-maker also considered the new evidence of  the  change  in
    risk, at [40]. There is nothing irrational in the  view  taken  by  the
    decision-maker that it was in the applicant's best interest  to  comply
    with the conditions of his release on licence.

70.  I therefore reject this ground.

Decision

     The claim is dismissed.

Signed                                  Date: 12 August 2014
Upper Tribunal Judge Gill


Postscript:   Section  19  of  the  Immigration  Act  2014  (the  2004  Act)
        introduced a new Part 5A of the 2002 Act with effect from  28  July
        2014. By then, I had already independently reached my view  of  the
        proper construction of para 398(a), 399 and 399A, as  expressed  at
        [48]-[51]. I had already decided to conduct the assessment  in  the
        alternative explained at [57] onwards,  notwithstanding  which  the
        applicant  failed  in  his  challenge  to  the  certification.    I
        therefore decided not to invite submissions from the parties on the
        implications for this judicial review  claim  of  the  coming  into
        force of section 19 of the 2014 Act.
