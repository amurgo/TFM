Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Fisher, of Counsel instructed by Messrs Duncan
                    Lewis & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms N Willocks-Briscoe, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant appeals with permission against a decision  of  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Watson who in a determination promulgated on 26
    October 2018 dismissed the appeal of  TK  against  a  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State to refuse to grant asylum made on 12 December 2017.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born  on  13  April  1987.   She
    entered Britain as a student in July 2013 having  leave  to  remain  in
    that capacity until September 2016.  In that month she  applied  for  a
    residence card as a dependant of her uncle  an  Italian  citizen  as  a
    dependent relative of an EEA national but that application was  refused
    in March 2017.  In June 2017 she applied for asylum.

3.   The appellant's claim is that she met a Pakistani man,  SU,  while  she
    was studying accountancy in  Lahore  in  2007.   They  had  kept  their
    relationship secret.  He came to Britain to study  in  2009.   In  2013
    when she arrived in Britain  they  had  started  living  together.   In
    September 2016 her uncle, SS, had started  living  in  the  same  house
    where she was living with SU. She shared a room with her uncle while SU
    lived in another room in the house.  After some months her uncle  found
    out about the relationship with SU, told her family  and  threats  were
    issued against her.  She also received threats from  a  cousin,  US  to
    whom she had  been  engaged  before  leaving  Pakistan  in  2013.   Her
    relationship with SU had broken down and she suffered  from  depression
    and attempted suicide.  She claimed that if returned  to  Pakistan  she
    would  either  commit  suicide  or  her  family  would  kill  her   for
    dishonouring them.

4.   The Secretary of State  did  not  find  the  appellant's  claim  to  be
    credible.  It was not accepted that she had been engaged to her cousin,
    US, and in any event should she not wish to return  to  her  home  area
    relocation would not be unduly harsh.

5.   The judge set out the appropriate standard of proof in paragraph  9  of
    the determination and then referred to the documentary  evidence  which
    included the application for leave to remain as a dependant of  SS  who
    was an EEA national.  SS had provided a letter stating that  they  were
    both living at 13B Upper Tooting Road and the appellant  was  dependent
    upon him. That application was refused and the appellant applied for JR
    of the decision. While that was pending she applied  for  asylum.   The
    appellant attended a screening interview on 13  June  2017.   She  said
    that she had had depression for two months and  was  taking  medication
    and had tried to commit suicide a week before.  She  said  her  parents
    were in Pakistan, her uncle would not talk to her and her boyfriend  of
    eight years had left her and that is why she wanted  to  kill  herself.
    She said that she lived with a friend and  had  one  paper  outstanding
    from her BSc course in accounting.  She stated she feared  her  parents
    would kill her as they had come to know about her relationship with SU.

6.   At her asylum interview in November 2017 she said  that  she  had  last
    had contact with her parents and brother in Pakistan in  June  2017  at
    the time of her suicide attempt her  many relatives who  had found  out
    she had had a relationship in Britain complained that  the  family  had
    been dishonoured and that she had no contact  with  them.   She  stated
    that when she  had  made  the  EEA  application  she  was  still  in  a
    relationship with SU and  he  said  that  they  could  go  to  Pakistan
    together and he would speak to her father and they could live  anywhere
    in Pakistan.  She told her father that she needed some  extra  time  to
    finish her studies.  The judge noted the evidence  of  the  appellant's
    mental health  which  included  a  care  plan  which  showed  that  the
    appellant had self-harmed in July 2017  and  described  her  as  having
    developed depression, becoming homeless after the end of  a  long  term
    relationship and reporting that her family had threatened her.  It said
    that she had an elevated suicide risk and it was  noted  that  she  had
    said that SU wanted to marry someone else and  that  her  family  would
    kill her if they knew.

7.   The judge also noted a letter from a psychiatrist  who  said  that  the
    appellant had a personality disorder and unstable relationships but had
    no plans to end her life although she could act impulsively.   She  had
    failed one exam and had recently moved.

8.    A  letter  dated  27  September  2018  addressed  to  the  appellant's
    solicitors from a mental  health  nurse  said  that  she  had  suicidal
    ideation but no current plans.  She was  on  medication  including  and
    antipsychotic.

9.   There is evidence that she had attended A&E after deliberately  banging
    her head in June 2017 and had stated that family  members  in  Pakistan
    had rejected her due to her relationship in Britain.

10.  A psychiatric report from Dr George was noted as well as  letters  from
    the appellant's father  containing  threats  telling  her  to  come  to
    Pakistan and get married and said that her  fianc�  was  waiting.   The
    letter detailed family members stating that they were all educated,  in
    positions of power in every  part  of  Pakistan  and  there  were  text
    messages from a cousin threatening the appellant's  life.   There  were
    also text messages to and from SU which the judge  said  were  entirely
    consistent with a disintegrating relationship.  There were also claimed
    threatening messages from the appellant's claimed fianc� in Pakistan.

11.  The judge noted the appellant's oral evidence as well as evidence  from
    SH, a special constable, who stated that when he met the appellant with
    SU and that it was clear that they were a couple.  He  had  never  seen
    the appellant's uncle but he was not too concerned about any threat  to
    the appellant from an uncle.

12.  A friend of the appellant also gave evidence about  the  appellant  and
    her relationship with her uncle.

13.  In paragraphs 26 onwards the judge set out her findings of  fact.   She
    noted the appellant's evidence which she stated was consistent with the
    appellant's family being of some wealth and a family to whom  education
    was important.  She noted that the appellant had come to Britain on her
    own at the age of 26 and was unmarried and found that the appellant had
    been allowed a great deal of freedom by her family who were fully aware
    of European life, her father having lived and worked in Europe  himself
    for four years.  She stated that she found that she could not  rely  on
    the claimed threatening letters from the  appellant's  father  and  the
    attacks from the claimed fianc�.  She considered that  those  documents
    were self-serving.  The appellant had claimed that  there  were  family
    members all over  Pakistan  who  were  in  the  police  force  but  the
    appellant had been unable to  name  them.  The  judge  noted  that  the
    letters had been sent to a flat to which the appellant  said  that  she
    had moved and the appellant had said that she had been telephoned to be
    told that the letters had arrived but that she had given no explanation
    as to who the people who telephoned her were.  The judge noted that  at
    one point the appellant had stated that she was living with SU  in  the
    shared house and that when her uncle arrived SU had simply moved  to  a
    different room in the house and she had shared a room  with  her  uncle
    with SU staying in the same house for several months.  The  judge  said
    that she found that totally unbelievable, particularly given  that  the
    uncle did not know that the appellant had been living with another  man
    who had effectively moved to a different room  in  the  house  for  six
    months after he had arrived.  The judge therefore stated that the  core
    account of the appellant was not credible in any way  and  stated  that
    she considered that against the background of a failed EEA application.
     The judge pointed out that the appellant's father is  a  man  who  had
    paid for her education in a city away from him and supported  both  her
    and her sister  in  obtaining  higher  qualifications.   She  had  been
    allowed to come to Britain at the age of 26  on  her  own.   The  judge
    found that the appellant was a woman who had had a genuine relationship
    with SU which had come to an end and that they had been acknowledged as
    a couple in the area where they lived and  that  the  relationship  had
    ended and the appellant was completely distraught about that  and  that
    that caused her to self-harm and come to the attention of  the  medical
    services after the ending of the relationship.  A further  incident  of
    self-harm had been precipitated when  SU  had  told  her  that  he  was
    planning to marry another person.  The judge stated that she found that
    the appellant had not shown she was engaged to  another  person  before
    coming to Britain and that the text messages or letters  from  Pakistan
    could not be relied on.  She rejected the appellant's account of having
    been supported by and living with her uncle in the same room  after  SU
    moved into the next door room at all times in a house shared with other
    men.  The judge found in paragraph 33 that:

         "I find she suffers from an unstable personality  disorder  as  our
         NHS consultant diagnoses, and moderate depression  which  is  as  a
         reaction to life events and in particular to the break  up  of  her
         relationship  with  SU.   She   has   self-harmed   by   inflicting
         superficial cuts to her arms and by headbanging.  She is at risk of
         further self-harm and of suicide but this cannot be quantified  and
         is unpredictable.  She has no intent at  the  date  of  the  expert
         report of Dr George."

14.  The  judge's  conclusions  were  set  out  in  paragraphs  34  onwards.
    Firstly she found that  the  appellant  had  not  shown  to  the  lower
    standard that she had received threats from her family as claimed.  She
    also discounted evidence of what  the  appellant  had  told  a  special
    constable, SH, who had also given evidence.

15.  The judge accepted that the appellant was worried  about  returning  to
    Pakistan.  She had not completed  her  course  and  had  had  a  failed
    relationship. The judge wrote:

         "I find that she is ashamed for herself in many ways and would find
         it hard to face her family.  This is a long way from  finding  that
         she is at a risk of harm from her family.  She is  educated  as  is
         her sister.  The family have lived in a city, funded by the  father
         who has  also  funded  all  aspects  of  the  education.   She  has
         travelled on her own to Europe and her father's personal experience
         of European culture and will  have  been  aware  of  what  she  was
         travelling to.  All this is not consistent  with  a  profile  of  a
         person at risk of honour killing in  accordance  with  the  country
         guidance information."

16.  The judge stated, moreover, that if she were wrong in  her  finding  on
    that point and as she accepted that honour killing was a clear risk  in
    some part of the Pakistani community she should consider the issues  of
    sufficiency of protection and internal relocation.

17.  The judge referred to a functioning police force  and  that  there  was
    progress in the prevention of anti-woman  practices.  She  pointed  out
    that the appellant had been living a reasonably independent life  in  a
    foreign country and was a person who would  be  able  to  approach  the
    police for assistance.  The judge had noted that the appellant had said
    that she would be able to complete her qualifications in  Pakistan  and
    had given evidence that she could do so.  The appellant had  also  been
    considering returning voluntarily when her student visa ran out but had
    decided to try and apply for the EEA visa instead.  The judge  rejected
    the appellant's claim that her cousin US has power  and  influence  and
    that he was well-known for murdering people. That was not supported  by
    any documentary evidence. She concluded  that  the  appellant  had  not
    shown to the lower standard that  either  her  claimed  cousin  or  her
    father would be able to locate her if  she  chose  to  relocate  within
    Pakistan.  Given the appellant's age, skills and  education  the  judge
    considered she would be able to relocate to a large  city.   The  judge
    also referred to a report by a Dr Holden but stated there  was  nothing
    therein to depart from the country guidance.   The  appellant  had  not
    shown that there were well-connected family members who would  be  able
    to trace her.

18.  With regard to the issue of  suicide  risk  the  judge  noted  that  Dr
    George had assessed her depression as moderate and could not quantify a
    suicide risk but said that her medication treatment were available  set
    out in the refusal letter though other therapy might not  be  available
    in remote areas of Pakistan the appellant the judge had the  option  of
    returning to her own city or relocating to an urban area and  treatment
    would be available.  The  judge  said  that  the  appellant's  previous
    attempt at self-harm be noted as superficial but there was  clearly  at
    risk of self-harm which it was suggested in the reports was related  to
    her immigration status.  The judge stated that  it  was  also  accepted
    that the breakdown  of  a  longstanding  relationship  had  caused  her
    immense pain and stated that the psychiatric report  did  not  conclude
    that there was a high risk of her committing suicide and  that  removal
    of the appellant did not breach Article 3.

19.  The grounds of appeal argue  that  the  judge  had  made  a  number  of
    factual errors in stating that the appellant had only  made  her  claim
    because she had failed to  obtain  status  in  Britain  -  the  grounds
    asserted that by that stage the appellant had already told her GP  that
    her family would  kill  her  and  in  any  event  the  appellant's  EEA
    application was still being litigated.  Moreover,  they argued that the
    judge had been wrong to state that the appellant could have blocked the
    number from which messages from the fianc� her family had arranged  for
    her in Pakistan was being sent stating that this was not a point raised
    by the respondent and that WhatsApp pictures were  not  stored  by  the
    person receiving the message but were created by  the  sender   at  the
    start of the message.  The suggestion that messages could  be  arranged
    to bolster a claim did not demonstrate there was no  reasonable  degree
    of likelihood that they were genuine.  The grounds also stated that the
    judge was wrong to assert that  the  appellant  had  been  inconsistent
    about where she had stayed.   It  was  accepted  that  the  appellant's
    witness  had  poor  recollection.   The  appellant  had   always   been
    consistent about where she lived and the judge had erred by stating the
    appellant had been moved to a different address by the Home Office.

20.  It was also claimed that the judge  had  failed  to  consider  evidence
    stating that the appellant had told Mr H of her arranged  marriage  and
    she had told the other supporting witness of this and that when she had
    found at a railway station stating she wished to jump under a train she
    told paramedics she was the victim of threats to kill from her  family.
    Moreover it  appeared  that  she  had  made  a  report  to  police  and
    consistently  reported  to  health  professionals  that  she  is  being
    threatened by her family.

21.  It is  also  asserted  that  the  judge  had  failed  to  consider  the
    background evidence relating to arranged marriages and honour  killings
    and stated that the judge had not properly considered the expert report
    of Dr Holden.

22.  Finally it was argued that the judge had not  properly  considered  the
    appellant's risk of suicide particularly referring to the opinion of Dr
    George that her illness had entered a chronic phase.

23.  At the hearing of the appeal before me Ms Fisher relied on the  grounds
    of appeal asserting that the judge  had  not  properly  considered  the
    medical report nor the evidence that the appellant had told the general
    practitioner about the arranged marriage and  that  that  rebutted  the
    judge's allegations that the appellant had fabricated her claim.    She
    referred to the communications from the appellant's claimed fianc�  and
    had stated the fact that messages could bolster a claim  did  not  mean
    that they were not  genuine.   She  stated  that  with  regard  to  the
    addresses  that  the  witnesses  had  been  inconsistent  and  not  the
    appellant.  She  stated  that  all  conflicts  of  evidence  should  be
    resolved in the appellant's favour and argued that the  judge  was  not
    entitled to consider that the appellant's break up with US  had  caused
    the breakdown rather than being caused by her being threatened  by  her
    family.  Moreover she said that the appellant had reported the incident
    to Mr H and  asserted  that  the  judge  had  not  considered  all  the
    evidence.  She stated that the analysis of  the  medical  evidence  was
    cursory and the judge should not have  placed  weight  on  the  country
    guidance case of SM and MH (Pakistan) CG [2012] UKUT 00067 (IAC).   She
    referred to the case of KA and Others (Pakistan)  CG  [2010]  UKUT  216
    (IAC) stating that the judge should have considered the  issues  before
    her on the particular facts of the appellant and had erred by making no
    reference to the appellant's mental health  considering  the  issue  of
    relocation.  It was  asserted  that  the  judge  had  not  made  proper
    reference to the documentation including a  psychiatric  report  and  a
    report from the consultant and had not placed weight on  the  fact  the
    appellant had self harmed on two occasions.  She argued that the  judge
    had not applied the guidance in the case of J [2005] EWCA  Civ  69  and
    had failed to have regard to the expert evidence.

24.  In replying Ms Willocks-Briscoe pointed out that the judge was  correct
    to find that the EEA application had been refused  in  March  2017  but
    that it was not until the following month that the appellant had raised
    the issue of her fears of returning to Pakistan with the  Home  Office.
    She argued that the judge was correct to find that  the  appellant  had
    fabricated  her  story  and  had  given  adequate   reasons   for   her
    conclusions.  The judge had properly considered the issues  surrounding
    the various addresses at which the appellant had lived and was entirely
    entitled to conclude that the  letters  were  created  to  bolster  the
    appellant's claim.  She stated that the evidence that the appellant had
    been moved by the Home Office had come  from  letter  from  the  Ilford
    Medical Centre and therefore the  judge  was  entitled  to  reach  that
    conclusion.  In any event that was not material.  With  regard  to  the
    judge's treatment of the appellant's mental health. Clearly, the  judge
    was aware of all the background documentation which she set out in some
    detail and her conclusions thereon were fully open to her.   The  judge
    had accepted that the appellant's  conditions  were  diagnosed  by  NHS
    professionals and had obviously engaged with Dr George's  report.   The
    judge had looked at the evidence, found inconsistencies therein and was
    entitled to reach the conclusion which she did.  Moreover the judge had
    clearly considered the expert report which did not add anything to  the
    appellant's claim.  Indeed the expert's report should not see  anything
    different from the country guidance case on which the judge relied.

Discussion

25.  I consider there is no material error of law in  the  determination  of
    the Judge.  The judge correctly stated that this appellant comes from a
    prosperous family where her father had funded her education and  indeed
    her living away from home both in Lahore and in Britain.  Moreover  the
    appellant was aged 26 when she came to Britain and of course is now 31.
    It must clearly be the case that if her father  wished  to  "marry  her
    off" to a cousin he would surely  have  done  so  before  she  came  to
    Britain, let alone the fact that a fianc� so much older than she   (she
    has asserted that her claimed fianc� is up to  20  years  older)  would
    accept that she would be  leaving to study abroad for some years.  That
    is the context in which the judge correctly considered the  appellant's
    claim.

26.   The  grounds  of  appeal  on  which  Ms  Fisher  relied  are,  if  not
    disingenuous, very largely merely a disagreement  with  findings  which
    the judge was fully entitled to make on the evidence before her.    The
    judge was correct to state that the appellant made her claim  when  she
    had failed to obtain status in Britain.  The fact that she said to  her
    GP "that her family would kill her" is not a "claim" made to  the  Home
    Office for asylum and her application to remain under  the  Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations had been  refused.   Moreover,  with  regard  to  the
    communications from the appellant's family the judge was entitled to be
    sceptical of the letters received given the context of  the  fact  that
    her father was prepared to  fund  his  daughter's  studies  in  Britain
    despite her being aged 26 and would go on funding her studies  here  if
    he felt that she should return to marry a fianc� who was so much  older
    than her.

27.   Moreover  the  judge  was  entitled  to  consider  that   there   were
    inconsistencies regarding the appellant's address after  she  had  left
    the house where she was living with SU as the  judge  was  entitled  to
    place weight on what  the  appellant's  witnesses  said.   It  is  also
    correct as Ms Willocks-Briscoe  pointed  out  that  the  issue  of  the
    appellant being moved by the Home Office was an issue that  was  raised
    by the health centre and therefore the judge was entitled to place some
    weight on that.  Be that as it may the reality is that the  appellant's
    claim that her uncle moved into a room with her  in  the  shared  house
    where  SU, who  had been sharing her room moved to  another  room,  but
    the uncle did not become aware of this for six  months  is  implausible
    particularly given that the house was shared by various people  and  as
    SH stated the appellant and SU were known as a couple in Tooting.

28.  There is nothing to show that the judge did not properly  consider  the
    evidence.  While both SH and the appellant's other witness referred  to
    the arranged marriage in  or  around  2014  that  of  itself  does  not
    indicate that the appellant was being forced into an arranged marriage.
     It is inconsistent that the appellant's father would have paid for her
    to come to Britain to study at a time when he was forcing her  into  an
    arranged marriage and angry that she did  not  return  to  Pakistan  to
    marry.

29.  It is simply not correct that the judge  did  not  consider  background
    evidence.  She properly considered the relevant country  guidance  case
    as well as the report of Dr Holden  but  properly  concluded  that  she
    should take into account the appellant's particular circumstances  when
    considering the likelihood of an honour killing or the ability  of  the
    appellant to relocate should she wish to.  The  judge's  findings  were
    made having taken into account all the evidence, including the  medical
    evidence and she reached findings and conclusions which were fully open
    to her on the evidence.

30.  The judge was correct to consider the  issues  of  internal  relocation
    and protection even though she had found that  the  appellant  was  not
    credible, and she was correct to apply the relevant  country  guidance.
    It would have been an error for her not to do so.  The  judge  properly
    considered the issue of suicide risk  and  referring  to  the  relevant
    medical reports and reached conclusions thereon which were open to her.
     Moreover, she clearly had those reports in mind when  considering  the
    issue of internal relocation - which is only relevant of course  should
    the appellant decide that she did not wish to return to her family.

31.  For these reasons I find there is no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    determination of the Judge and that her decision to dismiss this appeal
    shall stand.


Notice of Decision
The appeal is dismissed.
