                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Introduction: the decision under appeal

    1. The appellants are citizens  of  Pakistan  who  appeal  against  the
       determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Sweet promulgated  on  30
       August 2012 dismissing their appeals against the  decisions  of  the
       Secretary of State made on 27  and  29  March  2012  refusing  their
       applications for further leave to remain in the United Kingdom.


    2. The basis for refusal is said to be derived from  paragraph  322  of
       the Immigration Rules which contains grounds on which the refusal of
       leave to remain or variation of leave to enter or remain  is,  on  a
       mandatory basis, to be refused:


         The fact that variation of leave to enter or remain is being sought
         for a purpose not covered by these Rules

Immigration history

    3.  The first-named appellant ("the appellant") arrived in  the  United
       Kingdom on 12 April 2002.   His application for asylum  was  refused
       on 11 June 2002  and  the  appeal  dismissed  on  21  January  2003.
       Although  an  application  for   judicial   review   followed,   the
       application was refused at the  permission  stage.  Thereafter,  the
       applicant made further submissions in the  form  of  a  fresh  claim
       which were  refused  on  17  February  2006.  However,  yet  further
       submissions were made, at which point,  on  21  December  2006,  the
       appellant was acknowledged as a refugee and granted leave to  remain
       in that capacity until 20 December 2011.  The appellant subsequently
       stated that his claim for refugee status was based on his  being  an
       Ahmadi.  In due course, his wife entered the United Kingdom in  July
       2009 and was granted leave to remain roughly in line  with  that  of
       her husband until October 2011. The third appellant was born in  the
       United Kingdom on 7 April 2011.  All then applied for settlement  on
       the basis of the expiry of their  previous  grants  of  leave.   The
       couple now have two children.  None is a British citizen.

The facts

    4. It is common ground that the grant made in favour of  the  appellant
       on 21 December 2006 was the result of the fraudulent activity of  Ms
       Ali, an Executive Officer employed by UKBA.  She  was  convicted  of
       falsely processing 49 or 50  applications  for  leave  to  enter  or
       remain in the United Kingdom, of which the  appellant's  application
       was one. Mr Richard Jeal, a Higher Executive Officer,  investigating
       Ms Ali's activities, which included  the  grant  of  asylum  to  the
       appellant, produced internal records within the UKBA  purporting  to
       show the approval of Mr Tony Fahy, Ms Ali's  superior.  However,  he
       subsequently made a statement  for  the  purposes  of  the  criminal
       prosecution  that  he  had  neither  discussed  nor   approved   the
       appellant's application and  the  signature  purporting  to  be  his
       approval was a forgery. As a result, Ms Ali was charged with  wilful
       misconduct in a public office. In due course she was sentenced to  5
       years imprisonment on her  guilty  plea.  Her  activities  were  the
       effective means by which the grant of status was made  to  nationals
       from Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan. The fact that  the
       beneficiaries of her fraudulent activity were drawn from a disparate
       group of applicants,  none  of  whom  apparently  knew  each  other,
       suggests that Ms Ali was not acting at  the  behest  of  friends  or
       family. Ms Ali did not carry  out  these  activities  for  financial
       gain.  In particular, there was no evidence this appellant  paid  Ms
       Ali for the favour.


    5. Tariq Mahmood, although mentioned in passing in the criminal  papers
       as an individual who benefited from Ms  Ali's  activities,  was  not
       charged with any involvement in Ms Ali's wrongdoing. Nor, as far  as
       I am aware, were any of the other 49 or 50  other  beneficiaries  of
       her activities.  No  attempt  was  made  to  revoke  or  cancel  the
       immigration status granted to him by reason of Ms Ali's  activities.
       In his sentencing remarks, the Judge made no suggestion that Ms  Ali
       knew the beneficiaries of her actions.  Mr Jeal did not  suggest  in
       his evidence that they had colluded with Ms Ali. In the  grounds  of
       appeal to the Upper Tribunal, the appellant  expressly  relied  upon
       the sentencing remarks of HHJ Downing in which, addressing  Ms  Ali,
       he stated:


         "You as it were single-handedly decided that you would embark on  a
         course of action that would enable people to evade the rules."


    6. In support of his appeal, the appellant called Mr Jeal,  the  Higher
       Executive Officer  employed  by  the  Home  Office  responsible  for
       investigating Ms Ali's activities who confirmed that Ms Ali  pleaded
       guilty to Count 1 on the indictment which had referred to the  grant
       of leave to remain in favour of the appellant in 2006. Mr  Jeal  was
       unable to provide any evidence of  deception  on  the  part  of  the
       appellant.  His statement made no reference to his claim being based
       on false documentation or that it was fraudulent. He confirmed  that
       the files were no longer available but false minutes created  by  Ms
       Ali were traceable.

The Judge's findings: the error of law

    7. Notwithstanding this evidence,  Judge  Sweet  (having  recorded  the
       appellant's oral evidence that he did not  know  Ms  Ali,  that  the
       appeal hearing was the first occasion that he  had  heard  her  name
       mentioned and that he had never been approached by anyone  regarding
       Ms Ali) rejected  the  appellant's  evidence  as  not  credible.  He
       expressed his opinion that he had "no doubt whatsoever that he  knew
       that his asylum claim was not validly granted". This finding was not
       open to the Judge on the material before him, and certainly  not  on
       the criminal standard.  It could only be  predicated  on  a  finding
       that the appellant knew that there was a fraudster  working  in  the
       Home Office, a finding which is not supported by the evidence.  Even
       if the appellant had suspected that it was the result of mistake  or
       error, the Judge did  not  explore  what  was  the  effect  of  this
       finding; perhaps very little.   It had  not  been  the  respondent's
       case that the appellant was implicated in the fraud.   There  is  no
       suggestion that the fresh submissions made by  him  were  fraudulent
       and that he knew them to be so  (or  that  Ms  Ali  did).  In  these
       circumstances, the error of the Judge amounted  to  an  error  on  a
       point of law requiring me to re-make the decision  on  the  material
       available to me. The evidence does not permit me  to  approach  this
       case on the basis that the  appellant  was  complicit  in  a  fraud.
       Rather, I must approach the appeal on the basis that he was innocent
       of wrongdoing in the grant to him of leave to remain.

The procedural history and the decision to proceed with the hearing

    8. In granting permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal,  the  First-
       tier Tribunal Judge relied principally upon the Judge's approach  to
       Article 8, but he expressly stated that all grounds  were  arguable,
       including those in relation to paragraph 332 and invalidity.

    9. When the matter came before me on 4 January 2003 in  which  Mr  Nath
       appeared on behalf  on  the  respondent,  it  was  accepted  by  the
       respondent and there was no  evidence  before  the  Judge  that  the
       appellant was himself implicated in a fraud perpetrated by Ms Ali. I
       recited that the fraud was in the nature of the grant  of  leave  to
       remain by the  respondent  to  the  appellant  on  the  basis  of  a
       purported decision made by Mr Tony Fahy on 21 December 2006 when  no
       such decision had been made by him and the entry to that effect  was
       forged by Ms Ali.  In the recitals of my directions  I  also  stated
       that the documentation produced by the respondent and  sent  to  the
       appellant as a result of the fraud was genuine on its face, save for
       the effect if  any  of  the  fraud.   I  noted  the  fact  that  the
       respondent had not  taken  steps  to  revoke  cancel  or  annul  the
       previous grant of leave to remain.  I directed  that  the  appellant
       had until 1 February 2013 to file and serve written  submissions  as
       to the validity of the grant of leave to remain  with  reference  to
       the relevant legal authorities. In  particular,  the  appellant  was
       invited to make submissions (a) as to whether the grant was void  or
       voidable and, if voidable, whether it had been  avoided  and/or  (b)
       whether the grant of leave to remain (though  irregularly  processed
       by the respondent) was nevertheless the grant of leave to remain for
       the appellant  in  recognition  of  his  being  a  refugee.  I  gave
       directions that the respondent had 28 days in which  to  respond.  I
       acknowledged the  potential  significance  of  this  appeal  to  the
       respondent by granting her liberty to apply for an extension of time
       if the Treasury's Solicitor's advice was sought. The respondent  was
       also at liberty  to  apply  to  adduce  evidence  of  fraud  on  the
       appellant's part subject, of course, to the appellant being given  a
       right of response.


   10. These directions were provided in writing but were also discussed at
       the hearing on 4 January 2013. I do not, however,  suggest  that  at
       the hearing that I formulated precise dates as they  appear  in  the
       written directions.  I accept from Mr Nath that he expected  written
       directions to arrive in due course.


   11. I subsequently gave further directions on 16 May 2013 for the filing
       and service of comprehensive bundles to be carried out by both sides
       within 21 days from the order, permitting ample time for  compliance
       by the date of the hearing set for 24 June 2013.


   12. In compliance with my  directions,  the  appellant's  representative
       provided written submissions (page 13  of  the  appellant's  bundle)
       which made reference to ex parte Ku and others and  ex  parte  Chan,
       see below.


   13. At the hearing before me, Mr Nath told me that he had  not  received
       either  the  directions  of  4  January  2013  or  the   appellant's
       submissions served and filed in response to them.  I accept from him
       that they are not to be found in  the  Home  Office  file.   I  also
       acknowledge that the pro forma covering letter  which  is  routinely
       sent out with directions by the Tribunal is not  on  the  Tribunal's
       file.  However, it is more likely than  not  that  one  was  created
       because at page 4 of the appellant's bundle, there is a copy of  the
       letter dated 8 January 2013 which was received by the appellant (and
       which is addressed 'to the appellant and the respondent') containing
       the directions  with  which  the  appellant  has  complied.   It  is
       unlikely the Tribunal intentionally omitted to serve the  respondent
       but mistakes can, of course, happen.


   14.  I  also  accept  that  the  Tribunal  was  served  with   counsel's
       submissions on the validity point which the Tribunal received  under
       cover of a letter dated 31 January 2013 (page 11 of the  appellant's
       bundle).  I am unable to say whether the respondent was so served.


   15. Mr Nath sought an adjournment to respond to the submissions.  Whilst
       I understand his wish to do so, I refused the adjournment.  Mr Nath,
       albeit in general terms, has known of  the  course  on  which  these
       appeals were heading since 4 January 2013  and  of  a  hearing  date
       since 16 May 2013.  He accepts that he received the  directions  for
       the service of  comprehensive  bundles  along  with  the  notice  of
       hearing.  He could have approached the appellant's representative or
       the Tribunal since he must have foreseen the need to deal  with  the
       appellant's submissions prior to the hearing.


   16. Further, I am satisfied, for the reasons that follow, that the legal
       position is  clear  and  my  understanding  of  the  relevant  legal
       principles is sufficient to dispose of this appeal without the  need
       for further submissions from  the  respondent.   If  the  respondent
       wishes  to  challenge  the  legal  principles,  there  is  a   route
       elsewhere.

The innocent holder

   17. The problem raised by this appeal was identified but not resolved in
       R v SSHD, ex parte Khawaja [1984] AC 74; [1983] 2 WLR. 321; [1983] 1
       All ER 765, HL(E) in which Lord Bridge of Harwich said at p. 119:

         "Finally I would wish  to  leave  for  consideration  on  a  future
         occasion the difficult questions which  may  arise  when  leave  to
         enter has been obtained by the fraud of  a  third  party,  but  the
         person entering had no knowledge of the fraud. I am  not  convinced
         that R v SSHD, Ex parte Khan [1977] 1 W.L.R. 1466 ,  where  it  was
         held that the innocent wife who obtained leave to enter on a  false
         passport procured for her by her husband was  an  illegal  entrant,
         was rightly decided."

R v Immigration Officer, ex parte Chan

   18. In R v Immigration Officer, ex parte Chan [1992] 1 W.L.R. 541 [1992]
       2 All ER 738 the entrant, whose home was in Hong  Kong,  obtained  a
       work permit from a friend in return for the payment of  the  sum  of
       �2,000. (This was,  in  itself,  an  indication  that  he  knew  the
       transaction was fraudulent.)  He then came  to  the  United  Kingdom
       with his Hong Kong passport and the work permit which  purported  to
       be valid for three years. He was given leave to enter but two months
       later was arrested as an illegal entrant. The reasoning of Neill and
       Leggatt LLJ was that the entry was illegal, not  because  there  had
       been through the innocent agency of the entrant  a  fraud  practised
       upon the immigration officer but because a material  document  which
       the entrant had been required to produce to the immigration  officer
       had not been a valid document. It  was  an  essential  part  of  the
       reasoning that the document could properly be described  as  invalid
       notwithstanding the fact that the entrant  was  not  aware  of  that
       fact. It appears to have been accepted by the court that  there  had
       been fraud, albeit by someone other than the  entrant  himself,  and
       that, but for that fraud, Mr. Chan would not have been  given  leave
       to enter.


   19. On his renewed application for  leave  to  apply  for  the  judicial
       review before the Court of Appeal, Neill  L.J.  described  the  work
       permit as follows:


         "It is now plain that the work permit was issued improperly  by  an
         officer in the Department of Employment who has now been dismissed.
         Inquiries have established that the file No. 9029730 (the reference
         number on the face of the work permit produced  by  the  applicant)
         cannot be traced and almost certainly never  came  into  existence.
         Accordingly it seems clear that  there  never  was  any  supporting
         documentation for the issue of the work permit. For the purpose  of
         the present proceedings it is accepted on behalf of  the  Secretary
         of State that the applicant had no knowledge that the  work  permit
         which he produced to the immigration officer  had  been  improperly
         issued. The question which arises is whether he is nevertheless  an
         illegal  entrant  within  the  meaning  of  section  33(1)  of  the
         Immigration Act  1971  notwithstanding  that  he  had  no  personal
         knowledge of the invalidity of the work permit in his possession."


   20. On the basis of these findings that the  work  permit  was  invalid,
       Nield LJ considered the consequences:


         I am satisfied, however, that the obligation imposed  by  paragraph
         4(2)(b) to produce other documents 'specified  by  the  immigration
         officer' requires, certainly in the case of a document  such  as  a
         work permit, that the document should be genuine. A work permit  is
         clearly a material document both  for  the  purposes  of  obtaining
         leave to enter and for the purpose of determining the conditions of
         such leave. In this context I can see  no  satisfactory  basis  for
         distinguishing between an invalid  passport  and  an  invalid  work
         permit. It follows therefore, on the authority of the  decision  in
         ex parte Khan [1977] 1 WLR. 1466 that if leave to enter is given on
         the basis of a work permit which  later  proves  to  be  false  the
         entrant does not enter the United Kingdom with leave to do  so  'in
         accordance with' the Act of 1971. Moreover, it is  clear  that  the
         immigration officer would have refused the applicant leave to enter
         had he known of the invalidity of the work permit at  the  time  of
         entry...."

R v SSHD, ex parte Ku and others

   21. In R v SSHD, ex parte Ku and others [1995] 2 W.L.R. 589, [1995] Q.B.
       364 (Sir Thomas Bingham M.R., Hobhouse and Morritt L.JJ), the  Court
       of Appeal was concerned with exactly similar documents  because  the
       court was told that the same official referred to in ex  parte  Chan
       was responsible for the provision of documentation in  ex  parte  Ku
       and  others.   On  their  face,  therefore,  the  two   cases   were
       indistinguishable. However, the gloss placed upon  those  facts  was
       subtly different.

   22. Between May 1990 and February  1991  the  Department  of  Employment
       employed in its overseas labour section an official, since dismissed
       but who has  never  been  named,  who  in  breach  of  the  internal
       procedures of the department is said to have issued, or caused to be
       issued, a considerable number of work permits which  the  department
       says he should never have issued. He  either  did  not  keep  proper
       records of the relevant applications or he destroyed  those  records
       before he left the  department.  It  appears  that  he  ignored  the
       departmental requirement  that  at  least  two  officers  should  be
       involved in each case and that the processing  and  approval  stages
       should be carried out  by  different  people.  His  activities  were
       described in these terms by Laws J.:


         "[He] is regarded as having knowingly  and  deliberately  issued  a
         large number of work permits  improperly  and  in  an  unauthorised
         manner, and beyond the powers granted to him by the department."


       It appears  that,  had  there  been  a  proper  examination  of  the
       applications, the  applications  would  have  been  refused  as  not
       meeting the skills  and  experience  criteria  and  because  it  was
       contrary to departmental practice to issue more than one permit  for
       a chef in respect of an establishment of the size in question.


   23. The applicants in ex parte Ku and others,  citizens  of  Hong  Kong,
       were given leave to enter the United Kingdom on production of  their
       passports  and  work  permits  which  had  been  obtained  from  the
       Department of Employment by their prospective employer. Each  permit
       was in proper form and was authenticated by the departmental  stamp.
       None contained false  information  or  was  a  forgery.  Unlike  the
       position in ex parte Chan, it was accepted that  both  the  employer
       and  the  applicants  had  acted  in  good  faith  in   making   the
       applications. In fact, the permits had been issued  by  an  official
       acting contrary to departmental instructions. When it was discovered
       that they had been improperly issued  an  immigration  officer  gave
       each applicant notice of intention to remove  him  from  the  United
       Kingdom on  the  ground  that  he  had  entered  in  breach  of  the
       immigration laws, contrary to s. 3(1) of the  Immigration  Act  1971
       and was accordingly an illegal entrant, as defined by s.  33(1).  In
       proceedings for judicial review  the  applicants  sought  orders  of
       certiorari to quash the  immigration  officers'  decisions.  Laws  J
       dismissed the applications.


   24. Their work permits were all in similar terms.  The  employer's  name
       was provided. On each the occupation was said to be "Chef"  and  the
       salary or remuneration was set out. The permits were in  the  proper
       form and were properly numbered E151975, E152057 and  E152058.  They
       were printed on  the  department's  form  "OW2"  which  incorporated
       security printing. They were authenticated with  the  stamp  of  the
       department. They had been issued by  the  department  and  were  not
       forged.

   25. The three were interviewed and each was served with a  notice  which
       stated:

         "I have considered all of the information available to me and I  am
         satisfied that you are an illegal entrant as defined in s. 33(1) of
         the Immigration Act 1971 . You are therefore a person who is liable
         to be detained pending the completion of arrangements  for  dealing
         with you under the Act. I  propose  to  give  directions  for  your
         removal from the United Kingdom in due course and details  will  be
         given to you separately."


   26. At the same time, each was given temporary admission but as a person
       who was liable to be detained.  Further, s. 26(1)(c) of the 1971 Act
       rendered it a criminal offence to make to an immigration  officer  a
       statement or representation which that persons knows to be false  or
       does not believe to be true.

   27. The applicants appealed on grounds  that  (1)  leave  to  enter  the
       United Kingdom was  obtained  on  production  of  a  valid  passport
       without any fraud or  misrepresentation  as  to  the  facts  by  the
       applicant or any agent of his concerned to promote  his  entry;  (2)
       the fact that an official in the Department of Employment issued the
       work  permit,  which  had  been  duly  applied  for,  in  breach  of
       departmental procedures, did not render it a nullity in  respect  of
       the person who relied on its  having  been  issued  with  ostensible
       authority and was unaware of any defect in  it;  (3)  the  entrant's
       duty to provide a valid passport and such other documents  as  might
       be required of him was not breached where he produced a current work
       permit issued with ostensible authority; no decision had been  taken
       by the department to denounce, revoke  or  cancel  the  permit;  (4)
       although Nicholas Blake Q.C. argued that the correctness  of  Khan's
       case was a matter for the House of Lords, the court was not bound by
       R v SSHD, ex parte Khan because there the  relevant  documents  were
       assumed to be invalid without any argument as to the basis  of  that
       invalidity.

   28. Their appeals were allowed since the work permits,  although  issued
       in  breach  of  departmental  procedures  by  an   official   acting
       improperly, were not forgeries and contained no misstatements.  They
       were not invalid.  The Court of Appeal was not  bound  by  ex  parte
       Chan to hold that the permits in the present case  were  invalid  in
       the sense which the Court of Appeal in Chan's case were  using  that
       word. Accordingly, the applicants had not entered the United Kingdom
       in breach of the immigration laws,  nor  were  they  illegal.  Their
       appeals were allowed and the decisions of the  immigration  officers
       that the applicants were illegal entrants were quashed.


   29. Hobhouse LJ in distinguishing ex parte Chan reopened  the  issue  of
       invalidity.

         We are bound by the decision in ex parte Chan, but only by what  it
         decided. That case was expressly decided upon the  basis  that  the
         work permit with which the court was concerned was  invalid:  entry
         pursuant to leave  obtained  by  the  presentation  of  an  invalid
         document was unlawful entry. In the present case the entry  permits
         cannot be described as invalid. We have been told that the official
         who was responsible for their issue was the same  as  the  official
         referred to in the Chan case. But they were nevertheless  documents
         which had been issued  out  of  the  department  stamped  with  the
         official stamp of the department. The only  point  upon  which  the
         minister can rely is that the official in the department who caused
         them to be issued should not have done so and must have known  that
         he was acting improperly. The permits were not  forged.  They  were
         what they purported to be - work permits issued by the  department.
         They did not contain  any  false  statement:  the  "particulars  of
         permit  holder"  were  correct  as   were   the   "particulars   of
         employment." It cannot be said of  these  permits  that  (to  quote
         Neill L.J., at p. 551) they contained "false information." What can
         be said is that they should not have been issued by the  department
         official and that  if  the  immigration  officer  had,  as  he  was
         entitled to, investigated  the  position  before  giving  leave  to
         enter, he would have ascertained that,  applying  the  departmental
         criteria as set out in the department's guidance leaflets  OW5  and
         OW1B, leave to enter should not  be  given  and  that  the  permits
         should  not  have  been  issued.  The  permits  specifically,   and
         accurately, stated that they did not constitute any obligation upon
         the immigration officer to give  the  holder  leave  to  enter  the
         United Kingdom. The work permits  were  inappropriate  rather  than
         invalid... These cases are therefore materially different from what
         was assumed to be the situation in Ex parte Chan.


         It  has  been  argued  on  behalf  of  the  minister  that  we  are
         nevertheless bound by Ex parte Chan to hold that the  work  permits
         in the present case were invalid. This is not correct.  A  case  is
         only authority for the decision  of  law  it  contains,  its  ratio
         decidendi. If the relevant decision is a decision on  a  matter  of
         fact, a  different  court  is  at  liberty  to  reach  a  different
         decision. If the relevant question was assumed, it is not  part  of
         the decision in that case and another court is not  bound  to  make
         the same assumption. Both these qualifications of what  is  binding
         precedent apply to the point with which we  are  concerned  and  ex
         parte Chan.


   30. Sir Thomas Bingham MR had this to say about the jeopardy in which an
       innocent entrant would be placed, were the  decision  to  have  been
       otherwise:


         I am horrified  at  the  suggestion  that  an  innocent  victim  of
         official error (or misbehaviour) should be thereby rendered  liable
         to arrest, detention and forcible removal. Fortunately, for reasons
         given by Hobhouse L.J., we  are  not  compelled  to  reach  such  a
         distasteful conclusion. In Ex parte Chan [1992]  1  W.L.R.  541  it
         appears to have been accepted that the  entry  permit  was  invalid
         (and the payment of �2,000 by the  entrant  may  have  strengthened
         that impression). But in the present case it cannot  be  said  that
         the work permits were invalid: they were what they appeared to  be;
         they contained no misstatement; and they were not forgeries.

The application of R v SSHD, ex parte Ku and others to this appeal

   31. Applying these principles to the facts of the  present  appeal,  the
       grant to the appellant of leave to remain to the  appellant  in  the
       letter of 21 December 2006 was  a  valid  grant  of  leave  and  the
       vignettes applied to the appellant's passport and those of the other
       appellants were valid grants.

Validity and invalidity; void and voidable; nullity

   32. The cases to  which  I  have  referred  speak  of  the  validity  or
       invalidity of the relevant documents. Without having  had  sight  of
       these cases, my directions spoke of whether the grant  was  void  or
       voidable which in one sense might be as useful a means of expressing
       the distinction.

   33. In the course of argument I raised with Mr Nath  the  example  of  a
       colour-printed photo static copy of a �5 note, inexpertly copied  by
       a forger.  Such a document is not currency at all.   In  particular,
       it is not legal currency.  The Bank of England would need to take no
       action to avoid it.  In contrast, if a more sophisticated  fraudster
       was able to operate the presses used to produce a �5 note and did so
       to produce a series of such notes, those produced would be to  those
       who innocently receive them no more and  no  less  than  a  �5  note
       irrespective of  the  absence  of  authority  on  the  part  of  the
       fraudster to produce them.  Whilst the Bank of England might wish to
       recall the banknotes so distributed, I would not consider them to be
       forgeries and, by that description, false.

   34. So, too, with a passport.  There is a significant difference between
       a passport produced or effaced by a forger and a  passport  produced
       by the authorities albeit, like Ms  Ali's  case,  without  complying
       with departmental procedures for the production of  a  passport.   I
       would readily classify the former as void from the outset and not  a
       passport at all.  I would regard, however, the latter as voidable in
       the sense that it is liable to be cancelled but until  that  occurs,
       it remains a valid passport.


   35. The reasons for this distinction appear obvious.  Sir Thomas Bingham
       MR (as he then was) spoke of his being horrified at  the  suggestion
       that an innocent victim of official error (or  misbehaviour)  should
       be rendered liable to arrest, detention and forcible  removal.   But
       the consequences may even go further.  As I suggested in argument on
       4 January 2013, if the holder of a passport properly  issued  cannot
       rely on the validity of his passport to secure entry to his  own  or
       another country, he and all passport-holders fail to achieve what is
       the very purpose of holding  a  passport.   If  it  is  open  to  an
       official or a third  party  to  require  the  holder  to  prove  its
       validity or refuse  entry,  there  is  little  point  in  holding  a
       passport.  If the holder of a validly produced  bank-note  (that  is
       one produced with  the  apparent  or  ostensible  authority  of  the
       issuer) is refused it as payment for a  debt,  no  holders  of  such
       notes could rely upon it as serviceable legal tender.   Whilst  this
       will be the consequence if a passport or a  bank  note  is,  in  the
       popular sense, a forgery, these draconian consequences  are  limited
       to those documents which  are  properly  classified  as  void  or  a
       nullity, that is, of no consequence at all.  To extend the class  to
       documents which are liable to  be  invalidated  by  reason  of  some
       impropriety  in  their  production  creates  a  situation  in  which
       passports, bank notes or other official documents are in circulation
       but, in the case of some (a  class  impossible  to  identify),  they
       carry a hidden defective gene (as it were) which renders them  void,
       irrespective of the good faith of the holder.  What  appears  to  be
       gold, looks like gold, tests like gold, smells like gold, turns  out
       to be pinchbeck.

General conclusions

   36. A document which is invalid or void  or  a  nullity  can  confer  no
       rights.


   37. A document provided by the Home  Office  which  has  the  effect  of
       granting an individual rights is valid if on its face it carries the
       authority of the Home Office (that is, it has its apparent,  implied
       or ostensible authority) notwithstanding the fact  that  its  actual
       production is flawed by a procedural irregularity or by fraud  which
       is the effective cause of its production.

   38.  Such  a  document  may  be  rendered  ineffective   by   subsequent
       cancellation but, until it is cancelled, it remains effective.

Conclusion on this appeal

   39. The respondent's decisions in these appeals were said to  have  been
       made pursuant to  paragraph  322(1)  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  a
       somewhat uncomfortable formulation of the Rule relying on  the  fact
       that variation of leave to remain was being sought for a purpose not
       covered by these Rules, even  when  applied  to  the  facts  as  the
       respondent  construed  them  to  be.   It  is  noteworthy  that  the
       Secretary of State did not allege that  the  appellant  himself  had
       made a false representation.  As I have found the original grant  of
       leave was not invalidated by the actions of  Ms  Ali  and  that  the
       appellant was innocent of wrong-doing, the application was not  made
       for a  purpose  not  covered  by  the  Rules  and  the  respondent's
       objection to the application falls away.   The  implication  of  the
       refusal was that, had the documents  been  valid,  leave  to  remain
       would have been permitted.   This  is  the  intended  effect  of  my
       determination.
