Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Malik (Legal Representative)
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow (Home Office Presenting
      Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. The appellant, born August 29, 1984  is  a  citizen  of  Vietnam.  She
    entered the United Kingdom as a student with leave until May 1,  2010.
    She was subsequently  granted  discretionary  leave  to  remain  until
    December 15, 2013 based  on  her  relationship  with  her  father.  On
    November 20, 2013 she  applied  for  further  discretionary  leave  to
    remain and the respondent refused this  application  on  December  31,
    2013  and  issued  a  removal  direction  under  section  47  of   the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under Section  82(1)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  on  January  13,
    2014 and on May 8, 2014  Judge  of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  Hunter
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") heard her appeal and dismissed
    it in determination promulgated on July 4, 2014.

 3. The appellant lodged grounds  of  appeal  on  July  22,  2014  and  on
    September 12, 2014  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Hollingworth
    granted permission to appeal finding it arguable the FtTJ had erred in
    his approach to article 8 in that the decisions of Gulshan (article 8-
    New rules)-Correct Approach)  [2013]  UKUT  00640  (IAC)  and  Shahzad
    (Article  8:  Legitimate  Aim)  [2014]  UKUT  00085  (IAC)  had   been
    superseded by the Court of Appeal in MM (Lebanon) v Secretary of State
    for the Home Department [2014] EWCA civ 985.  The respondent  filed  a
    Rule 24 response dated September 26, 2014 disputing the ground.

 4. The matter came before me on the above date  and  I  took  submissions
    from both Mr Malik and Mr Tarlow.

    SUBMISSIONS


 5. Mr Malik submitted the FtTJ had erred as follows:

     a. The decisions of Gulshan and Nagre were no  longer  legally  sound
        following  the  decision  of  MM.  Reference  should  be  made  to
        paragraphs [128] to [135] of MM for the correct approach. As  Lord
        Justice Aikens stated at paragraph [129]-


             "I  cannot  see  much  utility  in   imposing   this   further
             intermediary test. If the applicant cannot  satisfy  the  rule
             then there either is or there  is  not  a  further  article  8
             claim. This  will  have  to  be  determined  by  the  relevant
             decision maker."


     b. The FtTJ referred to the two-stage test  set  out  in  Gulshan  in
        paragraphs [58] to [59] of his determination and at paragraph [66]
        he did not consider article 8 ECHR.


     c. The FtTJ erred in this approach. If he erred then  he  argued  the
        matter should be remitted to the respondent to consider the matter
        afresh because  the  respondent  had  considered  the  application
        outside of  her  own  policy  that  applied  in  cases  where  the
        appellant had previously been given discretionary leave.

     d. He accepted this latter point could not amount to an error in law,
        as it had never been raised prior to this hearing.

 6. Mr Tarlow responded and submitted there  was  no  material  error.  He
    submitted the appellant either had an  exceptionality  argument  under
    article 8 that would lead to unjustifiably harsh consequences  or  she
    did not. The FtTJ found she did not and it was therefore open  to  him
    to proceed in the manner he did because the outcome was the  same  and
    any possible error was not material.

 7. I reserved my decision.

    MY FINDINGS ON ERROR IN LAW

 8. The FtTJ dealt with an application that the appellant knew  she  could
    not meet the Rules and in particular Appendix FM or  paragraph  276ADE
    HC  395.  The  FtTJ  set  out  in  paragraphs  [3]  to  [12]  of   his
    determination the issues under appeal and noted at paragraph [8]  that
    the appellant was separated from her husband and was  unaware  of  his
    whereabouts and why she felt it would be  unjust  to  require  her  to
    leave the United Kingdom. The FtTJ set out in paragraphs [9]  to  [11]
    the relevant content of her witness statement and he also recorded the
    content of her sister's witness statement. I am satisfied the FtTJ was
    fully au fait with the documentary evidence.

 9. Between paragraphs [13] and [49] the FtTJ set out in detail  the  oral
    evidence and submissions made at the conclusion of  the  evidence.  He
    then  made  findings  on  the  application  under  the  Rules  between
    paragraphs [50] and [57]  and  whilst  those  findings  relate  to  an
    application under the Rules his findings  are  also  relevant  to  any
    relevant issue under article 8 such as length of stay  here,  ties  to
    Vietnam and contact with her mother. The FtTJ rejected her claim  that
    she had no contact with her mother and concluded she still had ties to
    Vietnam because she lived there for eighteen years and had returned in
    both 2009 and 2012.

10. Mr Malik's submission is that from paragraph [58] of his determination
    the FtTJ erred. In  assessing  whether  the  approach  was  flawed  or
    whether there has been any material error  it  is  important  to  have
    regard to the whole determination.

11. I have set out above the evidence the FtTJ had regard to and  some  of
    the findings he made. In paragraph [59] the FtTJ had regard  to  those
    matters that were cited as good grounds for granting an  extension  of
    her stay but between paragraphs [60] and [65] he considered  each  and
    every point made on her behalf and made findings. These  findings  are
    significant because following MM an article 8  consideration  is  only
    necessary if there are exceptional and compelling  circumstances  that
    would make removal unjustifiably harsh.

12. In examining all of the evidence and the submissions in the manner  he
    did the FtTJ  concluded  there  were  no  exceptional  and  compelling
    circumstances that would make removal unjustifiably harsh. He did  not
    refer to MM because it had not been handed down at that time. Whist he
    applied the Gulshan test he did  not  identify  any  article  8  claim
    outside of the Rule and consequently, in line with MM, he found  there
    as no article 8 claim.

13. I am satisfied that the findings made were open to him and  there  was
    no material error in his approach.

14. Finally, Mr Malik did refer me to the respondent's policy.  I  pointed
    out to him at the  hearing  that  this  neither  formed  part  of  her
    original grounds of appeal lodged on January 9, 2014 nor any  argument
    at the hearing nor his grounds of appeal lodged on July 22,  2014.  At
    all times his firm represented her. I saw  no  reason  to  expand  the
    grounds of appeal especially in light of the firm findings made.

    DECISION


15. There is no material error of law. The original decision shall stand.

16. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
    (as amended) the appellant can be granted anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court  directs  otherwise.
    No order has been made and no request for an order  was  submitted  to
    me.
