                          SASITHARAN ANTHONY CRUZE
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This determination is given following directions which  I  gave  on  21
    August  2014,  in  which  I  invited  both  parties  to  make   further
    submissions in writing in light of the  decision  in  Raju  and  Others
    [2013] EWCA Civ 754 in which the decision of the Presidential  Tribunal
    in Khatel [2013] UKUT 44 was overturned.

 2. Subsequent  to  these  directions  further  representations  have  been
    received on behalf of both parties, and there is now agreement  between
    the parties that in light of the Court of Appeal decision in  Raju  the
    substantive appeal against the immigration decision must  be  dismissed
    but that the removal decision under Section 47 was unlawful.   I  agree
    and so find.



Decision

I set aside the determination of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Blackford  as
containing a material error of law and substitute the following decision:

The appellant's appeal against the substantive decision  refusing  to  grant
him further leave to remain is dismissed, under the  Immigration  Rules  and
on human rights grounds, Article 8.

The appellant's appeal is allowed to the extent that  the  removal  decision
under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006  was
not in accordance with the law.


Signed:                                 Date: 6 November 2014
