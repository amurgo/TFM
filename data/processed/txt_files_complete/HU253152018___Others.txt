Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Jaja, instructed by Everest Law Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Tufan, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. On 8 July 2020, I issued a decision in which I held that the First-tier
    Tribunal had erred materially in  law  in  dismissing  the  appellants'
    appeals against the respondent's  refusal  of  their  applications  for
    entry clearance.  I ordered that the decision of the FtT would  be  set
    aside in full and that the  appeal  would  be  retained  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal for rehearing de novo.  My earlier decision  is  appended  and
    should be read alongside this decision.

Background

 2. The appellants are siblings who were born on 25 July 1988,  7  November
    1989 and 8 May 1993 respectively.  They are currently  32,  31  and  27
    years old.  They are Nepalese nationals who seek to join  their  mother
    in the United Kingdom.  She is Dil Maya Limbu, a Nepalese national  who
    was born on 25 April 1967.  Her late husband  and  the  father  of  the
    appellants was Gyaneshor Limbu, a  retired  Gurkha  soldier.   Corporal
    Limbu served in the Brigade of Gurkhas for fifteen years, in  locations
    across the world.  The appellants were born in Hong Kong whilst he  was
    deployed there.  His Certificate of Service,  issued  on  13  September
    1993, recorded his excellent service throughout.


 3. Mr Limbu passed away on 1 January 2015.   On  17  September  2018,  the
    appellants and the sponsor  applied  to  come  to  the  United  Kingdom
    together.  They gave their permanent residential addresses as  Dhankuta
    in the east of the country.  They stated that they intended  to  settle
    in the United Kingdom as the spouse and children of  a  retired  Gurkha
    soldier.  The application forms completed by  each  of  the  appellants
    ended with a statement which provided some additional information about
    each of them.  This is what was said on the first applicant's form:


         I am son of late Gyaneshor Limbu, an ex-British Gurkha  who  served
         as a CPL.  I live with my mother  and  I  am  still  unmarried  and
         unemployed.  My mother is planning to go to the UK along  with  me,
         and my siblings on settlement visa.  I wish to go to the  UK  along
         with my mother and siblings for better future.   I  kindly  request
         you if you could grant me with required visa so that I can be  with
         my family rather than live  separately  and  have  a  better  life.
         Although  I  had  completed  degree  of  Doctor  of  Medicine  from
         Philippines, I am still not able to earn a living in Nepal.  I  had
         given examination for job at Public  Service  Commission  which  is
         very tough competition exam and  unfortunately  I  had  failed  the
         examination last year.  Even being a  doctor  by  profession  I  am
         still unemployed  in  Nepal.   I  am  financially  and  emotionally
         dependent on my mother.

 4. The sponsor was granted entry clearance.  The appellants'  applications
    were refused  on  6  December  2018.   The  ECO  considered  the  Adult
    Dependent Relative provisions in  the  Immigration  Rules  first.   She
    considered that the appellants were fit and well and  that  they  could
    not meet those requirements.  She considered Annex K to Chapter  15  of
    the Immigration Directorate Instructions.  She held that this  did  not
    apply to the appellants, since they were not in the process of  joining
    a retired Gurkha, and the Annex made no provision for those seeking  to
    join the spouse of a late Gurkha.   Consideration  was  then  given  to
    Article 8 ECHR.  The respondent cited domestic and ECtHR authority  and
    concluded that  the  appellants  had  failed  to  demonstrate  real  or
    committed or effective support from the sponsor.  She was not satisfied
    that Article 8 ECHR was engaged in its family life aspect.  Even if  it
    was, the  respondent  concluded  that  the  decision  to  refuse  entry
    clearance was  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  of  maintaining
    immigration control in each case.  On  review,  following  the  appeals
    being lodged, an Entry Clearance Manager was not persuaded  to  reverse
    the decisions.

Documentary Evidence


 5. In preparation for the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal,  bundles
    were filed  by  each  party.   The  respondent's  bundle  contains  the
    applications forms, notices of decision and documents  relating  to  Mr
    Limbu's service.  It also contains a note  from  the  Pension  Payments
    Office of the British Gurkhas in Nepal, which states that  the  sponsor
    was entitled to a pension of  �210.71  per  month  (30,243.92  Nepalese
    rupees) as the spouse of her late husband.

 6. There were two bundles filed by the appellants' solicitors.  The  first
    is properly indexed and paginated but it contains a number of documents
    which were irrelevant to the issues in the appeal.   There  were  eight
    documents which went to the identities  of  the  appellants  and  their
    relationship to their  mother  and  father,  although  that  biological
    relationship was never in issue.  Also in this bundle of  fifty  pages,
    however, were records of the appellants'  academic  achievements.   The
    first appellant graduated as a Doctor of Medicine  on  28  March  2015,
    from Emilio Aguinaldo College in the Philippines.  The second appellant
    had studied towards a medical qualification at Dhaka  National  Medical
    College in Bangladesh, starting in 2009.  The third appellant had  left
    school in the First Division, scoring an overall average of 70.13%.


 7. There  was  also  a  second  bundle,  which  was  neither  indexed  nor
    paginated.  This contained statements  made  by  the  appellants  on  5
    September  2019,  further  copes  of  identity  documents,  one   money
    remittance slip dated 31 May 2019, one payslip in  the  sponsor's  name
    showing net pay of �733 in the month of June  2019,  several  pages  of
    printed messages from a  mobile  telephone  (largely  in  Nepali);  the
    sponsor's Lloyd's bank account statement (2 August 2019 to 3  September
    2019); and the sponsor's Standard Chartered bank account  statement  (1
    January 2019 to 21 September 2019).

 8. No further documentary evidence was adduced before me.   Mr  Tufan  had
    not received the second bundle and I gave him a little time to consider
    that bundle, after which he confirmed that he was ready to proceed.


Oral Evidence


 9. I should record that there was an application, between my decision of 8
    July 2020 and  this  remaking  hearing,  for  the  appellants  to  give
    evidence from Nepal.  Since the remaking hearing was  initially  to  be
    remote, the appellants' solicitors sought permission for them  to  give
    evidence from Nepal via Skype.  I asked the appellants'  solicitors  to
    address the considerations set out in Nare [2011] UKUT  443  (IAC)  but
    they were unable to establish  that  the  Nepalese  government  had  no
    objection to live evidence being given from within its jurisdiction  to
    a Tribunal in the  UK:  [21](d)  of  Nare  refers.   It  was  in  those
    circumstances that I refused the application.  It was not renewed by Ms
    Jaja before me.  As a result, the only oral evidence I heard  was  from
    the sponsor.

10. The  sponsor  gave  evidence  through  a  Nepalese  interpreter.   They
    confirmed before she gave evidence that  they  were  able  to  converse
    freely and it was not suggested  at  any  point  that  there  were  any
    difficulties with interpretation.  I do not  propose  to  rehearse  the
    oral evidence which was given.  I shall refer to it insofar  as  it  is
    necessary to explain the findings I have reached.




Submissions


11. Mr Tufan submitted that the only  issue  to  be  resolved  was  whether
    Article 8(1) was engaged in its family life aspect.  In the event  that
    it was, it was clear from the authorities (Gurung [2013]  EWCA  Civ  8;
    [2013] 1 WLR 2546 and Ghising [2013] UKUT 567 (IAC)) that  there  could
    be only one outcome to the proportionality  assessment,  such  was  the
    weight to be attached to the 'historic wrong' against the  Gurkhas  and
    their family members.   It was agreed  between  the  parties  that  the
    correct test was as distilled by Lindblom LJ  (with  whom  Beatson  and
    Henderson LJJ agreed) at [36] of Jitendra  Rai  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  320:
    whether there is real or effective or committed support.  That was  the
    litmus test by which it was to  be  decided  whether  the  relationship
    between the appellants and  the  sponsor  disclosed  more  than  normal
    emotional ties.

12. Mr Tufan recalled that there had been a concern expressed by the First-
    tier Tribunal about the place in  which  the  appellants  were  living:
    their home village of Dhankuta  or  Kathmandu.   A  fresh  concern  had
    arisen in the oral evidence given by the sponsor.  She had stated  that
    she had moved to Kathmandu with the children for  the  purpose  of  the
    application (for entry clearance) but her witness  statement  suggested
    that she had moved there in 2008.  There were significant problems with
    the credibility of the evidence; it was inherently  unlikely  that  the
    first appellant would be unable to find work, as  a  qualified  doctor,
    for more than two years.  Equally, it was not credible that the  second
    appellant would have  been  unable  to  find  any  work  whatsoever  in
    Kathmandu.  It was more probable than not, in  Mr  Tufan's  submission,
    that the first and  second  appellants  were  working  and  were  self-
    sufficient.  Although  it  was  accepted  that  the  sponsor  made  her
    husband's pension available for  the  appellants'  use,  that  did  not
    amount to real, committed or effective  support  for  the  purposes  of
    Article 8 if, as  he  maintained,  the  appellants  were  in  work  and
    independent.


13. Mr Jaja noted that it was accepted by the respondent that  the  sponsor
    made her pension available for the appellants' use.  There was  nothing
    persuasive adduced by the respondent to cast doubt on what was said  by
    the appellants to be the truth of their circumstances.  It  was  agreed
    between the parties that the test to be applied was  that  in  Jitendra
    Rai.  In order to consider whether  there  was  real  or  committed  or
    effective support, the proper approach  was  to  consider  all  of  the
    evidence in the round.  It was noteworthy that  the  sponsor  had  been
    required to make four entry clearance applications at a  cost  of  more
    than $2000 each.  That money had been raised by the community. The case
    had been dismissed in the FtT and the sponsor had funded the cost of an
    onward appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  It  was  relevant  that  she  had
    borne that cost as it showed an element of dependency or support.   The
    sponsor received her pension into her Standard  Chartered  account  and
    she made all of that money available to the children. It was now in the
    region of 36,000 rupees per month.  The family home, in  Dhankuta,  was
    now occupied by the sponsor's brother-in-law and his  family.   It  was
    notable that the sponsor had always tried to live  with  her  children;
    wherever she was, the children were.


14. It had been submitted by Mr Tufan that there was a discrepancy  between
    what was said in the witness statement and  what  was  said  orally  as
    regards when the sponsor moved to Kathmandu.  She had agreed  that  she
    moved to Kathmandu 'for this process' but this was not to be taken  too
    literally.  Two properties had clearly been available to the family  at
    the material times.  If the appellants had not lived with the  sponsor,
    it was because they  were  studying  elsewhere,  whether  in  Nepal  or
    further afield.  The fact that the first appellant had studied  in  the
    Philippines was not to be held against him, as  he  remained  dependent
    upon his mother throughout: Pun [2011] UKUT 377 (IAC).   There was some
    evidence  of  additional  funds  being  sent  by  the  sponsor  to  the
    appellants but in any  event,  if  the  sponsor  was  genuinely  making
    available all of the funds she receives for her husband's pension,  the
    test in Rai would be met.  It was to be recalled that  there  was  also
    contact by Viber or Whatsapp.  The first appellant's efforts to  secure
    work in Nepal had been set out in detail and it was  apparent  that  he
    had only managed to secure a brief stint of  part  time  medical  work.
    There was no record that he had failed the Public  Service  examination
    but he had submitted all other evidence of academic achievements.  Even
    if the first appellant did have a job, what was sent by  way  of  funds
    sufficed to engage Article 8 ECHR.  It was relevant,  as  explained  in
    [17] of Rai to consider why the sponsor was in  the  UK;  she  had  not
    voluntarily separate from the appellants and relocated to the  UK;  she
    had availed herself of the  settlement  to  which  she  was  rightfully
    entitled, in the hope that they could join her  here.   In  considering
    that submission, it was also relevant that they  had  applied  together
    for entry clearance.  I was also invited to note  that  the  appellants
    were all around the age of thirty.


15. I reserved my decision at the end of submissions.


Analysis


16. As will be apparent from the above, there is  a  good  deal  of  common
    ground on the law and the facts.  It is agreed that I should apply  the
    test in Jitendra Rai to the question of whether Article 8(1) is engaged
    in  its  family  life  aspect.   It  is   not   necessary,   in   those
    circumstances, to direct myself at length in accordance with the  other
    authorities (from Advic v the United Kingdom (1995) 20 EHRR CD  125  to
    Pun v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 2106; [2018] 4 WLR) in which the  nature  of
    that assessment has been explored in depth.  Nor is it in dispute  that
    the engagement of Article 8(1) in  its  family  life  aspect  would  be
    determinative of the appeal.  That concession has  not  uniformly  been
    made before me in appeals of this nature but I regard it as  absolutely
    correct in light of Ghising (No 2) and [55]-[57] of Jitendra Rai.


17. As for the facts, it is not in dispute that  the  appellants  currently
    live together in Kathmandu and that the sponsor makes available to them
    the funds which enter her Standard Chartered bank account as  a  result
    of her husband's pension.  As Ms Jaja noted  in  her  submissions,  the
    more recent bank statements show that the pension has increased  beyond
    the level in the letter from the Brigade.  The bank statements (all  of
    which are from 2019) show that it had risen to more than 36,000  rupees
    per month, or around �225 per month.

18. It is not in dispute that the first appellant graduated  as  a  medical
    doctor after eight years studying in the Philippines, between 2007  and
    2015.   Mr Tufan did not suggest that this course of study was not paid
    for by the sponsor and her late husband.  Nor is it in dispute that the
    second appellant embarked upon medical studies in Bangladesh  and  that
    the third appellant embarked upon a degree in law.


19. The nature of the relationship between the appellants and  the  sponsor
    is otherwise very much in dispute, both as regards the current position
    and (recalling what was said in Rai) the position when the sponsor came
    to the UK in early 2019.   In her witness statement, the  sponsor  gave
    an account of how she and the children had moved around  in  the  years
    preceding the applications for entry clearance.  I need not set it  out
    in full, encompassing as it does the travels of the first appellant  to
    Manila and the second appellant to Bangladesh, as well as the time that
    the children spent in a hostel in Britnagar whilst they completed their
    schooling.  The critical point is that the family home has remained  in
    Dhankuta and the sponsor says in her statement that she lived  in  that
    family home until 2008 or 2009, at which point she moved  in  with  the
    second appellant in Kathmandu.

20. Mr Tufan submitted that the evidence given orally by  the  sponsor  was
    materially different.   He  based  that  submission  on  the  following
    questions and answers in cross-examination:


      Q. Just before you arrived in the UK, where were you all living?


      A. We were together as we were in the process of coming to the UK.


      Q. Were you together just for that process?


      A. We rented a house for this process.  They are now  in  that  rented
      house

21. Ms Jaja submitted that these answers should not be taken too  literally
    and that the words 'for this process' did not necessarily mean that the
    sponsor was suggesting that she had only moved  to  Kathmandu  for  the
    purpose of making the application for entry clearance.  Ms Jaja did not
    suggest what else the answer might  be  taken  to  mean  and  I  am  at
    something of a loss in that regard.  I clearly understood  the  sponsor
    to mean that she had only moved to Kathmandu  in  preparation  for  the
    entry  clearance  applications.   That   evidence   stands   in   stark
    contradiction of the suggestion in the sponsor's witness statement.

22. The sponsor was also unsure in  respect  of  basic  matters  about  the
    property which the appellants occupy  in  Kathmandu.   I  asked  a  few
    questions by way of clarification,  during  which  I  asked  about  the
    property and the rent which was paid for it.  I asked whether it was  a
    house or a flat.  The sponsor paused.  During the  pause,  a  gentleman
    who was sitting at the back of  the  court  spoke  to  the  sponsor  in
    Nepali, after which she gave her answer that the property was a 'normal
    house'. Ms Jaja told me that the man who had spoken was  the  sponsor's
    cousin, who had come to court to assist with translating the  sponsor's
    witness statement to her.  He had evidently decided to  provide  rather
    more assistance than that, however, and Ms Jaja  decided  that  it  was
    necessary to invite him to move further away from the sponsor to  avoid
    any further incidents of this nature.

23. In response to my question about the rent on the property in Kathmandu,
    the sponsor was equally unsure.  She said that she  was  not  sure  and
    that it might be in the region of 17,000 to 18,000 rupees.  In view  of
    the  claim  that  the  sponsor  is  said  to  be  entirely  financially
    responsible for the appellants, and that she herself lives on a  modest
    income from working at a fast food restaurant, I found it a  matter  of
    concern that she was unsure about this.  It tended  to  suggest  to  me
    that there was at least one other source of income and that the sponsor
    was not supporting all four adults as she claimed.

24. It is inherently unlikely, in any country, that a qualified doctor with
    an unblemished professional record  should  remain  unemployed  for  an
    extended period of time.  The first appellant  graduated  from  medical
    school in Manila in 2015 and returned to Nepal thereafter.  It is  said
    that he has been unable to find paid  employment  in  Nepal,  with  the
    exception of a brief  part-time  stint  in  Kathmandu  which  ended  in
    September 2018.  The particular reason that he is said to have found it
    difficult to secure employment in his chosen field is  that  he  failed
    the Public Service Commission  ("PSC")  examination.   I  explored  the
    evidence in support of that assertion with Ms Jaja.  At pp 39-41 of the
    appellant's main bundle, there is a copy of an  Admission  Card,  which
    was issued in preparation for a PSC examination on an unspecified date.
    It bears an 'advertisement number' and  'roll  number'.   There  is  no
    documentary evidence  beyond  that,  however.   There  is  no  document
    showing that he failed this examination, or by what margin.   There  is
    nothing to show what efforts, if any, he has made since  he  took  this
    examination to re-take it.  And there is no documentary evidence at all
    to show that he has sought employment or that he has not been  able  to
    secure any employment, whether because he has failed the  PSC  exam  or
    otherwise.  The trail simply goes cold at the point that  he  took  the
    PSC exam, and the evidence given orally and in the  witness  statements
    stands unsupported by evidence which should, on any proper  view,  have
    been readily available.  Ms Jaja  came  close,  at  one  point  in  her
    submissions, to suggesting that there would be no confirmation that  an
    individual had failed an examination of this nature.  Insofar as  there
    was any such suggestion, I reject it.  I  recognise,  of  course,  that
    Nepal is a poor country but I cannot accept that the first appellant is
    unable to provide documentary evidence of his assertions that he failed
    the PSC and that he has been  unable  to  find  work  as  a  doctor  in
    Kathmandu.  The sponsor said in her  own  evidence  that  the  children
    remained in Kathmandu because they were  more  likely  to  obtain  work
    there and that they spent all  their  time  searching  for  work.   The
    absence of evidence that those efforts have been unsuccessful  suggests
    the contrary, in my judgment.

25. The absence of evidence in this case extends beyond the concerns I have
    noted above.  In a case which is based not exclusively but to  a  large
    extent on what is said to be the complete financial dependence of three
    adults on their mother, I have very little evidence of the finances  of
    the family.  I have a single bank statement from the UK.  That  is  the
    Lloyd's Bank statement which covers the period between 2 August  and  3
    September 2019.  This statement raises more questions than it  answers.
    On two consecutive days in September 2019, the sponsor  received  �1000
    from a J Limbu.  On 3 September 2019, there was also a deposit of  �800
    made at the branch in South Harrow.  Mr Tufan  asked  about  the  �1000
    deposits.  The sponsor said that they had been borrowed from a Mr Limbu
    in order to help her with the legal fees  incurred  in  this  case  but
    there is nothing from Mr Limbu to support that assertion, nor is  there
    any evidence to explain where the deposit of �800  came  from.  In  the
    context of a woman who earns in the region of �400  to  �500  per  week
    before tax, and claims to  be  entirely  responsible  for  three  other
    adults, these are sizeable sums which called for a  properly  evidenced
    explanation.  The absence of a proper explanation  also  suggests  that
    there are additional sources of income available to this family.

26. The sponsor maintained in evidence before me that the first and  second
    appellants have been unable to secure any employment in Kathmandu other
    than the first appellant's brief period of part-time  employment.   She
    also maintained that the third appellant continues  to  study  law  and
    that she foots the bill for that programme of studies.  Oddly, however,
    there is no evidence to show that the third appellant is a law student,
    or that her mother pays for her  course.   In  the  event  that  either
    assertion was true, it would have  been  a  simple  matter  to  provide
    evidence in support of these claims.   Given  what  has  been  said  in
    cases such as Pun and Singh [2015] EWCA  Civ  630;  [2016]  Imm  AR  1,
    about the position of adult students whose studies are funded by  their
    families, evidence  in  support  of  this  assertion  would  have  been
    provided if it was available.

27. Drawing these threads together, I find that the position of this family
    is more likely than not as follows.  The first appellant is a qualified
    doctor who has been in employment in that field since he returned  from
    the Philippines in 2015.  He lives  with  his  siblings  in  Kathmandu.
    They are also likely to  be  in  employment.   They  live  as  a  self-
    sufficient family unit in the capital city, paying their own  rent  and
    bills.  It is accepted by the respondent - and I  accept  -  that  they
    have access to the sponsor's  Standard  Chartered  bank  account,  into
    which their late father's pension is paid, but they do not require  the
    money in that account.  The sponsor has sent very little  money  (�600)
    since she has been in the UK, although she earns around �2000 per month
    and her rent and bills amount to under �500 per month.  The sums  which
    she has sent (I note the IME remittance slip and the  IME  payments  in
    the bank statements) have not been required by the appellants  to  meet
    their needs and were sent purely to further the prospects of success of
    this appeal.  I do not accept, in the circumstances of this  particular
    case, that the funds which have been made available to  the  appellants
    amount to real or  committed  or  effective  support.   The  appellants
    would, I find, be perfectly able  to  support  themselves  without  any
    support from their mother in the United Kingdom.

28. I do not accept that the sponsor lived with the appellants  before  she
    came  to  the  United  Kingdom.   I  consider  that  they  had  already
    established independent lives in Kathmandu and that she merely went  to
    stay with them there whilst they applied for entry clearance to come to
    the United Kingdom.  There is very limited evidence of contact  between
    the appellants and the sponsor. There is a  record  of  some  telephone
    calls and messages  between  the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  in  the
    supplementary  bundle.   This  provides  very  little   assistance   in
    establishing whether the appellants have  more  than  normal  emotional
    ties with the sponsor, or vice  versa.   Considering  the  difficulties
    with the evidence which I have highlighted above,  I  do  not  consider
    there to be any such ties.  Nor do I consider that there were any  such
    ties immediately before the sponsor left Nepal.

29. The sponsor wants the best for her adult children.  Although I have  no
    doubt that they are in work in Kathmandu, they plainly want to join her
    in the UK and to benefit from the higher standard  of  living  in  this
    country.  I do not lose sight of the fact that she is  aging  and  that
    she would prefer to have her adult children around  her  as  she  grows
    older, and that she would benefit from the financial support of her son
    (in particular) in the future.  The family  has  expended  considerable
    sums on the applications and legal fees for those reasons.  But the law
    requires me to consider whether there was a family  life  in  existence
    when she left Nepal and whether there is a family life in existence  at
    today's date.  For all of the reasons I have given, I do not  find  the
    appellants to have discharged the burden of establishing that to be the
    case.  I find that Article 8(1) is  not  engaged  in  its  family  life
    aspect.

30. That conclusion is determinative of the appeal against the  appellants,
    for the reasons given by the Court of Appeal in Pun.  Even if there  is
    a private life in existence between the appellants and the sponsor,  it
    is only where family life continues to exist that great weight  can  be
    attached to the historic injustice  against  the  Brigade  of  Gurkhas.
    Having found that there is no family life, I do  not  accept  that  the
    decision  to  refuse   entry   clearance   is   anything   other   than
    proportionate.  The appellants fail to meet the Immigration  Rules  and
    the policy in  Annex  K  and  they  are,  on  my  findings,  living  an
    independent life in Kathmandu.  There is nothing disproportionate about
    the refusal of entry in these particular circumstances.

                          DECISION AND REASONS (P)

 1. The appellants are siblings who were born on 25 July 1988,  7  November
    1989 and 8 May 1993.  They are nationals of Nepal who appealed  against
    decisions  made  by  the  respondent  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (ECO),
    refusing their applications for entry clearance as the adult dependents
    of their mother.  The sponsor is Dil Maya Limbu.  Her husband, and  the
    late father of the appellants, was Gyaneshor Limbu,  a  retired  Gurkha
    solider.

Background

 2. The appellants' applications for entry clearance were  refused  by  the
    ECO on 8 December 2018.   Those  decisions  were  upheld  by  an  Entry
    Clearance Manager on 22 March 2019.  So it was that  the  appeals  came
    before a judge of the First-tier Tribunal, sitting at Hatton  Cross  on
    25 September 2019.  In her subsequent decision, issued on 30  September
    2019, the judge dismissed  the  appeals  on  Article  8  ECHR  grounds,
    finding that the appellants did not enjoy family life with their mother
    for the purposes of Article 8 ECHR.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 3. The appellants were granted permission to appeal  against  the  judge's
    decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge Shimmin, who considered it to  be
    arguable that the judge had misdirected herself in  law  regarding  the
    test for the engagement of Article 8 ECHR in such  circumstances;  that
    she had misunderstood the law which applied to periods  of  time  spent
    living outside the family home; and that she had  made  findings  which
    were not in accordance with the evidence.

 4. This appeal was due to be heard at Field House on 26 March 2020.  On 20
    March 2020, however, Field House closed its doors to the public  amidst
    the global Covid-19 pandemic and the appeal hearing was  adjourned.   I
    reviewed the file on 26 March 2020 and directed the parties to consider
    whether the appeal could properly be determined on the papers  and,  if
    so, to make submissions upon it.  Due to the pressure  on  the  reduced
    staff at Field House, my directions were only sent to the parties on  7
    May 2020.

 5. If submissions were made by the appellants' representatives in response
    to my directions, those submissions are not before me.  What is  before
    me, though, is a short response from Ian Jarvis,  a  Senior  Presenting
    Officer, on behalf of the  ECO,  and  an  email  from  the  appellant's
    solicitors (Messrs Everest).  Those  two  documents  show  that  it  is
    agreed between the parties that there need  be  no  hearing  to  decide
    whether the First-tier Tribunal erred in law.  That  accords  with  the
    view I had provisionally taken.  In light of the agreement between  the
    parties, I am content to  proceed  to  resolve  that  question  on  the
    papers, as permitted by  rule  34  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008.

 6. It is also accepted by Mr Jarvis that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred
    materially in law, for the following reasons.

 7. At [11]-[14] of her decision, the judge expressed a number of  concerns
    about the credibility of the account presented to her by the appellants
    and the sponsor.  She was concerned that  the  sponsor  had  given  her
    permanent residential address as the village  of  Dhankuta,  which  she
    considered to contradict the evidence of the sponsor that she had  been
    living in Kathmandu before she came to the  UK.   The  judge  found  it
    difficult to accept that the first and second appellants were unable to
    find work and that the family were finding it difficult  to  make  ends
    meet.  Doubt was cast on these assertions by the medical qualifications
    of the first and second appellants and the  partially  completed  legal
    studies of the third appellant.  She did not accept that the appellants
    were receiving funds from their mother, whether via Hundi  transfer  or
    via her bank account.  She was  not  satisfied  that  the  sponsor  was
    providing real, committed and effective  support  for  the  appellants.
    She doubted whether the appellants and the  sponsor  were  even  living
    together before the latter came to the  UK,  and  she  noted  that  the
    sponsor had chosen to leave her adult children in  Nepal  and  had  not
    seen them since she did so.

 8. It is accepted by Mr Jarvis that the  judge  failed  to  take  material
    evidence  into  account  in  reaching  the  findings  of  fact  I  have
    summarised above (that being the complaint advanced in the  appellants'
    third ground of appeal).  The evidence in question is the  explanation,
    given in the sponsor's witness statement, of why she gave her permanent
    residential address as the village of Dhankuta.   There,  she  explains
    that she considers herself and her children to 'belong' to the village,
    which is her husband's ancestral  home.   She  also  states  that  they
    continue to own the family property in the village, whereas the address
    at which they lived in Kathmandu is a rented property.   Mr  Jarvis  is
    correct, in my judgment, to concede that the judge cannot  properly  be
    said to have taken this  evidence  into  account,  since  there  is  no
    reference to it in her decision.  It might have been that the  evidence
    would have made no difference to the judge's  conclusion  but  she  was
    necessarily required to  take  it  into  account  before  reaching  the
    conclusions that she did.

 9. Nor, it seems, did the judge take into account evidence which  appeared
    to show a remittance of funds from the sponsor's Lloyd's  bank  account
    to the appellants on 13 August 2019 before concluding  as  she  did  in
    relation to financial support.  These errors suffice to  undermine  the
    judge's conclusions as a whole.  It  is  apparent  that  she  was  very
    concerned  about  the  sponsor's  address  and  that  she  was  equally
    concerned about  the  absence  of  documentary  evidence  of  financial
    support.  Having failed to take relevant evidence into account in  both
    respects, I am satisfied that the judge erred  materially  in  law  and
    that her decision must be set aside.


10. Mr Jarvis also accepts that the judge 'misdirected herself  in  respect
    of the test in Rai', which is a reference to the decision of the  Court
    of Appeal in Rai v ECO [2017] EWCA Civ  320.   This  is  the  complaint
    made, at length, over the course of the appellants'  first  and  second
    grounds of appeal.  I am  bound  to  observe  that  I  am  rather  more
    circumspect about accepting that this experienced judge erred  in  this
    respect.  At [10], she directed herself not only to  Rai  but  also  to
    Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31 and to Lang J's analysis in  Ghising
    v ECO [2012] UKUT 160 (IAC).  She  was  plainly  well  aware  that  the
    material question before her was whether there was  a  family  life  in
    existence between the adult appellants and their mother and  she  noted
    that the dominant question in that  analysis  was  whether  there  were
    'more than the usual emotional ties'.  There is reference to that  test
    at the start and end of the judge's analysis, at [10] and [16]  of  her
    analysis.

11.  What  is  said  by  the  appellants,  however,  is  that   the   judge
    misunderstood or misapplied what was said by Lindblom LJ  in  Rai.   At
    [17] of his judgement, Lindblom LJ  recalled  what  had  been  said  by
    Sedley LJ at [17] of Kugathas, that that "if dependency is read down as
    meaning "support", in the personal sense, and if one adds, echoing  the
    Strasbourg jurisprudence, "real" or "committed" or "effective"  to  the
    word "support", then it represents ... the irreducible minimum of  what
    family life implies".  That formulation appears at [28] and at [36]  of
    Lindblom LJ's judgment, in which there is repeated reference to real or
    committed or effective support.  It was accepted by the Court of Appeal
    in that case that the judge in the FtT had elevated the  test  for  the
    engagement of Article 8 ECHR beyond that threshold.  The same complaint
    is made in this case.  The author of the grounds of appeal  notes  that
    the judge in the FtT made reference at [10] to the test  being  whether
    there was 'committed and real dependency' and, at [14],  she  concluded
    that the sponsor was  not  'providing  real,  committed  and  effective
    support' to the appellants.


12. Had it not been for the respondent's  concession,  I  might  well  have
    found that the judge's mode of expression at [10] and [14]  was  merely
    infelicitous, given that she plainly had the  relevant  authorities  at
    the forefront of her mind.  Since the point has been conceded, however,
    I am prepared to accept that the judge misunderstood the test, which is
    expressed throughout Kugathas and Rai as being 'real  or  committed  or
    effective support'.

13. In the circumstances, I accept that the judge materially erred  in  law
    in overlooking relevant evidence and in misdirecting herself in law  as
    to the test for the engagement of Article 8 ECHR  in  its  family  life
    aspect.  The decision on the appeal will be set aside and will have  to
    be remade de novo.

Relief

14. The appellant and the respondent have also agreed in writing  that  the
    appeal should be remitted to be re-heard by the FtT.  I do not consider
    that to be the appropriate course.  The appeals are already  18  months
    old.  The Immigration and Asylum Chamber is coming to  grips  with  new
    ways of working as a result of  social  distancing  measures.   I  have
    reason to believe that the appeals can be re-heard  more  expeditiously
    in the Upper Tribunal and I will direct that they be retained  so  that
    the decision on the appeal can be remade by UTIAC, under  s12(2)(b)(ii)
    of the TCEA 2007.

15. There will be a case management hearing before me  in  advance  of  the
    substantive  hearing.   That  hearing  will  be  by  way  of  telephone
    conferencing.  I will expect the parties to consider, and  if  possible
    to agree, how the next hearing should be  conducted.   I  do  not  know
    whether the sponsor or the advocates are able to attend Field House for
    a fully attended or a hybrid hearing, or whether a hearing conducted by
    video conferencing would be preferable.  I will give  consideration  to
    these questions with the  assistance  of  the  advocates  at  the  case
    management hearing.   They  would  be  well  advised  to  consider  the
    President of the Family Division's publication entitled The Road  Ahead
    in advance of that hearing, and to  consider  carefully  the  means  by
    which these appeals might be resolved fairly and justly whilst ensuring
    that the wellbeing of all participants  is  safeguarded  appropriately.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT is set aside and the decision on the appeal will  be
remade, de novo, in the Upper Tribunal.
