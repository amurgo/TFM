Representation:

For the Appellant:  Mr Selway, Halliday Reeves sols
For the Respondent: Mrs Pettersen, HOPO


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


   1. This is the Appellants  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Kelly made following a hearing at  Bradford  on  the  9
      January 2013, dismissing his appeal against the Respondent's  decision
      to refuse to grant him asylum.


   2. The original grounds challenge the judge's decision on asylum  grounds
      but Mr Selway told me that he was not pursuing  them.  The  judge  had
      made entirely sustainable findings on  the  facts  and  the  Appellant
      would not be at risk on return.

   3. Both parties agreed however that the judge had  erred  in  failing  to
      make any findings at all on the  Article  8  claim,  although  it  was
      specifically argued before him.

   4. It was my initial view that the defect could be cured and the decision
      remade by the Upper Tribunal today. However Mr Selway  said  that  the
      entire basis of the Appellant's claim had changed  since  the  hearing
      before Judge Kelly. The Appellant was now in a stable relationship and
      had become a father.

   5. Since none of the evidence has ever  been  considered  before  it  was
      agreed that the proper course was for this appeal to be remitted  back
      to Judge Kelly to complete his determination and make a decision  with
      respect to Article 8, on the basis of the fresh  evidence  to  be  put
      before the Tribunal.

   6. The judge erred in law in failing to determine one of the issues which
      was before him. To the extent that that issue remains outstanding, the
      decision is set aside.

   7. This appeal will be heard at Bradford when the decision will be remade
      by Judge Kelly.


Signed                                  Date 12th September 2013
