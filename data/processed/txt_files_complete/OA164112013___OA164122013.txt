DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Hodgkinson promulgated on 29 August 2014  which  dismissed
   the Appellant's appeal on all grounds.
Background


3. The Appellant are a mother and son born on 24 December 1980  and  24  May
   2012 respectively and are citizens of Sri Lanka.
4.  On  26  June  2013  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the   Appellants
   application  for  entry  clearance  as  the  spouse  and  child   of   Mr
   Thilaimpalam Uruthirasikami, the child's  application  being  refused  in
   line with that of his mother and therefore I will refer to 'the Appellant
   'in the remainder of this decision meaning  the  first  Appellant  .  The
   refusal letter gave a number of reasons:
   a) The Appellant did not meet the suitability requirements of Appendix FM
      as she failed to provide satisfactory evidence of her identity.
   b) The failure to satisfactorily establish her identity  also  meant  the
      application  fell  to  be  refused  under  paragraph  320(3)  of   the
      Immigration Rules.
   c) The exclusion of the  Appellant  was  conducive  to  the  public  good
      because the Appellant had been convicted of an offence  and  sentenced
      to a period of  8  months  imprisonment  in  2011  and  therefore  the
      application fell to be refused under paragraph EC-P1.1(c).
   d) The relationship between the Appellant and her partner was not genuine
      or subsisting.
   e) The application did not meet the financial requirements of  the  Rules
      as the Appellant had not established by mandatorily required  evidence
      that her sponsor earned a gross income of ï¿½22,400.
   f) The application was considered by reference to Article 8 and there was
      no reason why the sponsor could not relocate to Sri Lanka to  continue
      family life with his wife and child there.





The Judge's Decision
5. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge  Hodgkinson  ("the  Judge")  dismissed  the  appeal   against   the
   Respondent's decision. The Judge found:
   a) That the relationship  between  the  Appellant  and  the  sponsor  was
      genuine and subsisting.
   b) The Appellant had satisfactorily  established  her  identity  and  the
      Respondent bore the burden of showing that her passport was false  and
      had not done so.
   c) The Appellant was convicted of an offence in 2011 and sentenced  to  8
      months imprisonment and her exclusion was conducive to the public good
      although he identified that there  was  a  'flexible  element  to  the
      application of S-EC.1.4' and he set out  that  provision  noting  that
      this required him to look at  Article  8  as  he  found  that  it  was
      'inextricably linked to the requirements of the above Rules.'
   d) He found that he was obliged to look at Article 8  outside  the  rules
      and consider the  question  of  whether  'there  are  any  exceptional
      circumstances or applicable compelling factors.'
   e) He found at paragraph 34  that  the  Appellants  could  not  meet  the
      financial requirements of the Rules and could only ever succeed  under
      Article 8.
   f) He then considered Article 8  by  reference  to  Razgar   taking  into
      account the best interests of the second Appellant who is a child  and
      found as a fact that family life could be pursued  in  Sri  Lanka  and
      therefore Article 8 was not engaged.  However  he  then  went  on  the
      consider, if he were wrong about that, the remaining  questions  posed
      in Razgar . He found that there  were  no  exceptional  or  compelling
      circumstances and the decision was proportionate.
6. Grounds of appeal were lodged on the basis that the Judge  had  erred  in
   his approach to the discretion afforded him under paragraph  S-EC.1.4  of
   Appendix FM; in the alternative he had erred by imposing an  intermediate
   hurdle of identifying 'arguable grounds' for departing  from  the  rules;
   erred in his conclusion that  Article  8;  erred  in  his  assessment  of
   proportionality.
7. On 30 October 2014 First-tier  Tribunal Judge Simpson gave permission  to
   appeal stating that the grounds disclosed an arguable error of law

8. At the hearing I heard submissions  from  Ms  Walker  on  behalf  of  the
   Appellant that :

   a) She relied on her grounds of appeal.

   b) The approach to the exercise of the  discretion  in  relation  to  the
      suitability requirements was flawed in that the Judge had  erroneously
      found that the maintenance of a fair system of immigration control was
      a countervailing factor  when  the  suitability  requirements  had  an
      express provision for that particular provision to be  waived  if  the
      exception as set out applied.

   c) What should have been undertaken was an assessment of the strength  of
      family life against the nature of the criminality.

   d) The Judge applied the wrong test  as  to  whether  family  life  could
      continue in Sri Lanka.

9. On behalf of the Respondent  Mr Avery submitted that :

   a) He struggled to see and difference between the approach of  the  Judge
      and what was being argued by Ms Walker. The determination  had  to  be
      looked at in the round and it was clear that the judge had  considered
      all of the  factors  relevant  to  Article  8  and  his  decision  was
      sustainable.

Finding on Material Error

10. Having heard  those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
   Tribunal made no material errors of law.

11. The first challenge raised in the grounds of appeal are that  the  Judge
   materially erred in his approach to the discretion that was  afforded  to
   him under the suitability  requirements  as  set  out  under  S-EC1.4  of
   Appendix FM having found that the Appellant  had  been  convicted  of  an
   offence and  sentenced  to  a  period  of  imprisonment  that  meant  her
   exclusion was conducive to the public good.

12. The discretion which was recognised and set out by the  Judge  reads  as
   follows:

   "Where this paragraph applies, unless refusal would be  contrary  to  the
   Human Rights Convention or the Convention and protocol  Relating  to  the
   Status of refugees, it will only be in exceptional circumstances that the
   public interest in maintaining refusal will be outweighed  by  compelling
   factors."

13. The Judge concluded correctly in my view that what was required  was  an
   assessment of the Appellant's claim under Article 8  (paragraph  32)  and
   that is what he did applying the guidance and structured approach set out
   in Razgar  .  It  is  alleged  that  the  Judged  erred  by  imposing  an
   intermediate hurdle of identifying arguable grounds  for  departing  from
   the Rules but I reject that submission as the  Judge  manifestly  carried
   out a full separate assessment of the claim under Article  8  outside  of
   Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE by  reference  to  Razgar  in  order  to
   assess whether the Appellants should be granted leave outside the  Rules.
   Again I note that there has been no argument advanced that the  Rules  do
   not adequately deal with the  Appellants  circumstances  and  that  those
   factors would justify a grant of leave outside the rules

14. Paragraph 8 of the Grounds argue that the Judge then  found  that  there
   were no arguable good grounds for granting leave to  remain  outside  the
   rules applying the reasons set out in Gulshan and as such concluded  that
   it was not appropriate to exercise  the  discretion  under  paragraph  S-
   EC1.4. I am satisfied however that decision must be read as a  whole  and
   this ground misstates what the Judge has done. I am  satisfied  that  the
   Judge started at paragraph 36 by summarising his conclusion at  paragraph
   51 that the case reflected no  exceptional  circumstances  or  compelling
   factors which would be  required  both  by  S-EC1.4  of  Appendix  FM  to
   exercise a discretion  and under Article 8 to  grant  leave  outside  the
   Rules and set out at paragraph 36-51 all of the facts of the case that he
   considered in reaching that conclusion.

15.  Having  reached  the  conclusion  that  there   were   no   exceptional
   circumstances he was entitled to conclude that there was no  reason  that
   the public interest should be outweighed by  compelling  factors  because
   again he found no such factors to exist.  The existence of  such  factors
   was required for him to  exercise  the  discretion  in  relation  to  the
   suitability requirements and in relation to granting  leave  outside  the
   Rules under Article 8. I note moreover that there are no facts that it is
   suggested  the  Judge  overlooked  that  might  amount   to   exceptional
   circumstances or indeed compelling factors and I am  satisfied  that  the
   Judge has reached conclusions that were open to him  and  the  matter  of
   what weight he gives them is  a  matter  for  him  unless  perversity  is
   alleged which it is not.

16.  Ground 2 argues that the  Judge  was  not  entitled  to  conclude  that
   Article 8 was not engaged. I remind myself that the  House  of  Lords  in
   Razgar stated that the ultimate question  is,  "whether  the  refusal  of
   leave to enter or remain in circumstances where the life  of  the  family
   cannot reasonably be  expected  to  be  enjoyed  elsewhere,  taking  full
   account  of  all  considerations  weighing  in  favour  of  the  refusal,
   prejudices the family life of the  applicant  in  a  manner  sufficiently
   serious to amount to a breach  of  the  fundamental  right  protected  by
   Article 8. If the answer to this question is affirmative, the refusal  is
   unlawful and the authority must so decide."

17. The Judge in this appeal therefore considered whether  the  family  life
   of the Appellants and the sponsor could  reasonably  be  enjoyed  in  Sri
   Lanka. He found at paragraphs 39-43 that the sponsor was  of  Sri  Lankan
   origin and was not granted refugee status and therefore on the face of it
   there was no reason he could not return  to  Sri  Lanka.  He  had  indeed
   returned to his home country for a month in 2012  and  a  month  in  2013
   without alleging any problems . He took into account that the sponsor had
   lived in the United Kingdom since 1999 and worked and was settled in  the
   United Kingdom but concluded that they could enjoy family  life  together
   in Sri Lanka. I am satisfied this was a conclusion open  to  him  on  the
   facts and therefore he was entitled to conclude that Article  8  was  not
   engaged.  The grounds do not identify any factor overlooked by the  Judge
   and merely constitute a disagreement  with  the  conclusion  he  reached.
   However even if he was wrong in this approach he nevertheless went on  to
   ask the remaining Razgar questions  on  the  basis  that  Article  8  was
   engaged so any suggestion that his approach  to  whether  Article  8  was
   engaged at this stage was not material given that he went on to  ask  the
   remaining questions .

18. In relation to the assessment of proportionality  I  am  satisfied  that
   the Judge properly weighed all of the competing factors into account  and
   came to a conclusion as to proportionality that was open to  him  on  the
   facts. Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of  proportionality  is
   arguable as being completely wrong, there is no error of law.

19. I am therefore satisfied that the Judge's determination when read  as  a
   whole set out findings that were sustainable  and  sufficiently  detailed
   and based on cogent and careful reasoning.



CONCLUSION

20. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established  and  that
   the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

21. The appeal is dismissed.
