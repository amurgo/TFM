Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Unigwe, instructed by Primarc Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a national of the  Philippines.   She  appealed  to  a
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal against the respondent's decision of 4
    March 2015 to refuse to vary leave to remain in the United Kingdom  and
    to remove her by way of  directions  under  s.47  of  the  Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

2.   She had applied for further leave to remain as  the  unmarried  partner
    of a British citizen who  was  permanently  settled  in  and  had  been
    residing in the United Kingdom.  Her evidence in her witness  statement
    was that she had met her partner, [MW],  in  April  2012  in  Weymouth,
    Dorset, and they began living together at his house in Poole after  six
    months.  She said that she had come to the United Kingdom as a  student
    and regularly attended college in London.  Because of  regular  classes
    she was compelled to move to  her  sister's  house  and  resided  there
    during her college days.  She said that whenever she got free time  she
    would travel back to Mr [W]'s house in Poole and stay  with  him.   She
    said that they had developed their relationship since April 20112  with
    the intention of marrying each other.  Her evidence  was  that  he  had
    been divorced since 2014.  They intended to marry once she  obtained  a
    divorce from her  marriage.  She  had  already  processed  her  divorce
    petition at Reading County Court.  She said that she could not  produce
    any further cohabitation documents because she had been living with her
    sister and pursuing full time education.  She said that she had  had  a
    joint bank account with Mr [W] since August 2014.  He had been divorced
    since 2014.

3.   In his statement Mr [W] confirmed the date on which they  met  and  the
    period after which they started living together and the fact  that  the
    appellant had come as a student and was regularly attending college  in
    London and had to move to her sister's house because of regular classes
    and stayed there during college days and that  whenever  she  got  free
    time she would travel back to his home in Poole and stay with him.   In
    cross-examination  he  said  that  she  lived  with  him  now  and  had
    previously lived with her sister.  He thought it was  longer  than  she
    had said and said he had actually got divorced in December 2013.

4.   The judge noted the wording of the relevant provisions of  Appendix  FM
    of paragraph 276ADE.  The appellant was required to show that  she  was
    either the spouse, civil partner, fiancï¿½e or person who had been living
    together with the appellant in a relationship akin to marriage or civil
    partnership  for  at  least  two  years  prior  to  the  date  of   the
    application.  He said that  he  was  satisfied  on  the  basis  of  the
    evidence that they had not been living together for at least two  years
    prior to the date of the application.  They had given some  conflicting
    evidence as to exactly how long they had  been  in  a  relationship  or
    living together and he said he was absolutely  certain  that  the  most
    their argument could be that they  had  only  recently  started  living
    together because hitherto she had been living with her sister while she
    was at college and that was not living together in a relationship  akin
    to marriage.

5.   The appellant sought and was granted permission to appeal  against  the
    decision refusing leave and dismissing the appeal under  Article  8  on
    the basis that it was arguable that the  judge  had  erred  in  law  in
    concluding that a  spouse  who  lived  part  of  the  week  at  another
    residence for educational purposes could  not  be  said  to  be  living
    together in a relationship akin to marriage for  the  purposes  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

6.   Mr Unigwe drew my attention to a decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Fetle [2014] UKUT 00267 (IAC).  There the Tribunal was considering  the
    wording of paragraph 352AA of HC 395 that: "Parties  have  been  living
    together in a relationship  akin  to  either  a  marriage  or  a  civil
    partnership which has subsisted for two years or more".   It  was  held
    that that  did  not  require  two  years  cohabitation  but  two  years
    subsistence of the relationship.

7.   Mr Bramble made the point that the relevant provision  of  Appendix  FM
    at paragraph GEN1.2 was

         "... a person who has been living together with the applicant in  a
         relationship akin to a marriage or a civil partnership for at least
         two years prior to the date of application."

8.   He argued that the issue of subsistence did not form part of  paragraph
    GEN1.2.  At paragraph 9 the Tribunal made the point that there may be a
    number of reasons why a couple, whether married or unmarried, do not in
    fact live together: the demands of employment may be such a reason,  or
    they may need to flee the country.  Such factors it was  said  did  not
    necessarily destroy a relationship  which  might  continue  to  subsist
    despite the separation.

9.   The wording of the statements of the appellant and the sponsor set  out
    at  paragraphs  4  and  6  of  the  judge's  decision  are  essentially
    identical.  However he identified discrepancies with regard to the year
    in which the sponsor Mr [W] was divorced, a matter which I think to  be
    essentially irrelevant, and the fact  that  with  regard  to  Mr  [W]'s
    confirmation that the appellant lived with him now and  had  previously
    lived with her sister he thought it was longer than she had said.  This
    could be said to be an inconsistency with his statement that after  six
    months they had both started to live together at his address in Poole.

10.  The difficulty with the evidence, from the appellant's point  of  view,
    is that it is unclear what period she spent in London and  what  period
    she spent in Poole.  In her witness statement she said she  resided  at
    her sister's house during her college days and whenever  she  got  free
    time she used to travel back to her partner's house at Poole  and  stay
    with him.  Mr [W] said the same thing in his statement, and  those  are
    the statements set out in the judge's decision.  In addition, there was
    a letter from Greys Estate  and  Letting  Agents  confirming  that  the
    appellant had been known as  a  non-permanent  resident  at  the  Poole
    address and had been named on the tenancy agreement for the  last  four
    months, confirming her residency status  as  Mr  [W]'s  partner.   That
    letter is dated 9 March 2015.  There are City and  Guilds  certificates
    in respect of the appellant, but they are dated July  2012  and  August
    2012, which both predate the date when it was said the  couple  started
    to live together.  There is a letter from Impact International  College
    concerning the appellant's studies there for two years, but this  again
    is dated August 2012.  There are earlier certificates also  from  2010.
    There was a brief letter from M Radford who verifies that he had  known
    the appellant and the sponsor were living  as  his  neighbours  at  the
    Dorset address since 2013.   The  letter  is  dated  19  October  2013.
    There is also a letter from Mrs May Cotton attesting to  the  appellant
    attending her salon for hair and  beauty  appointments  since  February
    2013. D J Cliff also attested to having known the couple as  living  as
    his neighbours at the Poole address since 2013.  There is also  a  copy
    of a bank statement in their joint names in 2015.   There  was  also  a
    document from Laurence Bassa, the appellant's brother,  who  said  that
    she had been living with him and his family in Reading since  2008  and
    that she had met the sponsor in April 2012 and decided to live together
    at Mr [W]'s house since November 2012.   He  said  that  she  had  been
    commuting and staying at his house in  Reading,  Berkshire  during  her
    scheduled days for college but during her free days she travelled  back
    to Poole and stayed at Mr [W]'s residence.  There is also an email from
    the sponsor dated 21 January 2015 referring to the  fact  that  as  the
    appellant had to travel for  her  student  requirements  she  had  been
    staying at her brother's home in Reading while attending college  days.
    They had not added her to his address as she had no right to  work  and
    could not contribute towards his household bills.

11.  I must bring these matters together.  I consider  that  the  judge  was
    justified in the conclusion that he reached.  There is  a  conflict  in
    the evidence as the duration of the couples living together, bearing in
    mind what Mr [W] said in cross-examination as recorded at  paragraph  7
    of the decision.  The essential difficulty is a lack of clear  evidence
    as to the circumstances of the couple living apart, in the  sense  that
    there seems to be a conflict in the evidence  as  to  whether  she  was
    staying in Reading or London, whether she was living with  her  brother
    or sister, and how regularly it was that  she  travelled  to  Poole  to
    spend time with Mr [W].  The relationship is clearly a genuine one,  as
    is attested to by the fact that the couple married yesterday.  But  the
    matter I have to decide is whether there is any error  of  law  in  the
    judge's decision.  He was entitled to take into account the discrepancy
    as to how long the couple have lived together, and the vagueness in the
    evidence concerning where and when  she  spent  time  living  with  her
    sister or brother during the time  of  her  studies,  was  such  as  to
    justify his conclusion that they had not shown  they  had  been  living
    together in a relationship akin to marriage.  I agree with  Mr  Bramble
    that only limited assistance can be  derived  from  Fetle  because  the
    concept of subsistence of marriage which was  important  in  that  case
    does not form part of the relevant rule in this case.  It may  well  be
    that on a fresh application the  uncertainties  and  vagueness  in  the
    evidence can be clarified.  Certainly the fact that  the  couple  spent
    some time apart during the week is in no sense fatal to  their  ability
    to show that they have been living together in a relationship  akin  to
    marriage or civil partnership.   In the end it is a matter  of  degree,
    and the lack of clarity in the evidence was such that it  was  open  to
    the judge to find that the requirements of the Rules had not been  met.
    Accordingly his decision dismissing this appeal is maintained.

No anonymity direction is made.
