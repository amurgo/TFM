               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Chaudry, of Latta & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent refused the appellant's  protection  claim  for  reasons
    explained in her letter dated 22 June 2016.

 2. FtT Judge David C Clapham SSC  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  for
    reasons explained in his decision promulgated on 18 March 2017.

 3. The principal issue raised in the appellant's grounds is based  on  �55
    of the decision:

         "According to the original Home Office bundle, when  the  appellant
         was encountered by  the  immigration  officers  in  Inverness,  the
         appellant was hiding in  the  basement.  �29  of  the  reasons  for
         refusal  letter  is  correct  to  suggest   that   such   behaviour
         demonstrates an attempt to evade the enforcement officers."

 4. The appellant's statement dated 8 December 2016 was before the FtT.  He
    says at �20 that he did not hide, and there was no  basement  (or  back
    door) where he was detained.

 5. Mr Chaudry did not press anything else in the grounds.  Apart from this
    point, they do not rise above  disagreement  with  adverse  credibility
    findings.

 6. Mr Matthews accepted that the judge failed to deal with the appellant's
    evidence in response to �29 of the  reasons  for  refusal  letter.   He
    submitted that the judge gave several stronger  reasons  for  rejecting
    the appellant's evidence, that this issue was not at the core, and that
    it made no difference.

 7. We asked Mr Chaudry to explain how any error might be material,  so  as
    to require a set aside, in absence  of  challenge  to  the  alternative
    finding at �59, based on availability of internal relocation.

 8. Mr Chaudry submitted that the adverse credibility finding led to  error
    in the assessment of risk on return; the assessment at �59 had a flawed
    starting point; the skeleton argument before the  FtT  had  dealt  with
    sufficiency of protection and internal flight; there might  be  general
    sufficiency of protection, but  that  was  subject  to  the  individual
    facts; and although no error could be found on the face  of  �59,  that
    might turn out differently if the issues were analysed from the correct
    starting point.

 9. We reserved our decision.

10. The decision up to �59 is based on rejecting the  appellant's  account,
    but �59 is based on the alternative that  everything  he  has  said  is
    true.  For purposes of further analysis, Mr Chaudry could not  ask  for
    any more favourable a starting point.

11. From that point, Mt Chaudry relied  only  on  legal  generalities,  but
    there is nothing to indicate that the judge was led astray by any error
    on a point of law.

12. This is what the judge said at �59:

         "I consider that in any event the appellant would have a  realistic
         internal flight alternative given that Pakistan has a population of
         more than 187 million people. The objective evidence suggests  that
         the Pakistan government generally does respect freedom of  movement
         and I do not consider that the non-state agents whom the  appellant
         claims to fear would be able to locate the  appellant,  who  is  an
         Urdu speaker, were he to go and live in a completely different part
         of Pakistan. I agree with paragraph 58 of the reasons  for  refusal
         letter that it simply cannot be accepted that Mr Masoud would  have
         either the means or the motive to trace the appellant  were  he  to
         move elsewhere in such a large and populous  country.  It  will  be
         remembered that in any event, the relevant events  apparently  took
         place, according to the appellant's account,  many  years  ago  and
         while I reject the appellant's credibility, I maintain that even if
         the appellant's account were true, there is no reasonable degree of
         likelihood that the appellant would  now  be  of  any  interest  to
         anyone in Pakistan."

13. Mr Chaudry was unable to refer to anything specific to the  case  which
    might have led the judge  to  another  conclusion,  based  on  positive
    credibility findings.

14. The paragraph is perhaps a little muddled as to whether  the  risk,  at
    highest, is one in respect of which legal sufficiency of protection  is
    available; whether it might persist after such lapse of  time;  whether
    it might exist throughout the country; and whether, if it  persists  in
    the appellant's home area, it is one which may  reasonably  be  avoided
    elsewhere.

15. There is, however, in the paragraph a reasoned  and  decisive  analysis
    which is not challenged by  anything  in  the  appellant's  grounds  or
    submissions:

    (i)    the appellant has a realistic alternative, in a country of  over
         187 million people;

    (ii)   freedom of movement is generally respected;

    (iii)  the non-state agents whom the appellant claims to fear would  be
         unable to locate him, there being no reason  to  accept  that  they
         have the means or motive to trace him elsewhere in such a large and
         populous country;

    (iv)   the relevant events took place many years ago; and

    (v)    even if the account were  true,  the  appellant  is  now  of  no
         interest to anyone.

16. Even at this very late stage,  we  would  have  considered  whether  to
    permit the appellant to raise a new ground of appeal, if  he  had  been
    able to outline some viable argument; but nothing was said by which the
    decision might conceivably have been set aside for error on a point  of
    law.

17. The judge erred by failing to deal with the appellant's denial of being
    found by immigration officers hiding in a basement, but that error does
    not require his decision to be set aside (a) because the point was  not
    material to the adverse credibility  finding,  which  would  have  been
    reached, irrespective of this error, for various stronger reasons,  and
    (b) because the case failed, even taken at its realistic  highest,  for
    the reasons given at �59, which are not undermined by anything  in  the
    grounds or further submissions.

18. The appeal to the UT is dismissed.  The decision  of  the  FtT  stands.



19. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
