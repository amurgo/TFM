Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms S Saifolahi
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is a citizen of Iraq born on 27  July  1989.  He  has  been
   given permission  to  appeal  against  the  determination  of  First-tier
   Tribunal  Judge  Grant-Hutchison  dismissing  his  appeal   against   the
   respondent's decision to refuse his application for leave to remain as  a
   Tier 2 (General) Migrant.

2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 21 September 2009 with  entry
   clearance conferring leave to enter as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant
   until 30 November 2010. On 8 December 2010 he was granted leave to remain
   as a Tier 1 (Post-Study) Migrant until 8 December  2012.  On  30  October
   2012 he applied for leave to remain as a Tier 2 (General)  Migrant  under
   the Points Based System.

3. The appellant's  application  was  refused  on  19  December  2012  under
   paragraph 245HD(f) and under Appendix A as he had failed to  achieve  the
   required points for Appropriate Salary. The reason for that was that  his
   Certificate of Sponsorship stated that his  prospective  employment  most
   closely corresponded to occupation code 2132 on  the  Codes  of  Practice
   specified under Appendix J of the  immigration  rules.  His  sponsor  had
   stated that his occupation most closely related to the occupation  of  an
   analyst programmer. The minimum acceptable rate of pay for  a  37.5  hour
   working week for his prospective employment was  �29,100  per  annum,  as
   stated in code 2132, but his certificate of Sponsorship stated  that  his
   salary would be �22,500 per annum. His prospective salary  was  therefore
   not at or above the minimum rate as specified in the  Codes  of  Practice
   and accordingly he was not awarded any points in that category.

4. In his grounds of  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  appellant
   stated that the decision had been made  in  reliance  on  his  employer's
   email of 30 November 2012 to the UKBA. However, as a result of the UKBA's
   failure to provide his employer with the full and correct list or updated
   Code of Practice, she  had,  in  error,  selected  the  role  of  Analyst
   Programmer from the limited choices available. Had she had the full list,
   there were two jobs that matched his role and for which he  received  the
   appropriate salary. His employer had set out her explanation for choosing
   the wrong job role in a  letter  dated  4  January  2013,  which  he  was
   enclosing. Had the correct job role been  selected,  his  current  salary
   would  have  met  the  Appropriate  Salary  requirements.  The  appellant
   enclosed, with his grounds of appeal, a copy of  an  email  sent  by  his
   employer to the UKBA, dated 31 December 2012, explaining her error.

5. In accordance with the appellant's request, his appeal was determined  on
   the papers, without an oral hearing, by the  First-tier  Tribunal.  Judge
   Grant-Hutchison considered that, in accordance with section  85A  of  the
   Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, he was unable to take  into
   account the letter from the appellant's employer, since it was not before
   the respondent at any time from  the  date  of  the  application  to  the
   decision. He found that the respondent could not be held responsible  for
   an employer rushing an application which she misunderstood  in  order  to
   complete the Certificate of Sponsorship and that the appellant could have
   checked the Code himself before submitting his application. He found that
   the respondent's decision was therefore in accordance with  the  law  and
   the immigration rules. He accordingly  dismissed  the  appeal  under  the
   immigration rules, although finding  that  the  accompanying  section  47
   removal decision was unlawful.

6. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  was  sought  on  the  grounds
   that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   should   have   considered   the
   respondent's evidential flexibility policy,  that  the  judge  failed  to
   recognise  that  the  respondent's  decision  was  flawed  by  reason  of
   procedural irregularity, and that the respondent had provided the  First-
   tier Tribunal with the wrong list of SOC codes and salaries.

7. Permission to appeal was granted on  26  April  2013,  primarily  on  the
   first ground.

Appeal hearing and submissions

8. In her submissions, Ms Saifolahi clarified the different  lists  of  jobs
   in the Codes  of  Practice,  which  was  reflected  in  Appendix  J,  and
   explained the order of events leading to the refusal of  the  appellant's
   application. The appellant's employer had been contacted by the  UKBA  to
   clarify the appellant's job description and she had erroneously responded
   by reference to the shorter list which was in  the  version  dated  April
   2012 rather than  the  wider  list  giving  more  choices.  Ms  Saifolahi
   submitted that the judge had erred by failing to consider the  evidential
   flexibility policy and the case of Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy)  [2013]
   UKUT 00042 in that respect. At paragraph 10  of  his  determination,  the
   judge erred in finding that the appellant could  have  checked  the  Code
   himself, since the Code used was correct. Furthermore, the respondent had
   acted unfairly by not contacting the appellant himself, as the evidential
   flexibility policy required. He  had  therefore  had  no  opportunity  to
   correct any errors. There was also unfairness  in  that  the  appellant's
   employer had not been informed by the UKBA why the enquiry was being made
   and the consequences of providing the wrong employment title and  neither
   had the employer been provided with the full list of occupations  or  the
   link to that list. Ms Saifolahi submitted that  these  were  all  matters
   that were relevant to an Article 8 consideration but no  such  assessment
   had been made by the judge.

9. Mr Deller submitted that this was not a  case  in  which  the  evidential
   flexibility policy  had  not  been  followed  by  the  respondent,  since
   enquiries had been made by the UKBA of the person who was expected to  be
   able to provide the correct information, namely the appellant's employer.
   It was reasonable for the employer, rather than the  appellant,  to  have
   been contacted, since she was the person who was best  placed  to  answer
   the query. It was not for the respondent to spoon-feed the applicant  and
   the respondent could not, therefore, be criticised for having  failed  to
   follow their own policy. This was not  a  Naved  (Student  -  fairness  -
   notice of points) [2012] UKUT 14 type  situation  since  the  appellant's
   employer was acting  in  his  interests.  An  Article  8  argument  would
   struggle  to  survive  alone,  without   there   being   any   unfairness
   established.

10. We advised the parties that, in our view, the judge had  made  an  error
   of law in his determination such that it had to be set aside and re-made.
   We also decided to re-make the decision by allowing  the  appeal  on  the
   basis that the respondent's decision was not in accordance with the  law.
   Our reasons for so finding are as follows.

Consideration and findings

11.  Whilst, in the absence of an  oral  hearing,  there  were  no  specific
   submissions made before the judge in regard to the evidential flexibility
   policy and Rodriguez or Article 8 of the  ECHR,  nor  grounds  of  appeal
   before him making specific reference to such issues, we consider that  it
   was  nevertheless  incumbent  upon  him  to  consider  them,  given   the
   circumstances of the  case  and  the  issues  that  were  raised  by  the
   appellant in his grounds of appeal. That is particularly  so,  given  the
   reference, in the written grounds, to the rules of natural justice and to
   the application being prejudiced, which ought indeed to have alerted  the
   judge to considerations of common law fairness, as laid  down  in  recent
   cases such as Naved. In the circumstances, and whilst he  properly  found
   that the appellant could not meet the specific requirements of the rules,
   we find that the judge erred by failing to go  on  to  consider  material
   matters, namely the evidential flexibility policy, fairness  and  Article
   8. As such, his decision has to be set aside.

12. In re-making the decision we agree with Mr Deller's submission that  the
   evidential flexibility policy does not require the UKBA to  nursemaid  or
   spoon-feed applicants and that, in the appellant's case, there  had  been
   regard to the policy. The appellant's employer had been contacted by  the
   UKBA to clarify his job role within the category of  Code  2132  and  had
   acted upon the response as set out in the email of 30 November 2012. This
   is not, therefore, a case that we believe involves a failure to  consider
   and apply the evidential flexibility policy. However, what we do find  is
   that it is one to which the principles of common law fairness  apply,  as
   expressed in the case of Naved, albeit in  different  circumstances,  and
   where we consider that there has been unfairness.

13. Whilst  we  would  not  disagree  with  the  findings  of  Judge  Grant-
   Hutchison, that the respondent cannot not  be  held  responsible  for  an
   employer rushing an application which she misunderstood, we do find  that
   the respondent must bear some responsibility in the advice they  give  in
   circumstances where, owing to the complex nature of the rules  they  have
   introduced, enquiries are made for clarification. It is  the  appellant's
   employer Ms Herbertson's evidence, in her letter of 11  June  2013,  that
   she telephoned the UKBA for assistance, after being asked to clarify  the
   appellant's job role, and told them that none of the role descriptions in
   the table she had before her matched the appellant's role  and  that  she
   was told to just pick one. It seems to us that, given the substantial and
   recent change in the Code of Practice, and the vastly increased range  of
   jobs and salaries in the Codes of Practice, within the Code 2132, and  in
   view of the particular concerns expressed  by  Ms  Herbertson,  that  the
   person with whom she was  making  her  enquiry  at  the  UKBA  bore  some
   responsibility in ensuring that she was looking at the correct  and  most
   up-to-date list rather than dealing with her in what she indicates in her
   letter to have been a somewhat perfunctory  manner.  There  has  been  no
   challenge to the explanation given by Ms Herbertson in her letter and  we
   see no reason not to accept her account of events. It seems that she  did
   everything she could do, acting upon the advice of the UKBA, and that the
   error in the job role she  chose  arose  not  so  much  because  she  was
   careless and rushed matters, but because she acted upon incorrect, or, at
   the very least, incomplete advice from the UKBA. As such, we  find  there
   was unfairness in the way in which the appellant's application was  dealt
   with by the UKBA.

14. We note what was said by the Upper Tribunal in their decision  in  Naved
   at paragraph 21:
    "21. ...Parliament enacted the exclusionary rule in s.85A  against  the
    background of the Secretary of State's duty to act fairly, and  in  the
    expectation that the duty would be complied with.

         22. Where that duty has not been complied with, the Tribunal  judge
    can so decide and allow the appeal on that ground.  In  such  cases  it
    remains for the respondent to make a lawful decision in  the  light  of
    the Tribunal's determination and  the  information  then  available  to
    her."

15.  We  consider  that  the  appellant's  circumstances  fall  within  this
   situation and we accordingly allow the  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the
   decision was not in accordance with the law. The appellant now  awaits  a
   fresh and lawful decision in his application. That  being  the  case,  we
   have not considered it appropriate to go on to consider Article 8.

DECISION

16. The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
   making of an error on a point of law. The decision has been set aside. We
   re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it to the  limited  extent
   as stated above.
