                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal  against  a  decision  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Somal dismissing an appeal against a refusal to vary leave.

 2. According to the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal,  the  Appellant  had
    failed to submit grounds of appeal.  According to the judge, directions
    were issued  to  the  Appellant  and  to  her  representative  on  10th
    September 2015 requiring  grounds  of  appeal  to  be  lodged  by  25th
    September 2015 but no grounds were submitted.

 3. The appeal was considered without a hearing.  The judge found  that  in
    the absence of any grounds of appeal there was no basis for  concluding
    that the decision by the Secretary of State was not made in  accordance
    with the Immigration Rules.

 4. In the application for  permission  to  appeal  it  is  contended  that
    grounds of appeal were submitted with the original  Notice  of  Appeal.
    The directions purportedly issued on 10th  September  2015  were  never
    received either by the Appellant or her solicitors.  On 14th  September
    2015 the solicitors sent an email to the Tribunal  requesting  an  oral
    hearing and this was acknowledged but not acted upon.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that there  were  grounds
    of appeal stated in the original Notice  of  Appeal  and  arguably  the
    judge erred by failing to have regard to these.  It was further  stated
    in the grant of leave that although it seemed unlikely that neither the
    Appellant nor the representatives would have received the direction, it
    was a possibility that the direction was never issued.

 6. At the commencement of the hearing before the Upper Tribunal I  pointed
    out to the parties I was the judge who granted  permission  to  appeal.
    The parties proceeded with the hearing in this knowledge.

 7. For the Appellant, Mr Khan relied on the grounds of the application for
    permission to appeal.  Mr Bramble had nothing  to  add  to  the  papers
    before me.

 8. I note that in the original Notice of Appeal  grounds  of  appeal  were
    inserted on page 9 in Box 3.  These state the following:

         "1.  The Appellant enjoys family life  with  her  nephew  which  is
             beyond normal emotional ties, in line with the test set out in
             Kugathas [2002] EWCA Civ 31.

           2.   The  Appellant  will  argue  that  interference   with   the
             relationship with her nephew is disproportionate.

          3.  The Appellant will argue that  in  reaching  the  decision  to
             refuse,  the  Secretary  of  State  failed  to  give  adequate
             consideration to affected third parties in line with case law.

          4.  Finally, the Appellant will show that the Secretary of State's
             assessment of the care provided by the Appellant to her nephew
             and the reason for it was inadequate."

 9. It is clear that the judge failed to have  regard  to  the  grounds  of
    appeal as submitted with the original Notice of Appeal.   By  so  doing
    the judge erred in law and the decision should be set aside.

10. There is in the appeal file a copy of the  directions  issued  on  10th
    September 2015 to both the Appellant  and  her  solicitors  asking  for
    grounds of appeal to be submitted.  While it appears that  this  notice
    was issued on that date, the notice  was  sent  out  in  error  because
    grounds of appeal had already been submitted with the Notice of Appeal.
     Accordingly, I attach no weight to the lack of any  response  to  this
    notice.

11. I further note from the appeal file that an email  was  sent  from  the
    Appellant's solicitors  on  14th  September  2015  requesting  an  oral
    hearing.  It is clear that although this email was stored in  the  file
    it did not come to the attention of the judge.  There appears from  the
    correspondence to be a factual dispute as to whether the Appellant  had
    paid a fee of �140 for an oral hearing or  �80  for  a  paper  hearing.
    This dispute does not appear to have been resolved and this may account
    for the fact that the  appeal  was  not  listed  for  oral  hearing  as
    requested.  The judge ought nevertheless to have been aware that such a
    request had been made.

12. In the circumstances, as the Appellant was denied proper  consideration
    of her appeal, there is no alternative but to remit the appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for a hearing before  a  different  judge  with  no
    findings preserved.

13. For the avoidance of doubt, I direct that the appeal be listed  for  an
    oral hearing.  In view of the way in which this matter has  been  dealt
    with by the First-tier Tribunal I should add that the decision to  list
    the appeal for an oral  hearing  is  made  by  judicial  direction  and
    therefore there should be no requirement for the Appellant to  pay  any
    additional fee, should the fee for an oral  hearing  not  already  have
    been paid.  In other words, the question of whether any additional  fee
    payable is closed.

14. There has been no application for any anonymity  order  and  I  see  no
    reason for making such an order.

Conclusions

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.


I set aside the decision.


The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  an  oral  hearing  by
judicial direction before a different judge with no findings preserved.   No
additional fee is payable.


Anonymity


The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order for anonymity and  I  make  no
order for the reasons set out above.
