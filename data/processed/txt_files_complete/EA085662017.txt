Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mrs A Kouma, Solicitor instructed by Migrant Legal
Action
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge N M K Lawrence who dismissed her appeal against the
    respondent's decision to refuse her a permanent right of  residence  by
    reference to Regulation 19 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2016.  The appellant is a Brazilian citizen and her husband
    is an EEA national because he is a Portuguese citizen.

 2. The parties met in 2006 but did not become a couple  until  they  began
    cohabiting on 28 August 2009.  They have two children born in 2010  and
    2015.   The appellant's permanent right of  residence  application  was
    submitted on 20 April 2017 and refused on 9 October 2017.   The  couple
    are still married but now estranged due to claimed domestic violence.

 3. The First-tier Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal.  At [13] in  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision he said that the  evidence  before
    him was that no income was declared by the  sponsor  in  2008/2009  and
    2009/2010.  From 2011/2014 there  was  income  ranging  from  �3000  to
    �14000, which he described as 'hardly an income to support oneself, let
    alone a family of four'.  There was no evidence of income in  2014/2015
    and no income declared in the following 2 years.

 4. The appellant nevertheless claims that the sponsor, whom  she  has  not
    divorced, has demonstrated that for five years of the time that he  has
    spent in the United Kingdom since 1998  he  was  working  and  that  he
    therefore acquired a right of permanent residence  in  accordance  with
    the Regulations.  Accordingly, the five years and more that the parties
    have been married give the appellant a  right  of  permanent  residence
    also.

 5. At [15], the First-tier Judge said that if the  five  continuous  years
    were said to start with 1998/1999 through to  2002/2003  the  appellant
    'could claim that [the sponsor]  had  exercised  Treaty  rights  for  a
    continuous 5 years' but noted at [16] that the appellant did  not  meet
    the sponsor until  2006,  beginning  to  cohabit  in  August  2009  and
    marrying him on 28 January 2013.  At [24], he noted that there  was  no
    evidence of  the  sponsor's  claimed  employment  in  the  5  years  to
    2002/2003.   It is impossible to tell from the decision, in  particular
    at [15], [17] and [24], whether the Judge concluded  that  the  sponsor
    did have a permanent right of residence.

 6.  The  Judge  considered  that  Regulation  10(5)(d)(iv),  the  domestic
    violence provision, was not applicable to the factual  matrix  in  this
    appeal, because that is only triggered where the  marital  relationship
    has ended, and an appellant is no longer a family member.  We think  he
    was right to do so:  following Baigazieva v Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1088, Regulation 10(5) is  not  engaged
    unless divorce proceedings have been lodged,  which  is  not  the  case
    here.

 7. In relation to the issue of permanent right of residence,  however,  we
    consider that the First-tier Judge's reasoning is unclear  and  we  are
    satisfied that it discloses a material error of law by  reason  of  the
    contradictory and inadequate findings of fact therein.  It must be  set
    aside.

 8. We have considered whether we could  proceed  to  remake  the  decision
    today but have  reluctantly  concluded  that  we  cannot  do  so.   The
    remaking of this decision requires further findings of fact.

 9. Accordingly, we set aside the decision in this appeal with no  findings
    of fact or credibility preserves, and we remit it for rehearing  afresh
    before a judge other than Judge N M K Lawrence.

DECISION

10. For the foregoing reasons, our decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law
    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside and will be remade
    in the First-tier Tribunal on a date to be fixed.
