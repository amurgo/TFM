Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms S Jones, Senior Presenting Officer
For the respondent:    Ms Jones of Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department and the
    respondents are citizens of Pakistan born on 5 May 1977  and  14  March
    1985 respectively.  However, for convenience,  I  refer  below  to  the
    respondents as the appellants and to the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
    respondent, which are the designations they had before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. I should also consider the first appellant's  appeal  because
    the second appellant's appeal rests or falls with  that  of  the  first
    appellant.

 2. The Secretary of State appeals with permission to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio  promulgated  on
    14 December 2018, allowing the appellants appeals against the decisions
    of the Secretary of State dated 1 June 2018 20 June  2018  respectively
    to refuse them leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

 3. Permission was granted  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Davies  who  in  a
    decision dated 11 February 2019 said that it is arguable that the Judge
    did not  apply  the  recommended  considerations  to  the  evidence  as
    indicated in the case  of,  R  (on  the  application  of  Khan)  v  the
    Secretary of State for the Home  Department  (dishonesty,  tax  return,
    paragraph 322 (5) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC).  Indeed the Judge  has  made
    no reference to the case, which in itself, it is arguable,  amounts  to
    an error of law.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge allowed the appellant's appeal and found that
    the respondent has discharged the initial burden of  proof  by  raising
    discrepancies in the tax figures. The amount is a considerable  sum  of
    money which was accepted by Mr Gajjar. The difference what was paid and
    what is due is about �17,000.

 5. The appellant's explanation for the discrepancy in figures was accepted
    by the Judge who found that Nafia Financial Services, who was hired  to
    file appellant's accounts with HMRC had made a big mistake.  The  Judge
    found it credible that the appellant looking at his payslip,  was  more
    concerned about his pay rather than how much tax had been deducted.  He
    also bore in mind that the second appellant had tuberculosis which is a
    serious disease and that they just had a baby which  could  have  taken
    his eye off the ball with regards to the 2012/2013 figures.

 6. The appellant's explained that his tax return  of  2010/2011  that  the
    turnover and business expenses  figure  in  this  tax  return  was  not
    correctly assessed  and  reported.  They  noticed  that  some  business
    expenditures were deducted twice in trading accounts by  one  of  their
    staff members, by using the incorrect formulas in Excel worksheet.  For
    the 2012/2013 tax return the appellant  provided  business  records  in
    different parts and the fact remains that  the  accountants  themselves
    did not enter it into Excel for calculations of the profit figures  for
    the  tax.  They  apologised  for  sending   incorrect   or   incomplete
    information to  HMRC.  The  Judge  found  the  appellant's  explanation
    innocent.  the  appellant  was  entitled  to  trust  the  work  of  his
    accountants and at best it can only show that he was a bit careless for
    not verifying the figures  for  the  cost  to  him  which  she  clearly
    admitted were done instead of just signing the tax  form.  carelessness
    does not amount to dishonesty

 7. The HMRC has accepted the amendments made by  the  appellant  and  have
    imposed no penalty upon him and the appellant who is  now  amended  his
    tax return.

 8. The Judge allowed both appellants  appeals  and  said  that  they  have
    satisfied the requirements of paragraph 276 B of the immigration  rules
    and the respondent has not successfully shown that  paragraph  322  (5)
    applies to  the  appellant's  case.  He  allowed  their  appeals  under
    "Article 8".

    Grounds of appeal

 9. The respondent's grounds of appeal which I summarise are the following.
    The appellant's applications for indefinite leave under paragraph  276B
    of the immigration rules was refused under paragraph  322  (5)  of  the
    immigration rules. This was due to the discrepancies in the appellant's
    declared income to HMRC for tax purposes and the UKVI  in  his  further
    leave applications.

10. The first-tier Tribunal Judge failed to  apply  the  reasoning  of  the
    upper Tribunal in the case of R (on the application  of  Khan)  of  the
    Secretary of State for the Home  Department  (dishonesty,  tax  return,
    paragraph 322 (5) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC) when  assessing  whether  the
    appellant cited dishonesty relations to his dealings UKVI or HMRC.

11. The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not follow the recommended  steps  in
    Khan when assessing the appellant's  actions  and  absolved  the  first
    appellant of any responsibility to ensure his tax returns are  correct.
    The Judge has not provided reasons for why  it  is  accepted  that  the
    appellant would not have been aware of the errors sooner given that his
    tax liability would have been  significantly  lower  than  expected  by
    �17,000. There is also no  finding  relating  to  why  the  significant
    discrepancy was not rectified by the appellant sooner,  given  that  he
    would have personally received this tax bill self-employed person.  The
    Judge  therefore  has  materially  erred  in  the  assessment  of   the
    appellant's actions.

12. The Judge also materially erred in his approach at paragraph 23 of  the
    decision by finding that the actions of HMRC as being determinative  of
    the appellant's actions, given that they have not imposed  any  penalty
    or take any action. This approach is not correct.

13. Reliance is placed on the findings of  the  Upper  Tribunal  judge  the
    judicial review case of R (on the application of Samat) v Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2017] UKAIT JR and Abbasi  JR/13807/2016
    where there were findings relating to the relevance of the actions that
    HMRC makes against the appellant.

14. Both cases state that whether HMRC takes punitive  action  or  not,  is
    neither here or there. It states that there  are  several  reasons  why
    HMRC would not take action against a particular person. Therefore,  the
    treatment of reviews by HMRC is not relevant to  322  (5)  assessments,
    and in any event, does not address the possibility  that  the  original
    tax records were correct, but the appellant falsified  higher  earnings
    for his application under Tier 1.

    The hearing

15. At the hearing both parties make submissions whether there is an  error
    of law.

    Findings as to whether there is an error of law

16. There  was  no  dispute  that  there  was  a  discrepancy  between  the
    appellant's income which was declared to HMRC in his  tax  returns  and
    the income that he declared to UKVI for his  further  leave  to  remain
    applications.

17. The Judge did not take into account the recent case of Khan as  to  how
    to assess  cases  where  they  are  discrepancies  between  the  income
    declared to HMRC and the income declared  to  the  respondent  for  his
    applications.  The  Judge  clearly  found  that  the   respondent   had
    discharged his burden of proof. Therefore, it  was  for  the  Judge  to
    analyse the evidence and find whether there was an innocent explanation
    for the discrepancy of �17,000.

18. The Judge within the guidance given in Khan had to analyse whether  the
    explanation for the error by the accountant was plausible, whether  any
    documents which can be assumed to exist such as correspondence  between
    the applicant his accountant at the time of the  tax  return  has  been
    disclosed.  He  also  has  to  assess  whether  there  is  a  plausible
    explanation for why such documentation is missing. The Judge  also  has
    to assess why the appellant did not realise the  error  sooner  because
    his liability to pay tax was less than  he  should  have  expected  and
    whether at any stage have been taken steps to remedy the situation and,
    if  so,  when  the  steps  were  taken  and  the  explanation  for  any
    significant delay.

19. The Judge materially erred in not analysing  the  appellant's  evidence
    with respect to  how  to  approach  the  appellant's  case  within  the
    guidance given in the case of Khan. Had the judge done so, he may  have
    come to a different conclusion on the evidence in this appeal.

20. The Judge also erred in finding that because the HMRC has not taken any
    punitive steps against the appellant, this somehow goes  in  favour  of
    the appellant. The case law set out by the respondent in his grounds of
    appeal, make it quite clear that the fact that the HMRC has not  issued
    a penalty notice is neither here or there, because there could be  many
    reasons why HMRC had not do so. Therefore, the Judge fell into error by
    considering failure by the HMRC to issue a penalty notice as  something
    favourable for the appellant.

21. I find that the judge has not given cogent reasons for why he  believed
    the appellant's explanation for the difference of �17,000  which  is  a
    substantial amount of money to be inconsistent about.

22. I therefore direct the appeal be remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal's
    findings of fact to be made against the criteria and guidance  set  out
    in the case of  Khan.  The  appeal  be  placed  before  any  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge other than Judge Adio for a hearing de novo.







    Decision




23. The appeal by the Secretary of State is allowed and the decision of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge is set aside.  I remit the appeal to the
    First-tier Tribunal.
