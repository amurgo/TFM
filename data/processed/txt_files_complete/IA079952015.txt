                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Nicol,  promulgated  24th  July  2015,  following  a  hearing  at
    Manchester  on  10th  June  2015.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed the  appeal  of  Chukwuyem  Usifo,  whereupon  the  Appellant
    applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of Nigeria, who was born  on  23rd
    October 1986.  She appeals  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State, dated 9th February 2015, refusing  her  application
    for leave to remain in the UK on  the  basis  of  her  marriage  to  Mr
    Owunari Preston Wekema, under Article 8 of the ECHR.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge had regard to the essential facts, namely, that the Appellant
    entered the UK on 22nd August 2002 as  a  visitor,  but  then  on  14th
    August 2004 applied for indefinite leave to remain  as  a  child  of  a
    person present and settled  in  the  UK.   This  was  refused  and  the
    Appellant was  issued  with  a  removal  notice,  and  her  appeal  was
    subsequently dismissed on 24th February 2009.

 4. In December 2009 she applied for human rights under Articles  3  and  8
    and this appeal was refused on 6th April 2010.  She  then  applied  for
    Article 8 rights and this was refused on 3rd July 2013.  On 2nd  August
    2014, she applied for leave to remain as the spouse of  Mr  Wekema  and
    this was refused on 8th September 2014.  The Appellant had now remained
    in the UK for twelve years and has family here.  Her claim is that  she
    considers the UK as her home and does consider that she has  sufficient
    links in Nigeria.

 5. She is now married.  She  has  a  private  life  here.   She  has  good
    character and is not a burden on the State.  She also  states  that  it
    would be difficult for her husband to relocate to  Nigeria  as  he  was
    born in the UK and has family here (see paragraphs 9 to 10).  The judge
    also went on to say that she herself had a sister and a half brother in
    the UK (see paragraph 11).

 6. The judge went on to give consideration to paragraph 276ADE of Appendix
    FM and held that the Appellant could not succeed under this preparation
    and the judge was not satisfied that there were  significant  obstacles
    that would prevent the Appellant's integration  into  Nigeria,  despite
    the fact that her husband had only been back for  a  short  holiday  to
    Nigeria (see paragraph 18).

 7. The judge recognised that the Appellant and her husband do have  family
    and private life in this country (see  paragraph  20).   However,  they
    could continue with their family and private life in Nigeria (paragraph
    20).

 8. Finally,  the  judge  had  regard  to  the  existence  of  "exceptional
    circumstances" and concluded that, "I do not find there are exceptional
    circumstances warranting the consideration of this matter  outside  the
    Rules" (paragraph 21).  That being  so,  the  matter  was  disposed  of
    purely on the basis of the Immigration Rules and the jurisprudence with
    respect to family and private life  was  considered  on  the  basis  of
    Razgar (see paragraph 22) and the judge concluded that the decision  by
    the Respondent Secretary of State was a proportionate one.

 9. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

10. The grounds of application state that the judge failed to  have  regard
    to  the  "best  interests  of  the  child"   and   the   "compassionate
    circumstances" as well as to the fact that the judge did  not  consider
    Section 117B of Part 5 to the Immigration Act 2014.

11. On 9th January 2016, permission to appeal was granted on the basis that
    the Appellant did not have the benefit of legal  representation  before
    Judge Nicol.  The judge did not give adequate reasons for the  findings
    on material matters.  It was  necessary  to  have  specific  regard  to
    Section 117A to D of the NIAA 2002 and in particular  to  the  case  of
    Dube [2015] UKUT 00090.  Finally, although the judge was  not  required
    to  consider  the  "best  interests"  of  a  child   as   yet   unborn,
    nevertheless, that the Appellant's seven month pregnancy was  something
    that should have been taken into  consideration  with  respect  to  the
    reasonableness of her return to her country of origin.

Submissions

12. At  the  hearing  before  me  on  24th  May  2016,  the  Appellant  was
    unrepresented  once  again,  and  simply  stated  that  she   met   the
    requirements of Appendix FM, and the judge should have  considered  the
    fact that she was pregnant, especially as she was not a burden upon the
    State, was self-sufficient in being able to show the ï¿½18,600  financial
    threshold requirement, as well  as  being  able  to  meet  the  English
    language test requirements.

13. For his part, Mr McVeety submitted that where  the  Appellant's  appeal
    failed ultimately was on the question of whether freestanding Article 8
    jurisprudence applied.  The judge took the view that, "I  do  not  find
    there are exceptional circumstances warranting the consideration of the
    matter outside of the Rules" (paragraph 21).  As  a  consequence,  only
    paragraph 276ADE was considered of 27.  The way in which the judge  had
    applied the Rules was not something that could be criticised.   At  the
    time the Appellant could not meet the requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Now she can.  If that is the case then she has 28 days from the
    date of this decision to make a fresh application, and this is what she
    should do.

14. In reply, the Appellant stated that she should not be required to  make
    a fresh application.  She said that she could not have returned back to
    Nigeria even then, in a highly pregnant state of seven months,  as  she
    was receiving medical care at the time.  Moreover, the  judge  has  not
    had regard to Part 5A of the Immigration Act 2014,  and  in  particular
    the fact that Section 117 does not militate against  her  but  actually
    assist her.  There was no public interest requiring her to go  back  to
    Nigeria.



No Error of Law

15. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law  (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCE
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision.   My  reasons  are  as
    follows.  This is a case where the judge has held that, "I do not  find
    that there are exceptional circumstances warranting  the  consideration
    of this matter outside  the  Rules"  (paragraph  21).   This  begs  the
    question as to why not.   The  Appellant  could  not  comply  with  the
    Immigration Rules.  Yet, she had been in this country for twelve years,
    was married to Mr Kumara, who had been born  and  brought  up  in  this
    country, and who could not relocate to Nigeria, on  the  basis  of  the
    evidence that he gave, and had only been there for a short holiday, and
    she was heavily pregnant.  She also  had  her  entire  family  in  this
    country, with the exception of her father who was  in  Mauritania  (see
    paragraph 11).  She had a private and family life in this country.  The
    failure in these circumstances to consider the second  stage  and  take
    into consideration freestanding Article 8 jurisprudence was an error of
    law.  Moreover, it is not clear why Section 117 was not  given  a  full
    and proper consideration, even in the context of the Immigration  Rules
    which were considered, because this would  have  affected  the  way  in
    which the "Razgar principles" were then  evaluated  by  the  judge  (at
    paragraph 22).  For all these reasons, there is an error of law.

Remaking the Decision

16. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing this appeal to the extent  that  it  is  remitted
    back to a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal other than Judge Nicol under
    Practice Statement 7.2(b) the nature or extent of  any  judicial  fact-
    finding which is necessary in order for the decision in the  appeal  to
    be remade is such that having regard to  the  overriding  objective  in
    Rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.
     I direct that the matter be heard by a judge other than Judge Nicol.


Notice of Decision

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    submitted back to a judge of the First-tier Tribunal other  than  Judge
    Nicol to be heard at the first available opportunity.

18. No anonymity direction is made.
