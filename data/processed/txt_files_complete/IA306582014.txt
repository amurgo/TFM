Representation:
Appellant   Mr Sellwood, Counsel, instructed by Debridge Solicitors
Respondent  Mr Stanton (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria. The appellant came to the United
    Kingdom as a student on July 22, 2008. She was allowed to  extend  that
    leave until September 28, 2009 and thereafter  she  was  granted  post-
    study leave until September 2, 2011. On August 16, 2011 she applied  to
    remain on article 8 ECHR grounds but this was refused  and  her  appeal
    was dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal  on  November  11,  2011  with
    appeals rights exhausted on December 23, 2011. The appellant asked  for
    reconsideration on January 26, 2012 and  was  later  served  with  Form
    IS151A on October 16, 2002. The respondent considered her  request  and
    on July 12, 2014 refused her application.

 2. The appellant appealed this decision on July 24,  2014,  under  section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 3. The appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal JHH  Cooper  on
    May 29, 2015 and in a decision promulgated  on  June  23,  2015  he/she
    refused the appeal under the Immigration Rules and article 8 ECHR.

 4. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on July 7, 2015 submitting:

      a. The Judge had erred by conflating the tests  for  Section  EX.1  of
         Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and article 8 ECHR.

      b. The Judge failed to have regard to the medical evidence.

      c. The Judge failed to  consider  the  appellant's  extensive  private
         life.

 5. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Simpson  gave  permission  to  appeal
    particularly with regard to the Judge's approach to article 8 ECHR.

 6. The matter came before me on the above date  and  I  heard  submissions
    from both representatives.

 7. Mr Stanton, having heard Mr Sellwood's submissions, accepted there  was
    an error in law in respect of grounds one and three of the  grounds  of
    appeal and that the matter should be reheard. He disputed any error  in
    so far as ground two was concerned and  invited  me  to  preserve  that
    finding.

 8. Mr Sellwood invited me to find an error  in  law  on  all  grounds.  He
    submitted the Judge's approach to  Section  EX.1  of  Appendix  FM  was
    flawed because he had intertwined  his  findings  with  his  article  8
    assessment.  In  particular,  he  submitted  the  Judge's  approach  in
    paragraphs [38] and [39] demonstrated an error in approach because  the
    Judge highlighted the approach in Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40 which
    is a case relevant to article 8 only. The Judge erred in  his  approach
    to  article  8  ECHR  because  there  was  no  proper   proportionality
    assessment and in particular the Judge had no regard to the appellant's
    private life and the effect she had had on  the  local  community.  The
    Judge' approach on documents was also arguably flawed. Turning  to  the
    medical evidence he submitted  the  Judge's  approach  to  the  medical
    evidence was flawed and the finding should be set aside.

 9. Having considered the submissions I agreed there was an error in law in
    so far as grounds one and three were concerned but found  no  error  of
    law in respect of Ground two.

10. The Judge approached the  Immigration  Rules  and  article  8  ECHR  as
    indicated in paragraph [37]. Although the courts have made  clear  that
    there is a two stage the Judge approached both issues as one and whilst
    I agree that factors in the Section EX.1 consideration are  similar  to
    those in article 8 ECHR the emphasis under the Rules  is  different  to
    the approach under article 8 ECHR with the Tribunal considering whether
    there are insurmountable obstacles to family  life  continuing  outside
    the United Kingdom whereas article 8 ECHR is of course a  consideration
    of the whole picture and whether it would be  proportionate  to  remove
    the appellant. The Judge found it would not be reasonable to expect the
    sponsor to leave the country  and  return  to  Nigeria  but  failed  to
    consider whether there were insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    continuing outside the United Kingdom.

11. The Judge's approach to article 8 failed to  have  any  regard  to  the
    appellant's private life. It may well be that it would be proportionate
    to remove her but as stated in Razgar [2004] UKHL 00027 the Judge  must
    consider proportionality and he must now have regard  to  section  117B
    factors (contained in Section 117B of the 2002  Act).   As  Mr  Stanton
    helpfully indicated the Judge failed to do this.

12. For the above reasons I find there was an error in law  in  respect  of
    both the Immigration Rules and article 8 ECHR and  I  set  aside  those
    decisions.

13. As regards the Judge's approach to the medical evidence I do  not  find
    any error in the approach taken. Paragraph [41] makes it clear how  the
    evidence was considered and in the absence of any  material  change  in
    his circumstances I see no reason to re-visit that aspect of  the  case
    but ultimately that would be a matter for  the  Judge  re-hearing  this
    appeal. I merely make clear that the current medical evidence does  not
    support any suggestion that the sponsor is in need  of  any  real  care
    bearing in mind he is able to work full-time as a taxi driver.

14. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

         "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement
         Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal to the Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
         Tribunal finds that the making of the decision  concerned  involved
         the making of an error on a point of law, the  Upper  Tribunal  may
         set aside the decision and, if it does so, must  either  remit  the
         case to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)  or
         proceed (in accordance with relevant Practice  Directions)  to  re-
         make the decision under section 12(2)(b)(ii).

         The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed to re-
         make the decision, instead of remitting the case to the  First-tier
         Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:ï¿½

          a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
             First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for
             that party's case to be put to and considered  by  the  First-
             tier Tribunal; or

          b) the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
             necessary in order for the decision in the appeal  to  be  re-
             made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
             in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to  the  First-
             tier Tribunal.

    Remaking rather than remitting will nevertheless constitute the  normal
    approach to determining appeals where an error of law is found, even if
    some further fact finding is necessary."

15. In light of the Practice  Direction  I  agreed  the  matter  should  be
    remitted t back to the First-tier Tribunal.

16. It goes without saying that once that date has been fixed the appellant
    should serve on both the Tribunal and the respondent an updated  bundle
    of evidence that is to be relied on.

DECISION

17. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law. I have set aside the decision.

18. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    appeal  hearing  under  Section  12  of  the  Tribunals,   Courts   and
    Enforcement Act 2007.
