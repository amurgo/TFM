Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms V Easty, instructed by Howe & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge A
    M Black, promulgated on 23rd April 2019, in which she  dismissed  their
    appeal against the refusal of entry clearance to join their mother  the
    widow of a former Gurkha solider who is settled in the UK.  That  entry
    clearance decision was dated 10th April 2018.

 2. The application for permission to appeal was made on three grounds.

 3. Ground 1 advanced that there was an application of an unlawful test  in
    the determination of whether family life existed between the appellants
    and their parents.  When rejecting family life between  the  appellants
    and the mother in the UK, the judge found at paragraphs 36 and 38  that
    she was unable  to  find  the  remitted  funds  constituted  "real  and
    effective support" bearing in mind the funds were  given  to  all  four
    siblings and at paragraph 38 that  "what  the  funds  remitted  by  the
    sponsor are, whilst useful to the appellants, not a significant part of
    their income taking into account their circumstances".

 4. The appellants contended that the applicable authority was Rai v  Entry
    Clearance Officer (New Delhi) [2017] EWCA  Civ  320,  where  the  court
    reviewed the proper approach to be taken to the  assessment  of  family
    life.  At paragraph 17 Rai referred to Kugathas such that if dependency
    was  read  down  as  meaning  "support"  and  if  one  adds  "real"  or
    "committed" or "effective" to the words of "support" then it represents
    the irreducible minimum of what that family life implies.  It was clear
    from Rai that the requirement was real or effective  or  committed  not
    real and effective.  The adjectives are alternatives and  by  requiring
    the descriptive as being conjunctive the judge unlawfully added a gloss
    to the Article 8 test.

 5. Ground 2 maintained that there was an unstainable  finding  as  to  the
    extent of the financial  support.   The  judge  acknowledged  that  the
    appellants received support in the  form  of  their  accommodation  but
    stated "however the land was purchased with charitable funds  given  to
    the family as a whole to provide them with accommodation and to  enable
    them to grow vegetables for themselves" [paragraph 33 of the  sponsor's
    witness statement].  They were not, thus,  found  to  be  dependant  on
    their mother for the provision of accommodation  [paragraph  30].   The
    judge added that the amount she had been told that the three men earned
    per day but she had not been told of their average  monthly  or  weekly
    income.  Nor had she been told of the amount of their expenses  or  the
    proportion of the siblings' income which was provided by  the  sponsor.
    The appellants lived in the family  home  which  on  the  evidence  was
    purchased using charitable funds donated  to  the  family.   The  judge
    found at

         "35.     Another gap in the evidence relates to the earnings of the
             three men of the household, including  the  first  and  second
             appellants.  I have been told the amount the  three  men  earn
             per day and that they do not pay tax but I have not been  told
             their average monthly or weekly income.  Nor have I been  told
             the  amount  of  their  expenses  or  the  proportion  of  the
             siblings' income  which  is  provided  by  the  sponsor.   The
             appellants live in the family home which, on the evidence, was
             purchased using charitable funds donated to the  family.   The
             appellants do  not  pay  rent.   Their  outgoings  are  fairly
             modest, particularly as they grow their own vegetables.  While
             I accept that the earnings of the three  men  are  meagre  and
             arise from part-time work, as and when it  is  available,  the
             evidence does not demonstrate that the  sponsor's  remittances
             (which are sent for the use of the four siblings,  not  merely
             the  appellants)  constitute  a  significant  part  of   their
             income."

 6. The judge at paragraph 46 overall found that she was unable to find the
    sponsor's financial contribution to the appellant's maintenance and the
    provision of accommodation by way of the family home was sufficient  to
    demonstrate a bond which was over and above the norm for a  mother  and
    her adult children whose ages ranged between 32 and 38 years [46].

 7. It was asserted that the judge had misdirected herself with regards  to
    the accommodation.  It was the land which had been  purchased  for  the
    family by a charity and not the accommodation and no reference had been
    made to the charity having purchased the appellant's accommodation.

 8. Further, in concluding that the sponsor's support did not constitute  a
    significant part  of  the  appellant's  income,  the  judge  failed  to
    properly make reasoned finding.  It was accepted that only two  members
    of the household were working (paragraph 26 of the  determination)  and
    that they were earning approximately �1.50 per  day.   It  was  equally
    accepted at paragraph 33 that the sponsor  provided  approximately  �80
    per month.  On proper calculation, even if  the  team  members  of  the
    household worked every day of each month their collective income  would
    have amounted to  �90  per  month.   It  was  thus  apparent  that  the
    sponsor's  contribution  was  approximately  half  of  the  appellant's
    monthly income.

 9. Ground 3 took issue with the judge's  approach  to  the  right  of  the
    appellants to enter the UK on article 8 grounds.  At paragraphs  49  to
    51 of the determination, the judge concluded that  given  the  mother's
    polygamous marriage until the  death  of  the  sister  the  appellants'
    father would not have been permitted to bring the mother to the  UK  on
    his  discharge.   Entry  Clearance  would  have  been  granted  to  the
    sponsor's sister not the sponsor.  It  was  submitted  that  the  judge
    erred in the alternative finding because there was no  suggestion  that
    the sponsor's polygamous marriage was not lawful in Nepal at  the  time
    and it followed pursuant to the principle of lex loci and celebrationis
    that  the  sponsor's  marriage  was  lawful.   These  issues  were  not
    addressed in the refusal permission.

    Permission to appeal

10. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that it was arguable that
    the judge based her assessment on whether real, committed or  affective
    support was provided by the sponsor on an  erroneous  factual  premise.
    The judge made a  mistake  as  to  the  material  fact  which  arguably
    resulted in unfairness to  the  appellants  and  infected  the  overall
    conclusion as to the depth and quality of the relationship between  the
    appellants and sponsor.  Arguably the judge made  an  assumption  about
    which of the sponsor's late husband's two wives would apply  for  entry
    clearance and failed to take into consideration the  principle  of  lex
    loci and celebrationis. Ground 1 was considered to have less merit that
    permission was granted on all grounds.

    The hearing

11. At the hearing before me Mr Melvin apologised for the lack of  Rule  24
    decision but considered that the judge was entitled  to  conclude  that
    there was no family life.  The mother had been in the UK for five years
    and there was no evidence of her return.  Three of the four adults were
    working and that the finding of family life  was  not  warranted.   The
    case had been  lawfully  considered  and  that  there  is  no  evidence
    regarding the standard of living.

    Analysis

12. I find there was an error of law in the assessment of the family  life.
    It was accepted by the judge that the family had lived  together  until
    the mother had come to the UK four years previously.  The assessment of
    the family life involved  an  error  in  assessment  of  the  financial
    support.  It is  clear  from  paragraph  17  of  Rai  which  references
    Kugathas that if dependency is read down as meaning  "support"  in  the
    personal sense and if  one  added  echoing  Strasbourg's  jurisprudence
    "real" or "committed" or "effective" to  the  word  "support"  then  it
    represents the irreducible minimum of what family life implies.  As  Ms
    Easty submitted there is not a higher hurdle to evidence  family  life.
    The judge added a gloss by applying the test conjunctively.

13. The appellants in this case are near relatives of the mother with  whom
    they lived until as recently as four years ago and of whom  all  remain
    single.  It was further accepted by  the  judge  that  the  mother  was
    saving up for the application fees for the appellants  rather  than  to
    spend the money visiting them and this did  not  undermine  the  family
    life.

14. There is no presumption of family life but the  financial  contribution
    was, as regards ground 2  of  the  appeal,  erroneously  assessed.   No
    mention in the witness  statement  was  made  by  the  sponsor  to  the
    accommodation being provided by a charity.  It was the family home.  Mr
    Melvin  submitted  that  there  were  no  deeds  in  relation  to  this
    accommodation but that was not a matter which was taken by  the  judge,
    who merely stated that it had been provided by the  charity  which  had
    not been the case and contrary  to  the  sponsor's  witness  statement.
    there was clear evidence of significant financial contribution and that

15. As set out in Rai at paragraph 19 "the question whether  an  individual
    enjoys  family  life  is  one  of  fact  and  depends  on   a   careful
    consideration of all the relevant factors of a  particular  case."   In
    some instances an adult child who does not have a partner may establish
    he has family life with his parents; "it all  depends  on  the  facts".
    There must be an accurate assessment of those facts,  however,  and  in
    view of the finding by the judge, which noted contrary to  Mr  Melvin's
    submission, that in fact only two of the appellants  were  working  not
    three, that needed to be factored in.  As pointed out in the grounds if
    the judge accepted that two appellants were working for  �1.50  a  day,
    the contribution from the mother of �90 per  month  was  a  significant
    contribution.

16. I consider that the errors identified in grounds 1 and 2 are  made  out
    and that proper assessment should be so undertaken.  On ground 3, as Ms
    Easty pointed out, this was not an issue taken in the refusal of  entry
    clearance and the appellants were not disputed to be  the  children  of
    the deceased Gurkha and would be able to benefit  from  the  historical
    injustice on the basis of family life.  Whether or  not  the  ex-Gurkha
    father had more than one wife, the fact is these are still his children
    and would be able to benefit from the historic injustice.  Even  if  he
    would not have been permitted to bring the appellant's mother to the UK
    they were still his children.  Contrary to Jitendra Rai the judge  also
    appeared to apply Section  117  of  the  2002  Act  finding  that  this
    outweighed the  degree  of  interference  in  this  family's  protected
    rights.

17. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified. I set aside  the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and extent
    of the findings to be made the matter should be remitted to the  First-
    tier Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007  and  further
    to 7.2 (b) of the Presidential Practice Statement.


No anonymity direction is made.
