                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr E Nicholson, Counsel, No 5 Chambers
For the Respondent:    Miss J Isherwood, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of Jordan,  date  of  birth  19  March  1986,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision, dated 9 December  2014,  to
    refuse further leave to remain outside of the Rules.  The  appeal  came
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge J H L Shepherd (the Judge) who, on  19
    August 2015, dismissed the appeal under the Rules and with reference to
    Articles 3 and 8 ECHR.  No anonymity direction was made.

2.   Permission to appeal was originally refused on 8 January 2016  but  was
    granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins on 21 June 2016  on  the  basis
    that the First-tier Tribunal had erred by  failing  to  apply  Sections
    117A and 117B of the NIAA 2002.   It  was  also  less  clear  that  the
    alleged error of  law  is  material  but  given  the  most  unfortunate
    circumstances of the Appellant's health permission was given out of  an
    abundance of caution.

3.   Mr Nicholson's careful skeleton argument  essentially  focuses  on  two
    issues. First, the absence of reference to the important role played by
    the Appellant's sister in his care and as part of his  normal  life  in
    the UK.  Secondly, a failure properly to consider the  potential  risks
    the Appellant faces on a return to  Jordan.   If  he  was  in  need  of
    further medical treatment for his condition of cancer he would have but
    one hospital to turn to, the King Hussain Cancer Centre in Amman.   The
    previous medical treatment he had received there particularly by way of
    chemotherapy had been so poorly given that he had sustained  heart  and
    lung damage.  The Appellant was particularly fearful of a repetition of
    poor clinical treatment.  His fear is to a degree  exacerbated  by  the
    excellent treatment which he has received in the  United  Kingdom  from
    which he has benefited.

4.   Miss Isherwood argues that in effect the judge took  into  account  the
    Appellant's evidence concerning his reliance upon his sister by way  of
    his statement dated 7 July 2015, paragraph 8, and  a  letter  from  the
    Appellant's sister dated 4 September 2014 in which  she  spoke  of  the
    support which she has given her twin brother, the Appellant, whilst  he
    has been in the United Kingdom.  She is in the United Kingdom as a Tier
    1 Migrant and her current leave to remain expires in about  the  middle
    of 2017.

5.   Miss Isherwood also argues that whatever may  have  been  the  position
    vis-ï¿½-vis the medical treatment the Appellant received  in  Jordan  the
    fact is that he did receive treatment and can still receive  treatment.
    It is inappropriate for him to simply, in the light of  the  case  law,
    rely on the just service which he has obtained in the  United  Kingdom.
    Accordingly, it is said that that treatment does not give rise  to  the
    real likelihood of a breach of Article 3  ECHR  or  indeed  Article  8,
    insofar as that is applicable, on a return to Jordan.

6.   It is clear from the careful decision of the judge that  a  great  deal
    of time was taken over the evidence and consideration of it bearing  in
    mind the Appellant was in person.  There was no representative from the
    Home Office.  It perhaps speaks even better of the  decision  that  the
    care that was given by the judge  to  ensure  a  consideration  of  the
    issues led to a reasonable repetition and summarising  of  the  medical
    evidence which is not substantially challenged.

7.   The statement of the Appellant which was before the judge said:-

         "My sister is the only person who can take care of me as stated  in
         her reference letter and the solicitor stated it in my  first  page
         of the initial application page. On top of that my  father  is  too
         old and he has several health conditions himself, last month he did
         his hip replacement surgery, so he can't take care of me as well."

8.   It is clear that there is really no greater  particulars  at  least  in
    written form of the care provided to the Appellant by his sister.   She
    in her letter of September 2014 says as much:

         "In his personal life, Hamzeh has many friends, among  whom  he  is
         quite well respected and liked. He never has  a  bad  word  to  say
         about anyone, and his kindness and generosity are unparalleled.   I
         am certain that the difficulties that  Hamzeh  has  challenged  has
         made him a person that given the right chances and  environment  he
         will succeed and maintain to be a good contributor to the  society.
         I am residing  in  the  UK  permanently  and  I  will  be  divested
         [devastated] if Hamzeh went back to  Jordan,  as  he  is  the  only
         person I can rely on and trust. Also I want to make sure I am there
         for him in case his cancer came back. Hamzeh  went  through  a  lot
         while he was receiving his treatment in the UK, I don't want him to
         suffer again."  (my parenthesis)

9.   The reference to the sister in the judge's decision  (D42)  essentially
    is this.

         "During the time he has lived with his sister  here  on  a  limited
         visa, and that is a family relationship formed, obviously, in their
         home state of in Jordan. Family and friends remain in Jordan. There
         is nothing to suggest his removal would interfere with these family
         relationships such as to breach his protected rights under  Article
         8."

10.  The judge goes on to consider private life.

11.  It seems to me that the judge understood  the  evidence  and  certainly
    gathered what the parties were saying about it.  I find it likely  that
    any reasonable Tribunal looking  at  that  evidence  would  come  to  a
    similar decision, namely that the removal of the  Appellant  would  not
    give rise to the likelihood of an interference of, such significance as
    to engage Article 8 or if it did, the nature  of  the  relationship  is
    disproportionate. Accordingly I find that the judge made  no  error  of
    law on that issue.

12.  The argument which I think attracts Mr Richardson significantly is  the
    deficiencies in the medical treatment which the Appellant  received  in
    Jordan and its consequences now were he to need further treatment of  a
    similar kind.  It seems to me that he [Mr Nicholson], is elevating that
    level of risk to an obligation on the United Kingdom to ensure that the
    Appellant remains so that the possible need for treatment would be  met
    in the UK and it would be better here.

13.  I am unable to comment upon the expert evidence such  as  it  may  have
    been as to the prognosis and as to the risks that might be faced  on  a
    return.  It seems to me, no one taking me to such material that  before
    the judge, there simply was not evidence as to the real  likelihood  of
    that being a risk within any reasonably contemplated  period  of  time.
    To that end that is not a criticism of the judge but simply the absence
    of evidence to reach and support that conclusion of the  real  risk  of
    the need for treatment and if given the likelihood of  engaging  either
    Article 3 or Article 8 ECHR.

14.  This is a truly unfortunate case and no one  could  have  anything  but
    sympathy for the Appellant in the predicament and health that he is in.
     However, it seems to me that the judge on the evidence before her  did
    the best that could be done in the circumstances of the case.

15.  It does not seem to me that  this  is  a  case  where  the  absence  of
    representation for the Appellant has meant an inability to bring to the
    attention of the Tribunal the problems that the Appellant feared  could
    arise.  His ability to  articulate  and  give  consideration  is  to  a
    degree, but I do not hold it against him as such, demonstrated  by  his
    carefully cast reasons for appealing which were dated 9 September 2015.
     I find those setting out his concerns generally  show  an  ability  to
    explain and present what he wished to say about his health concerns.  I
    can only interfere with the decision if there is a  material  error  of
    law.

16.  Whether I would have reached the same  decision  is  wholly  irrelevant
    and it is not for me to interfere with a decision unless  it  does  not
    meet the relevant legal criteria for that to be done.  I  have  reached
    the conclusion in the light of the decision of the judge that this is a
    most unfortunate case but one in which the decision of the  judge  does
    not disclose an arguable error of law.

Decision

17.  The appeal is dismissed.

Anonymity

It seems to me that an anonymity order is not necessary or appropriate.
