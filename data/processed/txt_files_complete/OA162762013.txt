Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr D Hayes, Solicitor of Turpin & Miller LLP


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appellant's appeal  against  a  decision  of  a  First-tier
    Judge on 28 July 2014 allowing the appeal of  Mr  Hussain  against  the
    Entry Clearance Officer's decision of 22 July 2013  refusing  to  grant
    entry clearance.

2.   I turn to the decision that was made by the  Entry  Clearance  Officer.
    The essential  issue  of  concern  was  that  of  the  genuineness  and
    subsistence of the relationship that Mr Hussain, whom I will  hereafter
    refer to as the appellant as he was before  the  judge,  has  with  his
    wife,  the  sponsor,  and  whether  they  intended  to  live   together
    permanently in the United Kingdom.

3.   I need say nothing more about that I think because  the  judge  allowed
    the appeal in relation to that  and  there  is  no  challenge  to  that
    decision on behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer.  But the  respondent
    went on to say as follows:

         "In refusing the application no determination has been  made as  to
         whether the applicant meets the minimum of income and accommodation
         requirements under Appendices FM and FM-SE of the  Rules.   However
         we have assessed that regardless of whether the minimum income  and
         accommodation requirements are  met.   The  application  falls  for
         refusal under the Rules."

    As regards how that issue was  addressed  at  the  hearing,  the  judge
    allowed the appeal in relation to subsistence and  intention  and  that
    was an end of that matter.

4.   Paragraph 22 of the determination  is  concerned  with  this  remaining
    issue.  The judge noted that the Entry Clearance Officer had chosen not
    to examine the financial documents presented  and went on to say

         "The detailed financial documents were placed  before  me  and  the
         Presenting Officer said she was not in a position to  assess  those
         documents.  They therefore remain  unchallenged.  They  are  to  be
         viewed in the light of the open and truthful evidence given to  me.
         I  accept  those  documents  and  they  show  that  the   financial
         requirements of Appendix FM  are met."

5.   That is the essence of it  for  these  purposes  and  the  grounds  are
    commendably brief: that the judge erred in law in failing  to  consider
    adequately the financial requirements set out in the relevant  Rule  as
    regards  maintenance  and  also  in  relation  to   accommodation   and
    permission was granted on the basis that it was arguably necessary  for
    the judge  to  say  more  than  that  the  documents  showed  that  the
    requirement was met.

6.   Then we have a Rule 24 response which summarises the evidence that  was
    set out in the skeleton argument  that  was  placed  before  the  judge
    regarding  earnings  and   also   notes   the   position   as   regards
    accommodation.  I think on accommodation it may be necessary to go back
    to the determination briefly.  The evidence of the sponsor was, and she
    was found to be credible, that they would  live  in  the  family  house
    here, her mother would decide who slept where. There are four  bedrooms
    and she lives with her mother and father and there was  no  mention  of
    anybody else living in the house. As I say again, it is a  matter  that
    was not specifically addressed in the decision letter.

7.   The first issue is whether there was indeed a point  before  the  judge
    as to support and accommodation in  light  of  what  was  said  in  the
    decision letter.  Mr Nath is of course right to say on the authority of
    Kwok On Tong that all the issues remain live before a judge but it does
    put the judge in some  difficulty,  I  think,  if  there  is  an  overt
    reference to no decision having been made as to whether  the  applicant
    meets the minimum income requirements under the relevant appendices  of
    the Rules and where it does not appear that the Kwok On Tong point  was
    made by the Presenting Officer at the hearing,  the officer simply said
    she was not in a position to assess the documents and did  not  examine
    those documents.

8.   My view on this is that the judge would have been entitled in  fact  to
    say no more or indeed potentially less than he did on the point.  There
    was  no adverse decision in relation  to  this.   The  matter  was  not
    raised by the Presenting Officer and the  only  live  issue,  I  think,
    which can properly be said to have been before the judge  was  that  of
    the subsistence of the marriage and the  couple's  intentions  and  the
    judge found in their favour on that and his decision was not challenged
    in relation to that.

9.   If I am wrong in that regard then I think that the judge  was  entitled
    to say no more than was actually set out in paragraph  22.    Mr  Hayes
    has helpfully included extracts from relevant authorities on  the  duty
    to give reasons and the obligation to explain in clear and brief  terms
    the reasons.   The judge accepted the documents, found the evidence  to
    be credible and concluded that the financial requirements  of  Appendix
    FM  were met.  That, I think, was adequate so as an alternative finding
    I think the judge's determination cannot  be impugned on that basis.

10.  If I am wrong in that regard then one turns to  the  calculations  that
    were put forward to the judge to show  that  the  sponsor  earned  over
    ï¿½18,600 a year and I looked at those before the hearing.  They do  show
    income in the relevant period before the decision which could  properly
    lead the judge to conclude that the minimum  earnings  requirement  was
    met and therefore on that alternative basis the appeal,  if  the  judge
    had come to address it, would also fall to have succeeded.

11.  As regards accommodation, the intention was that  they  would  live  in
    the family home.  It is not a matter on which issue was taken  earlier,
    as I say, and I  think the  evidence,  bearing  in  mind  the  positive
    credibility findings, was such that it was entirely open to  the  judge
    to accept that the requirements of the Rules on accommodation were  met
    also.  Accordingly his decision allowing the appeal on all  grounds  is
    maintained.

12.  So for all these reasons  I  consider  that  the  appeal  was  properly
    allowed by the judge and the decision allowing the appeal is  therefore
    maintained.

Supplementary Issue

13.  Mr Hayes has  also  applied  for  a  wasted  costs  order  against  the
    respondent, arguing, in essence,  that  it  was  unreasonable  to  seek
    permission to appeal having failed to take a  point  on  the  financial
    requirements issue. He provided case law (Ridehalgh  v  Horsefield  and
    Isherwood [1994] EWCA Civ 40 and Odundu and Abdussalam  v  SSHD  [2014]
    UKUT  377 (IAC) on the ambit of the wasted costs jurisdiction.

14.  Mr Nath was given seven days in which to respond.  In his  response  he
    argues that the Tribunal has no power  to  award  costs  on  the  basis
    suggested by Mr Hayes. To address this  argument  it  is  necessary  to
    consider the relevant statutory and other materials.

15.  The Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 section  29,  states  as
follows:

         "29.     Costs or expensesE+W+S+N.I.


         This sectionnoteType=Explanatory Notes has no associated
             (1)  The costs of and incidental to-

                  (a)  all proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal, and

                  (b)  all proceedings in the Upper Tribunal,  shall  be  in
                      the  discretion  of  the  Tribunal   in   which   the
                      proceedings take place.

             (2)  The relevant Tribunal shall have full power to  determine
                  by whom and to what extent the costs are to be paid.

             (3)  Subsections (1) and (2) have effect subject  to  Tribunal
                  Procedure Rules.

             (4)  In any  proceedings  mentioned  in  subsection  (1),  the
                  relevant Tribunal may-

                  (a)  disallow, or

                  (b)  (as the  case  may  be)  order  the  legal  or  other
                      representative concerned to meet, the  whole  of  any
                      wasted  costs  or  such  part  of  them  as  may   be
                      determined  in  accordance  with  Tribunal  Procedure
                      Rules.

         (5)  In subsection (4) 'wasted costs' means any costs incurred by a
             party-

             (a)  as a result of any improper,  unreasonable  or  negligent
                  act or  omission  on  the  part  of  any  legal  or  other
                  representative or any employee of such  a  representative,
                  or

             (b)  which, in the light of any such act or omission occurring
                  after they were incurred, the relevant Tribunal  considers
                  it is unreasonable to expect that party to pay."

16.  The relevant provisions of  The  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 state as follows:

         "Order for costs

         10(1)  The Upper Tribunal may not make an order in respect of costs
             (or, in Scotland,  expenses)  in  proceedings  transferred  or
             referred by, or on appeal  from , another tribunal except -

              (aa) in a national security certificate appeal, to the  extent
             permitted by paragraph (1(A);

              (a) in proceedings [transferred by, or on  appeal  from],  the
             Tax Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal; or

              (b) to the extent and in  the  circumstances  that  the  other
             tribunal had the power to make an order in  respect  of  costs
             (or, in Scotland, expenses).

         (1A)  In  a  national  security  certificate  appeal  -   (..   not
             applicable)

         (2)  (Not applicable)

         (3)  In other proceedings, the Upper Tribunal may not make an order
             in respect or costs of expenses except-

              (a) in judicial review proceedings'

              (b)      ...

             (c)  section 29(4) of the 2007 Act (wasted  costs)  and  costs
                  incurred in applying for such costs;

             (d)  if the Upper Tribunal  considers  that  a  party  or  its
                  representative  has  acted   unreasonably   in   bringing,
                  defending or conducting the proceedings;

             (e) ... not applicable"

17.   The  relevant  provisions  of  The  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal
    (Procedure) Rules 2005 state as follows

         "23A

         (1)  Except as provided for in paragraph (2), the Tribunal may  not
             make any order in respect of costs (or in Scotland,  expenses)
             pursuant  to  section  29  of  the   Tribunals,   Courts   and
             Enforcement Act 2007 (power to award costs).

         (2)  If the Tribunal allows an appeal, it may order the  respondent
             to pay the appellant an amount no greater than -

              (a)      any fee paid under the Fees Order that has  not  been
             refunded; and

             (b)  any fee which the appellant is or may be  liable  to  pay
                  under that Order."

18.  If the matter is governed solely by s.29(3) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts
    and Enforcement Act, then subject to one point,  considered  below,  Mr
    Nath is correct, since Rule 10(1)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules limits the Upper Tribunal's power to maker an order  in
    respect of costs to the extent and in the circumstances that the First-
    tier Tribunal had the power to make such an order, and in  the  instant
    case the  judge made a full fee award which is all he can do under Rule
    23A.  But this argument depends on an interpretation of s.29  that,  in
    effect, limits the ambit of an award of costs  in  either  Tribunal  to
    what is provided in the respective Procedure Rules.   However,  s.29(4)
    which makes provision for wasted costs orders, is arguably  not  to  be
    read down in light of s.29(3)  following  on,  as  it  does,  from  the
    qualification in  s.29(3).

19.  There is specific provision in Rule 10(3)(c) for a wasted  costs  order
    in the Upper  Tribunal   "in  other  proceedings"  (Rule  10(3)).   The
    meaning of "other provisions" is unclear. It is clearly not a reference
    to judicial review proceedings, since they are specifically referred to
    in Rule 10(3)(a). The only other proceedings with  which  UT  (IAC)  is
    concerned are statutory appeals and the power of the Upper Tribunal  to
    make an order in respect of costs in an appeal  from  another  Tribunal
    is, as set out above, limited in the terms of Rule 10(1)(b).  But  even
    if there is on the face of it no scope within  Rule  10  for  a  wasted
    costs order by  UT(IAC)in a statutory appeal, the point concerning  the
    ambit of s.29(4) remains and it is relevant to  note  paragraph  11  of
    Odundu and Abdussalam v SSHD [2014] UKUT  377  (IAC)  where  the  Upper
    Tribunal considered  it to be clear from s. 29 and  Rule  10  that  the
    power to make wasted costs orders applies to all proceedings whether in
    the context of judicial review or otherwise.

20.  I conclude that the power to make a wasted costs order  exists  in  the
    Upper Tribunal but I do not consider, on the  basis  of  the  terms  of
    s.29(5)(a) that the acts or omissions of the Secretary of State in this
    case  can  properly  be  characterized  as  improper,  unreasonable  or
    negligent.  I note the points made at paragraphs 20-25 of the response,
    but, though I  do  not  think  the  respondent's  conduct  is  free  of
    criticism, none of the necessary criteria are,  in  my  judgment,  made
    out. I therefore decline to make a wasted costs order.
