Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Mohzad (counsel) instructed by Burton & Burton
                    solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    To preserve the anonymity order deemed  necessary  by  the  First-tier
Tribunal, I make an anonymity order under Rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008,  precluding  publication  of  any  information
regarding the proceedings which would be  likely  to  lead  members  of  the
public to identify the appellant.

2.    This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge R R Hopkins promulgated on 18/05/2018,  which  dismissed  the
Appellant's appeal

Background

3.    The Appellant was born on 03/06/1984 and  is  a  Kurdish  national  of
Iraq.  On  22/03/2018  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the   Appellant's
protection claim.

The Judge's Decision

4.     The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   First-tier
Tribunal Judge R R Hopkins ("the Judge") dismissed the  appeal  against  the
Respondent's decision.

5.    Grounds of appeal were lodged and on 21/09/2018 Upper  Tribunal  Judge
Chalkley granted permission to appeal stating

    "I believe that the First-tier Tribunal Judge may have erred in failing
    to properly apply and follow AA (Article 15c))  Iraq  CG  [2015]  00544
    (IAC)."

The Hearing

6.    Both Mr Mohzad, for the appellant,  Mr  Walker,  for  the  respondent,
joined in asking me to find that there is a material error of  law  in  this
decision because the Judge does not  follow  country  guidance  caselaw.  Of
consent, I was asked to set the decision aside and to remit the case to  the
First-tier Tribunal to be determined of new.

Analysis

7.    The appellant is an Iraqi Kurd  from  Kirkuk.  In  her  decision,  the
Judge took guidance from BA (returns to Baghdad) Iraq CG [2017]  UKUT  00018
(IAC) and AA (Iraq) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 944. The Judge did not  correctly
follow the guidance given in AA (Iraq) [2017]. The Judge does  not  properly
explain how she reaches the conclusion that the  appellant's  home  area  is
not in an area of internal armed conflict (AA (Iraq) says it is). The  Judge
does not fully consider how an Iraqi Kurd will make his way from Baghdad  to
IKR.

8.    In AAH (Iraqi Kurds - internal relocation) Iraq  CG  [2018]  UKUT  212
there was general agreement that for Arab Iraqis there was in general  terms
no reasonable internal relocation to the IKR.  All returns to Iraq were  via
Baghdad but for a returnee of  Kurdish  origin  in  possession  of  a  valid
passport or CSID the journey whether by  land  or  air  was  affordable  and
practical and can be made without real risk neither are there  unduly  harsh
difficulties on the journey.  Without a passport or CSID a flight could  not
be boarded; as there are checkpoints if the journey is made  by  road  there
is a real risk of the returnee being detained at a checkpoint if  he  cannot
verify his identity.  The verification would normally require attendance  of
a male family member with the returnee's identity documents but  connections
higher up the chain of command could also be called upon.  It would  not  be
reasonable to require the returnee to travel  unless  he  could  verify  his
identity.  There is no sponsorship  requirement  for  Kurds  so  they  would
normally be permitted to enter  after  security  screening  and  registering
their presence with the mukhtar.  Whether a returnee was at risk during  the
screening process was fact sensitive but coming  from  a  family  associated
with ISIS, from ISIS territory and being a single male of fighting  age  may
increase the risk but the returnee is likely to be  able  to  show  that  he
arrived from the UK and  therefore  not  immediately  from  ISIS  territory.
Family members living in the IKR would in general be  required  by  cultural
norms to accommodate him  so  that  he  would  in  general  have  sufficient
assistance from the family not to render his life  unduly  harsh,  but  this
would have  to  be  determined  on  a  case  by  case  basis.   Without  the
assistance of family, accommodation options are limited - it  costs  $300  -
$400 to rent an  apartment  in  a  modern  block;  whilst  critical  shelter
arrangements are available (living in an unfinished structure, a  school,  a
mosque, a tent etc) it would be unduly harsh for a returnee  to  live  there
without basic necessities such  as  food,  clean  water  and  clothing.   To
consider whether basic necessities could be accessed, account must be  taken
of the fact the returnee  could  apply  for  a  grant  under  the  voluntary
returns scheme giving  access  to  ï¿½1500  -  financial  support  from  other
sources such as work, remittances from relatives  abroad  or  accessing  PDS
rations should be considered.  So far as securing employment  is  concerned,
lone women are unlikely to secure  employment,  the  unemployment  rate  for
IDPs is 70%, the returnee needs a CSID in order to work,  unskilled  workers
are at a disadvantage, patronage  and  nepotism  are  important  in  gaining
employment so that someone with contacts is in a better position,  being  in
a location with an association with ISIS can  deter  prospective  employers.


9.    AAH was heard in February 2018, but the decision was  not  promulgated
until 26 June 2018, more  than  a  month  after  the  Judge's  decision  was
promulgated.

10.   The Court of Appeal provided the following guidance in  AA  (Iraq)  CG
[2017] EWCA Civ 944.

    "A.     INDISCRIMINATE  VIOLENCE  IN  IRAQ:  ARTICLE   15(C)   OF   THE
         QUALIFICATION DIRECTIVE

         There is at present a state of internal armed conflict  in  certain
         parts of Iraq, involving government security  forces,  militias  of
         various kinds, and the Islamist group known as ISIL. The  intensity
         of  this  armed  conflict  in  the  so-called  "contested   areas",
         comprising the governorates of Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, (aka Ta'min),
         Ninewah and Salah Al-din, is such that, as a general matter,  there
         are substantial grounds for believing that  any  civilian  returned
         there, solely on account of his or her presence there, faces a real
         risk of being subjected to  indiscriminate  violence  amounting  to
         serious harm within the scope of Article 15(c) of the Qualification
         Directive."

11.   In making that finding the Court of Appeal adheres to  what  was  said
in AA (Iraq)  CG  [2015]  UKUT  0054  (IAC).  The  appellant  comes  from  a
contested area where there is an article 15c risk. The Judge does  not  make
sufficient findings of fact  to  enable  her  to  depart  from  the  country
guidance given in AA (Iraq) [2017].

12.   The following guidance is also found in AA (Iraq) [2017]

    "D.    INTERNAL RELOCATION WITHIN IRAQ (OTHER THAN THE IKR)

         14.      As a general matter, it will not be unreasonable or unduly
             harsh for a person  from  a  contested  area  to  relocate  to
             Baghdad City or (subject to paragraph  2  above)  the  Baghdad
             Belts.

         15.      In assessing whether it would be unreasonable/unduly harsh
             for P to relocate  to  Baghdad,  the  following  factors  are,
             however, likely to be relevant:

             (a) whether P has a CSID or will be able to  obtain  one  (see
                  Part C above);

             (b) whether P can speak Arabic  (those  who  cannot  are  less
                  likely to find employment);

             (c) whether P has family members or friends in Baghdad able to
                  accommodate him;

             (d)  whether  P  is  a  lone  female   (women   face   greater
                  difficulties than men in finding employment);

             (e) whether P can find a sponsor to access  a  hotel  room  or
                  rent accommodation;

             (f) whether P is from a minority community;

             (g) whether there is support available for P bearing  in  mind
                  there is some evidence that returned failed asylum seekers
                  are provided with the support generally given to IDPs.

         16.       There  is  not  a  real  risk  of  an  ordinary  civilian
             travelling from Baghdad airport to the southern  governorates,
             suffering serious harm en route to  such  governorates  so  as
             engage Article 15(c)."

13.   In AAH (Iraqi Kurds - internal relocation) Iraq  CG  [2018]  UKUT  212
section C of the guidance given in AA [2017] is supplemented  with  guidance
about the factors to consider when considering whether it  is  possible  for
the returnee to obtain a CSID or obtain it within a reasonable  time  frame.
Section E of the country guidance is replaced - the new guidance  explaining
that all returns are currently to Baghdad but a returnee of  Kurdish  origin
in possession of a valid CSID  or  passport  can  journey  by  land  or  air
practically and affordably without real risk and  without  relocation  being
unduly harsh.  Domestic flights to the IKR cannot be boarded without  either
a CSID or a valid passport but if the returnee has neither, there is a  real
risk of his being detained at a checkpoint if  he  travels  by  land  (other
ways  of  verifying  identity  at   checkpoints   such   as   calling   upon
"connections" were discussed).

14.   AAH did not, however, amend the country guidance  concerning  internal
armed conflict in Kirkuk. AA(Iraq) [2017] tells me that  there  is  internal
armed conflict in Kirkuk, which is the appellant's home area.

15.   The Judge's findings of fact start at [21]. At [32]  the  Judge  finds
that the appellant can live in areas of central government-controlled  Iraq,
and that the appellant can live in Kirkuk. The last sentence of [32]  is  at
odds with the guidance given  in  AA  (Iraq)  [2017].  The  Judge  does  not
explain why she departs from the guidance given in that case.

16.   The Judge's decision was promulgated after AA (Iraq) [2017] and R  (H)
v the Secretary of State for the home Department (application  of  AA  (Iraq
CG)) IJR [2017] UKUT 00119 (IAC), but before AAH  (Iraqi  Kurds  -  internal
relocation) Iraq CG [2018] UKUT 212.

17.   If the Judge had followed the country guidance in  AA  (Iraq)  [2017],
the facts as she found them to be should have led her to conclude  that  the
appellant cannot return to  his  home  area.  The  Judge  should  then  have
considered internal relocation. Insofar  as  the  Judge  considers  internal
relocation at [61] of the decision, her reasoning there is  inadequate.  The
Judge does not properly explain why she finds that  internal  relocation  to
IKR is a viable  alternative.  The  Judge  does  not  resolve  the  conflict
between the facts as she  found  them  to  be  and  the  guidance  given  at
paragraph 15 of the annexe to AA (Iraq) [2017]. The guidance  in  AA  (Iraq)
[2017], when applied to the facts as the Judge  found  them  to  be,  should
have drawn the Judge to the conclusion that only one of  the  considerations
in paragraph 15 of the annex to AA (Iraq) [2017] favour the appellant.

18.   At [33] the Judge finds that the IKR is virtually violence  free,  but
the Judge does not consider either how the appellant will find his way  from
Baghdad to IKR, or the circumstances the appellant would find himself in  if
he enters IKR. The Judge's decision gives no consideration  to  the  ability
of the appellant to enter IKR. AAH says that the place of birth  is  crucial
to recovering a CSID, and that the place of birth  defines  a  "home  area".
Case law says that Kirkuk is an area of internal armed conflict.

19.   In R and Others v SSHD  (2005)  EWCA  civ  982  the  Court  of  Appeal
endorsed Practice Direction 18.4 which states that any failure to  follow  a
clear, apparently applicable country guidance case or to show  why  it  does
not apply to the case in question is likely to be regarded as a  ground  for
review or appeal on a point of law.   The  Court  of  Appeal  said  that  it
represented a failure to take a material matter into account.

20.   The decision promulgated on 18 May  2018  is  tainted  by  a  material
error of law. I set it aside.

21.   In a direction dated and served on 23 April 2019 parties' agents  were
invited to make written submissions in relation  to  the  protection  claim.
Neither party chose to make any further  submissions.  There  is  sufficient
material available to enable me to substitute my own decision

Asylum

22.   The appellant is an Iraqi Kurd from Kirkuk. The  appellant  claims  to
have a well-founded fear of persecution as a member of a  particular  social
group because he says he was involved in a family  feud.  At  his  screening
interview, in answer to  question  4.2  when  the  appellant  was  asked  to
summarise his claim, he said that his village been attacked by ISIS  and  he
could not go back.

23.   The problem for the appellant is  that  the  very  foundation  of  his
account is riddled with  inconsistency.  The  appellant  participated  in  a
screening interview on 9 July 2015. In that interview he did not  mention  a
family feud.

24.    In  his  asylum  interview  the  appellant  makes  excuses  for   not
mentioning a family feud earlier, and  then  claims  that  the  family  feud
started 17 years ago when his father became involved in a fight in  which  a
man lost his life; one year later his father was killed in  revenge.  Having
tried to set out the basis for the claim,  at  question  97  of  the  asylum
interview the appellant says that he does not know the name of  anyone  from
the tribe he says he fears. That answer follows the answer  to  question  96
in which the appellant says that he has never met anyone from that tribe.

25.   Throughout the asylum interview the  appellant  displays  a  startling
lack of knowledge of the tribe he claims he fears and admits (in  answer  to
question 119) that he has never  been  targeted,  that  he  has  never  been
threatened, that he  has  never  been  attacked.  The  appellant  says  that
neither he nor his brother nor his mother has suffered at the hands  of  the
tribe he claims he fears.

26.   In answer to question 94 the appellant says that he does not know  the
name of the person who killed his father. Throughout  the  asylum  interview
the appellant says that he relies on what he was told by his mother.  It  is
the appellant's own account that he  lived  peacefully,  untroubled  by  the
tribe he  claims  are  an  agent  of  persecution,  for  17  years.  On  the
appellant's own account, he has never been threatened,  he  has  never  been
assaulted, and no efforts have been made to pursue a feud or to embroil  him
in an historic dispute.

27.   The appellant gives a weak account, the essence of which is  that  his
father lost his life in a violent attack 17 years ago  and  since  then  the
appellant has lived peacefully, able to go about his daily business  without
fear or inhibition. The standard  of  proof  is  low,  but  it  is  for  the
appellant to prove his case. The appellant fails to establish that there  is
a real risk that he faces attack from another tribe  because  of  a  dispute
nearly 2 decades ago. The appellant fails to establish that he has  a  well-
founded fear of persecution.

28.   The appellant's fear of ISIS is a generalised  statement  of  fear  of
the conditions in  his  home  town.  His  claim  to  fear  ISIS  relates  to
humanitarian protection and article 3 ECHR grounds of  appeal,  and  has  no
relevance to the refugee convention.

29.   Therefore I find that the appellant is not a refugee

Humanitarian Protection

30.   Although the appellant is not a refugee, I must  consider  whether  he
qualifies for humanitarian protection.

31.   It is beyond dispute that the appellant comes from Kirkuk.  AA  (Iraq)
[2017] says that there is internal armed conflict in Kirkuk.  The  appellant
cannot return to an area  where  there  is  an  article  15c  risk.  I  must
consider where else he can safely go in Iraq.

32.   AAH (Iraqi Kurds -  internal  relocation)  Iraq  CG  [2018]  UKUT  212
amended the guidance given in AA (Iraq) [2017]  insofar  as  it  relates  to
Iraqi Kurds (i.e. the guidance relating to this appellant)

    "Section E of  Country  Guidance  annexed  to  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    decision in AA (Iraq) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2017] Imm AR 1440; [2017] EWCA Civ 944 is replaced with the  following
    guidance:

      1. There are currently no international flights to the  Iraqi  Kurdish
         Region (IKR). All returns from the United Kingdom are to Baghdad.

      2. For an Iraqi national returnee (P) of Kurdish origin in  possession
         of a valid CSID or Iraqi passport, the journey from Baghdad to  the
         IKR, whether by air or land, is affordable and practical and can be
         made without a real risk of P suffering persecution, serious  harm,
         Article 3 ill treatment nor would any difficulties on  the  journey
         make relocation unduly harsh.

      3. P is unable to board a domestic flight between Baghdad and the  IKR
         without either a CSID or a valid passport.

      4. P will face considerable difficulty in making the  journey  between
         Baghdad and the IKR by land without a CSID or valid passport. There
         are numerous checkpoints en route, including two checkpoints in the
         immediate vicinity of the airport.  If P has neither a CSID  nor  a
         valid passport there is a real  risk  of  P  being  detained  at  a
         checkpoint until such time as the security personnel  are  able  to
         verify P's identity.  It is not reasonable to require P  to  travel
         between Baghdad and IKR by land absent the ability of P  to  verify
         his identity at a checkpoint. This normally requires the attendance
         of a male family member and production of  P's  identity  documents
         but may also be achieved by calling upon "connections" higher up in
         the chain of command.

      5. Once at the IKR border (land or air) P would  normally  be  granted
         entry  to  the  territory.  Subject  to  security  screening,   and
         registering presence with the local mukhtar, P would  be  permitted
         to enter and reside in the IKR with no further legal impediments or
         requirements. There is no sponsorship requirement for Kurds.

      6. Whether P would be at particular risk of ill-treatment  during  the
         security screening process  must  be  assessed  on  a  case-by-case
         basis. Additional factors  that  may  increase  risk  include:  (i)
         coming from a family with  a  known  association  with  ISIL,  (ii)
         coming from an area associated with ISIL and (iii) being  a  single
         male of fighting age. P is likely to be able to evidence  the  fact
         of recent arrival from the UK, which would dispel any suggestion of
         having arrived directly from ISIL territory.

      7. If P has family members living in  the  IKR  cultural  norms  would
         require that family to  accommodate  P.  In  such  circumstances  P
         would, in general, have sufficient assistance from the family so as
         to lead a 'relatively normal  life',  which  would  not  be  unduly
         harsh.  It  is  nevertheless  important  for   decision-makers   to
         determine the extent of any assistance likely to be provided by P's
         family on a case by case basis.

      8. For  those  without  the  assistance  of  family  in  the  IKR  the
         accommodation options are limited:

          i) Absent special circumstances it is not reasonably likely  that
             P will be able to gain access to one of the refugee  camps  in
             the IKR; these camps are already extremely overcrowded and are
             closed to newcomers. 64% of IDPs are accommodated  in  private
             settings with the vast majority living with family members;

         ii) If P cannot live with a family member, apartments in a  modern
             block in a new neighbourhood are available for rent at a  cost
             of between $300 and $400 per month;

        iii) P could resort to a 'critical shelter arrangement', living  in
             an unfinished or abandoned structure, makeshift shelter, tent,
             mosque, church or squatting  in  a  government  building.   It
             would be unduly harsh to require P to relocate to the IKR if P
             will live in a critical  housing  shelter  without  access  to
             basic necessities such as food, clean water and clothing;

         iv) In considering  whether  P  would  be  able  to  access  basic
             necessities, account must be taken of  the  fact  that  failed
             asylum seekers are entitled to apply for  a  grant  under  the
             Voluntary Returns Scheme, which could give P access to  ï¿½1500.
             Consideration should also be given to  whether  P  can  obtain
             financial support from other sources such as  (a)  employment,
             (b) remittances from relatives abroad, (c) the availability of
             ad hoc charity or by being able to access PDS rations.

      9. Whether P is able to secure employment must be assessed on a  case-
         by-case basis taking the following matters into account:

          i) Gender. Lone women are very unlikely  to  be  able  to  secure
             legitimate employment;

         ii) The unemployment rate for Iraqi IDPs living in the IKR is 70%;

        iii) P cannot work without a CSID;

         iv) Patronage and nepotism continue to  be  important  factors  in
             securing employment. A returnee with family connections to the
             region will have a significant  advantage  in  that  he  would
             ordinarily be  able  to  call  upon  those  contacts  to  make
             introductions to prospective employers and to vouch for him;

          v) Skills, education and experience. Unskilled workers are at the
             greatest disadvantage, with the decline  in  the  construction
             industry reducing the number of labouring jobs available;

         vi) If P is from an area with a marked association with ISIL, that
             may deter prospective employers."

33.   In KO (Iraq) v SSHD [2018] CSOH 71 the Court of  Session  reduced  the
SSHD's decision to refuse to treat further Article 8 submissions as a  fresh
Article 8 claim.  When considering paragraph 276ADE the SSHD had  failed  to
take into account the  relevant  CPIN  indicating  the  "dire"  humanitarian
situation in the KRG in circumstances where the petitioner was  unlikely  to
be able to obtain any employment as he was not fully medically fit  and  had
been  unemployed  for  years.   The  decision  letter  had  only  considered
positive features about reintegration but had made no  attempt  to  consider
the very real  obstacles  to  integration  which  existed  -  in  particular
personal problems for the petitioner in  a  situation  which  appeared  very
problematic even for an able-bodied adult with employment skills.

34.   The appellant's home area is Kirkuk. Case law says that Kirkuk  is  an
area of internal armed conflict.  Kirkuk is controlled by the Iraqi  central
government and is not within IKR.  The  Kirkuk  status  referendum  was  the
Kirkuk  part  of  a  planned  plebiscite  to  decide  whether  the  disputed
territories of Northern Iraq should  become  part  of  the  Iraqi  Kurdistan
region. The referendum was initially planned for 15 November 2007,  but  did
not take  place.   The  referendum  was  mandated  by  Article  140  of  the
Constitution of Iraq. Thousands of Kurds returned to  Kirkuk  following  the
2003 invasion of Iraq. The referendum  was  to  decide  whether  enough  had
returned for the area to be considered  Kurdish.   Kurdish  resentment  over
the government's failure to implement Article 140 was  one  of  the  reasons
for the 2017  Iraqi  Kurdistan  independence  referendum,  which  posed  the
question, "Do you  want  the  Kurdistan  Region  and  the  Kurdistani  areas
outside the Region to become an independent state?" The  referendum  led  to
episodes of Iraqi-Kurdish conflict and the government takeover of Kirkuk.

35.   AAH was promulgated after the Judge's decision.  That  case  does  not
amend the country guidance concerning internal armed conflict in Kirkuk.  AA
(Iraq) [2017] tells me that there is  internal  armed  conflict  in  Kirkuk,
which is the appellant's home area. The respondent argues that the  violence
there has diminished, but I am not  persuaded  that  I  should  depart  from
country guidance. The appellant cannot return to a contested area.

36.   AAH and the respondent's own country policy and  information  document
dated March 2017 indicate that IKR is struggling to cope with an  influx  of
refugees. The appellant is a young man of fighting age  who  comes  from  an
area which had been dominated by ISIS. The appellant does  not  have  skills
which would make him attractive to  an  employer,  and  has  no  connections
within IKR. The appellant does not have a CSID. AAH tells me that he  cannot
board a plane in Baghdad and that travel  overland  will  be  dangerous  and
unduly harsh. The appellant does not have the assistance of  family  in  IKR
so that his accommodation options are "limited".

37.   The background materials and caselaw tells me  that  the  unemployment
level amongst IDP's in IKR is 70%. There is no evidence placed before me  to
indicate  that  the  appellant  has  education,   skills,   experience   and
attributes which would place him within the top 30% who  obtain  employment.
It is therefore more than likely that appellant will face  unemployment.  As
an unemployed person who does not originate from IKR,  his  legal  right  to
remain within IKR will expire 20 days after arrival.

38.   It is most likely that the appellant will be returned to  life  as  an
unemployed, homeless, illegal resident. The  inevitable  illegality  of  his
residence reduces  the  already  slim  chance  of  finding  employment.  The
assisted voluntary return grant is nothing more than a short-term  solution.
When the money runs out, the appellant faces homelessness.

39.   Within three weeks of return it is  most  likely  that  the  appellant
will be an unemployed, homeless, man with no legal right to remain  in  IKR.
UNHCR say that the situation in IKR is a  serious  humanitarian  crisis.  It
must be unduly harsh to expect the appellant to relocate  from  an  area  of
internal armed conflict to a life of destitution as an illegal immigrant.

40.   Relying on the background materials and the country guidance  caselaw,
I find that the appellant is entitled  to  humanitarian  protection  because
there is no viable alternative option of internal relocation.

ECHR

41.   As I find that the appellant is entitled to  humanitarian  protection,
by analogy I find that return will breach his  article  3  ECHR  rights.  My
analysis of the facts tells  me  that  (as  the  appellant  is  entitled  to
Humanitarian protection and as return would breach  his  article  3  rights)
there  are  very  significant  obstacles  to  reintegration  in  Iraq.   The
appellant therefore meets the requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  of
the rules.

42.   I therefore find that  the  appellant  tis  entitled  to  Humanitarian
protection because  internal  flight  is  unduly  harsh.  I  find  that  the
appellant succeeds on article 3 and 8 (private life) ECHR grounds.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated  on  18  May  2018  is
tainted by material errors of law. I set it aside.

I substitute my own decision.

The appellant's asylum appeal is dismissed.

The appellant is entitled to Humanitarian Protection.

The appeal is allowed on article 3 & 8 ECHR grounds.
