                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-Tier
        Tribunal Judge Hanbury promulgated on 29th March 2018 in which  the
        Judge dismissed the appellant's  appeal  on  protection  and  human
        rights grounds.









Background


     2. The appellant, a citizen of  Cameroon  born  on  23  January  1989,
        entered the United Kingdom lawfully as a Tier 4 student on 20 April
        2014. Such leave was revoked as the college where the appellant was
        studying closed before he completed his course. On  27  April  2017
        the appellant claimed asylum  which  the  respondent  refused.  The
        appellant claims to face a real risk on return to the Cameroon as a
        gay man as homosexuality is prohibited in his country and  he  will
        be killed or subjected to cruel and inhumane treatment  there.  The
        appellant claims that Cameroon has an intolerant attitude  to  same
        sex relationships with wide societal prejudice  and  that  although
        gay  people  engage  in  homosexual  acts  this  has  resulted   in
        convictions and violent assaults [4]. The Judge, having  considered
        the evidence with the required degree of anxious scrutiny, sets out
        findings of fact from [21]. The questions the Judge  indicates  are
        those that are to be answered are set out in this paragraph.
     3. The Judge considered the documents the appellant produced which are
        described as 'being of such poor quality  they  could  easily  have
        been generated at home  and  did  not  add  anything  to  documents
        already produced to the respondent', which included a French arrest
        warrant  claiming  the  appellant  was  either  a   homosexual   or
        paedophile the first dated 19 August 2009 and the second 3 February
        2010. At [27] the Judge refers  to  the  fact  the  documents  have
        identical red stamps and despite being separated  by  a  number  of
        years the same magistrate appeared to have been involved in issuing
        several of them.  The Judge finds he would not be surprised if they
        were generated by the appellant. The Judge concludes that no weight
        can be attached to the documents for the reasons given.
     4. The Judge carefully considered the country information showing same
        sex  activities  are  illegal  in  Cameroon   and   punishable   by
        prosecution and conviction and acts of homosexuality in public  are
        not tolerated although many people  simply  exercise  their  sexual
        preferences in private and that those who do  so  publicly  may  be
        subject to violent assaults with reports of murders of  homosexuals
        [30].
     5. The Judge considered the appellant's mental health but found he had
        not been supplied with sufficient evidence to reach any conclusions
        on any medical condition or mental health issues.
     6. In relation to the first question set out by the Judge, whether the
        appellant's account is reasonably likely  to  be  true,  the  Judge
        finds  that  having  considered  all  the  available  material  the
        appellant  has  given  an  incredible  account  of  the  events  he
        describes, had not adequately explained why he claimed asylum late,
        supplied documents piecemeal  to  the  respondent,  and  failed  to
        produce any oral evidence from his witnesses to  back  up  his  own
        account [23]. In relation to the second  question  which,  assuming
        the appellant's claim is true, is whether he will  be  entitled  to
        international protection on one  basis  or  the  other,  the  Judge
        concludes that the appellant will be a discrete homosexual even  if
        he had that sexual inclination which fundamentally  undermines  his
        claim he will be persecuted in Cameroon or otherwise be subject  to
        inhuman and degrading  treatment  that  will  cross  the  necessary
        article 3 ECHR  threshold  [37].  The  Judge  considers  the  third
        question, the appellant's risk on return, on the basis he does  not
        qualify for international protection and finds the appellant failed
        to show he would be persecuted and concludes the appellant does not
        qualify under the immigration rules or any other provision of ECHR.
     7. Permission to appeal was refused by another judge of the First-Tier
        Tribunal but granted on a renewed application by the Upper Tribunal
        on the basis the grounds  are  said  to  raise  issues  as  to  the
        procedural fairness of the hearing which proceeded in  the  absence
        of the appellant's representatives.



Error of law


     8. The appellant alleges procedural irregularity sufficient to  amount
        to an arguable error of law as  he  was  unrepresented  during  the
        course of his asylum claim. The appellant claims  he  made  contact
        with a Mr Matthew Burns on the recommendation of a friend. Mr Burns
        requested �500 to prepare the appeal and represent the appellant at
        the hearing. The appellant states he paid the money and believed Mr
        Burns was now acting for him and although he  had  no  face-to-face
        contact with Mr Burns he was reassured repeatedly by  telephone  he
        will be in attendance on the day of the hearing. The Judge notes it
        then transpired that Mr Burns could not  attend  due  to  difficult
        family circumstances. The appellant claims he was not  prepared  to
        represent himself and had not prepared a  final  witness  statement
        and was not in a position to make submissions. The appellant claims
        he is a vulnerable  asylum  seeker  with  mental  health  problems.
        Following  the  appeal  the  appellant  sought  assistance  from  a
        community organisation and was referred to Duncan  Lewis;  although
        by this time the appeal had been dismissed.
     9. The Judge notes the following at [6 - 9]:

             "6.   The   appellant   was   unrepresented   throughout   the
                  proceedings   and    attended    the    hearing    without
                  representation. He claimed at the hearing that he  had  in
                  fact instructed a solicitor or  barrister  called  Matthew
                  Burns to represent him. He claimed that Mr Burns had taken
                  �500 off him for this but he did not know his firm's  name
                  or Chambers address. They had been in touch as early as 17
                  January 2018, but  he  had  received  a  phone  call  that
                  morning (at 9.41 hours) saying that Mr Burns daughter  had
                  attempted suicide therefore he was unable to come to court
                  to represent Mr Nzeme. I pointed  out  to  the  appellant,
                  having checked with my usher, that  no  contact  had  been
                  received from Mr Burns to the HMCTS and that the onus  was
                  on him secure representation at the hearing,  the  hearing
                  having been listed as long ago  as  20  February  2018.  I
                  indicated to the appellant that every assistance  will  be
                  given to allow him to present his case fully. I refused to
                  delay the case further for Mr Burns' attendance, if indeed
                  Mr Burns exists and is qualified and in funds to represent
                  the appellant. In fact,  Mr  Burns  neither  attended  nor
                  submitted any documentation during the morning. There  was
                  no formal application to adjourn but if one had been  made
                  I would have rejected it.


             7.   Following the hearing a fax was forwarded to me via email
                  on 9 March  2018  at  11.34  by  HM  Courts  and  Tribunal
                  Service. The fax contains a handwritten letter, purporting
                  to be written by  Mr  Burns,  on  un-headed  and  un-dated
                  notepaper. There is no indication of  Mr  Burns'  firm  or
                  other details. The letter suggests the  appeal  should  be
                  adjourned to permit Mr Burns to attend on a  future  date,
                  as his daughter had attempted suicide on the  day  of  the
                  hearing.


             8.   Mr Burns was not on the record as a person acting for the
                  appellant and to date I am not aware  of  any  application
                  being made by him to do so. I note that Mr Burns drafted a
                  letter for the appellant on 27 January 2018  but  did  not
                  indicate there that he had any legal qualifications.


             9.   Had the letter been brought to my attention prior  to  my
                  decision to proceed with the case,  I  would  not  in  any
                  event of adjourn the case, as no proper basis for doing so
                  has been shown. If the  appellant  wanted  to  seek  legal
                  representation he should have indicated  why  he  had  not
                  hitherto sought to instruct a lawyer and that there  is  a
                  reasonable prospect of him  securing  representation  with
                  funding in place."

    10. The Judge notes from [10] the procedure at the hearing in which the
        appellant gave evidence in English, produced additional  documents,
        and was asked a number of questions relevant to his case. The Judge
        notes the appellant was cross-examined.  The Judge  noted  at  [14]
        that the appellant handed further documents in during the course of
        cross-examination. It is clear that the  appellant  was  given  the
        opportunity and assistance to enable him to  present  his  case  in
        full.  As noted at [18], after cross-examination had been completed
        the Judge gave the appellant an opportunity to clarify  any  points
        he had been asked about, of which none was  forthcoming,  and  gave
        the appellant an opportunity to expand upon any points he wished to
        expand upon, for which he addressed the Judge.
    11. It was established prior to the hearing before the  Upper  Tribunal
        that Mr Burns does  exist,  is  a  former  Home  Office  Presenting
        Officer, who it is believed has been practising as a solicitor  for
        about 10  years.  There  is  no  evidence  to  challenge  Mr  Burns
        commitment to his clients generally  and  Mrs  Pettersen  confirmed
        that she was aware that he had appeared at the  Manchester  Hearing
        Centre from time to time. There appears nothing to suggest that the
        unfortunate family incident referred to by Mr Burns did  not  occur
        and no suggestion that the actions Mr Burns took in  light  of  the
        same was in any way unreasonable or unprofessional.
    12. Mr Ell submitted that even if there was no application to  adjourn,
        as noted  by  the  Judge,  the  Judge  should  of  his  own  motion
        considered whether the proceedings should have  been  adjourned.  I
        find no arguable merit in the claim  the  Judge  did  not  consider
        whether it  was  appropriate  to  adjourn  or  not.  The  appellant
        attended  and  advised  the  Judge  that  he  was   expecting   his
        representative but that his representative had  not  attended.  The
        Judge  noted  there  was  no  formal  application  to  adjourn  but
        considered it was  appropriate  on  the  facts  of  the  matter  to
        proceed, this must have included consideration  of  the  option  to
        proceed or not.
    13. There are  a  number  of  relevant  cases  including  AK  (Iran)  v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] EWCA Civ  941  in
        which the Court of Appeal said that where a claimant found  himself
        unexpectedly  without  legal  representation  at  a  second   stage
        reconsideration hearing, because the Appellant's representative had
        withdrawn the day before, and it  was  apparent  that  professional
        representation would be of benefit (not least because two  previous
        judges had taken opposite views  of  the  proper  outcome)  it  was
        incumbent on the judge to consider  whether  the  appeal  could  be
        justly  determined   without   a   fair   opportunity   to   obtain
        representation. The Appellant  was  entitled  to  the  opportunity,
        which the law allowed of a fair chance to secure representation for
        the hearing of an appeal which was of critical importance  to  him.
        In this case the appeal had been adjourned once  before  to  obtain
        representation which was found to be needed.  However, the Court of
        Appeal went on to say that the previous judges  immediate  estimate
        of the demands of fairness could not be  conclusive.   New  lawyers
        were later found; the case was complex;  research  had  established
        grounds for support for the Appellant's case as a result  of  which
        his case was  not  hopeless.   The  evidence  now  showed  that  an
        opportunity to find a lawyer might have made a difference and  thus
        the judge should have adjourned the case to give  the  appellant  a
        further chance to find a lawyer despite the fact that it  had  been
        adjourned once before.
    14.  In contrast, in R (on the application of Bosombanguwa)  2004  EWHC
        1656 (Admin) the IAA received a fax from the  claimant's  solicitor
        on the morning of the hearing stating  that  they  were  no  longer
        acting.  The claimant asserted that he had not been aware of  this.
        The Adjudicator proceeded to hear the appeal.   Before  Charles  J,
        the claimant argued that, had he been represented at  the  hearing,
        it would have been demonstrated to the Adjudicator that  there  was
        objective evidence to support his claim and, in  effect,  that  the
        appeal should have been adjourned by the Adjudicator.   Mr  Justice
        Charles said that it was for claimants to advance their case for an
        adjournment and there  was  no  general  duty  on  Adjudicators  to
        initiate an enquiry as to  whether  one  was  required.   (It  was,
        however, arguable, assuming that there had been an application  for
        an adjournment, that the Adjudicator had erred  by  not  explaining
        why she rejected the application and, in the circumstances, by  not
        making further enquiries as to whether the appellant had reasonably
        been expecting his solicitors to attend, as to what  material  they
        might have been bringing and as to whether the hearing should  have
        proceeded.  On that basis, the correct way in which to proceed  was
        for the Tribunal to ask whether the facts  now  relied  on  by  the
        claimant showed either that an appeal to the Tribunal would have  a
        real prospect of success on the merits if reheard or that there was
        some other compelling reason for the Tribunal to hear the appeal.)
    15. In AD (Fresh Evidence)  Algeria  (2004)  UKIAT  00155  (Ouseley)  a
        representative withdrew at the hearing when an Adjudicator  refused
        an adjournment.  The appellant then decided not to  give  evidence.
        The Tribunal held that it would be  wrong  for  an  Adjudicator  to
        grant an adjournment, which would not otherwise be merited,  simply
        because  of  the  withdrawal  or   threatened   withdrawal   by   a
        representative if an adjournment is  refused.   The  Tribunal  also
        held that it was not impractical, even with a late change of story,
        for a statement to be taken prior to the hearing on the day.
    16. In DMK, Petition for Judicial Review of a decision by the Secretary
        of State for the Home Department [2012] CSOH 25  the  IAS  withdrew
        representation 1 week before the hearing because of differences  in
        the Appellant's account. The  Claimant  asked  for  an  adjournment
        because he did not have a solicitor.  The Immigration Judge refused
        as he had had sufficient time to instruct legal representation  and
        his case could be justly determined as all of  his  witnesses  were
        present. The court held that this was not the case of a last-minute
        withdrawal  or  other  failure  by  a  prior  representative.   The
        Claimant had brought his witnesses and did not suggest  that  there
        was other evidence that he needed  time  to  gather.   It  was  not
        unusual for parties to represent  themselves  before  a  specialist
        tribunal.  The provision of appropriate assistance  to  parties  in
        such circumstances was a routine part of the  work  of  a  tribunal
        judge and formed part of their judicial training.  Parties did  not
        have any absolute right to be represented at fast  track  hearings.
        The Judge had exercised her discretion in a proper judicial  manner
        and her ultimate decision was one which was  open  to  her  in  the
        circumstances (para 46).
    17. In HH (Iran) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2008]
        EWCA Civ 504 the Immigration Judge refused to adjourn to enable the
        Appellant to find a representative even where  the  Asylum  Support
        and Resource Team had asked for more time to  review  the  file  to
        decide whether to represent him.  The Court of Appeal said that  it
        was  common  enough  for  Tribunals  to  deal  with   unrepresented
        claimants if there was no point of law to  be  decided.   Here  the
        simple question was whether the  Appellant  had  given  a  truthful
        account and the decision to refuse the application was  within  the
        discretion of the judge.   Article 6 of the ECHR was  not  engaged.
        It  was  impossible  to   say   that   legal   representation   was
        indispensable in this case.  The state was not compelled to provide
        the assistance of a lawyer for  every  dispute  involving  a  civil
        point in any event.
    18. The difficulty for the appellant in relation to  this  application,
        although it is accepted that the factual matrix is as  he  outlined
        and   that   he   found   himself   unexpectedly   without    legal
        representation, is that it has not been made out  that  this  is  a
        case in which it was apparent either  to  the  Judge  or  now  that
        professional  representation  would  be  of  benefit.  Mr  Ell  was
        specifically  asked  to  identify  why   it   was   apparent   that
        professional representation would be  of  benefit  but  other  than
        referring to the fact the appellant expected  his  advocate  to  be
        present, this was a protection appeal, and  that  a  representative
        could have assisted, nothing of appropriate  weight  sufficient  to
        justify a finding in the appellant's favour on this point was  made
        out.
    19. The Judge clearly considered the question  of  whether  the  appeal
        could be justly determined without a further opportunity to  obtain
        representation making it clear in the early part of  the  decision,
        as demonstrated by the Judge's conduct during the hearing, that the
        appellant was assisted at every opportunity to ensure that his case
        was properly put before the Judge.
    20. Mr Ell was also asked whether  his  client  had  given  a  truthful
        account of his case in his  evidence  before  the  Judge  which  he
        confirmed he had. Reference was made in submissions to the fact the
        appellant had produced a number of  documents  that  had  not  been
        previously disclosed, but the  decision  clearly  shows  the  Judge
        allowed  the  appellant  to  introduce  such  evidence,   with   no
        application being made by the respondent claiming prejudice if  the
        Judge did so.
    21. I find the Judge did all  that  could  reasonably  be  expected  to
        ensure that the appellant had a fair hearing at which he  was  able
        to advance his case and all the evidence he sought to rely upon  in
        both written and oral form. I find this is not a case in  which  it
        is made out that a professional representative would have  provided
        any greater opportunity for the appellant to  do  so.  I  accept  a
        professional representative would have been able to prepare witness
        statements and file appeal bundles but it has  not  been  made  out
        these would contain information the Judge was unable to  elicit  by
        other means.
    22. It was not made out by Mr Ell that  the  decision  to  dismiss  the
        appeal is not within the range of decisions reasonably open to  the
        Judge on the evidence. It is also not made out that  the  appellant
        would have sought to rely on evidence not  before  the  Judge  that
        would have made any difference to the outcome.
    23. Whilst the  appellant,  understandably,  was  concerned  about  the
        failure of his representative to attend  it  is  clear  he  engaged
        fully with the Judge in presenting his case.  I  do  not  find  the
        appellant has established procedural error sufficient to amount  to
        an arguable error of law material to the decision  to  dismiss  the
        appeal in the manner in which  the  Judge  dealt  with  either  the
        position that  arose  once  it  was  clear  Mr  Burns  was  not  in
        attendance and/or the manner  in  which  the  Judge  conducted  the
        hearing in ensuring the  appellant  had  a  fair  hearing  and  the
        opportunity to present his case. It is clear the  Judge  took  into
        account all relevant evidence, understood the  factual  matrix  and
        the appellant's concerns, and understood and applied relevant legal
        principles before coming to the decision under challenge.
    24. No arguable legal error material to the  decision  to  dismiss  the
        appeal is made out on any pleaded ground.


Decision

    25. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.

   Anonymity.


    26. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


I make no  such  order  pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
