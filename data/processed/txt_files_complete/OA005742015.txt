For the Respondent:     Mr S Staunton, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a Pakistani national born on 15  February  1996.  She
      challenges the determination of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  O'Hagan,
      promulgated on  3  January  2017,  dismissing  her  appeal  for  entry
      clearance to  join  her  father,  the  sponsor,  for  settlement.  The
      appellant sought entry with her mother and two younger siblings. Their
      appeals were allowed but the appeal of the appellant, who was 18  when
      the application for settlement was made in 2014,  was  dismissed.  The
      appeals were jointly heard in Birmingham on 4 November 2016.


   2. The appellant sought permission to appeal. Issue was  taken  with  the
      judge's  approach  to  proportionality,  it  being  argued   that   he
      misdirected   himself   when   requiring   the   appellant   to   show
      compelling/exceptional circumstances in order to succeed under article
      8. It was also argued that the public interest considerations were not
      considered and that these were capable of tipping the scales in favour
      of the appellant. Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge
      Martins on 10 August 2017.


         The Hearing


   3. At the hearing before me on 25 September  2017,  I  heard  submissions
      from the parties. There was no attendance by the sponsor.


   4. Mr Ahmed relied on the grounds which  he  said  he  had  prepared.  He
      argued that the judge had applied a narrow and restrictive approach to
      article 8 and had only considered whether exceptional or compassionate
      circumstances applied. He argued that the judge found there was family
      life between the appellant and the sponsor but  that  did  not  accord
      with his finding that the appellant was transitioning to independence.
      He submitted that the sponsor had been a student in  the  UK  and  was
      granted indefinite leave to remain  in  2013.  He  then  had  to  find
      employment and had to wait six months in order to be able to meet  the
      maintenance requirements for a  wife  and  three  children.  Mr  Ahmed
      submitted that it had always been his intention to call his family  to
      the UK when he obtained indefinite leave to remain. These were matters
      the judge had failed to consider.


   5. Mr Ahmed submitted that this was not a  'near  miss'  argument  but  a
      situation where the appellant had only just turned 18.  She  would  be
      the only member of the family left behind and although there would  be
      financial support, there would be nothing else.  The  cultural  issues
      had not been considered. Whilst it was not argued that she was at risk
      of persecution, her position as  a  lone  female  in  Pakistan  was  a
      relevant matter in the proportionality assessment. Whilst  the  public
      interest considerations were neutral matters  they  should  have  been
      taken into account and were not.  Whilst  they  were  referred  to  at
      paragraph 23, they did not factor in the  proportionality  assessment.
      In the circumstances of the appellant's case, the  inability  to  meet
      the requirements  of  the  rules  was  not  fatal  to  the  article  8
      application. The appellant has always been a member of the family.  It
      was therefore reasonable to assume that her separation from the family
      unit would impact upon the other members of the family.  Reliance  was
      placed on Dasgupta (error of law- proportionality - correct  approach)
      [2016] UKUT 00028. The decision should be set aside  and  remitted  to
      the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.


   6. In response, Mr Staunton relied on the Rule 24 response. He  submitted
      that the grounds were a disagreement with the decision. The judge  had
      considered all the evidence and the facts. The appeal was  limited  to
      article 8. The judge looked at the appellant's life  in  Pakistan  and
      the time spent with her family. He noted that the majority of her time
      was spent away from the family home whilst she lived at  her  college.
      She was rightly found to be transitioning to an independent life.  She
      could continue to contact her family in the same way as she  did  when
      at college. The grounds were a disagreement with  the  proportionality
      exercise. There was no error of law. If there was, it was not material
      but if it were found to be material, the matters should be kept in the
      Upper Tribunal as no further evidence was required and the  issue  was
      only a matter of how the law should be applied.


   7. Mr Ahmed had nothing further to add.


   8. At the conclusion of the hearing, I reserved my determination which  I
      now give.


         Findings and conclusions


   9. The facts are largely agreed. The sponsor came to the UK as a  student
      in August 2002 and was subsequently granted indefinite leave to remain
      on 30 April 2013. He is now a British citizen.  It  appears  from  the
      visa application form of the appellant that an earlier application  to
      join the sponsor was made but  that  this  was  refused  in  2005.  No
      details as to the  nature  of  the  application  or  the  refusal  are
      apparent. The appellant made the present application  along  with  her
      mother and her two siblings who were aged 17 and 13 at the date of the
      application in August 2014. She was 18 ï¿½ at the time. She is a student
      at medical college (studying to be a dentist) some 3-4  hours'  travel
      from the family home so she lives in a hostel away  from  home  during
      term time but returns for holidays. She is financially dependent  upon
      her father.


  10. It was conceded for the appellant at the hearing before the First-tier
      Tribunal that the requirements of the rules could not be met (at  17).
      The judge, therefore, proceeded to consider whether she qualified  for
      a grant of discretionary leave outside the rules. Applying  the  five-
      stage Razgar approach, he found that there was family life between the
      appellant, her mothers and siblings. He found the case was less  clear
      cut between the appellant and  her  father  as  he  lived  in  another
      country but  due  to  evidence  of  continued  contact  and  financial
      dependency he accepted that on balance  there  was  sufficient  family
      life to engage article 8 (at 21). He found that the decision to refuse
      entry clearance did interfered with the appellant's  family  life.  He
      found that the decision was in accordance with the law and that it was
      pursuant to a  legitimate  aim.  He  then  proceeded  to  undertake  a
      proportionality balancing exercise. He properly directed himself as to
      the law (at 18-20 and 24), noting that article  8  did  not  exist  to
      provide a remedy for every misfortune or vicissitude of life  and  was
      not an exercise in sympathy. He referred to  the  expectation  in  the
      judgement of Huang [2007] UKHL 11 that only a minority of cases  would
      succeed under article 8. He considered the policy intention behind the
      rules and had regard to the fact that article 8 was  not  a  means  of
      circumventing the rules nor to create a 'near-miss' loophole for those
      who fail to meet them by a small margin (at 27).


  11. The judge confirmed that he had considered all the circumstances,  had
      regard to all the matters and considered the cumulative impact of  all
      of them (at 25).  He  makes  the  following  findings:  (i)  that  the
      appellant had attained adulthood in February 2014  and  had  not  long
      been an adult at the date of the application; (ii)  that  the  sponsor
      had come to the UK, chosen to remain and accepted British  citizenship
      in the knowledge that the appellant (and the rest of the  family)  had
      not been granted entry clearance and  were  required  to  satisfy  the
      rules if they were to join him; (iii) that the family home was a  base
      where she spent holidays but that she lived away from home during term
      time; (iv) that her place of study was some  3-4  hours'  travel  time
      away from the family home; (v) that whilst the departure of her mother
      and brothers would not be easy for her, the fact  that  she  had  been
      living away from home would make the transition easier that  it  might
      otherwise be; (vi) that she would be able to maintain contact with her
      family by telephone or other means  as  she  presumably  already  did;
      (vii) that her family would be able to visit her and she  could  visit
      them; (viii) that the situation in respect of her father remained  the
      same since 2002 and (ix) that the appellant's  position  as  a  single
      woman would not be unduly difficult as she was educated, not estranged
      from her family and was supported by them. These are all findings that
      were open to him on the evidence.


  12. I have carefully considered Mr  Ahmed's  submissions  criticising  the
      judge's conclusions to see whether there was any error in approach  or
      whether any factors  were  disregarded.  Contrary  to  what  Mr  Ahmed
      submitted, the judge did  have  regard  to  the  appellant's  cultural
      background (at 29). It would seem to me, however, that the  appellant,
      in living away from home and studying to be a dentist, has shown  that
      she does not conform to the perceived cultural norms. Once  qualified,
      she would be in a  good  position  to  support  herself.  If  cultural
      practices are to be considered, then one  can  only  assume  that  her
      father would arrange for her to be married in the near future.


  13. The judge also had regard  to  the  impact  of  the  decision  on  the
      appellant and the sponsor and the children (at 19).  Whilst  Mr  Ahmed
      complained that this had not been  properly  considered,  no  specific
      evidence was put before the judge as to the adverse impact  separation
      from the family would have upon the appellant or vice versa. The judge
      acknowledged separation would not be easy and in the  absence  of  any
      evidence it is difficult to see how he could  have  gone  any  further
      than that. The  judge  was  aware  that  the  family  had  made  joint
      applications for entry clearance as this is referred to throughout the
      determination.  He  was  aware  that  the  appellant  was  financially
      dependent upon the sponsor and was still  studying  (at  21).  He  was
      aware that she was single (at 29). There are,  therefore,  no  factors
      which the judge overlooked.


  14. Whilst it is maintained that the sponsor has no relatives in  Pakistan
      who could look after the appellant, the  evidence  is  silent  on  the
      presence of his wife's family members. Certainly, there  is  no  claim
      that they are all outside Pakistan. Additionally, I  note  that  in  a
      Whatsapp message there is reference to an uncle.


  15. I do not accept that the judge misdirected himself as was  argued.  It
      is plain that he undertook a full and thorough balancing exercise.  As
      I have stated, all the factors Mr Ahmed referred to  were  considered.
      That is confirmed by the judge's findings (summarised above).


  16. Mr Ahmed placed reliance on Dasgupta; in particular  at  paragraph  26
      (not 25 as cited at  (c)  of  the  grounds).  In  that  judgment,  the
      Tribunal found that the fact that the public  interests  enshrined  in
      s.117B were not engaged, tipped the balance in favour of  the  factors
      on the appellant's side of the equation. I do not consider  that  this
      argument assists the appellant. The  facts  in  that  case  were  very
      different to those in the present case. The appellant was  an  elderly
      widower whose health was deteriorating and who had a close  bond  with
      his daughter and her young children. Here we have an appellant who  is
      a healthy and educated young woman at the start of her adult life.  Mr
      Ahmed argued that factors such as her fluency in English and hence her
      ability to integrate were not taken into account by the  judge  but  I
      have seen no evidence of her  language  proficiency;  indeed,  in  her
      application form she seeks exemption  from  that  requirement  on  the
      grounds that she is a dependant. Nor was there any evidence called  on
      her ability to integrate. In any event, these are neutral matters  and
      would not have led  to  a  different  outcome,  even  if  specifically
      considered.


  17. Mr Ahmed argued that the judge should also have  considered  that  the
      sponsor had to look for employment after he obtained indefinite  leave
      to remain and that he then had to wait six months in order to meet the
      requirements of the specified  documentary  evidence  for  maintenance
      before the family could make an  application.  However,  there  is  no
      evidence that this was an argument made to the judge and such a  claim
      is not made in the sponsor's witness statement. The  judge  cannot  be
      expected to take account of arguments which were not  made  and  which
      have only been put forward after the determination was promulgated.


  18. Mr Ahmed also took issue with the provision  of  the  rules  on  adult
      relatives and argued that it  was  ultra  vires.  The  judge  properly
      addressed this submission at paragraph 17 of the determination.


  19. Mr Ahmed argued in his grounds that the judge should have  had  regard
      to the fact that the appellant  had  no  possibility  of  meeting  the
      provisions of Appendix FM in relation to adult relatives. This, again,
      was not a factor argued before the judge.


  20.  The  judge  was  required  to  consider  whether  family  life  could
      reasonably be expected to be enjoyed outside the UK. Certainly, as far
      as family life between the sponsor and the  appellant  was  concerned,
      the refusal simply  maintained  the  status  quo.  Family  life  could
      continue as it had done by way of modern means  of  communication  and
      visits. No evidence was called as to the maintenance  of  family  life
      between the appellant and the rest of the family but it is plain  from
      the determination that the judge had in mind the need  to  assess  the
      impact of the decision on all family members.


  21. All too often, in this jurisdiction, judges are criticised for failing
      to make findings on or to consider matters on which no arguments  were
      made and on which no evidence was presented. Whilst  it  may  be  that
      another judge would have reached a different conclusion, that  is  not
      the test I must consider.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  judge  reached
      sustainable conclusions after a full balancing  exercise  of  all  the
      factors that were put to him and that there was no misdirection in his
      approach. It follows that I conclude that there were no errors of  law
      in his decision making.


             Decision


  22. The appeal is dismissed.


         Anonymity order


  23. I was not asked to make an anonymity order and I see no reason to do
      so.
