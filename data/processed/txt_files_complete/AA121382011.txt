Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Bedford, instructed by Sultan Lloyd Solictors
For the Respondent:    Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant is a national of Afghanistan and was born in 1994.

      2. Pursuant to Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
         Rules 2008 (SI 2008/269) I make  an  anonymity  order.  Unless  the
         Upper Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise,  no  report  of  these
         proceedings or any form of publication thereof  shall  directly  or
         indirectly identify the original appellant. This direction  applies
         to, amongst others, all parties. Any failure to  comply  with  this
         direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings. I do so
         in order to avoid a likelihood  of  serious  harm  arising  to  the
         appellant from the contents of his protection claim.

      3. This appeal is against the decision promulgated on 14 December 2011
         of First-tier Tribunal Judge Ritson which refused  the  appellant's
         asylum and human rights appeal.

      4. Following the decision of Judge Ritson, permission to appeal to the
         Upper Tribunal was granted regarding the  credibility  findings  of
         the First-tier Tribunal and the approach taken to the  respondent's
         failure to carry out her tracing duty under Regulation 6 (1) of the
         Asylum Seekers (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2005.

      5. In a decision promulgated on 20 June  2012  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal
         Judge Juss found  that  the  respondent  had  acted  unlawfully  in
         failing to carry out the tracing duty and allowed the appeal to the
         extent that the respondent carry out that duty.

      6. That decision was successfully appealed to  the  Court  of  Appeal.
         Remittal to the Upper Tribunal was ordered on 9 April 2014.  Deputy
         Upper Tribunal Judge Juss was found to have failed to consider  the
         ground of appeal relating to the credibility findings made  by  the
         First-tier Tribunal, in particular in relation  to  inconsistencies
         across his interviews, the approach taken  being  contrary  to  the
         principles in R (Dirshe) v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 421.

      7. The Court of Appeal order dated 9  April  2014  states  the  appeal
         should be "remitted to the Upper Tribunal of  the  Immigration  and
         Asylum  Chamber  for   reconsideration."   Mr   Bedford's   initial
         submission was that this meant  that  the  decision  of  First-tier
         Tribunal Ritson had been set aside by the Court of Appeal and  that
         the matter before me was an  entire  remaking  of  the  appellant's
         asylum and human rights claim.

      8. I did not agree. The Court of Appeal's view is set out in  full  in
         JA (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 450. At [36] and [37],  the
         Court of Appeal states:

             "[36] ... The Tribunal should, therefore, have considered  for
             itself ... whether the appellant had been  prejudiced  by  the
             failure of the Secretary of State  to  perform  her  [tracing]
             obligations under the regulations. However, if as  I  propose,
             the matter is remitted to the Upper Tribunal to enable  it  to
             consider the outstanding ground of appeal, its order  will  be
             set aside and it will have the opportunity to reconsider  that
             aspect of the matter as well.

             [37]. The failure of the tribunal to deal with the appellant's
             challenge to the use against him of the answers given  in  his
             initial and  asylum  interviews  goes  to  the  heart  of  its
             decision. Moreover, for the reasons I have  given,  I  do  not
             think that it was appropriate in this case for the tribunal to
             remit the matter to the Secretary of State, even if it had the
             power to do so. I would therefore allow the appeal, set  aside
             the  order  below  and  remit  the  matter  to   a   different
             constitution of the Upper Tribunal for  reconsideration  as  a
             whole in the light of the views expressed by this  court.  (my
             emphasis)"

      9. The matter appears to me to be entirely clear. The  Upper  Tribunal
         order of Judge Juss was set  aside  by  Court  of  Appeal  and  the
         grounds challenging the approach taken by First-tier Tribunal Judge
         Ritson to credibility and the tracing duty are to be  addressed  by
         me.

     10. Mr Mills submitted that the First-tier Tribunal erred in regard  to
         credibility and the tracing duty  but  that  the  errors  were  not
         material. He accepted that the initial interview which consisted of
         comments made by the appellant at a police station  just  after  he
         arrived in the UK when a minor with no  responsible  adult  and  no
         interpreter present was not something on  which  the  Tribunal  was
         entitled to place any weight given  the  manner  in  which  it  was
         conducted. He accepted also that  Judge  Ritson  failed  to  assess
         properly the weight to be afforded to the screening interview which
         was also conducted  when  the  appellant  was  a  minor  without  a
         responsible adult present and with an  interpreter  assisting  over
         the telephone.  It remained the respondent's  position  that  there
         were other adverse credibility findings at [6(d),(e),(f),(g)(h),(i)
         and (k)] which were sufficiently untainted that  they  could  stand
         and that no material error arose.

     11. I did not agree. The Court of Appeal in  JA  set  out  at  [1]  the
         circumstances in which  the  appellant's  initial  interview  of  7
         October 2008 was conducted. He had just arrived aged 14 ï¿½, went  to
         a UKBA office  late  at  night  and  "spoke  only  the  most  basic
         English". No responsible adult was present.  As  a  result  of  the
         circumstances of the initial interview of 7 October  2008  and  the
         statements the appellant made about his father being  so  different
         from his other accounts, the  court noted at [18] that "it seems at
         least  likely  that  the  note  [of  the  interview]   reflects   a
         misunderstanding."

     12. The Court of Appeal  set  out  at  [2]  the  circumstances  of  the
         screening  interview  conducted  on  5  November   2008.   He   was
         unaccompanied  and  the  interpretation  was  provided   over   the
         telephone.  The  interview  was  not  taped.  At  [19],  the  court
         commented that the appellant's evidence in the screening  interview
         about the whereabouts of his family:

             "... was understood by both the Secretary  of  State  and  the
             tribunal as a statement that both the appellant's parents were
             currently living in Afghanistan, but it was clearly nothing of
             the kind, particularly when read in the context of the rest of
             the interview."

     13. At  [23]  the  Court  of  Appeal  questioned  whether  the  initial
         interview  or  screening  interview  "should  properly  have   been
         admitted in evidence or,  if  admitted,  accorded  any  significant
         weight."

     14. The court concluded at [25] that had the Upper Tribunal  considered
         the challenge to the approach taken by the First-tier  Tribunal  to
         these interviews it could not be said that it would have  concluded
         that the challenge to the  credibility  findings  lacked  merit  or
         materiality.

     15. As indicated above, the respondent  concedes  that  the  First-tier
         Tribunal did err in its credibility assessment at [6(a), (b),  (c),
         (e) and (j)]. These findings relate to the core of the  appellant's
         claim. The Court of Appeal went further than merely  identifying  a
         failure to consider the weight to be placed on the comments in  the
         initial interview and screening interview given  the  circumstances
         of those interviews and questioned the failure to assess whether to
         admit those records  in  evidence  at  all.   In  my  view,  it  is
         unarguable that the reliance placed on the  initial  interview  and
         screening interview played a material part in the findings  reached
         by First-tier Tribunal such that  the  credibility  findings  as  a
         whole are tainted and cannot stand.

     16. For what it is worth I would also question  whether  a  failure  to
         pursue an asylum upgrade appeal by a 14 year old child is something
         upon which much weight can be placed (6(a)). Mr Mills also accepted
         that judicial notice could be taken of the use of "jan"  in  Afghan
         culture  between  family  members  and  friends   such   that   the
         appellant's credibility was not  undermined  by  stating  that  his
         father was  known  as  both  "Malik  jan"  and  "Abdul  Malik",  as
         suggested at 6(k).

     17. It was my view that the error in the credibility  findings  against
         the appellant amounted to an error on a point of law such that  the
         decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  to  be  set  aside  and
         findings on  his  protection  claim  re-made  de  novo.  Where  the
         findings of fact fall to be made afresh it is appropriate  here  to
         remit the appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  be  re-decided
         following paragraph  7.2  of  Part  3  of  the  Senior  President's
         Practice Statement dated 25 September 2012.

     18. The second challenge to the decision of Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge
         Juss concerned his decision to remit the matter to  the  respondent
         for her to carry out her tracing  duty.  The  respondent  does  not
         contest that this was an erroneous approach and  accepts  that  she
         did  not  initially  comply  with  her  tracing  duty.   Mr   Mills
         maintained, however, that the failure to trace  had  not  left  the
         appellant unable to make out his  protection  claim  such  that  he
         needed effective relief now. This was so in particular  where  this
         appellant was not credible and could not  expect  to  benefit  from
         "corrective relief".  Mr Mills also maintained that the failure  to
         trace could not be said to  have  had  a  material  impact  on  the
         appellant's protection claim as the Red Cross had attempted to find
         his family but had been unable to do so.

     19. It is common ground that the First-tier Tribunal erred  in  failing
         to consider the respondent's non-compliance with her  tracing  duty
         when addressing the appellant's protection and human rights claims.
          In my view, the outcome of the appellant's claim to be entitled to
         "corrective relief" had  to  be  uncertain  where  his  credibility
         remains to be decided. The respondent's failure to comply with  her
         tracing duty must therefore be part of the assessment of the First-
         tier Tribunal remaking the appeal.

    Decision

     20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses  an  error  on  a
         point of law and is set aside to be remade.

     21. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be re-made  de
         novo.
