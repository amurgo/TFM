                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Miss M Canavan (Refugee Legal Centre) for the appellant
Miss C Hanrahan for the respondent

   This is an appeal from a decision of an  adjudicator  (Ms  PS  Wellesley-
   Cole), sitting at  on 28 May 2003, dismissing an asylum and human  rights
   appeal by a citizen of  the  DRC  [Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo].
   Permission to appeal was  given  on  the  basis  that  the  adjudicator's
   findings, or lack of them, on article 8 were open to challenge.

2. Chronology

   01.06.94 appellant arrives in this country
       94. claims asylum
       96. TC ? born to SC (British citizen) by appellant
       97. asylum first refused
   28.02.97 marries SC
   early '99      separates from SC
   06.05.99 first appeal hearing
   27.05.99 Home Office decision treated as withdrawn by adjudicator
        10.99     sent to prison for robbery
        05.01     released and interviewed on asylum claim
   summer   takes up with PL (citizen of Angola)
   26.10.01 representations on Human Rights Convention
   15.12.02 fresh refusal
   17.01.03 DL ? born to PL by appellant: PL later gets ILR
   28.05.03 second appeal hearing
   16.06.03 decision under appeal sent out
3. The adjudicator took account of the situation, so far as the  appellant's
   family life with his Angolan paramour PL was concerned, and there  is  no
   particular complaint about her finding that PL and their small  child  DL
   could perfectly well go and live with him in the DRC. However  her  elder
   child R does see his father here, so there  would  be  some  interference
   with family life there. What is more, though the appellant no longer  has
   any family life to be interrupted with  his  British  still-to-be-ex-wife
   SC, he not only sees the daughter (TC) he had with her, but gets  a  good
   report from SC (letter 16 April 2003) from the help he gives with TC.  So
   interruption of that relationship would be a  serious  interference  with
   family life.

4. The adjudicator did not give any particular weight to  these  points,  on
   the basis that the appellant has not been with PL very long  (though  she
   did note they had already  had  a  child  together);  and  there  was  no
   evidence of any financial support from him for either  of  his  children.
   They are perfectly valid points; but not the whole story. On  reflection,
   Miss Hanrahan did not feel able to argue that permanent  return  of  this
   appellant to the DRC would be a proportionate response to  the  needs  of
   immigration control; so the argument came down to whether it would now be
   reasonable to require the appellant to return to the DRC to apply  for  a
   visa to rejoin PL as his unmarried partner.

5. Some considerations put forward against that can at once be excluded.  No
   difficulties in the appellant getting DRC travel documents are  relevant,
   even if  those mentioned in Home Office bulletin 1/2003  apply  to  those
   returning voluntarily (at least to speed their reunion with  their  loved
   ones back here). That is because, as should have  been  obvious,  removal
   was not likely  to  happen  in  the  first  place  without  those  travel
   documents. Nor are any likely difficulties in getting a visa,  once  back
   in the DRC, of any particular relevance: see  per  Lord  Phillips  MR  in
   Amjad Mahmood [2002] Imm AR 229.

6. Others are slightly more ingenious.  Various  Home  Office  policies  are
   relied on, from the one which it is said would normally have ensured  the
   appellant got exceptional leave to remain as an unaccompanied minor, from
   the time when he made his claim till his 18th birthday (now  long  past),
   to the "10-year policy" which allows to remain those who have  been  here
   that long: he has not, and it only applies to those who  have  been  here
   legally throughout; others must wait for 14 years.  None  of  them  would
   have let this appellant stay, either at the date of the decision or  now.
   All they do is show that lengthy residence may mean that  removal  is  no
   longer considered essential to immigration  control,  which  is  a  basic
   enough point for us to accept  without  being  referred  to  Home  Office
   policies which do not apply in the individual case. Such policies  should
   not in our view be referred to, unless  the  individual's  own  situation
   actually brings him within them.

7. What this case is now really about is whether, after this  appellant  has
   spent 9ï¿½  years in this country, it would serve any useful public purpose
   to require him to go back home and get a visa to  return  to  the  family
   life he has built up here. We can see that, where there is  a  relatively
   short time in this country, with a correspondingly new relationship to be
   considered, not requiring such a return would be  allowing  the  claimant
   (see Mahmood) in effect to "jump the queue" by achieving a  result  which
   those who did things in an orderly way might have had to wait  some  time
   for.

8. We have to take our own view of the situation, for the reasons  given  at
   3-4 above. The time in our view has  long  past  where  any  question  of
   "queue-jumping" might apply in this case. This appellant, who has  served
   a sentence of imprisonment for robbery, is far from the most desirable of
   prospective residents of this country. As Miss Canavan reminded us,  that
   also applied to Boultif [v Switzerland (2001) EHRR 50] and Moustaquim  [v
   Belgium (1991) 13 EHRR 458]. Those rather unsavoury individuals, however,
   had much more long-standing connexions with their adoptive countries,  on
   which they succeeded in their applications to the European Court of Human
   Rights.

9. What the Swiss and Belgian authorities had done in  those  cases  was  to
   take a view that the subjects ought to  be  excluded,  because  of  their
   criminal convictions. That could have been done by  the  Home  Office  in
   this case: by the time they got round to drafting their refusal letter of
   15 February 2002, this appellant had already served his  sentence.  There
   is however no mention of it at all. (There is one paragraph  setting  out
   his claimed history in the DRC, then a long passage of standard  material
   about that country, then five lines claiming that "careful consideration"
   has been given to the effect of the Human Rights Convention, but  without
   any reasons at all to show that was so.)

10. In our view the way the Home Office dealt  with  this  case  was  little
   better than a mockery of the public interest. If they had taken  a  point
   on the conviction  properly  (and  attached  the  relevant  material,  in
   particular a transcript of the judge's sentencing remarks), then it might
   well have been open to the adjudicator, and to us,  to  uphold  it  as  a
   reasonable response (see Edore [2003] EWCA  Civ  716)  to  the  balancing
   exercize required by article 8.2 of the Human Rights Convention, whatever
   the appellant's family situation; but there is no sign of them conducting
   any such exercize at all. They ought  in  the  public  interest  to  have
   considered this case, including the effect of  the  appellant's  criminal
   conviction, while he was in prison between October 1999 and May 2001.

11. Taking our own view, as in this  case  we  must,  of  the  rest  of  the
   situation,  we  have  no  doubt  that  at  this   stage   it   would   be
   disproportionate to the legitimate purpose of immigration control now  to
   require this appellant to return to the DRC and get a visa to  come  back
   here. This is not to be taken as any kind of a green light for anyone  to
   remain who has spent any lesser time  here  than  the  ten  or  14  years
   referred to in the Home Office policies, if only they  have  some  extant
   family  life  in  this  country.  If  the  Home  Office   give   sensible
   consideration to future claims of this kind, they are likely to be upheld
   under Edore. If adjudicators have to take their own view  of  them,  then
   there should be no challenge to where they strike the balance, so long as
   they give reasonable weight to all the relevant factors.
