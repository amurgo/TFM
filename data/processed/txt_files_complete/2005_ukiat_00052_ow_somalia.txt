                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is a Home Office appeal in the case of a  citizen  of  Somalia  who
   said he came from the Dabarweyne sub-clan of the Benadiri.   His  appeal
   was allowed on both asylum and human rights grounds by  an  adjudicator,
   Ms  SV  Pitt,  sitting  at  Taylor  House  on   22   December   2003.The
   adjudicator's decision is challenged on three grounds.   The  first  two
   relate to what might be  described  as  the  adjudicator's  differential
   credibility  findings.   First  she  disbelieved  the  claimant  on  his
   individual history; but she believed, on the evidence of his  supporting
   witness, a Mr Aagane, that the claimant  was  indeed  a  member  of  the
   Dabarweyne.


2. That is  the  finding  on  which  the  third  ground  of  appeal  turns,
   suggesting as it does that the adjudicator was not entitled to find that
   the claimant faced "a differential impact", in terms  of  the  House  of
   Lords decision in Adan [1998] Imm  AR  338  without  more:  on  that,  a
   Tribunal decision, now reported,  in  full,  as  FJ  (Risk-return-Tunni)
   Somalia CG [2003] UKIAT 00147 is relied  on  to  the  effect  that  mere
   membership of a minority clan is not enough.

3. The decision in FJ 03-147 was sent out on 14 November 2003: it may  have
   been reported by the time the adjudicator heard the present case  on  22
   December; but there is nothing to show it was cited to her.  If  it  had
   been, then no doubt she would  have  dealt  with  it.  Adjudicators  are
   presumed to  know  about,  and  required  to  take  notice  of  "country
   guidance" cases, whether cited to them or not, so long as  they  are  in
   the public domain as such at the date of the hearing before them (see SE
   (Deportation - Malta - 2002 - General  Risk)  Eritrea  CG  [2004]  UKIAT
   00295); but that system was not yet in operation  at  the  date  of  the
   hearing; and FJ 03-147 could only be  retrospectively  designated  as  a
   "country guidance" case. In those circumstances we have  no  doubt  that
   Miss Dawes was right to concede that the third ground could not succeed.

4. It follows  that  the  appeal  turns  on  the  adjudicator's  favourable
   findings on the evidence of the supporting witness  Mr  Aagane.  As  the
   adjudicator pointed out at ï¿½ 12, Mr Aagane was able to say a  number  of
   things about the claimant, their relationship, (maternal  cousins),  and
   their clan; when they last saw each other in Somalia, where  they  lived
   in Mogadishu, how they met in the UK,  the  names  of  their  respective
   mothers and a number of siblings.    Mr Aagane was not however  able  to
   say whether or not the claimant was married; or whether or  not  he  had
   any children.

5. The adjudicator quite rightly found this "...  somewhat  unusual,  given
   that the appellant and witness had been in touch in the UK  for  several
   months and they can be expected to update each other on  such  matters".
   But she went on "However the witness gave significant detail as to other
   parts of the appellant's profile and I accept that  they  are  known  to
   each other as  claimed.   I  find  Mr  Aagane's  evidence  supports  the
   appellant's claim to be Dabarweyne".

6. The adjudicator, again rightly, considered at paragraph 14  whether  the
   unreliability, as she found it, of  the  claimant's  individual  history
   affected the credibility of his claim to be from a  minority  clan.   As
   she  noted,  he  gave  some  correct  responses,  and   some   incorrect
   information on relevant points.  However, she did accept that  claim  as
   being supported by the witness  Mr  Aagane.    We  have  looked  at  the
   adjudicator's record of proceedings, specifically both at the presenting
   officer's cross-examination and at her final submissions.    There  were
   no further points taken than the ones the  adjudicator  acknowledged  as
   going against Mr Aagane's credibility.

7. Miss Dawes before us had placed considerable reliance on the case of  AB
   (Somalia) [2003] UKIAT 00125.  This  contains  in  our  view  some  very
   useful guidance on cases of the present  kind,  which  all  adjudicators
   dealing with Somalis would be well advised to take note  of.     However
   it is not designated as a "country guidance" case; and it could not  be,
   and was not referred to this adjudicator, since it was issued on 3  June
   2004, nearly six months after her decision had come out.   It  was  also
   issued, it follows, some time before the Court of Appeal decision in  CA
   [2004] EWCA 1165 became available.  There is nothing  to  indicate  that
   the Tribunal in AB 03-125 meant the very country-specific guidance  they
   gave on the proper approach to credibility as amounting to rules of law,
   though it is clearly the most useful advice on the approach to be  taken
   on the facts of such cases.

8. In our view, so far as AB 03-125 or the considerations set out in it are
   concerned, Miss Dawes needs to  show,  in  accordance  with  established
   principle, that the factual points now relied on were either made to the
   adjudicator and not dealt  with,  or  so  obvious  that  any  reasonable
   adjudicator would have seen the need to  deal  with  them,  before  this
   adjudicator could be said to have made a mistake of law by not doing so.

9. As we have already seen, the two entirely reasonable credibility  points
   made  against  Mr  Aagane's  evidence  before   the   adjudicator   were
   acknowledged by her.   Although the claimant may be said  to  have  been
   rather fortunate in the favourable view the  adjudicator  took  on  this
   issue, she did not disregard the points put to her, which  were  clearly
   those considered relevant by the obviously competent presenting  officer
   before her. For the reasons we have given  we  do  not  think  that  not
   considering others involved any mistake of law, and it follows that  the
   Home Office appeal is dismissed.
