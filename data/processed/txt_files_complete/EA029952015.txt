Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr R de Mello (counsel)
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood (Home Office Specialist Appeals Team)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Navalpreet Singh, a citizen  of  India  born  1
       February 1984, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  of  5
       June 2017 dismissing his appeal, itself brought against  the  refusal
       of an EEA residence card as the spouse  of  an  EEA  national  of  13
       November 2015.


    2. The Appellant entered the UK as a student with leave  extended  until
       April 2015, which was curtailed to end on 30 May  2013.  In  November
       2013 he applied for a residence card on the basis of his marriage  to
       a Dutch national, Sakinatou Minoungou, which was refused in  February
       2014. That refusal was on the grounds that the Sponsor was thought to
       have married previously, according to information she had given in an
       application of August 2010, and that she had not shown  she  was  now
       free to marry again. He made a further application  on  22  May  2015
       leading to this appeal, again  based  on  his  relationship  with  Ms
       Minoungou.


    3. The present  application  was  refused  because  the  Respondent  had
       suspicions as to the genuineness  of  the  relationship  between  the
       Appellant and Ms Minoungou. Her Dutch identity card had been provided
       in support of an earlier application as a  spouse  by  another  third
       country national and her explanation for the circumstances leading to
       this was not considered adequate. Furthermore, the information  given
       in the Appellant's application form  was  not  considered  consistent
       with his marriage being genuine: no documents had  been  provided  to
       indicate that he had been in a relationship with her prior  to  their
       marriage, and the evidence of cohabitation so far  provided  did  not
       show that theirs was a genuine relationship.


    4. Before the First-tier Tribunal Ms Minoungou  denied  any  involvement
       with the earlier application. It had been made by a  friend,  Fatima,
       who had abused her friendship and  somehow  obtained  a  copy  of  Ms
       Minoungou's identity card (she had sometimes stayed at the  Sponsor's
       home, so might have had access  to  that  document),  and  used  that
       identity to enter into a marriage, that  marriage  then  founding  an
       application to be made as the spouse of an EEA national.  Indeed,  Ms
       Minoungou claimed to have been in  Ghana  at  the  time  of  Fatima's
       application, and had been informed of what had happened by  a  cousin
       living in the UK on the  telephone;  she  was  surprised  as  to  how
       documents supposedly showing her working in the UK  could  have  been
       provided in support of the bogus application.


    5. The First-tier Tribunal directed itself that the burden lay upon  the
       Appellant, following IS Serbia, albeit that an individual only needed
       to discharge that burden where  the  Home  Office  produced  evidence
       raising relevant suspicions. Having set out the evidence  before  it,
       the Tribunal  did  not  accept  the  explanation  for  the  Sponsor's
       innocence of the asserted past dishonesty:


      a) It was implausible that the police would not have taken her
         complaint seriously, and her evidence that they had laughed at her
         plight rather than register a crime was thus not accepted, bearing
         in mind that she had produced no written police report to evidence
         her attempts to press the matter with the authorities;
         furthermore, whilst at one point in her evidence she had claimed
         that she had not known who might have misused her identity when
         dealing with the police, on her own account it was clear that she
         had known that Fatima was likely to have responsible from the time
         she first became aware of the fraud;




      b) She did not report the abuse to the Home Office, and it was not
         accepted that a solicitor would have advised her to fail to do so:
         had they done so, it would be reasonable to expect that a
         complaint would have been made against them once the fallibility
         of that advice became apparent;



      c) There was an inconsistency in her evidence, given that she stated
         that she had been in Ghana when she received the call from her
         cousin, but also stated that she had travelled to Ghana to make
         her own investigations into the abuse of her identity;



      d) The Appellant's own evidence as to the abuse of Ms Minoungous's
         identity was unsatisfactory, because he claimed that he did not
         know whether she had contacted Fatima: this gap in his knowledge
         was of concern given he could reasonably have been expected to
         take this matter very seriously, given its impact on his own
         ability to obtain residence;



      e) As to the evidence of the Appellant and Sponsor regarding their
         own relationship, there was differing information given as to the
         date they had met, as to whether the Appellant attended the
         temple, and as to the precise family relationship between Ms
         Minoungou and Fatima; furthermore the Appellant had stated Ms
         Minoungou had no children, when in fact she did.



    6. In the light of those findings,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  concluded
       that "Respondent has demonstrated even  to  the  higher  end  of  the
       balance of probabilities standard that the Appellant's  marriage  ...
       is a marriage of convenience".


    7. Grounds of appeal argued that


      a) The burden of proof had been misstated;



      b) There was an error of fact made as to the evidence before the
         First-tier Tribunal: the Appellant had not stated that he did not
         attend the temple;



      c) There were various mistakes made in the record of the evidence as
         it appeared in the decision: for example, there was some confusion
         in the way evidence was recorded, leaving it unclear whether
         answers were given in re-examination rather than in response to a
         question from the judge; the decision failed to record the
         evidence that the Sponsor had lacked information to make any
         enquiries in Ghana sooner than she did, as the 2014 application
         had only been refused because she was said to have been still
         married to a person whose identity had not then been disclosed to
         her; furthermore she had stated that the police would not help her
         because she held the documents which she said had been misused;



      d) Relevant evidence had been overlooked: particularly the evidence
         regarding Ms Minoungou having married a Ghanaian national in 2010,
         and vis-�-vis whether their solicitor had failed to advise them of
         two marriage interviews.



    8. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on  12  December
       2017 on the basis that the misdirection as where the burden of  proof
       lay might have had an impact on the assessment of the evidence.


    9. Before me, Mr de Mello submitted that a great  volume  of  documents,
       including utility bills and tax documents, placed the parties to  the
       marriage at the same address.  Given  the  existence  of  a  marriage
       certificate attesting to the marital status of an  EEA  national,  as
       shown by Rosa, the burden of proof lay firmly upon the  Secretary  of
       State. The error as to burden was exacerbated by the lack of focus on
       the intention of the parties to marriage when it was contracted.  The
       strong adverse finding that the Sponsor  must  have  taken  money  in
       return for her dishonest support of a bogus application was one  open
       to a judge only on the basis of the very clearest evidence.


   10. Ms Isherwood acknowledged the burden of proof lay upon the  Secretary
       of State,  but argued that the structure  of  the  decision  and  the
       detailed reasons in fact showed a model application of  the  standard
       of proof overall, notwithstanding the  infelicity  of  the  direction
       early on in the material reasons. In so far as  the  grounds  alleged
       evidence other than recorded by the First-tier Tribunal was  properly
       before it, no full transcript was provided and so the full  scope  of
       the oral evidence could not be properly assessed: it was wrong to try
       and go beyond that recorded  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  absent  a
       fuller record. There was no duty on the Secretary of State to provide
       a copy of the Appellant's application given the  contents  had  never
       been denied. The Judge's approach was unremarkable given the detailed
       reasons they had provided, and it was telling that no  complaint  had
       been raised against the former representatives. The documents said to
       have been overlooked could not  have  swayed  a  reasonable  decision
       maker:  they  were  sometimes  repetitive  and   indeed   some   were
       untranslated.


   11. In his reply, Mr de Mello maintained that the  documents  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal, such as those relating  to  the  proxy  marriage
       which  the  earlier  application  had  attributed  to  her,  required
       individual treatment before her marriage was rejected as a sham.


Findings and reasons


   12. The essential issue in this appeal is whether the First-tier Tribunal
       was entitled to find that the Secretary of State had  discharged  the
       burden of proof upon her to establish that  the  relationship  relied
       upon was a marriage of convenience.

   13. Papajorgji [2012] UKUT 00038 (IAC) explains that at the outset of  an
       application, there is no burden on a claimant to demonstrate  that  a
       marriage to an EEA national is not  one  of  convenience:  there  was
       merely an evidential burden  on  the  claimant  to  address  evidence
       justifying reasonable suspicion that the marriage is entered into for
       the  predominant  purpose  of  securing  residence  rights.  At  [27]
       Papajorgji sets out that "there is no burden on the  claimant  in  an
       application for a family permit to establish that she was  not  party
       to a marriage of convenience unless the circumstances  known  to  the
       decision maker give reasonable ground for suspecting  that  this  was
       the case."


   14. In  Rosa [2016] EWCA Civ 14 the Court of Appeal examined the question
       of the  burden  of  proof  in  EEA  marriage  of  convenience  cases,
       upholding the reasoning in  Papajorgi and finding that


   a) The legal burden lies on the Secretary  of  State  to  prove  that  an
      otherwise valid marriage is a marriage of convenience  [24]  -  whilst
      the legal  burden  remains  on  the  national  authorities  throughout
      proceedings, the evidential burden may nevertheless shift [29];


   b) It is for the national court to verify  the  existence  of  any  abuse
      relied upon by the authorities of a Member State,  evidence  of  which
      must be adduced in accordance with rules of national law [26].

   15. Mr de Mello also reminded me of the decision of the Supreme Court  in
       Sadovska [2017] UKSC 54, though it is difficult to see that  it  adds
       anything to Rosa in this particular context.


   16. The Appellant's strongest point is the issue of burden of  proof.  It
       is clear that the First-tier Tribunal misdirected itself as to  where
       the burden lay at the outset of  its  decision.   It  relied  on  the
       reasoning of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in IS Serbia  [2008]
       UKAIT 00031 that it was for an appellant to prove that  his  marriage
       was  not  a  marriage  of  convenience.  That  decision  was  clearly
       disapproved in Rosa �29, its conclusion being treated  as  "seriously
       confused"; the ruling in Papajorgi was accepted as  a  more  accurate
       statement of the legal principles.


   17. However, I do not consider this was a material error  in  this  case.
       Firstly, notwithstanding the misguided reference to  IS  Serbia,  the
       Tribunal below was clearly aware both that there  was  an  evidential
       burden on the Secretary of State to raise the question of marriage of
       convenience, and also that the ultimate legal burden  was  upon  her:
       that is clear from the decision at  �27  and  �43.  In  the  numerous
       paragraphs lying between those two passages,  detailed  reasons  were
       given for finding that the explanations put forward by the  Appellant
       and Sponsor were inadequate to answer the case as  put  by  the  Home
       Office. In those circumstances, it is unsurprising  that  the  First-
       tier Tribunal found that the ultimate legal burden upon the Secretary
       of State had been discharged.


   18. Secondly, it seems to me that the detailed reasons given by the First-
       tier Tribunal are legally adequate, and that it is  quite  clear  the
       question of burden of proof was not determinative of  the  appeal  in
       any event. This was not a finely-balanced case where  the  judge  was
       left in doubt, such that the question on who  the  burden  ultimately
       lay might resolve the matter in  one  party's  favour.  The  Tribunal
       below forcefully and thoroughly rejected every aspect of the evidence
       relied upon by the Appellant and Sponsor.


   19. Mr de Mello's eloquent submissions did  not  dissuade  me  from  this
       conclusion. He argued that the misdirection on the  burden  of  proof
       took on greater force once it was  appreciated  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal gave excessive attention to the Sponsor's lack of  innocence
       regarding an attempt to mislead the Secretary of State into  granting
       a residence card to a person who was not a spouse.  Accordingly  this
       finding on involvement with historic deception had unduly impacted on
       the assessment of the true intention of the parties to the marriage.


   20. Of course, it must be  accepted  that  the  mere  fact  that  an  EEA
       national may acted dishonestly cannot lead to a conclusion  that  any
       subsequent relationship they claim to have formed can be rejected out
       of hand. But this is  not  what  happened  here.  There  are  several
       paragraphs of detailed reasoning which assess  the  evidence  of  the
       Appellant and Sponsor in the context of their  claimed  relationship.
       There is no  indication  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  unduly
       influenced, when assessing the present  relationship,  by  its  prior
       finding as to the EEA Sponsor's honesty.


   21. However, once the First-tier Tribunal had found  that  the  Sponsor's
       claim of innocence vis-�-vis the attempted  deception  was  not  made
       out, it was to my mind entitled to treat her further evidence with  a
       degree of caution, so long as it bore in mind that Secretary of State
       bore both the evidential and ultimate burden  of  proof.  As  already
       indicated, it was perfectly well aware of where the burden lay..


   22. The grounds assaulting  the  adequacy  of  the  findings  essentially
       proceed by setting out what is said to be a verbatim note of extracts
       of the proceedings below, though without providing a full  transcript
       which the Secretary of State might have  been  invited  to  agree  as
       accurate. They then proceed to criticise the First-tier Tribunal  for
       failing  to  adequately  summarise  the   oral   evidence.   However,
       tellingly, those submissions barely touch upon the  material  reasons
       that appear in the latter part of the decision appealed: they  mainly
       relate  to  the  recitation  of  evidence  before  it  comes  to  its
       conclusions.


   23. Finally, I do not consider that the  First-tier  Tribunal  overlooked
       any documents that could have had a material outcome to its  ultimate
       conclusions. It  is  unfortunate  that  it  does  not  refer  to  the
       Appellant's bundle of supporting evidence. But when one examines  the
       copy documents therein, they amount to no more than utility bills and
       similar documents that are said to place the Appellant and Sponsor at
       the same address, and photographs which are suggested as showing real
       family life between them. But it is very hard to see how material  of
       this nature could outweigh the  very  real  concerns  set  out  above
       arising from the history of the case as a whole and the  inadequacies
       of the explanations provided to the judge. It is  perfectly  possible
       for  people  to  cohabit  without  being  man  and  wife,   and   the
       corroborative value of  photographs  almost  wholly  depends  on  the
       broader context of the evidence. Plainly  scenes  ostensibly  showing
       mutual devotion or broader family life might very well be posed.


   24. Mr de Mello sought to vary the grounds of appeal to raise two further
       points. Firstly he submitted that there was no  evidence  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal to show that the Appellant had indeed  stated  in
       his application that his wife had children. However, this arose  from
       a representation made in the Appellant's own application that he  did
       not dispute as accurate at the hearing below.


   25. Secondly, it was said that the marriage certificate that was produced
       as part of the bogus application  in  which  the  Sponsor's  identity
       document had been misused should  have  been  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal for it to deliberate upon. However, I do not see  that  this
       could  have  seriously   borne   upon   the   First-tier   Tribunal's
       conclusions: its reasoning was quite independent of any  concerns  as
       to the circumstances in which that document might have been produced.




   26.  Furthermore,  both  these  points  were  made  without  any   notice
       whatsoever to the other side, and, involving as they did reference to
       documents  not  available  at  the  hearing,  would  have   seriously
       disadvantaged the Secretary of State  without  an  adjournment  being
       offered. No application for an adjournment was made: quite  properly,
       given that any further delay in the appeal's resolution would not  be
       merited. I accordingly refused permission for him to do so.


   27. I find that there is no error of law in the decision  of  the  First-
       tier Tribunal.


            Decision:

    The appeal is dismissed.
