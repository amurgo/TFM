Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mr. V. Makol, of Maalik & Co.
For the Respondent:          Mr. E. Tufan,  Senior  Home  Office  Presenting
                 Officer.


                                DETERMINATION


1.    The appellant is  a  national  of  India.  He  appeals  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal, with permission granted by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
      Heynes on 1 April 2014, against the  determination  of  Judge  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal A. J. M. Baldwin dismissing his appeal against the
      decision of the respondent of 4 June 2013 to refuse his application of
      18 January 2013 for variation of his leave as a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)
      Migrant under the Points-based System.

2.    The respondent refused the application  because  she  considered  that
      the documentary evidence submitted with the application did  not  meet
      the following requirements for "Attributes" under Appendix  A  of  the
      Statement of Changes in the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended) (the
      Immigration Rules). She therefore decided that the appellant  did  not
      score the  necessary  75  points  in  respect  of  "Attributes"  under
      Appendix A.

3.    The requirements of the Immigration Rules that are in  issue  in  this
      case are as follows:

            Para 245DD (b)
           Appendix A, Para 36, taken with:  Table 4, para (d) (iii) (3)
                                        Table 4, para (d) (iv)
            Appendix A, Para 41(c)
            Appendix A, Para 41-SD (a) (i) (10)
            Appendix A, Para 41-SD (c) (i)
            Appendix A, Para 41-SD (c) (iii) (1)

4.    Whilst the text of para 245DD and Appendix A are set  out  in  greater
      detail in the attached Annex (with those requirements in  issue  shown
      in bold and underlined text), we set out here the text of  only  those
      in issue:

|                                                |               |

          [***The opening words: "is working" are incorrectly quoted in  the
          decision letter dated 4 June 2013 as:  "are  engaged  in  business
          activity other than work necessary to administer  his  business,".
          We are satisfied that nothing turns on this in this case. ]


          Investment: notes


          41. An applicant will only be considered to have access  to  funds
          if:


          (a) ...


          (b) ...


          (c)  The  money  is  either  held  in  a  UK  regulated  financial
          institution or is transferable to the UK.


          41-SD. The specified documents in Table 4 and paragraph 41 are  as
          follows:


          (a)  The  specified  documents  to  show  evidence  of  the  money
          available to invest are one or more  of  the  following  specified
          documents:


          (i) A letter from each financial institution holding the funds, to
          confirm the amount of money available to  the  applicant  (or  the
          entrepreneurial team if applying under the provisions in paragraph
          52 of this Appendix). Each letter must:


          (1) ...
          (2) ...
          (3) ...
          (4) ...
          (5) ...
          (6) ...
          (7) ...
          (8) ...
          (9) ...
          (10) confirm the name  of  each  third  party  and  their  contact
          details, including  their  full  address  including  postal  code,
          landline phone number and any email address, and
          (11) ...


          (b) ...


          (c) If the applicant is applying under the provisions  in  (d)  in
          Table 4, he must provide:


          (i) his job title,


          (ii) ...


          (iii) one or more of the following specified documents:


          (1) Advertising or  marketing  material,  including  printouts  of
          online advertising, that has been published locally or nationally,
          showing the applicant's name (and the  name  of  the  business  if
          applicable) together with the business activity,
          (2) ...
          (3) ...
          ... "


5.    The respondent considered that the documentary evidence  submitted  by
      the appellant did  not  meet  these  requirements  for  the  following
      reasons:

      i.    The bank letter from State Bank of India did  not  confirm  that
           the funds were transferable and disposable in the United Kingdom
           (Appendix A, para 41(c)).

      ii.   In addition, the telephone numbers of  the  third  parties  were
           not  provided  in  the  bank  letter  (Appendix  A,   para   41-
           SD(a)(i)(10)).

      iii.  The appellant had failed to provide any  evidence  that  he  was
           registered as a director of a new or existing business (Appendix
           A, para 36 and table  4,  para  (d)(iii)(3)).  Although  he  had
           provided a certificate of incorporation for his company  (Wadhwa
           Business Limited) (WBL), he had failed  to  provide  a  "current
           appointment report" from Companies House.

      iv.   The appellant had provided  a  job  title  that  was  listed  in
           Appendix J  (Appendix  A,  para  36  and  table  4(a)(iv)).  The
           evidence he had submitted to demonstrate that he was  active  in
           that occupation as part of his business was advertising material
           and a service contract between WBL and Castle Food  Company  Co.
           London  Ltd  (CFCCLL).  The  Respondent  considered  that  these
           documents did not satisfy  the  relevant  requirements  for  the
           following reasons:

            a.   the contract between WBL  and  CFCCLL  was  not  acceptable
                 because the contract states that  the  appellant  would  be
                 providing IT  business  solutions  but  the  appellant  had
                 stated that  his  job  description  was  marketing  manager
                 (Appendix A, para 41-SD(c)(i)); and

            b.   the advertising material did not mention his name  and  did
                 not state what services his  business  would  be  providing
                 (Appendix A, para 41-SD(c)(iii)(1)).

6.    The respondent therefore refused the application  without  giving  the
      appellant an opportunity to submit further documents.

7.    The appellant does not dispute that the documents submitted  with  his
      application were indeed deficient and did  not  satisfy  the  relevant
      requirements for the reasons given  by  the  respondent.  Pursuant  to
      section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002,  he
      was precluded from relying upon any documents in his appeal  that  had
      not been submitted to the respondent. The appeal before the Judge  was
      argued on the basis that the decision was not in accordance  with  the
      law because the respondent had refused the application without  giving
      the appellant an opportunity to submit amended/further documents.

8.    Before us, it was argued that the respondent's obligation to give  the
      appellant such an opportunity arose under the following:

      (a)   the "Evidential Flexibility Policy" (hereafter the "Policy"); or


      (b)   para 245AA of the Immigration Rules.

9.     Judge  Baldwin  concluded  that  the  Policy  did  not  require   the
      respondent  to  give  the   appellant   an   opportunity   to   submit
      amended/further  documents  before  deciding   the   application.   He
      therefore refused to remit the case to the respondent for  the  Policy
      to be applied. He did not mention para 245AA.

10.   We will deal with the appellant's case in relation to the  Policy  and
para 245AA in turn.

      The Policy

11.   The terms of the Policy as it existed in June  2011  are  set  out  at
      Appendix B of the determination of the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Rodriguez
      (Flexibility  Policy)  [2013]  UKUT  00042.  At  Appendix  A  to   the
      determination, the Upper Tribunal set out the terms of a letter  dated
      19 May 2011 which it held also  represented  relevant  and  applicable
      policy. The Upper Tribunal's determination in Rodriguez  was  appealed
      to the Court of Appeal, along with other cases. The Court of  Appeal's
      judgment was delivered in Rodriguez & Others [2014] EWCA Civ 2  on  20
      January 2014, after the determination of Judge Baldwin in the  instant
      appeal. The Court of Appeal held (inter alia) that the  letter  of  19
      May 2011 did not represent policy and overturned the Upper  Tribunal's
      determination in that regard.  This aspect  of  the  judgment  of  the
      Court of Appeal does not concern us in this appeal, as Mr.  Makol  did
      not seek to rely upon the terms of the letter dated 19 May 2011.   The
      Court of Appeal also considered the application of the Policy of  June
      2011 at paras 89-93.

12.   However, Mr. Makol submitted  that  the  Court  of  Appeal's  judgment
      could not be applied in order to  decide  whether  Judge  Baldwin  had
      erred in law because the  judgment  post-dated  the  determination  of
      Judge Baldwin. We have some difficulty with  this  submission,  as  it
      would mean that, whilst the three applicants in the appeal before  the
      Court  of  Appeal  in  Rodriguez  were  unable  to   rely   upon   the
      determination of the Upper Tribunal in Rodriguez, this appellant  can.
      Furthermore, even if we concluded that Judge Baldwin had erred in  law
      in concluding that the appellant did not come within the terms of  the
      Policy, it does not follow (as Mr. Makol appeared to assume) that  the
      case should be remitted by us to the respondent for the Policy  to  be
      applied. If we decided to set aside Judge Baldwin's decision, we would
      be bound to re-make the decision on the  appeal,  at  which  point  we
      would be bound to apply the Court of Appeal's judgment  in  Rodriguez.
      Thus, it seems to us that  this  appellant  cannot  avoid  having  the
      judgment of the Court of Appeal in Rodriguez applied to him.

13.   In addition, Mr. Makol proceeded on the assumption not only  that  the
      Policy  continued  to  exist  as  at  the  date  of  the   appellant's
      application for leave but also that it existed in precisely  the  same
      form as it did in June 2011, i.e. in the form set out at Appendix B of
      the Upper Tribunal's determination in Rodriguez.

14.   We have difficulty with both of these assumptions. It  is  clear  from
      para 47 of the Court of Appeal's judgment in Rodriguez that the Policy
      was incorporated in the form of para 245AA of  the  Immigration  Rules
      from 6 September 2012, that para 245AA has itself been  amended  since
      it was first brought into force on  that  date  and  that  para  245AA
      itself has an accompanying  guidance  document,  version  5  of  which
      applied from 7 November 2013. Thus, given that the appellant made  his
      application on 18 January 2013, it cannot simply be assumed  that  the
      policy continued to exist at the date of his application or  that  (if
      it did)  its  terms  remained  the  same  as  that  which  applied  in
      Rodriguez.

15.   Our observations at paras 12 and 13 are sufficient to dispose  of  the
      appellant's case in relation to the Policy.

16.   However, even assuming that the Policy continued to exist in the  same
      form, the appellant could not avail himself  of  the  benefit  of  it.
      Before we give our reasons for saying so, we will set out the relevant
      parts of the June 2011 version of the Policy, which we take from paras
      48-49 of the Court of Appeal's judgment in Rodriguez:

      "48.  I turn then to the Evidential Flexibility policy extant in  June
           2011 and taken to be the version potentially relevant  to  these
           three cases (that is, as recorded in the PBS Process Instruction
           which is Appendix B to the Rodriguez determination).  It has  to
           be said that it is not in all respects very clearly drafted.  It
           is to be noted that it is not confined to Tier  4  applications.
           In its introductory remarks  the  process  instruction  explains
           that a flexible process was first introduced  in  2009  allowing
           caseworkers "to invite sponsors and applicants to correct  minor
           errors or omissions in applications".  The  instruction  enabled
           caseworkers "to query details or  request  further  information,
           such as a missing wage slip or bank statement from a  sequence".
           Following analysis and review, as it was said,  there  had  been
           "two significant changes" to the original Evidential Flexibility
           instruction.  These were identified as follows:

           "1. The time given to applicants to produce additional  evidence
           has been increased from three  working  days  to  seven  working
           days;  and

           2.  There is now no limit on the amount of information that  can
           be  requested  from  the  applicant.   However,   requests   for
           information should not be speculative, we must  have  sufficient
           reason to believe that any evidence requested exists."

      49.    The  process  instruction  thereafter  sets  out  the   various
           procedural step sequences with the recommended actions.  I  need
           not repeat them all here.  They are prefaced by the words (which
           appear in the corresponding place in the  2009  version  of  the
           process instruction) "this procedure describes the steps to take
           when an application has missing evidence or  there  is  a  minor
           error".  It is to be noted, among other things, that in  Step  3
           it is said that:

                 "We will only go out for additional information in  certain
                 circumstances which would  lead  to  the  approval  of  the
                 application.

                 Before we go out to the applicant we must have  established
                 that evidence exists, or have sufficient reason to  believe
                 the information exists.   Examples  include  (but  are  not
                 limited to) bank statements missing from a series..."

           In step 4, it is indicated that:

                 "...where there  is  uncertainty  as  to  whether  evidence
                 exists benefit [sic] should be given to the  applicant  and
                 the evidence should be requested...."

           But that is in the particular context there specified.

      50.   It can be seen, then, that the overall intent was to afford some
           alleviation  to  the  harshness  of  the  requirements  of   the
           Immigration Rules  by  sanctioning,  in  certain  circumstances,
           requests for further information from applicants.  The  question
           is in these three cases: how far  did  the  process  instruction
           require the relevant caseworker to go?"


      (our emphasis)

17.   Judge Baldwin dealt with the appellant's submissions  in  relation  to
      the Policy at para 20 of the determination in the following terms:

      "20.  Mr. Makol very sensibly did not seek to waste the  time  of  the
           Tribunal by arguing that the evidence belatedly supplied by  the
           Appellant meant that he  met  the  requirements  of  the  Rules.
           Rather,  he  invited  me  to  remit  the  case   on   Evidential
           Flexibility Grounds. The requirements for  Tier  1  (Exceptional
           Talent) Migrants are numerous and it would not  be  unreasonable
           to expect that even those who are exceptionally  talented  might
           miss something. That is presumably why, when there is some minor
           error or omission, evidential flexibility  and  fairness  demand
           that an Applicant should be given the opportunity  to  put  that
           matter right. However, in the case of this Applicant there  were
           a whole series of such matters.  Furthermore,  if  it  took  the
           Appellant six months from the time of the Refusal to get  around
           to providing a Current Appointments Report there would  seem  to
           be no reason for believing he would have done so promptly had he
           been asked for this and all the other matters to be attended  to
           before the Application was considered further.  Lastly,  it  was
           very difficult to believe that the marketing leaflets  were  not
           created in a great hurry, as they self-evidently  would  inspire
           very little confidence in the company's ability to  provide  the
           services they offer. This Application, I find, was not one where
           it has been  shown  that  fairness  and  evidential  flexibility
           demanded the taking of a different course by the Respondent. The
           Appellant does not I find meet the requirements of the Rules."

      (our emphasis)

18.   The appellant accepts that the documentary evidence he  submitted  was
      deficient. We have set out the shortcomings at our para 5  above.  The
      shortcomings include the fact that the bank letter from State Bank  of
      India did not confirm that the funds were transferable and  disposable
      in the United Kingdom; that the telephone numbers of the third parties
      were not provided in the bank letter; and that the appellant  had  not
      provided evidence that he was registered as a director  of  a  new  or
      existing business. It is impossible to see how it  can  reasonably  be
      said that there was reason to believe  that  the  missing  information
      existed.  The funds may not have been transferable and  disposable  in
      the United Kingdom. The third  parties  may  not  have  had  telephone
      numbers. The appellant may not have been a director at the date of his
      application. it is not an answer to say that the benefit of the  doubt
      should have been given to the appellant pursuant to step 4, given that
      there was nothing to suggest  that  any  of  this  evidence  may  have
      existed.

19.   Accordingly, even if the Policy continued to exist in  the  same  form
      as the June 2011  version,  Judge  Baldwin  was  entirely  correct  to
      conclude that this was not a case in which fairness and the  terms  of
      the  Policy  demanded  that  the  respondent  give  the  appellant  an
      opportunity to adduce further documents.

20.   We turn to deal with the challenge to the reasoning of Judge  Baldwin.



21.   The first point was that Judge Baldwin  had  incorrectly  referred  to
      the "Tier 1 (Exceptional Talent) Migrants" category. It is argued that
      this meant that he  had  misunderstood  the  nature  of  the  case  or
      prepared his determination in a hurry.

22.   We accept that the sentence underlined  in  the  quote  from  para  20
      above does suggest that Judge Baldwin may well have mistakenly thought
      that the application was for an application for  leave  as  a  Tier  1
      (Exceptional Talent) Migrant category, although  we  have  also  noted
      that he had earlier (at paragraph 1 of  the  determination)  correctly
      described the category as the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant  category.
      Nevertheless, the essential point he was considering was  whether  the
      deficiencies on the face of the documents were such that the terms  of
      the Policy required the respondent to have requested the appellant  to
      provide further documents. Clearly, he  proceeded  to  undertake  that
      assessment. The appellant accepts that his documents were deficient in
      the ways and to the extent recorded in the decision letter. We do  not
      accept that the mistaken reference to a different category  makes  any
      difference to the Judge's assessment, especially given  our  attention
      has not been drawn to  any  relevant  differences  in  the  applicable
      requirements between the two categories.

23.   Second, it is said that the Judge  took  into  account  an  irrelevant
      consideration in commenting on the fact that  the  marketing  leaflets
      inspired very little confidence in the company's  ability  to  provide
      the services they offer. Mr. Makol submitted that the respondent  does
      not require the material to be produced in perfect English; she merely
      asks for it to be produced.

24.   We agree that this is a valid point, in the appellant's  favour.   Mr.
      Makol submitted  that  this  error  influenced  the  Judge's  ultimate
      decision to find against the appellant in relation to the  Policy  and
      not to remit the case to the Respondent. However, for the  reasons  we
      have  given  above,  such  were  the  shortcomings  in  the  documents
      submitted by the appellant with his  application  that  (even  if  the
      Policy existed at the date of his  application,  which  has  not  been
      shown) this error was not material to the Judge's ultimate decision.

25.   Third, it is said that all the  defects  in  the  documents  submitted
      with the appellant's application had been remedied by  the  submission
      of a bundle of documents at the hearing  before  the  Judge.  However,
      this simply ignores section 85A of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
      Asylum Act 2002 Act which precludes the appellant  from  relying  upon
      post-decision documents. The argument  amounts  to  no  more  than  an
      attempt to circumvent the prohibition in section 85A.

26.   Fourth, it is said that Judge Baldwin erred in  law  in  referring  to
      the  appellant  having  taken  six  months  to  produce   a   "current
      appointment  report".  It  is  said  that  this  showed  a   lack   of
      understanding on his part, in that, a "current appointment report" was
      an online document that can be printed on any date at  any  time.  Mr.
      Makol submitted that it was therefore incorrect to  suggest  that,  if
      the appellant had been asked to submit a "current appointment report",
      he would not have been able to do so.

27.   We reject this argument. In our judgment, it ignores the fact  that  a
      person may be a director one day and not the next. Even if a  "current
      appointment report" can be printed online on any date, that  does  not
      mean that there was online evidence in existence at the  date  of  the
      appellant's application to show that he  was  a  director  then.  That
      would depend on whether he was in fact a director then. Thus, even  if
      the respondent had  requested  the  appellant  to  provide  a  current
      appointment report within a specified period, his  ability  to  do  so
      within that period would depend upon whether he was a  director  then.
      In our judgment, there was no error in the Judge's reasoning  in  that
      respect.

28.   Mr. Makol placed heavy reliance on the fact that  the  respondent  had
      requested  documents  from  many   of   his   clients.   Despite   his
      protestations, he was in fact giving evidence.  It is not open to  him
      to do so. Further, and in any event, anecdotal evidence of  this  sort
      does not establish any practice that  is  widespread  and  unequivocal
      such as to give rise to any legitimate expectation  or  unfairness  in
      this case.

      Para 245AA

29.   As stated above, the Policy  was  incorporated  into  the  Immigration
      Rules in the form of para 245AA from 6 September 2012. Para 245AA  has
      itself been amended since it was first  brought  into  force  on  that
      date.

30.   We will say two things straightaway. First, para 245AA was not  argued
      before Judge Baldwin. Although Mr. Makol first sought to suggest  that
      he had raised it in his skeleton argument  before  Judge  Baldwin  and
      then that he had  done  so  at  the  hearing  before  the  Judge,  our
      examination of  the  skeleton  argument  and  the  Judge's  Record  of
      Proceedings revealed that there was in fact no mention at all of  para
      245AA in the proceedings before the Judge.

31.   Mr. Makol then informed is that he  had  submitted  to  Judge  Baldwin
      that  the  respondent's  decision  was  not  in  accordance  with  the
      Immigration Rules. He submitted that this was sufficient to oblige the
      Judge to consider para 245AA. We have no hesitation in rejecting  this
      submission.  In  our  judgment,  Judge  Baldwin  was  not  under   any
      obligation to embark upon  a  search  of  the  Immigration  Rules  for
      provisions which might be of  assistance  to  the  appellant.  It  was
      incumbent upon the appellant  and  his  representatives  to  draw  the
      attention of the Judge to para 245AA, if reliance was placed upon it.

32.   In our judgment, given that there was  no  specific  mention  of  para
      245AA before Judge Baldwin, he cannot be said to have erred in law  in
      failing to consider it. This is sufficient to dispose of  this  aspect
      of the appellant's case.

33.   However, and in any event, para 245AA does not assist  the  appellant.
      Before we give our reasons for saying so, we will quote the version of
      para 245AA that existed at the date of  the  appellant's  application.
      This is the version submitted by Mr. Tufan at the  hearing  before  us
      and which is as follows:


          "245AA. Documents not submitted with applications


          (a)     Where Part 6A or any appendices referred  to  in  Part  6A
              state that specified  documents  must  be  provided,  the  UK
              Border Agency will only consider  documents  that  have  been
              submitted  with  the  application,  and  will  only  consider
              documents submitted after  the  application  where  they  are
              submitted in accordance with subparagraph (b).


          (b)     If the applicant has submitted:


            (i)   A sequence of documents and some of the documents  in  the
                 sequence have  been  omitted  (for  example,  if  one  bank
                 statement from a series is missing);


            (ii)  A document in the wrong format; or


            (iii) A document that is a copy and not  an  original  document,
                 the UK Border Agency  may  contact  the  applicant  or  his
                 representative  in  writing,  and   request   the   correct
                 documents. The requested documents must be received by  the
                 UK Border Agency at the address specified  in  the  request
                 within 7 working days of the date of the request.


          (c)     The UK Border Agency will not request  documents  where  a
              specified document has not been  submitted  (for  example  an
              English language certificate is missing),  or  where  the  UK
              Border  Agency  does  not  anticipate  that  addressing   the
              omission or error referred to in subparagraph (b)  will  lead
              to a grant because the application will be refused for  other
              reasons.


          (d)     If the applicant has submitted a specified document:


            (i)   in the wrong format, or


            (ii)  that is a copy and not an original document,


            the application may be granted exceptionally, providing  the  UK
              Border Agency is satisfied that the specified  documents  are
              genuine and the applicant meets all the  other  requirements.
              The UK Border  Agency  reserves  the  right  to  request  the
              specified original documents in the  correct  format  in  all
              cases where (b) applies, and to refuse applications if  these
              documents are not provided as set out in (b)."

34.   The version that Mr. Makol relied upon in his grounds  of  application
      for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  different.  He
      relied upon the current version of para 245AA that came into force and
      applied to applications made on and after 1  October  2013.  The  main
      difference was that the current version of para 245AA (b) contains the
      following para (iv):

      "(iv) A document does not contain all of the specified information;"

35.   However, the applicable version was the version that  applied  at  the
      date of the appellant's application. Mr. Makol attempted to shoe  horn
      the deficiencies in the appellant's documents into one or more of para
      245AA(b) (i), (ii) and (iii). However, even if  para  245AA  had  been
      relied upon before Judge Baldwin (which is plainly not the  case),  he
      can only succeed in showing that the Judge erred in law and  that  the
      Judge's decision should be set aside if he can persuade is that  every
      single deficiency clearly falls within para 245AA. In our judgment, he
      falls far short of doing so, for reasons we will now give.

36.   We  have  no  hesitation  in  rejecting  Mr.  Makol's  submission,  in
      relation to the  bank  letter  not  confirming  that  the  funds  were
      transferable and disposable in the United Kingdom, that  the  document
      was in the wrong format. It is simply impossible to see how  this  can
      reasonably be said of the document.

37.   The same is true in relation to the fact that the bank letter did  not
      provide the telephone numbers of the third  parties.  In  relation  to
      both, the deficiency is  not  a  formatting  issue  but  (put  simply)
      information that is missing from the document.

38.   In relation to the fact that the appellant had failed  to  submit  his
      "current appointment report", we reject Mr.  Makol's  submission  that
      this document fell within para 245AA(b)(i). It was  not  part  of  any
      sequence or series of documents. A series of documents is one that has
      a beginning  and  an  end.  The  example  given  in  para  245AA(b)(i)
      exemplifies the point.

39.   In relation to the fact that the advertising material did not  mention
      the appellant's name and did not  state  what  services  his  business
      would be providing,  para  245(b)(i)  cannot  apply  because  what  is
      missing is information in the one document,  not  a  document  from  a
      sequence of documents.  Para  245AA(b)(ii)  cannot  apply  because  it
      cannot reasonably be said that the missing information means that  the
      document is in the wrong format.

40.   Finally, in relation to the discrepancy concerning the description  of
      the appellant's job, we cannot see how that can reasonably fall within
      para 245AA(b). The two documents presented to the respondent that gave
      rise to this discrepancy cannot be said to be in the wrong format. The
      appellant may well be able  to  produce  a  document  to  explain  the
      discrepancy but such a  document  cannot  reasonably  be  said  to  be
      missing from a sequence of documents.

41.   In reality,  Mr.  Makol  has  sought  to  adopt  an  unreasonable  and
      artificial interpretation of para 245AA(b). We reject his submissions.



42.   We have therefore concluded that Judge Baldwin made no material  error
      of law.

      Decision

      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve any error on
     a point of law.

      decision letter dated  4  June  2013  as:  "are  engaged  in  business
      activity other than work necessary to administer  his  business,".  We
      are satisfied that nothing turns on this in this case. ]
