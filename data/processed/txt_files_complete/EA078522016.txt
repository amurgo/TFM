Representation:
For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The Respondent, to whom I shall refer as the Claimant, is  a  national
of Romania, born on 4.10.95. On 29 June 2016, a decision was made to  remove
her from the United Kingdom pursuant to regulations 19(3)(a)  and  24(2)  of
the Immigration EEA Regulations 2006, on the basis that during an  interview
on  that  day,  the  Claimant  stated  that  she  did  not  have  meaningful
employment and had entered and exited the United  Kingdom  on  two  separate
occasions and that she had been encountered by Greater Manchester Police  in
June 2016 begging on Piccadilly.

2.    The Claimant appealed  against  this  decision  and  her  appeal  came
before First tier Tribunal Judge Shergill for hearing on 22 March  2017.  In
a decision and reasons promulgated on 6 April 2017, the  judge  allowed  the
appeal. The reasons provided were that the  Claimant  produced  an  original
letter from HMRC  dated  7.11.16  which  showed  that  she  declared  income
resulting from work selling the "Big Issue"  magazine  amounting  to  �4520.
The judge noted that this was topped up by working tax credit and child  tax
credit to �15,097.84. The judge further noted  that  no  tax  returns,  bank
receipts or bank statements had been provided and that the  declared  income
would be tax free [14]. However, the  judge  was  satisfied  that  the  HMRC
evidence was prima facie evidence that the Claimant  was  exercising  treaty
rights within the United Kingdom and regulation 6 of the  Immigration  (EEA)
Regulations 2006 [15].

3.    The judge noted that the evidence in relation to the Claimant's  self-
employment as poor and constituted receipts from the  offices  of  the  "Big
Issue" and no explanation as to how the Claimant  came  to  be  selling  the
magazine given that she has a fixed address. The  judge  considered  whether
the self-employment was "genuine and effective" or "marginal and  ancillary"
and concluded at [22] that the Secretary of State had failed to  demonstrate
that the evidential burden had been satisfied in  respect  of  an  abuse  of
rights, in light of the evidence from the HMRC and the absence  of  evidence
on the part of the Secretary of State to prove her case.

4.    The Secretary of State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
Tribunal,  in  time,  on  the  basis  that   the   judge's   findings   were
contradictory in that  at  [18]  the  judge  appears  to  concede  that  the
Claimant's self-employment was not meaningful based on  the  fact  that  the
Claimants income was only 22% of money coming in, the remainder  being  made
up of public funds. Consequently, if the  employment  was  not  genuine  and
meaningful then the Claimant has no  right  to  reside  in  the  UK  and  is
subject to administrative removal. It was further submitted that  the  judge
erred in considering the wrong relevant period ie. the  tax  year  2015-2016
rather than the date of the hearing cf. Boodhoo [2013] UKUT 00036 (IAC).

5.    Permission to appeal was granted by First tier Tribunal  Judge  Andrew
in a decision dated 19 October 2017, on the basis that there  were  arguable
errors of law in the decision for the reasons set  out  in  the  grounds  of
appeal.

Hearing

6.     At  the  hearing  before  me,  the  Claimant  appeared   in   person,
unrepresented but stated that she wished the appeal to proceed and that  she
was content to communicate in English.

7.    In his submissions, Mr Bates sought to rely on the grounds of  appeal.
He submitted that the First tier Tribunal Judge appears to have allowed  the
appeal on the basis of the HMRC assessment  provided  by  the  Claimant  but
also made  a  clear  indication  that  the  employment  was  not  meaningful
employment at [7]. The judge's findings of fact and reasoning  are  at  [14]
where he noted that there was no evidence of self-employment,  such  as  tax
returns, bank receipts and bank statements. At [16]-[17] the judge  made  no
positive findings and the judge was far from satisfied that the Claimant  is
undertaking bona fide self employment. At [17] he noted that the quality  of
the evidence is poor and at [18]  that  less  than  22%  of  the  Claimant's
income is from declared self-employment.

8.    Mr Bates submitted that,  even  if  self-employment  had  been  taking
place, the burden of proof was upon the Claimant  to  demonstrate  that  she
met the requirements of the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006  and  the
judge should have found that the Claimant failed to discharge the burden  of
proof, on the basis that her self-employment was marginal or  ancillary.  At
[23] the judge applied the wrong test  in  that  the  burden  was  upon  the
Claimant to show that she meets Regulation 6 and the judge failed to make  a
sustainable finding as to the Claimant's ability to  meet  the  Regulations.
Mr Bates submitted that, at the date of hearing, the Claimant had failed  to
establish that she was entitled to  residence  as  a  qualified  person  cf.
Boodhoo [2013] UKUT 00036 (IAC).

9.    Mr Bates informed the Upper Tribunal that there was no caselaw on  the
first issue in an immigration context but he handed up a copy of a  decision
from the Administrative Appeals Chamber in DV v SSWP [2017] UKUT 0155  (AAC)
where Upper Tribunal Judge Markus QC held, in a case with a  strong  factual
similarity to the extant appeal, that self-employment as a Big Issue  seller
was not economically viable when the bulk of that  Appellant's  income  came
from State benefits, holding at [16]:

    "...although motive  is  irrelevant  where  the  economic  activity  is
    genuine and effective, the  reason  for  continuing  with  an  activity
    particularly where that activity is not  economically  viable,  can  be
    relevant to the decision whether it is genuine and effective."

10.   The Claimant in response submitted that she had been paying tax;  that
her children are going to school and that she has been working  in  the  UK.
She added that her husband had also been working as an Uber driver.

11.   I reserved my decision, which I now give with my reasons.

Findings

12.   I find material errors of law in the decision of First  tier  Tribunal
Judge Shergill, for the reasons set out in the  grounds  of  appeal.  It  is
clear in light of the decision of the AAC in DV v  SSWP  (op  cit)  that  in
light of the fact that the Claimant's self-employment amounted to  only  22%
of her overall income, the remainder deriving from State benefits, that  her
economic activity was not viable and thus  is  marginal  and  ancillary  and
cannot  properly  be  considered  as  genuine  and  effective  cf.  Jany   v
Staatssecretaris van Justitie Case C-268/99 [2001] ECR 1-8615 at [33].

13.   Whilst the decision in Boodhoo (op cit) did not state  in  terms  that
the relevant date for consideration of the evidence in an EEA appeal is  the
date of hearing, the Upper Tribunal found that a tribunal has the  power  to
consider any evidence which it thinks  relevant  to  the  substance  of  the
decision, including evidence which concerns a matter arising after the  date
of decision. Mr Bates' better point was that there was  simply  no  evidence
apart from the letter from HMRC dated 7.11.16 relating to the 2015/2016  tax
year that the Claimant was working and thus the judge erred in finding  that
she discharged the evidential burden of proof.

Decision

14.   I find material errors of law in the decision of First  tier  Tribunal
Judge Shergill.  I  set  that  decision  aside  and  re-make  the  decision,
dismissing the appeal.

15.   The Claimant informed me that she has been working and paying  tax  in
the United Kingdom and her husband has also been working.  Thus  it  remains
open to her or her husband to make an application to the Secretary of  State
for a residence card as recognition of their right to remain  on  the  basis
of an exercise of Treaty rights as  EEA  nationals  working  in  the  United
Kingdom.
