For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


   1. By a decision sent to the parties on 16 April 2021 the Upper  Tribunal
      set aside a decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  the  reasons
      stated.




Preliminary issue

   2. The directions given by the  Upper  Tribunal  specifically  stated  at
      paragraph  20(iii)  "The  appellant's  representatives  must   confirm
      whether an interpreter is required and if so,  in  what  language  and
      dialect, and for whom."  As  no  such  confirmation  was  received  no
      interpreter was booked for the hearing.
   3. Mr Shea stated, notwithstanding the fact the sponsor has lived in  the
      United Kingdom for a number of years, that  the  sponsor  required  an
      interpreter to give his evidence.
   4. The directions also provided that the witness  statements  filed  will
      stand as the evidence in  chief  of  the  maker.  The  statements  are
      written in English with the sponsor's witness statement of 20  October
      2020 containing no endorsement that it needed to be read back  to  him
      and translated into any other language that he understood. Mr  McVeety
      also  confirmed  that,  whilst  not  accepting  the  content  of   the
      statement, he had no cross examination.
   5. As it was not necessary for the Sponsor  to  give  oral  evidence  the
      absence of the interpreter did not prevent the appellant  receiving  a
      fair hearing, which proceeded by way  of  submissions  only  from  the
      advocates.

Background

   6. On 20 November 2019 Mr Ifitikar made an online application for an  EEA
      Family Permit to enable him to join  his  uncle,  Mr  Amin  Babar,  an
      Italian Citizen ('the Sponsor') who is exercising treaty rights in the
      United Kingdom.
   7. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 30 December  1997,  who
      describes himself as being single and who lives in Gujarat District in
      Pakistan in the family home. He was born on 30 December 1997.
   8. An Entry  Clearance  Officer  (ECO)  considered  the  application  but
      refused it on 16 December 2019 for the following reasons:

      The Decision


         . You have previously been refused a Family Permit on 16 September
           2016, due to insufficient evidence  that  you  are  an  extended
           family member of a qualified EEA national under regulation 8  of
           the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations.  I  have
           considered  the  information  in  relation  to   your   previous
           application and all  documents  you  have  submitted  with  your
           current application based on all the  information  available  on
           its own merit and the decision is as follows.


         . You state that your uncle Amin Babar is an Italian national. You
           have provided  evidence  that  your  sponsor  holds  an  Italian
           identity card.


         . Only those family members referred to under  Article  2  of  the
           Directive 2004/38/EC have an automatic right to join  a  company
           the EEA family member to  another  member  state  when  the  EEA
           national is exercising a Treaty right.


         . Article 3 of Directive  2004/38/EC  provides  the  basis  for  a
           member state to consider  other  relatives,  such  as  'extended
           family members' and determine the terms of entry  and  residence
           to such 'beneficiaries' in accordance with  their  own  domestic
           legislation. (Article 3 (2)).


         . The United Kingdom has transposed the terms of  Article  3  into
           Regulation  8  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic   Area)
           Regulations 2016. As Regulation 8(4)  makes  clear,  the  United
           Kingdom is allowed to set terms and allow them to reside in  the
           United Kingdom are family members of an EEA national.


         . In accordance with Regulation 8(2)(b) of the EEA Regulation 2016
           (as  amended)  an  extended   family   member   applicant   must
           demonstrate they were either:


              dependent on the EEA national in a country other than the UK


              a member of the EEA nationals household in  a  country  other
              than the UK


         . You state that your sponsor has resided in  the  United  Kingdom
           since 16 September 2016. You are claiming to be  dependent  upon
           your EEA sponsor and have provided nine money transfer  receipts
           from  your  sponsor  via  Small  World  and  Express  Currencies
           covering a period from 2 March 2019 to 4 November 2019, you have
           also provided a transfer statement covering the period  from  19
           January 2019 to 29 May 2019. However, it is noted that you  have
           provided no evidence that you received any of the  funds  listed
           on the statement  and  it  is  also  noted  that  your  transfer
           receipts  only  cover  the  period  immediately  prior  to  your
           application (with the last  nine  months).  Unfortunately,  this
           limited amount of evidence in isolation does not prove that  you
           are financially dependent on your sponsor. I would expect to see
           substantial  evidence  of  this   over   a   prolonged   period,
           considering the length of time your sponsor has been resident in
           the United Kingdom.


         . It is also noted that you have not provided any evidence such as
           your own and your mother's bank statements  or  other  documents
           indicating financial ingoing and outgoings. In  the  absence  of
           this evidence, this  department  cannot  sufficiently  establish
           your dependency, either wholly or partly, upon your EEA sponsor.


         . I would also expect to see evidence which fully details  sponsor
           circumstances  which  you  have  not  provided.  Their   income,
           expenditure and evidence of their household members, which would
           prove that they are able to meet your essential living needs  as
           well as their own.


         . Home Office records and the documents you  have  provided,  show
           that your sponsor resides with  his  spouse  and  at  least  two
           dependent children. The documents you have provided,  show  that
           your sponsor earns an average of ï¿½1280 per  month.  Due  to  his
           income and dependent household members, I am not satisfied  that
           it is sustainable for your sponsor to  financially  support  you
           while meeting his own needs and the needs of his family  members
           for are already be reliant upon him.


         . Furthermore, upon inspection of your sponsor's bank  statements.
           It has been noted  that  your  sponsor  receives  public  funds,
           namely Universal Credit from the Department of Work and Pensions
           (DWP) (an average of 665 per month). Universal Credit  is  means
           tested, which is assessed according to a household's income  and
           the household make up. This means the  DWP  have  assessed  your
           sponsor circumstances and awarded them public funds due to their
           low income and their dependent household. These funds have  been
           awarded to assist your sponsor in meeting  their  own  essential
           needs and the  needs  of  their  own  household  in  the  United
           Kingdom. Consequently, I am not satisfied that your  sponsor  is
           currently able to support you financially or be able to continue
           to support you should you arrive in the United Kingdom.


         . On the evidence submitted in support of your application and  on
           the balance of probability  I am not satisfied you are dependent
           on your sponsor.


         . In view of your failure to provide satisfactory evidence,  I  am
           not satisfied that you are the extended family member of an  EEA
           national in accordance with  Regulation  8  of  the  Immigration
           (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.


        I therefore refuse your EEA Family Permit application because I  am
        not satisfied that you meet all the requirements of  regulation  12
        (see ECGs EUN2.23) of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
        Regulations 2016.

   9. Following the lodging of the appeal the decision was  reviewed  by  an
      Entry Clearance Manager (ECM) who, in a decision dated 16 April  2020,
      wrote:

        I have reviewed the  grounds  of  appeal  and  all  the  supporting
        documents submitted with the appeal papers.


        Based on  the  refusal  notice  and  the  additional  documentation
        submitted, I am satisfied the  original  decision  to  refuse  were
        correct. The decision is therefore in accordance with the  law  and
        the EEA Regulations and I am not prepared to exercise discretion in
        the appellant's case.


        It is acknowledged  that  you  have  provided  a  number  of  money
        transfer receipts, however, you have  failed  to  show  that  money
        provided by your sponsor is for essential means. You have failed to
        provide  any  evidence  of  bank  statements  or  other   documents
        indicating financial ingoing and outgoings.


        Given all of the above considerations, I maintain the ECO's initial
        decision to refuse entry clearance.

  10. The First-tier Tribunal set out the appellant's claim  between  [19  -
      21] of that decision in the following terms:

      19.     The Appellant's claim, contained in the statement submitted on
        his behalf by his  representatives,  and  in  the  other  documents
        submitted for the purposes of the hearing, is that his  Sponsor  is
        his uncle, upon whom he has been dependent  since  his  own  father
        passed away in April 2017. He states that when  his  father  passed
        away it was very tragic for his family in Pakistan as  he  was  the
        only source of income for the family. After his  death,  his  uncle
        took responsibility to support him and his family as  he  was  then
        the only source of income for them. He states that the Sponsor  has
        been a father figure for him as he financially and morally supports
        him.


      20.     He states that his uncle has  been  living  in  the  UK  since
        September 2016 and he is working as a  car  mechanic  at  Longsight
        Auto Repairs Ltd. He can confirm that the money his uncle sends  to
        him, does support him and covers his expenditures, including  food,
        accommodation. When he made his application in  November  2019,  he
        provided the money transfer transaction statements dating  back  to
        19 January 2017 and this covers a period of 2 years and 10  months.
        He submits that it is not correct for the Respondent to allege that
        the evidence is limited and covers only the immediate period.


      21.     He further states that he is currently studying at college and
        has never worked in his life. He  has  no  bank  account  or  other
        source of income of his own. His main expenditure are  things  like
        food and groceries, college fees, mobile top  ups,  buying  clothes
        and travel expenses. He has provided evidence of  his  expenditure,
        but states that it is not  common  practice  to  keep  receipts  of
        everything you buy and that  shopkeepers  often  do  not  give  out
        receipts. In addition to this it is  very  hard  to  find  work  in
        Pakistan. He is wholly reliant on his uncle and asks  that  in  the
        circumstances his appeal is allowed.


Discussion

  11. Although the appellant seemed to suggest in his own evidence that  the
      only source of financial support was from the sponsor, it also appears
      that there was  evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
      sponsor's father also contributes to the household in Pakistan and has
      done so since the appellant's father died.
  12. The information provided in response  to  directions  from  the  Upper
      Tribunal was again limited, being further example of remittances  sent
      and a copy of the UK-based sponsor's bank statements.
  13. Mr Shea submitted that the money sent by the sponsor  in  the  UK  was
      solely for the appellant and that he was reliant in  its  entirety  on
      the money from his uncle. The appellant had stated he uses  the  money
      from his uncle to pay his  college  fees  and  that  whilst  accepting
      education is not an essential needs, that he also uses the same to pay
      for food, clothing, and to meet his own needs.
  14. Whilst Mr Shay  referred  to  the  grant  of  permission  against  the
      decision of the First-tier Tribunal matters have gone beyond that  and
      the decision of the Upper Tribunal is the one that sets out the  scope
      of this hearing. In that document it is noted:

      39. Mr Walker relied upon the decision in Moneke (EEA - OFMs)  Nigeria
        [2011] UKUT 00341(IAC) in which at [41] the Tribunal accepted  that
        the definition of dependency was accurately captured by the current
        UKBA ECIs which read as follows at ch.5.12: "In  determining  if  a
        family  member  or  extended  family  member  is  dependent   (i.e.
        financially  dependent)  on  the  relevant  EEA  national  for  the
        purposes of the EEA Regulations:  Financial  dependency  should  be
        interpreted as meaning that the person needs financial support from
        the EEA national or his/ her spouse/civil partner in order to  meet
        his/her essential needs - not in order to have a certain  level  of
        income. Provided a  person  would  not  be  able  to  meet  his/her
        essential living needs without the financial  support  of  the  EEA
        national, s/he should be considered dependent on that national.  In
        those circumstances, it does not matter that the applicant  may  in
        addition receive financial support /  income  from  other  sources.
        There is no need to determine  the  reasons  for  recourse  to  the
        financial support provided by  the  EEA  national  or  to  consider
        whether the applicant is able to support him/herself by  taking  up
        paid employment. The person does not need  to  be  living  or  have
        lived in an EEA state which the EEA national sponsor also lives  or
        has lived." At paragraph 42 the Tribunal  went  on  "We  of  course
        accept (and as the ECIs reflect) that dependency does not  have  to
        be "necessary" in the sense of the Immigration Rules,  that  is  to
        say an able-bodied person who chooses to  rely  for  his  essential
        needs on material support of the sponsor may be entitled to  do  so
        even if he  could  meet  those  needs  from  his  or  her  economic
        activity."


      40. The Secretary of State's argument is  that  the  Judge  failed  to
        properly analyse and make findings upon the question of whether the
        appellant is a person who would not be able to meet  his  essential
        living needs without the financial support of the EEA national.  To
        answer this question would have required a detailed analysis of the
        financial circumstances of Mr Iftikhar and  his  home  environment.
        This is an issue  specifically  raised  by  the  ECO  who  was  not
        satisfied that sufficient material had been provided  to  establish
        dependency. The EEA national sponsor in the  United  Kingdom  could
        well have been paying ï¿½100 per month, as found by the Judge, but it
        also appears that other sources of income were being paid into  the
        family household and there is no specific finding by the Judge that
        the income from  other  sources  was  not  sufficient  to  meet  Mr
        Ifikhar's essential needs, including his college fees.  Whilst  the
        Judge finds that the fees are paid from the  ï¿½100  per  month  that
        does not specifically answer this question. If the Judge had  found
        in the paragraphs set out above that the income being paid into the
        household of which is part in Pakistan was insufficient, such  that
        without assistance from the sponsor Mr Ifikhar would not be able to
        meet his essential needs, the Secretary of State will  be  in  some
        difficulty. The Judge notes that  the  sponsor  does  not  need  to
        provide financial  support  for  all  those  in  the  household  in
        Pakistan but chooses to make payments to Mr Ifikhar. The fact  such
        payments are made does not, per se, establish dependence  in  light
        of the required legal test.

  15. It is not disputed that the Sponsor in the  UK  is  sending  money  to
      Pakistan, but just sending money is not sufficient. Mr McVeety noted a
      trend arising in cases of money being sent to  an  individual  abroad,
      claiming it is a payment that is to meet a dependency,  even  if  that
      person lives within a family unit with  no  evidence  of  the  overall
      income and outgoings of the unit in which the recipient lives.
  16. The appellant lives  within  the  family  home  in  Pakistan.  It  was
      submitted by Mr McVeety that there are five members of the  household,
      and the appellant was claiming nobody else  in  the  household  works.
      Whilst the First-tier Tribunal mentions an income from  other  sources
      it was not clear before the ECO or since whether the  monies  received
      within the householder are sufficient to meet all  the  needs  of  the
      family, or whether the sum  paid  by  the  Sponsor  is  only  for  the
      appellant and, if so, why he needs ï¿½100.
  17. I find there is merit in Mr McVeety's submission of a lack of  candour
      regarding the family circumstances, their needs, and  what  the  money
      from all sources is used for, a situation that has  prevailed  despite
      it being made clear by the Upper Tribunal on the  last  occasion  what
      type of evidence needed to be provided.
  18. It is not disputed that money is sent  from  the  United  Kingdom  and
      received, but the issue has always been what that money  is  used  for
      and whether it is necessary to meet the needs of the family  unit.  If
      payments from other sources  are  sufficient  to  meet  the  essential
      needs, and particularly if there are savings, the Sponsors payments do
      not establish the required dependency.
  19. I accept in some cases it could be argued that if it  was  established
      that the only income received was by way of  remittances  from  abroad
      that may be sufficient, but this  is  not  so  in  this  case  as  the
      appellant has to be dependent upon the EEA national,  and  it  is  not
      made out the Sponsors father is himself an EEA national. Any  payments
      that the father is therefore making are not payments  and  establishes
      dependency in accordance with the Regulations.
  20. The requirement for more detailed  proof  has  been  there  since  the
      refusal by the ECO and yet it is still not clear  whether  the  monies
      form the Sponsor are used to improve the standard  of  living  of  the
      family who do not need the  same  to  meet  essential  expenditure  or
      whether they are required for this purpose. That is the  key  question
      in an appeal of this nature, yet which does not appear  to  have  been
      adequately addressed.
  21. It is not credible that the ï¿½100 would only have been sent to meet the
      needs of the appellant and leave other members of the household,  such
      as the appellant's mother and siblings with no income at all and  with
      insufficient to meet their own essential needs. The lack of clarity in
      the evidence still means that the true position is not known.
  22. It is not made out that the evidence  required  is  not  available  or
      could not have been provided. There is other income, as  indicated  by
      the First-tier Tribunal, but the extent of that income and expenditure
      of the family unit and whether the appellant's essential needs  cannot
      be met without the payment from the Sponsor has  not  been  disclosed.
      This prevents the detailed examination  of  the  family  circumstances
      requiring by case law and ability to satisfy the Regulations.
  23. Whilst Mr Shae argued the submission to this effect made by Mr McVeety
      was a position  not  supported  by  the  evidence,  I  find  they  are
      submissions to weight may be given. It  is  not  speculation  to  note
      there is more than one member of this  household,  to  note  that  the
      members of the household must have essential needs of their own and as
      a whole, and to comment upon the lack of candour and  clarity  in  the
      evidence provided, notwithstanding the issues always being known.
  24. Repeating the claim that the transfers from the UK-based  sponsor  are
      to meet the appellant's needs  and  that  any  other  submissions  are
      irrelevant, fails to focus on the core  question  in  this  appeal  of
      whether the appellant had established that the support of the  Sponsor
      is required to meet his essential needs in Pakistan.
  25. I make no comment upon the fact the Sponsor appears to be a receipt to
      public funds as the bank statement show he has more  coming  into  his
      account than is going out to Pakistan.
  26. The burden of proving an entitlement to the Family Permits falls  upon
      the appellant. I find on the evidence he  chooses  to  make  available
      that he has failed to discharge the burden upon him to establish  that
      he is entitled to the family permit. As the appellant has  not  proved
      he is a person who would not be able  to  meet  his  essential  living
      needs without the financial support of the EEA national, the appeal is
      dismissed.

Decision

  27. I dismiss the appeal.

   Anonymity.

  28. The First-tier Tribunal made no order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the
      Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005. I make no such
      order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
      Rules 2008.
