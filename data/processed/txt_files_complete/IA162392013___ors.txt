Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Hawkin, counsel, instructed by Deccan Prime
solicitors Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is the appeal of Arpitaben Jyotindrabhai Patel  whose  application
    for further leave to remain as a student was refused and her  husband's
    and daughter's applications were refused as her dependants.

2.   The application was refused on the basis of  the  language  test.   The
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  acknowledged   that   there   were   three
    certificates and unfortunately erred in finding that the  results  from
    the three certificates had to be in one certificate.  This  requirement
    of the Immigration Rules did not come into effect  until  October  2013
    which postdated the date of  the  decision  which  is  the  subject  of
    challenge.

   3. Mr Bramble for the  Secretary  of  State  accepted  that  this  was  a
      material error of law and consented to the decision being  set  aside.
      In the light of the evidence  that  was  produced  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal and to the Secretary of State, the appeal is successful.  The
      appellants meet the requirements of the Rules in force at the date  of
      decision.


   Conclusion

     There is an error  of  law  in  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision such that the decision is set aside to be remade.

     I remake the decision and allow the appeal.
