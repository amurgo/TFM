                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. In a decision promulgated on  6  December  2017,  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge  Burnett  dismissed   the   appellant's   appeal   against   the
      respondent's decision to refuse his asylum and human rights claim. The
      appellant sought, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper
      Tribunal against Judge Burnett's decision.

   2. In a Rule 24 response dated 20 November 2018, the Respondent does  not
      oppose the application for permission  and  invites  the  Tribunal  to
      remit the case to the First-tier  Tribunal  in  order  for  clear  and
      sustainable findings to be made on  the  appellant's  nationality  and
      history.

   3. In the circumstances I set aside the decision  of  Judge  Burnett  and
      remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

DECISION

   4. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  set  aside.
      The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal, to  be  dealt  with
      afresh pursuant to section 12(2)(b)(i) of the  Tribunals,  Courts  and
      Enforcement Act 2007 and Practice Statement 7.2(b), before  any  judge
      aside from Judge Burnett.



    Anonymity

    The First-tier Tribunal made an order for  anonymity.  I  continue  the
    order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008.
