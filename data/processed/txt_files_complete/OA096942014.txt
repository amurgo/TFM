Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss Johnstone (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mrs Bhachu (Counsel)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant ('the SSHD') appeals against a decision of First-tier
         Tribunal Judge  DJ  Dickinson  dated  12  May  2015  in  which  the
         respondent's appeal against the decision of  the  ECO  was  allowed
         under the Immigration Rules.

      2. Judge Dickinson was satisfied that the sponsor had a  gross  income
         of at least ï¿½18600 at the date of his application.  This was  based
         upon a combination of an  acceptance  of  the  sponsor's  oral  and
         documentary evidence.

      3. In grounds of appeal the ECO submitted that the Judge erred in  law
         in allowing  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  when  the
         necessary specified evidence was not available to the  ECO.   Judge
         Grant-Hutchinson granted permission to appeal on this basis.

      4. The matter now comes before me to  consider  whether  the  decision
         contains an error of law.

Error of law

      5. Mrs Bhachu accepted that the Judge erred in  law  in  allowing  the
         appeal under the Rules.  She accepted  that  in  order  to  succeed
         under the Rules the respondent needed to establish  that  that  she
         had provided the specified evidence necessary for the sponsor's non-
         employment income as set out in  Appendix  FM-SE  10.   Mrs  Bhachu
         acknowledged that the specified evidence was not available  to  the
         ECO or the Judge and remains unavailable.  It  is  clear  that  the
         Judge accepted the sponsor's claim to earn income in excess of  the
         minimum financial threshold.  That however  is  not  sufficient  to
         allow the appeal under the Rules.  The  Judge  also  needed  to  be
         satisfied that this was supported by specified evidence.   In  this
         case that included "personal  bank  statements  for  the  12  month
         period prior to the date of application showing the  income  relied
         upon was paid into an account".   The Judge heard evidence from the
         sponsor that  the  rental  income  from  properties  was  not  paid
         directly into his bank account but was paid  by  way  of  cash  and
         utilised by the sponsor for his personal expenses.

      6. In  allowing  the  appeal  without  specified  evidence  the  Judge
         impermissibly disregarded mandatory requirements of the Rules  that
         had to be met.  As Mrs Bhachu correctly conceded this constitutes a
         clear error of law.

      7. Mrs Bhachu also submitted that the Judge should have  remitted  the
         case to the ECO for a decision to be retaken  'on  a  discretionary
         basis' in light of  the  findings  of  fact  made.   There  was  no
         respondent's notice to support this submission, which was made  for
         the first time at the hearing.  I asked Mrs Bhachu whether she  was
         able to provide any authority to support this  submission  but  she
         was unable to do so.  In the absence of the argument being  put  to
         the Judge or in a respondent's notice, and in the  absence  of  any
         authority to support the submission I am  not  prepared  to  accept
         this submission.

Re-making the decision

      8. Both representatives agreed that I  should  go  on  to  remake  the
         decision.  By paragraph 7.2 of the relevant practice statement  for
         appeals on or after 25 September 2012, I must be satisfied that:

             "... the nature or extent of any judicial fact  finding  which
             is necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-
             made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
             in rule 2 it is appropriate to remit the case  to  the  First-
             tier Tribunal."

      9. I was satisfied that any further fact  finding  was  likely  to  be
         minimal and  decided  that  it  was  proportionate  to  remake  the
         decision myself.

     10. Mrs Bhachu acknowledged that the appeal was bound to fail under the
         Rules and accepted that the only issue  in  dispute  was  therefore
         Article 8.

     11. I heard evidence  from  the  sponsor.   He  confirmed  his  witness
         statement and  was cross-examined by Miss Johnstone.  He  explained
         that he was  still  unable  to  demonstrate  by  way  of  specified
         evidence that the rental income was paid into his bank account  but
         would be able to do so for a period of 12 months before May 2016 as
         he had begun to pay the rental income into his  bank  account  from
         May 2015.  He also explained that it was  stressful  and  difficult
         being apart from his wife but that he could not join her even on  a
         temporary basis (for more than a holiday of a few  weeks  duration)
         because he had to look after his ill mother in the UK  as  well  as
         his properties.

     12. Miss Johnstone  asked  me  to  find  that  there  was  insufficient
         evidence of compelling circumstances to support the grant of  entry
         clearance outside the Rules.  Mrs Bhachu invited me  to  find  that
         there are a number of compelling reasons to support a finding  that
         refusal of entry clearance in this case would amount to a breach of
         Article 8.

     13. At the end of submissions I  reserved  my  decision,  which  I  now
         provide with reasons.

     14. Mrs Bhachu accepted that the correct approach  to  whether  or  not
         entry clearance should be granted outside the Rules is set  out  in
         SSHD v SS  Congo  and  others  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387  and  I  have
         approached this case with that guidance in mind.

     15. The respondent cannot meet the requirements of the Rules.  Although
         the respondent can meet the minimum financial threshold in Appendix
         FM, that does not diminish the simple and uncontested fact that the
         need for specified evidence within the Rules in Appendix FM-SE  has
         not been met.  As observed by Richards LJ in SS (Congo) at [52  and
         53] the 'evidence rules' have  the  same  general  public  interest
         objective as the 'substantive rules'  -  to  limit  the  risk  that
         someone becomes a burden on  public  resources  by  requiring  more
         certain  and  objective  evidence.   Second,  the  application   of
         standard evidence rules is an important  means  of  minimising  the
         risk of arbitrary unfairness between applicants, keeping the  costs
         of administration within bounds and  ensuring  a  prompt  and  fair
         application of the substantive rules.

     16. In effect  the  respondent  has  asked  to  be  given  preferential
         treatment with respect to  the  evidential  requirements  than  the
         Rules call for.  In these circumstances it  is  necessary  to  give
         individualised consideration of the case to determine  whether  the
         interests of the individuals are of a particularly pressing  nature
         and that good reasons have been put forward to justify  this.   The
         appropriate general formulation for  this  category  is  that  such
         cases will arise where an applicant for entry  clearance  can  show
         that compelling circumstances exist  (which  are  not  sufficiently
         recognised under the new  Rules)  to  require  such  a  grant  (see
         Richards LJ at [40 and 53] of SS (Congo)).

     17. I have considered all the  relevant  considerations  including  the
         factors set out at section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and
         Asylum Act 2002.  I acknowledge that it is in the  public  interest
         that persons who seek to enter the UK are financially  independent.
         I accept that on  the  Judge's  findings  the  respondent  will  be
         financially independent.  Mrs Bhachu did not draw my  attention  to
         any  evidence  on  this  but  I  am  prepared  to  assume  in   the
         respondent's favour that she can speak English.  However as pointed
         out in AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC) an  applicant  can
         obtain no positive right to remain or enter from sections 117B  (2)
         or (3), whatever the degree  of  her  fluency  in  English  or  the
         strength  of   her   financial   resources.    All   the   relevant
         circumstances must be viewed in the round - Dube (ss117A-D)  [2015]
         UKUT 90 (IAC).

     18. Having considered all the relevant evidence I  make  the  following
         findings.

          i. The respondent and the sponsor have a genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship.  They are married and have a family life for the
             purposes of Article 8(1).  They have a  family  life  together
             and wish to develop that family life in the UK.  The  UK  must
             act in a manner to allow ties between close family members  to
             develop normally.

         ii. However Article 8 imposes no general obligation on the  UK  to
             facilitate the choice made by a married couple  to  reside  in
             the UK.  I am satisfied that it would be  reasonable  for  the
             sponsor to reside in Pakistan with his spouse.  He has  strong
             links to Pakistan.  He told me that both  he  and  his  family
             members visit regularly.  Whilst I accept the sponsor also has
             strong links to the UK I do not accept his evidence  that  his
             mother is dependent on him to care for her or  that  he  cares
             for her in any substantial manner.  The evidence on  this  was
             vague and unsupported by any medical evidence.  In  any  event
             the sponsor's mother has a husband and two other children  who
             can share any caring responsibilities.  The  sponsor  told  me
             that his brother has  assisted  him  in  collecting  rent  and
             looking after his properties when he  has  been  away  in  the
             past.   I  am  satisfied  that  the  sponsor  can   make   the
             appropriate arrangements for his properties to be looked after
             in  his  absence  and  in  all  the  circumstances  he   could
             reasonably reside with his wife in Pakistan until any  further
             application for entry  clearance  is  successful.   I  do  not
             therefore consider that in not granting entry clearance to the
             respondent the UK  is  interfering  with  the  development  of
             family life between the  respondent  and  the  sponsor.   That
             family life can be reasonably developed in Pakistan.

        iii. If I am wrong about this I have gone on  to  consider  whether
             compassionate circumstances exist.  This is a fairly demanding
             test (see Richards LJ at [41]).  I am not satisfied this  test
             is met in this case.  The only striking feature of  this  case
             is that the substantive rules are met  and  not  the  evidence
             rules.  For the reasons outlined in paragraph 15  there  is  a
             general public interest  objective  in  meeting  the  evidence
             rules.  The fact that they are not met  is  not  a  compelling
             factor and compelling  circumstances  must  exist  to  justify
             entry clearance where the evidence  rules  are  not  met  (see
             Richards LJ at [51]).   It might be said that this case  is  a
             'near miss'.  As observed by Richards LJ at [55] a  near  miss
             case  in  itself  will  by  "no  means  show  that  compelling
             circumstances exist".  I must consider whether there  are  any
             compelling circumstances, which when taken together  with  the
             fact that this is a 'near miss' case tips  the  balance  under
             Article 8 in the respondent's favour.  The respondent told  me
             that he will be visiting Pakistan soon and intends to spend  a
             number of weeks there.  He also believes  that  he  should  be
             able to comply with the evidence Rules  by  May  2016  when  a
             fresh application can be made.  I do not accept the  sponsor's
             evidence regarding his mother's illness or the  care  that  he
             provides for her.  I do not accept there are any compassionate
             circumstances in this case.  There are simply no good  reasons
             in this case to support giving  this  respondent  and  sponsor
             preferential treatment with respect to the evidence rules.

     19. Having considered all relevant factors I do not  accept  there  are
         compassionate circumstances in this case.  I  do  not  accept  that
         Article 8(1) will be breached by not granting the respondent  entry
         clearance as family life can exist in Pakistan.  Even if I am wrong
         about this and family life cannot reasonably exist  in  Pakistan  I
         have carried out the relevant balancing exercise and I am satisfied
         that the  public  interest  in  maintaining  effective  immigration
         control  and  the  economic  well-being  of  the  UK  and  are  not
         outweighed by all the relevant factors in this case, where as  here
         there is an absence of compassionate circumstances.

     20. I do not accept that the ECO's decision will breach Article  8  for
         the reasons set out above.

Decision

     21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  a
         material error of law and I set it aside.

     22. I have remade the decision and  I  dismiss  the  appeal  under  the
         Immigration Rules and under Article 8 of the ECHR.
