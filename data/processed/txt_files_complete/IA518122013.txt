                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R O Ojukotola of Messrs by S L A Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The Secretary of State appeals, with permission, against a decision  of
    Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Courtney  who  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 12 June 2014 allowed the appeal of Mr Adebowale Adelodun
    against a decision of the Secretary of State made on 13  June  2013  to
    refuse him an extension of  stay  as  a  visitor  for  private  medical
    treatment.

2.   Although the Secretary of State is the appellant before me I  will  for
    ease of reference refer to  her  as  the  respondent  as  she  was  the
    respondent in the First-tier Tribunal.  Similarly I will  refer  to  Mr
    Adebowale Adelodun as the appellant as he  was  the  appellant  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

3.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 2 June 1938  who  entered
    Britain as a visitor on 7 December 2012.  Before his  leave  to  remain
    ended he made an application for an extension of stay as a visitor  for
    private  medical  treatment.   When  refusing  that   application   the
    Secretary of State referred to the provisions of paragraph  41  of  the
    Rules and those in  paragraph  51(ii)-(v)  and  then  referred  to  the
    requirements in paragraph 54 of the Rules.  Those  requirements  stated
    that the applicant must produce evidence in the form  of  a  letter  on
    headed notepaper giving a private practice or hospital address  from  a
    registered medical practitioner who holds an NHS consultant post or who
    appeared in the special register of the GMC.  The letter has to provide
    details of the nature  of  the  illness,  the  proposed  or  continuing
    treatment, the frequency of consultations, the probable duration of the
    treatment, details of the cost of treatment and confirmation  that  all
    expenses were being met and, where treatment amounted to private visits
    to a consultant for a relatively minor ailment, details of the progress
    being made.  The Rule at (iii) also required that the  applicant  would
    have to provide that:

         "He has met out of the resources available to him,  any  costs  and
         expenses incurred in  relation  to  his  treatment  in  the  United
         Kingdom and (iv) provided evidence that  he  has  sufficient  funds
         available to him in the United Kingdom or, if relying on funds from
         abroad,  has  provided  evidence  that  those   funds   are   fully
         transferable to the United Kingdom, to meet the likely costs of his
         treatment and intends to meet those costs."

     It appears that the appellant also had, in his application stated  that
    he wished to care for his son  who  was  settled  in  Britain  and  had
    various illnesses but that part of the application was refused and  was
    not raised again in the appeal.  The letter of refusal also pointed out
    that the appellant could not meet the requirements of the private  life
    requirements of the Rules.

4.   In her determination the judge set out the  requirements  in  paragraph
    54 of the Rules as listed above  and  then  set  out  her  findings  in
    paragraphs  9  onwards  of  the  determination.   She  noted  that  the
    appellant was suffering from an enlarged prostate gland  and  that  his
    condition had been diagnosed after his arrival in Britain  in  December
    2012.  He had entered into agreement with Kings College Hospital to pay
    the costs of the  treatment he had had in monthly instalments - a total
    of �1,687.27 in all and had a catheter inserted and had been prescribed
    Finasteride.  She noted that a doctor from King's College  had  written
    that she had referred the appellant for a  renal  review  and  that  he
    required surgery to "disobstruct" the prostate and that the doctor  had
    said that "I booked  him  for  a  photoselective  vaporisation  of  the
    prostate with Green Light laser  which  should  be  done  in  the  near
    future".  She noted the appellant's evidence that he had been told that
    he might be called for an operation at any time.  No up-to-date medical
    report had been supplied but the  Judge  stated  that  the  appellant's
    daughter, whom she found to be entirely credible had confirmed that her
    father was still awaiting surgery.  The Judge stated therefore that the
    appellant met the requirements of Rules.

5.   The  Secretary  of  State  appealed  pointing  to  the  fact  that  the
    determination had stated that no up-to-date  medical  report  had  been
    supplied and the judge had accepted oral evidence of the appellant that
    he was still awaiting surgery in considering that the appellant had met
    the requirements of the Rules.

6.   At the hearing of the  appeal  before  me  Mr  Tufan  referred  to  the
    requirements of paragraph 54(ii) and stated that the evidence which was
    required had simply not been produced.  There was a clear error of law.
     There was in particular no detail of how the further  treatment  would
    be paid for, when it would take place or  indeed  whether  or  not  the
    treatment was private or under the NHS.  He also pointed  to  a  letter
    sent by Mr Francesco Sanguedolce to a Dr Flandrin of  Parkside  Medical
    Centre, Camberwell which stated that:

         "However the patient is in our waiting list since  April  2013  for
         having a laser vaporisation of the prostate which  did  not  happen
         likely because of his legal problems that are going  to  be  sorted
         shortly as he is married with an English woman.  The patient  needs
         to have the operation done as soon as possible as  it  was  planned
         more than one year ago in order to avoid for  him  to  be  bothered
         more by the urethral catheter.  As  soon  as  his  legal  situation
         would be sorted the patient would be called for the operation."

7.   Mr Tufan pointed out that there was no application for leave to  remain
    because the appellant was "married with an English woman" and therefore
    it appeared that the hospital had been misled.

8.   In reply Mr  Ojukotola  stated  that  the  judge  had  relied  on  oral
    evidence which she had accepted.  He pointed out that the appellant had
    been granted indefinite leave to remain in 1967 and that he  had  three
    children who are resident in Britain and his  second  son  here  has  a
    medical condition.  The appellant's wife  is  also  settled  here.   He
    referred to the appellant's pension here but confirmed it  was  correct
    that the appellant was not applying for residence.  He had  come  as  a
    visitor to attend to the graduation ceremony of his  daughter  and  had
    then been diagnosed and had been treated as a private patient  and  had
    made payments for the treatment he had received under the payment  plan
    which had now been completed - a total of �1,687 having been paid.   He
    said that no amount had been agreed  regarding  the  further  treatment
    which the appellant required.   While  he  accepted  that  the  medical
    report before the judge was not up-to-date  he  stated  that  what  was
    relevant was that there was a medical report.  Moreover the appellant's
    daughter who had a PhD in Medical Sciences had  been  asked  about  her
    father's treatment and had undertaken to ensure that his costs would be
    met.  He referred to the three letters dated 18 March, 4 April  and  27
    June 2013 before the judge and stated it was not the  case  that  there
    was no medical evidence before her.  He stated that the  appellant  had
    returned to Nigeria in 1974 but because of the work which he  had  done
    here received a pension.  He referred to a  pending  surgery  agreement
    and stated that the appellant's costs would be met as his costs in  the
    past had been met.  He therefore asked me to dismiss  the  respondent's
    appeal.

Discussion

9.   The  Immigration  Rules  are  quite  clear.   They  require  up-to-date
    medical evidence, evidence that the  applicant  would  receive  private
    treatment and that the applicant can pay for that treatment.  There was
    simply no evidence before the judge that the  appellant  would  receive
    private treatment, when that treatment would  take  place  and  how  it
    would be paid for.  The appellant's daughter's bank statements  are  in
    the file but these show net salary of approximately �1,630  per  month.
    There is no indication how, from that  sum,  the  appellant's  daughter
    would be able to pay for medical treatment let alone,  of  course,  the
    fact that there is no indication of what  the  costs  of  the  required
    "photoselective vaporisation of  the  prostate"  should  cost  if  that
    indeed is the only surgery which is required.

10.  The judge clearly erred in law by not considering the  requirements  of
    the Rules and in, apparently, concluding that  those  requirements  had
    been met.  There was simply no evidence on which she could  have  based
    her conclusion.  I therefore set aside her decision.

11.  In re-making the decision and for the  same  reasons   -  the  lack  of
    evidence that  the requirements of the rules can be met,  I  find  that
    this appeal cannot succeed.  There are lacunae in  the  evidence  which
    cannot be met by oral evidence regarding  the  lack  of  an  up-to-date
    report of the medical treatment which the appellant requires, the costs
    of that treatment, when it will take place and how the  costs  will  be
    met. The fact that the payment for  the  initial  procedure  which  the
    appellant has now been paid in full (six instalments of �100 per month)
    is not sufficient indication that the appellant would be  able  to  pay
    for any other, and probably more expensive, treatment.

12.  I would add that the initial letter of application  appeared  to  raise
    the issue of the appellant  being  treated  as  a  returning  resident.
    Clearly that could not succeed given that the appellant has been out of
    Britain for 40 years.  It was also argued that he should be a carer for
    his son but again there was no evidence that he  is  playing  any  such
    role.

13.  For the above reasons I, having set aside the decision of the Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal re-make the decision and dismiss this appeal.
