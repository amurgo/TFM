For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas,  Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1.  This is an appeal against a  decision  and  reasons  by  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Majid promulgated on  16th  July  2015  in  which  he
       dismissed an appeal against a decision  made  by  the  Secretary  of
       State on 27th October 2014 refusing the appellant's application  for
       leave to remain in the UK.


    2. The appellant entered the UK on 11th January 2008.  On  30th  August
       2012 she was granted limited leave to remain in the  UK  until  30th
       August 2014 as a Tier 1 Post Study Worker.  On 30th August 2014  the
       appellant applied for leave to remain in the UK on the basis of  her
       private life.  The application was refused for the reasons  set  out
       in the respondent's decision of 27th October 2014 and that gave rise
       to the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.


    3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge noted that he was bound to  take  into
       account the changes introduced to the Immigration Rules  as  of  9th
       July 2012, which materially changed the consideration of  Article  8
       claims.  The Judge found at paragraphs [16] and [17] of his decision
       that having considered the oral and documentary evidence relied upon
       by the appellant in light of the requirements set  out  in  the  new
       rules,  he  was  not  satisfied  that  the   appellant   meets   the
       requirements of the rules.


    4. The appellant advances a single ground  of  appeal.   That  is,  the
       Judge made a material misdirection of law in that the Judge did  not
       properly consider the public  interest  considerations  set  out  in
       s117B Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   The  appellant
       submits that the Judge failed to have any regard to the factors  set
       out in s117B that weigh positively in favour of the appellant.   For
       example, the appellant is able to speak English and the appellant is
       entirely financially independent.   The appellant submits that these
       are factors that go to the core of the  proportionality  assessment,
       but were not considered by the Judge.


    5. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Colyer  on
       2nd November 2015 noting that it is arguable that the Judge erred in
       failing to have due regard to  public  interest  considerations  and
       especially the factors mentioned in s117B  which  may  have  weighed
       positively in her favour in a proportionality assessment.


    6. The matter comes before me to consider whether or not  the  decision
       of First-tier Tribunal Judge Majid involved the making of a material
       error of law, and if the decision  is  set  aside,  to  re-make  the
       decision.


    7. At the hearing before me,  Mr  Adisa  on  behalf  of  the  appellant
       adopted the ground of appeal. He conceded that the appellant  cannot
       succeed  in  her  application  under  paragraph  276ADE(1)  of   the
       Immigration Rules, but he submits that when considering whether  the
       public interest is served by removal of the appellant from  the  UK,
       the Judge should have had regard  to  all  of  the  public  interest
       considerations that are now set out in s117B of the  2002  Act.   Mr
       Adisa relies upon the decision of the Upper Tribunal in  Forman  -v-
       SSHD [2015] UKUT 00412 (IAC) and submits it was incumbent  upon  the
       Judge to consider the public interest considerations  that  are  now
       expressly set out in s117B.


    8. A written response was submitted on behalf of the  respondent  under
       Rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.   The
       respondent  opposes  the  appellant's  appeal  and  in  summary  the
       respondent  submits  that  the   Judge   gave   due   and   relevant
       consideration to all relevant factors such  as  the  fact  that  the
       appellant has not  been  a  financial  burden  on  the  state.   The
       respondent contends that the  appeal  amounts  to  no  more  than  a
       disagreement with the adverse outcome of the  appeal.   It  is  said
       that the Judge considered all the evidence  that  was  available  to
       him, and came to a conclusion that was properly open to him based on
       that evidence.


    9. At the hearing before me, Mr Kotas submits that the decision of  the
       Upper  Tribunal  in  AM  (s  117B)  Malawi  [2015]  UKUT  260  (IAC)
       establishes that the statutory duty to consider the matters set  out
       in s 117B of the 2002 Act is satisfied if  the  Tribunal's  decision
       shows that it has had regard to such parts of it  as  are  relevant.
       In any event, an appellant can obtain no positive right to  a  grant
       of leave to remain from either sll7B (2) or (3), whatever the degree
       of his  fluency  in  English,  or  the  strength  of  his  financial
       resources.


 Discussion


   10. In Singh & Khalid -v-  SSHD  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  74,  (principally  a
       decision about which rules  applied)  Underhill  LJ  summarised  the
       position vis-ï¿½-vis an Article 8  claim  in  circumstances  where  an
       application does not succeed under the rules, generally as follows:-


           "It is now settled that the right course in  any  case  where  an
           applicant relies on his or her  private  or  family  life  is  to
           proceed by considering first  whether  leave  should  be  granted
           under the relevant provisions of the new Rules and  only  if  the
           answer is no to go on to consider article 8  in  its  unvarnished
           form (the so-called "two-stage approach"): see the line of  cases
           which includes Izuazu (Article 8 -  new  rules)  [2013]  UKUT  45
           (IAC) and R (Nagre) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
           [2013] EWHC 7200 (Admin) to which I will have to refer more fully
           below. Thus article  8  claims  "outside  the  Rules"  are  still
           possible, though the scope for their operation is reduced."


   11. At paragraph 66(2) of his judgment,  Underhill  LJ  stated  "If  the
       decision-maker's view is straightforwardly that all  the  Article  8
       issues raised have been addressed in determining the claim under the
       Rules, all that is necessary is, as Sales J says, to say so."


   12. The appeal before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Majid  was  dismissed
       because First-tier Tribunal Judge Majid was not satisfied  that  the
       appellant  had  established  that  she  meets  the  requirements  of
       paragraph 276ADE(1) of the Immigration Rules.  He found at paragraph
       [10(c)] of his decision that the appellant has all her key family in
       Trinidad & Tobago.  Unsurprisingly, he was not  persuaded  that  the
       appellant can therefore satisfy the requirement of  the  immigration
       rules  that  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
       appellant's integration into Trinidad & Tobago if she were  required
       to leave the UK.


   13. The Judge does not expressly state in  his  decision  that  all  the
       Article 8 issues raised, have  been  addressed  in  determining  the
       claim under the Rules.  To  the  extent  that  the  Judge  erred  in
       failing to set that out in his decision, in my judgement  that  does
       not amount to an error of law  that  is  capable  of  affecting  the
       outcome of the appeal.  There  was  simply  nothing  else  that  was
       advanced  by  the  appellant  that  needed  to  be  addressed  in  a
       conventional  assessment  of  her  Article  8  claim   outside   the
       immigration  rules.    In  the  circumstances,  the  Judge  was  not
       concerned with an assessment of proportionality in the same way that
       is required when an  appeal  is  considered  on  Article  8  grounds
       outside the rules.


   14. In any event, I reject the submission made by  Mr.  Adisa  that  the
       Judge  failed  to  have  proper  regard  to  the   public   interest
       considerations set  out  in  s117B  that  weigh  in  favour  of  the
       appellant. As the panel of the Upper Tribunal held  in  AM   (s117B)
       Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC), an appellant can  obtain  no  positive
       right to a grant of leave to remain from either s117B  (2)  or  (3),
       whatever the degree of his fluency in English, or  the  strength  of
       his financial resources.  The appellant gains no assistance from the
       decision in Forman (ss  117A-C  considerations)  [2015]  UKUT  00412
       (IAC) in which  it  was  held  that  the  public  interest  in  firm
       immigration control is not  diluted  by  the  consideration  that  a
       person pursuing a claim under Article 8 ECHR has at no time  been  a
       financial burden on the state or is self-sufficient or is likely  to
       remain so indefinitely. The significance of these  factors  is  that
       where they are not present, the public interest is fortified.


   15. In my judgement, the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  does  not
       contain a material error of law capable of affecting the outcome  of
       the appeal and the appeal is dismissed.
