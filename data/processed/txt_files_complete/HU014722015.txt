For the Respondent:    Ms L Kenn, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction

 1. This is the remaking decision in the appeal of Ms Ahobele following  my
    decision, promulgated on 5 July 2018, that the First-tier Tribunal  had
    materially erred in law and that its  decision  should  be  set  aside.
    That error of law decision is annexed, below.

 2. In essence, I concluded that the judge erred in respect of two  issues:
    the first relating to whether there were  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    the Appellant's partner going to live with her on a permanent basis  in
    South Africa; second, that the question of whether in  the  alternative
    the Appellant could be expected to return to  South  Africa  alone  and
    make an entry clearance application (the Chikwamba point) had not  been
    adequately  addressed.   One  relevant  matter  that  I   felt   needed
    additional evidence was whether the Appellant's  partner's  service  in
    the British Army was relevant to one or both of these issues.

 3. To this end I issued a direction  to  the  Appellant  for  any  further
    evidence to be duly submitted.  In the event, a bundle  was  served  on
    the Respondent and filed with the Upper  Tribunal  in  advance  of  the
    resumed hearing.  Much of the evidence contained therein was before the
    First-tier Tribunal. However at pages 13-13A of the bundle there  is  a
    letter dated 9 July 2018 from the partner's Commanding Officer  in  the
    Royal Welsh Regiment, Major Edward  Willcox.   I  will  return  to  the
    significance of this  evidence  below.   In  light  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's conclusions and my error of  law  decision  the  issues  now
    before me are essentially as follows.

      a) Whether there are  insurmountable  obstacles  in  the  way  of  the
         Appellant's partner going to live with her on a permanent basis  in
         South Africa.

      b) If there are whether in any event the Appellant should be  expected
         to return to  South  Africa  alone  and  make  an  entry  clearance
         application to re-join her partner in the United Kingdom.

 4. These issues fall to be assessed under the ambit of Article  8  outside
    the context of the Immigration Rules.  This is because as at  the  date
    of the human rights claim (that being 8 April 2015) the  Appellant  and
    her partner had not lived together for two  years.   As  a  result  the
    partner could not be considered  a  "partner"  within  the  meaning  of
    GEN.1.2 of Appendix FM to the Rules.  On that basis alone the Appellant
    could not, and cannot, succeed with reference to the  Rules  themselves
    (insofar as satisfaction thereof would be determinative of the  Article
    8 claim).

The evidence now before me

 5. In addition  to  the  new  bundle  mentioned  previously,  I  have  the
    Respondent's bundle and the  bundle  that  was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Both the Appellant and her partner attended the hearing  but
    neither were called to give evidence.

Submissions

For the Appellant

 6. Ms Allen made the following points.  There were no  suitability  issues
    in this case. Whilst the partner was not a "partner" for  the  purposes
    of Appendix FM as at the date of the human rights claim, he was  as  at
    the time of the First-tier Tribunal hearing and remains so  now.   This
    was a  long-term  relationship,  with  cohabitation  since  2015.   The
    partner was a serving soldier in the British Army.   In  light  of  the
    clear findings of the First-tier Tribunal judge and the evidence  as  a
    whole, all of the relevant requirements  under  Appendix  FM  could  be
    satisfied save for the Appellant's own immigration status.

 7. On the issue of insurmountable obstacles, Ms Allen  relied  heavily  on
    the fact of  the  partner's  army  service.   For  him  to  follow  the
    Appellant to South Africa would entail him leaving the army.  In  light
    of the letter from Major Willcox there  would  be  a  year-long  notice
    period. Although a waiver of some of this time was a possibility, there
    was no guarantee of this.  In addition, Ms Allen submitted  that  there
    would be a significant impact on the British Army if the  partner  left
    his service.  He had  a  specialist  role  in  his  battalion  and  his
    departure would have an adverse impact both on  the  army  and  on  the
    taxpayer who would have to pay for the recruitment  and  retraining  of
    somebody else.  In that sense the impact of  leaving  would  go  beyond
    that on the partner himself.

 8. In respect of the Chikwamba point, Ms Allen  submitted  there  were  no
    sensible reasons to expect the Appellant to  pursue  this  route.   The
    only gap in the satisfaction  of  the  Rules  is  now  the  Appellant's
    immigration status.  In terms of the public interest,  the  point  made
    about the British Army was relevant here as well.

For the Respondent

 9. Ms Kenny submitted that the partner did not hold a particularly  senior
    rank in the army.  His position was not  comparable  to  that  of,  for
    example, an A&E consultant: he was more akin to a  junior  doctor  with
    some specialist skills.  She  submitted  that  there  would  not  be  a
    serious  impact  on  the  army  as  a  whole.   There  would   not   be
    insurmountable obstacles to the partner going to live in  South  Africa
    with the Appellant.  There had been separation of  the  couple  in  the
    past when the partner had been overseas as part of  his  service.   The
    public interest in  this  case  was  strong  and  counted  against  the
    Appellant  because  of  her  immigration  history.   It  would  not  be
    disproportionate to expect the Appellant to go back to South Africa and
    make an entry clearance application if indeed there were insurmountable
    obstacles to her partner going to reside there on a permanent basis.

The Appellant's reply

10. In reply, Ms Allen emphasised the fact that the Appellant had  in  fact
    had leave to remain in the United Kingdom between 2002 and 2005 and had
    maintained contact with the Respondent thereafter.  She reiterated  the
    importance of the partner's role in the army.

11. At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision.

Relevant findings of fact

12. Based on the favourable findings made by the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    the Respondent's position on the evidence in the hearing before  me,  I
    make the following findings.

13. I have no hesitation in finding  that  the  Appellant  has  been  in  a
    genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  her  partner,  a  British
    citizen, since 2012 and that they have cohabited since  2015.   I  find
    that the Appellant herself is a qualified dental nurse but has not been
    allowed to practice as such due to her precarious  immigration  status.
    I find that the Appellant did have leave in this country  between  2002
    and 2005, as shown by the relevant evidence before  me,  and  that  she
    made at least two applications to the Respondent prior to the latest in
    2015.  To that extent there is no question that she hid  herself  away,
    used aliases,  or  in  some  other  way  aggravated  the  fact  of  her
    overstaying.

14. Turning to the Appellant's partner I find that he has  been  a  serving
    member of the British Army since the beginning of 2011.   There  is  no
    doubt that he has an exemplary service record and that  having  already
    served for a considerable period of time  he  intends  to  continue  to
    serve the United Kingdom beyond the expiry of  his  current  period  of
    engagement, that being 2023.  I find that the partner holds the rank of
    Lance Corporal in his regiment.

15. Based on his own unchallenged evidence and the  important  letter  from
    Major  Willcox,  I  find  that  the  partner  has  acquired  particular
    specialist skills in the field of logistics and driving  qualifications
    over the course of time. I accept the clear evidence from Major Willcox
    that the impact on his particular sub-unit's structure would  be  "very
    significant".  I draw what I consider  to  be  a  perfectly  reasonable
    inference from this that recruiting and training a suitable replacement
    would have considerable resource  implications.   Even  if  Ms  Kenny's
    comparison with the partner's role to that  of  a  junior  doctor  with
    specialist expertise were accurate (of which I have some doubts), it is
    very clear that a great deal of time, effort and expense will have gone
    into bringing the partner to the standard at which he  now  stands,  in
    the same way that a junior doctor goes through many years of specialist
    and expensive training (not to mention additional specific expertise in
    a narrow field of medicine, for example)  before  reaching  a  suitably
    qualified and experience level.

16. I find that if the partner did wish to leave his  service  voluntarily,
    which is a possibility insofar as the army rules are  concerned,  there
    would be a year-long notice period.  I accept that the  possibility  of
    waiving part of that period exists, but there is no evidence before  me
    to indicate that such a waiver is guaranteed or, if one is agreed,  how
    much time off the period would result from this.

17. I find that the partner's earnings are, and always have been, more than
    sufficient to meet the minimum income threshold under  Appendix  FM.  I
    find that the Appellant speaks perfectly good English.

Conclusions

18. As mentioned  previously  the  Appellant  cannot  satisfy  all  of  the
    requirements of the Rules.  Primarily this is because her partner could
    not have been considered a "partner" for the purposes  of  Appendix  FM
    because the period of cohabitation had not been for at least two  years
    prior to the date of the human  rights  claim  in  April  2015.    This
    conclusion is not of course the end of the matter.

19. I go on to consider Article 8 outside the context of the Rules, bearing
    in  mind  their  obvious  significance  and  also  the  need  for   the
    Respondent's decision to strike a fair balance between the  Appellant's
    rights on the one hand and the public interest on the other.

20. There is quite clearly a family  life  in  this  case  as  between  the
    Appellant and her partner.  They have been in a  relationship  now  for
    many years and have been cohabiting for the past three.

21.  The  Respondent's  decision   constitutes   a   sufficiently   serious
    interference so as to engage Article 8.

22. There is no issue as to the decision under appeal being  in  accordance
    with the law and that it pursues a legitimate aim.

23. So to proportionality. I have taken full account of section 117B of the
    NIAA 2002 and relevant case-law, including Agyarko [2017] UKSC  11  and
    TZ (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109.

24. The following factors weigh in  the  Respondent's  favour.  The  public
    interest is of course a significant factor in its own  right,  and  the
    maintenance of effective immigration control is certainly  in  play  in
    this appeal (although so too is another aspect of the public  interest,
    see below).  The Appellant's unlawful  status  in  the  United  Kingdom
    since 2005 and her inability to meet the Rules (specifically because of
    the "partner" issue) also count against her:  both  carry  considerable
    weight.

25. On the other side of the balance sheet rest factors favourable  to  the
    Appellant. As of now, the Appellant does meet all  of  the  substantive
    requirements of the Rules save for  the  immigration  status  criterion
    under E-LTRP.2.2(b) of Appendix FM (I note here that the Respondent has
    never suggested that the evidential requirements under  Appendix  FM-SE
    could not be met. Given the nature  of  the  partner's  "employer",  it
    would be close to perverse to have raised any objection).

26. The partner's army service is very important  and  I  shall  return  to
    this, below.

Evaluative judgment on proportionality

27. It is necessary to consider the question of "insurmountable  obstacles"
    (see paragraphs 30 and 34 of  TZ  (Pakistan)).  I  conclude  that  such
    obstacles do not exist in this case, albeit this is by a narrow margin.
     Having to leave the army would clearly be a  very  difficult  decision
    for the partner to take: he would be giving up his career. I take  into
    account  the  fact  that  he  would  be  leaving  the  country  of  his
    nationality. Although the partner has previously raised a fear of going
    to South Africa because of potentially being singled out  as  a  former
    British soldier. This point has not been pursued before me. I  conclude
    that there would not be a risk to the partner. A final  matter  is  the
    notice period. I have accepted that it is a year's  duration.  However,
    there is a strong possibility that  some  of  it  would  be  waived.  I
    appreciate  that  this  is  not  guaranteed,  but  I  am   looking   at
    probabilities, not certainties. Further, there is merit to  Ms  Kenny's
    submission that the Appellant and her partner have been  separated  for
    fairly significant periods in the past because  of  the  latter's  army
    service. Whilst the circumstances  of  a  separation  during  a  notice
    period would not be entirely the same, this factor would  not,  in  all
    the circumstances, represent a very significant difficulty.

28. Thus, on an approach focused solely upon the individuals concerned,  as
    I read EX.1 of Appendix FM to require, the obstacles that clearly would
    face this couple cannot be said  to  be  "insurmountable",  even  on  a
    cumulative basis.

29. This conclusion goes to inform  my  assessment  of  whether  there  are
    exceptional circumstances in this case. The absence  of  insurmountable
    obstacles means that the considerable weight attributable to the public
    interest in  maintaining  immigration  control  is  not  diminished  by
    reference to the Rules.

30. Having said that, I have concluded that this is a case in  which  there
    are exceptional circumstances. These relate squarely to  the  partner's
    service with the British Army.

31. As I mentioned during the hearing, it seems to  me  as  though  another
    facet of the public interest is the defence of the United  Kingdom  and
    the wellbeing, as it were, of  its  armed  forces.  It  would  be  very
    difficult for the Respondent to suggest that the ordinary woman and man
    "in the street" (or indeed on the  modern  equivalent  of  the  Clapham
    Omnibus) would disagree with that proposition.

32. Here, a British national serving soldier with particular expertise  and
    someone who is quite clearly extremely valued by  his  unit,  would  be
    forced to leave his post to the serious  detriment  to  the  army.  His
    service has involved him  acquiring  particular  expertise  within  the
    context of his unit, skills that if lost would,  in  the  view  of  his
    Commanding Officer have a "very significant" impact.  In this sense the
    consequences of leaving the United  Kingdom  relate  not  only  to  the
    partner himself, but to the British Army as well.  Whilst  it  is  true
    that the partner does not hold a senior rank or  have  responsibilities
    of a wider nature, it is in my view the case that each  particular  nut
    and bolt of the army goes to ensure that the  whole  machine  works  as
    well as possible.

33. This is a factor which can, and in my view does, weigh very heavily  in
    the Appellant's favour. Indeed, it represents an  exceptional  or  very
    compelling circumstances, notwithstanding the absence of insurmountable
    obstacles in respect of the partner as, I stress, an individual.

34. In my  view  the  Respondent  has  failed  to  appreciate  the  overall
    significance of the partner's role in the service of this country. In a
    sense, one aspect of the public interest has not been tallied  up  with
    another.

35. Finally, I to the Chikwamba point. I bear in mind the issue of  whether
    there is a sensible reason here for the Appellant to go back  to  South
    Africa alone and apply for entry clearance  in  order  to  re-join  her
    partner in the United Kingdom.  In light of all the circumstances I can
    see no such reason.  All of the substantive requirements of Appendix FM
    are now met, save for  the  obstacle  of  the  Appellant's  immigration
    status.  In my view an entry clearance application would be certain (if
    not certain, very close to it) to succeed if made.

36. Taking into account everything discussed above, I conclude that this is
    a case involving circumstances sufficiently  exceptional  to  raise  it
    well above and beyond a "standard" Article 8 claim.  On  this  basis  I
    conclude that the Respondent's decision does not strike a fair  balance
    and that this is one of the rare cases in which an appeal on Article  8
    grounds outside the context of the Rules.




Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

I re-make the decision by determining that the Respondent's refusal  of  the
Appellant's human rights claim is unlawful under  section  6  of  the  Human
Rights Act 1998, with reference to Article 8 ECHR.

The appeal is therefore allowed.



No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make a reduced  fee
award  of  �70.00.  Although  the  Appellant  has  succeeded,  the  material
evidence  from  the  partner's  Commanding  Officer  only   came   late   in
proceedings.

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms F Allen, Counsel, instructed by Paul John & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is a challenge by the Appellant against the decision of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Seelhoff (the judge), promulgated on 16 March  2018,  by
    which he dismissed her appeal against the Respondent's refusal  of  her
    human rights claim, dated 8 June 2015.  This appeal has  a  history  to
    it, having initially been  dismissed  by  another  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  back  in  October  2016.   A  challenge  to  that  decision  was
    successful and by a decision dated 5 June 2017 a Deputy Upper  Tribunal
    Judge found there to be errors of  law,  set  the  decision  aside  and
    remitted it back to the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. In essence, the Appellant's case is and always  has  been  as  follows.
    She is in a genuine relationship with a serving member of  the  British
    Army.  Although she has been a long-term overstayer in this country she
    asserted that she should be granted leave to remain on the basis of her
    relationship and that her partner could not be expected to go and  live
    with her in South Africa, nor that she should be expected to go back to
    that country and make an entry clearance application.

The judge's decision

 3. At [28] the judge accepts that the Appellant was indeed  in  a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship with her  partner.   When  considering  the
    Article 8 claim in the context of the Rules  the  judge  quite  rightly
    found that the period of cohabitation immediately preceding the  making
    of the human rights claim in April 2015 had  not  exceeded  two  years.
    Therefore, her partner could not be considered a "partner"  within  the
    meaning of GEN.1.2(iv) of Appendix FM to the Rules,  (see  [30]).   The
    judge then goes on to consider the matter outside of the context of the
    Rules.  He finds that the couple had in fact been cohabiting since  May
    2015.  In considering whether there were  insurmountable  obstacles  in
    the path of the partner going back with the Appellant to live in  South
    Africa the judge rejects the suggestion that he would face any problems
    as a result of him having gained his British  nationality  and  thereby
    losing his original South  African  nationality.   Later  in  the  same
    paragraph the judge says the following:

         "I accept that the Sponsor would have to give up his job  with  the
         British Army in order to return to  South  African  live  with  his
         partner but this cannot be said to be  an  insurmountable  obstacle
         rather it is a very significant inconvenience and would breach  his
         army contract but that is not enough to reach the threshold."

 4. The judge then looks at  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  and  concludes  that
    there would be no very significant obstacles to the  Appellant  herself
    reintegrating into South African life.

 5. The judge turns to the issue of proportionality.  He finds  that  there
    were no suitability  issues  in  the  case  and  that  the  eligibility
    requirements of the Rules would be  satisfied  if  an  entry  clearance
    application were made.  He then goes on to find that the  couple  could
    "easily meet the income requirements" given that the  partner's  salary
    was well in  excess  of  the  �18,600  required  by  Appendix  FM.   In
    considering Section 117B of the NIAA 2002 the judge states that he  was
    attaching "minimal" weight to  the  private  and  family  life  of  the
    Appellant given that her time in this country had been as an overstayer
    for many years.  The judge took  the  view  that  the  Appellant  could
    return to South  Africa  and  apply  for  entry  clearance.   This,  he
    concluded,  would  have  "minimal  practical  consequences"   for   the
    Appellant's family life with her partner.  On this basis the appeal was
    dismissed.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 6. For the purposes of the appeal before me it is only  really  grounds  1
    and 2 that have any relevance.  The first ground asserts that the judge
    failed to deal adequately or at all with  the  Chikwamba  issue  before
    him, namely that there was no good  reason  why  the  Appellant  should
    return to South Africa to make an  entry  clearance  application  given
    that on the judge's findings she  would  satisfy  the  relevant  Rules.
    Reference is made to paragraph 51 of Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11.

 7. Ground 2 challenges the judge's approach to the issue of insurmountable
    obstacles outside the context of the Immigration Rules.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Osborne
    by a decision dated 25 April 2018.  He comments that  it  was  arguable
    that the judge had applied the "wrong test" to the  established  family
    life of the Appellant.

The hearing before me

 9. Ms Allen dealt with ground 2 first.  With  reference  to  [33]  of  the
    judge's decision she  submitted  that  by  adopting  the  phrase  "very
    significant inconvenience", he had seemingly conflated the test of very
    significant difficulties with whether there would be  an  inconvenience
    only.  It was difficult to discern, she submitted, what  threshold  the
    judge had in fact applied.  She also raised the issue  of  the  judge's
    finding that the partner's relocation to South Africa would breach  his
    army contract.  It was unclear what the judge meant by this  precisely,
    and there was no evidence to indicate what  the  consequences  of  this
    breach might be.  It appeared as though the judge had taken this  point
    for himself.  Given that he had done this, he  had  failed  to  explain
    what such a breach would entail for a serving British soldier.

10. Moving on to ground 1 and the Chikwamba issue, Ms Allen relied  on  the
    judge's findings as to  the  ability  of  the  Appellant  to  meet  the
    relevant Immigration Rules should an  entry  clearance  application  be
    made now (strictly speaking, as at the date of the hearing  before  the
    judge).  She submitted that once the judge had  made  these  favourable
    findings, the ability to meet the Rules must have a direct  bearing  on
    the weight attributable to the family life.  She  referred  me  to  the
    decisions in Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803, Agyarko, and  TZ  (Pakistan)
    [2018] EWCA Civ 1109 and to paragraph 3 of  the  grant  of  permission.
    The judge had failed to factor in this point when assessing the  weight
    to be attached to the family life when concluding that that weight  was
    "minimal" (see [37]).  In addition, Ms Allen submitted that  given  the
    favourable  findings  in  relation  to  a  putative   entry   clearance
    application, the judge had failed to explain why there was any sensible
    reason for requiring  the  Appellant  to  go  back  and  make  such  an
    application.

11. Ms Isherwood emphasised  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  had  been  an
    overstayer since 2005.  She submitted  that  the  judge's  use  of  the
    phrase "very significant inconvenience" was not a material error.   She
    accepted that the judge had made favourable findings in  respect  of  a
    possible entry clearance application and its prospects of success.

Decision on error of law

12. As I announced to the parties at the hearing, I conclude that there are
    material errors of law in the judge's decision.

13. Beginning with the  Chikwamba  point,  I  do  note  that  there  is  no
    reference in the judge's decision to any of the relevant cases  dealing
    with this point.  That of course is not fatal and does not  necessarily
    disclose an error of law, but it is perhaps unfortunate.  In any  event
    I agree with Ms Allen's submission that once the  judge  had  made  the
    favourable finding in  respect  of  satisfaction  of  the  Rules  in  a
    hypothetical entry clearance application, he should then have  factored
    this into the subsequent conclusions in the following ways.

14. First, when assessing the weight attributable to the Appellant's family
    life in the United Kingdom, the fact that she would be able to meet the
    requirements of the Rules was a relevant consideration (see for example
    paragraphs 28-34 of TZ, and 51 of Agyarko).  We know from Rhuppiah that
    the usual reduction in weight in cases of precarious family life is not
    a fixity: the ability of an individual to show that they could meet the
    relevant requirements of the Rules as at the date of hearing  would  be
    at least a relevant factor  when  considering  what  weight  should  be
    attached to that family life.

15. Second, if, as the judge has found, it is said that the Appellant could
    meet all the relevant requirements of the Rules, at  least  as  at  the
    date of hearing, it seems to me as though the Chikwamba point has  then
    to be addressed.  It is true that the threshold may be fairly demanding
    in respect of the  need  to  show  that  a  potential  entry  clearance
    application would stand a very strong  (if  not  certain)  prospect  of
    success if made (see paragraph 51 of Agyarko and paragraph 45  of  Kaur
    [2018] EWCA Civ 1413).  This would not be decisive, but  it  does  call
    for adequate consideration.  In my view the judge has failed to  engage
    with the issue that was  live  given  what  he  had  already  found  in
    relation to the ability of the Appellant to meet the relevant Rules.

16. I turn to the  insurmountable  obstacles  issue.   With  hesitation,  I
    conclude that there is a material error of law here as well.  With  due
    respect to the judge it is unfortunate that he has  employed  a  rather
    confusing phrase in [33], namely "very significant  inconvenience".   I
    have of course endeavoured to read  the  phrase  sensibly  and  in  the
    context of the decision as a whole.  However, the fact remains that  on
    the one hand inconvenience, even very serious inconvenience,  will  not
    be enough to show the existence of insurmountable  obstacles.   On  the
    other hand, very  significant  difficulties  would  meet  the  relevant
    threshold.  Here, the judge has conflated the two, leaving  the  reader
    unclear as to what test has in  fact  been  applied.   Whilst  I  would
    readily accept that the South African nationality issue was not capable
    of amounting to an insurmountable obstacle, it is less clear  the  same
    would apply to a serving British soldier having to "give  up  his  job"
    and then breach an army contract by relocating.  On  the  face  of  it,
    such an eventuality could be viewed as really very significant  indeed.
    In short, the overall assessment lacks clarity.

17. In light of the above I set the judge's decision aside.

Disposal

18. I appreciate that this appeal has already been remitted once and  I  do
    not propose to follow a similar course.  This matter will  be  retained
    in the Upper Tribunal.  In the usual course  of  events  I  would  have
    expected to go on and remake the decision on the  evidence  before  me.
    However, the issue of a possible breach of the  army  contract  by  the
    partner if he were to go and live  in  South  Africa  requires  further
    evidence.  It is unfortunate that the Appellant's representatives  have
    failed to adduce this evidence at this stage, but it is  of  importance
    to this case and I am willing to  adjourn  the  appeal  for  a  resumed
    hearing before me in due course in  order  that  relevant,  and  clear,
    evidence can be provided.  Ms Isherwood did not  object  to  this.   To
    this end, I will issue directions, below.




Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law  and
I set it aside.

I adjourn this appeal for a resumed hearing before me in due course.



Directions to the parties

 1. The Appellant shall file with the  Upper  Tribunal  and  serve  on  the
    Respondent a consolidated  bundle  of  evidence  relied  on,  including
    evidence relating to  the  partner's  service  in  the  army,  and  the
    consequences of any breach of his contract  of  service.   This  bundle
    shall be filed and served no later than  21  days  before  the  resumed
    hearing.

No anonymity direction is made.
