For the Respondent:    Ms Khan of Counsel, instructed by Levi Solicitors
LLP


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Hindson made following a hearing at Bradford on 14th October 2014.

Background

 2. There is a complex history to this matter.  The appellant came  to  the
    UK with his wife and children in 2003, originally  as  a  visitor,  and
    subsequently overstayed.  One of his children,  [MR],  married  an  EEA
    national.  The claimant and other family members applied to  remain  as
    her family members.

 3. [MR's] application was originally  refused  because  the  Secretary  of
    State was not satisfied that the marriage was not one  of  convenience.
    However in a  decision  promulgated  in  September  2012  Judge  Howard
    allowed the appeal, because he was satisfied that the marriage was  not
    one of convenience. However, he dismissed the appeals  of  the  present
    claimant and other family members on  the  grounds  that  they  had  to
    satisfy Regulation 8(2) of the EEA Regulations.

 4. The claimant appealed against that decision and, on 25th March 2013 the
    then President of the Tribunal, the Hon. Mr Justice Blake sitting  with
    myself set aside Judge Howard's decision  and  re-made  the  appeal  by
    directing that, on the basis of the First-tier Judge's conclusions they
    were family members who were dependent on an EEA qualified person.

 5. Subsequently residence cards were issued.  However, on 8th April  2014,
    on the claimant's return to the UK following a visit to Pakistan, as  a
    consequence of the answers he gave in the course of  his  interview  on
    arrival, his residence card was revoked and he was  refused  permission
    to enter.  It was the appeal against that decision  which  came  before
    Judge Hindson.

 6. Judge Hindson  recorded  that,  whether  [MR's]  marriage  was  one  of
    convenience or not had been previously  determined  in  his  favour  by
    Judge Howard.

 7. The judge said that in a letter dated 12th August 2014 the Secretary of
    State indicated that information had subsequently come to light showing
    that the EEA national and her husband  had  never  lived  at  the  same
    address and that no evidence had been provided that  she  was  in  fact
    exercising Treaty rights and was therefore a qualified person.

 8. He considered the evidence provided by the Secretary of State. He noted
    that the EEA national was said to  have  been  having  an  affair  with
    another  man  and  she  was  pregnant   with   someone   from   another
    relationship.  He said it was unfortunate that she had not attended  to
    give evidence but hardly surprising in the circumstances.  The evidence
    of the Register of Electors could have been put before Judge Howard but
    was not.  He accepted that the claimant had not deliberately hidden the
    breakdown of the  relationship  from  the  Secretary  of  State.  Ample
    evidence of cohabitation had been provided.   He  gave  weight  to  her
    written evidence, and to the witnesses called on the claimant's behalf.
     He said that he had carefully considered all of the evidence and could
    find no reason for coming to a different conclusion than Judge  Howard.



 9. So far as the second  issue  was  concerned,  namely  whether  the  EEA
    national was a qualified person, he wrote as follows:

         "The respondent also contends  that  [AK]  is  unemployed  and  not
         exercising Treaty Rights.  I have been provided with evidence  that
         she has been working, in the form of payslips, and a record of  her
         PAYE provided by HMRC.  The  most  recent  evidence  of  employment
         relates to October 2013 (payslips).   [AK's]  bank  statements  for
         early 2014 show her to be in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance.   She
         makes no mention of her current employment status  in  her  witness
         statement."

10. He then cited the relevant Regulations and concluded as follows:

         "I have been provided with no evidence that [AK]  is  currently  in
         employment.  Indeed Miss Khan relied on the provisions that  relate
         to jobseekers.  The fact that she is in receipt  of  JSA  indicates
         that the DWP is satisfied that she is seeking work.  The fact  that
         she had been able to obtain work over the four years prior  to  her
         pregnancy indicates that she has a genuine chance of being engaged.
          I am therefore satisfied that [AK] is a qualified person by virtue
         of being a jobseeker."

The grounds of application

11. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on three grounds.

12. First, the judge refused to allow cross-examination of the claimant  or
    any of the witnesses in relation to  their  immigration  history.   The
    Presenting Officer had strongly protested  to  his  course  of  action.
    Since additional evidence had come to light since the determination  in
    2012, the Immigration Judge was wrong not to allow further  questioning
    on matters of credibility. Furthermore the judge erred by allowing  ten
    unadopted witness statements into evidence and placed reliance on their
    contents when reaching his decision even though the EEA national failed
    to attend the hearing along with nine of the  authors.   She  had  also
    failed on two  occasions  to  attend  interviews  when  called  by  the
    Secretary of State.  Given that the Secretary of State had not had  any
    opportunity  to  question  her,  the  fairness  of  the   hearing   was
    prejudiced.

13. Second the judge had failed to consider whether the EEA national was  a
    qualified person as a jobseeker.  She had been unemployed for a  period
    of at least one year and one month at  the  date  of  the  hearing  and
    therefore failed to retain the status of jobseeker, let  alone  failing
    to provide evidence which could be considered compelling to demonstrate
    that she was continuing to seek employment.

14. Finally, the judge had failed to consider whether the  claimant  was  a
    dependent on the qualified person.  She was no longer in a relationship
    with the claimant's son. She had moved in with her current partner  and
    had given birth to his child.

15. Permission to appeal was granted  by  Designated  Judge  Bird  for  the
    reasons stated in the grounds on 15th January 2015.

Consideration of whether there is an error of law

16. First, Ms Khan strongly argued that Immigration Judge  Hindson  refused
    to allow cross-examination in relation to  the  witnesses'  immigration
    history, rather than the issue of the marriage of convenience, and  the
    Presenting Officer was therefore  going  on  a  fishing  expedition  on
    matters irrelevant to the issue under appeal.   Accordingly  the  judge
    was fully entitled to restrict cross-examination in  the  way  that  he
    did.

17.  The  difficulty  in  preventing  a  representative  conducting  cross-
    examination is that it is not possible to say what the effect  of  that
    cross-examination would have been had it  been  permitted  to  proceed.
    Although it is right to say that the judge did  consider  the  evidence
    provided by the Secretary of State in relation to the marriage, had the
    Presenting Officer been allowed to cross-examine the  claimant  on  his
    immigration history, which is clearly very poor, it is not possible  to
    say  whether  the  judge  might  have   reached   another   conclusion.
    Credibility was clearly a central issue in the appeal and  the  refusal
    to allow the Presenting Officer  to  cross-examine  on  the  claimant's
    conduct was not an irrelevant matter in the context of  the  issues  in
    this appeal.

18. With respect to ground 2, under Regulation 6(2) subject  to  Regulation
    7A(4) and 7B(4) a person who is no longer working shall not cease to be
    treated as a worker for the purpose of paragraph (1)(b) if -

         "(a) He is temporarily unable to work as the result of  an  illness
             or accident;

         (b)  He is in duly recorded involuntary unemployment  after  having
             been employed in the UK for at least one year,  provided  that
             he -

               i) Has registered as a jobseeker with the relevant employment
                  office; and

              ii) Satisfies conditions (a) and (b)."

19. Regulation (6) states that condition (b) is that the person can provide
    evidence that he is seeking employment and  has  a  genuine  chance  of
    being engaged.

20. Regulation 6(7) states that a person may not retain  the  status  of  a
    worker pursuant to paragraph (2)(b) or jobseeker pursuant to  paragraph
    (1)(a) for longer than  the  relevant  period  unless  he  can  provide
    compelling evidence that he is continuing to seek employment and has  a
    genuine chance of being engaged.

21. Regulation 6(8) states that the relevant period means -

         "(a) In the case of a person retaining worker  status  pursuant  to
             paragraph 2(b) a continuous period of six months."

22. In this case there was evidence before the Secretary of State that  the
    EEA national had worked between 2009 and 2012.  Accordingly she  was  a
    person who was a worker and sought to retain that status.  In order  to
    meet the requirements of the Regulations she could only  retain  worker
    status for a continuous period of six months unless she  could  provide
    compelling evidence that she was continuing to seek employment and  had
    a genuine chance of being engaged.

23. The evidence in  the  respondent's  bundle,  from  Inland  Revenue  and
    Customs, was that she had not worked since 22nd  June  2012.   She  had
    however also provided payslips for the period from July 2013 to the end
    of October 2013, together with evidence of her  pregnancy  and  of  the
    birth of a baby in June/July 2014.

24. Ms Khan argued that the claimant had satisfied the requirements of  the
    Regulations by the  production  of  the  wage  slips,  which  had  been
    produced from an employer that she had previously  worked  for.   There
    was evidence that she was pregnant, which is why she had given up work.
    There were a number of reasons why the Inland Revenue records  had  not
    been updated.   Furthermore  the  Secretary  of  State's  own  guidance
    confirmed that a failure to comply  with  tax  and  national  insurance
    regulations did not mean that an EEA national could not  be  considered
    to be a qualified person.

25. Unfortunately none of those matters were considered by the judge in his
    determination.  There was a clear inconsistency in the evidence  before
    him, namely that from  the  Inland  Revenue  which  was  that  the  EEA
    national had not worked since 2012, and payslips which  show  that  she
    had been working in 2013, which he was obliged to resolve and  did  not
    do so.

26. So far as Ground 3 is concerned, Ms Khan submitted that  the  issue  of
    dependency had never been raised by the Secretary of State prior to the
    challenge to the determination but in any event he  was  able  to  show
    that he was a dependant on his son, the spouse of an EEA national which
    would satisfy the requirements of Regulation 7(1)(c).

27. Since the issue was not raised  before  the  judge  he  can  hardly  be
    criticised for not dealing with it.  Nevertheless in order  to  qualify
    for a residence card the claimant  has  to  establish  dependency;  the
    Secretary of State will not  issue  one  where  dependency  is  not  so
    established.  It is clearly therefore in the claimant's  interests  for
    the issue to be resolved.

28. For the above reasons, I am satisfied that  the  judge  erred  in  law.
    Accordingly the decision of Judge Hindson is set aside.

The resumed hearing on 8 September 2015

29. I heard oral evidence from the appellant Abdul Rashid Choudhry, his son
    [MR] and his brother-in-law [MH].  The appellant relied on  the  bundle
    of documents produced  for  the  previous  hearings,  together  with  a
    further bundle of up-to-date witness statements and  evidence  relating
    to the various family's work history.  There  was  also  an  up-to-date
    statement from the EEA national [AK].

30. Mr Diwncyz also produced further documentation,  specifically  evidence
    from HM Revenue and Customs in relation to [AK's] employment from  2009
    to 2015, evidence from her employment at Three  Way  Solutions  Limited
    and documents from the UK Border Agency, specifically  the  immigration
    report from Sarah Gallagher dated 18th January 2012  which  was  before
    Judge Howard and a  document  which  has  come  into  being  since  his
    determination was written, namely a report from Kent Police dated  14th
    December 2012 relating to [AK] who was encountered by them.  It records
    that she was working for an escort agency as at that date and that  she
    told them that she had previously  been  working  for  four  months  in
    London as a sex worker.



The Evidence of the Appellant

31. Mr Choudhry adopted his statement at the commencement of  his  evidence
    and said that it was accurate and correct.

32. At the heart of this case is the issue of whether the  appellant's  son
    [MR] entered into a sham marriage with an EEA national.

33. The family says that [MR] and [AK] met in 2007 in a local  park.   They
    got to know each other and, on 5th September 2009, they  married.   The
    marriage certificate shows that the marriage was  solemnised  according
    to the rights and ceremonies of the Church of England at St  Augustines
    Church in the Metropolitan Borough of  Calderdale.   Mr  Choudhry  said
    that he wanted [MR] and [AK] to  have  an  Islamic  marriage,  but  she
    wanted to marry in the church.  They were not happy with  the  decision
    and refused to attend the church wedding.  Nevertheless  following  the
    wedding they organised a wedding party at the house and  have  accepted
    [AK] as one of the family members.  She used to live with them at 10 [-
    ], Halifax until the couple separated in 2013.  However [AK] also  used
    to regularly spend time at her mother's house,  because  there  were  a
    large number of people in 10 [-].  He became very confused  about  when
    he had last seen [AK] and how much time she had spent  at  their  house
    and how much time she had  spent  with  her  mother.   However  he  did
    finally say that his evidence was that before he went  to  Pakistan  in
    March 2013 [AK] was living with them for most of the time.

34. Miss Khan sought to clarify his evidence during re-examination.  It  is
    the family's case that the couple split up around September to  October
    2013.  However Mr Choudhry was clear that  he  saw  [AK]  on  the  last
    occasion in March 2014 and that prior to that date she was living at 10
    [-].  When it was put to him that he could not  have  seen  [AK]  every
    weekday  until  March  2014   if   the   couple   had   split   up   in
    September/October 2013 he said that he was confused and he did not  see
    her after the separation.  He said that he saw her every day before the
    separation between 2009 and September 2013 but was  unable  to  clarify
    his evidence about the period from September 2013 to March 2014.

35. Mr Choudhry was also asked about where he lived.  In his  statement  he
    said that he and his wife and their  four  children  have  been  living
    together in a four bedroomed  house  belonging  to  his  brother-in-law
    [MH].  He and his wife shared one room, [MH],  his  wife  and  children
    shared another i.e. six people in all in a bedroom, his son [MR] shared
    a room with his wife [AK] and his three remaining children  shared  the
    last bedroom.  He said that [MH] had two daughters, one aged 12  to  13
    and another aged 5 to 6 and a son aged 11 to 12 who all shared  a  room
    together.  [MH's] baby son slept in his parents' room.   [MH]  was  the
    sole owner of the house which he had bought with a mortgage.

36. Mr Choudhry said  that  he  was  not  working  and  did  not  give  any
    contribution towards household expenses although  his  children  worked
    and contributed to the bills and the groceries.  He also said that  his
    son [MR] paid him �50 each week.  He  then  contradicted  his  previous
    evidence and said that he contributed to the groceries.  His two  other
    sons, [HuR] and [HR] also gave him �50 every week or two.

37. When asked about his own finances he said that his  wife  used  to  get
    employment support allowance but  that  had  been  stopped  because  on
    assessment she had  been  told  that  she  could  work.   He  had  been
    registered as a job seeker in the past but had not been registered as a
    job seeker since he went  to  Pakistan  in  2014.   Until  he  went  to
    Pakistan he was receiving job seeker's allowance following registration
    in 2013 after he got his visa.

38. He was asked about [AK's] contribution to the household.  He said  that
    she used to contribute to household bills and with  food  and  clothing
    but not cash and she never gave him any money.  So far as he  knew  she
    never gave [MH] money for living in the house.

Evidence of [MR]

39. [MR] also adopted his witness statement.  He said that he had been able
    to obtain a statement from his former wife in support of  his  father's
    appeal but he had not asked her to  come  to  court  to  give  evidence
    because he knew she would not attend.

40. Mr Diwncyz asked [MR] a number of questions about his  wife.   He  said
    that he had known her for  two  years  before  they  got  married.   Mr
    Diwncyz asked him about her religion.  [MR] did not know what he meant.
     Mr Diwncyz asked him whether she was a Baptist or  an  Anglican  or  a
    Methodist or a Catholic.  [MR] said that she was Catholic  but  he  did
    not know whether she was from the eastern branch or a  Roman  Catholic.
    He was asked why they had therefore married in the  Church  of  England
    and he said that it was up to her and he had agreed.

41. He was also extremely unclear  about  the  dates  in  relation  to  the
    wedding.  He did say  that  there  was  a  gentleman  interpreting  the
    service for him and he spoke Punjabi and Lithuanian.

42. Mr Diwncyz asked [MR] repeatedly about how much contact he had had with
    [AK] following the wedding.  He said that she had never gone away  from
    the Halifax or the Sowerby Bridge area, where her mother lived  and  he
    saw his wife every day.  He confirmed that he physically saw  her  each
    day.

43. The Kent Police report was put to him.  Mr Diwncyz told [MR] that  [AK]
    had not mentioned either her marriage or her address and had  told  the
    police that she had been in the London area working for five months  as
    a sex worker.  [MR] simply said that he had no knowledge in relation to
    this matter.  His wife had told him that she might stay with a  friend.



44. When it was put to him the obvious contradiction in his  evidence  that
    he could not have seen her everyday if she had been working  as  a  sex
    worker in the London area [MR] maintained that he had not been lying to
    the court.

Evidence of [MH]

45. [MH] gave a different account of the family arrangements.  He said that
    he had never had a mortgage and owned the house jointly with his  wife.
    He lived there with his wife and their  children  and  his  brother-in-
    law's children but  Abdul  Choudhry  and  his  wife  slept  at  another
    property, 42 [-], Halifax, which they rented.  It was a three bedroomed
    property.  When asked why Mr Choudhry's children did not live with  him
    in 42 [-] he said that they were very close to his own children and  so
    they stayed with them.

46. So far as the contributions to the household  were  concerned  he  said
    that they were neither regular nor expected and he could manage without
    them although he sometimes struggled.  He could not say how  much  they
    actually gave him but sometimes they bought things from  town  or  from
    the local grocery.

Resumed hearing on 11 November 2015

47. At the commencement of the hearing Miss Khan applied for an adjournment
    to enable a friend of the family, Mr Stuart  Hanson  JP  to  give  oral
    evidence in support of Mr Choudhry's appeal.  He was abroad and  unable
    to come to the Tribunal.  He had attended the wedding of [MR] and  [AK]
    and would be able to give important evidence about their  relationship.
    She asked that the other witnesses give their evidence today  but  that
    the appeal be adjourned at that point in order to allow  Mr  Hanson  to
    attend.

48. I refused the application.  The solicitors have produced a full witness
    statement from Mr Hanson which I will take into account in reaching  my
    conclusions.  It is difficult to see what else could be  added  by  his
    attendance.  Furthermore this appeal has already been adjourned on  one
    occasion.  Evidence was taken on 8th September 2015.  If the appeal was
    adjourned again there would be too long an interval between the hearing
    of the main evidence and the final resolution of the appeal.

49. Mr Diwncyz gave me some further information about the employment of the
    EEA national.  According to the Inland Revenue she began  work  on  1st
    September 2015 but ceased on 11th September 2015.   In  time  he  would
    have been able to get that information  in  writing,  but  it  was  not
    challenged  by  Miss  Khan  and  again  there  was  no  need  to  delay
    proceedings.  I gave Miss Khan the opportunity of  taking  instructions
    from Mr Choudhry who was recalled to give evidence on that  point.   He
    confirmed that [AK] had only been employed for a little over a week  at
    the Ocean Fast Food Takeaway.  Mr Choudhry said that  she  had  stopped
    work because her daughter was ill and there was no  one  else  to  look
    after her.  Her own mother was not available because she  was  working.
    The daughter was now recovered and [AK] was trying to find a  job  near
    her  house.   She  had  also  registered  with  an  agency,  Three  Way
    Solutions, and requested part-time work.  When asked if he intended  to
    inform the court of the change of circumstances Mr Choudhry  said  that
    they were supposed to give the information today.



Evidence of [MbH]

50. [MbH] is the appellant's brother-in-law.  Mr Choudhry's wife is [MbH's]
    sister.  He confirmed that  he  supports  his  sister  and  her  family
    financially and emotionally particularly since his  sister  has  had  a
    recent cancer diagnosis and her overall health and wellbeing  has  been
    affected considerably.

51. He was present at his nephew's wedding  at  St  Augustine's  Church  in
    Halifax and said that  it  was  a  genuine  marriage  and  not  one  of
    convenience.

52. Mr Diwncyz asked him if he was present throughout  the  whole  ceremony
    and [MbH] confirmed that  he  was.   He  said  that  the  ceremony  was
    conducted in English and there was no interpreter present.  It was  put
    to him that [MR] had said that there was an interpreter who was able to
    translate both into  Punjabi  and  Lithuanian.   [MbH]  said  that  the
    ceremony was conducted only in English and his nephew used alcohol  and
    could not remember what went on.  He had become depressed following the
    separation with his wife.

53. [MbH] said that he last saw [AK] at  the  family  home  in  10  [-]  in
    September/October 2014 but had had no contact with her since then.

Evidence of [HuR]

54. [HuR] is the eldest son of the family.  He confirmed that the  contents
    of his witness statement were true and correct.  In that  statement  he
    said that he lived within his three brothers and his parents at 10 [-],
    Halifax.  It was put to him that  according  to  his  uncle  [MH],  the
    appellant and his wife live at 42 [-], Halifax.  [HuR]  explained  that
    they used to all live together but because his mother was not well, and
    the house was overcrowded, they had temporarily moved out about a  year
    ago.  He accepted that at the time he made his  statement  saying  that
    they all lived at 10 [-] his parents were in fact at 42 [-].

55. [HuR] said that he had seen [AK] about a month ago when he  had  bumped
    into her in town.  They spoke briefly.

56. He was asked when he had found out that she had left his  brother.   He
    said that when his father came back from Pakistan and  was  stopped  by
    the immigration authorities the family discovered  what  the  situation
    was.  [MR] had not told them before.

57. [HuR] had difficulty in saying when he had seen her before  his  father
    returned from Pakistan but thought that it was about a month before  he
    had embarked which would have been around February 2014.

Evidence of [HR]

58. [HR] is the third son of the family.  He also accepted that although he
    had said in his statement that his parents were living  at  10  [-]  in
    fact they had moved out to 42 [-] about a year ago.   However  he  said
    that they spent most of the day at 10 [-].

59. He had also met [AK]  a  few  months  ago  in  town  and  had  a  brief
    conversation with her.

60. [HR] said that [AK] had stopped living at 10 [-] in September 2013.  He
    had asked his brother where she was and had been told that she was  not
    well.  He only became aware that they were no longer living together as
    man and wife when his father returned from Pakistan in April 2014.

61. He gave a little information about Stuart Hanson whom he described as a
    very close friend of his father who had been to the house  on  numerous
    occasions.  He had taught English at the mosque.

Evidence of [AR]

62. The last of the brothers  is  [AR]  who  similarly  accepted  that  his
    statement was inaccurate in that it described his parents as living  at
    10 [-] whereas in fact they had been in 42 [-] for about a year.

63. When asked when he had last seen [AK] he thought it was around February
    2014 but ever since she had married she  had  stayed  with  her  mother
    quite a bit.  He said that he was aware that she was not  living  there
    between September and December 2013 but he did not remember  any  other
    occasion when she was not living at the house.

Evidence of [MfH]

64. [MfH] is another  brother  of  [MB],  the  appellant's  wife.   In  his
    statement he confirmed that the marriage was genuine and he  said  that
    he had met her once or twice at the family home in  10  [-].   He  then
    said that he had met her once when she had attended at court.   He  had
    difficulty remembering any dates.

Evidence of [WD]

65. [WD] is the appellant's half brother.  They have different mothers  and
    share the same father.  His family lives in Manchester but he sees  his
    brother regularly.

66. He also said that he had met [AK] several times at 10 [-] and had  last
    seen her there around September 2013.  When he visited the family,  she
    was there most of the time.  He went three or four times a year and she
    was generally there.

Evidence of [ND]

67. [ND] is another brother and also lives in Manchester.

68. [ND] said that he visited 10 [-] at least once a  month  and  [AK]  was
    there for the majority of the time.  He may have seen her up to  twenty
    times.  It was generally in passing because often [MR]  and  [AK]  were
    either on their way in or out or asleep.  He had  never  had  a  proper
    conversation with her because there was a language barrier.  She  spoke
    in broken English, but enough to communicate.

Evidence of Arshad Khan

69. Arshad Khan is a project worker at the Healthy  Living  Partnership  in
    Halifax.  In his written statement he gave a  character  reference  for
    the appellant but added, in oral  evidence,  that  [MR]  and  [AK]  had
    enrolled on a healthy cooking course together.  They  attended  all  of
    the classes over an eight week period.  He was able  to  confirm  their
    attendance not because he had taught the course but because he  had  to
    administer the evaluation and he could see from the register that  they
    had attended.

The Documentary Evidence

Witness Statements

70. [AK] has provided several witness statements.  The first is  dated  2nd
    June 2012.  She said that she met [MR] through a mutual friend, [D]  at
    Shibden Park in Halifax.  She does not give a date.

71. She confirmed that the couple married on 5th September  2009  but  that
    her mother did not want her to marry and did not  attend  the  wedding.
    Following the ceremony they walked back to her mother's house and  then
    on to 10 [-] where there was a  wedding  party.   Her  mother  did  not
    attend.

72. She said that they lived with [MR's] family but because there  was  not
    much room for her stuff at 10 [-] she kept a lot of possessions at  her
    mother's house.  She calls [MR's] parents mum and dad.

73. She gave part of her wages to [MR] who then passed the money on to  the
    rest of the family.

74. At the time of the  wedding  she  was  working  through  an  employment
    agency.  She initially worked with S Sheard and Son Limited and she was
    aware that they had informed the Immigration Officer that she had given
    her home address as 22 [-] in May 2011.   She  did  not  remember  that
    anyone at S Sheard and Son had ever asked her  for  her  address.   She
    noted that her payslips contained her mother's address and although she
    asked the supervisor to update it and he had said that it would be done
    in fact it never was.

75. She was aware that the Home Office had arranged an appointment for  her
    and [MR] to attend their office on 7th November 2011 but  she  was  not
    well and was staying with her mother because it was too busy and  noisy
    at 10 [-].

76. She was interviewed on 16th January 2012 but the Home  Office  did  not
    provide interpreters and the interview record was not read back to her.
     She was aware that she and  [MR]  had  given  different  answers  when
    describing the bedroom but explained that, following  an  earlier  leak
    from the roof, new carpets had just been laid and at the  same  time  a
    wardrobe was removed.  She was not aware of this at  the  time  of  the
    interview.

77. On 16th January 2012 she informed her supervisor at S  Sheard  and  Son
    that she would be leaving them but she did  not  hand  in  any  written
    notice.  [MR] was not aware of this before the interview with the  Home
    Office.  Her friends had informed her that there were jobs in Ramsgate.
     Her plan was to find a job there and for [MR] to join her once she had
    found employment.  She did go to Ramsgate but only stayed there  for  a
    week and then returned to Halifax.

78. Once she had left S Sheard and  Sons  she  registered  with  Three  Way
    Solutions in Halifax and gets two or three  days  per  week  employment
    there.  She confirmed that the marriage was genuine.

79. The final witness statement is dated 3rd September 2015.  She confirmed
    that the marriage was genuine.  She and her husband had their  ups  and
    downs mainly due to living in an overcrowded household.  They split  up
    in September/October 2013 after she had  become  pregnant  by  somebody
    else.  She had just started part-time work as a cleaner in  a  takeaway
    in Halifax.

80. Witness statements have also been provided from Mr Stewart  Hanson  who
    describes  himself  as  a  family  friend  but  who   is   also   their
    representative having acted  on  their  behalf  when  Mr  Choudhry  was
    stopped in April 2014 on re-entry to the UK.

81. Mr Hanson said in his statement that he had visited the family at 10 [-
    ] approximately six times.  He  attended  the  church  wedding  on  5th
    September 2009 and as a practising Christian he would not have done  so
    if he had thought at any  stage  that  it  was  a  sham  marriage.   He
    provided two photographs of the wedding.  There are also half  a  dozen
    photographs of the wedding in  the  appellant's  bundle.  He  makes  no
    reference to his having actually seen [AK] in the family  home  on  his
    visits.

82. The family have also produced a number of other witness statements from
    [ZB], [SB] and [KB] who were not able to give evidence and two  witness
    statements from friends, and a  number  of  character  references  from
    local councillors and from the general secretary of the local mosque.

Documentary Evidence in Support of [AK's] Residence at 10 [-]

83. There are a number of bank statements addressed to [AK] at 10 [-]  from
    Santander Bank dating from March 2010 to August 2010 and February  2011
    to September 2011.  There is also a letter  from  Calderdale  Interface
    Council addressed to her at that address dated 28th  February  2011,  a
    letter from Voluntary Action Calderdale dated 28th March 2011, a second
    letter from Calderdale Interface Council dated  3rd  June  2011  and  a
    letter from the Healthy Living Partnership dated 22nd June 2011.  There
    is also a letter from Talk Talk dated 7th November 2011.

84. Amongst the 859 pages of documents there is extensive evidence of Abdul
    Rashid Choudhry's residence at 10 [-] together with  the  residence  of
    his wife and four children which is uncontentious.

Evidence of [AK's] Work in the UK

85. There  is  some  evidence  of  [AK's]  employment  in  the  UK  in  the
    appellant's bundle which is confirmed by a letter from HM  Revenue  and
    Customs dated 4th September 2015.  In the tax year  2009  to  2010  she
    earned �2,437 gross with S Sheard and Sons Limited and �1,547 with Eton
    Payroll Services Limited.

86. In 2010 to 2011 she earned �16,243 with S Sheard and Sons Limited.

87. In 2011 to 2012 she earned �50 with Three  Way  Solutions  Limited  and
    �13,685 with S Sheard and Sons Limited.   She  also  earned  �153  with
    Vital Recruitment Peterborough Limited.

88. In 2012 2013 she earned �1,558 with Three Way Solutions Limited.

89. In 2013 to 2014 she  earned  �4,922  again  with  Three  Way  Solutions
    Limited and the Inland Revenue notes  that  records  show  a  claim  to
    benefits.

90. In 2014 to 15 she was shown as earning a nil income.

91. She also provided an  accountant's  letter  dated  2nd  September  2015
    confirming her employment as a cleaner at �104.   It  is  not  disputed
    that that employment only lasted just over a week.

92. So far as the issue of dependency is  concerned  there  is  documentary
    evidence of a payment from [MR] to the appellant of �50  on  3rd  March
    2015, 30th March, �75 on 24th April and �50 on 5th  May.   It  was  the
    appellant's oral evidence that [MR] gave him around �50 every week.  He
    was emotionally dependent upon his son  and  he  helped  him  with  his
    medicine.  He was also supportive during his wife's illness.

The Respondent's Evidence

93. The respondent has not provided a transcript  of  the  interview  which
    took place upon the appellant's arrival in the UK on  8th  April  2014.
    She has provided the notes of the interview which took place on 6th May
    but not of any attendance notes on 8th and 12th May.  In that interview
    the appellant confirmed that his son was married to an EEA national and
    he gave her name and nationality and the date of the wedding.  He  said
    that he had not attended because he was busy at the mosque and  he  had
    not attended because his son had  married  with  his  own  choice.   He
    confirmed that his son and daughter-in-law lived at 10 [-].

94. The respondent has also provided the letter of 29th April 2014 inviting
    Mr Choudhry and [MR] to interview.  The letter points out that [AK]  is
    not legally required to attend as she is not the subject of enquiry but
    without her support it is not difficult to  see  how  the  applications
    would be prejudiced and likely to fail.

95. There are extracts from [AK's] Facebook page which revealed a  timeline
    going back several years but did  not  mention  her  husband  anywhere.
    They show several photographs of a  man  who  is  believed  to  be  her
    current partner.

96. The respondent also made a check on  the  register  of  electors  which
    showed [AK] as an occupant of 22 [-] and was never registered at 10  [-
    ].

97. The respondent relies on the Immigration Officer's  report  dated  18th
    January 2012 which  led  to  the  respondent's  refusal  to  grant  the
    appellant a residence card on 20th February 2012.  It was this decision
    of course which was the subject of the  appeal  to  Judge  Howard  and,
    following it being allowed, was reversed and the residence card  issued
    on 22nd July 2013.

98. The Immigration Officer recorded that she had contacted [AK's] employer
    and had been told that her next of kin was listed as her mother and her
    address was given at 22 [-].

99. She noted that [AK] could only name her husband's parents  and  one  of
    his brothers but not his other brother's aunt or uncle or  their  three
    children despite having claimed to have lived with them for two  years.
    There were discrepancies between the two of them  in  relation  to  how
    much time [AK] spent at the house, about her employment and  they  each
    gave a different description of the bedroom they were  supposed  to  be
    sharing.

100. Finally, there is the report from Kent Police dated 17th December  2012
    and therefore after  Judge  Howard's  determination  which  records  an
    interview with [AK] who told the interviewing officer that she had been
    a sex worker for four months working in London as an escort  previously
    and with the present agency for about a month.  She gave her address as
    22 [-], Halifax.

Findings and Conclusions

101. The starting point for the consideration of the  findings  of  fact  is
    the determination of Judge Howard promulgated on 13th  September  2012.
    Judge Howard heard oral evidence from many of the same witnesses  as  I
    have heard today but, significantly, also from [AK].

102. Judge Howard  records  her  evidence  that  she  had  never  given  her
    employer her address and that any address  that  they  had  been  given
    would have been by the agency which  sent  her.   They  had  only  ever
    sought a contact telephone number from her.  She said that she had seen
    her mother's address on the wage slips and at least twice asked them to
    update their records.  There was a clear conflict between what she said
    and what the respondent was told.  Since he  had  not  heard  from  the
    maker of the statement, and there were a  number  of  reasons  why  the
    records may not have been updated he accepted the evidence of  [AK]  on
    the point.

103. He then wrote as follows

         "Further, during the conversation with the employee of  Sheard  and
         Son the respondent was told that [AK] had handed in her notice  and
         was to look for work in Ramsgate,  Kent.   This  was  confirmed  in
         evidence.  Apparently she has friends there.  Her plan was to  find
         work and for her husband to join her  thereafter.   The  plan  died
         when she was unable to find work.  The dates suggest [AK] handed in
         her notice on the day of the interview."

104. The judge analysed the interview record.  He was not satisfied  so  far
    as the answers to the description of the  bedroom  were  concerned  and
    said  that  he  found  the  evidence  to  be  wholly  unconvincing.   A
    reasonable  suspicion  had  been  raised.   However  set  against   the
    remainder of the interview where consistent answers were given  he  was
    satisfied that the evidential burden had been met and that  the  colour
    of the carpet was no more than a genuine mistake.

105. Devaseelan (Second  Appeals  -  ECHR  -  Extraterritorial  Effect)  Sri
    Lanka* [2002] UKIAT 00702 sets out the  proper  approach  to  a  second
    adjudication.  The Tribunal holds

         "The First Adjudicator's determination stands (unchallenged, or not
         successfully  challenged)  as  an  assessment  of  the  claim   the
         appellant was then making, at the time of that  determination.   It
         is not binding on the Second Adjudicator; but, on the  other  hand,
         the Second Adjudicator is not hearing an appeal against it.  As  an
         assessment of the matters that were before the First Adjudicator it
         should simply be regarded as unquestioned.  It may be  built  upon,
         and, as a result, the outcome of  the  hearing  before  the  Second
         Adjudicator might be quite different  from  what  might  have  been
         expected from a reading of the first determination only.  But it is
         not the Second Adjudicator's role to consider arguments intended to
         undermine the First Adjudicator's determination.

         The Second Adjudicator must, however be careful to  recognise  that
         the issue before him is not the issue that  was  before  the  First
         Adjudicator.  In particular, time has passed; and the situation  at
         the time of the Second Adjudicator's determination may be shown  to
         be different from that which obtained previously.   Appellants  may
         want to ask the Second Adjudicator to consider arguments on  issues
         that were not  -  or  could  not  be  -  raised  before  the  First
         Adjudicator; or evidence that was not - or could not  have  been  -
         presented to the First Adjudicator."

106. The Tribunal then set out the approach to further evidence.  The  First
    Adjudicator's  determination  should  always  be  the  starting  point.
    However facts happening since the First Adjudicator's determination can
    always be taken into account by the  Second  Adjudicator.   If  matters
    which could have been before the First Adjudicator but were not should,
    in  the  assessment  of  credibility,  be  treated  with  the  greatest
    circumspection.

107. Applying those principles to the facts of this case, Miss  Khan  argued
    that the evidence from the electoral roll could have been presented  to
    Judge Howard but  the  respondent  chose  not  to  do  so.   She  asked
    therefore that it be given little weight.

108. The submission is misconceived.  The credibility of the  evidence  from
    the electoral roll is not in doubt.  There may be a question mark as to
    why it was not produced earlier, but the answer to that question cannot
    be that the evidence itself is suspect.

109. So far as the evidence from Kent Police is concerned, that  is  plainly
    a matter arising since  the  determination  of  Judge  Howard.   It  is
    clearly highly relevant.  It wholly undermines the  evidence  given  by
    [AK] at the hearing when she apparently told the judge that she planned
    to find work in Kent and for her husband to join her thereafter.  Given
    the nature of the work in which she was engaged, this is most unlikely.



The Law

110. Under the Immigration EEA Regulations 2006 "spouse" does not include  a
    party to a marriage of convenience.  Accordingly, the  appellant  would
    not be entitled to a residence card as the dependent direct relative in
    the ascending line of his son  [MR]  if  his  marriage  to  [AK]  is  a
    marriage of convenience.

111. Marriages of convenience are defined for the purposes of the  directive
    as

         "Marriages contracted for the sole purpose of enjoying the right of
         free movement and residence under the directive that someone  would
         not have otherwise.  A marriage cannot be considered as a  marriage
         of convenience simply because it brings an  immigration  advantage,
         or indeed any other advantage."

112. In Papajorgji (EEA Spouse -  Marriage  of  Convenience)  Greece  [2012]
    UKUT 00038 the Tribunal held

         "(i) There is no burden at  the  outset  of  an  application  on  a
             claimant to demonstrate that a marriage to an EEA national  is
             not one of convenience.

         (ii)  IS  (Marriages  of  Convenience)  Serbia  [2008]   UKAIT   31
             establishes only that there is an  evidential  burden  on  the
             Claimant to address evidence justifying  reasonable  suspicion
             that the marriage is entered into for the predominant  purpose
             of securing residence rights."

113. In IS the Tribunal said

         "Not every applicant needs to prove that his marriage is not one of
         convenience.  The need to do so only arises where there are factors
         which support suspicions for believing that the marriage is one  of
         convenience.  Translated into the technical language of the English
         law of procedure and evidence, that means there  is  an  evidential
         burden on the respondent.  If  there  is  no  evidence  that  could
         support a conclusion that the marriage is one of  convenience,  the
         appellant does not have to deal with the issue."

114. Again, in Papajorgji the Tribunal said

         "This passage indicates that the AIT concluded that  there  was  no
         burden on an applicant in an EU case until  the  respondent  raised
         the issue by evidence.  If there was such evidence it was  for  the
         applicant to produce evidence to address the  suspicions.   In  our
         judgment such an approach can be described as one of an  evidential
         burden in the first place on the respondent and  then  shifting  to
         the Claimant in the light of the relevant information rather than a
         formal legal burden.  We agree with that approach."

115. It was Miss Khan's first submission that  the  initial  burden  on  the
    respondent to provide evidence justifying reasonable suspicion had  not
    been discharged.  She reminded  me  that  the  information  before  the
    Immigration Officer on 8th April 2014 was that which was  before  Judge
    Howard and which had been accepted by him.

116. When the appellant and his son were stopped at the airport  they  could
    not provide [AK's] date of birth or a contact number for her  and  that
    they did not know if she worked or  what  she  did  for  a  living.  No
    transcript of that conversation has been provided,  but  the  appellant
    accepts that they did not know her  date  of  birth  or  her  telephone
    number. He maintains that they were not asked any questions  about  her
    work and the interview only lasted for a few minutes.

117. For reasons which are outlined later in  this  determination,  although
    there is no direct  evidence  from  the  respondent,  I  have  had  the
    opportunity of assessing the evidence of the appellant and I find it to
    be wholly lacking in credibility.  I therefore prefer to  rely  on  the
    assertion made in the IS125 that the appellant and his son did not know
    if [AK] worked or what she did for a living and that the  appellant  is
    not truthful when he says that they were not asked any questions.

118. Subsequently [MR] was asked to attend at interview on 29th April  2014.
     A fax was received from Stuart  Hanson  described  as  an  immigration
    advisor querying  the  need  for  attendance,  and  the  interview  was
    postponed.

119. The IS125 states that the appellant attended for further interview  but
    was not accompanied by his  son  or  [AK].   Nor  had  he  brought  any
    evidence with him to demonstrate  cohabitation,  [AK's]  occupation  or
    that the marriage was otherwise genuine.

120. In his rebuttal statement the appellant says that he was not  asked  to
    bring any evidence to demonstrate co-habitation.  I have a copy of  the
    letter dated 29th April 2014 which makes it clear what the  purpose  of
    the interview was.  By this stage the  appellant  had  the  benefit  of
    legal advice from Mr Hanson.

121. I do not accept that he did not bring the evidence because he  did  not
    realise that he had to do so.

122. The IS125 criticises the appellant for  not  being  able  to  spell  or
    pronounce [AK's] name.  He says that this is correct  and  he  provided
    [AK's] name twice but it is difficult to spell.  It is clear  from  the
    interview record that the appellant did give [AK's] name and  I  accept
    that  its  spelling  is  complicated.    I   also   accept   that   the
    characterisation in the IS125 that the whole family were  dependent  on
    [AK] is not a wholly accurate reflection of the  interview  notes,  but
    nothing hangs on this.  It is after all the appellant's case that he is
    dependent on her.

123. It is correct and regrettable  that  there  is  no  transcript  of  the
    attendances on 8th and 12th May.  The  encounter  on  8th  May  appears
    simply  to  have  been  the  filing  of  documentary  evidence  by  the
    appellant.

124. So far as the interview on 12th May is concerned neither the  appellant
    nor his son [AR] challenge the assertion on page 2 of  the  IS125  that
    they were asked if they were still residing with  [AK]  and  they  said
    "sometime" but they would not elaborate.  By this point the Immigration
    Officer had spoken to [AK] who had told them  that  she  and  [MR]  had
    split up a year earlier.  She was expecting  a  baby  but  it  was  her
    boyfriend's.  When told that the Immigration Officer had spoken to [AK]
    who had said that she had not been in a relationship with [MR] for over
    a year [AR] said that they had not known about it but then said that he
    was aware that the relationship had broken down.

125. Whilst the appellant does not address the issue at all,  [AR]  says  in
    his rebuttal statement that he had told the Immigration Officer that he
    did not know that [AK] and [MR] had split up let alone  that  this  had
    happened over a year ago.  He said that he and his father were in shock
    when the Immigration Officer informed them about it and  they  actually
    did not believe him.

126. That is wholly inconsistent with the  oral  evidence  today  which  was
    that [AR] was aware that [AK] had  not  been  living  at  10  [-]  from
    September to December 2013 and he could not remember any other  periods
    when she was not there.

127. Accordingly, by the date of the decision, on 13th May  2014  to  refuse
    the appellant admission under European Community law and the subsequent
    revocation of the residence card on 8th September 2014  the  respondent
    had the following information in front of her

      i) The determination of Immigration Judge Howard and his finding  that
         the marriage between the EEA national and [MR] was genuine.

     ii) The failure of the appellant, on 8th April 2014 to give [AK's] date
         of birth or contact number or any details of where and whether  she
         worked.

    iii) The failure of the appellant to bring evidence of co-habitation  on
         6th May 2014, except for some bank statements, Talk Talk bills  and
         a few letters.

     iv) The information provided on 12th May 2014 that [AK] was expecting a
         baby by another man and  that  the  couple  had  split  up  a  year
         earlier.

    (v)  The failure of [AK] to come forward despite repeated requests  for
         her to do so.

    (vi) The register of electors indicated that she and  her  husband  had
         never lived at the same address.

    (vii)    Evidence from Facebook which did not mention her  husband  and
         no mention that they had ever been in a relationship.

128. Miss Khan submitted that  Facebook  histories  could  be  changed  and,
    given that [AK] had moved on with her life it was quite likely that  by
    the time of the print-out her previous marriage had been deleted.

129. That may or may not be right but even leaving that aside, the  evidence
    before the respondent at the time the decision was made was  sufficient
    to discharge the burden of proof upon her that  there  were  reasonable
    suspicions that this was a marriage of convenience.

130. The evidential burden therefore shifts to the appellant to  prove  that
    the marriage is not one of convenience.

131. Whilst  cohabitation  is  not  strictly  necessary,  since  it  is  the
    appellant's case that the couple cohabited in her house for four  years
    clearly, if that was found to be untrue it would  severely  damage  the
    credibility of this claim.

132. In the appellant's favour there is  a  certain  amount  of  documentary
    evidence, mainly Santander bank statements sent to the address  between
    March 2010 and September 2011.  There is also a letter from  Talk  Talk
    dated 7th November 2011 and a couple of letters  addressed  to  her  at
    that address.  Amongst those letters is one  from  the  Healthy  Living
    Partnership and the oral evidence from Arshad Khan that the couple  did
    a cookery course together for eight weeks.

133. There is no documentary evidence that [AK] was registered with a GP  at
    that address, although there is evidence that [MR] was.   The  evidence
    from the electoral register and from  her  employer  is  that  she  was
    living with her mother.  There are also a few photographs  and  witness
    statements from family members and supporters.

134. The evidence from Kent Police is unchallenged.   [AK]  was  clearly  in
    London and Kent from around August to December 2012.

135. There is no reason to doubt Mr Hanson's bona  fides  but  the  evidence
    which he could give as to the genuineness of the marriage is limited to
    the instructions which he was given as their representative  and  to  a
    few visits to the family home  when  it  is  not  said  that  [AK]  was
    present.

136. I turn to the oral evidence.

137.  Sadly  much  of  what  has  been  told  to  me  in  this  Tribunal  is
    demonstrably untrue.  The appellant started by telling Mr Diwncyz  that
    he slept in one of the rooms  at  10  [-]  and  described  which  other
    members of the family slept in each room.  It was only when  [MH]  gave
    evidence that it transpired that in fact the  appellant  and  his  wife
    lived at 42 [-], a three bedroomed house and had not been living at  10
    [-] for the last year.  Each and every one of the sons signed a witness
    statement in August 2015 stating that they and their  parents  had  all
    lived together at their present address since 2003.  None were  telling
    the truth.

138. The appellant had great difficulty in saying when  [AK]  lived  at  the
    house.  He was vague and confused but finally stated definitively  that
    it was his evidence that [AK] was living at the house most of the  time
    until he went to Pakistan in March 2014.   In  re-examination  he  said
    that he saw her almost every day.  It  was  put  to  him  that  in  his
    witness  statement  he  had  said  that  the   couple   split   up   in
    September/October 2013.  He then said that after the separation he  did
    not see her.  However he also  said  that  he  was  not  aware  of  the
    separation until he came back from Pakistan.  He did when it was put to
    him that there was a difficulty with his evidence he said that  he  did
    not know what had happened to her  between  September  2013  and  March
    2014.  He said that [MR] had told him that [AK] was  spending  most  of
    the time with her mother.

139. [MR] said that he saw his wife every day between  2009  and  2013.   Mr
    Diwncyz asked him repeatedly if he physically saw her every day  during
    that period and he said that he did.

140. When the Kent Police report dated December 2012 was put to him he  said
    that he had no knowledge of [AK]  having  been  away  for  five  months
    working as a sex worker.  He had thought that she was  staying  with  a
    friend.

141. The police report is wholly inconsistent with  the  evidence  given  to
    the Tribunal that, apart from spending time with  her  mother,  between
    2009 and the claimed date of the break up of the marriage in  September
    2013, [AK] was living at 10 [-].

142. The appellant also stated that the news that [AK]  had  split  up  with
    [MR] and was pregnant by another man came as a shock to them when  they
    were informed of it in April 2014.  It appears that he was aware of her
    pregnancy because he told the Immigration Officer that she was ill as a
    consequence.

143. If the  baby  was  born  in  June/July  2014  he/she  would  have  been
    conceived at about the time that it was said that [MR]  and  [AK]  were
    splitting up, in September 2013, which is unlikely.  Moreover [AK]  had
    spent at least five months of the previous year working as a sex worker
    in Ramsgate.  I do not accept that the family believed  that  [AK]  was
    pregnant with [MR's] child, and to suggest that the Immigration Officer
    in effect broke the news to them that the marriage had ended is frankly
    ridiculous.

144.  [MR]  also  struggled  with  the  evidence  of  his  wife's  religion.
    Eventually he said that she was a Catholic and she attended the  church
    where they got married.  On the marriage certificate it  says  that  St
    Augustines is a Church of England.  When asked why they had chosen that
    church if [AK] was Catholic he said that she could  get  coffees  there
    and they look after you.

145. He agreed that he was a strict Muslim and attended the mosque but  said
    that he had married in church because [AK]  did  not  want  an  Islamic
    wedding.  He also,  somewhat  surprisingly,  said  that  there  was  an
    interpreter  in  the  church  interpreting  into   both   Punjabi   and
    Lithuanian, a claim flatly contradicted by his uncle who was  the  only
    member of the family in attendance.

146. The person who could give the most relevant evidence is of course  [AK]
    herself.  She has chosen to be absent.  I was informed that she was not
    willing to attend court.

147. She did of course attend before Judge Howard and  Miss  Khan  submitted
    that I should be very slow in disagreeing with his  assessment  of  her
    credibility.  However matters have moved on since then.  Some  of  what
    she said to Judge Howard has  been  shown  to  be  plainly  wrong,  for
    example, in relation to her plans for her husband to join her when  she
    had found work in Kent.

148. It is quite clear that  the  family  are  in  contact  with  her.   She
    cooperated with them in September 2015  in  providing  an  accountant's
    letter and a payslip in relation to her week's work at a  takeaway.   I
    have no reason to disbelieve the evidence of two of the  brothers  when
    they said that they  had  run  into  her  by  chance  on  a  couple  of
    occasions.

149. I accept that she was in  a  friendly  relationship  with  the  family.
    There is no reason to doubt Mr  Khan's  recollection  of  their  having
    attended a cookery course together.

150. Neither do I doubt the evidence of the [D] brothers who said that  they
    saw her from time to time when they visited Halifax.  [WD] said that he
    saw her several times.  [ND's] estimate that he  had  seen  her  twenty
    times is exaggerated because if he saw her three or four times  a  year
    for the four years when it is being said that the couple were  together
    it does not add up to twenty.  He was keen to say that he only saw  her
    in passing and that often the couple were on their way out  or  asleep.
    If they  were  asleep  it  would  have  been  in  their  bedroom.   The
    inconsistencies given to the Immigration Officer about the bedroom were
    found to be damaging by Judge Howard and he found  the  evidence  of  a
    leaking roof and damaged carpet to be wholly unconvincing.

151. The fact that [AK] was friendly  with  the  family  and  that  she  was
    occasionally present at their home is not at all inconsistent with  her
    having entered into a marriage of convenience with [MR].

152. I do of course accept that the fact that the marriage has  broken  down
    and that [AK] is now in a relationship with somebody else and  has  his
    child is not evidence in itself which establishes that she entered into
    a marriage of convenience in 2009.  Genuine marriages  break  down  and
    the fact that this marriage broke down does not mean that it was one of
    convenience.

153. There is evidence from Santander Bank, and from Talk Talk and from  the
    local community of [AK]  living  at  10  [-]  but  the  most  important
    evidence, from her employer and from the electoral  register,  and  the
    absence of evidence from a GP is against her.  There is  also  evidence
    that she was present in the home, but the people  who  could  give  the
    most accurate picture of her living there were all  untruthful  to  the
    Tribunal.

154. Taking into account the evidence as a whole I conclude that the  burden
    on the appellant has not been discharged.

155. Accordingly I conclude that the appellant has not established  that  he
    is the family member of an EEA national.

The Qualification Issue

156. Although strictly it is not necessary to determine whether  [AK]  is  a
    qualified person within the meaning of the Regulations I do so for  the
    sake of completeness.

157. The evidence from the Inland Revenue is that [AK]  worked  in  the  tax
    year from 2013 to 2014 but has not earned anything since.   She  had  a
    baby in June/July 2014.  She also worked for a single week in September
    2015.

158. In order to satisfy Regulation 6, she has  to  establish  that  she  is
    continuing to seek employment with a genuine chance of  being  engaged.
    According to her own evidence she last worked in October 2013 and aside
    from that has only worked for a single week.  She has of course  had  a
    baby in June 2014.

159. I do not accept the oral evidence that she was unable to  work  as  the
    result of her  daughter's  illness.   It  is  clear  to  me  that,  had
    enquiries not been made of the Inland Revenue, the fact that  [AK]  had
    only worked for a single week would not have been disclosed.   I  place
    no weight upon the claim that  her  daughter's  illness  prevented  her
    working, in the absence of any documentary evidence, but in  any  event
    it is clear that she recovered from that illness and yet [AK]  did  not
    return to work.  There is no evidence that she has registered as a  job
    seeker with the relevant employment office.

160. The print-out from Three Way Solutions dated  23rd  July  2015  running
    from 6th April 2010 to 5th April 2016 do  not  show  any  hours  worked
    after December 2013 nearly two years ago.  She  therefore  ceased  work
    well before her baby was born and has only done one week since  in  the
    last two years.  That pattern of  work  is  insufficient  to  meet  the
    requirements of Regulation 6.

161. There is no evidence of any other basis upon  which  the  EEA  national
    could be considered to be a qualified person.

162.  Finally,  the  appellant  has  to  establish  dependency.   The   sole
    documentary evidence relating to dependency consists of a few transfers
    of �50.

163. Until March 2014 the appellant was  receiving  job  seeker's  allowance
    and his wife used to receive employment  support  allowance.   He  said
    that he was supported by his children who all worked.

164. In the 800 pages of documents which have been produced very few  relate
    to Mr Choudhry's finances and only cover a two month period.   They  do
    show that his sons,  including  [MR],  make  some  transfers  into  the
    account but a total of �225 over a three month  period  from  March  to
    June 2015 is not a sufficient basis to establish financial  dependency.
