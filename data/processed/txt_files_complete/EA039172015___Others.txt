Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr S Ahmed of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Proceedings

   1. The Appellants are all citizens of Pakistan. The first  Appellant  was
      born on 20th of March 1983 and the 2nd Appellant was born  on  7th  of
      September 1984. They are married to each other and  the  3rd  and  4th
      Appellants are their children born on 4th of March 2012  and  17th  of
      October 2014  respectively.  The  1st  Appellant  entered  the  United
      Kingdom as a student in July 2010 and the  2nd  Appellant  joined  him
      here as a student dependent in June  2011.  She  gave  birth  to  both
      children in this country. In June  2015  the  Appellants  applied  for
      residence cards on the  grounds  that  the  1st  Appellant's  maternal
      uncle, a Belgian citizen, had supported him  financially  in  Pakistan
      and continue to support him financially in  the  United  Kingdom.  The
      Appellants were also members of the uncle's household in this country.




   2. The applications were refused by the Respondent  on  7th  of  December
      2015 because there was said to be insufficient evidence of  prior  and
      present dependency upon  an  EEA  national  sponsor  and  insufficient
      evidence of membership of the household of that EEA national sponsor.


   3. The Appellant's appeal against that decision came before Judge of  the
      First-tier Tribunal Monson sitting at Taylor House on  16th  of  March
      2017. He  found  that  there  was  no  right  of  appeal  against  the
      Respondent's decision following the Upper Tribunal authority  of  Sala
      [2016] UKUT 411. That decision held that where an applicant was making
      an application for a residence card under  Regulation  8  of  the  EEA
      Regulations 2006 as an extended family member the Regulations did  not
      give a right of appeal because there was no entitlement to a residence
      card by an applicant  under  Regulation  8,  it  was  a  discretionary
      provision.


   4. Subsequently that decision was overturned by the Court  of  Appeal  in
      the case of Khan [2017] EWCA Civ 1755. The Court of Appeal found  that
      on their true construction the 2006  Regulations  did  provide  for  a
      right of appeal. Although the judgement in Khan was handed down on 9th
      of November 2017 some  seven  months  after  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      hearing in this case because the decision was to find  that  the  2006
      Regulations had always provided for a right of appeal  the  First-tier
      decision in this case was retrospectively invalidated.


   5. Following the dismissal of the appeals for want  of  jurisdiction  the
      Appellants had appealed that decision and  permission  to  appeal  was
      granted by Judge of the Upper Tribunal Jordan on 19th of December 2017
      on the  basis  of  the  clarification  of  the  meaning  of  the  2006
      Regulations in Khan.


 6. When the matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  there  was  a
    material error  of  law  in  the  determination,  I  indicated  that  I
    considered there was (because of the  decision  in  Khan)  and  neither
    party disputed that. Both parties agreed that  the  correct  course  of
    action was to remit this appeal back to the First-tier Tribunal with no
    findings preserved for the matter to be re-determined. I therefore  set
    aside the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  the  grounds  of
    material error of law and I remit  the  case  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be reheard with no findings preserved.





Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
    law and I have set it aside. I remit the appeal back to the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be reheard by any Judge other than Judge Monson.

Appellant's appeal allowed to the extent stated

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I set aside the decision not to make a fee award in this  case.  That  issue
will also have to be re-determined by the First-tier.
