                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of India  born  on  20  April  1987.   On  9
    February 2009 he arrived with leave to enter  as  a  student.   He  was
    granted further leave expiring on 13 December 2012 to remain as a  Tier
    1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant until 13 December 2012.  Before  expiry  of
    that leave, on 26 October 2012, he applied for further leave as a  Tier
    1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the Points-Based System.

 2. On 15 April 2013 the Respondent refused the application under paragraph
    245DD(b) of the Immigration Rules and by way of reference  to  Appendix
    A: Attributes because she was not satisfied the Appellant had shown  he
    had access to sufficient funds as required under the Immigration Rules.
      She  declined  to  consider  whether  the  Appellant  met  the  other
    requirements  of  the  Rules,  relying  on  paragraph  245DD(l).    The
    Respondent gave no other reasons in the notice of decision for refusing
    the application and went on to make a decision to remove the  Appellant
    by way of directions under Section 47 of the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.  It would appear from the Tribunal file that this
    decision followed an application by the  Appellant  for  permission  to
    bring judicial review proceedings which was settled by consent.

The original appeal and determination of the First-tier Tribunal

 3. On 29 April 2013 the Appellant lodged notice of appeal under Section 82
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  as  amended.   The
    grounds refer to the funds which the Appellant had available  and  that
    they were sufficient to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.
     The grounds also address the question of evidence of business activity
    with particular reference to information filed at Companies  House  and
    contracts for services offered by the Appellant's business.  They  also
    make a general non-specific  reference  to  the  jurisprudence  on  the
    review of the exercise or failure to exercise a  discretion  vested  in
    the Respondent in Ukus (discretion: when reviewable) [2012] UKUT  00307
    (IAC).

 4. By a determination promulgated on 6 February 2014 Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Warren Grant found the Appellant  had  correctly  claimed
    that he could show third party support to the extent of ï¿½50,000 and  so
    could meet the requirement for Access to  Funds  of  provision  (d)  of
    Table 4 of Appendix A.

 5. He went on to note the declaration signed by the  Appellant  and  those
    funding him did not disclose any  landline  telephone  number  for  the
    business but did show a mobile number.  He  appeared  not  to  consider
    this omission of as much importance as what he  subsequently  described
    as the significant omission from the declaration of an explanation  how
    the Appellant and those funding him were related, if at all.   He  went
    on to state he did not consider himself bound by  paragraph  245AAA  of
    the Immigration Rules.  I take this to  be  a  reference  to  paragraph
    245AA in relation to these matters.  He then addressed the Respondent's
    concern about the Appellant's failure to show that relevant information
    had been filed at Companies House.  In this respect he found:-

         In this case the receipt by the Respondent  of  an  application  to
         register should have triggered  either  an  internet  search  or  a
         request for further information under 245AAA  to  see  whether  the
         application to register had resulted (as one would normally expect)
         in an actual registration.

     Contrary to his earlier statement the Judge at this point  clearly  did
    consider paragraph 245AA of the Rules. Then, without  further  comment,
    he went on to dismiss the appeal in its entirety.

 6. The Appellant sought permission to appeal. The grounds are lengthy  and
    not all of them are applicable such as references to SSHD  v  Rodriguez
    [2014] EWCA Civ 2 and  the  complaints  in  paragraph  (vii)  that  the
    Respondent failed to make further enquiries. The grounds  make  generic
    references with citation of case law to the duty to  give  reasons  and
    what constitutes a material error of fact.   Generally,  they  fail  to
    focus  on  the  specific  treatment  of  the  appeal  in  the   Judge's
    determination.

 7. On 16 April 2014 Designated Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  French
    gave permission to appeal, noting the Judge had found in favour of  the
    Appellant in several respects and it was arguable he should have  found
    the Respondent was in error in failing to seek clarification  of  other
    matters under paragraph 245AA.  Further,  the  Judge  had  referred  at
    paragraph 11 to "two gaps in the evidence"  but  had  not  stated  what
    these were.  Additionally, he had failed to make an express finding  on
    the Respondent's refusal of the application because the  Appellant  had
    failed to produce contracts to show he was trading.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

 8. At the start of the hearing Mr Biggs  for  the  Appellant  submitted  a
    detailed and extensive  skeleton  argument  setting  out  the  relevant
    provisions  from  the  Immigration  Rules.    The   skeleton   argument
    identified the Judge's findings that the Appellant had  in  fact  shown
    access to sufficient funds as required  by  the  Rules.   This  finding
    showed the Respondent's decision had  been  made  on  the  basis  of  a
    material mistake of fact or failure to have regard to material matters.
    Consequently  the  Respondent  had  failed  lawfully  to  exercise  her
    discretion.  So, following the determination in Ukus, the Judge  should
    have found the Respondent's decision was not in accordance with the law
    and  have  remitted  the  matter  to   the   Respondent   for   further
    consideration.

 9. In  the  course  of  discussion  with  the  advocates,  I  indicated  I
    considered the reference made by the  Judge  in  paragraph  11  of  his
    determination to "two gaps in the evidence" was to the two omissions he
    had identified in paragraph  10  namely,  the  absence  of  a  landline
    telephone number and of evidence how those who signed  the  declaration
    were related, if at all.

10. Mr Biggs continued that the Respondent had not  taken  issue  with  the
    apparent lack of reference to a landline telephone number and the Judge
    should not have taken this point on  his  own  motion,  having  already
    found the decision in relation to Appendix A: Attributes  -  Access  to
    Funds to have been not in accordance  with  the  law.   Similarly,  the
    Respondent had not raised the point that the declaration did  not  show
    how those signing it were related or connected.

11. Further, the Judge had not addressed  the  Respondent's  concern  about
    lack of evidence of contracts detailing the services which the business
    offered. In any event the law on this had  been  clarified  (after  the
    hearing  before  the  Judge)  in   the   recent   decision   in   Shebl
    (Entrepreneur: proof of contracts) [2014] UKUT 216 (IAC).

12. I indicated to the parties  that  I  found  the  Judge's  determination
    contained a material error of law and accepted the  submissions  of  Mr
    Biggs in his skeleton argument and at the  hearing.  Having  found  the
    Respondent had made her decision on the basis of a  material  error  of
    fact the Judge should have concluded the decision was not in accordance
    with the law and remitted it.  Mr Nath for  the  Respondent  raised  no
    objection to proceeding on that basis.

13. Consequently, I find the First-tier Tribunal's determination  contained
    a material error of law in that having found the Respondent's  decision
    to have  been  based  on  a  material  error  of  fact  about  a  major
    requirement of the Immigration Rules for Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant
    applicants the Judge should have remitted the matter to the  Respondent
    for further consideration.

Anonymity

14. There was no request for an anonymity direction and  having  considered
    the appeal I find that none is required.

DECISION

     The First-tier Tribunal's determination contained a material  error  of
    law in that having found the Respondent's  original  decision  to  have
    been vitiated by a material error of fact the Judge  failed  adequately
    to deal with that finding by not concluding the  Respondent's  decision
    had been made other than in accordance with the Immigration  Rules  and
    the law and failed to remit the matter to the  Respondent  for  further
    consideration.

     The appeal of the Appellant is allowed to the limited extent  that  the
    whole matter including the issue of third party funds  is  remitted  to
    the Respondent for further consideration.

TO THE RESPONDENT: FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no fee award.
