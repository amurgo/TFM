                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a decision of Judge Holt (the  judge)  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (the  FtT)  promulgated  on  12th  April  2019,
    following a hearing which took place on 2nd January 2019.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan.  He claimed asylum in the UK on
    the basis that he is gay,  and  would  be  persecuted  if  returned  to
    Pakistan.  His application for international protection was refused  on
    4th July 2018 and he appealed to the FtT.

 3. The Appellant gave evidence before the FtT as did  three  witnesses  on
    his behalf.

 4. The judge found that one of the witnesses, Mr Ali, had  either  written
    the Appellant's witness statements or had a  very  close  influence  in
    their creation.  The judge recorded that  she  was  "suspicious  of  Mr
    Ali's role in the case generally, particularly given that I  was  aware
    that he had had a successful claim on the basis of being  found  to  be
    gay".

 5. The judge found, as was agreed by both parties, that the issue  in  the
    appeal was whether or not the Appellant is gay.  The Respondent's  case
    is that the Appellant  is  not  gay.   It  was  accepted  that  if  the
    Appellant is gay, he would be at risk in Pakistan.

 6. The judge found Mr  Ali  to  be  a  very  unimpressive  witness.   With
    reference to another witness called by the Appellant, Mr  Ahmed,  whose
    evidence was that the Appellant  is  gay,  the  judge  found  that  his
    evidence added nothing to the claim.  Evidence was  also  given  by  Mr
    Walker, described as the chairperson of an  organisation  called  Plus,
    which looks after the LGBT community.  The judge found that  Mr  Walker
    had accepted the Appellant's claim to be gay at "face value" and he had
    been duped by the Appellant.

 7. The judge found section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration  (Treatment  of
    Claimants, etc.) Act 2014 to be relevant noting that the Appellant  had
    been in the UK since May 2011 and that he had overstayed, and made  EEA
    applications to remain in the UK.  The Appellant had previously made an
    asylum application in 2015 without claiming to be gay.  The judge found
    the Appellant to have fabricated his claim to be gay and found  him  to
    be an economic migrant.  The appeal was dismissed on all grounds.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

 8. The Appellant relied upon four grounds.

 9. The first ground contends  the  judge  erred  in  taking  into  account
    irrelevant information and erred in  making  findings  in  relation  to
    demeanour.  The judge had at paragraph 16 referred to country  guidance
    case law on Iran and also made reference to further case law on Iran at
    paragraph 17.  This was not relevant to the Appellant's case.

10. The judge had commented upon the demeanour of Mr  Ali  noting  that  he
    positioned himself so that he  could  see  the  Appellant  when  giving
    evidence and the judge formed the impression  that  the  Appellant  was
    nodding when Mr Ali answered questions.  The judge at paragraph 23 made
    reference to the Appellant "nodding in a way that suggested  indication
    of an affirmative answer to the first key questions."  It was submitted
    that the judge had failed to particularise what the first key questions
    were, or what  material  advantage  the  Appellant  gleaned  from  this
    conduct.  It was contended the judge had acted irrationally in  placing
    reliance on this issue.  In addition this was not raised  at  the  time
    with the Appellant or Counsel which was unfair.

11. It was submitted that the judge had not put to the Appellant,  Mr  Ali,
    or Counsel concerns about  Mr  Ali  being  involved  in  preparing  the
    Appellant's witness statement.  It was submitted this was unfair.

12. It was submitted that the judge had taken into  account  an  irrelevant
    issue when describing Mr Ali's claim for asylum (which was  successful)
    as being very similar to the Appellant's.

13. The second ground related to the judge's finding  in  relation  to  the
    Appellant's sexuality.  It was contended that at paragraph 25 the judge
    identified "another key reason" to reject the relationship between  the
    Appellant and Mr Ali but failed to give adequate reasons for this.  The
    judge in that paragraph described the relationship between Mr  Ali  and
    the Appellant as being "presented as being about little more than  sex,
    apart from occasional  trips  to  Costa  Coffee.   This  did  not  ring
    remotely true."  The judge had not explained this finding.

14. Ground three contends that the judge irrationally rejected the evidence
    of supporting witnesses.  The judge at  paragraph  31  found  that  the
    evidence of Mr Ahmed  "added  nothing  to  the  claims."   No  adequate
    explanation had been given by the judge to explain that.

15. The judge found that the witness Mr Walker  had  been  "duped"  by  the
    Appellant and discounted his evidence because of the "other  evidence".
    The judge had not particularised what the "other evidence" was and  had
    not assessed the supporting witness evidence in the round.

16. The fourth ground relates to  section  8  of  the  2004  Act.   It  was
    submitted  that  the  judge  had  started  considering  credibility  by
    considering section 8 which was contrary to the guidance  given  in  JT
    (Cameroon) [2008] EWCA Civ 878.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

17. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Scott-Baker in the  following
    terms;

         "The first ground arguably has  no  material  substance.   However,
         reading the determination as a whole it is arguable, based  on  the
         grounds, that the FtT Judge had been procedurally unfair in failing
         to put concerns as to the behaviour of the witness to the Appellant
         at the hearing.  It is also arguable that the judge failed to  give
         appropriate weight to the evidence of the witnesses and also failed
         to arguably give adequate reasons."

18. Following the grant of permission directions  were  issued  that  there
    should be an oral  hearing  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  ascertain
    whether the FtT had erred in law such that the  decision  must  be  set
    aside.





My Analysis and Conclusions

19. At the oral hearing before me Mr O'Ryan expanded upon  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal.  He did not pursue Ground one, nor Ground four.

20. Mr McVeety accepted that the judge  had  erred  at  paragraph  25  when
    describing the relationship  between  the  Appellant  and  Mr  Ali  but
    contended that this error was not material,  and  the  judge  had  made
    numerous  sustainable  findings  which  entitled  her  to   reach   the
    conclusion that the Appellant was incredible, and the  witnesses  could
    not be relied upon.

21. Mr O'Ryan was clearly correct not to pursue Ground one.  There  was  no
    need for the judge to  set  out  case  law  in  relation  to  Iran  and
    conversion to Christianity. However this was not relevant to the issues
    before the judge, and did not amount to a material error of law.

22. Mr O'Ryan was also correct not to rely upon Ground four.   In  my  view
    the challenge made in the grounds on section  8  of  the  2004  Act  is
    misconceived and unfair.  When considering section 8 of  the  2004  Act
    the judge referred to SM (Iran) [2005] UKAIT 00116, when  it  may  have
    been more appropriate to refer to JT (Cameroon) [2008]  EWCA  Civ  878,
    but correctly gave a self-direction, that where section  8  applies,  a
    judge should look at the evidence as a whole, and  decide  which  parts
    are more important and which are less, and section 8 does  not  require
    the behaviour to which it applies to be treated as the  starting  point
    of the assessment of credibility.

23. I am however persuaded that the judge did materially err in law in  the
    following ways.

24. It was accepted on behalf of the  Respondent  that  the  conclusion  in
    paragraph 25 was not sustainable.  For ease  of  reference  I  set  out
    paragraph 25 below;

         "25. Another key reason what  (sic)  I  am  not  satisfied  by  the
             alleged relationship between the Appellant and Mr Ali is  that
             there were scant  details  of  friendship,  affection,  shared
             interests  or  any  of  the  facets  of  a   normal   intimate
             relationship, despite having gone on  for  over  seven  months
             now.  The relationship was presented  as  being  about  little
             more than sex, apart from occasional trips  to  Costa  Coffee.
             This did not ring remotely true.  Rather, the  supposedly  key
             relationship that purported to prove that the Appellant  is  a
             real gay man was presented as a one dimensional clich� of  gay
             life, a stereotypical  gay  relationship,  as  gay  men  being
             promiscuous and only interested in sexual encounters  and  Gay
             Pride.  The description of the  purportedly  key  relationship
             was lacking in any of the nuanced, subtle details  of  a  real
             human relationship,  especially  one  that  had  lasted  seven
             months or so."

25. I find there is  a  lack  of  reasoning  for  the  conclusion  reached.
    Witness statements had been made by the  Appellant  and  Mr  Ali.   The
    Appellant's witness statement commences at page 14 of  the  Appellant's
    bundle before the FtT and in paragraph  27  he  describes  starting  to
    sleep together with Mr Ali in  mid-June  2018.   He  further  describes
    going to Costa Coffee in Manchester and sometimes meeting at  his  home
    but more often outside.  The concluding sentence is "We are  physically
    involved only but I don't know if it will go  anywhere  as  Ali  enjoys
    casual sexual relations."

26. Mr Ali's witness statement is at page 22 of the Appellant's bundle that
    was before the FtT and in paragraph 11 the concluding sentence is,  "We
    are physically involved only but I don't know if it will go anywhere as
    I enjoy casual sexual relations."  The evidence of the Appellant and Mr
    Ali was therefore that they had a limited relationship, but what is not
    explained by the judge is why that does "not ring remotely true".

27. I do find this to be a material error.  It is unclear to  a  reader  of
    the decision why the relationship described by both the  Appellant  and
    Mr Ali is not accepted.

28. I find a material error of law in the judge's treatment of the evidence
    of Mr Ahmed.  The judge deals with this at paragraph 31 concluding that
    paragraph with the following sentence, "I found that his evidence added
    nothing to the claims."  Mr Ahmed's witness statement confirmed that he
    had known the Appellant for approximately a year at the  date  he  made
    his statement.  He had met him many times particularly at  LGBT  social
    gatherings.  He believed the Appellant to be gay.  He expressly  stated
    at paragraph 7 of his statement that he had seen him  at  a  particular
    club and seen him regularly with Mr Ali.  He said that he had seen  the
    Appellant and Mr Ali to be very physical with one another at  Mr  Ali's
    house.  At paragraph 8  of  his  witness  statement  he  described  the
    Appellant and Mr Ali as often kissing each other.

29. The judge has not explained why evidence couched  in  the  above  terms
    adds nothing to the Appellant's claim to be gay.  If the evidence given
    by Mr Ahmed was to be rejected, reasons must be given for not accepting
    that evidence.  There were no such reasons given.  The judge  commented
    at paragraph 31 that Mr Ahmed  was  vague  about  where  the  Appellant
    lived, but Mr Ahmed's evidence was that he had seen the  Appellant  and
    Mr Ali at Mr Ali's house, not at the Appellant's house.

30. I am persuaded that the judge materially erred  in  making  an  adverse
    finding when recording that (at paragraph 21) "It is striking that this
    Appellant's claims appear to be very similar to Mr Ali's  in  terms  of
    groups that the Appellant has been attending since identifying  as  gay
    (more of which below) and enthusiastic attendance at Gay Pride events."

31. The judge did have a copy of Mr Ali's successful appeal  decision  made
    by Designated Judge McClure.  In that decision at paragraph  66,  Judge
    McClure specifically considered whether Mr Ali's activities were just a
    front created to support an asylum claim.  He noted there was  a  group
    of individuals claiming asylum on the basis of sexuality  all  of  whom
    had the same ethnic origin.  Judge McClure's conclusion  was  that  the
    activities were not a front and he did not find it unusual that  people
    with the same cultural background were able  to  meet  by  use  of  the
    internet and contact others with similar experiences.  The finding made
    by Judge McClure is of course not binding upon the judge, but does  not
    appear to have been considered.

32. I find that the judge erred in not attaching any weight to Mr  Walker's
    evidence.  The judge accepted Mr Walker to be  a  sincere  witness  but
    took the view that he had been duped by the Appellant because  of  "all
    the other evidence in the  case"  (paragraph  33).   I  find  that  the
    judge's consideration of that other evidence, is  legally  flawed,  and
    therefore the judge has not  given  adequate  reasons  for  placing  no
    weight upon the evidence of Mr Walker.

33. The decision of the FtT is comprehensive and  has  been  prepared  with
    care.  However for the reasons given above, I find that  it  is  unsafe
    and must be set aside.

34. Both representatives agreed  that  if  I  found  an  error  of  law  as
    contended by the Appellant, it  would  be  appropriate  to  remit  this
    appeal to the FtT to be heard again.

35. I have considered  paragraph  7  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Statements and find that it is appropriate to remit the appeal back  to
    the FtT because of the nature and extent of judicial fact-finding  that
    will be necessary in order for this decision to be remade.

36. The parties will be advised of the time and date of the FtT hearing  in
    due course.  The appeal is to be heard by an FtT Judge other than Judge
    Holt.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT involved the making of an error of law such that  it
is set aside.  The appeal is allowed to the extent that it  is  remitted  to
the FtT with no findings of fact preserved.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
