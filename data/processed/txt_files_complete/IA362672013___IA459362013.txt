Representation:
For the claimants:     Mr T Rahman, instructed by Kings Court Chambers
For the appellant:     Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimants, Guang Hug, date of birth 14.4.84, and his wife, Jing Li,
    date of birth 4.2.72, are citizens of China.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Amin  promulgated  16.9.14  allowing  the
    claimants' linked appeals against the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State to refuse their applications for leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) migrant and dependant, and to remove them from the UK by
    way of directions under  section  47  of  the  Immigration  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006. The Judge heard the appeal on 1.9.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Holmes  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    27.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 27.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Amin should be set aside. For  the
    reasons set out below, I find that the decision was flawed  and  cannot
    stand as it involved a number of errors of law.

 6. As this is a PBS case, in relation  to  the  Tier  1  application,  the
    Tribunal can only consider under section 85A(4) evidence  submitted  in
    support and at the time of making the application under  consideration.
    Post-application evidence cannot be accepted, except where it meets the
    requirements of paragraph 245AA.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Holmes pointed out that it  was
    conceded by the first claimant that his application did  not  meet  the
    strict evidential requirements of paragraph 41-SD  of  Appendix  A.  In
    particular, the Secretary of State pointed out that  the  advertisement
    submitted by the first claimant did not bear his name. For that  reason
    alone, the appeal was bound to be refused under the Immigration  Rules.
    Secondly, the �50,000 business funds relied on by  the  first  claimant
    was in an ISA, which is specifically  excluded  under  41-SD9a)(ii)(3).
    The money has to be in cash and not in an Individual  Savings  Account,
    or assets should as stocks and shares.

 8. The First-tier Tribunal Judge appears  to  have  mistakenly  considered
    that there is a discretion in  the  Tribunal  to  dispense  with  these
    evidential requirements. That was an error of law. It matters not  that
    there might be good business reasons or what  advice  was  given  about
    whether to  include  the  name  of  the  Tier  1  entrepreneur  on  the
    advertisement, the requirement is that it must be included.   As  Judge
    Holmes stated, "It was not for the respondent or the judge to  seek  to
    rectify the omissions in the evidence filed with  the  application,  or
    for the appeal; Durrani, Fayyaz and  Akhter  [2014]  UKU  295-297.  Nor
    could the deficiencies in the documents submitted with the  application
    be saved by the application of paragraph 245AA; Rodriguez  [2014]  EWCA
    Civ 2."

 9. I reject Mr Rahman's  rather  poor  argument  that  because  the  first
    claimant is the sole director of the business and that the company name
    was on the advertisement it can be concluded that he had  substantially
    complied with the requirement. The  claimants  only  had  to  read  the
    requirements to know what had to be in the advertisement  to  meet  the
    evidential requirement.

10. In relation to the refusal based  on  lack  of  funds,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge erred in stating that the respondent's decision was "not
    in accordance with the law." It that had  been  the  case  the  correct
    course would have been to allow the appeal to the limited  extent  that
    it remained for the Secretary of State to make a decision  that  is  in
    accordance with the law. However, the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State was entirely in accordance with the law. Even  if  there  was  no
    clear explanation in the refusal decision as to why the funds were  not
    acceptable, it remains the case that the  funds  in  an  ISA  were  not
    acceptable and no amount of explanation could have changed  that  fact,
    especially since the evidence had to be submitted with the application.
    There was no way to cure the defect. Thus whilst  it  would  have  been
    better for a clear explanation to  be  provided,  the  application  was
    fatally  flawed.  In  considering  the  evidence  of  funds  a   simple
    examination of the relevant requirements clearly states that ISA  funds
    are not acceptable, but the First-tier Tribunal Judge did not appear to
    appreciate that.

11. In the circumstances, it is clear both that the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal was  flawed  and  that  once  the  application  had  been
    submitted it was doomed to failure under the Immigration Rules.

12. In relation to article 8 ECHR, I note that it although it was raised in
    the grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, it was not pursued at
    the appeal hearing except by Mr Rahman's very short submission  on  the
    first claimant's family life in the UK, which  was  referenced  by  the
    judge at �18 and again at �25, where it was described  as  not  pursued
    with much vigour.

13. There has been no cross-appeal by the  claimants  against  the  judge's
    decision not to address article 8. Having informed the  representatives
    that I had found such error of law in the decision that I was going  to
    set it aside but proceed to remake it immediately, consistent with  the
    directions to the parties, I invited Mr  Rahman  to  make  any  further
    submissions he wished. He told me that he had nothing further to say.

14. It is clear, without having to go into the  detail  of  the  provisions
    that under Appendix FM neither claimant nor  their  son  can  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules for leave to remain on the  basis  of  family
    life. In relation to private life and  paragraph  276ADE,  nothing  has
    been put forward to suggest that they have  lost  all  ties  to  China,
    including family, social and cultural. Thus they do not meet the  Rules
    for either family or private life.

15. Nothing has been put before me to suggest  that  there  are  compelling
    circumstances insufficiently recognised in the Rules so as to  justify,
    exceptionally, allowing the appeal under private and/or family  grounds
    of article 8 ECHR on the  basis  that  the  decision  is  unjustifiably
    harsh.

16. However, Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE have been held not  to  be  a
    complete code for consideration of article 8 private  and  family  life
    rights and in the light of section 86 of the 2002 Act I consider that I
    am required to consider article 8 ECHR.

17. Although case law on this  issue  continues  to  develop,  the  current
    position is perhaps best expressed in paragraph 135 of R(MM  (Lebanon))
    v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985:

         "135.  Where the relevant group of IRs  [immigration  rules],  upon
         their proper construction provide a  "complete  code"  for  dealing
         with a person's Convention rights in the context of a particular IR
         or statutory provision, such as in the case of "foreign criminals",
         then the balancing exercise and the way the various factors are  to
         be taken into account  in  an  individual  case  must  be  done  in
         accordance with  that  code,  although  reference  to  "exceptional
         circumstances"   in   the   code   will   nonetheless   entail    a
         proportionality exercise.  But if the relevant group of IRs is  not
         such a "complete code" then the proportionality test will  be  more
         at large, albeit guided by the Huang tests and  UK  and  Strasbourg
         case law."

18. I also bear in mind that the threshold to engage article  8(1)  is  not
    particularly high (see VW (Uganda) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 5).

19.  In the circumstances, and applying the Razgar five step tests, I  find
    for the reasons set out  herein  that  the  decision  does  not  engage
    article 8 family life.

20. Even if it did, the crucial  issue  is  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise between on the one hand the rights of the claimants and  their
    child and on the other the legitimate and necessary aim of the state to
    protect the economic well-being of the UK through immigration  control,
    which under section 117B of the 2002 Act is in the public interest. The
    decision may potential interfere with or interrupt their  private  life
    established in the UK with friends and associates. However, the sort of
    interference occasioned by the refusal  decision  does  not  materially
    affect their physical or moral integrity and cases such  as  Nasim  and
    Patel have held that the sort of private life enjoyed  by  students  in
    the UK does not engage article 8 ECHR.

21. In Nasim and others (article 8) [2014]  UKUT  00025  (IAC),  the  Upper
    Tribunal considered whether the hypothetical  removal  of  the  22  PBS
    claimants, pursuant to the decision to  refuse  to  vary  leave,  would
    violate the UK's obligations under article 8  ECHR.  Whilst  each  case
    must  be  determined  on  its  merits,  the  Tribunal  noted  that  the
    judgements of the Supreme Court in Patel and Others v SSHD [2013]  UKSC
    72, "serve to re-focus attention on the nature and purpose of article 8
    of the ECHR and, in particular, to  recognise  that  article's  limited
    utility in private life cases that are far removed from the  protection
    of an individual's moral and physical  integrity."  The  claimants  can
    continue  their  friendships  from  China  through  modern   means   of
    communication.

22. Although the claimants have a son born in the UK, none  of  the  family
    are British citizens or settled in the UK. Whilst I have to have regard
    to the best interests of the child, he was born in 2012 and  thus  will
    have no concept of life outside the family unit. He has no  significant
    private life outside the family. The family will  be  removed  together
    and thus will be able to continue family life in China. No credible  or
    satisfactory reason has been proffered as to why they cannot return  to
    China or that there would be serious difficulties in doing so.  In  the
    circumstances, it is clear that the decision is not disproportionate.

23. As Judge Holmes noted in the grant  of  permission,  "Arguably  if  the
    judge had gone on to consider the appellants' article 8 rights he would
    have been bound to find that the evidence relied upon did not establish
    that the removal of the family as  a  unit  would  interfere  in  their
    ability to pursue their "family life" together. Moreover, he  would  be
    bound to find that the appellants had failed to provide any evidence to
    show that either of them had established in the UK a "private life"  of
    sufficient substance to render disproportionate the decision to  remove
    them." I entirely concur with that opinion  and  I  have  set  out  the
    reasons why that is so.

24. I accordingly find that the claimants do not meet all the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules. Neither is the decision of the  Secretary  of
    State to remove them from the UK disproportionate to their private  and
    family life rights under article 8 ECHR.



Conclusions:

25. For the reasons set out above, I find that he making of the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making of an error on  a  point
    of law such that the decision should be set aside and remade.  Pursuant
    to the directions issued to the  parties  I  proceeded  to  remake  the
    appeal immediately by dismissing it on all grounds for the reasons  set
    out above.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by  dismissing  the
                    appeal of each claimant.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal of each claimant has been dismissed and thus  there  can
be no fee award.
