                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1) This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision by Judge
    of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Metzer  allowing  an  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  The appellant before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    hereinafter referred to as "the applicant".

 2) The relevant background is set out in the decision of the Judge of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  The applicant entered the  UK  as  a  student  in
    September 2004.  An application  for  further  leave  to  remain  as  a
    student was rejected in 2009 but granted later in the same year.   This
    leave expired in November 2009 and in April 2010 the applicant made  an
    out of time application for leave  to  remain.   This  application  was
    rejected as were two subsequent  ones.   In  June  2011,  however,  the
    applicant was given leave to remain for two  years  as  a  spouse.   An
    application made in June 2013 for further leave to remain  was  refused
    and a subsequent appeal was unsuccessful.  A further  application  made
    in 2014 was then also rejected.  In October 2014 the applicant  applied
    for indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  the  basis  of  10  years'  long
    residence.  This application was  refused  in  February  2015  and  the
    refusal decision gave rise to the present appeal.

 3) In his evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal  the  applicant  stated
    that he met his wife in  2008.   They  married  in  August  2015  after
    cohabiting for two years.  His wife became pregnant but they  lost  the
    child.

 4) The applicant works as a pharmacy technician and has been with the same
    employer for over four years.  His current salary is about ï¿½25,000  per
    year.

 5) The applicant has no family in Nigeria.  His father  died  in  December
    2012 and his mother and sister live in the USA.  The applicant's wife's
    family live in the UK.  The applicant's childhood friends  are  now  in
    the UK having left Nigeria.  The applicant said that his wife would not
    go with him to Nigeria  if  he  were  to  be  removed  there.   She  is
    currently undertaking teacher training, due to  be  completed  in  July
    2016.  His wife was not aware of his immigration status when they first
    met but he thought she became aware about a year afterwards.

 6) The applicant's wife gave evidence before the First-tier Tribunal.  She
    arrived in the UK in May 2007 from Nigeria.  She is a British national.
     She has a  degree  and  is  undertaking  postgraduate  training  as  a
    teacher.  Although the applicant's wife lived in Nigeria  in  the  past
    she no longer has any family or friends there and she  has  adapted  to
    life in the UK.  She visited Nigeria once in 2011 or 2012.  She did not
    know the applicant's immigration status when they first met  but  found
    out about it about two years ago.  She would not go to Nigeria with him
    as she has no family or friends there and would not be able to continue
    with her studies.

 7) It seems to have been recognised before the  First-tier  Tribunal  that
    the applicant could not succeed under the 10  years  rule,  principally
    because his lawful residence was not continuous.  There were  246  days
    when the applicant was in the UK without leave.  Before carrying out  a
    proportionality assessment under Article 8 the Judge of the  First-tier
    Tribunal had regard to paragraph 276ADE(vi) of the  Immigration  Rules,
    which refers to the issue of whether there  will  be  very  significant
    obstacles to a person's integration into their country of origin.  With
    this in mind the judge noted that the applicant arrived in  the  UK  in
    September 2004 and had not returned to Nigeria since then.  He met  his
    wife in 2008 and has lived with her for around 3 years.

 8) The judge accepted that the applicant has no family ties to Nigeria  as
    his father has died and his mother and sister have emigrated.  Although
    his wife was originally from Nigeria she is a British citizen  and  has
    severed her ties with Nigeria.  She has made  her  life  here  together
    with members of her family.  She is undertaking teacher training in the
    UK with a view to a career here.  It would not be reasonable to  expect
    her to travel to Nigeria were the applicant required to leave  the  UK.
    The judge accepted the applicant's evidence that he has nowhere to live
    and nobody left in Nigeria and he has  made  the  UK  his  home  for  a
    considerable period of over 11 years.  During this time he has obtained
    qualifications and good employment.  He  has  married  and  has  become
    integrated.  There were very significant obstacles to  the  applicant's
    integration back into Nigeria.

 9) In the application for permission to  appeal  the  Secretary  of  State
    submitted that the judge misdirected  himself  in  law  by  failing  to
    consider the appeal under the  Immigration  Rules.   According  to  the
    Secretary  of  State's  refusal  letter  of   25   February   2015   no
    representations were made by the applicant in relation to  family  life
    in the UK.  The applicant married  some  6  months  after  the  refusal
    letter but it was incumbent on the judge to consider the  appeal  under
    Appendix FM and  Appendix  FM-SE  and  consider  whether  the  relevant
    requirements of  these  provisions  were  met.   The  judge  failed  to
    consider the relevant Immigration Rules before considering  the  appeal
    outside the Rules.

10) It was further submitted on behalf of the Secretary of State  that  the
    judge failed to give adequate reasons for finding that there  would  be
    very significant obstacles to the applicant returning to Nigeria.   The
    applicant was brought up in Nigeria and came to the UK at  the  age  of
    28.  While he has no family there, he is a Nigerian  national  with  no
    health problems.  He is well-educated with a history of employment.  He
    has the ability to speak the  local  languages  and  is  aware  of  the
    culture.  The judge had not taken these matters into account.

11) The judge further erred, accordingly to  the  Secretary  of  State,  by
    finding that it would be  unreasonable  for  the  applicant's  wife  to
    return with the applicant  to  Nigeria  as  this  would  interrupt  her
    studies.  The applicant's wife arrived in the UK from Nigeria  in  2007
    after spending her childhood and a portion of  her  adult  life  there.
    The judge's finding on this point was irrational.  The  judge  did  not
    take into account that the relationship was created at  a  time  either
    when the applicant's status was precarious or he  had  no  leave.   The
    judge failed to have regard to the public interest as set  out  in  the
    relevant legislation and Immigration Rules.

12) Permission to appeal was granted  on  the  basis  that  the  judge  had
    arguably erred in law in relation to these issues.

Submissions

13) At the hearing Mr Avery addressed me with regard to the grounds of  the
    application.  On the question of the reasonableness  of  expecting  the
    applicant's wife to accompany  him  to  Nigeria,  he  referred  to  the
    decision in Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ 440.  The judge did not have regard
    to section 117B of the 2002 Act as amended.  The judge's  approach  was
    fundamentally flawed and he failed  to  properly  consider  the  public
    interest.

14)  For  the  applicant,  Mr  Glass  referred  to  the  findings  on   the
    relationship  between  the  applicant  and  his  wife  and   on   their
    qualifications.  The maintenance requirement in Appendix  FM  was  more
    than satisfied.  The applicant's wife was now working as  an  assistant
    teacher.  It was accepted that this was a  durable  relationship.   The
    requirements of Appendix FM were satisfied even if the  judge  had  not
    flagged this up as such.  The applicant has had his whole career in the
    UK context.  He had no family to return to.

15) Mr Glass further stated that section 117B was not raised at the hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal.  The  judge  found  in  favour  of  the
    applicant under the proportionality test.

16) Mr Avery responded by saying  that  whether  or  not  Appendix  FM  was
    flagged up the judge needed to address this before Article 8.   Without
    doing so he could not form a proper view under Article  8.   The  judge
    relied on very significant obstacles to re-integration into Nigeria  as
    reasons why the applicant should stay.  These were not reasons  why  he
    should  not  return.   The  judge  had  no  regard  to  the   statutory
    considerations and failed to consider the public interest.

Discussion

17) I find there are a number of problems arising from the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  One might question, first of all, why  the  judge
    stated as the final decision that the  appeal  was  allowed  under  the
    Immigration Rules when  the  reasoning  shows  that  the  decision  was
    allowed under Article 8.  This point was not raised in the  application
    for permission to appeal but it is an obvious anomaly.

18) I would be less concerned about the lack of any reference  to  Appendix
    FM if the judge  had  more  fully  set  out  reasons  relating  to  the
    applicant's private and family life in the UK as to why  he  should  be
    allowed to remain.  Instead of doing this  the  judge  concentrated  on
    what were perceived as very significant obstacles to the applicant's re-
    integration into Nigeria.  As the Secretary of State has  pointed  out,
    where the applicant is comparatively  young,  well-educated  and  well-
    qualified young man in good health, it seems difficult to suppose  that
    the absence of near relatives means that he could not re-integrate into
    Nigeria.  The criticisms made of the judge's reasoning by the Secretary
    of State in this matter go  beyond  what  might  be  regarded  as  mere
    disagreement into the field of adequacy and validity, where the  narrow
    approach taken by the judge does indicate that the  balancing  exercise
    has been given less than adequate consideration.

19) In stating this I do not wish to express a view as to whether it  would
    be reasonable to expect  the  applicant's  wife  to  accompany  him  to
    Nigeria or what obstacles the applicant himself might face in returning
    there.  The problem with the decision of the Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is not so much in the findings which  were  made  but  in  the
    matters which were seemingly left out  of  account,  at  least  to  the
    extent that they were not stated and expressed in  the  way  that  they
    should have been.

20) A further matter of concern is that  the  judge  had  had  no  apparent
    regard to section 117B of the  2002  Act,  as  amended.   In  terms  of
    section 117A the provisions of section 117B must be taken into  account
    in an appeal under the Immigration Acts where a  breach  of  Article  8
    rights to private or family life is alleged.   Nevertheless  the  judge
    gave no consideration to the  application  of  section  117B(1),  which
    states that the maintenance of effective immigration control is in  the
    public interest.  The judge did not consider section 117B(4), at  least
    to the extent to which that might be relevant, nor section 117B(5).

21) In this regard it may be noted that the applicant's last leave  expired
    in June 2013 although an appeal against a refusal of  leave  to  remain
    was not finally determined until December 2014.  It appears  also  that
    the applicant had no leave between the end of  November  2009  and  the
    beginning of April 2010.   Given  the  applicant's  varied  immigration
    history, it was incumbent upon the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  to
    make very clear findings about when the applicant's  relationship  with
    his wife was formed and what her state of knowledge was  at  the  time.
    In the circumstances of this appeal the judge erred by not doing so.

22) There was some discussion at the hearing before me of the proper  means
    for re-making the decision.  I consider that  the  appropriate  course,
    given the inadequacy of the judge's findings, would be for  the  appeal
    to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for the decision  to  be  re-
    made at a hearing before a different judge with no findings preserved.

Conclusions

23) The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

24) I set aside the decision.

25) I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to be remade at a hearing
    before a different judge with no findings preserved.

Anonymity

26) The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order for  anonymity.   I  have
    not been asked to make such an order and I see no reason  of  substance
    for doing so.
