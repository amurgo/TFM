Representation:
For Md Ashraf Hossain: Mr I Ahmed of Auua Law Solicitors
For the SSHD: Mr C Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONs

      1. Mr Hossain sought leave to remain on the basis of his  family  life
         with his settled partner and British  child.  He  was  refused  for
         reasons set out in a decision of the respondent dated 13th February
         2018 on the grounds, in summary, that he had relied  upon  a  TOEIC
         certificate from ETS which was taken at Synergy Business College on
         24th November 2011; the result of that test had been  withdrawn  by
         ETS and declared "questionable" and that,  following  an  interview
         with a representative of the SSHD, the SSHD was satisfied  that  he
         had  fraudulently  obtained  his  certificate  and  that  he   used
         deception in his application for leave to remain.

      2. Mr Hossain  appealed  and,  for  reasons  set  out  in  a  decision
         promulgated on 20th July  2018,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Kelly
         allowed his appeal.

      3. In a short decision, judge Kelly found

             7.   The evidence relied upon by the respondent, taken at  its
             highest,  shows  that   the   appellant's   test   result   is
             "questionable" .... The only reason for this somewhat  limited
             finding appears to be that a  high  percentage  of  the  other
             tests taken at the centre that day are  proved  to  have  been
             taken by proxy. It is  on  this  basis  alone  that  ETS  have
             declared  the  appellant's  own  test   "invalid".   This   is
             notwithstanding the lack of any  direct  evidence  to  suggest
             that  he  employed  fraud.  This  is  not  in  my  judgment  a
             sufficient basis for proving on  a  balance  of  probabilities
             that the appellant took his test by proxy. It at most casts  a
             cloud of suspicion over the result. I am  therefore  satisfied
             that the appellant does not, so to  speak,  have  a  'case  to
             answer'. It follows  from  this  that  he  does  not  bear  an
             evidential burden of providing an "innocent  explanation"  for
             that of which there is little or no evidence to begin with. It
             is right to say that  there  were  certain  anomalies  in  the
             appellant's testimony concerning  matters  extraneous  to  the
             test in question, such as precisely  how  many  times  he  had
             previously  failed.   The   appellant   put   this   down   to
             misunderstandings during  an  interview  with  a  Home  Office
             official that took place on the 27th June 2016. However in  my
             judgement none of these anomalies  assist  the  respondent  in
             discharging the legal burden of  proving  that  the  appellant
             employed fraud on the day in question.

             8.   The respondent has not discharged the burden  of  proving
             on a balance of  probabilities  that  the  appellant  employed
             fraud as claimed. It follows that the public interest does not
             require the appellant's removal under section 117B(6)  of  the
             2002 Act.

      4. As agreed between the parties, the First-tier Tribunal judge failed
         to carry  out  the  full  task  required.  The  SSHD  had  provided
         sufficient information and evidence to 'shift' the burden of  proof
         such that the First-tier Tribunal judge should have made a  finding
         on whether the explanation and evidence given  by  Mr  Hossain  was
         such as to enable a finding that he had taken the test  as  claimed
         rather than find that the SSHD had  not  proved  on  a  balance  of
         probabilities that Mr Hossain had employed  deception.  Mr  Hossain
         was asked questions, in English, both at interview  with  the  Home
         Office on 27th June 2016 and at the appeal hearing - the judge just
         did not follow that through with a finding.

      5. It follows that, as agreed with the parties, the  judge  materially
         erred in law and the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  judge  is
         set aside to be remade.

      6. I heard submissions from both parties on the re-making. There was a
         full note of evidence in the file,  taken  by  First-tier  Tribunal
         judge Kelly and both parties, having seen and considered that  note
         of evidence, were content for me  to  take  that  into  account  in
         reaching my decision. Both parties confirmed that there was no need
         for oral evidence; Mr Bates confirmed he  did  not  seek  to  cross
         examine Mr Hossain being content to rely upon the evidence  already
         before me.

      7. In reaching my decision I  have  taken  account  of  the  interview
         record with the Home Office  on  27th  June  2016,  the  background
         material and statistical detail relied upon by the Home  Office  in
         reaching their decision, the note of evidence taken  by  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Kelly, the decision the subject of the  appeal,  the
         witness statement of Mr Hossain and the submissions  made  on  18th
         December 2018.

      8. Mr Hossain's language certificate was declared invalid by ETS after
         investigation of results from Synergy  Business  College  where  he
         took the test.  His  test  result  was  considered  "questionable".
         Between 24th November 2011 and  15th  January  2013,  49%  of  test
         results from Synergy were considered to be  invalid  and  51%  were
         considered questionable. There were no test results  recorded  that
         did not fall into one or other of those two categories.  On the day
         on which Mr Hossain took his test, there was a spike in the  number
         of results considered to be invalid to  65%  and  those  that  were
         questionable were 35%. Again, there were none  that  did  not  fall
         within one or other of those two categories.

      9. According to  the  report  Project  Faï¿½ade  into  Synergy  Business
         College, those individuals with 'questionable' test results were to
         're-test'. Mr Hossain did not  re-test.  He  was  not  offered  the
         opportunity to re-test by the Home  Office  and,  despite  requests
         made by his solicitors for the return of his passport to enable him
         to organise a test on his own  initiative,  his  passport  was  not
         returned to him. He was thus unable to book a test.

     10. Included in the bundle were four test results:

             15th August 2011  listening 140;/495 reading 105/495

             16th August 2011  speaking 80/200; reading 20/200

             14th November 2011     listening 495/495; reading 445/495

             24th November 2011     speaking 150/200; writing 150/200

         It is clear from these results that his  overall  language  ability
         improved significantly over three months.

     11.  The  interview  on  27th  June  2016  was  conducted  without   an
         interpreter. It was almost five years after the tests  in  November
         2011 and the answers given by Mr Hossain are  vague  in  the  sense
         that he provides answers to the  questions  asked  but  says  on  a
         number of occasions that he cannot recall exactly the cost  of  the
         test and other details. Such lack of recall  would  be  significant
         for something that had occurred in the recent past but an inability
         to recall exactly how long a test took,  how  many  questions  were
         asked, or the cost does not impact adversely  where  the  questions
         relate to an event some five years previously.

     12. The interviewer did not put to Mr Hossain that the responses to the
         questions did not accord with  a  test  that  he  was  required  to
         undertake in order to obtain the certificate he was given. Nor  was
         he asked how his scores had improved so dramatically in only  three
         months. It is not apparent from the record of the interview that Mr
         Hossain had any difficulty  at  all  either  in  understanding  the
         questions asked or in providing coherent and clear answers  to  the
         questions asked. The decision letter makes no significant reference
         to the interview or why the interview failed  to  remedy  what  was
         considered by the Home Office to be a questionable test result.

     13. Mr Hossain gave evidence  in  English  before  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge Kelly. It is not apparent from the note of that hearing  that
         he  had  any  difficulty  understanding  the  questions  asked   or
         communicating his answers in fluent English. He was not  asked  why
         there was a difference  between  the  results  in  August  and  the
         results in November. It was not put to him that his recollection of
         the format of the test was not consistent with a format that  would
         have led to a non-questionable test result. It was not in fact  put
         to him that he had used a proxy, but it can be inferred  that  this
         was the purpose of the questioning.

     14. In reaching my decision my starting point  is  that  the  SSHD  has
         shown sufficient evidence to require Mr Hossain to provide evidence
         to satisfy me, on the balance of probabilities, that  he  took  the
         test as he claims. Adverse to Mr Hossain is the fact that his  test
         scores from Synergy College showed a significant  unexplained  leap
         over a short period of time. That was not put to him and I can only
         infer that the Home Office did not  consider  it  significant.  The
         college where he took the  test  has  had  no  valid  test  results
         recorded; his own  score  was  questionable.  As  the  Home  Office
         documents state, questionable includes not only those where the use
         of a proxy was  suspected  but  also  where  there  had  been  test
         administration irregularity and where numerous other  test  results
         had been invalidated on the basis of  a  'proxy  match'.  The  test
         scores for that college overall are indicative of a large number of
         fraudulent  tests  being  undertaken  and   a   large   number   of
         questionable test results. But that is one factor; it does not mean
         that because of those figures, Mr Hossain  has,  on  a  balance  of
         probabilities, himself practiced deception. the evidence as a whole
         has to be considered.

     15. The Home Office did not enable Mr Hossain to re-test. Had they done
         so the decision on his application for leave to remain may (or  may
         not) have been the same. That however is a  neutral  factor  in  as
         much it is not possible, because of that failure, to reach a tested
         decision on Mr  Hossain's  language  skills  in  2011/2012.  It  is
         however to Mr Hossain's credit that he attempted  to  retrieve  his
         passport from the Home Office to undertake a re-test,  even  though
         not offered one by the Home Office; it is to be  recalled  that  he
         was not informed  by  the  Home  Office  that  he  was  accused  of
         deception until some 18 months after the interview in June 2016.

     16. Mr Hossain has continued to work  in  the  UK.  That  his  language
         skills are more than sufficient now, is evidenced by the  interview
         with the Home Office in June 2016 and his oral evidence before  the
         First-tier Tribunal in 2018. That is not conclusive  evidence  that
         his language skills met the standard required in 2011  or  that  he
         did not obtain that test result  by  deception.  It  is  of  course
         possible that his language skills were  adequate  in  2011  but  he
         still chose, for whatever reason, to obtain a test  certificate  by
         deception. That was not put to  him  and  I  have  discounted  that
         possibility.

     17. In the decision  letter  the  Home  Office  drew  attention  to  Mr
         Hossain's statement that he had previously  only  taken  a  Pearson
         test and not submitted that whereas he had used a TOEIC test result
         to obtain leave to remain. There is no discrepancy in Mr  Hossain's
         evidence from that interview but there is confusion. The  questions
         do not make clear which test is being asked about or  the  relevant
         dates. This was not clarified at the end of the interview  and  nor
         was it raised in oral evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
         have placed no weight either way on that confusion.

     18. Mr Hossain took a successful language test (IELTS)  in  Bangladesh.
         He has been studying in the UK  since  2008  until  2013,  possibly
         later - it is not  clear  from  the  documents  before  me.  He  is
         working, has no  criminal  convictions,  has  two  British  citizen
         children and is married and living  with  his  wife.  There  is  no
         suggestion that he did not undertake the studies for which  he  had
         leave or that his language skills were in some way  inadequate  for
         that task. These  are  factors  that  add  weight  to  his  adamant
         assertion that he is of good  character  and  did  not  obtain  his
         language certificate by deception. His English language now appears
         to be fluent.

     19. Taking all of these factors into account  and  placing  significant
         weight on the Operation Faï¿½ade report, I am satisfied that  on  the
         evidence before me, on a balance of probabilities, Mr  Hossain  did
         take the language test and did not obtain his language  certificate
         by deception.

     20. The SSHD accepts that Mr Hossain is in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with his  wife  and  they  have  two  British  Citizen
         children. There was no submission by Mr  Bates  that  it  would  be
         reasonable for the family to relocate, it being impliedly  accepted
         that if Mr Hossain succeeded in his challenge to the assertion that
         he  had  employed  deception  in  connection  with   his   language
         certificate, then  he  succeeded  in  his  claim  that  a  decision
         refusing him leave to remain in the UK was disproportionate.

     21. In the light of my finding that Mr Hossain did, on the  balance  of
         probabilities take the  test  as  he  claims  and  did  not  employ
         deception, then it follows that he succeeds  in  his  human  rights
         claim appeal.

    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

    I set aside the decision

    I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing  Mr  Hossain's  appeal
    against the decision of the SSHD to refuse his human rights claim.
