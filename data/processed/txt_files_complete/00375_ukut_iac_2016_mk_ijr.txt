Applicant.

behalf of the Respondent.


The Upper Tribunal's jurisdiction to decide an application for Judicial
Review is not affected by the applicant's being in Scotland.  The Tribunal
will, however, consider issues of forum non conveniens if it is suggested
that its jurisdiction should not be exercised.




                                  JUDGMENT



   1. This in an  application  for  judicial  review.   The  decision  under
      challenge is a decision by the Secretary of State on 9 July 2015.   It
      is a decision refusing to reconsider an earlier decision refusing  the
      applicant leave on human rights grounds.


   2. The decision letter is in  standard  form  but  it  is  convenient  to
      indicate that it begins with the address  of  the  decision-maker,  an
      address in Sheffield; it then goes on to  say  that  the  decision  in
      question has  previously  been  the  subject  of  an  application  for
      judicial review and  for  that  reason  the  decision-maker  does  not
      propose to take the matter further.  We shall say in due  course  more
      about the context in which that was said.

   3. The applicant himself is, and has been for a long time,  in  Scotland;
      he is there unlawfully; he has been there unlawfully for a long  time.
      The present judicial review proceedings were issued in the Tribunal in
      England and Wales on 27 October 2015, out  of  time.   Permission  was
      refused on the papers and the application for permission  was  renewed
      orally before Judge Eshun who heard it and gave  her  decision  on  16
      April 2016.  The decision is in terms that have caused some  confusion
      to this Tribunal as well as,  we  understand,  to  the  parties.   The
      refusal of permission on the papers had alluded to the fact that there
      might be an issue of jurisdiction of  this  Tribunal  in  England  and
      Wales in relation to a judicial review claim brought by  an  applicant
      in Scotland.  That matter was the subject of submissions before  Judge
      Eshun and she concluded that the matter  required  further  discussion
      and she therefore, it appears, granted permission on that issue.   She
      did not, we are told, hear any submissions at all in relation  to  the
      merits of the claim.

   4. As we noted during the course of argument,  her  grant  of  permission
      might be taken to confirm her view that she had jurisdiction and  that
      therefore the issue as to territorial jurisdiction was to  be  settled
      in the applicant's favour.  We are persuaded by the  submissions  made
      by Mr Malik before us today that that matter does indeed  remain  open
      and would have to remain open in view of its preliminary nature.   But
      there is a further difficulty in that it is said by those  acting  for
      the applicant that it is not clear whether or not Judge Eshun  granted
      permission on the merits.  They say that she did, having not  confined
      her grant of permission.   The  Government's  submission  is  that  in
      context, no attention having been given to the merits of the  case  at
      all, the grant must be seen as a grant of permission related  only  to
      the question of jurisdiction.  So far  as  that  issue  goes,  we  are
      content to accede to Mr Balroop's submissions and treat the grant as a
      grant of permission on all matters.  It therefore follows  that  there
      is permission both in relation to whether the proceedings are properly
      brought  in  this  Tribunal  and  further  whether   the   applicant's
      substantive claim succeeds.

   5. Judge Eshun added, following her decision, the following order:

           "I make an order that no  enforcement  action  is  to  be  taken
           against the applicant while the case is in progress."

   6. It is convenient to bring the status of that order and its  effect  up
      to date because it has some possible  bearing  on  jurisdiction.   The
      applicant, as we have said, is unlawfully in the  United  Kingdom  and
      has been residing unlawfully in Scotland.  He is the subject  of  what
      we suppose must be Temporary Admission, under which he is required  to
      report twice weekly in Scotland.  He is, at the  moment,  as  we  give
      this judgment, in England and Wales; indeed he  is  in  this  Tribunal
      hearing room.  We have been told that he took the view that  following
      the order by Judge Eshun he had no need to continue to report  and  he
      is currently in breach of his reporting conditions.   For what  it  is
      worth,  we  express  our  view  that  reporting  conditions  are   not
      "enforcement action" and are not in any way affected by Judge  Eshun's
      order.  However, what is, or may be, of some  relevance  is  that  the
      applicant is a person  who  is  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  is  not
      physically restrained from  passing  to  and  fro  across  the  border
      between England and Scotland, as his arrival in London  some  time  in
      the recent past demonstrates.

   7. The question as to jurisdiction is whether a person who is in Scotland
      ought to be allowed to bring judicial review  proceedings  in  England
      and Wales in relation to a decision nominally taken by  the  Secretary
      of State and in fact taken in England.  This is a matter not free from
      authority; there have been a number of decisions of the higher  courts
      relating  to  this  very  issue;  some  of  the  decisions  relate  to
      immigration matters.  There is a series of decisions also in  relation
      to tax matters to which  we  have  not  been  taken  in  detail.   The
      decisions to which we have specifically been taken are the decision of
      the House of Lords in R (Tehrani) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
      Department [2006] UKHL 26, Sokha v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [1992] SLT 1049 a  decision  of  a  Lord  Ordinary,  and  R
      (Majead) v Immigration Appeal Tribunal [2003] EWCA Civ 615 a  decision
      of the Court of Appeal.

   8. In each of these cases there was a question whether the Court  on  one
      side or the other of the Scottish/English border  was  an  appropriate
      forum for the proceedings which had been brought.  In Majead and  also
      in Tehrani the question was  whether  the  refusal  of  permission  to
      appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal was judicially reviewable in
      Scotland or England as the  case  may  be.   In  Sokha,  however,  the
      decision under challenge was a  decision  which  had  never  been  the
      subject of an appeal; it was a decision relating to the  detention  of
      the Petitioner under immigration powers. The Petitioner was  a  person
      who had at all material times been in England and who was detained  in
      England.  He brought proceedings in Scotland, apparently thinking that
      he would have a better chance of success there.  His  only  connection
      in Scotland was the proceedings.  Lord Prosser decided that there  was
      no good reason to allow him to bring the proceedings in Scotland; this
      was properly an English case.  In making  that  decision  he  did  not
      suggest that the Court of Session had no jurisdiction; but  it  was  a
      case which was not appropriately brought in Scotland according to  the
      rules of forum (non) conveniens.  That was a case where, it is  to  be
      observed, the decision under challenge was a Ministerial  decision,  a
      decision of a Minister operating both in England and in Scotland.  The
      difficulty for the applicant was that he had brought  the  proceedings
      in the part of the United Kingdom to which he  had  no  connection  at
      all, and which other than by  their  issue,  the  proceedings  had  no
      connection.


   9. In Tehrani and Majead the matter was somewhat  different.   Under  the
      provisions applying to statutory appeals, appeals were, so  to  speak,
      channelled to the north or south of the English/Scottish Border  under
      certain provisions set out in statute and rules which  also  contained
      provisions as to the "appropriate appeal court" depending on where the
      determination of the adjudicator  was  made  [requiring  that  further
      appeals to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal were to be brought  on  one
      side or the other of the border].  In each case the challenge was to a
      refusal by the Immigration Appeal Tribunal of permission to appeal  to
      itself.  That was a refusal which ex hypothesei was  made  in  a  case
      which had already been the subject of a statutory channelling  to  one
      side or the other of the border.

  10. In Majead the decision was taken by the Court of  Appeal  in  England,
      that the case being essentially a Scottish case, and hence a  Scottish
      appeal, and hence a Scottish decision on the refusal of permission  to
      appeal, albeit made in London by a Vice President of  the  Immigration
      Appeal Tribunal, was a decision which was properly subject to judicial
      review if at all, in the Court of Session, not in the  High  Court  in
      England and Wales.  In Tehrani the same  position  was  taken  mutatis
      mutandis but Tehrani gives us the advantage of a full  review  of  the
      authorities as well as being of the highest authority.

  11. It appears to us clear beyond a doubt that the High Court  in  England
      and Wales and so the Tribunal under the transfer provisions of ss.  15
      and  19  of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act  2007  has
      jurisdiction judicially to review a decision of the Secretary of State
      for the Home Department wherever taken.  The jurisdiction of the  High
      Court in England and Wales does not depend on any fact as to the place
      in the United Kingdom in which a  decision  taken  on  behalf  of  the
      Secretary of State was made.  The  question  therefore  in  all  these
      cases  must  be,  as  explained  in  some  detail  in   the   speeches
      particularly of Lord Hope and Lord Rodger  in  Tehrani,  an  issue  of
      forum (non) conveniens.  That, as Lord Hope  points  out,  is  not  an
      issue of practical convenience but as in  the  word  we  have  already
      used, appropriate.  As the Court points out in Tehrani, in  particular
      as Lord Hope says at para 56:

          "In my opinion,  provided  always  that  the  application  to  the
          supervisory jurisdiction is competent and the Court of Session has
          jurisdiction over the exercise of the power that has been given to
          it by the decision-maker, the court  is  bound  to  entertain  the
          application."

  12. If there is jurisdiction to  entertain  the  claim,  it  follows  that
      unless the Court is persuaded that it is not the appropriate forum, it
      should proceed to entertain the claim.  That has to  be  our  starting
      point too.  The question therefore is whether  it  is  appropriate  to
      entertain the claim.

  13. We have heard Mr Malik's submissions at some length on that.  He  made
      them avowedly on the basis that he  was  not  particularly  seeking  a
      decision that the claim should not be  entertained  but  that  he  was
      seeking to air the issue so that the Tribunal could consider it.

  14. There are a number of factors which might be  taken  into  account  in
      deciding whether  the  present  forum  is  or  is  not  one  which  is
      conveniens.  One factor alluded to in Tehrani and in particular by the
      Lord Ordinary in that case at first instance was that if in that  case
      the Court of  Session  were  to  make  an  interlocutor  reducing  the
      decision of an English Tribunal sitting in England  it  could  not  be
      enforced.  That may, under certain circumstances, be a  factor  to  be
      taken into account, but as Lord Rodger  points  out  it  is  not  even
      clearly the case as regards Scots Law.  He cites Eliot v Riddel [1663]
      M 1305 in which the pursuer had wadset his lands to  the  defender  in
      respect of a sum of money which he  owed  the  defender.   The  wadset
      contained an irritancy clause under which the pursuer would  lose  his
      right of reversion to the lands if the sum in question  was  not  paid
      precisely at the  due  term.   Eventually,  the  defender  obtained  a
      "declarator" from "the English Judges" as it was said, but  that  does
      not  appear  to  have  dissuaded  a  Scots  Court  from   issuing   an
      interlocutor reducing the decision of "the English Judges".  So,  even
      that point is not absolutely clear; and there is no doubt  in  present
      circumstances that the Tribunal sitting in England and Wales has power
      to reduce a decision of the Minister or to quash it.   That is why, in
      our judgment, there is an important distinction between  the  line  of
      cases dealing with refusals of application for  permission  to  appeal
      already channelled to  England  or  Scotland  and  decisions  relating
      directly to decisions by a Minister.

  15. The second issue which has been raised in some of the cases,  and  was
      raised in Tehrani, was whether the forum which had been chosen  should
      be regarded as conveniens because by the time that  it  had  made  its
      decision on whether to exercise jurisdiction, an  applicant  would  be
      out of time for a claim on the other side of the border.  That  was  a
      point taken in Tehrani at a time when in Scotland there  was  no  time
      limit for judicial review in contrast to England.  There is now a time
      limit for most purposes in Scotland.

  16. It appears that it is a matter which did have  some  effect  on  their
      Lordships in Tehrani but it seems to us that it is very unlikely to be
      frequently a  matter  which  will  properly  be  taken  into  account.
      Certainly so far as England and Wales has historically been  concerned
      and so far as concerns Scotland now, there is power to extend time; if
      the forum chosen is decided not to be conveniens that will no doubt be
      a good reason why, if the claim is then re-brought on the  other  side
      of the border, time should be extended.  It  is  a  matter  which  the
      judge dealing with the new claim, if it is out of time, will  have  to
      deal with.

  17. The only remaining factor, therefore, is whether there is  some  other
      basis upon which it can be said that the forum chosen by the applicant
      is not conveniens.  If there is no reason for saying that  it  is  not
      conveniens other than that there is a parallel jurisdiction elsewhere,
      then, as indicated by Lord Rodger in Tehrani the claimant's choice  of
      forum will be the one in which the matter is decided.

  18. Other than general issues of  the  distribution  of  business  between
      offices and  Courts,  north  and  south  of  the  border,  we  do  not
      understand Mr Malik to have drawn our  attention  to  any  basis  upon
      which it can properly be said that  the  High  Court  in  England  and
      Wales, and hence the Upper Tribunal in its transferred judicial review
      jurisdiction is not an appropriate forum for the  determination  of  a
      judicial review of a decision of a Minister exercising powers over the
      entire United Kingdom even if the applicant is in a part of the United
      Kingdom outside  of England and Wales.

  19. So far as this case is concerned we see no reason  for  not  following
      the choice of the applicant, claimant or petitioner however he  is  to
      be described in the various possible fora.  So far as jurisdiction  is
      concerned, our judgment is  therefore  first  that  the  Tribunal  has
      jurisdiction and secondly that there is no reason why  it  should  not
      exercise it.

   The merits

  20. As will have been apparent, the applicant has a  considerable  history
      in the United Kingdom.  He came to  the  United  Kingdom  first  as  a
      student nurse and was granted leave to remain until  31  August  2004.
      He made applications for further leave.  It is  not  absolutely  clear
      when his leave expired but it is certain that he no longer  has  leave
      and it appears that he has not had leave for some time.  Indeed it may
      be that his leave expired as long  ago  as  31  October  2004,  nearly
      twelve years ago.  Despite that, he did not leave the United  Kingdom,
      and as he has subsequently admitted, he spent a considerable amount of
      the next seven or eight years at least, living fraudulently within the
      United Kingdom, claiming  benefits  to  which  he  was  not  entitled;
      obtaining student loans to which he was not entitled; and  it  appears
      making himself well known  to  senior  members  of  the  Labour  Party
      without telling them of his true status.  He  has  made  a  number  of
      applications for further leave, apparently on  human  rights  grounds,
      apparently based on the fact that as was put on his  behalf  today  he
      has behaved entirely consistently.  He has apparently put  down  roots
      in the United  Kingdom  because  he  has  been  able  to  remain  here
      unlawfully and fraudulently and he now relies on those roots to  found
      a claim to remain.  Indeed we were told on his behalf that  he  relies
      in part on his having made charitable donations apparently out of  his
      fraudulently obtained funds, we are also told that he  relies  on  his
      university qualifications, apparently obtained when he had no business
      to be in the Untied Kingdom, had no business to be at a university  in
      the United Kingdom and had no business to have the loans on  which  he
      lived while he was studying.  We were told also that he  has  assisted
      immigration appellants in their appeals.  He is not said ever to  have
      been authorised to do so: if he was acting by  himself,  it  looks  as
      though it was an offence under s. 84 of the 1999 Act; if  he  was  not
      acting by himself, it looks  as  though  he  must  have  been  working
      illegally.


  21. Those facts are at the heart of the applicant's case and that was  the
      case which he is said to have put to the Home Office as the basis upon
      which he should be allowed to remain in the United Kingdom relying  on
      article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The matter  was
      first dealt with formally in the period between April and August 2011.
       The application was refused; there was  a  right  of  appeal  because
      there was also a removal decision;  the  appeal  was  dismissed.   The
      judge took into account, at that stage, what were then the applicant's
      admissions as to  his  criminal  conduct.   Subsequently  it  is  said
      further applications have been made.  We have not seen them.  We  have
      not been shown them.  They are not in the papers.  That,  for  reasons
      which we shall explain, is a matter of some importance.  What is clear
      is that the applicant has had no success in whatever communications he
      has had with the Home Office since then.  Most recently the  applicant
      has asserted that he was entitled  to  re-consideration  of  the  last
      refusal decision, under the terms of the policy which is  designed  to
      provide interim cover for decisions which are caught between  the  old
      statutory appeal provisions and the new  statutory  appeal  provisions
      introduced under the Immigration Act 2014.


  22. The latter provisions provide a general right of  appeal  against  the
      refusal of a human rights claim, as defined in the 2002 Act.  That  is
      a right of appeal which did not previously exist and  some  applicants
      who, having raised human rights grounds and received  a  decision  not
      carrying a right of appeal,  may  therefore  find  that  if  only  the
      decision had been made later they would have had a  right  of  appeal.
      The policy is designed to deal with persons in  that  situation.   The
      applicant's claim is that he requested such  a  reconsideration;  that
      his request ought to have given rise to a  reconsideration  under  the
      policy; and that the Secretary of State's response  to  it,  which  we
      have summarised previously was an inadequate and unlawful response.

  23. We therefore look at the policy.  It is the policy headed "Request for
      reconsiderations of human rights or protection  based  claims  refused
      without right of appeal before 6 April 2015,  Version  1".   It  is  a
      direction to the Secretary of State's officers.  It is  published  and
      there is therefore no doubt  that  as  a  matter  of  public  law  the
      Secretary of State's officers are obliged to comply with the policy as
      a matter of procedure.  The relevant parts of the policy to  which  we
      have been referred are as follows:

          "Scope of requests for reconsiderations guidance
          This page tells you which cases  may  be  considered  against  the
          criteria for accepting a request for reconsideration.
          This guidance only applies if a person  previously  made  a  valid
          protection or human rights claim which:
         . would attract a right of appeal (subject  to  certification)  if
           decided under the law as it applies from 6 April 2015
          and
         .  because the person had no leave to enter or remain  in  the  UK
           when the claim was
              refused, did not attract a right of appeal under the law which
          applied before 6 April
                           2015
                        In  addition,  the  guidance  only  applies  if  the
person:
         .   did not receive a removal decision when  the  application  for
           leave to remain was
                            refused or subsequently
        .   failed to leave the UK voluntarily, and
        .   has requested that a reconsideration (or  removal  decision)  be
          made."

  24. We do not need to set out the rest of the  guidance,  save  a  further
      passage towards the end of this part, which is as follows:


          "You should normally only agree to reconsideration when  requested
          in the following cases:
      . the refused application for leave to remain  included  a  dependent
        child under 18
                   who had been resident in the UK for three years or  more
        at the time of
                   application
      . the applicant has a dependent child under the age of 18  who  is  a
        British citizen
      . the applicant is being supported by the Home Office or has provided
        evidence of
                   being supported by a local authority in accordance  with
        a duty in legislation
      . there are exceptional  or  compelling  reasons  to  reconsider  the
        decision at this
                   time, or
      . it is operationally expedient  or  appropriate  to  reconsider  the
        decision."


  25. We have indicated that the decision under challenge was made solely on
      the basis that as it, or a previous similar decision had already  been
      the subject of a judicial review claim, that was a  claim  brought  in
      Scotland which had no success at all, it was dismissed ab initio.  The
      decision-maker proposed  to  take  reconsideration  no  further.   The
      argument on  behalf  of  the  claimant  is  that  that  was  a  wholly
      inappropriate approach to a reconsideration request under this policy.




  26. But if that were right, let us examine how the reconsideration request
      should have been considered.  The  initial  question  is  whether  the
      person previously made a valid protection or human rights  claim.   As
      we understand it, the claimant's submissions fall  into  two  parallel
      streams.  First, there is the claim  which  undoubtedly  was  a  valid
      human rights claim, made in 2011, and which led  to  the  decision  of
      2011, which was a removal decision, carrying the right of appeal.   If
      that is the claim on which the applicant relies however, it is a claim
      which did receive a removal decision when the application for leave to
      remain was refused and under those circumstances  does  not  meet  the
      requirements of the third bullet point.

  27. The applicant says, however, that that does not rule him out,  because
      he made a valid human rights claim after the appeal decision. However,
      despite our best endeavours, we have  been  unable  to  discover,  and
      indeed the applicant has not suggested that we should have  been  able
      to discover in the papers for this claim, any document which could  be
      described as "a valid protection or human rights claim", as defined in
      the 2002 Act.  We do not say that no such  claim  was  made,  but  the
      applicability of this policy requires demonstration that such a  claim
      was made: there has been no such demonstration.


  28. It therefore follows that there is no basis upon which  anybody  could
      properly decide, on the material available to the Tribunal, that there
      was a  proper  opportunity  for  reconsideration  in  this  case:  the
      preliminary conditions are  not  shown  to  be  met.   In  any  event,
      however, supposing they were met, the position then is that the person
      taking the decision would have to go to consider  whether  he  or  she
      should "agree to reconsideration".   At an earlier stage the  claimant
      said that the third of the bullet points that the applicant "is  being
      supported by the  Home  Office  or  has  provided  evidence  of  being
      supported by a local authority  was  relevant".   It  clearly  is  not
      applicable, as was conceded before us today.  Instead, Mr Balroop,  on
      behalf of the applicant has suggested that this is a case where  there
      are exceptional and compelling reasons  to  reconsider  the  decision.
      This is certainly an exceptional and compelling case.  It  is  a  case
      which is wholly vitiated from  the  beginning  by  fraud.   There  are
      exceptional and  compelling  reasons  but  they  are  not  reasons  to
      reconsider the decision.  It is perfectly  clear  that  any  decision-
      maker would reach the view that the reasons in this  case  are  simply
      reasons to leave the adverse decision in place.


  29.  It  follows  that  whatever  the  terms  of  the  response   to   the
      reconsideration  request  had  been  in  this  case,  it   is   wholly
      inconceivable that they would have been in the applicant's favour.  In
      those circumstances the fact that the writer of  the  decision  letter
      took what is said to have been a bad point and failed to work  through
      the guidance, is immaterial to  the  outcome  of  the  reconsideration
      request and response process.  This, therefore, is a case in which  it
      cannot be said that the applicant has been affected by  the  error  of
      law that he purports to demonstrate in the decision letter.  For  that
      reason judicial review of it is refused.

   Costs

  30. Mr Malik on behalf of the Secretary of State seeks his costs summarily
      assessed in total at �5,174.00.  It is argued by Mr Balroop on  behalf
      of the claimant that the issue of jurisdiction featured largely in the
      case and was raised not by the applicant but in origin by the Tribunal
      and that to an extent the applicant  has  won  on  that  issue.   That
      submission has to be considered in the context of the  fact  that  the
      issue as to jurisdiction was considered in a case which was  from  the
      beginning apparently without any substantive merit at all.   That is a
      case which the applicant chose to bring.   Nevertheless  the  judgment
      that we have given is one which is likely to be regarded  as  of  some
      general import and it is perhaps in  those  circumstances  not  wholly
      right for the applicant to pay the whole  of  the  costs  incurred  in
      sorting out a matter in the public interest.  We will  therefore  make
      an order which reduces the Secretary  of  State's  claim  by  �1200.00
      rounded down.  The order is that the applicant pays the  Secretary  of
      State's costs summarily assessed at �4,000.00

   Anonymity


  31. Mr Balroop  seeks  anonymity  for  the  applicant  given  his  adverse
      history.  There is no good reason to depart from  the  principle  that
      justice should be in public. We decline to make the order sought.


   Permission to appeal


  32. We have an application for permission to appeal on the basis that  the
      criteria should have been regarded as being met.  That  has  not  been
      characterised as an arguable error of law but simply on the basis that
      the facts were such that the policy  was  applicable.   There  is,  in
      truth, no basis for a claim that there was an arguable error of law in
      our judgment, but in any event there is no reasonable prospect of  any
      appeal, on that basis  or  any  other,  so  far  as  we  can  see,  it
      succeeding.  We refuse permission.
