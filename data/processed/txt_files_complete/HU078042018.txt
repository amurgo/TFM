                            DECISION AND REASONS
Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Easterman ('the Judge') sent to the parties on 17 June  2019  by  which
    the appellant's appeal against the decision of the respondent to refuse
    to grant him indefinite leave to remain on long residence  grounds  was
    dismissed.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrews granted permission to appeal  on  all
    grounds by way of a decision dated 7 August 2019.


Anonymity

 3. No anonymity direction was issued by the Judge and no  application  for
    such direction was made before us.


Background

 4. The appellant is a national of Sri Lanka who is presently aged  56.  He
    secured entry clearance as a student in 2007 and was granted  leave  to
    enter upon his arrival in this country on 6 September 2007.  His  leave
    was subsequently varied to leave to remain as a student until  31  July
    2010. He was then granted leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant
    to 17 August 2012 and following an in-time application such  leave  was
    varied to 20 February 2016.

 5. The applicant applied for indefinite leave  to  remain  ('ILR')  on  23
    October 2015 detailing that he was self-employed  and  earning  through
    employed work. During his interview on 5 May 2016, a copy of which  was
    filed with the First-tier Tribunal ('the FtT'), he asserted that he had
    temporarily stopped working for his business  some  two  or  so  months
    prior to the interview and was working  for  Sainsbury's  Supermarkets.
    The respondent observed during the interview  that  the  appellant  was
    currently employed by Sainsbury's working 20 hours  per  week.  He  had
    been employed by ARL Services (UK) Ltd, working between 25.5  hours  to
    69.75 hours per month  between  October  2014  to  February  2015.  The
    appellant was also claiming to have earned �70,783.35 gross profit  and
    �58,623.00 net profit from self-employed earning over a 12-month period
    prior to the 2015 application.

 6. The respondent refused the application for  ILR  on  11  November  2016
    detailing, inter alia:

         'As evidence of your self-employment earnings you have provided 106
         invoices addressed  to  individuals.  Each  invoice  describes  the
         services provided as 'Business introduction commission',  'Business
         co-ordination fee' or  'Consultant  fee'.  At  your  interview  you
         initially stated that you 'help to export some  Chinese  companies'
         goods  to  somewhere  else,  to  the  warehouse.'   However,   this
         information does not corroborate the description of  your  services
         which you later provided at your  interview  in  which  you  stated
         'Somebody needs to send some vehicles with tax  reduction.  I  help
         them to find a suitable  vehicle  according  to  their  budget  and
         introduce the cargo agent. Arrange with Sri Lankan agent  to  clear
         the vehicle with tax reduction. During this period, I help them  to
         get the blue permit to my customer.  This  is  the  most  important
         document to reduce tax.' You were  also  asked  whether  you  could
         provide further details to  describe  what  'Business  introduction
         commission' meant and you stated 'Somebody needs to buy a  suitable
         vehicle to send to Sri Lanka. I help  them  buy  the  vehicle  from
         their market according to their budget. They find the vehicle  from
         the market for less that 4 years from the first registration  date.
         When they send to Sri Lanka it should be older than 2 to  5  years.
         After 12 months I help them to get the blue permit.  Someone  stays
         more than 1 year and if they have  registered  their  vehicle  more
         than 12 months, they are eligible to  send  their  vehicle  to  Sri
         Lanka with tax reduction. I provide  advice  and  find  a  suitable
         cargo argent.'


         We are not satisfied that the services carried out, as described by
         the invoices and yourself at interview can viably  generate  a  net
         profit  of  �58,623.00.  You  have  provided  no  services   beyond
         assisting an individual to purchase a vehicle  and  recommending  a
         cargo agent to ship the vehicle overseas ...


         Furthermore, the  bank  statements  you  have  provided  with  your
         application do not demonstrate that you have generated a net profit
         of �58,623.00. Whilst it is acknowledged that each invoice  payment
         is corroborated by a matching payment to your bank account,  it  is
         notable that a corresponding  amount  is  transferred  out  of  the
         account each month. At your interview you were asked to explain the
         pattern of transactions shown by your bank statements at interview:


         [references to bank statements]


        A. Er. Actually, I don't have an exact idea. Sometimes  my  clients
           try to pay me cash in hand. I advised  them  to  deposit  in  my
           bank. If I use some urgent  money,  I  use  the  cash  machines.
           Sometimes they come to my house and try to pay by  cash,  but  I
           tell them to go to the nearest bank to deposit the money.

         You have failed  to  satisfactorily  account  for  the  pattern  of
         payments shown by your bank statements at your  interview.  As  the
         sole trader of your business and bank account holder  it  would  be
         reasonable to expect you to be able to  have  an  idea  as  to  why
         payments were made to and from your bank account. The fact that you
         failed to explain where the money was transferred to or explain the
         purpose of the transactions, casts doubt on the credibility of  the
         self-employed earnings. The pattern of payments to  and  from  your
         bank account, the fact that you have not  opened  a  business  bank
         account (or have provided no evidence of a  business  bank  account
         with your application) and the lack of information you provided  at
         interview with respect to the payments to  and  from  your  account
         lead us to question whether the claimed income was  earned  through
         genuine employment, rather than being borrowed, gifted or otherwise
         shown in your  financial  transactions  or  records  without  being
         earned.'

 7. The  appellant  requested  an  administrative  review.  The  respondent
    maintained the refusal by means of a decision dated 5 January  2017  in
    which the section of the November  2016  decision  detailed  above  was
    unamended.

 8. The appellant applied for leave to remain on human rights  (article  8)
    grounds on 18 January 2017,  some  13  days  after  the  administrative
    review  decision.  The  application  was  subsequently  varied  on   12
    September 2017 to one seeking  ILR  on  long  residence  grounds  under
    paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules.  The  respondent  refused  the
    application under paragraph 276D by way of a decision  dated  19  March
    2018, as the appellant did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    276B(ii) and 276B(iii), with  reference  to  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
    Rules.

 9. It is appropriate to observe the  core  issues  identified  within  the
    decision of March 2018:

         'Within your application dated 17 August 2012 for leave  to  remain
         as a Tier 1 (General) migrant, Home Office records  show  that  you
         claimed self-employed earnings of �68,759 for the  period  15  July
         2011 and 15 July 2012. However, HMRC data confirms  that  you  have
         not  declared  any  self-employed  earnings  or  earnings   through
         dividends for the entire tax years 2011/2012 or 2012/2013.


         ...


         On 23 October 2015 you made an application for Indefinite Leave  to
         Remain under the Tier 1  (General)  Migrant  route.  However,  this
         application was refused on the basis that the level of  your  self-
         employed income was not accepted. In relation to  this  application
         you claimed that you had previous earnings of �58,623.00 net profit
         for the period from 1 October 2014 to 30 September  2015.  However,
         following an interview with UKVI on 5 May 2016 it  was  found  that
         you failed to satisfactorily account for the  pattern  of  payments
         shown in your bank statements. It was believed  that  as  the  sole
         trader of your  business  and  bank  account  holder  it  would  be
         reasonable to expect you to be able to  have  an  idea  as  to  why
         payments were made  to  and  from  your  bank  account,  which  you
         appeared not to do. It was also believed that  the  fact  that  you
         failed to explain where money was being transferred to and from  or
         explain the purpose of the transactions in your account cast  doubt
         on the credibility of your self-employed earnings for the period of
         1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015 also. The pattern  of  payments
         to and from your bank account, the fact that you  did  not  open  a
         business account (or  provided  no  evidence  of  a  business  bank
         account with your application) and  the  lack  of  information  you
         provided at interview with respect to the payments to and from your
         account led the interviewer to question whether the claimed  income
         was earned through genuine employment, rather than being  borrowed,
         gifted or otherwise show in your financial transactions or  records
         without being earned.


         ...


         On 9 February 2018 you returned the Tax Questionnaire and  provided
         further information relating to earnings  from  2011  to  2017.  At
         question 2 of the Tax Questionnaire you were asked to  confirm  the
         financial years that you were a director of a  limited  company  in
         the United Kingdom. You responded that you  were  registered  as  a
         director of a limited company here from 27 January  2011  until  12
         November 2013. However, in response to question 5, you  claim  that
         your business had no turnover, gross or net profits or expenses for
         the tax years 2010/11; 2011/12 or 2012/13. It is also noted that in
         response to question 6 of the  questionnaire  you  state  that  you
         received �16,259 in self-employed salary and the dividends for  the
         tax year 2011/12 and �19,995 in self-employed salary and  dividends
         for the tax year 2012/13.


         Checks have been made  with  HM  Revenue  &  Customs  (HMRC)  which
         confirm the following: 'As previously stated, you have declared  no
         self-employed earnings to HMRC for the years 2010/11,  2011/12  and
         2012/13 but it is noted from the HMRC witness  statement  that  you
         had �16,529  in  employed  earnings  for  2011/12  and  �19,995  in
         employed earnings for 2012/13 from your employed positions with CIP
         Recruitment Services and Sainsbury's Supermarkets Limited which you
         made no mention of in your 17  August  2012  application.  Even  if
         these earnings for the 2 years were combined that would result in a
         total of �36,254 which is significantly lower that  the  �68,759.00
         as  self-employed  earnings  claimed  on  your   Tier   1   General
         application of 17 August 2012. The declaration of the correct level
         of employed earnings for the period would not have been  sufficient
         for a grant of leave under the Tier 1 General Migrant rules.


         It is acknowledged that Paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules
         is not a mandatory refusal; however, the  evidence  submitted  does
         not establish that the failure to declare to HMRC at the  time  the
         self-employed earnings on your previous application  for  leave  to
         remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant  was  a
         genuine error.


         It is considered that there would have  been  a  clear  benefit  to
         yourself either by failing to declare your full  earnings  to  HMRC
         with  respect  to  reducing  your  tax  liability  or  by   falsely
         representing your earnings to UKVI to enable you to meet the points
         required to obtain leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier
         1 (General) Migrant.'

10. The appellant's grounds of appeal to the FtT, filed by Nag  Solicitors,
    confirm at ��4 and 5:

         'The application was refused under 276B and 322 of the  Immigration
         Rules' character grounds over an alleged discrepancy of the  income
         declared to the Home Office which was at variance with  the  income
         declared to HMRC.


         The appellant submitted that he provided  genuine  details  of  the
         income and shall seek to address the  issues  raised  by  the  Home
         Office in his witness statement.

11. Accompanying a letter from the appellant's former  solicitors,  Solidum
    Solicitors, to the respondent, dated 14 February  2018,  the  appellant
    provided SA302 tax calculations for the tax years 2010/11  to  2015/16.
    For the year ending April 2011, his  gross  income  was  identified  as
    �8,838 and his tax liability was �472.60. He received �505.40 from HMRC
    for tax overpayment. For the year ending April 2012  his  gross  income
    was �16,259 and his tax liability was �2,240. He received  �483.20  for
    tax overpayment. For the year ending April 2013, his gross  income  was
    �19,925 and his tax liability was �3,240.  He  received  �876  for  tax
    overpayment.

12. A witness statement from Joanne Iwanski, an officer of  HMRC,  dated  5
    March 2018 identified the appellant as having been  regularly  employed
    between the tax years 2008/09 to 2016/17. As for self-employment, there
    was a record of the appellant having worked as a consultant for the tax
    years 2013/14 to 2015/16. For the year ending April 2014, he declared a
    gross profit of �13,286 with a net  profit  of  �2,046;  for  the  year
    ending April 2015 a gross profit  of  �63,234  with  a  net  profit  of
    �32,374 and for the year ending April 2016 a gross  profit  of  �40,297
    with net profit of �36,137.


Hearing before First-tier Tribunal

13. The appeal initially came before the Judge, sitting at York  House,  on
    18 March 2019. Prior  to  this  hearing  the  FtT  had  issued  several
    directions to the respondent to file and serve  documents  relating  to
    the appellant's 2012 application. The directions  are  dated  24  April
    2018, 9 July 2018, 6 September 2018, 22 October 2018  and  19  November
    2018.

14. The hearing on 18 March 2019 was adjourned part-heard so as  to  permit
    the appellant the opportunity to file and serve further  documents  and
    for the respondent 'to  do  everything  possible'  to  file  and  serve
    documents relating to the appellant's 2012 application. At [18] of  his
    decision, the Judge notes that the respondent was unable  to  file  and
    serve a copy of the 2012 application.

15. The appellant relied upon two witness statements. The first is dated  8
    October 2018 and the second is dated 30 January 2019. By means  of  his
    first statement, the  appellant  confirmed  that  whilst  pursuing  his
    studies he became a partner  in  'Rithmi  Enterprises',  who  were  the
    Colombo agents for 'sun' and 'astra' branded  thread  and  income  from
    this work enabled him to pursue his Tier  1  (General)  application  in
    2010. He detailed that whilst enjoying leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (General) migrant he established  a  consultancy  service  for  persons
    seeking to import cars into Sri Lanka from this  country.  He  detailed
    the difficulties in importing cars into Sri  Lanka  and  described  the
    nature of his business. The exporter of the vehicle from  this  country
    to Sri Lanka was required to be a Sri Lankan citizen and  was  to  gift
    the vehicle to a relative in Sri Lanka. The exporter  was  required  to
    establish that they were lawfully working in this country  and  had  to
    present  records  of  remitting  funds  to  Sri  Lanka.  He  worked  in
    partnership with two UK-based companies. The appellant  further  stated
    at �19 of his statement that having 'obtained' an extension to his Tier
    1 status in 2013 he registered his company with Companies House in  the
    name of 'Pradeep Research Consultant Ltd'.  We  observe  that  this  is
    inconsistent with the rule 15(2) documents addressed  below  where  the
    appellant relied upon this limited liability business when seeking  his
    extension of leave in 2012.

16. The appellant asserted that he issued invoices to customers  under  the
    name of the company, but money received was paid into his  own  account
    rather than into a separate company account.  He  further  stated  that
    after his visa had 'expired' he did not introduce  anymore  clients  to
    the two companies. He worked  on  his  own  and  he  offered  financial
    assistance so as to secure the release  of  vehicles  from  Sri  Lankan
    customs. However, upon their release, the  appellant  states  that  his
    clients  let  him  down  and  they  walked  away  without  paying  him.
    Consequently, he suffered great financial loss and could not  show  any
    profit to HMRC.

17. Whilst enjoying leave to remain  the  appellant  established  a  second
    company, 'Pradeep Abeyratne' but did not open a bank  account  for  it.
    Again, all transactions were paid into his personal account.

18. By way of his second witness statement,  the  appellant  addressed  the
    respondent's observation that he  could  not  be  self-employed  whilst
    being employed by several employers. He detailed that he did  not  work
    in three jobs at the same time and enjoyed an income through his  self-
    employment. He observed that he worked in average 80  hours  to  159.75
    hours per month for his employers, leaving him ample time to  undertake
    his self-employed work.

19. The appellant detailed in his statement of 30 January 2019 that he  had
    either cleared, or  was  continuing  to  settle,  his  outstanding  tax
    liability with HMRC. Mr. Biggs placed significant reliance upon this in
    his submissions before us, but having  received  further  instructions,
    and with his usual candour, Mr. Biggs confirmed to us that to date  the
    appellant has not sought to amend  his  tax  liability  with  HMRC  and
    therefore has not to date declared his purported previous earnings.

20. The Judge records at [16] of his decision:

         'At the outset of the hearing on 18 March I discussed the issues in
         the case with Mr. Sowerby and Mr. Archie and it was agreed that the
         real issue in this case was whether the respondent could show  that
         there had been dishonesty in the figures presented either  to  HMRC
         or the respondent in earlier applications. There has been a  number
         of adjournments to try  to  find  the  2012  application,  and  the
         paperwork accompanying  it,  but  none  had  borne  fruit,  and  we
         commenced the hearing on the basis that it was for  the  respondent
         to show that the appellant had  misled  either  HMRC  or  the  Home
         Office in relation to the figures presented and that we had all the
         evidence that was available.'

21. The appellant's evidence was recorded,  and  we  observe  [33]  of  the
    decision and reasons:

         'In continuing evidence-in-chief the appellant was asked about  his
         bank accounts which appear in bundles A2 and  A3.  The  account  is
         ****9860 in A2 and ****9160  in  A3  and  he  said  both  were  now
         inactive. The appellant said that one of the accounts he  had  used
         with regard to his business,  the  other  he  had  used  for  other
         expenses. It was put to him that the  money  went  in  between  the
         accounts and the appellant said that  was  not  the  position.  The
         appellant was asked to look at pages 15 and 19 of bundle  A3  where
         on 24 October 2014 there was a transfer into account ****9160  from
         account ****9860 and then on 30 October on page 19 that money  went
         back out to the account it had come from. The  appellant  was  also
         asked about the cash payment on page 9 of some �400 and where  that
         had come from. The appellant accepted there were in fact  transfers
         shown between his accounts and he could not assist with  where  the
         cash had come from at this stage.'

22. We further observe [35] - [39]:

         'The appellant was asked about D.P.M. Fernando. There are a  number
         of entries relating to her shown in the schedule and  he  said  she
         was a client closely associated with him. There  were  others  also
         called Fernando, but the appellant said they were  not  related  so
         far as he was aware, they simply  shared  the  same  name.  Pressed
         further in relation to D.P.M. Fernando the appellant said that  her
         husband was working with him and he got to know  her  better  as  a
         result. He said there was no business relationship  with  her,  her
         husband was working with him and not her.


         The appellant was referred to page 28 of bundle 3 and the amount of
         �10,000. He said it was an amount he had received from a friend and
         he transferred it on, as can be seen on page 29 a transaction on 31
         December 2014. He said the amount had come to him by error  and  it
         was returned by him to her. He said it has not been included in any
         calculations relating to his earnings for the points-based scheme.


         The appellant was asked why it was received from a business account
         and yet transferred to a  personal  account  and  he  said  he  was
         dealing with D.P.M. Fernando through her personal account. He  said
         the online payment facility was already set up. It was put  to  the
         appellant that he had said that he  had  no  business  relationship
         with this lady, and he said that  she  had  her  own  business  and
         several people associated with him became clients. He said if there
         were personal dealings, they went to a business  account.  I  asked
         why that would be if  there  had  been  no  business  dealing,  the
         appellant said that he had been associated  with  her.  It  started
         with her husband,  they  were  family  friends  and  his  wife  did
         financial things, three times she had services  from  him,  and  he
         invoiced her for them.


         On the same topic the appellant confirmed  that  Ms.  Fernando  was
         doing business and he was doing a separate business.  What  he  had
         been trying to explain was that she had  nothing  to  do  with  his
         business, she was a client, all the business dealings were  in  his
         name.'

23. Before the Judge the appellant addressed concerns as to the circulation
    of money between his account and those of friends at [39] - [40]:

         'The appellant was asked about matters shown  on  page  140  of  A2
         where Shevon is mentioned and [in]  other  places  that  is  Shevon
         Ferndando. He was asked about the transfers on 20 October 2014  and
         22 October 2014 [where] �900  and  �800  [are]  shown  coming  into
         account ****9860 and how that related to the  account  at  page  64
         where in October 2015 there are  payments  from  the  appellant  to
         Shevon Fernando in �400, �250 and �800  lots.  The  appellant  said
         that when money was needed each of  his  friends  would  help  each
         other out and they would sort out expenses.


         The appellant was asked about an invoice on page 78  of  bundle  A2
         where there was an invoice for Shevon Fernando in the sum  of  �950
         and how that fitted with a payment out to the same Shevon  Fernando
         from account ****9160 on 13 April  2015  and  it  was  put  to  the
         appellant that there were a large  number  of  transfers  back  and
         forth between himself and Shevon Fernando and while  the  sums  may
         not correspond precisely, Mr. Archie suggested  that  the  business
         transactions suggested [they] were not genuine  and  this  was  the
         money simply circulating. The appellant said that was not  correct.
         These were genuine  transactions.  At  page  6  of  the  Record  of
         Proceedings I have recorded a large number of instances  and  pages
         where monies went back and forth. The  appellant  again  was  asked
         about the transactions and he said that the money that he was  paid
         was for genuine transactions for work done and he was  asked  about
         the money that went from him to Shevon Fernando and he said when we
         go out on trips he gets offers and makes bookings. He  denied  that
         the money was simply circulating between them.  The  appellant  was
         asked whether there was any evidence of these  trips  and  he  said
         there might be pictures on an old phone.'

24. As for the August 2012 application, the  appellant  confirmed  that  he
    could not recall how much he had claimed  for  self-employment  and  he
    could not recall the amount of tax he had paid at the time in  relation
    to such self-employment. The Judge notes at [43]:

         '[The appellant] was referred to a document from HMRC on page 2  of
         4, and he said the tax return may have been filed, but  it  appears
         that the amount filed was insufficient to pay tax on and that could
         not be a correct amount of his earnings, because he could not  have
         achieved the necessary points on the points-based system, if he had
         been earning less that the relevant tax  threshold.  The  appellant
         gave no clear answer ...'

25. As to the appellant's self-employment, the Judge reasoned at [76], [78]
    and [81]:

         'In my view on the  face  of  the  evidence  such  as  it  is,  the
         respondent has  shown  a  clear  discrepancy  between  the  amounts
         declared to HMRC and the amounts declared to the  respondent,  even
         if only a minimum level of what must have been declared  is  known.
         The appellant has been on notice since 2016 that these figures were
         challenged by the respondent and the letter  of  refusal  for  this
         particular application comes as long ago as March 2018. I  find  it
         very hard to accept that if the appellant's business  was  genuine,
         and if the people with whom he did  [work  for]  were  genuine,  he
         would have had any difficulty at all in getting one  or  more  than
         one to come and give evidence to that effect.'


         ...


         A huge amount of time was spent in the hearing going backwards  and
         forwards over the  bank  statements  and  trying  to  elicit  clear
         answers as to what various payments were for and of course  I  make
         due allowance for the fact that this was all  some  time  ago,  but
         having said that, I have also drawn  attention  to  the  fact  that
         these figures have been in issue for a very long time and  I  would
         have expected the appellant to know whether he  had  done  business
         with D.P.M. Fernando, and given  the  nature  of  the  business  is
         somewhat surprising that she would use his services on  the  number
         of occasions she allegedly did. It is  unclear  why  someone  would
         want so many cars in Sri Lanka or why the appellant  would  say  in
         terms he did not do business with her and later on, notwithstanding
         that there were numerous  entries  relating  to  her  in  the  bank
         statements, to say that he did.'


         ...


         'As a result of considering all the evidence and the matters I have
         outlined here, I find on balance,  notwithstanding  that  it  is  a
         matter of dishonesty, that the Secretary of State  has  shown  that
         the figures that must have been  presented  in  order  to  get  the
         points needed for a grant of leave, must have been  misleading  and
         not genuine. Even if that is incorrect  and  those  were  the  true
         figures, I find that the HMRC were in that case misled  as  to  the
         correct income for the appellant and the tax he needed to pay.'

26. The Judge concluded at [82] - [83] and [85]:


         'I asked myself now whether, given the time the appellant has  been
         in the United Kingdom, these matters of dishonesty  are  sufficient
         to allow the Secretary of State to engage paragraph 322(5)  on  the
         basis of the appellant's character. As I  understand  the  case  of
         Balajigari, once  the  respondent  has  proved  dishonesty,  either
         dishonesty to  the  respondent  or  to  the  HMRC,  [this]  can  be
         sufficient to engage paragraph 322(5), but in each case it will  be
         fact-sensitive, as to whether the dishonesty involved is sufficient
         to refuse a person, who otherwise meets all the requirements of the
         Rules.


         In this case I am not satisfied that the appellant did meet all the
         requirements of the  Rules  are  various  stages,  save  for  these
         misleading figures ...'


         ...


         'As a result in the light of the findings I have made I  find  that
         the respondent has shown the appellant has been dishonest either to
         them or to HMRC and that the respondent is entitled to consider the
         use of paragraph 322(5) and that in the circumstances of the case I
         find that the appellant's character and behaviour is such that  the
         decision not to grant him leave is proportionate.'


Grounds of appeal

27. The grounds of appeal were drafted by Mr. Sowerby, who represented  the
    appellant before the Judge. One ground is  advanced,  namely  that  the
    Judge erred in  law  in  determining  the  appeal  in  the  absence  of
    documentary evidence relied upon by the respondent. Reliance is  placed
    upon the decision of MH (Respondent's bundle: documents  not  provided)
    Pakistan [2010] UKUT 168 (IAC) in which this  Tribunal  considered  the
    requirements  of  rule  13  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal
    (Procedure)  Rules  2005  which  is  not  replicated  in  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber)  Rules
    2014 which are relevant to this appeal. The core argument  is  advanced
    at �5 of the grounds:

         'However, it is submitted that the FTTJ has erred in law in finding
         that the appellant has provided misleading figures in circumstances
         where the  respondent,  having  the  burden  of  proof  of  proving
         dishonesty by the appellant, has failed to provide any evidence  of
         alleged dishonesty in relation to the 2012 application.'


Rule 15(2) application

28. At the hearing on 18 October 2019, the respondent  applied  under  rule
    15(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  to  admit
    two documents that were not before the FtT, namely:

        I. GCID notes for 15 January 2013, 21 January 2013 and 20  February
           2013, concerned  with  the  respondent's  consideration  of  the
           appellant's 2012 application for further leave to  remain  as  a
           Tier 1 (General) Migrant;


       II. Pages 1 and 2 of the respondent's draft decision confirming  the
           grant to the appellant of further leave to remain as  a  Tier  1
           (General) Migrant, dated 15 January 2013.

29. The GCID notes detail, inter alia, that the appellant presented himself
    as  being  self-employed  and  earning  �68,759  through   such   self-
    employment. His business was identified as 'Pradeep Research Consultant
    Ltd'. Accompanying the  application  were  bank  statements,  accounts,
    invoices, an accountant's  letter  and  a  solicitor's  letter.  On  15
    January 2013 a provisional decision was made to grant  a  variation  of
    leave but on 21 January 2013 an Executive Officer  disagreed  with  the
    decision as there was missing evidence. The Executive Officer  observed
    that the appellant 'has stated that they are solely self-employed'. The
    application was reconsidered on 20 February 2013, again  on  the  basis
    that the appellant had earned �68,759  solely  through  self-employment
    for the relevant period and a decision was made to vary his leave.

30. The draft letter of 15 January 2013 records  the  appellant  as  having
    been awarded 40 points for previous earnings.

31. Mr. Sowerby confirmed that he could not go behind the provenance of the
    documents now relied upon by the respondent and did not object to their
    admission under rule 15(2). The documents were  admitted.  The  hearing
    was adjourned so as to  permit  the  appellant  time  to  consider  the
    documents.


Decision

32. At the hearing in December 2019, Mr. Biggs' advanced his case concisely
    and with care. Having made an allegation of dishonesty, namely the  use
    of false documents accompanying the 2012 application  or  alternatively
    the  provision  of  false  information  to  HMRC,  he  noted  that  the
    evidential burden fell upon the respondent. Mr.  Biggs  contended  that
    the respondent failed to discharge the evidential burden in this matter
    consequent to a failure to provide any documents relating to  the  2012
    application. Further,  the  Judge  materially  erred  in  relying  upon
    failings by the appellant in producing evidence relating  to  the  2012
    application as well as to his businesses, so reversing  the  burden  of
    proof.

33. Mr. Bramble candidly accepted that the respondent had failed to provide
    any evidence relating to the 2012 application to the  FtT  and  further
    that the Judge had reversed the burden of proof at [76] and [78],  such
    failure adversely impacting upon his  application  of  such  burden  at
    [81].

34. The question for this Tribunal is as to whether the error of law was  a
    material one. Mr. Bramble submitted that upon considering the  evidence
    presented by the appellant in the round, such error made no  difference
    to the outcome. We are mindful that Mr. Biggs' submissions before us as
    to materiality were heavily focused upon his understanding  that  there
    had been to date no consideration of the appellant's amendment  to  his
    2011 tax return. It was on this issue that he took the  opportunity  to
    take further instructions and  subsequently  informed  us  post-hearing
    that there has been no such amendment to date. We have been mindful  to
    consider all relevant issues when assessing materiality.  We  note  Mr.
    Biggs' acceptance that the appellant has enjoyed several  opportunities
    to explain events, enabling us to consider his detailed  evidence  both
    as to the  nature  of  his  self-employment  and  the  conduct  of  his
    businesses.

35. We are mindful that the burden of proof rests upon the respondent as to
    her allegation of deceit, though the burden remains upon the  appellant
    with regards to the overall human rights (article 8) appeal.

36. Upon considering the rule 15(2) evidence, we are  satisfied  that  even
    with the burden of proof being placed upon the respondent there is only
    one decision that  can  reasonably  be  reached  in  this  appeal.  The
    documents now provided by the respondent  clearly  establish  that  the
    application for further leave in 2012 was made solely on the basis that
    the appellant was self-employed  and  documents  were  relied  upon  to
    support his contention that from July 2011 to July 2012 he  had  earned
    �68,759 through his company, Pradeep Research Consultant  Ltd.  As  Mr.
    Sowerby conceded at the hearing in October 2019 the  appellant  is  not
    capable of challenging the provenance of the rule 15(2)  documents  and
    Mr. Biggs did  not  seek  to  resile  from  this  concession.  This  is
    unsurprising as the appellant's case is that he  cannot  remember  what
    documents he provided to the  respondent.  Whilst  providing  requisite
    evidence of such earnings to the respondent  for  the  purpose  of  his
    application to vary his leave, the appellant failed entirely to  inform
    HMRC as to any earnings from self-employment for the tax  years  ending
    2012 and 2013. His sole declarations related  to  gross  earnings  from
    employment; amounting to �18,378 for  the  tax  year  ending  2012  and
    �19,926 for the tax  year  ending  2013.  We  are  satisfied  that  the
    respondent has proved to the requisite standard that the appellant  was
    dishonest either by means of the 2012 application for further leave  to
    remain in this country, in  which  he  relied  upon  his  self-employed
    earnings, or by his declaration to HMRC when  filing  his  2012  and/or
    2013 tax returns. The respondent's decision to refuse  the  appellant's
    application for leave to remain under paragraph 322(5) was lawful.

37. We have taken care to detail the nature and extent of  the  appellant's
    evidence above. We are in agreement with the Judge that the appellant's
    purported self-employment is not genuine.  We  are  satisfied,  to  the
    requisite standard, that the appellant has exercised a crude  mechanism
    of circulating money belonging to friends and  associates  through  his
    accounts so as to provide a veneer to his assertion that he is a  self-
    employed businessman, in circumstances where  his  true  earnings  were
    from his employment with several companies. His evidence, both  written
    and oral  before  the  Judge,  contains  numerous  inconsistencies  and
    retreats from previously adopted positions, such as whether or  not  he
    enjoyed a  business  relationship  with  D.P.M.  Fernando.  We  are  in
    agreement  with  the  Judge  that  the  appellant  did  not  meet   the
    requirements for further leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant
    when granted such leave in 2013. Having made  his  initial  application
    for leave to remain in this category, whilst enjoying leave  to  remain
    as a student, in January 2010, the applicant was required to be earning
    in excess of �35,000 to secure 40 points in his  2012  application.  He
    was unable to  meet  the  earning  requirement  on  the  basis  of  his
    employment and so would not have secured  his  variation  of  leave  in
    2013. We find that since this time he has benefited from his  deception
    by being permitted to remain in this country and work.
