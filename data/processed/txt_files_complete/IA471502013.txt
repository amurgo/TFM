For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The Secretary of State made an application for permission to appeal but
    for the purposes of this appeal I shall refer to the  parties  as  they
    were at the time before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Algeria born on 21 October  1977  and  he
    appeals against the decision of the respondent dated 17 October 2013 to
    refuse further to the provisions of Regulation  2  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006  (the  EEA  Regulations)  his
    application dated 9 March 2013 for a residence card as confirmation  of
    a right to reside in the UK.  The respondent considered the appellant's
    marriage to  Ana Marina Conceicao Lopes was a marriage  of  convenience
    and further, that the qualifying national Miss Lopes had  not  provided
    sufficient evidence that she was economically active in the UK  at  the
    time of the application  and  thus  a  qualified  national  further  to
    Regulation 6 of the EEA Regulations.  The appellant  and  sponsor  were
    married in June 2003.

 3. The immigration  history  was  recited  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Onoufrio who allowed the appeal on 12 September  2014.   The  appellant
    claimed he entered the UK on 28 July  2001  without  leave  and  on  17
    October  2003  he  married  an  EEA  national.   He   made   subsequent
    applications for  residence  cards  which  were  refused  and  on  19th
    December 2011 he sought a  permanent  residence  card  which  was  also
    refused.

 4. The respondent's application  for  permission  to  appeal  was  on  the
    following basis.  The first ground was that the  judge  had  failed  to
    apply Boodhoo and Another (EEA Regulations  relevant  evidence]  [2013]
    UKUT 00346 which confirmed that the Tribunal must consider the facts as
    at the date of the appeal hearing and that "at least for an in  country
    appeal Section 85(4) makes clear that the Tribunal  must  consider  all
    relevant evidence including matters  arising  after  the  date  of  the
    decision and  must determine the facts as at the date of the hearing LS
    (Post decision evidence) Gambia UKAIT 00085.

 5. Further it was submitted that the judge had failed to provide  adequate
    reasons for accepting that the appellant was in a genuine relationship.



 6. Permission to appeal was granted.

 7. I find that although the issue  of  a  marriage  of  convenience  under
    Regulation 2 of the EEA Regulations  was  raised  in  the  reasons  for
    refusal letter by the respondent, the judge tackled this issue  clearly
    at paragraph 16 and stated that

         "It is highly unlikely the appellant would have  received  so  many
         documents from his wife spanning such a long period  if  they  were
         not genuinely married together.  Furthermore  there  was  the  oral
         evidence of his three co-tenants who all appeared  to  be  credible
         witnesses.  Therefore, taking into account the date and  length  of
         the marriage, the photographic and  documentary  evidence  and  the
         oral evidence I am satisfied that this was a genuine  marriage  and
         not one of convenience."

 8. He gave sufficient reasoning in this succinct paragraph.  There was  no
    suggestion by the respondent that the  marriage  certificate   produced
    was  not genuine and the judge having accepted that  the  marriage  was
    genuine appeared to accept that the marriage was one  which  was  valid
    and not, at the relevant time, one of convenience.

 9. I note that  the  appellant's  spouse  had  subsequently  sponsored  an
    application with another party but this does not indicate that  at  the
    time the appellant married that the respondent was not free  to  do  so
    and I am not persuaded that the respondent has discharged the burden of
    proof following Papajorgji (EEA spouse -marriage of convenience) Greece
    [2012] UKUT 00038 (IAC) that the appellant had entered  a  marriage  of
    convenience at the date when the marriage was  contracted.   Papajorgji
    confirms that there is no burden at the outset of an application  on  a
    claimant to demonstrate that a marriage to an EEA national is  not  one
    of convenience.  There was no evidence that the appellant  and  sponsor
    had divorced.  The facts as identified by the judge did not  appear  to
    shift the  evidential  burden  to  the  claimant  to  address  evidence
    justifying reasonable suspicion that it was a marriage of convenience.

10. I find that the  judge  has  adequately  addressed  the  issue  of  the
    marriage.

11. A further question was the  relevant  date  for  considering  when  the
    appellant's wife was someone who  was  exercising  treaty  rights.  The
    judge addressed this issue at paragraph 18 and clearly stated:   "There
    is no evidence at the date of the hearing that the appellant's wife was
    either self-employed or in employment."  Nevertheless the  judge  found
    that at the date of the application the sponsor was in employment.

12. Mr Nathan submitted that Section 85(4) confirmed that the relevant date
    for the purposes of determining the appeal was the date of the decision
    (17th October 2013).  The reasons for refusal letter  stated  that  the
    sponsor had "not provided sufficient evidence that she [the sponsor] is
    economically active in the UK at the time  of  your  application"  (9th
    March 2013).

13. The judge specifically found that

         "There are various receipted invoices for work she has carried  out
         for the period 31 July 2012 to 28 February 2013 which  is  for  the
         period  immediately  prior  to  and  just  part  the  date  of  his
         application.  His wife's invoices in fact  go  back  to  31  August
         2010.  His wife's bank statements are not particularly  helpful  as
         none  of  them  cover  the  period   immediately   prior   to   the
         application.  There is however a profit and loss account  dated  20
         February 2013 prepared By Zakroon Financial Services showing  total
         income from employment and  self-employment  of  �8,555  and  after
         allowances showing an income tax and Class 4 NIC liability of �216.
          There is also a self-assessment statement dated 11  December  2012
         shortly before the date of the application.  Therefore  whilst  her
         income was not substantial clearly  the  appellant's  wife  was  in
         employment and particularly self-employment  at  the  time  of  the
         appellant's application and therefore she was an  EEA  national  of
         Portugal exercising her treaty rights."

14. The judge concluded that 'Accordingly as a family member of a qualified
    person i.e. her spouse entitles the appellant to an  initial  right  of
    residence under Regulation 13(2) of the 2006 Regulations'.

15. As Mr Nathan submitted, the key date is the date of the decision and in
    fact the date of decision was 17th October 2013.   I  would  agree.  As
    Boodhoo establishes

          (1)  Neither section  85A  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
         Asylum Act 2002 nor the guidance in DR (Morocco)* [2005]  UKAIT  38
         regarding a previous version of section 85(5) of that Act  has  any
         bearing on an appeal under the Immigration (European Economic Area)
         Regulations 2006. In such  an  appeal,  a  tribunal  has  power  to
         consider any evidence which it thinks relevant to the substance  of
         the decision, including evidence which concerns  a  matter  arising
         after the date of the decision.

16. I therefore find an error of law.

17. On a trawl through the  documentation  Mr  Nathan  confirmed  that  the
    references to challenging the genuine  relationship  was  misconceived.
    There simply needed to be a  marriage  and  I  therefore  preserve  the
    references in the judge's determination to this fact.

18. I turn to the question of whether the sponsor was a qualified  national
    at the relevant time.  The fact is that the judge accepted that between
    2012 to 2013 there was sufficient evidence to show that the appellant's
    ex-spouse was a qualifying national.  I note that there was before  the
    First Tier Tribunal further independent documentary evidence from  HMRC
    for the tax years 2008/2009, 2009/2010, 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 showing
    that the appellant's spouse was in  fact  earning  and  from  the  sums
    recited in the HMRC documentation  not  just  a  marginal  amount,  and
    paying tax (by virtue of the documentary evidence)  in  each  of  those
    years. The appellant and sponsor had been married since 2003 and living
    in the UK. I accept that she could be classified over those five years,
    including the findings of the judge in  relation  to  2012/2013,  as  a
    worker and exercising her treaty rights. The application  made  by  the
    appellant was for a residence card only and not for permanent residence
    although I record that it would appear  that  the  appellant  has  been
    residing in the UK as the partner of a  qualified  national  exercising
    treaty rights for the period of 5 years.   I  have  noted  Mr  Melvin's
    written responses but as the issue  is  declaratory  I  find  that  the
    appellant can show that he has been married to an EEA national who  has
    exercised her treaty rights  as  a  qualified  national  and  would  be
    qualified for a permanent residence card under Regulation  15(1)(b)  of
    the EEA Regulations.

19. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified.  I set aside the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007), but  preserve  the  findings  made  in
    respect of earnings and the marriage, and I remake the  decision  under
    section 12(2) (b) (ii) of the TCE 2007  and  I  allow  Younes  Mimoun's
    appeal for the reasons given above.

Order

Appeal Allowed.
