Representation:

For the Appellant:     no appearance
For the Respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Kosovo, known by the above  name  and  by
    numerous aliases.  The respondent made a deportation order against  him
    for reasons explained in a letter dated  21  January  2016,  which,  in
    summary,  are:  his  immigration  history  and  criminal   record;   no
    derivative right of residence under EU law, as his UK citizen  children
    were cared for by their mother, and would not be forced  to  leave  the
    EEA;  under  �398  of  the  immigration  rules,  no   very   compelling
    circumstances, over and above those set  out  at  �399  and  399A;  not
    unduly harsh for his children to live in Kosovo, or to remain in the UK
    without the appellant [�399 (a) (ii)]; and public interest  outweighing
    his right to private and family life.

 2. The appellant appealed to the FtT, on the  grounds  that  it  would  be
    unduly harsh for the children either to live in Kosovo, or to remain in
    the UK without him.

 3. Judge David C Clapham SSC dismissed the appeal for reasons given in his
    decision promulgated on 5 December 2016.

 4. The grounds of appeal stated in an application dated 16  December  2016
    are, in summary:

    Ground (1), error re �399(a): findings unclear on which  paragraphs  of
    the rules they relate to, so that conclusions may have been reached  on
    irrelevant considerations; (2) error finding it not  unduly  harsh  for
    children to remain in the UK, with  regard  to  (i)  no  assessment  of
    medical report on one of the children; (ii)  no  assessment  of  wife's
    evidence of impact on  children  of  appellant's  detention;  (iii)  no
    assessment of wife's evidence she would have to give up  work  or  send
    children to stay for periods with appellant's parents; (3)  no  finding
    on undue harshness of children living in Kosovo.

    Ground 2, error re �397 / 398: deportation  in  breach  of  EU  Charter
    article 24(3), children to have direct contact  with  appellant  unless
    contrary to their interests.

 5. On 31 May 2017 notice was sent to the appellant at his home address, to
    his solicitors and to the respondent of the hearing fixed  for  3  July
    2017 at 10.00 a.m.

 6. By 12.15 p.m. there was no attendance by  or  for  the  appellant.   No
    communication for his solicitors had yet been linked to the file, but I
    was advised that they have withdrawn from acting on  his  behalf.   The
    respondent's information was that he was  still  at  the  address  last
    specified, and  that  he  had  been  reporting  to  the  respondent  in
    compliance  with  conditions,  although   somewhat   erratically.    No
    notification of change of  address  or  other  communication  had  been
    received from him.  In those circumstances, I found it  appropriate  in
    terms of rule 38 to proceed with the hearing in his absence.

 7. Having heard from Mrs Pettersen, I reserved my decision.

 8. There was a stronger case  that  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  for  the
    children to live in Kosovo than that it would be unduly harsh for  them
    to remain in the UK without the appellant.  To succeed,  the  appellant
    had to show both.  The decisive issue in practical terms was the latter
    [�399 (a) (ii) (b)].

 9. The judge came to a clear conclusion  on  that  issue  at  �47,  firmly
    rooted in his other findings and in the evidence which was before  him.
    Ground 1 is in substance no more than disagreement.

10. Ground 2 is far-fetched.  The general presumption in favour of  contact
    between children and  parents  is  reflected  in  the  EU  Charter  and
    throughout family  law,  but  it  does  not  over-ride  the  scheme  of
    deportation established by statute and in the rules.

11. The grounds do not disclose that the making of the decision of the  FtT
    involved the making of any error on a point of law, such that it  ought
    to be set aside.  That decision shall stand.

12. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
