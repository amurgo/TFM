                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008  (SI  2008/2698)  I  make  an  anonymity  order  prohibiting   the
    disclosure or publication of any matter likely to lead  to  members  of
    the public identifying the respondent (TR).  A failure to  comply  with
    this direction could lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.

 2. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State, for  convenience,
    I will hereafter refer to the parties as they appeared before the First-
    tier Tribunal.



Introduction

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka who was born on 5 January 1987.
     He entered the United Kingdom on 12 November 2012 with  a  visa  as  a
    Tier 1 (Post-Study) partner.  On 4 November 2014 the appellant  claimed
    asylum on the basis that he was wanted by the Sri Lankan authorities as
    a perceived supporter of the LTTE.

 4. On 20 April 2015, the Secretary of State refused the appellant's claims
    for asylum, humanitarian protection and under the ECHR.

The Appeal

 5. The appellant appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Judge  Coaster
    dismissed the appellant's appeal on asylum and humanitarian  protection
    grounds.  She rejected the appellant's claim that he was wanted by  the
    Sri Lankan authorities and that he would, as a consequence, be at  risk
    on return.  However, the judge went on to allow the appellant's  appeal
    under Article 3 on the basis that if removed to Sri Lanka it was likely
    that he would commit suicide as a result of his mental health problems.



 6. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal against the  judge's
    finding in favour of the appellant under Article 3 of the ECHR.

 7. On 22 August 2017, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Kelly)  granted  the
    Secretary of State permission to appeal.

 8. The appellant did not seek to appeal the  judge's  adverse  finding  in
    respect of his asylum and humanitarian protection claims.  However,  in
    a rule 24 response dated 9 January 2018, the appellant sought to uphold
    the judge's finding in his favour under Art 3 of the ECHR.

The Judge's Decision

 9. The judge's reasoning in respect of Art 3 is set out at paras 67-79  of
    her determination.  The judge began by  setting  the  scene  concerning
    mental health facilities in Sri Lanka and  summarising,  in  part,  the
    expert psychiatric evidence from Dr  Shivashankar  at  paras  67-69  as
    follows:

         "67. I then assess whether it would be a breach  of  Article  3  to
             return the Appellant to Sri Lanka.  Recent objective  evidence
             'Talking Economics'  the  blog  of  the  Institute  of  Policy
             Studies of Sri Lanka' - a Sri Lankan  social  economic  policy
             think tank document provided at the hearing, shows that  there
             are mental health services in Sri Lanka but they  are  plagued
             by poor funding and a scarcity  of  trained  human  resources.
             The  paper  urges  the  Sri  Lankan  government  to   consider
             providing a comprehensive and integrated  response  to  mental
             health and care  services.   The  paper  does  not  materially
             contradict  GJ   guidance,   contrary   to   the   Appellant's
             submission, nor the  Upper  Tribunal's  finding  on  available
             mental health care in Sri Lanka.

         68.  Dr Shivashankar refers in his latest report to the Appellant's
             recovery being  very  slow  with  some  improvement  and  then
             regression in the community.  It  is  apparent  that  this  is
             because of the possibility of a negative outcome in his asylum
             appeal.   The  Appellant  is  diagnosed  as  having  psychotic
             symptoms in the form of long standing paranoid and persecutory
             beliefs affecting his functioning abilities in  the  community
             including interaction with others.  Dr Shivashankar state that
             the Appellant is scared of  having  to  return  to  Sri  Lanka
             because of his subjective believe that he would be  killed  by
             the Sri Lankan government.

         69.  Dr Shivashankar states that any adverse outcome from the court
             proceedings could again negatively affect  his  mental  health
             with the possible increase in risk to his  health  and  safety
             including suicidal risk.  The prognosis is poor  with  limited
             improvement despite various interventions from the  UK  health
             care authority and medication".

10. Then at paras 70-73, the judge considered the legal approach set out in
    J v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 629 and Y and Z (Sri Lanka) v SSHD [2009] EWCA
    Civ 362 as follows:

         "70. Guided by GJ I have had regard to the six tests set out in J v
             SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 629 summarised in paragraph 450:

             (1)  The ill-treatment relied upon must attain a minimum level
                  of severity such that it is  'an  affront  to  fundamental
                  humanitarian principles  to  remove  an  individual  to  a
                  country where he is at risk of serious ill-treatment': see
                  Ullah paragraphs [38-39];

             (2)  The appellant must show a causal link between the act  or
                  threatened act of removal or  expulsion  and  the  inhuman
                  treatment relied on as violating the applicant's article 3
                  rights.  Examination of the article 3 issue 'must focus on
                  the  foreseeable  consequences  of  the  removal  of   the
                  applicant to Sri Lanka ...';

             (3)  In the context of a foreign case, the article 3 threshold
                  is particularly high simply because it is a foreign  case.
                  And it is even higher where the alleged inhuman  treatment
                  is not the direct or indirect responsibility of the public
                  authorities of the receiving state, but results from  some
                  naturally occurring illness, whether physical or mental.

             (4)  An article 3 claim can in principle succeed in a  suicide
                  case;

             (5)  Where  the  applicant's  fear  of  ill-treatment  in  the
                  receiving state upon which the risk of suicide is said  to
                  be based is not objectively well-founded, that  will  tend
                  to weigh against there being a real risk that the  removal
                  will be in breach of article 3;

             (6)  The decision  maker  must  have  regard  to  whether  the
                  removing  and/or  the  receiving   state   has   effective
                  mechanisms to reduce the risk of suicide.   If  there  are
                  effective mechanisms that too will weigh  heavily  against
                  an applicant's claim that removal will violate his or  her
                  article 3 rights.

         71.  At paragraph 451 GJ also had regard to the observation of Lord
             Justice Sedley in Y (Sri Lanka) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 362, at
             paragraph [16], that

                  '... what may  nevertheless  be  of  equal  importance  is
                  whether  any  genuine  fear  which   the   appellant   may
                  establish, albeit without an objective foundation, is such
                  as to create a risk of suicide if  there  is  an  enforced
                  return'.

         72.  The appellant has not suffered mistreatment in Sri  Lanka  and
             therefore limb 2 of the J v SSHD  tests  has  no  application.
             Under limb 3 the threshold for the Appellant to succeed  in  a
             breach of article 3 is  particularly  high  because  it  is  a
             foreign  case  and  even  higher  where  the  alleged  inhuman
             treatment is not the direct or indirect responsibility of  the
             public authorities of the receiving state,  but  results  from
             some naturally occurring  illness,  physical  or  mental.   In
             respect of limb 5  the  Appellant's  fear  of  return  is  not
             objectively well founded and that weighs against there being a
             real risk of removal being in breach of article 3.

         73.  However, I find the Appellant falls within paragraph 16  of  Y
             (Sri Lanka) v SSHD in that he has no objective foundation  for
             his fear but nevertheless, based on Dr Shavishankar's evidence
             and the  lengthy  and  sustained  mental  ill  health  of  the
             Appellant that there is a risk  of  suicide  if  there  is  an
             enforced return.  This  is  despite  some  evidence  that  the
             Appellant has improved with the significant support of the  UK
             mental health services in the UK such that he is not currently
             suicidal.  The  risk  arises  on  the  prospect  of  a  forced
             return".

11. The judge's reference to GJ is, of  course,  to  the  country  guidance
    decision in GJ and Others (post-civil  war:  returnees)  Sri  Lanka  CG
    [2013] UKUT 319 (IAC).

12. At paras 74-76, the judge considered the appellant's position on return
    to Sri Lanka, in particular whether there would be any adequate  family
    support,  and  the  background  evidence  derived  from  GJ  concerning
    available mental health care in Sri Lanka:

         "74. Although the Appellant could not be said to be suicidal at the
             time of the hearing no doubt due  to  the  NHS  mental  health
             support services, what would be the case in Sri Lanka?  I have
             found that  the  Appellant  has  not  been  honest  about  the
             whereabouts of his mother and there is not necessarily a  lack
             of family support from either his mother or his wife's family.
              However,  I  accept  that  they  are  not  a  substitute  for
             professional medical assistance.

         75.  As to the current situation with mental health services in Sri
             Lanka I have to rely on  the  Country  Guidance  in  GJ  which
             states at paragraphs 454 and 455 the following:

                  '454.    The evidence is that there are  only  25  working
                      psychiatrists in the whole of  Sri  Lanka.   Although
                      there are some mental health facilities in Sri Lanka,
                      at paragraph 4 of the  April  2012  UKBA  Operational
                      Guidance Note on Sri Lanka, it records an observation
                      by Basic Needs that 'money that is  spent  on  mental
                      health only really goes to the  large  mental  health
                      institutions   in   capital   cities,    which    are
                      inaccessible and do not provide appropriate care  for
                      mentally ill people'.

                  455. In the UKBA Country of Origin Report issued in  March
                      2012,  at  paragraph   23.28-23.29,   the   following
                      information is recorded from a BHC letter written  on
                      31 January 2012:

                           '23.28    The  BHC  letter  of  31  January  2012
                               observed that: 'There are  no  psychologists
                               working within the  public  sector  although
                               there are [sic] 1 teaching at the University
                               of Colombo.  There are no numbers  available
                               for psychologists working within the private
                               sector.     There    are    currently     55
                               psychiatrists attached to  the  Ministry  of
                               Health and working across the country'.

         76.  GJ  indicates  that  the  Appellant  is  unlikely  to  receive
             appropriate medical treatment in Sri Lanka.  He  is  diagnosed
             in March 2017 as having a  mental  disorder  in  the  form  of
             Recurrent  Depressive  Disorder,  current  episode  of  Severe
             Depression  with  psychotic  symptoms  in  the  background  of
             difficult social circumstances with financial and  immigration
             difficulties".

13. Then at para 77, the judge quoted from the (then)  recent  decision  of
    the Strasbourg Court in Paposhvili v Belgium (Application no  41738/10)
    [2017] Imm AR 867 concerning the test to be applied in an Art  3  claim
    in a "health case".

14. Then at para 78-79 the judge reached her finding that the appellant had
    established a breach of Art 3 based upon the risk to him of  committing
    suicide on return:

         "78. I note that the Article 3 threshold is very high especially in
             foreign cases, nevertheless I must accept that  Article  3  is
             engaged in this case because it  involves  the  high  risk  of
             suicide on return to Sri Lanka notwithstanding the Appellant's
             lack of an objective  well  founded  fear.   In  this  case  I
             conclude from Dr Shivashankar's  reports  that  the  risk  has
             reached the minimum level of severity and that  the  Appellant
             has shown a link between his removal and the  likely  risk  of
             suicide even though his objective fear is  not  well  founded.
             It remains a fact that  the  receiving  state  does  not  have
             effective mechanisms to reduce the risk.

         79.  I find that the removal of the Appellant would be a breach  of
             Article 3 and therefore unlawful. ...."

The Secretary of State's Challenge

15. Mr Richards, who represented the Secretary of State,  relied  upon  the
    grounds of appeal upon which permission  to  appeal  had  been  granted
    which he expanded upon in his oral submissions.

16. First, he submitted that the judge had been wrong to rely upon the case
    of Paposhvili at para 77 of her determination which, as was established
    by the recent case  of  EA  and  others  (Article  3  medical  cases  -
    Paposhvili not applicable: Afghanistan) [2017] UKUT 445 (IAC)  was  not
    to be followed by the First-tier Tribunal or Upper Tribunal because  of
    the binding decision of the Court of Appeal in GS (India) and Others  v
    SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 40 (as is the House of Lords' decision in N v SSHD
    [2005] UKHL 31) on the appropriate test to be applied when  determining
    whether Art 3 is breached in health cases.

17. Secondly, Mr Richards submitted that the judge's key finding in para 78
    was fundamentally wrong.  The judge had found that there  was  a  "high
    risk of suicide" on return to Sri Lanka but the most recent  report  of
    Dr Shivashankar dated 6 March 2017 did not support that  finding  where
    at para 3.3 it was stated that  the  appellant  had  "no  self-harm  or
    suicidal ideas, no ideas to harm others".  Mr Richards  submitted  that
    all that Dr Shivashankar's report supported was in  para  4  under  the
    heading "Opinion and Recommendations" was that there was  a:  "possible
    increase in risk to his health and safety  including  suicidal  risks".
    There was, Mr Richards submitted, no reference  to  a  "high  risk"  of
    suicide on return to Sri Lanka.

18. Thirdly, Mr Richards submitted that the judge had failed to  assess  Dr
    Shivashankar's evidence in the light of the judge's adverse credibility
    findings in relation to the appellant's asylum claim and  that  he  had
    lied about having lost contact with his mother.   It  was,  Mr  Richard
    submitted, not factored in either by Dr Shivashankar or  by  the  judge
    that the appellant did not even have a genuine subjective fear.

19. Mr Richards submitted that these  errors  fatally  flawed  the  judge's
    finding in the appellant's favour under Art 3.

Discussion

20. First, I will deal with the issue of  whether  the  judge  applied  the
    correct legal approach.  At para 70, as I have set out above, the judge
    set out the six stages in J where the Court of Appeal  articulated  the
    approach to considering whether a breach of Art  3  arose  when  it  is
    contended that an individual is at risk of suicide on return to his own
    country.

21. The judge also  noted  the  variation  to  the  fifth  principle  in  J
    identified by the Court of Appeal  in  Y  and  Z  at  para  71  of  her
    determination.

22. It is plain, in my judgment, that the judge applied the  correct  legal
    approach in paras 70-73 and in reaching her conclusion in para 78  that
    the appellant had established a breach of Art 3.  I do  not  accept  Mr
    Richards' submission that the judge's reference to Paposhvili  in  para
    77 led her to misdirect herself by applying a lower  or  more  generous
    approach to Art 3 in a health case identified by the  Strasbourg  Court
    in Paposhvili by comparison to its earlier decisions in D v  UK  (1997)
    24 EHRR 423 and N v UK (2008) 47 EHRR 39.  It is plain that in para  78
    she correctly identified that there was a "very high"  threshold  under
    Art 3 and, of course, she was concerned with a risk of suicide,  namely
    death which, in itself, does not require any dilution of  the  approach
    in D v UK and N v UK acknowledged in Paposhvili.

23. Secondly, the judge was, in my judgment, entitled to take into account,
    following Y and Z, the subjective fear of the appellant  on  return  to
    Sri Lanka.  Whilst I accept that Y and Z (Sri Lanka) was concerned with
    a case where the background facts were established  but  the  objective
    risk based upon on them was not, this case is not wholly  different  in
    the sense that it is a case where the appellant was wholly disbelieved.
     He was, of course, disbelieved as to much of his claim but,  in  fact,
    the judge accepted that he had been involved in  charitable  and  other
    work which was, in part, an  aspect  of  his  fear  that  it  would  be
    perceived as supporting the LTTE abroad.

24. In any event, a  genuine  subjective  fear,  as  the  Court  of  Appeal
    recognised in Y and Z, can properly be taken into account in  assessing
    whether the appellant has established a real risk of suicide on return.
     Where the individual's whole claim is disbelieved as a fabrication, it
    may well be difficult for that individual to establish that  he  has  a
    genuine belief.  If his claim is a fabrication, it is likely  that  his
    genuine belief to fear the authorities on  return,  such  that  he  may
    commit suicide, is also likely to be a fabrication.   In  this  appeal,
    however, there is no doubt that Dr Shivashankar in his multiple reports
    identified the appellant as suffering from genuine mental illness,  for
    which he has been hospitalised and treated including receiving ECT, and
    that this includes paranoid and persecutory beliefs.  I do  not  accept
    Mr Richards' submission that Dr Shivashankar's opinion and the  Judge's
    findings are flawed because the appellant had  been  found  not  to  be
    credible in respect of his asylum claim (or at  least  largely  so)  or
    whether he has lost contact with his family.  The judge was entitled to
    accept  that  Dr  Shivashankar,  as  a  consultant  psychiatrist,   had
    diagnosed the mental illnesses which created the  paranoid,  delusional
    and genuine persecutory beliefs.

25. I, therefore, reject Mr Richards' submissions that the judge's approach
    to Art 3 was legally flawed.

26. Thirdly, I turn now to Mr Richards' submission that the judge was wrong
    to find that Art 3 was engaged on the basis that there was a "high risk
    of suicide on return" based upon Dr Shivashankar's reports.  There were
    a number of psychiatric reports before the judge which  she  summarised
    at paras 18-22 of her determination as follows:

         "18. On 19th December 2015 Dr Shivashankar stated that the  working
             diagnosis  was  that  the  Appellant  as  suffering  a  mental
             disorder  in  the  form  of  severe  depressive  episode  with
             psychotic symptoms along with co-morbid post-traumatic  stress
             disorder symptoms with ongoing negative cognition and suicidal
             thoughts.  Dr Shivashankar stated  that  the  'treating  team'
             still  believed  that  the  Appellant  is  a  high  risk   for
             completing  his  suicide  considering  his  difficult   social
             circumstances including his legal status  to  remain  in  this
             country.

         19.  On 20th January 2016 Dr Shivashankar  reported  that  although
             the Appellant was slowly making progress with  regard  to  his
             mental illness he still had significant  depressive  and  PTSD
             symptoms.  A formal cognitive examination  15th  January  2016
             had shown significant deficiencies in  attention,  memory  and
             visuo-spacial abilities.  Dr Shivashankar reiterated that  the
             treating team still considered the Appellant to  have  a  high
             suicide risk considering his  difficult  social  circumstances
             including the question of his legal status to remain  in  this
             country.  Again, the Appellant  was,  in  the  opinion  of  Dr
             Shivishankar, not fit to attend legal proceedings.

         20.  On 6th March 2017 Dr Shivanshankar reported in a supplementary
             report for the purpose of these proceedings that the Appellant
             suffers from a  mental  disorder  in  the  form  of  Recurrent
             Depressive Disorder, current episode of Severe Depression with
             psychotic symptoms  in  the  background  of  difficult  social
             circumstances with financial and immigration difficulties.  Dr
             Shivashankar stated  that  he  was  aware  of  his  duties  in
             providing the report to the Tribunal.

         21.  Dr Shivashankar  reports  that  the  Appellant  has  psychotic
             symptoms in the form of long standing paranoid and persecutory
             beliefs affecting his functioning abilities in  the  community
             including interaction with others.  He is scared of having  to
             return to Sri Lanka with the belief that he would be killed by
             the Sri Lankan government.  An adverse outcome from the  court
             proceedings could again negatively affect  his  mental  health
             with possible increase  in  risk  to  his  health  and  safety
             including suicidal risks.  The Appellant's prognosis  is  poor
             considering the way he has been  struggling  with  his  mental
             health difficulties since November 2015 with limited sustained
             benefit from various interventions including in-patient  care,
             biological treatments, medication and extensive course of  ECT
             and input from CRHT and  CMHT.   Given  the  Appellant's  poor
             response to treatment options so far, it is possible  for  him
             to take a longer time before he becomes well and fit to attend
             legal proceedings.

         22.  Dr  Shivashankar  opined  that  the  Appellant  did  not  have
             capacity  to  give  instructions  and   to   withstand   legal
             proceedings".

27. It is  important  to  note  that  the  appellant  has,  throughout  the
    proceedings, been unable to take any  part  by  giving  instruction  or
    giving evidence.  Dr Shivashankar's reports consistently indicate  that
    the appellant's mental health is such that he is not able to take  part
    in legal proceedings.  The appellant clearly suffers, on the  basis  of
    Dr Shivashankar's expert opinion, from serious and severe mental health
    problems.   He  suffers  from  recurrent  depressive  disorder,  severe
    depression with psychotic symptoms.  He has been  hospitalised,  taking
    medication and subject to ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) on  a  number
    of occasions.  The nature of the therapeutic interventions reflects the
    seriousness and severity of the appellant's mental health problems.

28. The evidence of Dr Shivashankar  was,  until  the  appellant  underwent
    treatment over a sustained period of time, that there was high risk  of
    suicide.  By the time of his final report on 6 March 2017, to which  Mr
    Richards referred me, the appellant had been undergoing  treatment  for
    some time and his condition had stabilised.  He  continued  to  receive
    antipsychotic   medication   and    psychological    and    behavioural
    interventions.  It is clear from Dr Shivashankar's report  that  it  is
    the past treatment and continuing  interventions  which  have  produced
    this result.  It is in that context that Dr Shivashankar stated at para
    3.3 that the appellant had "no self-harm  or  suicidal  ideas"  at  the
    present.  Although, he noted that  the  appellant  "continued  to  have
    persecutory delusional beliefs".  In that context also, Dr Shivashankar
    concluded that if the appellant's appeal proceedings were adverse  that
    could: "negatively affect his mental health with possible  increase  in
    risk  to  his  health  and  safety  including  suicidal  risks".    The
    background risk, of course, prior to his treatment was that he was at a
    "high risk" of suicide.

29. In considering the risk to the appellant on return, the judge took into
    account at para 75 of her determination what was said by  the  Tribunal
    in the country guidance case of GJ and Others at [454] and [455]  which
    identified the limited availability of treatment for mental disorder in
    Sri Lanka.  It is, perhaps, worth noting the conclusion reached by  the
    UT in GJ in relation to the third appellant in that case  at  [456]  of
    its determination:

         "456.    We note that the third  appellant  is  considered  by  his
             experienced Consultant Psychiatrist to  have  clear  plans  to
             commit suicide if returned and that he is mentally  very  ill,
             too ill to give reliable evidence.  We approach assessment  of
             his circumstances on the basis that it would be  possible  for
             the respondent to return the  third  appellant  to  Sri  Lanka
             without his coming to harm, but once there, he would be in the
             hands of the Sri Lankan mental health services.  The resources
             in Sri Lanka are sparse and are limited to the cities.  In the
             light of the respondent's own evidence that in  her  OGN  that
             there are facilities only in the cities and that they 'do  not
             provide appropriate care for mentally ill people' and  of  the
             severity of  this  appellant's  mental  illness,  we  are  not
             satisfied  on  the  particular  facts  of  this  appeal,  that
             returning him to Sri Lanka  today  complies  with  the  United
             Kingdom's international obligations under Article 3 ECHR".

30. Here, in my judgment, the judge was entitled to take into  account  the
    background evidence and the likelihood that the appellant would not  be
    able to continue to receive treatment for his clearly diagnosed  mental
    disorders.  In the light of that, it was open to the judge, taking into
    account Dr Shivashankar's past assessment of the risk of suicide by the
    appellant prior to treatment together with  his  present  view  if  the
    appellant were  returned  after  treatment,  to  find  that  the  'high
    threshold' under Art 3 of the ECHR was established, namely  that  there
    was a real risk of the appellant committing suicide on  return  to  Sri
    Lanka.  That risk was, in my judgment, one which the judge was entitled
    to find and  arose  because  of  the  potential  deterioration  in  the
    appellant's mental health if he were removed to Sri Lanka.

31. For these reasons, the judge  did  not  err  in  law  in  allowing  the
    appellant's appeal under Art 3 of the ECHR.

32. Because of her decision in respect of Art 3, Judge Coaster did  not  go
    on to consider whether the appellant's return would breach Art 8 of the
    ECHR.  Neither representative invited me to deal with Art 8 of the ECHR
    if Judge Coaster's decision in respect of Art 3 was sustainable.

Decision

33. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appellant's appeal
    under Art 3 of the ECHR did not involve the making of an error of  law.
    That decision stands.

34. The First-tier Tribunal's decision to dismiss  the  appeal  based  upon
    asylum and humanitarian protection grounds also stands.

35. Accordingly, the Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
    dismissed.

                                                                       [pic]

                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
