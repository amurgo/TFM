Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T D H Hodson, Counsel, instructed by
     Elder Rahimi Solicitors (London)

For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born  on  1  January  1999.   He
    appeals the determination of a First-tier Judge following a hearing  on
    6 July 2017 to dismiss his appeal against a decision of  the  Secretary
    of State to refuse his asylum claim on  18  May  2017.   The  appellant
    entered the UK on 16 September  2015  and  applied  for  asylum  as  an
    unaccompanied minor on 9 October 2015.

2.   Although a point was taken by the Secretary of State  under  Section  8
    of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants,  etc)  Act  2004
    this issue and the issue of the appellant's date of birth were resolved
    in his favour by the First-tier Judge and  there  has  been  no  cross-
    appeal against that aspect of her decision.

3.   The judge helpfully summarised the appellant's claim as follows:

         "In summary the Appellant claims he  is  Pashtoon  and  resided  in
         Bajaur Agency district in Khyber and his father  and  brother  were
         involved in a land dispute with his parenteral  [sic]  uncles,  who
         belonged to the Taliban, they shot  the  uncle  and  kidnapped  the
         Appellant's brother and sister, so he fled  Pakistan  in  September
         2014 (when aged 15 years of age).  The Appellant fears he  will  be
         killed or forcibly recruited by his father's paternal  cousins  who
         belong to the Taliban due to a family  land  dispute  or  that  the
         government will support the  Taliban  in  using  the  Appellant  in
         attacks."

    The judge noted that the identity and nationality of the appellant were
    accepted by the respondent but issue was taken on other  matters.   The
    judge accepted that the appellant was a minor when he had completed his
    SEF Form and had submitted his first witness statement but was an adult
    at the date of his substantive asylum interview.  In  paragraph  36  of
    her decision the judge concluded:

         "The core of the Appellant's account is attended by such  vagueness
         as to cast serious doubt  upon  its  credibility.   The  cumulative
         effect of all these serious causes for concern is such as to  cause
         me to conclude that the Appellant has failed to submit satisfactory
         evidence to establish, even to the standard of a reasonable  degree
         of probability, that his factual account is true.  I therefore make
         a finding of credibility adverse to the Appellant in respect of the
         entirety of his account."

4.   The challenge in this case  is  to  the  judge's  negative  credibility
    assessment.  A large part of her reasoning is set out in bullet  points
    in paragraph 33 of her decision.

5.   Argument focussed in particular on the first of  the  judge's  reasons,
    and it is convenient to set out the first  two  bullet  points  as  the
    reasoning is to an extent connected.

         .    Although having been in the care of  social  services,  having
             the legal services of an adviser throughout these proceedings,
             and also advised  during  his  substantive  interview  by  the
             Respondent to seek the support of the Red  Cross/Red  Crescent
             to access  contact  with  his  family,  it  appears  that  the
             Appellant has failed to do  so.   Although  asserting  he  has
             contacted the Red  Cross/Red  Crescent  no  letters  of  other
             documentary evidence  are  before  me  to  support  this  mere
             assertion.  I simply do not accept that his uncle  would  have
             paid an agent about ï¿½4,346 to bring the Appellant specifically
             to the UK (despite having no family here) without arranging  a
             conduit of communication to confirm the Appellant arrived here
             safely.  Nor do I accept  that  the  Appellant  is  unable  to
             recall any telephone number of his numerous maternal uncles or
             his own parents in order to contact them, or to merely send  a
             letter to them at the family home in order  to  contact  them.
             This claim is simply implausible considering the access  to  a
             lawyer and social worker and foster carers that the  Appellant
             has and the professional support he has received from them, in
             an area of the country that is fully conversant with the issue
             of unaccompanied asylum seeking children.

         .    If he had contacted his family directly, the identity cards he
             claims to have and those of his father he  would  have  access
             to, would have been easily accessible.  More  pertinently  the
             death certificate and will of his  grandfather  regarding  who
             inherited the  family  land,  the  death  certificate  of  his
             maternal uncle claimed to be shot, and also letters or support
             or witness statement could have been obtained from his parents
             and uncles to confirm that the shooting of the  uncle  by  the
             Turbur/Taliban uncles occurred.  That this simple task was not
             undertaken from 16 September 2015 to date of hearing on 6 July
             2017, a period of one year and nigh on  10  months,  tends  to
             significantly undermine the claims of the Appellant."

6.   In the grounds of appeal against the judge's decision  the  appellant's
    solicitor filed a witness statement dated 10 August  2017.   There  had
    been an appointment with the appellant on 9 September 2016 in which the
    appellant had  agreed  for  her  to  contact  the  Red  Cross,  and  an
    attendance note and an e-mail received from the  Red  Cross  confirming
    the on-line request for international family tracing had been received.
     After the judge's determination the appellant had  said  that  he  had
    asked his friend to forward an  e-mail  attaching  the  letter  he  had
    received from the Red Cross dated 20 April 2017.  The solicitor records
    that during the meeting she discovered the e-mail  and  the  attachment
    had been sent to her junk mail which was the reason why  this  was  not
    received and put before the Tribunal.  The Tribunal Judge had taken the
    view that the appellant did not contact  the  Red  Cross  "however  the
    attached evidence is confirmation that he did in fact do so ... ".   In
    the grounds although it was accepted that the judge was not aware  that
    the letter existed reliance was placed on MM (Unfairness; E & R)  Sudan
    [2014] UKUT 00105 (IAC).  It was argued that the facts of  the  instant
    appeal and that case was similar in that a letter from the  appellant's
    solicitors to the Home Office containing a list  of  clarifications  to
    the appellant's asylum interview was omitted from the  appellant's  and
    respondent's bundles.  Even though the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  was
    unaware of this, the finding that the  appellant  had  lied  about  the
    letter could not stand due to  procedural  unfairness.   Reference  was
    made to paragraph 24 of the decision:

         "The judge, in terms, found the appellant to be mendacious and this
         became  one  of  the  important  building  blocks  in  his  overall
         assessment  that  her  claims  were  not  worthy  of  belief.   The
         resulting unfairness to the appellant is palpable."

    A number of other points were taken in the grounds.  It was  said  that
    the judge had not dealt properly with the expert report compiled by  Dr
    Giustozzi.  This had been dealt with  after  the  negative  credibility
    findings that had been made in paragraph 33.  The judge had erroneously
    compartmentalised the expert evidence and had failed to consider it  in
    the round.  Country background evidence was particularly important when
    assessing the evidence of a minor.  The judge had  erroneously  assumed
    that death and birth certificates would exist in  written  form  or  be
    obtainable which the appellant had never asserted.  The judge had  made
    various  mistakes  in  assessing  the  appellant's  evidence  and   had
    misunderstood the evidence provided in the second  of  the  appellant's
    witness statements in finding this "raises more extreme issues, such as
    villagers being beheaded and forced to pay money to the Taliban,  which
    included his uncles".  It was pointed out that the appellant's  witness
    statement in fact made no mention of anyone being forced to  pay  money
    to the Taliban: the reference was actually to the Taliban paying  money
    to families in return for their sons.  The  evidence  about  beheadings
    did not relate to the Taliban - the appellant was  actually  describing
    the outcome of other land disputes  in  his  village.   The  point  was
    intended as context and was not an attempt  to  import  more  "extreme"
    elements into the appellant's claim.

7.   Among other points the judge had found that there had been no  catalyst
    for the appellant's departure from Pakistan  and  this  "defies  common
    sense".  The obvious catalyst was the kidnap of the  appellant's  older
    brother and sister and also that the Turbur had said that  they  wanted
    the appellant to join them.

8.   In relation to the ages of  the  appellant's  siblings  the  judge  had
    commented that the appellant was vague on whether they  were  older  or
    younger than him.  The appellant had in fact set out the  ages  of  his
    siblings in his witness statement.  Moreover dates were unimportant  in
    the appellant's country.

9.   The judge had gone on to find after  making  her  negative  credibility
    assessment that the appellant would not  be  at  risk  upon  return  to
    Pakistan and accordingly issues of relocation did not  arise.   However
    she noted in paragraph 38 that the appellant would have the support  of
    all his family and would be able to relocate and would  integrate  back
    into the Pakistan community upon return.  A point was made that  issues
    of internal relocation and  sufficiency  of  protection  had  not  been
    raised by the respondent in the refusal letter and there  had  been  no
    Presenting Officer before the First-tier  Judge.   The  judge  had  not
    raised the issue of sufficiency of protection at the hearing  according
    to Counsel previously instructed.

10.  In granting permission to appeal the Upper Tribunal commented that  the
    document from the Red Cross could not be deciphered and a readable copy
    should be provided if the point were to be made  good.   Permission  to
    appeal was granted although no view was expressed as  to  the  ultimate
    outcome.

11.  At the hearing Mr Hodson gave Ms Holmes the best copy he could  of  the
    Red Cross letter which  was  dated  20  April  2017.   Having  had  the
    opportunity to study the material Ms Holmes accepted that the appellant
    had contacted the Red Cross as claimed.

12.  There was an e-mail from the Red Cross  on  9  September  2016  to  the
    appellant thanking him  for  submitting  a  request  for  international
    family tracing.

13.  The judge had concentrated on this issue in the  first  of  her  bullet
    points to which I have referred above.  Counsel  submitted  that  there
    was "a definite air of  disbelief"  when  considering  the  appellant's
    evidence.  It had in fact been true that the  appellant  had  contacted
    the Red Cross as long ago as September 2016 - nine  months  before  the
    hearing.  There had been procedural unfairness  which  had  caused  the
    judge to start with a negative perspective which had coloured the  rest
    of her findings.  There had been no Presenting Officer  to  assist  the
    judge in focussing on the salient issues.  There had been no  challenge
    to the documentary evidence.  In relation to the expert report  Counsel
    submitted that  the  judge's  approach  had  been  uncomplimentary  and
    hostile and dismissive and it had been dealt with  after  the  negative
    credibility assessment.  The credibility findings should have been made
    after properly considering the expert report.  The report  should  have
    been considered in the round.  The judge had  been  distracted  by  the
    issue of blood feuds.  Counsel took me to the evidence in  relation  to
    the point made by the judge that the appellant had contradicted himself
    by saying that his father held the title to the disputed land where  it
    was clear that the appellant had always said that his father  held  the
    title.  In his first witness statement dated 9  September  2016  -  the
    same date as contact had been made with the Red Cross - it was apparent
    that the land was in the appellant's father's name.  The same was clear
    from the appellant's interview.  Reference was also made to the  recent
    witness statement of the appellant in relation to the  finding  by  the
    judge that it raised more extreme issues.   The  judge  had  adopted  a
    scatter gun approach.  In relation  to  the  ages  of  the  appellant's
    siblings and the finding that the appellant was  vague  there  was  the
    worrying sense that the judge had not  gone  back  and  looked  at  the
    appellant's statement.  There were enough underlying  errors  to  cause
    concern.

14.  While Ms Holmes acknowledged that internal flight had not  been  raised
    as an issue in the refusal letter there was a need to look at the  risk
    all over the country. This was an obvious point and had been raised  by
    the appellant in his second statement and moreover it was raised in the
    expert report and it was incumbent on the judge to deal with it.

15.  In relation to the Red Cross issue it was accepted that  the  appellant
    had contacted the Red Cross and there is no reason  why  the  appellant
    who had given evidence before the First-tier Judge should not have been
    believed on this issue.

16.  However Ms Holmes pointed out that the judge had not  accepted  matters
    such as the uncle paying an agent over  ï¿½4,000.   In  relation  to  the
    documentary evidence referred to in the second bullet point  Ms  Holmes
    referred to TK (Burundi) [2009] EWCA Civ 40 - the judge was entitled to
    take into account the failure to provide evidence which was  or  should
    have been readily available.  A major credibility issue had been raised
    in the third bullet point concerning a discrepancy  in  the  chronology
    provided by the appellant.  The judge had been  entitled  to  find  the
    appellant vague having taken  into  account  his  level  of  education.
    There was no perversity as claimed in  the  judge's  reasoning  in  the
    seventh bullet point.  It was accepted that the judge had made a slight
    mistake - as Ms Holmes put it - in her reference to what was said to be
    more extreme issues in the appellant's recent statement.  The appellant
    as she put it, had "raised the tone" and had brought in  the  issue  of
    beheading.

17.  A point had been raised about the expert's report  referring  to  blood
    feuds but this was apposite in  relation  to  the  recently  introduced
    claim.

18.  In conclusion although there were flaws  in  the  credibility  findings
    these were minor.  They were small misunderstandings and not sufficient
    to undermine the overall negative credibility assessment.

19.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Judge if it was materially flawed in law.

20.  I bear in mind that the appellant was  a  minor  at  the  date  of  the
    events on which he relied to found his claim.  Anxious scrutiny has  to
    be applied in all asylum cases and in particular  to  a  case  such  as
    this.

21.  I appreciate that the judge in paragraph  21  of  her  decision  states
    that the order of addressing matters was not indicative of any relative
    amount of weight attached but was adopted for convenience.  However  it
    is particularly unfortunate that the judge  commenced  her  credibility
    assessment with a finding which is conceded to be based upon an  error.
    In fact what the appellant was saying was perfectly truthful and he had
    indeed contacted the Red Cross and the Red Cross  had  responded.   The
    initial approach had been acknowledged as Counsel submits  many  months
    before the hearing in September 2016.

22.  Although the order of findings may not ordinarily be of significance  I
    accept Counsel's submission that this particular flaw set the judge off
    on the wrong foot.  It is not unconnected with the findings made in the
    second bullet point and may have coloured her  subsequent  approach  to
    the evidence.  I accept that the First-tier Judge was not to blame  for
    the assumption that there was no evidence to  support  the  appellant's
    account but the finding on this particular issue does  appear  to  have
    assumed some importance in the judge's overall approach.

23.  Ms Holmes referred to TK (Burundi) and what is said in paragraph 16  of
    the judgment of Thomas LJ is of relevance:

         "Where evidence to support an account given by a party is or should
         readily be available, a judge is, in my view  plainly  entitled  to
         take into account the failure to  provide  that  evidence  and  any
         explanations  for  that  failure.   This  may  be   a   factor   of
         considerable weight in relation  to  credibility  where  there  are
         doubts about the credibility of a party for other reasons.  ... "

24.  Unfortunately, as is now accepted,  the  point  was  a  bad  one.   The
    evidence to support  the  appellant's  account  had  ended  up  in  his
    solicitor's junk e-mail.

25.  Reliance is placed by the appellant on MM (Sudan), a  decision  chaired
    by the President.  The headnote reads as follows:

         "1.  Where there is a defect or impropriety of a procedural  nature
             in the proceedings at first instance, this  may  amount  to  a
             material error of law requiring the decision of the First-Tier
             Tribunal to be set aside.

         (2)  A successful appeal is not dependent on the  demonstration  of
             some failing on the part of the First-tier Tribunal.  Thus  an
             error of law may be found to have  occurred  in  circumstances
             where some material evidence, through no fault of  the  First-
             tier Tribunal, was not considered, with  resulting  unfairness
             (E & R v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2004]
             EWCA Civ 49)."

26.  As in this case, MM (Sudan),  raised  the  question  of  errors  by  an
    appellant's representative.     The  President  stated  as  follows  at
    paragraph 25:


             "The pivotal importance of the error of fact  upon  which  the
             reasoning of the judge was demonstrably based helps to explain
             why, in appeals raising issues  of  international  protection,
             there is room for departure from an inflexible application  of
             common law rules and principles where  this  is  necessary  to
             redress unfairness. This is especially so where the respondent
             has, in the words of Carnwath LJ in E  &  R,  paragraph  [66],
             failed to co-operate to achieve a correct result. As  we  have
             seen, generally, the first of the Ladd v  Marshall  principles
             requires that the new evidence which was not considered at the
             earlier hearing could not with reasonable diligence have  been
             obtained at that stage.  Plainly  that  cannot  be  said  here
             because the letter was written by the very solicitors who were
             presenting  the  case  before  the  Tribunal  and  so  it  was
             available. It is established that  neither  the  rule  in  Al-
             Mehdawi v SSHD [1990] 1 AC  876  (that  a  procedural  failure
             caused by an appellant's own representative did not lead to an
             appeal being in breach of the rules of natural justice) nor  a
             failure to meet the first of the Ladd  v  Marshall  principles
             applies with full rigour in asylum and human  rights  appeals:
             see, e.g. FP (Iran) v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 13.   The  decision
             of the Court of Appeal in E & R v Secretary  of  State  points
             towards a broader approach, in which the common law right to a
             fair hearing predominates.  We consider that this appeal  must
             succeed accordingly."

27.  Ms Holmes did not argue against this approach but  submitted  that  the
    reasoning of the judge when read as a whole was not undermined by  this
    or other failings.

28.  While some of the points  made  in  the  decision  when  looked  at  in
    isolation are arguably sustainable there are concerns with  aspects  of
    the factual findings as highlighted by Counsel.  It is accepted  by  Ms
    Holmes that apart from the unfairness issue there  are  other  possible
    errors or "misunderstandings". These may have sent  the  judge  on  the
    wrong course when considering other matters.  She  was  of  course  not
    assisted by the absence of a Presenting Officer  who  might  have  been
    able to  clarify  to  what  extent  the  questions  of  sufficiency  of
    protection and internal relocation were relied upon.

29.  For the reasons I have given I am satisfied that  the  outcome  of  the
    appeal  was  tainted  by  unfairness  given  among  other  things   the
    appellant's young age and the need for anxious scrutiny in these cases.
     The determination is affected by a material error of law.  As  I  have
    said there is no cross-appeal from the finding  about  the  appellant's
    date of birth and the finding in that respect is not  affected  by  the
    error of law.

Notice of Decision

G Warr, Judge of the Upper Tribunal
