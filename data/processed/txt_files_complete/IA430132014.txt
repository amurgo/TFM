Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Fisher (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Somal, promulgated on 20th January 2015, following the hearing at
    Nottingham on 15th January  2015.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    allowed the appeal of Samuel Larbi.  The Respondent Secretary of State,
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of  Ghana,  who  was  born  on  14th
    October 1962.  He appealed  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State dated 13th October 2014, rejecting  his  application
    to remain in the UK as a the partner of a British citizen wife,  namely
    Ms Thembani Eunice Dube, a person present and settled in the UK because
    he could not meet the  financial  requirements  test  and  the  English
    language requirements.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge was satisfied that the  financial  threshold  requirement  of
    ï¿½18,600 for a couple was met because,

         "He has produced the required documentary evidence to confirm this.
          He has produced evidence to show the amount of tax  payable,  paid
         and unpaid for the last financial  year,  his  SA302  statement  of
         account  and  evidence  of  his  ongoing  self-employment   through
         evidence of payment of class 2 NI contributions  as  shown  by  his
         bank statement and evidence of direct debits for  NI  paid  to  the
         HMRC made from his bank account" (paragraph 11).

 4. With respect to the English requirement test, however,  the  judge  was
    less persuaded holding that,

         "However, I do not find the Appellant has shown he has  passed  the
         English language test requirements as he has  provided  an  English
         certificate from EMDQ, which is not on  the  Secretary  of  State's
         list of approved providers.  I find the Appellant cannot  meet  the
         requirements under the five year route as a partner  as  he  cannot
         meet the English language requirements" (see paragraph 11).

 5. Nevertheless, the judge did find both the Appellant and the Sponsor "to
    be honest and credible".  She found  them  to  be  "in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship" and there were photographs produced to confirm
    this.  They had been in a relationship since 2011 and had then moved in
    together and got married.

 6. It was against this background, that the judge held that,

         "There are insurmountable obstacles to family life with his partner
         continuing outside the UK, as she is a British citizen and all  her
         family live in the UK.  It would be unreasonable for him to  return
         as he has lived in the UK for  almost  ten  years,  although  I  am
         mindful that he has spent the vast majority of his life  in  Ghana.
         The Appellant has a wife and is married having been in a long  term
         and stable relationship ... .  She has  a  long-standing  full-time
         job and has no connection with Ghana.  She is not  from  Ghana  and
         she has never been to Ghana ..." (paragraph 12).

    The judge did give consideration  to  whether  the  relationship  would
    continue "with indirect contact and visits from the  Sponsor  and  vice
    versa" (paragraph 13) but rejected this as being impracticable.

 7. The appeal was allowed.

The Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state that the judge erred in  allowing  the
    appeal on the basis that Section  EX.1  was  to  be  treated  as  free-
    standing.  The case of Sabir [2014] UKUT 00063 has confirmed that it is
    not free-standing.  If an Appellant does not meet the  requirements  of
    the Rules, then compelling circumstances have to be established for the
    purposes of Article 8.  The fact that the Appellant failed to meet  the
    requirements of the relevant Immigration Rules (as he  failed  to  meet
    the English language test) meant that the compelling circumstances  had
    to be properly shown and they were not.

 9. On 3rd March 2015, permission to appeal was granted on the  basis  that
    Gulshan [2013] UKUT 640 establishes the correct approach and compelling
    circumstances have to be established for the  purposes  of  Article  8.
    The judge had misdirected herself when assessing proportionality.

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 8th May 2015, Mr Avery, appearing on behalf
    of the Respondent Secretary  of  State,  relied  upon  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal.  He submitted that the judge had failed to demonstrate  in  her
    reasoning what was compelling or exceptional part of these facts,  such
    that the Rules did not fall to be applied in their normal manner.   The
    Rules are a strict code.  The circumstances identified by the  Tribunal
    cannot be said to be compelling or exceptional.  The Appellant may well
    have a British citizen wife and she may be in employment, and  she  may
    have  family  here,  but  these  are  not  obstacles   preventing   her
    relocation.  English was spoken in Ghana.  She could obtain  employment
    there.  Moreover, the Appellant himself could return to Ghana.  He  had
    a lengthy stay there.  He had spent the majority of his life in  Ghana.
    His youth and formative years had  been  spent  there.   He  was  fully
    familiar with its culture and customs.   There  is  nothing  about  his
    private life that cannot be continued in Ghana and his position in  the
    UK was always precarious such that paragraph 117B  of  the  Immigration
    Act 2014 militated against him.

11. For her part, Ms Fisher  submitted  that  the  essential  question  was
    whether the judge had fallen into making an error of law.  She had not.
     She drew my attention to her skeleton argument.   She  suggested  that
    the judge had given sufficient reasons.  Furthermore, in  the  case  of
    Boultiff  v  Switzerland  [2001]  the  Strasbourg   Court   had   held,
    particularly in a deportation case, that it would not be reasonable for
    a wife to relocate to Algeria as a Swiss national, even though she  did
    speak French because, "The applicant's wife has never lived in Algeria,
    she has no other ties with that  country  and  indeed  does  not  speak
    Arabic" (paragraph 53).  Ms Fisher suggested that this was  a  complete
    answer to the appeal by the Secretary of State.

12. Second, the objective evidence from the COIS Report highlights the high
    unemployment rate amongst women in Ghana.  The  Ghana  web  article  of
    16th July 2011 is headed, "The growing unemployment  crisis  in  Ghana"
    and refers to how, "The worst  affected  groups  of  the  Ghanaian  job
    crisis include women, young people, the disabled and the elderly".  The
    judge was right to have taken this into account.  Third, the Respondent
    had relied upon the case of Sabir to assert that  EX.1  was  not  free-
    standing.  However, the Appellant did meet EX.1 and the Respondent  had
    erred in relying on Sabir.  The Appellant met E-LTRP2.2(b) and that  he
    must not be in breach of the Immigration Rules unless EX.1 applies.  He
    met the eligibility criteria.  He also met the  financial  requirements
    set out in E-LTRP3.1, 3.2.

13. Finally, it was not the case that the Rules  here  are  a  strict  code
    because in Ganesabalan [2014] EWHC 2712 the court had established  that
    unlike  other  Rules  which  have  a  built-in  discretion   based   no
    exceptional circumstances, Appendix  FM  and  Rule  276ADE  are  not  a
    "complete code" so far as Article 8 is concerned.  This meant that  the
    judge was correct in applying the Rules as she  did.   As  for  Section
    117B of the 2014 Act this had plainly been taken into  account  by  the
    judge.

No Error of Law

14. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  My  reasons  are
    as follows.  In Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ 440, handed down by  the  Court
    of Appeal only two days earlier on 6th  May  2015,  Sales  LJ  observed
    that,

         "The phrase 'insurmountable obstacles' as used in this paragraph of
         the Rules clearly imposes a  high  hurdle  to  be  overcome  by  an
         applicant for leave  to  remain  under  the  Rules.   The  test  is
         significantly more demanding than a mere test of whether  it  would
         be reasonable to expect a couple  to  continue  their  family  life
         outside the United Kingdom" (see paragraph 21).

15. Sales LJ was referring to Section EX.1.  However, on the facts of  this
    case, the judge had clearly found that the Appellant's wife would  meet
    with "insurmountable obstacles" because  she  had  no  connection  with
    Ghana, had never been to Ghana, and had a stable and long term  job  in
    the UK, where her entire family resided (paragraph  13).   That  was  a
    finding which, on the facts of the case, was open to the judge.

16. Second, this line of reasoning  is  not  inconsistent  with  Strasbourg
    jurisprudence because in Boultiff v  Switzerland  [2001]  the  European
    Court of Human Rights had held, in relation to a Swiss  national  wife,
    that she also faced insurmountable obstacles to relocating to  Algeria,
    even though she spoke French, given  that  "Wife  has  never  lived  in
    Algeria, she has no other ties with that country, and indeed  does  not
    speak Arabic" (paragraph 53).  Third, it is clear that  the  judge  has
    given sufficient reasoning.

17. The Tribunal in Budhathoki [2014] UKUT 00341 has held that,

         "It is generally unnecessary and unhelpful for First-tier  Tribunal
         judgments to rehearse every detail or issues raised in a case.  ...
          It is, however, necessary for judges to identify and  resolve  key
         conflicts in the evidence and explain  in  clear  and  brief  terms
         their reasons ...."

18. This the judge had clearly  done.   Fourth,  if  the  Appellant's  wife
    cannot relocate to Ghana, then there are  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life with  that  party  continuing  outside  the  UK,  and  this
    satisfies the requirements of EX.1.

19. Finally, the judge was correct to interpret the Article 8 jurisprudence
    as she did because Appendix FM and Rule  276ADE  are  not  a  "complete
    code" as has been established in Ganesabalan [2014] EWHC  2712.   There
    is no prior threshold which dictates whether the exercise of discretion
    should be considered. In this case, the judge was  satisfied  that  the
    basis for the exercise of discretion had been put forward.

Notice of Decision

There is no material error of law in the  original  judge's  decision.   The
determination shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
