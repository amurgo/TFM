                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is the appeal of Ms Sobnom  against  the  decision  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer of 13  August  2012  refusing  an  application  under
    paragraph 281 of HC 395 which she  made  to  enable  her  to  join  her
    husband  Mr Ali  who is a British citizen.

2.   The appeal was dismissed under the Immigration Rules on  the  basis  of
    maintenance and the judge made calculations which led him  to  conclude
    that the income was not enough to provide  adequately  for  maintenance
    and subsequently issue has been  taken with the calculation made by the
    judge in that regard because there were arrears of rent  that  required
    to be paid and so there were two separate payments being  made  to  the
    landlord.

3.   It seems in the end we do  not have to  go  into  that  issue  and  the
    question of whether there was evidence before the judge in relation  to
    that because as ground 2 makes clear, even if the  judge's  calculation
    was correct and there was a shortfall of �8 a  week,  the  sponsor  had
    something slightly over �1,240 worth of savings  at  the  time  of  the
    application and if one divides that out over the 24 months  that  would
    be required to be done then it is clear, as  was  common  ground,  that
    there was enough by some �400 to make up the shortfall and  enable  the
    requirements of the Rules on maintenance to be met.

4.   As a consequence the appeal succeeds.
