                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss S Iqbal, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, HOPO


                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW

1.   The appellants are a mother  and  daughter  and  are  citizens  of  the
    Philippines.  They have been granted permission to appeal the  decision
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Miller who dismissed their appeal  against
    the decision of the respondent to refuse them leave to  remain  on  the
    basis of their family and private life.  The application was refused on
    26 March 2013.  The principal appellant came to the UK  in  2004  as  a
    student.  Her leave to remain as a student was extended on a number  of
    occasions until 29 February 2012.  Her daughter, the second  appellant,
    was born in 2008 in the UK.  The child at the date of  the  application
    was 7ï¿½ years and at the date of the hearing was 8 years old.

2.   Both parties agreed that  the  judge  adopted  the  wrong  approach  in
    dismissing the appeal under Article.  The judge  failed  to  place  the
    child or the Section 55 consideration at the centre  of  his  decision.
    What the judge did was to consider the circumstances of  the  principal
    appellant and consequently his conclusions were heavily weighted on the
    fact that the principal appellant came to the UK in 2004 as  a  student
    with no expectation at that time that she would not have to  return  to
    the Philippines.  I agree with the grant of permission  that  paragraph
    24, the first paragraph of the judge's conclusions were damning of  the
    first appellant and her immigration  history  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    That set the tone for the conclusions that followed.

3.   It is evident under the respondent's guidance that strong reasons  will
    be required in order to refuse a case with continuous UK  residence  of
    more than seven years.  That principle has been adopted by the Court of
    Appeal in MA Pakistan. It was apparent from the decision that the judge
    failed to apply the  principles  in  MA  Pakistan.   Consequently,  the
    judge's approach was flawed and his decision could not stand.

4.   I had to remit this case because  it  appears  that  there  is  further
    evidence in respect of the child's medical condition which needs to  be
    updated.  There were also factual errors  in  the  judge's  finding  at
    paragraph 24.  For these reasons, I could not go  ahead  and  determine
    the appeal myself.

5.   Accordingly, the appellant's  appeal  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be heard at Taylor House by a judge other  than  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Miller.

No anonymity direction is made.
