For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No representation, appeared in person


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. This is the respondent's appeal from a decision of First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Buckwell.  For ease of reference, throughout this determination I
    shall refer to the Secretary of State, who was the original  respondent
    as "the Secretary of State" and to Ms Gacutan,  who  was  the  original
    appellant, as "the claimant".

 2. The claimant, who was born on 19 April  1990,  is  a  national  of  the
    Philippines, who first arrived in this country  on  20  September  2009
    with leave to enter until  4  October  2010,  subject  to  a  condition
    restricting employment and prohibiting recourse to public  funds.   She
    was subsequently granted leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study  work)
    Migrant from 26 August 2010 until 26 August 2012,  without  restricting
    employment but prohibiting recourse to public funds.

 3. Before the expiry of that leave, in an application dated 6 August 2012,
    the claimant applied for a variation  and  extension  of  her  existing
    leave to enable her to complete an MSc course as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student.

 4. The claimant's application was refused by the Secretary of State  on  1
    November 2012, because the Secretary of State found that  the  claimant
    had not satisfied the  financial  requirements  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The Secretary of State also decided that the claimant should be
    removed to the Philippines by way of directions, pursuant to Section 47
    of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 5. The claimant appealed against this decision and her  appeal  was  heard
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Buckwell, sitting at Taylor House on 4
    March 2013.  Her grounds of appeal included a claim with  reference  to
    Article 8 of the ECHR.  It was common ground between the  parties  that
    insofar as the removal decision was  made  contemporaneously  with  the
    substantive decision, this was not in accordance with the law.

 6. In a determination dated 13 March 2013  and  promulgated  on  21  March
    2013, Judge Buckwell dismissed the claimant's substantive appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules, but allowed it on human rights grounds,  Article
    8.

 7.  The  Secretary  of  State  has  appealed  against  this  decision  and
    permission to appeal was granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Grant-
    Hutchison on 10 April 2013.  In setting out her  reasons  for  granting
    permission to appeal, Judge Grant-Hutchison stated as follows:

         "...3.   The judge noted that the  Appellant  could  not  meet  the
             immigration rules and at para 25 of his Demonstration he finds
             'As a matter of fact she was unable to  demonstrate  that  and
             the evidence before me so confirmed'.  The judge  relied  only
             on the case of CDS Brazil [2010] UKUT 305  in  coming  to  his
             decision.  It is arguable that the judge did not give adequate
             reasons for relying on said case particularly in light of  the
             fact that in that case the appellant had the appropriate funds
             available and there had been a change to the rules."



The Hearing

 8. I was addressed on behalf of the Secretary of State by Mr Wilding,  who
    first of all made submissions as to why Judge Buckwell's  determination
    should be set aside.  I then heard evidence from the  claimant  and  Mr
    Wilding was offered, but declined,  the  opportunity  to  cross-examine
    her.  I recorded the proceedings contemporaneously, and as this  record
    is set out in my Record of Proceedings,  I  shall  not  set  out  below
    everything which was said to me during the course of the  hearing,  but
    shall refer only to such part of the submissions  and  evidence  as  is
    necessary for the purposes of this  determination.   I  have,  however,
    taken into consideration everything which was said  to  me  during  the
    hearing, as well as all the documents contained within the file.

 9. Mr Wilding submitted that the material error  of  law  was  that  Judge
    Buckwell had effectively decided this appeal by applying the principles
    of a "near miss" and had put too much weight on the fact that this  was
    a "near miss", at  paragraph  29  of  the  determination.   What  Judge
    Buckwell was essentially saying was that although the claimant did  not
    satisfy the requirements under the Rules, because there were more  than
    sufficient funds available, the decision was disproportionate.  He also
    placed emphasis on the case of CDS (Brazil), although this decision had
    fallen  away  in  significance,  especially  since  it  had  been  made
    abundantly clear in the Court of Appeal decision in  Miah  [2012]  EWCA
    Civ 261 that "a miss is as good as a mile".  Also, Judge  Buckwell  had
    failed to appreciate the considerable distinction between the facts  in
    CDS (Brazil) and the facts in this case, because in CDS (Brazil)  there
    had been a recent change in the Rules  and  the  issue  was  whether  a
    certain type of family member could sponsor a relative or not.  In this
    case, the claimant had been required to show that  she  had  a  sum  of
    money available to her which she had  not  done.   Although  there  was
    nothing detrimental in her personal history,  the  policy  reasons  for
    enforcing the Rules were clear.  The points-based system  was  designed
    in part to prevent people from forever switching  categories  which  is
    what this claimant was seeking to do.  She needed to  show  �24,855  in
    available funds but the bank statements submitted showed no  more  than
    �20,000, so she was over �4,000 short.  At paragraph 29, Judge Buckwell
    was not saying there was other evidence, but he took  a  holistic  view
    that �20,000 was enough bearing in mind she was only here  for  another
    few months.  The final sentence at paragraph 29  seemed  to  be  saying
    this.

10. If one looked at the claimant's witness statement, she seemed to accept
    that position.  At paragraph 5 she states that she was of the  mistaken
    impression that she only had to show she had requisite funds for  three
    months, at paragraph 8.  She accepts that she needed to show  that  she
    had more funds available than she in fact showed.  It was the Secretary
    of State's submission that what this judge had done  was  to  say  that
    although she did not meet the requirements of the Rules, because it was
    a "near miss" he could allow the appeal  under  Article  8.   This  was
    precisely what the Court of Appeal had said in Miah could not be  done.



11. It was accepted on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State  that  if  this
    Tribunal were to find an error of law, it would then have  to  consider
    the situation as it was now,  but  it  was  the  Secretary  of  State's
    submission that it was not disproportionate to expect someone  to  meet
    the requirements of the Rules.  Unlike the situation in  CDS  (Brazil),
    where there had been a change in the Rules, in this case those  factors
    did not apply.  This claimant had come  here  to  study  and  had  then
    varied her leave, and this was her first application to  go  back  into
    the category of a student.  In order to succeed in her application  she
    needed to show that the requirements of the Rules were  satisfied.   It
    was the Secretary of State's  submission  that  an  error  of  law  was
    established, and that the Secretary  of  State's  decision  was  not  a
    disproportionate one.

12. In my judgment, there was a material error of law in  Judge  Buckwell's
    determination, in that his finding at paragraph 29 that "there are more
    than sufficient funds provided by the claimant's parents to  cover  all
    costs of fees and maintenance" is not adequately reasoned.  Nor is  his
    statement that "there  is  absolutely  no  doubt  whatsoever  that  the
    claimant would  be  in  no  financial  difficulty  in  respect  of  the
    sufficiency of maintenance until her course is concluded".  Given  that
    the only evidence which is referred to within the determination  is  of
    the money that was shown in the bank accounts, which was not sufficient
    to show adequate maintenance under the Rules, and that as at  the  date
    of Judge Buckwell's decision on 13 March 2013 the claimant  would  have
    had to remain in this country for at least another six  months,  before
    she had completed her course, it is not at all clear how he could  have
    found that she had sufficient funds available for this purpose.

13. It follows that the decision must be re-made by this Tribunal.

14. As already noted above, I went on to hear evidence  from  the  claimant
    herself, who told the Tribunal that currently there was �28,000 in  the
    bank account of her parents in the Philippines, which sum of money  was
    available to her.  The relevant  statements  were  currently  with  her
    lawyers, whom she had been expecting to attend at the hearing, but they
    had not arrived without any explanation.

15. With regard to her failure to provide sufficient evidence  with  regard
    to her finances, this was because she had made an  honest  mistake  and
    had believed that because she had an  "established  presence"  in  this
    country, she did not have to show more than  that  she  had  the  funds
    necessary for the three months after the date of the application.   She
    realised now that she had been wrong in  so  believing.   However,  the
    Tribunal should appreciate that the full tuition fees  of  �17,000  had
    been paid.  Half had been paid  in  September  of  last  year  and  the
    balance this January.  Had she known that she had  to  show  additional
    sums, she could have shown this at the time of making the  application.
    The funds were available, but were not shown in the bank accounts which
    were submitted.

16. With regard to the current course for which the fees had been  paid  in
    full, the claimant had nearly finished her studies.  She had to  submit
    her dissertation by 25 September this year (that is a little over three
    months away) and her degree (an MSc) would then be awarded in November.
     She confirmed that she would be able to submit  her  dissertation  and
    leave this country by the end of September this year.

17. As already noted above, Mr Wilding quite properly chose not to exercise
    his right to cross-examine the claimant.





Discussion

18. The only issue before me is whether, on the particular circumstances of
    this case, on the basis of the evidence which is  before  the  Tribunal
    now, this claimant should be allowed to remain, at least until the  end
    of September, pursuant to her Article 8 rights.  I of course ask myself
    the questions posited by  Lord  Bingham  in  Razgar,  and  conclude  as
    follows.  To require this claimant to leave the UK now, does amount  to
    an interference with her private life, such as to engage her Article  8
    rights.  This is because it is, in my judgment, an  important  part  of
    her private life now to be enabled to conclude the course for which she
    has been studying and for which a considerable sum of money has already
    been expended.  However,  such  interference  would  be  for  a  lawful
    purpose and would also be necessary for the  legitimate  and  important
    purpose of maintaining the economic wellbeing of this  country  through
    the  maintenance  of  an  effective,  fair  and  consistent  system  of
    immigration control.  The real issue in this case, as it so  often  is,
    is whether  in  the  particular  circumstances  that  exist  here,  the
    decision is proportionate for this purpose.

19. Having considered all the factors very carefully, I have concluded that
    in this particular case, the removal of this claimant now, when she  is
    so close to finishing her  studies,  would  not  be  proportionate.   I
    accept her evidence that there is currently  �28,000  in  her  parents'
    bank account, which is available to her and which sum is sufficient  to
    enable her to be maintained adequately until she  leaves  this  country
    (it being considerably more than would be required under the rules were
    she now obliged to show she had sufficient funds  for  her  maintenance
    until the end of September).  I also accept that she will in fact leave
    before the end of September this year, as she has said.  Providing  she
    does, there is no real detriment to this country  in  allowing  her  to
    stay for this relatively short period, so that the funds that  she  has
    expended so far are not wasted and she can complete her course.  On the
    particular facts of this case, I do not consider that a rigid adherence
    to the Rules is required for  the  legitimate  purpose  of  maintaining
    confidence in these Rules.

20. Accordingly, this claimant's appeal must succeed to the extent that she
    should be allowed to remain in this country lawfully until the  end  of
    September this year.  (There has in any event not  yet  been  a  lawful
    decision with regard to her removal, and it follows from my decision in
    this appeal that any decision to remove this claimant before the end of
    September this year would also be in breach of her Article  8  rights.)
    I should, however, make it clear that on the facts as I have found them
    to be, I consider that requiring this claimant to leave this country by
    the end of September this  year  would  be  proportionate  and  I  have
    accepted her assurance that she will leave before this date.







Decision

I set aside the determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Buckwell  as
containing a material error of law and substitute the following decision:

The claimant's appeal is allowed on human rights grounds, Article 8.
