                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION not made)

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Islam, Solicitor from Fountain Solicitors,
Birmingham
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

1.   The First-tier Tribunal made an anonymity direction under  Rule  13  of
    the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum
    Chamber) Rules 2014.  I see no proper reason for  the  making  of  that
    anonymity order and I discharge it.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Iraq born on 17 May 1998.  She claims  to
    have arrived in the United Kingdom clandestinely on 31  July  2018  and
    claimed asylum  on  the  same  day.   Her  claim  was  refused  by  the
    respondent on 14 December 2018 and the appellant appealed to the First-
    tier Tribunal.  Her appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Obhi
    in Birmingham on 27 March, 2019.

3.   Mr McVeety, with his customary sense of  fairness,  agreed  that  there
    were unsatisfactory findings in the determination which appeared to  be
    based on speculation and that  the  determination  could  not  properly
    stand.

4.   I set aside the determination  in  its  entirety  and  given  that  the
    appellant has been denied a fair hearing,  direct  that  it  should  be
    reheard by the First-tier Tribunal, by a judge  other  than  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Obhi.  A Kurdish Sorani interpreter will be required and
    two hours should be allowed for the hearing of the appeal.
