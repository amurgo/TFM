                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Alis ('the Judge'), sent to the parties on 16  December  2020,
    by which the appellant's appeal against a decision of the respondent to
    refuse his protection claim was refused.

 2. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Beach granted the appellant permission
    to appeal on all grounds.

Appellate history

 3. The appellant's appeal was previously considered by Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Lang by means of a decision dated 30 October  2019.  This
    decision was set aside by a decision of  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Chapman, dated 11 March  2020,  to  the  extent  that  the  appeal  was
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to determine in the  light  of  the
    country guidance in SMO, KSP & IM (Article 15(c);  identity  documents)
    Iraq CG [2019] UKUT 00400 (IAC):

         i) Whether the appellant can safely be returned to Kirkuk; and

        ii) If not, whether it would be reasonable and not unduly  harsh  to
            expect him to internally relocate.

 4. Judge Chapman confirmed the preservation of the  unchallenged  findings
    by Judge Lang that the appellant does not have a well-founded  fear  of
    persecution in Iraq and that he would be able to  obtain  his  original
    CSID or a replacement within a reasonable time frame.

Remote Hearing

 5. The hearing before me was a Skype for Business video conference hearing
    held during the Covid-19 pandemic. I was present in a hearing  room  at
    Field House. The hearing room and the building were open to the public.
    The hearing and its start time were listed in the  cause  list.  I  was
    addressed by the representatives in the  same  manner  as  if  we  were
    together in the hearing room. I am satisfied: that this  constituted  a
    hearing in open  court;  that  the  open  justice  principle  has  been
    secured; that no party has been prejudiced; and that, insofar as  there
    has been any restriction on a right or interest,  it  is  justified  as
    necessary and proportionate.

Anonymity

 6. The Judge made an anonymity order and no party before me requested that
    it be set aside.  I  confirm  the  order  at  the  conclusion  of  this
    decision.



Background

 7. The appellant is a national of Iraq and is presently aged 35. He  is  a
    Turkman who was born and resided in  Kirkuk.  Turkmen  are  a  minority
    ethnic group in Iraq who are of Turkic origin and who mostly adhere  to
    a Turkish heritage and identity.[1]The respondent's CPIN, 'Iraq:  Sunni
    Arabs', version  3  (January  2021),  references  at  para.  3.1.2  the
    Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) 'Iraq Country
    Information Report' (August  2020)  which  observed  that  Turkmen  are
    regarded primarily as an ethnic rather than religious group in Iraq.

 8. The appellant clandestinely arrived in the  United  Kingdom  in  August
    2015 and claimed asylum soon after his arrival. He asserted a  fear  of
    ISIS (also known as ISIL). By a witness statement dated 25 January 2016
    the appellant stated that he last saw his parents and siblings in  2014
    when his village was invaded by ISIS. He confirmed that he did not know
    what happened to them and they may have been killed. He explained  that
    two men whom he knew from the mosque stopped him and asked  whether  he
    would assist them. They  approached  him  three  times.  The  appellant
    believed that they worked with a terrorist group.  Upon  informing  his
    uncle as to the approaches, he was advised to leave the country.

 9. In his asylum interview  held  on  12  September  2018,  the  appellant
    confirmed that his siblings had been killed. He explained that  he  was
    working in a garage when a group of people approached him in July  2015
    to undertake some metalwork on their behalf. He was invited for  meals.
    He was subsequently informed that they wanted to convert some cars into
    armoured cars. He saw these men on three or four occasions. They  tried
    to recruit him. They advised him to keep the conversations  secret  and
    informed him that they would kill him and anyone  he  spoke  to  if  he
    discussed such matters. He informed his uncle who advised  him  not  to
    undertake the work. After his refusal, the men planted a bomb in  front
    of his uncle's house.

10. In his second witness statement, dated 11 October 2019,  the  appellant
    detailed, 'I believe that my mother and siblings were killed when  ISIS
    destroyed our village - I don't know this  for  certain  -  but  it  is
    something I strongly believe happened'.

11. The respondent refused the application for international protection  by
    a decision dated 5 September 2019. It was accepted that  the  appellant
    is an Iraqi national, ethnically Turkman and from Kirkuk. Consequent to
    several identified inconsistencies in the appellant's  stated  history,
    and the failure to raise relevant facts in his screening interview, the
    respondent did not accept the appellant's assertions as to his fear  of
    ISIS.

12. Judge Lang found, at  [31]  of  her  decision,  that  there  were  many
    inconsistencies in the appellant's account of the threats made to  him.
    She determined that the appellant would be able to obtain his  original
    CSID or a replacement within a reasonable timeframe, at [35].

Hearing before the FtT

13. The appeal came before the Judge sitting in Manchester  on  7  December
    2020. It was dismissed by a decision sent to the parties on 16 December
    2020.

14. The Judge observed amendments to the  appellant's  evidence,  at  [38]-
    [42]:

         '38. In adopting his statements before me the appellant  maintained
             the previous  account  but  now  claimed  (a)  he  claimed  his
             maternal uncle only had a copy of his CSID  whereas  previously
             he had claimed he had the original; (b) his uncle continued  to
             live in the same house and (c)  he  last  spoke  to  his  uncle
             around three months ago.

         39.  With regard to  the  CSID  card,  Mr.  Wood  [the  appellant's
             representative] invited me to accept the  appellant's  evidence
             and find the appellant had meant his  uncle  only  had  a  good
             quality copy of his CSID card.

         40.   Mr. Royle [the presenting officer] referred me  to  what  the
             appellant had said in his interview  and  second  statement.  I
             would also add Judge Lang recorded at paragraph [16] of his/her
             decision that the appellant believed his CSID card was probably
             still at his uncle's house. The appellant has not suggested the
             document was no longer with his uncle.

         41.   Until November 2020  the  appellant  had  always  stated  his
             maternal uncle had his original CSID card  and  whilst  I  have
             considered his attended explanation, I reject that explanation.
             The  appellant  has  used  the   same   legal   representatives
             throughout and a consistent theme throughout his evidence prior
             to November 2020 was his uncle had his original CSID.

         42.  Having considered all the evidence, I am  satisfied  that  the
             appellant's maternal uncle is in possession of the  appellant's
             original CSID card.  I  also  find  the  appellant  remains  in
             contact with him.'

15. The Judge concluded as to the appellant's ability to return to Iraq and
    travel to Kirkuk, at [47]:

         '47. As I have found the appellant has access to his original  CSID
             card I find he could be returned on a Laissez Passer  and  then
             he would be able to travel within Iraq on  his  CSID  card.  he
             would not need to obtain an INID card but even  if  he  did  he
             could use his original  CSID  to  obtain  such  a  document  in
             Kirkuk.'

16. In respect of the appellant's ethnicity, the Judge  observed  at  [48]-
    [50]

         '48.  The next issue is whether he can return  to  live  in  Kirkuk
             safely having regard to his ethnicity. Mr.  Wood  argued  that
             the appellant would by virtue of his father's associations  to
             the Ba'ath Party be perceived to have been involved with  ISIL
             and in opposition to the forces currently  controlling  Kirkuk
             and given the presence of Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU)  he
             would be at risk of harm as  a  result  of  belonging  to  the
             Turkmen ethnic group.

         49.    In SMO Dr Fatah confirmed  that  Kirkuk  was  an  ethnically
             diverse  area  with  Kurds,  Arabs,  Turkmen,  Christians  and
             Assyrians living there. The UNHCR May 2019 guidance underlined
             the importance of considering whether an individual  can  take
             up  residency  and  'durably  remain'  in   the   area   under
             consideration, particularly with reference to Sunni Arabs  and
             Sunni Turkmen. The Upper Tribunal accepted that the  situation
             in Iraq is incomparable to how it was in the period 2014-2017.
             However, a (massively depleted) threat from  ISIL,  and  other
             security challenges remain, and it was clear that the security
             agencies including the PMU were rigorous  about  checking  the
             identities of individuals who travel from one area to another.

         50.  The conclusion of the Upper Tribunal in SMO was that where  an
             individual had a connection with a  formally  contested  area,
             there was no reason why that person would be unable to  secure
             the necessary documentation to settle in such an  area.  Prior
             to coming to the United Kingdom, the appellant  had  lived  in
             Kirkuk without difficulties  save  for  the  threat  posed  by
             ISIL.'

17. As to the appellant's fear arising from his father's  involvement  with
    the Ba'ath Party, the Judge observed that he was required to  undertake
    a fact-sensitive, sliding scale assessment. He reminded himself at [51]
    that the impact  of  any  relevant  personal  characteristics  must  be
    carefully assessed against the situation in the area to which return is
    contemplated, with particular reference to the extent of  ongoing  ISIS
    activity and the behaviour of the security actors  in  control  of  the
    area. He noted that a relevant factor  is  membership  of  a  national,
    ethnic or religious group which is either in the minority in  the  area
    or not in de facto control of the area. The Judge concluded, at [52]:

         '52. His father died in 2004 and the appellant did not describe any
             other problems, other than the problems that led him to flee. I
             do not accept his father's  association  to  the  Ba'ath  Party
             would lead to the PMU perceiving him to be involved with  ISIL.
             He has a home to return to because he remains in  contact  with
             his maternal uncle who he told me continues to live in the same
             house. He has a support network in place  taking  into  account
             Judge Lang's previous unchallenged findings together with  what
             is known about the  appellant  I  am  not  satisfied  that  his
             ethnicity would place him at risk of serious harm.'

18. The Judge determined at [54]:

          '54. I therefore conclude that this appellant, on the facts of the
             case, could safely return  to  Iraq  specifically  to  live  in
             Kirkuk. His return will be via Baghdad on a Laissez Passer, but
             he would be able to travel safely on his CSID  card  to  Kirkuk
             without interference.'

Grounds of Appeal

19. The concise grounds of appeal raise two grounds of challenge:

         i) Inadequate reasons as to the  reasonableness  of  the  appellant
            returning to Kirkuk consequent to his father's involvement  with
            the Ba'ath Party.

        ii) Inadequate reasons as to the  reasonableness  of  the  appellant
            returning to Kirkuk as an ethnic Turkman.

20. In respect of [52] of the decision, detailed above, the grounds  assert
    at �5:

         '5.  It is respectfully submitted that Judge  Alis  has  failed  to
             provide any reasoning for his material findings of fact  above.
             The Appellant is unable to comprehend why his appeal  has  been
             refused. The absence of reasoning required by SMO must  vitiate
             Judge Alis'  overall  adverse  conclusion  on  the  Appellant's
             appeal. Had Judge Alis not materially erred  in  law  then  the
             First-tier Tribunal could have come to a  different  conclusion
             on the Appellant's appeal. The Appellant seeks  the  remedy  of
             having  Judge's  Alis'  decision  set  aside  and  his   appeal
             reheard.'

21. The grounds of appeal do not advance a  complaint  concerning  internal
    relocation. Such ground would only be considered if the appellant could
    succeed as to his present grounds of appeal, which are  concerned  with
    his case that his return to Kirkuk would breach his protected article 3
    rights and/or article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive.

22. Judge Beach gave reasons when granting permission to appeal:

         '3.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  considers  the  appellant's
             ethnicity and his claim that he would be at risk because of his
             father's previous involvement in the  Ba'ath  Party  [52].   He
             notes that the appellant did not previously face problems as  a
             result of his father's  claimed  involvement  with  the  Ba'ath
             Party. The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  refers  to  the  UNHCR
             evidence with regard to ethnicity and the need to ensure that a
             returnee could take up residence and  'durably  remain'.  [49].
             The First-tier Tribunal Judge gives some  reasons  for  finding
             that the appellants would not be at risk as  a  result  of  his
             ethnicity. However, it is arguable that he did not fully engage
             in the arguments before him with regard to ethnicity  and  that
             he did not give clear reasons as to why the appellant would not
             be at  present  risk  as  a  result  of  his  father's  claimed
             involvement in the Ba'ath Party (notwithstanding  that  he  did
             not face problems in the past).

Decision on Error of Law

Ground 1

23. In his witness statement, dated 11 October 2019, the  appellant  stated
    in simple terms that his father used to work in local government during
    the time of Saddam Hussein, at �5; that  as  his  father  worked  under
    Saddam Hussein such fact would cause him problems in Kurdistan, at �29;
    and that as his father was 'in the Ba'ath Party' he could not  live  in
    Kurdistan, at �42.

24. Before Judge Lang the appellant detailed his belief that  people  would
    be able to tell from his name that he was his father's son and that his
    father had harassed people. He accepted that  he  had  not  experienced
    problems when living in Iraq in respect of his father but  stated  that
    this was because he had resided in  a  small  village  outside  Kirkuk,
    residing mainly amongst Shi'a and Turkmen. He is a Sunni  and  informed
    Judge Lang that he had never experienced problems  living  in  a  Shi'a
    dominated area. He believes  this  was  because  most  people  did  not
    realise that he is Sunni.

25. The Judge addresses this issue concisely at [52], simply observing that
    the appellant's father died in 2004 and the appellant had not  detailed
    any problems  arising  in  relation  to  his  father's  previous  local
    involvement with the Ba'ath Party. Upon  careful  consideration,  I  am
    satisfied that the judge failed to give adequate reasons as to why  the
    appellant  would  not  be  at  present  risk  consequent   to   present
    circumstances.  Such approach is erroneous in law.

26. However, I  am  satisfied  that  such  failure  is  not  material  upon
    consideration of the facts and  issues  arising  in  this  matter.  The
    appellant accepts that he suffered no difficulties  consequent  to  his
    father's political history whilst residing in Iraq up and until leaving
    the country in 2015.

27. Before me,  Mr.  Wood  relied  upon  paras.  2.4.5  and  4.1.3  of  the
    respondent's CPIN, 'Iraq: Baathists' version 2  (January  2020).  Para.
    2.4.5 is concerned with societal treatment:

         '2.4.5 In general, former Baath Party members are not  at  risk  of
              harm by societal actors. Although Shia militia have sometimes
              targeted  some  alleged  or  actual  former  Baathists,  such
              targeting is not systematic  and  is  often  dependent  on  a
              person's past profile and activities within the  Baath  party
              (see Treatment of Baathists and  Risk  profiles).  Whether  a
              person faces treatment amounting to persecution  will  depend
              on their former or current profile and  activities,  and  the
              capabilities and motivation of the non-state actors who  they
              fear. Each case will need to be considered on its facts, with
              the onus on the person to demonstrate that they are  at  risk
              of persecution.'

28. Para. 4.1.3 is concerned with the link between Baathists and ISIS:

         '4.1.3 The June 2019 EASO report stated:

              'Even though not all former Baathists were enthusiastic about
              ISIL, the remnants of the party  generally  shared  relations
              with the Islamic State. There has been  a  close  cooperation
              between the remnants of the former Baath Party and  ISIL  not
              least because of the shared hatred of the Shia-led government
              in Iraq. Saddam-era Baathist  military  and  police  officers
              were recruited by ISIL. It  was  also  reported  that  former
              Saddam-regime officers ran  three  of  the  most  crucial  of
              ISIL's 23 portfolios: security,  military  and  finance.  The
              list of the most  wanted  ISIL  members  published  by  Iraqi
              authorities in February 2018 contained  several  high-ranking
              former Baath party members.

              'On the one hand, ISIL recruited former  Saddam-era  Baathist
              military and police officers who have been a powerful  factor
              in the rise of ISIL and were instrumental in the survival  of
              its self-proclaimed caliphate.  On  the  other  hand,  former
              Baathists had their own political  goals  in  mind  and  were
              aiming for the  establishment  of  a  Sunni-dominated  tribal
              nation from Damascus to  Fallujah  to  Mosul,  thus  covertly
              undermining ISIL's caliphate.

              'The former Baathists were not able to compete with ISIL.  In
              fact, many former Baathists were arrested and killed by  ISIL
              due to rivalry. To  tame  any  opposition,  ISIL  arrested  a
              number of local Baath party  leaders  and  members  in  2014,
              suggesting fractures in  the  local  Baathist-ISIL  alliance.
              Former Baathists and  their  properties,  particularly  those
              belonging to former officers of the Iraqi Army  under  Saddam
              Hussein,  were  also  targeted  in  the  military  operations
              against ISIL by the progovernment forces,  including  militia
              groups.'

29. The sole expressed fear identified by the appellant as to his link with
    his father being recognised is through his name. No  detailed  evidence
    is given as to how such identification would be made in  respect  of  a
    man who died some 17 years ago. It is not  said  that  the  appellant's
    name is unusual. It is not said  that  his  father  held  a  medium  or
    significant role within the local or national party.  It  is  not  said
    that the appellant's  father  worked  either  for  the  police  or  the
    security/intelligence regime. The appellant's father was  one  of  many
    who worked in local government during the time of the Ba'athist regime,
    which came to an end in 2003. The appellant's reference to  his  father
    harassing  people  is  outlined  in  very  general   terms,   with   no
    identification as to the substance and nature of such  harassment.  The
    paragraphs of SMO relied upon by Mr. Wood do  not  aid  the  appellant.
    They do not identify a risk to children of Ba'athist party members  who
    themselves had no connection with the party. The very limited  evidence
    presently relied upon by the appellant  comes  nowhere  near  close  to
    establishing to the  requisite  standard  that  his  return  to  Kirkuk
    consequent his father's connection to the Ba'ath Party over two decades
    ago would result in a breach  of  article  15(c)  or  breach  protected
    article 3 rights. This ground of appeal is dismissed.

Ground 2

30. The complaint made is that the  Judge  did  not  fully  engage  in  the
    submissions advanced by the appellant in respect of his ethnicity.  Mr.
    Wood succinctly addressed me on this  point,  relying  upon  [251]  and
    [256] of the country guidance decision in SMO:

         '251. All of Kirkuk governorate is disputed between the GOI and the
             IKR.  It is an ethnically diverse governorate which has seen a
             great deal of upheaval in recent decades. We were struck by Dr
             Fatah's evidence that an individual who had  lived  in  Kirkuk
             since the 1970's would  have  seen  it  change  hands  several
             times. Kirkuk City itself was never  taken  by  ISIL  although
             Hawija was, and Hawija was one of the last places in  Iraq  to
             be liberated, in October 2017. The battle  for  Hawija  caused
             significant damage to its infrastructure. Since  control  over
             Kirkuk was taken back from the peshmerga in the  aftermath  of
             the Kurdish Independence Referendum, the whole governorate  is
             controlled by the ISF, with  a  significant  presence  of  PMU
             militia.'

         ...

         '256. There is  a  security  vacuum  in  the  rural  parts  of  the
             governorate, left by the departure of the  peshmerga  in  late
             2017. ISIL has some support in the region and has been able to
             move freely and expand its  operations  in  the  region  as  a
             result of that vacuum.  It is regarded  as  one  of  the  core
             areas for ISIL's rebuilding efforts by  Joel  Wing  and  other
             respected contributors. We also accept the evidence  given  by
             Dr Fatah about the effect of the PMU  in  Kirkuk  governorate.
             Whilst they lessen the threat from ISIL in  the  region,  they
             have also brought renewed sectarian tension, for  instance  by
             renaming Sunni sites with Shia names.  The  fact  that  Kirkuk
             remains  a  Disputed  Territory  also   contributes   to   the
             uncertainty experienced by residents of the Governorate.'

31. The Tribunal observed  in  SMO  that  the  situation  in  the  Formerly
    Contested Area of Kirkuk is complex, encompassing ethnic, political and
    humanitarian issues which differ by  region.  The  Judge  observed  and
    applied the Tribunal's guidance that consideration as  to  whether  the
    return of an individual to such an area would be  contrary  to  article
    15(c) requires a fact-sensitive, 'sliding scale' assessment. A relevant
    question in respect of this  appellant  when  undertaking  the  sliding
    scale assessment is his  membership  of  an  ethnic  group  that  is  a
    minority Kirkuk and that he is a Sunni Muslim, such group not being  in
    de facto control of the area surrounding Kirkuk.

32. I observe that appellant placed very limited objective evidence  before
    the Judge in respect of the  position  of  Turkmen  in  Kirkuk,  beyond
    reliance  upon  SMO  and  CPINs.  I  observe  four  newspaper  articles
    concerned with explosions in Kirkuk. One is dated 8 September 2018  and
    the other three are concerned with a series of explosions in  late  May
    2019. The September  2018  article  was  authored  by  Al  Arabiya  and
    identifies that there was no immediate claim of responsibility for  the
    bombing, though reference is made to ISIS mounting hit and run  attacks
    in respect of the government. The May 2019 articles  all  observe  that
    there were no claims of responsibility in respect  of  the  explosions.
    Reference is again made to the use of hit  and  run  attacks  by  ISIS.
    These newspaper articles are not evidence as to Turkmen being  targeted
    by armed groups in Kirkuk consequent to their ethnicity.

33. Whilst the Judge's consideration as to the  appellant's  ethnicity  was
    concise, I am satisfied that it was lawful. Evidence before  the  Judge
    as to the  actions  of  the  PMU  was  extremely  limited.  Whilst  the
    appellant's  legal  representatives  have  written  to  this   Tribunal
    indicating that they are in the process of seeking expert evidence from
    Dr Fatah, and this was confirmed to me by Mr. Wood, such  evidence  was
    not before the Judge. In the circumstances, I  am  satisfied  that  the
    Judge had no cogent evidence before him to conclude that the PMU act in
    such sectarian manner to permit the  appellant  to  rely  upon  article
    15(c) in respect of his return to Kirkuk, or to permit the appellant to
    succeed on  article  3  grounds.   The  evidence  relied  upon  by  the
    appellant was predominantly directed towards a  purported  threat  from
    ISIS if he returned  to  Kirkuk,  not  to  his  suffering  significant,
    adverse  sectarian  discrimination  upon  return  consequent   to   his
    ethnicity. The Tribunal is a specialist one and is aware  that  Turkmen
    political parties are active in Kirkuk, e.g., the Iraqi Turkmen  Front.
    The predominant religious group in the governorate of Kirkuk are  Sunni
    Muslims and whilst the Shi'a PMU  is  active,  it  is  one  of  several
    security actors operating in Kirkuk governorate,  including  the  Iraqi
    army, the Counter-Terrorism Service,  federal  and  local  police,  and
    various intelligence services.

34. The Judge was mindful of the Tribunal's consideration of evidence  from
    various experts and the UNHCR in SMO.

35. In the  absence  of  relevant  objective  evidence  supportive  of  the
    appellant's contention as  to  risks  flowing  from  his  ethnicity  if
    returned to Kirkuk and noting Judge Lang's uncontested finding that the
    appellant has a support network available to him upon his return to the
    city, the Judge could  reasonably  reach  his  conclusion  that  having
    placed  relevant  evidence  into  a  sliding   scale   assessment   the
    appellant's ethnicity was not such as  to  require  him  to  allow  the
    appeal. This ground of appeal must therefore be dismissed.

[1] The last reliable Iraqi census permitting minorities to register was in
1957. Whilst there is no accurate record as to the number of Turkmen
residing in Iraq, reputable estimates range from 10 to 13% of the
population (3 to 3� million), with the majority residing in northern and
central regions of the country.
