For the Appellant:     Mr M Sihwa, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Peru, born on 28 June 1986.  She  is  the
    spouse of Christian Alfonso Tinico Apolo, a citizen  of  Ecuador,  with
    whom she began a relationship over the internet leading to a meeting in
    person on 26 February 2010 and a marriage on 1 February 2011  in  Peru.
    Mr Apolo was granted indefinite leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom
    on 26 August 2009 and the appellant  applied  for  and  was  granted  a
    spouse visa on the basis of her marriage from  8  December  2011  to  8
    March 2014.  She came to the United Kingdom on 9 December 2011 to  live
    with her husband.

2.   On 7 March 2014 the appellant applied for further leave  to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom but that application was refused for reasons set out
    in a letter dated 29 April 2014.  The principal reason was that she did
    not meet the English language requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    She provided  two  IELTS  certificates  with  her  application  showing
    speaking scores of 3 and 3.5 which were below the 4  required  to  meet
    the minimum  A1  level  threshold.   The  Reasons  for  Refusal  Letter
    indicated that her family and  private  life  was  considered  but  the
    Secretary of State was not satisfied that she  was  able  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules. Nor was she satisfied that  her  application
    raised or contained any exceptional circumstances which  might  warrant
    consideration of a grant of leave  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
    outside the requirements of the Rules. That decision was the subject of
    an appeal which was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Monaghan  on  15
    January 2015 and which was refused in a determination promulgated on 28
    January 2015.  An appeal  was  then  taken  against  that  decision  on
    various  grounds  including  an  alleged  failure  to  apply   Pankina,
    Chikwamba, Veerabudren and Article 8 ECHR.  Permission was only granted
    on the basis that it was arguable that the judge failed  to  adopt  the
    five stage Razgar test and that she was incorrect in stating  that  the
    appellant had no family in  the  United  Kingdom  as  her  partner  was
    settled here. The latter point was not argued before us and we have  no
    difficulty in finding that it has no merit. The context  in  which  the
    reference was made showed plainly that the judge was referring  to  the
    appellant's blood relatives and it is a  fact  that  none  of  them  is
    present in the United Kingdom.

3.   The judge in the FtT set out the background to the case  then  the  law
    and the evidence given by the appellant and her husband.  We  need  not
    repeat  that  verbatim.   She  also  referred  to  evidence  from   the
    appellant's sister-in-law and a family friend.  Thereafter she set  out
    the submissions of the parties before making her findings.  It was  not
    disputed that the speaking score was below the 4 required to  meet  the
    minimum A1 level threshold although she found that  the  appellant  had
    now attained the necessary standard.  That did not avail her since  she
    had not met the requirements at the material time.

4.   From paragraph 35 onwards the judge set out her  consideration  of  the
    appellant's family life under Article 8,  which  she  said  fell  under
    Appendix FM EX.1 of the Rules from 9 July 2012.  The relevant  findings
    are in paragraph 37, which is in the following terms:-

         "It is not in doubt that the appellant has a genuine and subsisting
         relationship with her partner who is settled in the UK. She married
         him in Peru in 2011.  She came to the United Kingdom on 9  December
         2011 and they have lived together at various addresses  since  that
         time.  Evidence was given by her friend and sister-in-law about the
         nature of their relationship which confirmed the position.

         It  is  not  accepted,  however,  that  there  are   insurmountable
         obstacles to the appellant and her husband continuing  family  life
         in Peru.  This is because the appellant has spent the  majority  of
         her life in Peru. She has only been in the  United  Kingdom  for  a
         little over three years. She is in regular contact with her  mother
         in Peru and sends her money each month to assist with her  support.
         She does not have any family in the United Kingdom.  She has worked
         in Peru in child caring jobs and on her own  evidence  this  is  an
         area that she would like to work in again in the future.  There  is
         no reason why she cannot study and or work in Peru to  further  her
         wishes to be employed in child care. Similarly although her husband
         has been settled in the United Kingdom for thirteen years  and  has
         held employment in catering, there is no reason why  he  could  not
         find such work and further study in caring in Peru  or  in  another
         suitable employment.  It is accepted that the  appellant  has  also
         developed a relationship with her husband's  family.  However  both
         the appellant and her husband could keep in touch with  his  family
         by social media, email and telephone and by family visits.

         The appellant has had some health problems in relation  to  ovarian
         cysts. She has no other health problems. She could receive  medical
         treatment in Peru for these  problems.   Her  husband  is  in  good
         health.

         Insurmountable obstacles means very significant difficulties  which
         would be faced by the appellant or her partner and which could  not
         be overcome or would entail very serious hardships.  On  the  facts
         found there was no  evidence  to  support  the  existence  of  such
         obstacles in this case."

5.   At paragraph 39 the judge said that there  was  nothing  compelling  or
    exceptional in the  case  that  required  consideration  of  Article  8
    outside the Rules.  There were no arguably good  grounds  beyond  those
    already considered within the Rules.

6.   In presenting the appeal before us Mr Sihwa commenced  his  submissions
    by arguing that the appellant did in fact meet the requirements of  the
    test at the material time but we refused to allow him to  develop  this
    argument since no permission had been granted for it  to  be  advanced.
    He then turned to the submissions on Article 8.

7.   He  submitted  that  the  reasoning  of  the  Secretary  of  State  was
    defective because she had not considered the position  of  the  spouse,
    who had indefinite leave to remain.   He had been in the UK since  2002
    and would have to give up his employment if he had to go to  Peru.   He
    also had family members in this country.  There was no reason he should
    go to a country of which he was not a national.  The appellant  had  an
    ovarian cyst and required medical attention.  Her spouse's evidence was
    that he could not give up his work and there would be no  accommodation
    and no family in Peru to assist  them.   He  could  not  pay  for  such
    medication as she would require  in Peru.  None of this was dealt  with
    in the Reasons for Refusal Letter.  The Secretary of State  had  simply
    indulged in a tick box exercise, as deprecated in Nagre.  There was  no
    reasoning behind the suggestion  in  the  letter  that  there  were  no
    exceptional circumstances to justify  a  grant  of  leave  outside  the
    Rules.  The appellant's leave to remain here was not precarious and she
    was not an overstayer.    The  hardship   the  family  would  face  was
    exacerbated by the new Rules.  Her spouse would now have  to  meet  the
    requirements to show an income of �18,600.  His income had gone down to
    �1,200 per month.  The appellant had no previous  convictions  and  her
    conduct, character and associations did not demand that she be removed.
      She  now  met   all   the   requirements   and   the   decision   was
    disproportionate.  If she went  back  to  Peru  the  parties  would  be
    separated for an indefinite time.

8.   In reply Mr Nath pointed out that the submissions were directed at  the
    Reasons for Refusal Letter rather than the determination and  that  our
    task was to see if there was an error of law in the latter.  He pointed
    to the assessment of Article 8 to   which  we  have  already  referred.
    Judge Monaghan had referred to the position of the spouse and  properly
    assessed it.  She set out that the appellant had no family  in  the  UK
    and had worked in Peru in child caring jobs.  On her own evidence  that
    was an area in which she would like to work again in the  future.   She
    was in regular contact with her mother in Peru. She also considered the
    position of the spouse. She noted that  he  had  been  settled  in  the
    United Kingdom for thirteen years,  that  he  had  held  employment  in
    catering and that there was no reason why he could not find  such  work
    and  further  study  in  catering  in  Peru  or  in  another   suitable
    employment. She found that he did have close family links in the United
    Kingdom, as Mr Sihwa had  submitted,  and  it  was  accepted  that  the
    appellant had developed a relationship with his family  but  she  found
    that both of them could keep in touch with the family by social  media,
    email,  telephone  and  family  visits.   She  also  dealt   with   the
    appellant's health.  There was no evidence before her that there was no
    health facility in Peru.  In short, there was no reason  to  find  that
    the assessment had not been  carried out correctly.

9.   Mr Sihwa had indicated that the  spouse's  family  included  a  mother,
    sister and nephew who lived in the United  Kingdom  and  had  suggested
    that the judge had not properly taken that into account. He went on  in
    further submissions, under reference to EB (Kosovo), to  say  that  the
    failure to take account of the position of the 8 month old nephew was a
    breach of Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
    2009 and the principles set out in ZH (Tanzania) which should have been
     taken account of in the Article 8 assessment.  Nothing was said as  to
    why it was proportionate in relation to the child for the spouse to  be
    required to leave the country.

10.  Furthermore, the Chikwamba point was not  addressed  by  her.   It  was
    relevant at that time.

11.   The  Secretary  of  State  said  that  there   were   no   exceptional
    circumstances but under the  authority  of  Veerabudren  that  was  not
    sufficient.   The  judge  simply  followed  the  Secretary  of  State's
    reasoning.  The medical treatment required by  the  appellant  was  not
    affordable so that made the case exceptional.   The  spouse  had  given
    evidence that he could not afford it, as was set out at paragraph 23 of
    the determination. There was no reasoning in the judge's  finding  that
    there was no reason why he could not find the work.  There were letters
    showing that she required future appointments (which referred  to  HRT)
    and they indicated that further treatment might  be  envisaged  in  the
    future. The judge could not have come to the conclusion which  she  did
    on the evidence before her.

Conclusions

12.  The only issue before us is whether it can be said that  the  judge  in
    the FTT failed properly to consider Article 8.  She took the view  that
    there  was   nothing   compelling   or   exceptional   which   required
    consideration outside the Rules but it appears to us that in  paragraph
    37 she did in fact consider all the various matters which  Mr  S  Sihwa
    desiderated.

13.  She was satisfied that the appellant had  spent  the  majority  of  her
    life in Peru, as was undoubtedly the case, and had family there.    She
    was satisfied that her spouse could  find work  in  Peru,  despite  his
    evidence to the contrary, which she obviously did not accept.  His lack
    of ability to afford medical  treatment  appears  to  have  been  based
    solely on his claimed inability to find work and in any event the judge
    found that the appellant herself could work in Peru.   No  other  basis
    was suggested as  to  why   the  appellant  could  not  access  medical
    treatment and the judge was entitled  to  find  that  the  question  of
    treatment did not weigh heavily in her favour.

14.  Chikwamba is  not  relevant  to  this  case.   The  circumstances  were
    different and in any event this is not a case where it can be said that
    the appellant meets the Rules as they now are in view of  her  spouse's
    financial position.  There is therefore more to this case  than  simply
    filling in a form with an inevitable outcome.

15.  It does not appear that the question of Section  55  or  ZH  (Tanzania)
    was raised specifically in the grounds  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and it was not raised specifically in the  grounds  of  appeal
    before us, except insofar as it can be said to arise in any case  where
    Article 8 is raised as an issue.  However, even if these matters should
    have been taken into account, we do not think that any  error  in  that
    regard, if there is one, is material.  In the  first  place  the  judge
    deals with the  position of the family members in the determination  at
    paragraphs 20 and 37.  In the second place, the child is only 8  months
    old and lives with his own family.  There is no reason why  the  spouse
    has to leave the country but even if he did, the effect on the  child's
    welfare and development is likely to be minimal. A further  application
    could be made from abroad once the parties meet the requirements of the
    Rules and there is nothing disproportionate in the Secretary  of  State
    insisting on that.
