                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    For the sake of continuity, I  refer  to  the  parties  as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal although technically  the  Secretary  of
    State is the appellant in the appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

2.    The appellant appealed the respondent's decision  to  refuse  a  human
    rights claim in the context of an application for leave  to  remain  as
    the  partner  of  a  British  citizen.  The  respondent   refused   the
    application on grounds of 'Suitability' because it  was  said  that  he
    obtained an English language  certificate  in  support  of  an  earlier
    application using fraud.  The  respondent  stated:  "following  routine
    investigation checks it has been found that the TOEIC certificate  used
    for the consideration of your previous two  Tier  4  applications  have
    been found as Invalid. Therefore, this document has been  shown  to  be
    fraudulent and, despite  this  being  the  case,  was  used  to  obtain
    previous leave."

3.    The respondent produced a print out of the 'Look-up  Tool'  confirming
    the information received from Educational Testing Services  (ETS).  ETS
    cancelled the English language test taken at Synergy  Business  College
    on 20 March 2012 as 'Invalid'. The respondent also  produced  a  report
    from Project Faï¿½ade (a criminal inquiry into TOEIC fraud)  relating  to
    Synergy Business College. The report stated that  between  24  November
    2011 and 15 January 2013 Synergy Business College undertook 4,894 TOEIC
    speaking and writing tests of which ETS identified 2,410  as  'Invalid'
    and 2,484 as 'Questionable'. The figures showed that 49% of tests  were
    deemed 'Invalid', but the rest of the tests taken  during  that  period
    were   deemed   to   be   'Questionable'   due    to    'administrative
    irregularities'. In other words, none of the tests  taken  during  that
    period were found to valid. The respondent also produced a print out of
    information relating to tests taken at Synergy Business College  on  20
    March 2012 (the date the  appellant  took  the  test).  The  print  out
    indicated that 134 tests were taken that day of  which  47  (35%)  were
    deemed 'Questionable' and 87 (65%)  were  deemed  'Invalid'.  In  other
    words, none of the tests taken that day were found to be  valid  and  a
    high  proportion  were  found  to  indicate  evidence  of  fraud.   The
    respondent produced the generic  statements  of  Peter  Millington  and
    Rebecca Collings, which were analysed  in  some  detail  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal in SM & Qadir (ETS - evidence - burden of proof)  [2016]  UKUT
    229 and an  expert  report  by  Professor  Peter  French  dealing  with
    technical issues relating to the likelihood of false positive reporting
    of fraud in the ETS investigation process.

4.    First-tier Tribunal Judge S. Taylor ("the judge") allowed  the  appeal
    in a decision promulgated on 15 December 2016. His findings relating to
    the 'Suitability' criteria and the allegation of deception are at [12]:

            "The appellant applied for leave  to  remain  in  the  UK  as  a
           spouse, the refusal has been on  the  sole  ground  that  it  is
           alleged  that  he  used  fraudulent  means  to  obtain  a  TOEIC
           certificate in respect of  his  English  language  ability.  The
           particular certificate which is in dispute dates  back  to  2012
           and the respondent relies on evidence  submitted  by  ETS  which
           lists the appellant among several students at the  centre  whose
           results were found to be invalid. There  is  no  other  specific
           evidence relating to the appellant, other than  his  appears  on
           the list of invalid results. The appellant denies the allegation
           and states  that  he  genuinely  attended  the  examination  and
           passed. He gave a detailed statement and provided oral  evidence
           which was consistent with his statement, which was not shaken by
           cross examination. It was submitted on behalf of the  respondent
           that the appellant was unable to show proficiency in English  at
           the hearing and had to rely at times  on  the  services  of  the
           interpreter, several questions had to be  put  in  English  more
           than once. However, I note the comments in SM and Qadir that the
           Tribunal did not have expertise in measuring English ability and
           could only take a subjective view. If the appellant  was  unable
           to speak English at all that would be very clear. However  there
           is no dispute that the appellant passed an English language test
           at level A2 in 2010, some two years prior to the disputed  test,
           and he had passed an examination at level A1 in 2015.  While  it
           was pointed out that A1 was at a lower level than  the  disputed
           test at B2, it was noted that the A1 test was in respect of  the
           marriage application and that was the required level.  There  is
           also no dispute that prior to the  disputed  test  in  2012  the
           appellant successfully completed a level 5  course  in  business
           management.  I  therefore   find,   that   notwithstanding   the
           appellant's apparent poor English at the hearing, he has  passed
           two undisputed qualifications prior to the disputed test, one at
           A2 and a level 5 course, and he has since passed a qualification
           at A1, which was all that was required at the  time.  While  the
           ETS evidence casts doubt on the result of  the  B2  examination,
           the appellant gave consistent evidence that  he  genuinely  took
           the test, and this is consistent with  his  other  test  passes,
           both before and since 2012. The sponsor stated in  her  evidence
           that the appellant was a simple individual and this may in  some
           way explain his presentation at the  hearing.  On  the  required
           standard of proof I am satisfied that  the  appellant  took  the
           test in 2012 and the certificate was not fraudulent."

5.    The respondent appeals the decision on the ground that the  First-tier
    Tribunal  failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  to   explain   why   the
    respondent's evidence did not discharge the legal burden of proof.

6.    I have considered the grounds of appeal and the oral  submissions,  as
    well as the documentary evidence, before coming to a decision.

Decision and reasons

7.    The  judge  heard  evidence  from  the  appellant  regarding  the  ETS
    allegation and could assess him as a witness. It was open to the  judge
    to take into account  the  fact  that  the  appellant  had  provided  a
    detailed witness statement and  that  his  account  was  consistent  in
    evidence at the hearing. It is also clear that the judge was  aware  of
    the decision in SM & Qadir in which the Upper Tribunal considered  what
    weight could  be  placed  on  the  generic  evidence  provided  by  the
    Secretary of State.

8.    However, the evidence produced in this case was not  confined  to  the
    'Look-up tool' print out  and  the  generic  statements.  The  evidence
    produced by  the  respondent  included  specific  reports  relating  to
    Synergy Business College including figures relating to  the  number  of
    tests cancelled over a period of time and information relating  to  the
    tests taken on the day the appellant says that he took  the  test.  The
    reports appeared to show that  none  of  the  tests  taken  at  Synergy
    Business College over a 14-month period were deemed valid  by  ETS  and
    that none of the tests taken on 20 March 2012 were  deemed  valid.  The
    reports showed that 65% of tests taken on 20  March  2012  were  deemed
    'Invalid' due to evidence of fraud. This evidence was  not  generic  or
    marginal. It indicated that there was likely to  be  a  high  level  of
    fraud at the test centre where the appellant says he took the test.

9.    The judge was right to say that there was little direct evidence  from
    ETS to show individual fraud, but the evidence relating to the level of
    likely fraud at Synergy Business College was sufficiently  material  to
    require some analysis and reasoning. The statement that  the  appellant
    was "among several students at the centre whose results were  found  to
    be invalid" was not supported by the evidence. He  was  among  a  large
    majority of students at Synergy Business  College  whose  results  were
    found to be 'Invalid' on 20 March 2012. In assessing the credibility of
    the appellant's oral evidence, it was necessary for the judge  to  take
    into account the evidence produced by the respondent  relating  to  the
    level of potential fraud at Synergy Business College. The judge  failed
    to make any findings as to what weight should be placed on the evidence
    and failed to give sufficient reasons to explain why  the  respondent's
    evidence did not discharge the legal burden of proof.  Had the evidence
    relating to Synergy Business College not disclosed such a high level of
    potential fraud the error might not have been material, but  given  the
    relevance of those figures to the credibility of the  appellant's  oral
    evidence, the failure to give  adequate  reasons  to  explain  why  the
    respondent's evidence did not undermine the appellant's oral  evidence,
    amounts to an error of law.

10.   A further error was identified at the hearing, which was  accepted  by
    the  appellant's  representative.  The  appellant   made   an   in-time
    application for a variation of leave to remain from a Tier 4 Migrant to
    a partner under Appendix FM. Even  if  the  judge  had  given  adequate
    reasons to explain his findings relating to the 'Suitability' criteria,
    the  consequence  would  be  that  the   appellant   would   meet   the
    'Eligibility' and 'Immigration Status' requirements. It would  then  be
    necessary  to  consider  whether  the  appellant  met  the  'Financial'
    requirements of Appendix FM. It would only be if he did not meet  those
    requirements that it might be relevant to go on to  consider  paragraph
    EX.1. The First-tier Tribunal failed to consider whether the  appellant
    met the 'Financial' requirements. The  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  who
    rehears the appeal may want to bear this point in mind.

11.   The First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of  an  error  of
    law. The decision is set aside and the appeal is remitted to the First-
    tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.
