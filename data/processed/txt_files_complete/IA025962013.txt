Representation:

For the Appellant:     In Person
For the Respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant, a national of Pakistan who was born on 30th March  1987,
    has appealed to the Upper Tribunal in respect of a determination of the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Fisher),  promulgated  on  8th  April  2013,
    dismissing his appeal against the Respondent's decision of 7th  January
    2013 refusing to vary leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrant and deciding to remove him from the UK pursuant to  section  47
    of the Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. Anonymity was not sought and there does not appear to be any reason  to
    make such a direction. Judge Fisher did not make such a direction. I do
    not do so.

 3. The Respondent had refused the application  on  the  grounds  that  the
    Appellant had failed to show that he met various requirements contained
    in Appendix A and Appendix C of the Immigration Rules.

 4. As to Appendix A, the Judge concluded that mandatory requirements  were
    not met in that letters written by the NIB bank which had been tendered
    to show the availability  of  business  funding  were  not  dated;  the
    letters did not contain the  Appellant's  name;  they  post  dated  the
    application and a declaration produced by a third party did not contain
    the Appellant's signature. As to Appendix C, the Judge  concluded  that
    the credit balance in a bank statement submitted by the Appellant  with
    respect to the maintenance requirements  was  ï¿½57  below  the  required
    amount on one day during the assessment period.

 5. The Judge considered the possible impact of the decision  in  Rodriguez
    (Flexibility Policy) 2013 UKUT 42 (IAC) and concluded if  he  had  been
    concerned with Appendix C only he would have been minded to  allow  the
    appeal on the  basis  that  under  the  evidential  flexibility  policy
    addressed  in  Rodriguez  the  Respondent  could  have  contacted   the
    Appellant to see if he could "plug the gap" and it  appeared  he  could
    have done so by  providing  a  statement  from  a  different  financial
    institution. However, Rodriguez and the policy would  not  assist  with
    respect to Appendix A because "the evidential  flexibility  policy  was
    not intended to cater for those situations where the documents produced
    by an applicant simply did not meet the requirements of the Rules".

 6. In light of the above the Judge dismissed the appeal, with  respect  to
    variation of leave, under the Rules. He did,  though,  allow  it  to  a
    limited extent with respect to the removal aspect of the  decision,  on
    the basis that it is was, at the time, unlawful to take a variation and
    section 47 removal decision together. As to article 8 of the  ECHR  the
    Judge said this could  not  be  relied  upon  now  that  there  was  no
    immediate  risk  of  removal  and  noted  that  the  Appellant's   then
    representative accepted that to be the case.

 7. Although he  was  represented  before  Judge  Fisher,  it  appears  the
    Appellant, who is no longer represented, has  drafted  the  application
    for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal himself.  He  refers  to
    the evidential flexibility policy and appears to suggest  consideration
    should have been given to post application evidence.

 8. On 16th May 2013 Judge Pedro granted  permission  to  appeal.  This  is
    because it was thought Judge  Fisher  may  have  erred  in  failing  to
    consider post application evidence in light of the decision  in  Khatel
    2013 UKUT 00044 (IAC).

 9. In light of the grant,  the  Respondent  filed  a  "rule  24  response"
    contending that the  Judge  had  directed  himself  properly  save  for
    concluding that article 8 could not apply absent the threat of removal.
    However, it was contended this was not a  material  error  because  any
    article 8 arguments were bound to fail.

10. Before me the Appellant said that some documents which he had sought to
    rely upon with his application for variation had been lost in the post.
    He had to ask for them to be sent to him again. He  wants  to  start  a
    business.

11. Mrs Petersen submitted that the Judge's reasoning had been sound as  to
    both variation and removal. As to article 8 no points appeared to  have
    been taken in the grounds of appeal to the First-tier.

12. The Respondent has what is referred to  as  an  evidential  flexibility
    policy. A copy of the policy in the form it was in when the decision in
    Rodriguez was made is attached to the case report. Mrs  Petersen  tells
    me it had not changed substantially by the date of  the  decision  upon
    the Appellant's application. It is clear the policy is designed to deal
    with instances where evidence missing  from  an  application  might  be
    obtained so as to plug a gap, to borrow from the  way  in  which  Judge
    Fisher puts it. I am satisfied, though, that Judge  Fisher  is  correct
    when he says, in paragraph 10 and  11  of  the  determination,  that  a
    number of mandatory requirements were not met with respect to  Appendix
    A, as noted above, and that these do not fall within the scope  of  the
    policy. I note the partial explanation that some documents reached  the
    Appellant late but that does not assist him because it  does  not  deal
    with all the problems identified by the Respondent and  the  Judge  and
    does not, in any event, impact  upon  the  requirement  that  mandatory
    evidence is required with the application.

13. As to the Khatel point this is a reference to the Tribunal's  view,  as
    encompassed in that decision, that the application is a continuing  one
    until a decision is made so that further evidence may  be  provided  at
    any point between application and decision. However, that has now  been
    overturned by the Court of Appeal in Raju 2013 EWCA Civ  754  and  that
    judgement represents a statement of the law as it always was.

14. Of course, it was the Khatel point which led to  permission  to  appeal
    being granted.

15. As to the removal aspect no challenge has been made as to  the  Judge's
    decision to allow the appeal against  removal  to  the  limited  extent
    referred to above.

16. As to article 8, it seems to me the Respondent is correct  to  say,  in
    the rule 24 response, that article 8 still falls to be considered  even
    where there is no  imminent  threat  of  removal.  However,  here,  the
    Appellant did not raise article 8 in the grounds of appeal despite  the
    person who drafted the order 24 reply seeming to think he did.

17. In any event, it is clear from the determination that  the  matter  was
    not pursued before the Judge. Further, there was no evidence put before
    the Judge with respect to article 8 issues. There is, for  example,  no
    reference to such matters in the Appellant's witness statement of  14th
    March 2013.

18. In light of all the above, I conclude the Judge did not make a material
    error of law. The determination shall stand.

19. As Mrs Pettersen acknowledges, the upshot of the  Judge's  unchallenged
    decision as to removal means that  the  Appellant  cannot,  as  matters
    stand, be forcibly removed from  the  UK  unless  and  until  a  lawful
    decision as to that is taken.
