                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Colvin promulgated on 13th August 2013 in which  she  allowed
        the appeal under the Immigration Rules against the refusal  of  the
        Secretary of State to vary Ms Fardi's leave so as to permit her  to
        remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant. The Secretary of  State  also
        issued a direction for her removal pursuant to section  47  of  the
        Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.


     2. Ms Fardi was born on the 4th June 1980 and is an Iranian  national.
        Her immigration  history  shows  she  entered  the  United  Kingdom
        lawfully on 7th April 2011 with a Tier  1  (General)  Migrant  visa
        valid until 26th January 2013.  The current  application  was  made
        'in time' on 21st December 2012 and refused on the 1st  March  2013
        because the Secretary of State found that although she had  claimed
        points for earnings of �35,182.03 in the UK she  had  not  met  the
        requirements to be awarded a minimum of 80 points under Appendix  A
        of the Immigration Rules.


     3. Judge Colvin considered the written and oral evidence and  set  out
        what she thought to be  the  applicable  legal  self  direction  in
        paragraphs 9 in 10 of the  determination.  In  paragraph  11  Judge
        Colvin noted that the documentary  evidence  supported  Ms  Fardi's
        claim that her income was in  fact  �51,181  and  that  the  lesser
        figure had been submitted in error.  The Judge also found  that  Ms
        Fardi tried to correct the error during  a  telephone  conversation
        with UKBA in January 2013 prior to the refusal decision and despite
        being told she will be written to, this did not happen.  The  Judge
        accordingly found that on the basis of her acceptance of the higher
        earning figure Ms Fardi was entitled to 30  points  in  respect  of
        earnings, meaning she had the requisite number of points to  enable
        her to succeed with her application, as result of which the  appeal
        was allowed.


     4. The Secretary of State sought permission to  appeal  on  the  basis
        that section 85A of the Nationality,  Asylum  and  Immigration  Act
        2002 states  that  evidence  can  only  be  considered  if  it  was
        submitted with  the  application  and  that  at  the  date  of  the
        application Ms Fardi did not have the  required  evidence  to  show
        that she met the requirements of the Rules. The grounds allege  the
        Judge failed to give adequate reasons for why  she  considered  she
        was able to admit evidence that arguably  she  was  prevented  from
        considering by the statutory provisions.  The grounds  also  allege
        the Judge failed to apply the principles set out by  the  Court  of
        Appeal in Raju and others [2013] EWCA Civ 754 in which it was  held
        that an applicant had to provide all the information at the date of
        application.



Discussion



     5. In paragraph 9 of  her  determination  Judge  Colvin  set  out  the
        correct legal  self  direction  relating  to  section  85A  and  in
        paragraph 10 states the following:


              10. There is now the decision in Rodriguez  (Flexible  Policy)
   [2013]  UKUT                   00042  which  refers  to  the  'evidential
   flexibility' policy document                  relevant to the  processing
   and determination of applications under                the PBS.


     6. Rodriguez is subject to an appeal to the Court of Appeal as, on the
        face of it, it appears to be contrary to the decision of that court
        in Alam and others [2012] EWCA Civ 960. Whilst  onward  appeals  do
        not prevent a judge from relying  upon  an  authority  it  is  also
        relevant to note that the policy upon which that decision is  based
        expired on 30th June 2011.  The Secretary of State issued a further
        policy although for all applications made after 6th September  2012
        the 'evidential flexibility' policy has now been incorporated  into
        the Immigration Rules at paragraph 245AA, the  current  version  of
        which states:


          245AA. Documents not submitted with applications


          (a)     Where Part 6A or any appendices referred  to  in  Part  6A
   state that specified                  documents  must  be  provided,  the
   Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer           or  the  Secretary
   of  State  will  only  consider  documents  that  have   been   submitted
   with the application, and will only consider  documents  submitted  after
   the                 application where they are  submitted  in  accordance
   with subparagraph (b).


          (b)     If the applicant  has  submitted  specified  documents  in
   which:


              (i)      Some of the documents in a sequence have been omitted
   (for example, if                 one bank  statement  from  a  series  is
   missing);


              (ii)     A document is in the wrong format (for example, if  a
   letter is not on                      letterhead paper as specified); or


              (iii)    A document is a copy and not an original document; or




              (iv)     A document does not  contain  all  of  the  specified
   information;
                  the Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration  Officer  or  the
   Secretary  of  State                may  contact  the  applicant  or  his
   representative  in  writing,  and  request  the                   correct
   documents.  The   requested   documents   must   be   received   at   the
   address specified in the request within 7 working days of the date of the
                  request.


          (c)     Documents will not be requested where a specified document
   has not been                 submitted (for example an  English  language
   certificate  is  missing),  or  where  the               Entry  Clearance
   Officer,  Immigration  Officer  or  the  Secretary  of  State  does   not
   anticipate  that  addressing  the  omission  or  error  referred  to   in
   subparagraph (b)             will lead to a grant because the application
   will be refused for other reasons.


          (d)     If the applicant has submitted a specified document:


              (i)      in the wrong format; or


              (ii)     which is a copy and not an original document; or


               (iii)     which  does  not  contain  all  of  the   specified
   information, but the missing                  information  is  verifiable
   from:


                  (1)  other documents submitted with the application,


                  (2)  the website of  the  organisation  which  issued  the
   document, or


                  (3)  the website of the appropriate regulatory body;


          the application may be granted exceptionally, providing the  Entry
   Clearance Officer,      Immigration Officer or the Secretary of State  is
   satisfied  that  the  specified  documents         are  genuine  and  the
   applicant  meets  all  the  other  requirements.  The   Entry   Clearance
   Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of State reserves the right
   to request the           specified  original  documents  in  the  correct
   format  in  all  cases  where  (b)  applies,   and   to            refuse
   applications if these documents are not provided as set out in (b).


     7. The Judge failed to give adequate reasons  for  why  the  statutory
        provisions were not  determinative  on  the  facts  and  failed  to
        consider the decision in Raju in which the Court of Appeal made  it
        clear that AQ (Pakistan) v  SSHD  [2011]  EWCA  Civ  833  was  "not
        authority for the  proposition...  that  applications  were  "made"
        throughout the period starting with the date  of  their  submission
        and finishing with the date of the decisions" and the  decision  in
        Khatel and others (s85A; effect of continuing  application)  [2013]
        UKUT 00044 (IAC) to the contrary was set aside.  As  a  result  the
        documents Judge Colvin  considered  should  only  have  been  those
        submitted with the  application  if  she  accepted  that  a  lawful
        decision had been made.


     8. I find Secretary of State has established that Judge Colvin  failed
        to give adequate reasons for why the restrictions contained in  the
        statutory provisions, reinforced by decided authorities,  were  not
        applicable to the facts  of  the  case  advanced  by  Ms  Fardi.  I
        therefore set the determination aside and shall proceed  to  remake
        the decision.


     9. There is no challenge the factual findings set out in paragraph  11
        of the determination which shall be preserved  findings  and  which
        are in the following terms:




          11. I have had the benefit of receiving  oral  evidence  from  the
   appellant and being              able to ask  questions  to  clarify  her
   account. I have had no reason to disbelieve her             and found her
   to be a genuine and  credible  witness.  She  has  also  put  together  a
   comprehensive and relevant bundle of documents. These  include  documents
     from her accountants, from HMRC  and  invoices  relating  to  her  self
   employed            business. It is on the basis of these documents  that
   I find that she did err in her            original statement  as  regards
   herself    employed    earnings    with    her    company.      It     is
   acknowledged by her accountants that she could have  included  the  three
          invoices issued in November into her accounts for that period even
   though they             were not yet paid. There are letters  from  these
   three people confirming receipt of            the invoices which have now
   been paid in July 2013 as  shown  in  the  appellant's               bank
   statements. I therefore find that  her  total  earnings  for  the  period
   ending              30th of November 2012 was �51,181.  I also find  that
   the appellant tried to correct            this error during  a  telephone
   conversation with UKBA in January 2013 prior to              the  refusal
   decision but was told that she would be returned  to  and  this  did  not
     happen.  There is also no doubt in this case  that  the  appellant  has
   fully adhered           to immigration requirements in the past.


    10. The remaining issue is, on the  face  of  it,  relatively  straight
        forward in that Ms  Fardi  accepts  that  when  she  completed  the
        application made on 21st December 2012 she incorrectly stated  that
        her income was the lower of the two figures referred to above, as a
        result of the omission by her of three invoices.  She accepts  that
        she did not therefore provide the information that she later sought
        to rely upon with the application  which  the  Secretary  of  State
        argues is fatal to her claim as it is only evidence  provided  with
        the application that can be taken into account.  What is  different
        in  this  case  is  that  having  discovered  the  error  Ms  Fardi
        telephoned UKBA and explained to them what had occurred. The  Judge
        accepted that this telephone call was made in  January  2013  which
        was shortly after the date of application, and before the  date  of
        decision. Ms Fardi was told  that  she  would  be  written  to  yet
        received no further correspondence until the  refusal  notice.   An
        earlier letter of 28th December 2012 acknowledging receipt  of  her
        application specifically states "please do not send any  additional
        documents to us unless requested to do so by a case  worker".  This
        is the standard letter issued to all applicants.


    11. As a result of the advice given during the telephone call Ms  Fardi
        was entitled to await further correspondence from the Secretary  of
        State, especially in light of the  content  of  the  28th  December
        letter referred to above.  Notwithstanding the fact she had advised
        UKBA there were missing documents all she received was the  refusal
        of her application  on  one  ground  only,  that  relating  to  the
        availability of earnings which the missing documents  related  too.
        Had the application been refused for other reasons  that  may  have
        been the end of it, but it was not.


    12. In Alam v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 960 the Court of Appeal  held  that
        even in the context of such  a  statutory  scheme  the  public  law
        requirement of fairness must still be  observed  and  fairness  may
        impose additional obligations on the Secretary of State as decision
        maker under the PBS.


    13. I find Ms Fardi's treatment  has  been  conspicuously  unfair.  The
        application for leave to remain was refused because of her  failure
        to produce documents which she had proving her actual earnings were
        above the minimum required level but which  she was never asked  to
        produce,  despite  her  informing  UKBA  of  their   omission   and
        availability.  Given that the case worker, to whom some credit must
        be given for noting an error made by Ms Fardi in  relation  to  the
        points  claimed  on  the  basis  of  her  age  and  correcting  the
        application accordingly, was no doubt aware of the consequences  of
        s. 85A when he or she made the decision in this case the  Secretary
        of State was under a common law duty to act fairly in deciding this
        application; whereas her conduct in  relation  to  this  matter  is
        tainted with unfairness.


    14. This is not a case in which the Secretary of State had no knowledge
        that additional evidence existed as the  telephone  call  was  made
        advising her of  what  had  occurred.   It  is  arguable  that  the
        fairness requirement should have led to Ms Fardi  being  contacted,
        as she was told she would be, and being given  the  opportunity  to
        file the additional documents. The  case  worker  could  then  have
        decided whether to admit them, on the basis of  discretion  outside
        the rules/statutory provisions if necessary, or  to  have  rejected
        them but to have given adequate reasons either way.  In  this  case
        the case worker did nothing.


    15. In light of the above I find that there has been a  breach  of  the
        public law requirement of fairness which  in  this  appeal  imposed
        additional obligations upon the Secretary of State as the  decision
        maker. I find that the refusal is therefore not in accordance  with
        the law and that the matter must be returned to  the  Secretary  of
        State for a lawful decision to be made, as both advocates accepted.
        A failure to act fairly is a failure to act in accordance  with the
        law and a failure to  make a decision in accordance with the law is
        a ground  of  appeal  to  the  tribunal  under  s.84(1)(e)  of  the
        Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.


    16. I also note the removal direction made pursuant to  section  47  of
        the 2006 Act and no indication that this  decision  was  withdrawn.
        The making of such a decision contemporaneously with the  rejection
        of the substantive appeal, at the date of this decision, is also  a
        decision that is not in accordance with the law. Section 51 of  the
        Crime and Courts Act 2013 substituted a new  sections  47  (1)  and
        (1A) into the Nationality and Immigration Act  2006  from  8th  May
        2013 (Crime and Courts Act  2013  (Commencement  no  1)  Order  (SI
        2013/1042).  The amendment to s.47 is not retrospective.


Decision

    17. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal  is  allowed  to  the  limited  extent  it  is
        remitted to the Secretary of State.


   Anonymity.


    18. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


          I make no  such  order  (pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
   Procedure (Upper        Tribunal) Rules 2008) as there was no application
   for anonymity and such an        order is not justified on the facts.
