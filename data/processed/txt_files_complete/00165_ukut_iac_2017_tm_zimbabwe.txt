Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms F Connolly, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Presenting Officer (7 November 2016)
     Ms M O'Brien, Presenting Officer (23 February 2017)

   1. Schedule 1, paragraph 1 (d)  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
      Area)  (Amendment)  Regulations  2012  (SI  2012/1547)   amended   the
      definition of EEA national to  exclude  those  who  are  also  British
      Citizens, but that change was subject to the  transitional  provisions
      set out in Schedule 3 of those regulations.   Similar provisions  were
      added to the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016  by
      the Immigration (European Economic Area) (Amendment) Regulations  2017
      (SI 2017/1) which amended schedule 6 of the 2016 Regulations by adding
      a new paragraph 9.



   2. Although the reg 1 (2) of the 2016 regulations revoked the Immigration
      (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, they are preserved for  the
      purposes of appeals, as are the rights of appeal by  an  amendment  to
      Schedule 4  of  the  new  EEA  Regulations  made  by  the  Immigration
      (European Economic Area) (Amendment) Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/1).



   3. While the representatives regulated by OISC and members of the Bar  of
      Northern Ireland are both entitled under section 84 of the Immigration
      and Asylum Act 1999 to provide immigration services, section 11 of the
      Code of Conduct of the Bar of Northern  Ireland  precludes  barristers
      from taking instructions from  persons  other  than  lawyers  who  are
      governed by a professional body (which does not include OISC).


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge S T Fox,  dismissing  his  appeal  under  the  Immigration
   (European Area) Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 EEA Regulations")  against  a
   decision made by the respondent on 6 February 2015 to refuse to issue him
   with a residence card as confirmation of his permanent right of residence
   as the spouse of an EEA citizen.


2. The appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe. He is married  to  CM  who  holds
   dual Irish and  British  citizenship.   It  is  his  case  that  she  was
   exercising Treaty rights as an EEA national,  from  February  2009  until
   September 2014, and that as he had been married to her during  the  whole
   of that period, he was entitled to a residence card pursuant to  reg.  15
   of the 2006 EEA Regulations.


3. Although the respondent accepted  that  CM  had  been  exercising  Treaty
   rights between February 2009 and February 2013 and  again  from  November
   2013 until present, she was not satisfied that she  had  been  exercising
   Treaty rights between  those  dates,  and  thus  there  was  a  break  of
   continuity of residence. The respondent noted that although it  had  been
   said that this period had been due to unpaid maternity leave, no evidence
   to that effect had been provided, nor was there  sufficient  evidence  to
   show that she had the relevant sickness insurance policy  to  demonstrate
   that she was self-sufficient during this period.


4. On appeal, Judge Fox found:


      i) Following McCarthy v SSHD [2012] EUECJ  C-434/09,  as  CM  had  not
         exercised Treaty Rights, she could not at any point be said  to  be
         exercising Treaty Rights, and so the appeal fell to be dismissed in
         any event [17];


     ii) Even were the appellant to have shown McCarthy did not apply, there
         was insufficient evidence to show that CM was  self-sufficient,  or
         that she had been in receipt of Employment  and  Support  Allowance
         and/or Disability Living Allowance, despite claiming that  she  had
         been unable to work owing to being ill [ 14], [19 ]- [20].


5. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  on  the
   grounds that Judge Fox had erred:


      i) In failing to take account of the transitional  provisions  in  the
         Immigration (European Economic Area) (Amendment)  Regulations  2012
         (SI 2012/1547) ("the 2012 Regulations"), the effect  of  which  was
         that the appellant fell to be treated as the family  member  of  an
         EEA national, the decision in McCarthy notwithstanding;


     ii) In misapplying reg.6 (2) of the 2006  EEA  Regulations  in  holding
         that in order to show CM was ill or unable to work, she  needed  to
         show that had been in receipt  of  either  Employment  and  Support
         Allowance ("ESA") or Disability Living Allowance ("DLA"); and,  had
         failed to explain why he had rejected the evidence of Ms M's GP.

The Law


6. As at the date of decision, and the  hearing  on  7  November  2016,  the
   relevant regulations were the 2006 EEA Regulations. Although Schedule  1,
   paragraph 1 (d) of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  (Amendment)
   Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1547) amended the definition of EEA national to
   exclude those who are also  British  Citizens,  (subsequent  to  the  ECJ
   handing down judgment in  McCarthy),  that  change  was  subject  to  the
   transitional provisions set out in Schedule 3 which provided, so  far  as
   is relevant:


      Amendments to the definition of EEA national

      2.-(1) Where the right of a family member ("F") to be admitted to, or
      reside in, the United Kingdom pursuant to the 2006 Regulations depends
      on the  fact  that  a  person  ("P")  is  an  EEA  national,  P  will,
      notwithstanding the effect of paragraph 1(d) of Schedule  1  to  these
      Regulations, continue to be  regarded  as  an  EEA  national  for  the
      purpose of the 2006 Regulations where the  criteria  in  subparagraphs
      (2), (3) or (4) are met and for as long as they  remain  satisfied  in
      accordance with subparagraph (5).

      (2) ...

      (3) The criteria in this subparagraph are met where F-

        (a) was on the 16th July 2012 a person with a right  to  reside  in
        the United Kingdom under the 2006 Regulations; and

        (b) on the 16th October 2012-

           (i) held a valid  registration  certificate  or  residence  card
           issued under the 2006 Regulations;

           (ii) had made an application under the 2006  Regulations  for  a
           registration certificate or residence card which  had  not  been
           determined; or

           (iii) had made an application under the 2006 Regulations  for  a
           registration  certificate  or  residence  card  which  had  been
           refused and in respect of which an appeal  under  regulation  26
           could be brought while the appellant is in  the  United  Kingdom
           (excluding the  possibility  of  an  appeal  out  of  time  with
           permission) or was pending (within the meaning of section 104 of
           the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

       ...

      (5) Where met, the criteria in subparagraph (2), (3) and  (4)  remain
      satisfied until the occurrence of the earliest of the following events-



      ...

        (d) the date on which F ceases to be the family member  of  an  EEA
        national; or

        (e) the  date  on  which  a  right  of  permanent  residence  under
        regulation 15 of the 2006 Regulations is lost  in  accordance  with
        regulation 15(2) of those Regulations.

      (6) P will only continue to be regarded as an EEA  national  for  the
      purpose of considering the position of F under the 2006 Regulations.


7. Since the hearing on 7 November 2016, the 2006 EEA Regulations have  been
   superseded by the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2016
   (the "new EEA Regulations") which adopted  the  same  definition  of  EEA
   national as set  out  in  Regulation  2  of  the  2006  EEA  Regulations.
   Although  initially  the  new  EEA  Regulations  did  not   include   the
   transitional provisions provided for in  the  2012  Regulations  set  out
   above, that was remedied by  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
   (Amendment) Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/1) which amended schedule 6 of  the
   new EEA Regulations by inserting the 2012 provisions set out above as new
   paragraph 9 of that Schedule.


8. On 28 October 2009, the appellant was issued with a residence card  valid
   for five years  and so fell within Sch3 article 2(3)(b) (i)  (see  Sch  6
   article 9 (3) (b )(i) of the new Regulations).  There  is  no  indication
   that any of the criteria in article 2 (5) (Sch 6 article 9 (6) of the new
   Regulations) apply, and thus he  was  entitled  to  the  benefit  of  the
   transitional provisions which preserve for him the original definition of
   EEA national which did not exclude those who were also British  Citizens.




9. For whatever reason, the judge  did  not  engage  with  the  transitional
   provisions set out above, and erred in his application of McCarthy which,
   due to those provisions was not determinative of the issues.


10. As the judge then went on  to  consider  at  [19]  -  [23]  whether  the
   appellant  could,  nonetheless,  have  succeeded,  that  error   is   not
   necessarily determinative of the outcome as the judge went on to consider
   whether Ms M had otherwise been a qualified person at all material times.




11. Reg. 6 of the 2006 EEA Regulations provided, so far as is relevant:
      6. (1) In these Regulations, "qualified person" means a person who is
      an EEA national and in the United Kingdom as-
          (a) a jobseeker;
          (b) a worker;
       ...
      (2) Subject to regulations 7A(4) or 7B(4), a person who is no longer
      working shall not cease to be treated as a worker for the purpose of
      paragraph (1)(b) if-
          (a) he is temporarily unable to work as the result of an illness
          or accident;
12. There is no indication that the judge  properly  engaged  with  reg.  6,
   given the emphasis on the appellant having  to  show  that  CM  had  been
   entitled to benefit.  The question he should have asked  is  whether  she
   had been temporarily unable to work,  and  given  that  she  did  return,
   whether that was indicative that, following Samin  v  Westminster  [2012]
   EWCA Civ 1468, there had been a realistic prospect of return to work.


13. Contrary to what the judge appears  to  have  considered,  there  is  no
   requirement for CM to  have  been  on  Employment  Support  Allowance  or
   Disability Living Allowance.  Further, the reasoning with respect to  the
   letter from the GP is infected by this error, the judge directing himself
   at [19] to the irrelevant issue of whether the appellant was able to look
   for work. While that might be relevant to eligibility for benefit, it  is
   not directly relevant to the issue under consideration.


14. For these reasons, I set the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  aside.
    It was not, however, possible to remake the  decision  there  and  then.
   That is because Ms Connolly had to withdraw, it  becoming  apparent  that
   the appellant's representatives were not solicitors (although  registered
   with OISC). That is because section 11 of the Code of Conduct of the  Bar
   of Northern Ireland precludes barristers from  taking  instructions  from
   persons other than lawyers who are governed by a professional body (which
   does not  include  OISC),  members  of  the  government  legal  services,
   employed barristers, members of  staff  of  ombudsmen  or  from  approved
   professional bodies which does not include OISC[1].


15. While the representatives regulated by OISC and members of  the  Bar  of
   Northern Ireland are both entitled under section 84  of  the  Immigration
   and Asylum Act 1999 to provide immigration services,  unknown  to  either
   the  representatives  or  Ms  Connolly,  she   could   not   take   their
   instructions. I adjourned the hearing for the issue of representation  to
   be resolved.


   Remaking the decision

16. By the time  that  the  appeal  came  before  me  again,  the  2006  EEA
   Regulations had been superseded by the new EEA Regulations.  Although the
   new regulations revoked the 2006 EEA Regulations by operation  of  reg  1
   (2), (and seemingly revoked all the appeal rights  thereunder)  they  are
   preserved for the purposes of appeals, as are the rights of appeal by  an
   amendment  to  Schedule  4  of  the  new  EEA  Regulations  made  by  the
   Immigration (European Economic Area)  (Amendment)  Regulations  2017  (SI
   2017/1) which introduces the following provision into Schedule 4:


      3.  Appeals


        (1) Notwithstanding the  revocation  of  the  2006  Regulations  by
        paragraph 1(1), those Regulations continue to apply-
           (a) in respect of an appeal under those Regulations  against  an
           EEA decision which is pending (within the meaning of  regulation
           25(2) of the 2006 Regulations) on 31st January 2017;


           (b) in a case where a person has, on 31st January 2017, a  right
           under those Regulations to appeal against an EEA decision.


        (2) For the purposes of this  paragraph,  "EEA  decision"  has  the
        meaning given in regulation 2  of  the  2006  Regulations  and  the
        definition of "EEA decision" in regulation 2 of  these  Regulations
        does not apply

17. By regulation 15 (1)  (b)  of  the  2006  EEA  Regulations,  a  non  EEA
   national acquires the right of permanent residence if he has  resided  in
   the United Kingdom with an EEA national  for  a  period  of  5  years  in
   accordance with the regulations.  In practical terms, that means that  he
   must show that he has in  that  period  complied  continuously  with  the
   requirement in reg. 14 to have been the  family  member  of  a  qualified
   person which in turn requires it to be shown that the EEA national has at
   all times in the relevant period been a "qualified person" as defined  in
   reg. 6. As set out above.

18. I observe in passing that the new EEA Regulations  are  worded  slightly
   differently, avoiding the use of "he".


19. I was greatly assisted by both representatives who were able  to  narrow
   down the issues before me.  It was agreed that CM had started  employment
   in 2009, and had worked until 8 February 2012 when she went on  maternity
   leave. The couple's child was born on 4 April 2012. Although CM  returned
   from maternity leave on 5 November 2012, she was unable to work  and  was
   then in receipt of statutory sick pay until  29  January  2013  when  she
   resigned owing to illness.    She  did,  however,  start  work  again  in
   November 2013, and has remained in employment since then.


20. The only  remaining  issue  between  the  parties  is  thus  whether  CM
   retained her status as a worker between February 2013 and  November  2013
   on the basis that she was temporarily unable to work  owing  to  illness,
   that is, does meet she requirements of reg. 6 (2) (a)?


21. I am satisfied that, following Samin  v  Westminster,  that  as  CM  did
   return to work, and has remained in work, the absence was  temporary.   I
   am satisfied also on the basis  of  the  letter  from  her  GP  dated  16
   February 2015 that he had been treating her  between  February  2013  and
   November 2013 for severe depression and that during that time is was  his
   advice to her that she was  not  fit  to  work.  While  on  the  previous
   occasion some doubt had been case on this letter owing  to  the  apparent
   discrepancy as to where the family were living in  2013,  that  has  been
   resolved and no submissions were made that this  letter  was  unreliable.
   In the circumstances, I find  that  the  letter  from  the  sponsor's  GP
   demonstrates that her absence from work was due to  illness.  It  follows
   therefore that the sponsor had retained her status as a worker, and  that
   accordingly, the appellant fulfils all the requirements of the  new  (and
   previous) EEA Regulations. I therefore allow the appeal on that basis.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

   1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error of law. I set it aside.


   2. I remake the decision by allowing the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
      (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.
