                                A S N HASSAN
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                           ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Katani & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This decision is to be read with:

      i) The respondent's decision  dated  16  January  2017,  refusing  the
         appellant's application for entry clearance  as  the  spouse  of  a
         refugee.

     ii) The decision by an entry clearance manager  dated  13  April  2017,
         maintaining the refusal.

    iii) The appellant's grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

     iv) The decision of FtT Judge Clough, promulgated on 18 January 2018.

      v) The appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT,  stated  in  the
         application for permission to appeal filed on 14 February 2018.

     vi) The grant of permission by FtT Judge Pooler, dated 4 April 2018.

 2. Mr Govan conceded that the grounds at paragraph 2 (i) disclosed  error.
    A discrepancy between the sponsor and the  appellant  over  whether  he
    left Sudan in January 2014 (as he said) or  in  October  2013  (as  she
    said) was the judge's one  reason  for  not  relying  upon  documentary
    evidence purporting to show  that  they  married  on  1  January  2012.
    Everything had turned on that.  The FtT made no other assessment of the
    reliability of the documents.

 3. Parties agreed on the following outcome.

 4. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.  The nature of the case is such  that  it
    is appropriate under section 12 of the 2002 Act and Practice  Statement
    7.2 to remit to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.   The  member(s)
    of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include Judge Clough.

 5. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
