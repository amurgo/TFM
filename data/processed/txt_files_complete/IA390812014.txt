                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge L S L Mensah, promulgated on  22nd  December  2014,  following  a
    hearing at Bradford on 2nd December 2014.  In the  determination,  the
    judge dismissed the appeal of the Appellant,  whereupon  the  Appellant
    applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Jamaica and was  born  on  29th  November
    1947.  She is a female.   She  appeals  against  the  decision  of  the
    Respondent Secretary of State, refusing her an extension  of  leave  to
    remain in the UK on the basis that she  suffers  from  various  medical
    conditions.  The decision she appeals against is dated  23rd September
    2014.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that,  although  she  came  to  the  UK  on  a
    visitor's visa in  order  to  see  her  children  here,  she  had  been
    suffering from chronic renal failure, heart failure, and  anaemia,  and
    had to be hospitalised in the UK, such that she cannot now return  back
    to Jamaica because she needs one to one care, which is not available in
    that country, because all her children are in the UK.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge observed how a comparison between the healthcare  systems  of
    the UK and Jamaica, whilst being different in their  standards,  cannot
    be used as a basis to remain in this country, given that the  Appellant
    could access in principal healthcare treatment in Jamaica in any event.
     The Appellant could not meet  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  and
    paragraph  276ADE  because  there  was  a  "paucity  of   evidence   to
    demonstrate the Appellant has lost all her ties to Jamaica which is the
    country she was born in and in which she appears to have lived life in"
    (paragraph 9).  She came to the UK in March 2014 as  a  family  visitor
    and had satisfied the Entry Clearance Officer that she  had  sufficient
    ties in Jamaica to ensure that she would return after the family visit.
     The judge also observed that,

         "There is no evidence she has paid for any of  the  healthcare  she
         has received and this appears to include registering with a UK  GP.
         I am concerned that the Appellant and  her  family  have  used  the
         visit visa system to access free UK healthcare and I am  unable  to
         clarify this position because  of  the  paucity  of  evidence  ..."
         (paragraph 11).

    The judge went on to hold that there were no exceptional  circumstances
    in this appeal and that the Appellant  could  not  succeed  even  under
    Article 8 after the application of the Razgar principles.   The  appeal
    was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 5. The grounds of application state that  the  judge  was  wrong  to  have
    simply assumed that the Appellant took medical care on the NHS when she
    had in fact paid for it privately at  the  Nuffield  Hospital  and  she
    enclosed with her application a doctor's fee  note  by  way  of  proof.
    This finding tainted  the  judge's  consideration  of  the  Appellant's
    appeal under Article 8 outside  of  the  Immigration  Rules  given  the
    summary dismissal  of  the  appeal.   Second,  the  judge  erred  in  a
    consideration of Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules by failing  to
    consider whether the Appellant was dependent on her  family.   If  this
    was the case then it would require  a  considered  proportionality  and
    public interest assessment which the judge had failed to carry out.

 6. On 5th May 2015, permission to appeal was granted.

 7. On 21st May 2015, a Rule 24 response  was  entered  by  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State to the effect that the judge considered the evidence
    before her on a "paper appeal" and the judge could not be  faulted  for
    failing to consider evidence that was not before her.  Whereas  it  was
    clear that the Appellant had access to a GP it was not clear upon  what
    basis she had used that service.

Submissions

 8. At the hearing before  me  on  21st  April  2016,  Mr  Gleddon  Getten,
    appearing as McKenzie friend for his mother, the  Appellant,  explained
    that the Appellant had various illnesses before she came to the UK, but
    in this country she  got  worse  soon  after  arrival  and  had  to  be
    hospitalised.  He said that she had not come to this  country  to  seek
    medical help.  She came to visit  her  children.   These  included  the
    McKenzie friend himself and his two sisters.  He said that he  had  not
    seen his mother in Jamaica since 2011.

 9. For her part, Mrs Pettersen submitted that even if the judge had made a
    mistake in relation to the Appellant's access to medical  care  in  the
    UK, the judge dealt with Article 8 quite specifically at paragraphs  12
    to 13, and this consideration was not tainted by the judge having  made
    a mistake  of  fact  in  relation  to  access  to  medical  healthcare.
    Although the  grounds  of  permission  states  that  a  proportionality
    assessment was not done, the only medical evidence before the  Tribunal
    at the time was from the GP and this was unclear.  This  was  a  "paper
    case" and the Appellant had come as a visitor.  If she  now  wished  to
    remain as a dependent relative she had to make a separate  application.



10. Mr Gleddon Getten interrupted to  say  that  such  an  application  had
    indeed been made.  To this, Mrs Pettersen  replied  that  a  "dependent
    relative" application could not be made in-country, but had to be  made
    out of the country, following the Appellant's return back  to  Jamaica,
    and this was the reason why it had not been  considered  but  summarily
    dismissed.

11. In his reply, Mr Gleddon Getten stated that his mother, the  Appellant,
    was coming up to 70 years of age.  He said that  the  GP's  letter  was
    sent to say that she needed a one to one care.  At the  time  that  the
    application was made the Appellant had not overstayed.  She  had  leave
    to remain.  He said that no one in Jamaica was left to provide her with
    one to one care.  It was not a question  of  hospitals  and  healthcare
    being available.  It was a question simply of whether anyone could look
    after her on a daily basis in the way that she could  be  looked  after
    here within her family.



No Error of Law

12. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  My reasons  are
    as follows.

13. First, there is the question of the mistake of fact made in relation to
    access to medical care.  It has to be remembered that this was a "paper
    hearing".  The Appellant did not attend.  No evidence was  given.   The
    only evidence that the judge had was in  relation  to  the  Appellant's
    access to a GP and there was a "paucity of evidence"  in  this  regard.
    Evidence has now been produced  before  me  for  the  purpose  of  this
    hearing.  There is a letter from Mr Paul  Glossop  FRCS,  a  specialist
    providing private healthcare, to the effect that, "an  appointment  has
    been made for you to have a nasendoscopy under the care of  Mr  Glossop
    on Monday 23rd March 2015 ... ...".   It  goes  on  to  say  that  "the
    hospital charge for this  procedure  will  be  �97.00  payable  to  the
    Nuffield on the day of the procedure.  Mr Glossop's fee will be a  �100
    and an invoice for this will be sent to you following this  procedure".



14. A nasendoscopy is a way of looking at the soft palate (in the  roof  of
    the mouth) and the throat and involves using a thin, flexible tube with
    a very small telescope at the end, which is  passed  into  one  of  the
    patient's  nostrils.   It  would  appear  to  be  a  means   by   which
    investigation can be conducted in the upper  aerodigestive  tract  from
    everything from nasal foreign body through  to  malignancy.   There  is
    then attached to the documentation an invoice from the Nuffield  Health
    Wolverhampton Hospital for �97, with the name of the consultant Mr L  P
    Glossop, inserted.  There is also a letter dated 5th March 2015 from Mr
    Paul Glossop himself for �120.  None of this  evidence  indicates  that
    the Appellant needs one to one care.  None of  it  indicates  that  the
    Appellant is particularly poorly.  There is still  no  proper  evidence
    from the GP before this Tribunal, as there was not  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  Any error, therefore, by way of a mistake by the  judge
    at first instance, cannot have been a material error, such as  to  lead
    to that decision being set aside.

15. Second, as far as Article 8 is concerned none  of  the  evidence  here,
    presented in what was a "paper hearing", can have demonstrated  that  a
    decision on  proportionality  was  required  together  with  a  further
    assessment of the public interest requirement, other  than  that  which
    the judge had already undertaken.  It remains open  to  the  Appellant,
    were she to be a dependant, to make a dependent relative application.

Notice of Decision

16. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

17. No anonymity direction is made.
