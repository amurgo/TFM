Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Iqbal (instructed by Pride Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants appeal to the Upper Tribunal against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Brenells)  by  which,  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 17th January 2014, he dismissed the Appellants'  appeals
    against the Secretary of State's decisions  to  refuse  them  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant and his dependant spouse.

 2.  The  application  was  refused  solely  on  the  basis  of  the  first
    Appellant's previous earnings. The Secretary  of  State  noted  in  the
    refusal that he had  claimed  points  for  earnings  of  ï¿½67,372;  that
    appendix A of the Immigration Rules required applicants to  provide  at
    least two different types of supporting  evidence  of  each  source  of
    earnings, each piece of evidence from a different source.  The  refusal
    notes that  the Appellants had  provided  an  Accountant's  letter  and
    accounts but that  these derived from the same source and as such  were
    not acceptable.

 3. That was the only reason for the refusal.

 4. Before the First-tier Tribunal   the Appellants  were  represented,  as
    now, by Mr Iqbal. The Judge  dismissed the appeal  on  the  basis  that
    evidence put before him amounted to post decision  evidence  and  could
    not be taken into account.

 5. Permission to appeal was sought and granted by a Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal  who thought it arguable that  First-tier  Tribunal   had
    made a material error of law in that the  Judge   had  not  taken  into
    account HSBC business  bank  account  statements  which  the  Appellant
    indicated were submitted with his application and which  were  included
    in the Respondent's bundle.

 6. Before me Mr Nath helpfully acknowledged that no issue was  taken  with
    the Accounts in  the  refusal  by  the  Secretary  of  State.  He  also
    acknowledged that the  Accounts  and  the  bank  statements  were  from
    different sources. He also helpfully confirmed that the bank statements
    taken together with the Accounts would satisfy the requirements of  the
    rules.

 7. That left only the issue of whether the bank statements were  submitted
    to the Secretary of State with the application. It is true  that  there
    is no reference to them in the decision. However, I was referred to the
    application form submitted to the Secretary of State by the  Appellants
    (in the Respondent's bundle) and in particular to Page  36  wherein  is
    listed the evidence submitted with the application. Next  to  "Previous
    Earning" it lists wage slips, bank  statements  business  accounts  and
    dividend voucher. I am therefore  prepared  to  accept,  based  on  the
    contents of the application form and also the fact  that  the  relevant
    bank statements are included  in  the  Respondent's  bundle,  that  the
    Appellant did submit the appropriate evidence with the application  and
    it was overlooked by the Secretary of State.

 8. In failing to take those bank statements into  account  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  made  a  material  error  of  law  and  I   set   aside   the
    determination.





 9. I remake the decision and on the basis of the evidence contained in the
    Respondent's bundle I  am  satisfied  that  the  bank  statements  were
    submitted with the application and accordingly the Appellants ought  to
    have succeeded. They met the requirements of the Rules.  Their  appeals
    are therefore allowed under the Immigration Rules.


Signed                              Date 11th March 2014


Upper Tribunal Judge Martin



TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeals  and  because  a  fee  has  been  paid  or  is
payable, I have considered making a fee award and have  decided  to  make  a
fee award of any fee which has been paid for the following  reason:-  It  is
plain from my findings above that the Appellants ought to have succeeded  on
the basis of their applications and evidence submitted to the  Secretary  of
State.  Had the Secretary of State taken all of the  evidence  into  account
there would have been no necessity for an appeal.
