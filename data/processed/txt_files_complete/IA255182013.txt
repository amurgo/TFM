                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1) The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, born on 7 July 1974.   By  letter
   dated 8 May 2013 the respondent refused her application for a  derivative
   residence card under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations
   2006 ("the Regulations").  The letter  advised  the  appellant  that  her
   entitlement to remain in the UK had been assessed solely on the basis  of
   the Regulations, and that if she wished to make  any  other  application,
   such as on the basis of family and private life interests under Article 8
   of the ECHR, this was now incorporated within the Immigration Rules and a
   separate  application  should  be  made.   In  the  absence  or  such  an
   application, the respondent had not considered whether removal  from  the
   UK would breach Article 8.

2) First-tier Tribunal Judge Balloch dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  by
   determination promulgated on 28 February 2014.  Paragraph 30 records  the
   submission for the appellant that "if the present appeal is refused  then
   there will be refusal directions and Article 8 should therefore be  heard
   in the present appeal."  At paragraph 31  the  judge  said  that  in  the
   circumstances she made no findings in respect of  Article  8,  because  a
   full application could be made for consideration by the respondent.

3) The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is on the grounds that the  judge  erred
   by failing to address whether removal would breach the appellant's or her
   family's Article 8 rights.  Reference is made to JM v  SSHD  [2006]  EWCA
   Civ 1402 (which is reported at [2007] Imm AR 293).

4) Mr Bali submitted that a judge was bound  to  determine  all  grounds  of
   appeal placed before her.  He said that this was a case  which  ought  to
   have succeeded not outside but within the Immigration Rules.

5) I pointed out that an appeal cannot  be  allowed  under  the  Immigration
   Rules in an appeal brought under the Regulations.  Mr Bali submitted that
   nevertheless it was desirable for all matters to be resolved in  the  one
   process without further application.

6) Representatives were unable to refer me to any reported  case  in  point,
   other than JM, either of the Upper Tribunal or of any Court.  Mr Bali was
   vaguely aware of a case called Ahmed.  He did not have the citation,  but
   he thought the case held that Article 8 could  be  raised  on  an  appeal
   under the Regulations.

7) I reserved my determination.

8) The case which Mr Bali  had  in  mind  is  Ahmed  [2013]  UKUT  00089,  a
   successful appeal under the Regulations  in  which  Article  8  was  also
   considered.  However, the correct approach to Article 8 in  a  case  like
   this was not the main topic.

9) JM does hold that a removal decision is not  required  before  Article  8
   issues may be considered.  The situation in that case was very  different
   from this.  It did not arise from an appeal under  the  Regulations,  but
   was a refusal to vary leave.  At the point of the appeal being dismissed,
   the appellant would be put in  the  position  of  committing  a  criminal
   offence.   There  was  no  offer  from  the  respondent  to  look  at  an
   application raising family and private life or other human rights issues.
    JM is not an authority for looking at the present case on the assumption
   that removal will follow on the failure of the appeal.

10) Particularly since the July 2012 amendments to the Rules, any Article  8
   consideration must begin  by  addressing  the  family  and  private  life
   provisions in the Rules.  However, the ground that a decision is  not  in
   accordance with the Rules  is  not  available  on  an  appeal  under  the
   Regulations, for the following reasons.

11) Regulation 26 provides the right of appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal.
   Schedule 1, paragraph 1, states which provisions of the 2002 Act  are  to
   have effect in an appeal under the Regulations.    Section  84(1)(a)  and
   (f) are excepted.  The ground of appeal at (a) is "that the  decision  is
   not in accordance with immigration rules", and at (f)  "that  the  person
   taking the  decision  should  have  exercised  differently  a  discretion
   conferred by immigration rules".

12) Schedule 1, paragraph 1 of the  Regulations  does  not  give  effect  to
   section 120 of the 2002  Act  in  an  appeal  of  this  nature,  and  the
   respondent does not appear in this case  to  have  served  any  purported
   notice requiring the appellant  to  state  any  additional  grounds.   An
   extension of grounds of appeal to include the Immigration Rules could not
   arise in that way.

13) On the other hand the ground of appeal that a decision is  unlawful  for
   incompatibility with ECHR rights (section 84(1)(c) of the  2002  Act)  is
   available on an appeal under the  Regulations.   Section  86(2)  applies,
   which obliges a judge to determine "any matter  raised  as  a  ground  of
   appeal (whether or not by virtue of section 85(1)".  However, a Judge can
   only deal with a ground of appeal which it is legally competent to raise,
   and that does not include grounds going to the Immigration Rules.

14)  Substantive consideration of  family  and  private  life  issues  would
   inevitably involve looking at the Rules, but  the  appeal  could  not  be
   allowed under the Rules, even if their requirements were met.  And surely
   an appeal could not be allowed on human rights grounds outside the  Rules
   when a route under the Rules existed?

15) The answer I think is that the Article 8 ground of appeal had  form  but
   no substance, because there is no meaningful interference with Article  8
   rights when an appellant is invited to submit any application open to her
   for consideration under the Rules.  There is no right to be excused  from
   making an application.  There is no  good  reason  for  considering  this
   appeal as if removal was a present threat, opening up  grounds  of  wider
   scope.

16) That answers the question which was live at the hearing.  Since  then  I
   have noticed some other features of the case worth  mentioning,  although
   there were no submissions on them, and they do not  change  the  outcome.
   The notice served on the  appellant  is  headed  "notice  of  immigration
   decision" as well as "refusal to issue a residence card".  Such a refusal
   is not an immigration decision as defined in section 82(2)  of  the  2002
   Act, so the heading is at first sight odd.  Schedule 1,  paragraph  1  of
   the Regulations applies certain provisions of the 2002 Act to  an  appeal
   under the regulations "as if it were an  appeal  against  an  immigration
   decision under section 82(1)" but that does not appear to me to make  the
   decision into an immigration decision.   However, section 105 of the 2002
   Act and regulations made thereunder do have effect in an appeal under the
   Regulations, and section 105 empowers the respondent to "make regulations
   requiring a person to  be  given  written  notice  where  an  immigration
   decision is taken in respect of him".  The notice in this  case  is  made
   "in compliance with the Immigration  (Notices)  Regulations  2003",  made
   under section 105.  That explains the heading.  The  relevant  provisions
   do not bring back by a roundabout route the excluded  grounds  of  appeal
   under section 84(1)(a) and (f).

17) The notice goes on to list grounds on which the  appellant  is  entitled
   to appeal "under section 82 [of the 2002  Act]  and  Regulation  26",  as
   follows:

            that the decision is not in accordance with immigration rules

            that the decision is unlawful because it racially  discriminates
       against you

            that the decision breaches rights which you have as a member  of
       an EEA National's family under Community Treaties relating to  entry
       to or residence in the United kingdom

            that a discretion under the immigration rules should  have  been
       exercised differently

            that the decision is otherwise not in accordance with the law

18) The list does not seem to correspond with the grounds in section  84  of
   the 2002 Act or with those provided by the Regulations.  As far as I  can
   see, it wrongly includes grounds (a) and (f) relating to the  immigration
   rules and wrongly omits grounds (c) incompatibility with ECHR rights  and
   (g) removal would breach UK's obligations under the Refugee Convention or
   would be incompatible with ECHR rights.  A ground of appeal  can  neither
   arise from nor be removed by an erroneous statement by the respondent.

19) The form of notice, including the statement of grounds of appeal, is  in
   common use.  I have been able to find it readily in several other  cases.
   If my apprehension that its terms are defective is correct, it is  hardly
   surprising that confusion arises about the issues which properly arise on
   appeals under the Regulations.

20) It is also somewhat difficult to reconcile what the letter  accompanying
   the notice says about making  arrangements  to  leave  the  UK  with  the
   suggestion that an application be made under  the  Rules.   However,  the
   overall sense of the notice and letter, read together,  with  invitations
   at the end to make further applications under the Rules or Regulations if
   their terms can  be  met,  is  that  the  threat  of  removal  is  wholly
   insubstantial.  That is the decisive point in this appeal.






21) In the present  case,  the  determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   should have dismissed the appeal under reference  to  Article  8,  rather
   than "making no findings" at �31, because there was a ground and  a  duty
   to resolve it.  The determination should not have referred at �32 to  the
   respondent's decision being "in accordance with the law  and  Immigration
   Rules and with the Regulations", because there was no  ground  of  appeal
   under the Rules.  However, the final decision is simply, "the  appeal  is
   dismissed".  That correctly disposes of all issues, so the  determination
   shall stand.
