                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the appellant against a decision of Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Place ('the Judge')  sent  to  the  parties  on  14
    November 2019 by which the appellant's appeal against decisions not  to
    grant him indefinite leave to remain on the basis of ten years'  lawful
    residence and, alternatively, on human rights (article 8)  grounds  was
    refused.

 2. Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Nightingale  granted  the  appellant
    permission to appeal on all grounds by a decision sent to  the  parties
    on 10 June 2020.

 3. The appellant is represented by Universe Solicitors. Grounds of  appeal
    were authored on his behalf by John Walsh, Counsel.

 4. The respondent relies upon a 'rule 24' response, authored by Alain Tan,
    Senior Presenting Office.

Rule 34

 5. This decision is made without a hearing under rule 34 of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 ('the 2008 Rules').

 6. In light of the present need to take precautions against the spread  of
    Covid-19, and the overriding objective expressed at rule  2(1)  of  the
    2008 Rules, and also at rule 2(2)-(4), Upper Tribunal  Judge  McWilliam
    indicated by a Note and Directions sent to the parties on  17  November
    2020 her provisional view that it would be appropriate to determine the
    following questions without a hearing:

         i)  Whether  the  making  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
            involved the making of an error of law, and if so


        ii) Whether the decision should be set aside.

 7. Upon receiving and considering a rule 24 response from the  respondent,
    I considered whether it was appropriate to consider this  appeal  under
    rule 34. In undertaking such consideration, I noted the guidance of the
    Supreme Court as to circumstances when an oral hearing is to be held in
    order to comply with the common law duty of  fairness:  Osborn  v.  The
    Parole Board [2013] UKSC 61; [2014] AC 1115. I also observed the recent
    judgment of the High Court in JCWI v. President of the  Upper  Tribunal
    (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) [2020] EWHC 3103 (Admin),  at  [6.1  -
    6.14].

 8. Being mindful of the position  adopted  by  the  respondent,  which  is
    addressed below, and observing both the importance of these proceedings
    to the  appellant  and  the  overriding  objective  that  requires  the
    Tribunal to deal with cases fairly and justly, I am satisfied  that  it
    is just and fair to proceed to consider this matter under rule 34.

Anonymity

 9. The Judge did not issue an anonymity direction and no request for  such
    direction has been made in the written submissions before me.

Background

10. The appellant is a national of Nigeria and is aged 38. He  was  granted
    entry clearance as a Tier 4 (General) Student,  valid  from  14  August
    2009 until 31 January 2012, and entered this country  on  10  September
    2009.

11. He was granted leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post-study Work) Migrant on
    21 September 2010 following an in-time application.

12. On 10 October 2012 the appellant made an  out-of-time  application  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student. The application was made
    within 28 days of the expiry of his previously granted leave to  remain
    on 8 October 2012. The respondent granted him leave to remain  in  this
    category until 30 January 2015.

13. The appellant's leave to remain as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student  was
    varied on three subsequent occasions, with such leave ultimately varied
    to expire on 28 June 2018.

14. On 26 June 2018 the appellant applied  in  time  for  leave  to  remain
    outside of the  Immigration  Rules  ('the  Rules')  so  that  he  could
    continue with  his  studies.  The  application  was  initially  refused
    without a right  of  appeal  on  16  January  2019  but  following  the
    initiation of judicial review  proceedings  the  respondent  agreed  to
    reconsider the application.

15. The application was again refused by the respondent by a decision dated
    27 August 2019, accompanied by an attendant right of appeal.

16. On 6 September 2019, the  appellant  exercised  a  statutory  right  of
    appeal against the decision of 27 August 2019: HU/15098/2019.

17. On 11 September 2019, the appellant applied  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain on long  residence  grounds  under  the  Rules.  The  respondent
    refused the application  by  a  decision  dated  3  October  2019.  The
    appellant exercised a statutory right of appeal: HU/16979/2019.

18. Both appeals  were  heard  by  the  Judge  sitting  at  Nottingham  who
    dismissed them after a hearing held on 11 November 2019.

19. The appellant was granted permission to appeal on all grounds by  Judge
    of the First-tier Nightingale who observed at [3]-[4] of her decision:

         '3. The grounds are arguable. It is clear from  paragraph  36  that
            the Judge accepted the appellant's leave had  been  extended  by
            Section 3C [of  the  Immigration  Act  1971]  and  that  he  had
            achieved ten years' lawful residence continuously in the  United
            Kingdom. It is arguable that the Judge fell into  error  by  not
            taking  into  account  the   appellant's   fulfilment   of   the
            Immigration Rule relating to private life on the basis  of  long
            residence  in  the  proportionality   balancing   exercise   (TZ
            (Pakistan) applies).


         4.  It is also arguable that the Judge fell into error at paragraph
            28 by raising an issue regarding one of the appeals  before  the
            Tribunal which had  not  been  raised  by  the  respondent.  The
            respondent considered the appellant to have a valid leave appeal
            against the application for  long  residence  and,  indeed,  had
            considered that application and issued an  appealable  decision.
            In view of the lack of issue between the parties, it is arguable
            that the Judge fell into error in raising this without notice to
            either of the parties to address this concern. This  ground  is,
            too, arguable.'


Decision on error of law

20. By means of his rule 24 response Mr. Tan confirmed the position of  the
    respondent. I detail the response in its entirety:

         'In response to the directions sent by the Tribunal on 18  November
         2020, the SSHD as respondent does not oppose the grounds lodged  on
         behalf the appellant. The First-tier Judge  (FTTJ)  at  [26]  found
         that the appellant enjoyed s.3C  leave  as  a  consequence  of  the
         refusal of his human rights application on 27 August 2019 (although
         recorded incorrectly as 3 October 2019, the correct dates noted  at
         [25]) having appealed that decision. Whilst the  appellant  made  a
         subsequent application on 11 September 2019 for Indefinite Leave to
         Remain, at this point the appellant had already accrued  by  virtue
         of his enjoyment of s.3C leave (from 10 September 2009) a period of
         ten years continuous lawful residence on the basis of  the  finding
         at [26]. The FTTJ failed to take this fact into account at the date
         of hearing on 11 November 2019, thus it is accepted that  the  FTTJ
         erred in [her] consideration  of  whether  the  appellant  met  the
         Rules, and it is accepted that the consideration under Article 8 is
         therefore flawed.


         Whilst it was open to and legally correct for the FTTJ to find that
         s.3C(4) prohibits the person from making a further application  for
         variation of leave to remain, s.3C(5) does not prohibit a variation
         of the application that is yet to be decided. This is reflected  in
         the SSHD's Long Residence guidance 28 October 2019 (page 23):


             'The applicant completes 10 years continuous lawful  residence
             while awaiting a decision of an appeal.


             A person may complete 10  years  continuous  lawful  residence
             whilst they are awaiting the outcome of an appeal  and  submit
             an application on this basis. Under sections 3C and 3D, it  is
             not possible to submit a new application while  an  appeal  is
             outstanding.  However,  the  applicants  can  submit   further
             grounds to be considered at appeal.'


         Whilst the appellant did not vary the first application or formally
         seek to raise meeting the Rules under  the  ILR  route  as  a  'new
         matter', it is evident that the issue of meeting the long residence
         requirement was an issue since it was the  subject  of  the  second
         appeal reference (both appeals being linked by  the  Tribunal)  and
         parties made submissions on the matter.


         On the basis that it is accepted that the FTTJ erred in the central
         issue of whether the appellant  had  accrued  10  years  continuous
         lawful residence, the Tribunal is invited to set aside the decision
         and allow the appeal under Article 8 with reference to the guidance
         set out in OA and Others (human rights; 'new matter'; s120) Nigeria
         [2019] UKUT 65 (IAC).'

21. The reference by the respondent to OA and Others  (human  rights;  'new
    matter'; s120) Nigeria [2019] UKUT  65  (IAC),  [2019]  Imm.  A.R.  647
    concerns the confirmation by a Presidential panel of this Tribunal that
    in  a  human  rights  appeal  under  s.82(1)(b)  of  the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ('the  2002  Act')  the  fact  that  an
    appellant has completed ten years' continuous  lawful  residence  while
    their  appeal  is  pending,  and  therefore  claims  to  have   brought
    themselves within the  ambit  of  paragraph  276B  of  the  Rules  will
    generally constitute a 'new matter' within the meaning of s.85  of  the
    2002 Act.

22. The respondent is correct to make such concession. Whilst the Judge was
    mindful of the judgment of the High Court in R. (on the application  of
    Bhgat) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2014]  EWHC  772
    (Admin), [2014] 1 W.L.R. 3710, a matter in which a  second  application
    by the claimant for leave to remain  as  a  Tier  1  (Post-study  Work)
    Migrant, made at a time when his appeal  against  the  refusal  of  his
    first application was  outstanding,  was  found  to  be  prohibited  by
    s.3C(4) of the Immigration Act 1971, her attention was not drawn either
    to the respondent's guidance or to the decision of the Tribunal in OA &
    Others. Consequently, the Judge's decision is adversely impacted  by  a
    material error of law and must be set aside.

Remaking the decision

23. In remaking the decision, I observe the respondent's consent  that  the
    Tribunal can properly consider as a new matter in these proceedings the
    issue as to whether the appellant meets the requirements  of  paragraph
    276B of the Rules. I further note the respondent's concession that  the
    appellant does meet such requirements.

24. I therefore find  that  the  appellant  satisfies  the  long  residence
    requirements of the Rules and so his appeal on human rights (article 8)
    grounds is allowed.

25. Upon the respondent accepting that the  appellant  meets  the  relevant
    requirements  of  the  Rules,  I  am  not  required  to  consider   the
    appellant's appeal in relation to article 8 outside of the Rules.


Notice of Decision

26. The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  dated  14  November  2019,
    involved the making of a material error on a point of law  and  is  set
    aside.

27. The decision is remade, and the  appeal  is  allowed  on  human  rights
    (article 8) grounds.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have allowed the appellant's appeal in both matters.

I am satisfied  that  the  respondent's  decision  of  27  August  2019  was
reasonable on the basis of the  information  before  the  decision-maker  at
that time, the appellant not having sought to rely upon the  long  residence
requirements of the Rules prior to such consideration. No fee award is  made
in relation to appeal number HU/15098/2019.

The  respondent  now  accepts  that  it  was  clear  that  she  should  have
considered her policy guidance in respect of the appellant's long  residence
application at the time of the second decision,  dated  3  October  2019.  I
therefore make a fee award in favour of the appellant. The respondent is  to
pay the appellant's fee of �140 in relation to appeal number  HU/16979/2019.
