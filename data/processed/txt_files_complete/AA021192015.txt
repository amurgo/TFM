For the Appellant:     Ms Barton, Counsel instructed by Sabz Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a female national of C�te D'Ivoire born in 1992.  In a
    determination promulgated on the  30th  December  2015  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Nicholson) dismissed her appeal  on  asylum  and  human
    rights grounds[1]. The Appellant now has permission to  appeal  against
    that decision, granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio  on  the  26th
    October 2015.


 2. The background to this appeal was that the Appellant  had  entered  the
    United Kingdom as a visitor in May 2013. She  was  accompanied  by  her
    aunt. They came to see the Appellant's mother who had been living  here
    since approximately  1995.  In  November,  one  day  before  her  leave
    expired, the Appellant claimed asylum. She stated that she had a  well-
    founded fear of persecution in C�te D'Ivoire for reasons of her imputed
    political opinion and ethnicity. She is a member of the Bete tribe  who
    was caught  up  in  the  political  violence  that  followed  the  2010
    elections. That ethnic  group  are  associated  with  former  President
    Laurent Gbagbo.  In 2011 armed men came to  the  house  where  she  was
    living. They expelled  her  father  and  brother,  and  imprisoned  and
    repeatedly raped the Appellant and her cousin.  In a discrete Article 8
    claim the Appellant submitted that her removal from the United  Kingdom
    would be a disproportionate interference with her family life with  her
    mother and step-siblings.

 3. The Respondent rejected all of the material parts  of  the  Appellant's
    account and refused protection.

 4. The Appellant brought an appeal before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  She
    relied upon the asylum and human rights claims as originally put,  with
    the latter being significantly expanded by reliance on  a  relationship
    with an Ivorian national resident in the  UK.   The  Appellant  further
    relied upon Articles 3 & 8 ECHR, on the grounds that since her  arrival
    in the United Kingdom she had been diagnosed as HIV+.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal dismissed the appeal under all three heads of the  Appellant's
    claim.

 5. The Appellant now challenges that decision  on  the  grounds  that  the
    determination contains the following errors of law:

              i) Failure to make clear findings;
             ii) Wrong standard of proof;
            iii) Failure to consider material evidence;
             iv) Irrational Findings;
              v) Failure to make findings on a material aspect of the claim.

    Ms Barton, who did not draft the grounds of appeal, submitted that  the
    central failing was the apparently contradictory nature of some of  the
    findings, for instance at 49 the  Tribunal  does  "not  rule  out"  the
    possibility that the Appellant has been raped, whilst at 51  finds  the
    burden not discharged.


 6. Mr Harrison for the Respondent opposed the appeal in  respect  of  each
    ground.


    My Findings

 7. This is a long and extremely detailed determination. It is perhaps  for
    that reason that the author of the grounds, and I am bound to  say  the
    learned judge who granted permission, apparently did not manage to read
    it all with the care and attention it deserves.  In  January  2000  the
    Court of Appeal handed down its judgement in Karanakaran v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department EWCA Civ 11.  In that appeal  Brooke  and
    Sedley LLJ recommended that in  asylum  cases  decision  makers  should
    consider each part of evidence, determining what  they  believe  to  be
    true, that which they reject, and that which remains in  doubt,  before
    considering all of it together in a holistic balancing exercise.   That
    is precisely the formula that the First-tier Tribunal  has  applied  in
    this determination.


 8. The structure of the determination is as follows. The law is  set  out,
    then procedure, and a record of the evidence.  Under the  main  heading
    'analysis of evidence and findings' there are subheadings. The first is
    'factors in support of the Appellant's asylum claim'. Here the Tribunal
    records matters such as extracts from the background material which are
    capable of supporting what the Appellant has said.  For instance, it is
    accepted  that  there  was  terrible  violence  in  the  C�te  D'Ivoire
    following the December 2010 elections and that this  included  acts  of
    rape by unidentified armed men.  The next sub-heading is 'factors which
    do not support  the  Appellant's  asylum  claim'.  Here,  the  Tribunal
    catalogues a good number of  discrepancies  in  the  written  and  oral
    evidence. Under both sub-headings there are matters which the  Tribunal
    finds should be left in the balance. Once the evidence is addressed  in
    this way, the determination proceeds to make 'findings  on  the  asylum
    appeal'. That is where all of the evidence is weighed  in  the  balance
    and an overall judgement reached that the Appellant has not  discharged
    the burden of proof, a process foreshadowed by the express direction at
    paragraph 29.

 9. It is from this helpful and Karanakaran compliant framework,  that  the
    author of the grounds has picked out the 'inconsistent  findings'  that
    persuaded  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  grant  permission.  In  fact,
    properly understood, there are no inconsistent findings at  all.  Where
    the Tribunal records, at 34, that the Appellant's  account  is  broadly
    consonant with the country background material,  this  is  subsequently
    weighed against the fact that she  was  markedly  inconsistent  in  the
    account she gave across two asylum interviews and her oral evidence. As
    the determination itself notes at 35:

         "It follows that there is general  support  to  be  found  for  the
         Appellant's account in the background  evidence  albeit  that  this
         does not of course necessarily mean that the Appellant's account is
         actually true. These facts are no doubt well known to  many  people
         from Ivory Coast"

10. The fact that one to two elements of a claim  might  be  accepted,  and
    others left in the balance,  cannot  logically  compel  an  outcome  in
    favour of the Appellant, where other  negative  matters  are  found  to
    overwhelm them. I am not therefore satisfied that the central ground of
    appeal has been made out. The findings are perfectly  clear  and  there
    are no contradictions in the conclusions reached.


11. The second ground was an offshoot of  the  first.  The  author  of  the
    grounds calculates that the positive findings in the Tribunal are  more
    numerous than the negative, which all  arose,  it  is  said,  from  the
    mistakes of others, including the interpreter. It is submitted that  in
    those circumstances a proper application of the lower standard of proof
    would have resulted in the appeal being allowed.  This  ground  has  no
    merit. The point about the interpreter does not  appear  to  have  been
    raised at all before the grounds of appeal were drafted.  Moreover  the
    cumulative positive findings which have been made are  not  capable  of
    discharging the burden of proof. The acceptance that the  Appellant  is
    Ivorian, that there was political violence in the country  in  2010-11,
    and that she applied for a visit visa were not  factors  of  sufficient
    weight to have  justified  allowing  the  appeal,  even  on  the  lower
    standard of proof.

12. The third ground was that the Tribunal failed to  have  regard  to,  or
    give due weight to, material evidence.  The fourth ground is  that  the
    findings were irrational. I take these grounds  together  because  they
    both relate to the same particulars.

13. It is submitted that the Tribunal's findings on HIV were "unreasonable,
    irrational and erroneous" for  a  failure  to  take  into  account  the
    evidence of an expert witness, Dr Connelly of  the  Central  Manchester
    University Hospitals. The determination is  criticised  for  preferring
    the evidence in the Country of Origin Information  Report  (COIR)  over
    that apparently given by Dr Connelly.  I  say  apparently  because  the
    grounds do not say what his evidence might have been. All I could  find
    was a letter dated 22nd October 2014 in which Dr Connelly wrote:

         "Given all of the above [the Appellant's diagnosis]  and  with  the
         current precarious situation regarding healthcare  in  West  Africa
         and C�te D'Ivoire I think it would be an extremely unwise  decision
         if she were to  be  returned  and  I  support  her  application  to
         remain".

    Contrary to the suggestion in the grounds, that cannot be characterised
    as 'expert evidence' on the availability of  anti-retroviral  treatment
    in the C�te D'Ivoire.  Dr  Connelly  is  no  doubt  an  expert  on  the
    treatment that he is currently giving the Appellant, but  it  is  quite
    clear from his letter that he does not profess to  be,  nor  is  he  in
    fact, able to comment on the quality of the treatment  that  she  would
    likely receive at home.  The First-tier Tribunal was perfectly entitled
    to prefer the specific evidence set out in the COIR.

14. Further complaint is made about the Tribunal's alleged failure to  take
    into account  the  fact  that  the  discrepancies  in  the  Appellant's
    evidence might have arisen because  she  was  traumatised.  This  is  a
    pointless submission to make about a determination which contains  this
    paragraph:


         "I accept that anyone who has been raped may well be traumatised by
         the event. I accept that in those circumstances  considerable  care
         should be taken before drawing adverse inferences from descriptions
         of rape. I do not think in those circumstances that the Appellant's
         reference  at  her  screening  interview  to  a  single  armed  man
         necessarily means that her story is untrue. It  does  seem  to  me,
         however, unlikely  that  the  Appellant  would  have  said  in  her
         Statement of  Additional  Grounds,  written  some  time  after  her
         arrival in the United Kingdom, that she had been raped for a couple
         of days if, as she subsequently said in her witness statement,  she
         had been  raped  for  a  period  of  two  weeks.  Even  making  due
         allowances for the potential vulnerability  of  this  Appellant,  I
         conclude that that inconsistency does undermine the credibility  of
         her account"


    In light of that paragraph I find that the Tribunal did direct its mind
    to whether the inconsistencies may have arisen  because  the  Appellant
    was traumatised, and in doing so gave her the benefit of the  doubt  in
    some respects, whilst finding against her in others.  There  was  there
    no error in approach.

15. In respect of the Appellant's  claimed  relationship  with  an  Ivorian
    national in the UK, the Tribunal accepted that the  couple  were  in  a
    relationship, but that this was of an "uncertain" nature. The Appellant
    had described herself as single in her interviews and had  subsequently
    sought to explain this omission by saying  that  there  were  "ups  and
    downs" in their relationship. The Tribunal noted that  the  couple  did
    not live together, and had made no long term commitment  together.  The
    Tribunal specifically directed itself  to  consider  case-law  on  what
    might constitute a 'family life' in the context of unmarried  partners.
    The test, as ever, is whether this is a relationship of substance:  "In
    Balogun v UK (application number 60286/09) the European Court of  Human
    Rights  upheld  the  view  of  the  Tribunal  (on  the  facts)  that  a
    relationship with a girlfriend was not sufficiently settled, serious or
    long term to amount to a family life".   Having  considered  the  facts
    against that jurisprudence the First-tier Tribunal  was  not  satisfied
    that Article 8 was engaged. In the alternative the  determination  goes
    on to address proportionality.   This model answer is described in  the
    grounds as "the wrong conclusion". It is submitted that "it  is  simply
    not a plausible explanation for adverse findings".  The ground does not
    identify an arguable error of law in the approach taken by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal. The findings were based on  the  evidence  as  it  stood
    before the Tribunal, and taken in light of established principles.  The
    Tribunal did not make any "adverse  findings".  It  accepted  what  the
    witnesses had to say about their relationship (despite the reservations
    expressed by the Respondent).




16. The final ground was that the determination fails to address a material
    aspect of the claim, namely  that  the  Appellant  is  a  member  of  a
    particular social group, a woman who has suffered sexual  violence  and
    will therefore be stigmatised by Ivorian society.  It is  by  no  means
    clear to me that this was a matter that was advanced to the  First-tier
    Tribunal. I bear in mind that the Appellant was not represented at that
    hearing but she did have the  benefit  of  a  bundle  prepared  by  her
    representatives. There is nothing in that bundle which appears to go to
    whether the Appellant might face a real risk of serious harm  for  that
    reason. Nor does it appear to have been  raised  in  the  asylum  claim
    itself. The First-tier Tribunal cannot be  criticised  for  failing  to
    deal with an argument that was not put. Insofar as there might be  said
    to be an obvious impediment to a young woman returning to C�te D'Ivoire
    alone, this is dealt with at paragraphs 86-88. Finally, I note that the
    Tribunal had not accepted that the Appellant had been raped. Given that
    sustainable finding, there can have been no error in the  determination
    omitting to consider the question of stigma.
