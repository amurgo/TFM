Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mr A Rehman, Mayfair  Solicitors
For the Respondent:          Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.    The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 29th November 1986.  He
      appeals against the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  dated
      10th February 2014 dismissing  his  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
      decision of 30th April 2013 refusing to vary leave to  remain  outside
      the Immigration Rules.


2.    Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Clive  Lane
      on 9th May 2014 on the grounds that it was  arguable  that  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge P J M Hollingsworth had erred in law in failing to take
      into account the Appellant's income in concluding that  he  could  not
      meet the income threshold under the Immigration Rules.

3.    At the hearing before me, Mr  Rehman  submitted  that  the  Judge  had
      erred in law in failing to take into account the Appellant's income of
      �6,000 having found that the Sponsor's income amounted to �14,000. The
      Appellant had shown  that  he  met  the  income  requirements  of  the
      Immigration Rules. Further, the case 'fell on all fours' with Majid (R
      (on application of MM and others) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
      Department [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin).  In  the  circumstances  of  this
      case, the maintenance criteria were disproportionate.  The  Judge  had
      wrongly applied Gulshan (Article 8 - new  Rules  -  correct  approach)
      [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) because there  were  insurmountable  obstacles
      and exceptional circumstances in the Appellant's case. The Sponsor was
      not able to live in Pakistan and could not leave her  mother  who  was
      ill.

4.    Mr Whitwell submitted a letter dated  19th  May  2011  curtailing  the
      Appellant's leave. It was addressed  to  the  Appellant  c/o  Alperton
      College, which closed down in February 2011. Mr Whitwell accepted that
      he could not show that the letter had been served on the Appellant. He
      submitted that the application had been outside the Immigration Rules,
      the Appellant's  representatives  at  that  time  accepting  that  the
      maintenance threshold could not be met.

5.    In any event, the Appellant could not rely  on  the  Sponsor's  rental
      income  because  she  had  failed  to  submit  monthly  personal  bank
      statements covering 12 months. The rental contract did not start until
      August 2013. The Sponsor's and Appellant's income  did  not  meet  the
      threshold of �18,600. Any error on the part of the Judge  in  relation
      to the application of the Immigration Rules was not material. Further,
      the Appellant was seeking to rely on income for six months to cover  a
      period of 12 months. This was  not  permitted  under  the  Immigration
      Rules.

6.    Mr Whitwell submitted that the Judge properly  applied  the  two-stage
      test  set  out  in  Gulshan.  He  took  into  account  the   Sponsor's
      nationality, the Appellant's oral evidence and the Sponsor's  personal
      circumstances. The Judge properly analysed the facts and there was  no
      error in his approach to Article 8. The Sponsor's mother's cancer  was
      in remission since  2009.  There  were  no  exceptional  compassionate
      circumstances in this case. The fact that the Appellant had  continued
      working on his student visa  after  the  college  closed  down  was  a
      countervailing factor.

7.    Mr Rehman submitted that  if  an  application  was  made  outside  the
      Immigration Rules, the Judge was  entitled  to  take  the  Rules  into
      account  (SA  (Pakistan)  [2010]  UKUT  481).  The  Judge  still   had
      jurisdiction to hear  an  application  under  the  Rules  even  if  an
      application was not made on that basis.

8.    If Majid was followed, the Appellant did not need to meet Appendix  FM
      in terms of six months employment. Mr Rehman relied on paragraph 24 of
      Gulshan. The Appellant had permission to work under the terms  of  his
      visa and his leave continued by virtue of section 3C  Immigration  Act
      1971.


Discussion and conclusion

9.    The application for leave  to  remain  as  the  spouse  of  a  British
      citizen was made outside the Immigration Rules. The Appellant, through
      his representative at that time accepted that he could  not  meet  the
      income threshold of �18,600. The  Appellant's  representative  at  the
      hearing before the First-tier Tribunal accepted that  this  was  still
      the case. I am of the view that whether the  Appellant  could  satisfy
      the Immigration Rules was relevant to his  Article  8  assessment  and
      therefore the Judge was correct to make a finding on that issue.

10.   The  Judge  found  that  the  Sponsor  was  working  at  the  date  of
      application (paragraph 7 of his  determination).  He  found  that  her
      income was �10,994 and she received �3,900.94 rental income (paragraph
      13). He came to this conclusion on the basis of a  printout  submitted
      by  the  Appellant's  representative.  The   Judge   disregarded   the
      Appellant's claimed income. It was submitted that  the  Appellant  had
      been working since December 2013 and had earned �727.20 to date, which
      amounted to an annual income of �6526.

11.   It is clear from paragraph 13 of Appendix  FM-SE  that  the  Appellant
      was not entitled to rely on the income  he  claimed  in  the  printout
      submitted before the  First-tier  Tribunal  because  at  the  date  of
      application  (December  2012)  the  Appellant  was  not  working.  The
      Appellant started working on 2nd December 2013. The Judge did not  err
      in law in failing to take into account the Appellant's income.

12.   In addition, the  Appellant  had  failed  to  supply  12  months  bank
      statements showing the Sponsor's monthly rental income under paragraph
      10(a)(ii) of Appendix FM-SE. The  Appellant  could  not  rely  on  the
      Sponsor's rental income.

13.   Accordingly, the application could not succeed under  the  Immigration
      Rules. There was no material error of law in the Judge's finding  that
      the Appellant could not satisfy the maintenance  requirements  of  the
      Immigration Rules (paragraph 13 of his determination).

14.   In  relation  to  Article  8,  the  Judge  properly  directed  himself
      following Gulshan. He took into account the fact that the Sponsor  was
      a British citizen and had lived in the UK all her life. He  also  took
      into account her mother's illness and the support that the Sponsor and
      Appellant provided for her (paragraph 8). The Judge found  that  there
      were no insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside the
      UK nor were there  exceptional  circumstances  which  meant  that  the
      Appellant's removal would result in unjustifiably  harsh  consequences
      such that refusal was disproportionate under Article 8. These findings
      were open to the Judge on the evidence before him.

15.   I am not persuaded by Mr Rehman's submission that this case  "fell  on
      all fours with Majid". Blake J  did  not  strike  down  the  financial
      requirements of the Rules and he did not make a formal declaration. He
      found that there was substantial merit  in  the  contention  that  the
      interference represented by a combination of the five factors  in  the
      family life of the claimants on the assumed facts was disproportionate
      and unlawful. The Appellant's circumstances were different. The  Judge
      took into account all the circumstances of the  Appellant's  case  and
      his finding that the Appellant's refusal to vary leave to  remain  was
      proportionate was open to him on the evidence before him.

16.   The Judge made no error on any point of law which  might  require  the
      determination to be set aside. The appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is
      dismissed.  The determination of the First-tier Tribunal  dated  shall
      stand.
