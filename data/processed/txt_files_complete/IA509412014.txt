                                   Between

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                       (Anonymity Direction Not Made)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A Fijiwala, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr M Biggs, (Counsel) instructed by SEB solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    I have considered whether any parties require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

2.    The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal  but
in order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in  the
First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a
decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Majid, promulgated on  17  July  2015,
which allowed the Appellant's appeal.

Background

3.    The Appellant was born on 03 October 1987 and is  a  national  of  Sri
Lanka. On 5 December 2014 the Secretary of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
application for an EEA residence card.

The Judge's Decision

4.     The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   First-tier
Tribunal  Judge  Majid  ("the  Judge")  allowed  the  appeal   against   the
Respondent's decision.

5.    Grounds of appeal were lodged and on  4  November  2015  Judge  Andrew
gave permission to appeal stating inter alia

    "Whilst it is not an arguable error of law for the Judge to fail to set
    out in detail the contents of the refusal letter it is incumbent on the
    Judge to make clear in his decision  the  findings  that  he  makes  in
    relation to the evidence adduced in response to the concerns raised  by
    the refusal letter. In this decision the Judge has failed to do so.  He
    has also failed to make findings as to the weight that can be placed on
    the letter from the EEA sponsor's mother but appears to have taken this
    into account. Accordingly I am satisfied that there are arguable errors
    of law in the decision."

The Hearing

6.    (a)   Ms Fijiwala, for the respondent, referred me to the  grounds  of
appeal and told me that the Secretary  of  State's  position  has  not  been
considered by the Judge at all. It is  the  Secretary  of  State's  position
that the appellant and  sponsor  had  entered  into  a  sham  marriage.  The
Secretary of State relies on a marriage interview  which  is  reproduced  in
the respondent's bundle. No mention  of  the  marriage  interview,  nor  the
answers which the respondent believes discrepant, is made by  the  Judge  in
his decision. Ms Fijiwala told me that the Judge has  ignored  the  case  of
Papajorgji (EEA spouse - marriage of convenience) Greece [2012]  UKUT  00038
(IAC) and has failed to take guidance from  case  law.  In  his  summary  of
evidence, between [4] & [8] the Judge does not  set  out  what  evidence  he
accepts, nor why he finds that evidence persuasive.

      (b)   Ms Fijiwala took me to [10] of the  decision,  where  the  Judge
sets out his findings and conclusions, and told me  that  between  [10]  and
[14] what is recorded by the Judge is vague and  lacking  in  specification,
so that the objective reader cannot tell why the  Judge  made  the  decision
that he made. She urged me to set the decision aside and remit the  case  to
the First-tier Tribunal because (she said) the Secretary of  State  has  not
been given a fair hearing.

7.    Mr Biggs, for the appellant, vigorously opposed the  appeal  and  told
me that  the  grounds  of  challenge  really  amount  to  an  argument  that
insufficient reasons are given in the decision.  He  referred  me  to  South
Bucks District Council v Porter [2004] UKHL 33, and argued  that  the  Judge
had clearly focused on the one issue that is in dispute  and  made  findings
of fact which were open  to  the  Judge  to  make.  He  explained  that  the
appellant's bundle, placed before the First-tier, contains 281 pages and  is
the extensive evidence to which the Judge refers  at  [10(c)].  He  told  me
that the decision is not tainted by a material error of law, & urged  me  to
dismiss the appeal and allow the decision to stand.

Analysis

8.    At [7] the Judge sets out a summary of the appellant's oral  evidence.
At [4] the Judge narrates that he has witness statements for  the  appellant
and the sponsor which clarify  "some  points  of  the  evidence  before  the
caseworker".

9.    At [10(a)] the Judge clearly says that he relies on the oral  evidence
of the appellant, and at [15] the Judge concludes  that  the  appellant  and
sponsor are parties to a genuine marriage.

10.    The  difficulty  is  that  the  Judge  races  to  a  conclusion.  The
respondent's position is set out in the  reasons  for  refusal  letter.  The
Judge has given no consideration to the marriage interview,  and  the  Judge
has  not  explained  why  he  preferred  the  appellant's  evidence  to  the
respondent's evidence, nor  which  parts  of  the  appellant's  evidence  he
placed weight on.  The appellant's 281page bundle is not considered  by  the
Judge. In short there is no meaningful analysis of the  evidence  which  was
placed before the Judge.

11.   In MK (duty to give reasons) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 00641 (IAC), it  was
held that (i) It was axiomatic that a determination  disclosed  clearly  the
reasons for a tribunal's decision. (ii) If a tribunal  found  oral  evidence
to be implausible, incredible or unreliable or a document  to  be  worth  no
weight whatsoever, it was necessary to say so in the determination  and  for
such findings to be supported by reasons. A bare statement  that  a  witness
was not believed or that a document was afforded no weight was  unlikely  to
satisfy the requirement to give reasons.

12.   I can only come to the conclusion  that  the  summary  nature  of  the
decision indicates that the Judge has given inadequate reasons and that  his
fact-finding exercise is flawed. These are material errors of  law.  I  must
therefore set the decision aside.

13.   There is, however, sufficient evidence  before  me  to  enable  me  to
substitute a  decision.  I  have  before  me  the  respondent's  PF1  bundle
together with the appellant's bundle which contains the items listed on  the
index to the bundle. The respondent was not represented  before  the  First-
tier. No application was made from an adjournment.  If  the  respondent  was
happy for the case to be considered without representation before the First-
tier there is no reason why I should not proceed to determine this  case  of
new.

Findings of Fact

14.   The appellant is a national of  Sri  Lanka.  On  17  August  2010  the
appellant was granted leave to enter the UK as  the  dependent  of  his  Sri
Lankan wife, who was  present  in  the  UK  as  a  student.  The  respondent
extended leave to remain in the UK until 1 April 2014.

15.   Whilst in the UK the appellant's  marriage  to  his  Sri  Lankan  wife
broke down irretrievably. On 18 June 2014 decree of divorce was  granted  by
a Sri Lankan court.

16.   On 8 August 2014  the  appellant  married  Katarzyna  Bala,  a  Polish
national, in London.  Ms Bala ("The Sponsor") is an EEA national  exercising
treaty rights of movement as a worker in  the  UK.  The  appellant  and  the
sponsor have lived together  since  1st  July  2014  and  continue  to  live
together.

17.   On 23/02/2015 the sponsor's mother wrote a letter singing the  praises
of the appellant and confirming that the appellant and sponsor  are  parties
to a genuine marriage. Documents 79 to 191 of the appellant's bundle  record
communications  by  Viber,  mobile  phone  and  text  passing  between   the
appellant and sponsor between July  2013  and  January  2015.  They  contain
sequences of  messages  of  affection  passing  between  the  appellant  and
sponsor. Documents 192 to 279 of the appellant's bundle are a collection  of
photographs of the appellant and sponsor enjoying their own company both  at
home and on social engagements.

18.   The appellant and sponsor have matching tattoos to  demonstrate  their
commitment to each other. The appellant  and  sponsor  have  visited  Poland
together.

19.    On  21  November  2014  both  the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  were
interviewed by an immigration  officer.  Records  of  those  interviews  are
reproduced in the respondent's bundle. The appellant and sponsor  were  each
asked 197  questions.  The  respondent  believes  that  there  are  material
differences in seven of the answers given.

CONCLUSIONS

20.   In Papajorgji (EEA spouse - marriage  of  convenience)  Greece  [2012]
UKUT 00038 (IAC) the Tribunal held that  (i)  There  is  no  burden  at  the
outset of an application on a claimant to demonstrate that a marriage to  an
EEA national is not one of convenience; (ii) IS (marriages  of  convenience)
Serbia [2008] UKAIT 31 establishes only that there is an  evidential  burden
on the claimant to address evidence  justifying  reasonable  suspicion  that
the marriage is  entered  into  for  the  predominant  purpose  of  securing
residence rights; (iii) The guidance of  the  EU  Commission  is  noted  and
appended. The Tribunal in  Papajorgji made it clear  at  paragraph  33  that
they did not accept there was a burden as  such  on  the  Appellant  and  at
paragraph 39 stated "In summary, our understanding is that, where the  issue
is raised in an appeal, the question for the judge  will  therefore  be  'in
the light of the totality  of  the  information  before  me,  including  the
assessment of the claimant's answers and  any  information  provided,  am  I
satisfied that  it  is  more  probable  than  not  this  is  a  marriage  of
convenience?".(i.e the burden  lies  on  the  SSHD)   At  paragraph  32  the
Tribunal held that a visa should be issued promptly  on  application  unless
the  decision  maker  has  reasonable  grounds  to  suspect  a  marriage  of
convenience  and  the  evidential  onus  of  showing  that  there  are  such
reasonable grounds in the first place rests on the decision maker.

21.    In  R  (on  the  application  of  Adetola)  v   First-Tier   Tribunal
(Immigration and Asylum Chamber) and SSHD [2010] EWHC 3197  (Admin)  It  was
held that that Immigration Judges should be slow to  find  that  a  marriage
solemnised in the Church of England was a sham marriage  and  should  accept
the  marriage  certificate  as  proof  of  the  marriage,  albeit  that  the
certificate could be scrutinised to ensure it was genuine.

22.   The respondent's suspicion that this is a marriage of  convenience  is
based entirely on the performance of the appellant and sponsor  at  marriage
interview. The respondent believes  that  the  appellant  and  sponsor  give
differing accounts of the appellant's reason to come to the UK. The  sponsor
knows that the appellant's father died of cancer  but  does  not  know  what
sort of cancer that was. The appellant and sponsor give  differing  accounts
of the purchase price of the car. The appellant and  sponsor  arguably  give
different accounts of where they  spent  their  first  night  together.  The
appellant and  sponsor  differ  (by  �35)  on  their  account  of  household
expenses. The appellant and sponsor give differing accounts of how the  news
of their engagement was broken to the sponsor's mother.  The  appellant  and
sponsor give conflicting accounts of who paid for their wedding rings.

23.   When the entire interview is read it can be seen  that  the  appellant
and sponsor do not give entirely consistent accounts in those  seven  areas,
but in so far as there is an inconsistency it is not so radical as  to  form
either a conflict or contradictory account. If  the  appellant  and  sponsor
got  seven  questions  wrong,  then  they  got  190  questions  right.   The
respondent does not give the appellant and sponsor credit for correctly  and
consistently answering 96% of the questions.

24.   Against that there is reliable evidence placed before me of  courtship
throughout 2013 and 2014, leading to marriage. There  is  reliable  evidence
that the appellant and sponsor are the joint tenants of  the  same  domestic
property, having signed a lease on 4 May 2014. The photographic  evidence  &
the evidence of regular frequent messages of affection since  July  2013  is
evidence of a genuine relationship which blossomed into  the  commitment  of
marriage.

25.   I find that there is  no  basis  for  the  conclusions  drawn  by  the
respondent. I find that  the  differences  in  the  answers  given  by  each
appellant at marriage interview are small and inconsistent. The  differences
in the answers given by the appellant and sponsor at those interviews is  in
fact consistent with  a  genuine  relationship  characterised  by  different
memories of the same set of circumstances. It is evidence that  neither  the
appellant nor the sponsor concocted a story and committed it to memory.

26.   I therefore find that the appellant  and  sponsor  are  parties  to  a
genuine  marriage,  &  that  the  respondent  does  not  have  grounds   for
suspecting that they are parties to a marriage of convenience.

27.   In Agho v SSHD 2015 EWCA Civ 1198 it was held that where an  applicant
sought an EEA residence card on the basis that he  was  married  to  an  EEA
national, he  simply  had  to  produce  his  marriage  certificate  and  his
spouse's passport. If the Secretary of State wanted to refuse to  issue  the
card on the basis that the marriage was one of  convenience,  she  bore  the
burden of proving,  to  the  civil  standard,  that  the  marriage  was  not
genuine.

28.   I therefore find that the respondent  does  not  have  any  reason  to
doubt the validity of the marriage entered into between  the  appellant  and
sponsor.  I  find  that  the  appellant  fulfils  the  requirements  of  the
Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

Decision

29.   There is a material error on a point of law in  the  decision  of  the
First-tier Tribunal. I therefore set that decision aside

30.   I substitute the following decision.

31.   The appellant's appeal under the Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006
is allowed.
