Representation:

For the claimant: Mr M Sowerby
For the appellant:     Mr J Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Charles Kwake Antwi, date of birth 20.6.60, is a  citizen
    of Ghana.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio, who allowed  the  claimant's  appeal
    against the decision of the respondent to refuse him entry clearance to
    the United Kingdom as ZZ.  The Judge heard the appeal on 26.3.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Murray  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    20.5.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 10.7.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Adio should be set aside.

 6. Judge Adio found  the  claimant's  evidence  and  factual  account  not
    credible, particularly in relation to his claim that he would  be  made
    king or killed on refusal. Thus the non-medical claim under  article  3
    was rejected. The medical claim under article 3 was found not to  reach
    the high threshold necessary. The judge found that there  is  treatment
    available in Ghana and the medical evidence  demonstrates  that  whilst
    his cancer condition is serious and the prognosis  poor,  there  is  no
    indication that his life expectancy is dropping.

 7. There has  been  no  cross-appeal  against  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    findings and decision in relation to article 3 and they must  therefore
    stand.

 8. Judge Adio set out the claimant's appalling immigration history between
    �2 and �5 of the determination and it is clear from �38 that  this  was
    taken into account in the article 8  assessment.  However,  Judge  Adio
    went on to find, based exclusively on the claimant's health and medical
    condition, that his removal would breach the  claimant's  private  life
    rights under article 8 ECHR.

 9. The grounds of application for permission to appeal complain  that  the
    judge did not apply the Immigration Rules and in  particular  paragraph
    276ADE, or follow the guidance of Gulshan [2013] UKUT  00640  (IAC)  in
    identifying any compelling  circumstances  for  considering  the  claim
    outside the Immigration Rules and did not show that there would be  any
    unjustifiably harsh outcome if the  appeal  failed.  The  grounds  also
    state that the claimant's appalling immigration history  had  not  been
    properly considered and the only factor in his favour  was  his  health
    and health care services in Ghana.  It  is  submitted  that  article  8
    cannot be met.

10. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Murray  stated,  "It  is  clear
    from the determination that the  judge  was  aware  of  the  claimant's
    appalling immigration history and was aware of the  case  of  N  (2005)
    UKHL and that the claimant has not paid for the  medical  treatment  he
    has received in the UK. He considers the claim under Article 8 ECHR  at
    paragraph 35 onwards giving no reason as to why he  finds  there  is  a
    good arguable case for him to do so. He has not followed  the  relevant
    country guidance case law. There is an arguable error  of  law  in  the
    judge's determination."

11. When Judge Adio commenced from �35 of the determination to consider the
    claimant's article 8 claim,  which  comprises  private  life  only,  no
    reference was made to the Immigration Rules and paragraph 276ADE, which
    sets out the Secretary of State's response to article  8  private  life
    claims.

12. The refusal decision had addressed private life  under  276ADE,  noting
    that the claimant had not lived in the  UK  continuously  for  over  20
    years, as required under 276ADE(iii) and considered  that  he  retained
    linguistic, social and cultural ties to his home country where his wife
    and seven children remain. He arrived in the UK as  an  adult  and  has
    spent the majority of his  life  in  Ghana.  There  was  no  compelling
    evidence that he would  have  difficulty  in  returning  to  Ghana  and
    adapting to life in that country. The claimant's presence in the UK  is
    not conducive to the public good; he availed himself of  NHS  treatment
    to which he was not entitled and for which he has not paid.

13. Judge Adio completely ignored and failed to deal  with  the  claimant's
    private life claim under paragraph 276ADE. It may  have  been  arguable
    that the claimant's medical condition, state of  health  and  treatment
    regime were compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised in the
    Immigration Rules. However, there was no such consideration.  For  this
    reason alone the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was in  error  and
    cannot stand.

14. It is clear that in proceeding to consider  the  claimant's  article  8
    rights outside the Immigration Rules the First-tier Tribunal judge also
    failed to apply the principles enunciated in MF Nigeria [2013] EWCA Civ
    1192 in the Court of Appeal and Gulshan in the Upper Tribunal,  to  the
    effect that the Immigration Rules are to be regarded as a complete code
    and that an article 8 assessment should only be carried out where there
    are compelling circumstances not recognised  by  the  Rules  and  which
    would, exceptionally, render the decision of  the  Secretary  of  State
    unjustifiably  harsh,  referred  to  in  the  grounds  as   exceptional
    circumstances as defined in Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 Admin.

15. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640
    (IAC) the Upper Tribunal set out, inter alia, that on the current state
    of the authorities:

     (b)    after applying the requirements of the Rules, only if there may
         be arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  them
         is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether
         there are  compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised
         under them: R (on the application of) Nagre v  Secretary  of  State
         for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin);

    (c)    the  term  "insurmountable  obstacles"  in  provisions  such  as
         Section EX.1 are not obstacles which are impossible to surmount: MF
         (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012]  UKUT  00393  (IAC);  Izuazu
         (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 00045 (IAC); they  concern  the
         practical possibilities of  relocation.  In  the  absence  of  such
         insurmountable obstacles,  it  is  necessary  to  show  other  non-
         standard and particular features demonstrating that removal will be
         unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.

16. The Tribunal explained  that  the  Secretary  of  State  addressed  the
    Article 8 family aspects  of  the  respondent's  position  through  the
    Rules,  in  particular  EX1,  and  the  private  life  aspects  through
    paragraph 276ADE. The judge should  have  done  likewise,  also  paying
    attention to the Guidance. Only if there were arguably good grounds for
    granting leave to remain outside the rules was it necessary for him for
    Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether there  were  compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the Rules.

17. More recently, in Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)  [2014]  UKUT  00085
    (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held:

         (i)Failure on the part of the Secretary of State to identify in her
             decision any legitimate aim under Article  8(2)  of  the  ECHR
             does not prevent a court or tribunal from seeking to do so  on
             the basis of the materials before it.

          (ii)   "Maintenance of effective immigration control"  whilst  not
             as such a legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of  the  ECHR  can
             normally be assumed to be either an aspect of  "prevention  of
             disorder or crime" or an aspect of "economic well-being of the
             country" or both.

          (iii) "[P]revention of disorder or crime" is normally a legitimate
             aim both in expulsion cases  where  there  has  been  criminal
             conduct on the part of the claimant  and  in  expulsion  cases
             where there have only been breaches of immigration law.

          (iv)  MF  (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  held  that  the  new
             immigration rules regarding deportation of a foreign  criminal
             are  a  complete  code.  This  was  because  of  the   express
             requirement in  them  at  paragraph  398  to  have  regard  to
             exceptional circumstances and other factors.

          (v)    It follows from this  that  any  other  rule  which  has  a
             similar provision will also constitute a complete code;

          (vi) Where an area of the rules does  not  have  such  an  express
             mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State  for
             the Home Department [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin)  ([29]-[31]  in
             particular) and Gulshan (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -  correct
             approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after
             applying the requirements of the rules, only if there  may  be
             arguably good grounds for granting  leave  to  remain  outside
             them is it necessary for  Article  8  purposes  to  go  on  to
             consider  whether  there  are  compelling  circumstances   not
             sufficiently recognised under them.

18. There is an express  mechanism  within  paragraph  276ADE  to  consider
    exceptional circumstances where the applicant does not  meet  the  long
    residence requirement for leave to remain on the basis of private life.
    The consideration of ties to the home country, including family, social
    and  cultural,  is  in  effect  a  proportionality  or   reasonableness
    assessment. In those circumstances and  with  that  express  mechanism,
    which is to be regarded as a complete code,  there  may  have  been  no
    justification for the First-tier Tribunal Judge to go  on  to  consider
    private life under article 8 outside the Rules.

19. Even if paragraph 276ADE was not a complete code for assessment of  the
    claimant's private life, following Shahzad  private  life  outside  the
    Rules under article 8 ECHR, should not be  unless  there  are  arguably
    good grounds for doing so for considering  that  there  are  compelling
    circumstances  which  would  justify,   exceptionally,   allowing   the
    application under article 8 on the basis that the decision  produced  a
    result that was unjustifiably harsh.

20. On the facts of this case and  in  particular  the  claimant's  medical
    condition, state of health and  treatment  regime,  I  find  there  are
    arguably good grounds for  going  on  to  consider  whether  there  are
    compelling circumstances to justify consideration of article 8  private
    life outside the Immigration  Rules.  276ADE  recognises  private  life
    considerations in relation to family, social and cultural ties  to  the
    home country. It does  not  cater  for  serious  health  conditions  or
    circumstances where a patient is undergoing a course of treatment, even
    if the patient is not entitled to that treatment. Obviously, those  are
    factors of great concern to the claimant. However, for reasons set  out
    below,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  those  factors  were  sufficiently
    compelling to justify, exceptionally, granting leave to remain  on  the
    basis of private life under article 8 ECHR outside the Rules.

21. I find that undue weight was placed on the claimant's health issues  in
    the article 8 assessment and that highly relevant factors were ignored,
    in particular  that  the  claimant  was  unable  to  meet  any  of  the
    Immigration Rules for leave to remain, including paragraph 276ADE,  and
    the fact that he was not entitled to and  had  not  paid  for  the  NHS
    treatment he had obtained in the UK.

22. Having found that the claimant did not meet the threshold  for  article
    3, the judge allowed the appeal  under  article  8  ECHR,  but  did  so
    relying exclusively on the same medical evidence, despite that evidence
    not reaching the article 3 threshold. In essence, the judge was relying
    on the same article 3 claim evidence but  applying  a  lower  threshold
    under article 8. For the reasons stated herein that  was  an  error  of
    law.

23. In MM (Zimbabwe) v SSHD  [2012]  EWCA  Civ  279  the  Court  of  Appeal
    suggested that it makes no sense to refuse to recognise a medical  care
    obligation in relation to article 3, but to acknowledge it in  relation
    to article 8. At �23 of the decision Lord Justice Moses stated that the
    only cases he could foresee  where  the  absence  of  adequate  medical
    treatment in the country to which a person is to be  deported  will  be
    relevant to article 8, is where  it  is  an  additional  factor  to  be
    weighed in the balance, with other factors which by  themselves  engage
    article  8.  The  example  was  given,  "Supposing...the  claimant  had
    established firm family ties in this country, then the availability  of
    continuing medical treatment here coupled with his  dependence  on  the
    family here  for  support,  together  establish  'private  life'  under
    article 8." In MM family support in the UK was a key factor in  keeping
    well a person suffering from schizophrenia. That is not  the  situation
    of this claimant.

24. However, MM was further considered by  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Akhalu
    (health claim: ECHR Article 8) [2013] UKUT 00400 (IAC), which held:

          (1)  MM (Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
         [2012]  EWCA  Civ  279  does  not  establish  that  a  claimant  is
         disqualified from accessing the protection of article  8  where  an
         aspect of her claim is a difficulty or inability to  access  health
         care in her country of nationality unless, possibly, her private or
         family life has a bearing upon her prognosis. The correct  approach
         is not to leave out of account what is, by  any  view,  a  material
         consideration of central importance to the individual concerned but
         to recognise that the countervailing  public  interest  in  removal
         will outweigh the consequences  for  the  health  of  the  claimant
         because of a disparity of health care facilities in all but a  very
         few rare cases.

          (2)  The consequences of removal for the health of a claimant  who
         would not be able to access equivalent health care in their country
         of nationality  as  was  available  in  this  country  are  plainly
         relevant to the question  of  proportionality.  But,  when  weighed
         against the public interest in ensuring that the limited  resources
         of this country's health service are used to the  best  effect  for
         the benefit of those for whom they are intended, those consequences
         do not weigh heavily in the claimant's favour but speak cogently in
         support of the public interests in removal.

25. Thus medical care issues can be relevant to an article 8  ECHR  private
    life assessment,  if  that  stage  is  reached.  However,  it  must  be
    recognised  in  such  an  assessment  that  the  countervailing  public
    interest in removal, which with the  claimant's  appalling  immigration
    history is particularly significant, will outweigh the consequences for
    the health of the claimant  because  of  a  disparity  of  health  care
    facilities in all but a few rare cases.

26. In submissions, Mr Wilding also referred me to GS &  EO  (Article  3  -
    health issues) India [2012] UKUT 00397 (IAC).  The  claimants  in  that
    case had chronic irreversible advanced  kidney  disease,  the  cost  of
    which they could not meet in their home countries of India  and  Ghana.
    The panel found that GS would die without dialysis treatment within 1-2
    weeks. He could access that treatment in India, but could not afford to
    do so. His condition did not reach the  article  3  threshold  and  his
    appeal was dismissed. Similarly, it was  accepted  that  EO  would  die
    within 2-3 weeks and could not afford treatment in Ghana. His condition
    was not exceptional and did not reach the  article  3  threshold.  Both
    appeals were dismissed.

27. At �85(8) the Upper  Tribunal  confirmed,  obiter,  that  in  principle
    article 8 can be relied on in respect of health issues, on the basis of
    an interference with private life as an  aspect  of  that  individual's
    physical and moral integrity. Unlike article 3, however, article  8  is
    not absolute and the legitimate aim of the economic well-being  of  the
    country would be relevant in determining whether a breach of article  8
    could be established given any financial  implications  that  continued
    treatment in the UK would entail. In GS & EO, the Upper Tribunal  panel
    explained that in practical terms in a case where the claimant  has  no
    right to remain it will be a "very rare case" indeed where such a claim
    could succeed.

28. Mr Sowerby did not argue that the judge had failed to properly consider
    all the relevant evidence. I find that there  was  nothing  within  the
    evidence  summarised  within  the  determination  in  relation  to  the
    claimant's medical condition, health and treatment regime that  on  the
    facts of this case could  reasonably  be  considered  to  outweigh  the
    public interest in removal.

29. The article 8 assessment of the First-tier Tribunal does not appear  to
    take any account of the public interest in the removal of the claimant.
    At �37 the judge found that if removed it would affect his  quality  of
    life, that he would not be able  to  get  the  exact  treatment  he  is
    getting at the moment, and  that  stabilising  his  condition  is  very
    important to him to be able to enjoy a qualitative life.  Whilst  those
    may be relevant factors,  they  are  insufficient  in  a  private  life
    article 8 ECHR consideration to outweigh the  very  significant  public
    interest in this claimant's removal.

30. In the circumstances, and for the reasons stated, I find that there was
    an error of law in  the  making  of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal such that it should be set aside and remade.

31. In submissions as to the remaking of the decision, Mr Sowerby  referred
    me to some further medical  evidence,  comprising  5  medical  letters,
    three of which  are  appointment  letters,  which  I  have  taken  into
    consideration.

32. Mr Sowerby explained that the claimant had commenced a  new  course  of
    chemotherapy in January 2014 and completed the last  session  some  two
    weeks earlier. As confirmed by the outpatient letter he had a body scan
    on  20.6.14  and  is  awaiting  the  results.  Mr  Sowerby  sought   an
    adjournment to await the outcome. I refused  that  application.  It  is
    clear that the claimant's condition is serious, although Mr Sowerby was
    unable to say if it was terminal. However, I note that the letter  from
    Dr Bhatnagar dated 1.7.14 made the assumption that the chemotherapy  is
    palliative  treatment  but  noted  that  he  had   responded   to   the
    chemotherapy. The doctor thought that the claimant  would  not  survive
    long if returned to Ghana as there are no  medical  facilities  in  his
    country. That appears inconsistent with the other evidence  put  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.  The  same  doctor's  evidence  was  that  the
    prognosis was poor but that his quality of life was not so bad. In  the
    letter of 25.4.14 Dr Plowman stated that the  claimant  was  clinically
    much improved by the chemotherapy. The First-tier Tribunal Judge  found
    that there was similar chemotherapy treatment available to the claimant
    in Ghana and there was no evidence that life expectancy  was  dropping.
    The claimant is always going to have future and further  treatment  and
    reports. There remains no  evidence  to  suggest  that  the  claimant's
    condition has worsened and Mr  Sowerby  did  not  make  any  article  3
    submissions. In the circumstances, there seemed little if  any  purpose
    in postponing the decision further.

33. Taking account of the case law set  out  above,  and  for  the  reasons
    stated, I find that the claimant's circumstances when considered in the
    round, as a whole, are not so compelling and insufficiently  recognised
    in the Immigration Rules as to require or justify  consideration  under
    article 8 outside the Rules. Neither do I find  that  the  decision  is
    unjustifiably harsh. I have to bear in mind  that  the  claimant  still
    does not meet the article 3 threshold, as conceded by Mr  Sowerby.  His
    health condition is certainly serious and he may not be able to  afford
    treatment in Ghana resulting in serious consequences for him, but I  am
    satisfied that equivalent treatment remains available, as was the First-
    tier Tribunal.

34. However, even if the stage of an article 8 private life proportionality
    balancing exercise is reached following  the  Razgar  five  steps,  the
    Tribunal has to take account of not only the public interest in removal
    but the cost to the public by the claimant's  access  of  treatment  to
    which he is not entitled. As cited in Akhula, the UK cannot  afford  to
    be the world's hospital.

35. It is right, if this stage is reached, which I do not accept it is,  to
    have regard to every aspect of the claimant's private life  in  the  UK
    and the consequences for removal, as highlighted in  the  evidence  and
    the determination of the First-tier Tribunal. However, I have  to  bear
    in mind in striking the balance of proportionality that a comparison of
    levels of medical treatment is not something that will itself have  any
    real impact on the outcome of the exercise, even if it is an  important
    aspect of the claimant's case.

36. I also have to  take  into  account  that  he  has  not  been  able  to
    demonstrate that he meets any of the Immigration  Rules  for  leave  to
    remain; that he came to the UK unlawfully and has no right  to  remain;
    that  paragraph  276ADE  is  the  Secretary  of  State's  response  and
    consideration of private life claims under article 8; and the claimants
    immigration history. All previous claims including Judicial Review have
    been found to be without merit.  In  balancing  on  the  one  hand  the
    claimant's rights to respect for his private life and on the other  the
    legitimate aim of protecting the  economic  well-being  of  the  UK  by
    applying immigration control and the very significant  public  interest
    in removing the claimant, the balance comes down clearly in  favour  of
    removal and a finding that the decision is not  disproportionate.  This
    is not one of what could only be a very  small  number  of  rare  cases
    where  that  public  interest   is   outweighed   by   the   claimant's
    medical/health factors.

Conclusions:

37. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be  set  aside,  remade  and
    dismissed, for the reasons given.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on
                    all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
