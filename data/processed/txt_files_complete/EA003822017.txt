                            DECISION AND REASONS

         1. On 20th September 2018, I heard an appeal by Ms Boland  against
            a decision of the First-tier Tribunal and  made  the  following
            decision:


                               Error of Law and Directions


            1.  The  appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision   of   the
               respondent refusing  her  a  permanent  residence  card  was
               dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Carroll  for  reasons
               set out in a decision promulgated on 4th April 2018. He  had
               written the decision and signed it on 19th March 2018.
            2. The appellant had, on 7th March 2018,  notified  the  First-
               tier Tribunal that, contrary to what she  had  said  on  her
               appeal notice, she wished the appeal to be determined on the
               papers. When the First-tier Tribunal judge wrote the reasons
               for his decision, he did not have any  documentary  evidence
               from the appellant that supported her grounds of appeal  and
               he dismissed the appeal. It is not apparent that  there  was
               any indication on the file that documents were expected from
               the appellant and the date for filing documents as  set  out
               in the directions had passed.
            3. The appellant's solicitor, in a  witness  statement  to  the
               Upper Tribunal, states that when he spoke to a member of the
               Administrative staff at the First-tier Tribunal he was  told
               that the appeal had been transferred to  a  paper  list,  as
               requested, and that any documentary evidence  to  be  relied
               upon was to be sent to the First-tier Tribunal by 21st March
               2018. The solicitors sent a bundle of documents to the First-
               tier Tribunal. Although the solicitor says he was told  that
               the documents had arrived on 21st March 2018, they are  date
               stamped as having arrived on 22nd  March  2018.  I  note  in
               passing that the solicitor has not appended  his  attendance
               note  with  the  administrative  person  at  the  First-tier
               Tribunal.
            4. The First-tier Tribunal administration sent the documents to
               the judge who sent them back to the  administration  with  a
               note dated 29th March 2018 that the papers had been received
               "after promulgation". That note is incorrect - the judge had
               sent his decision to the promulgations team but it  was  not
               in fact promulgated until 4th April.
            5. The documents should have been considered by  the  judge  in
               reaching his decision and the judge  has  erred  in  law  in
               failing to consider them.
            6. Mr Lindsay submitted that the error was not material  -  the
               solicitors could have filed the documents  very  soon  after
               the request for the hearing to be  transferred  to  a  paper
               hearing but they were not; the documents had not been  filed
               in accordance with directions; there was no basis upon which
               the solicitors could or should have relied upon a  statement
               by an administrative member of staff as  to  when  documents
               could be filed; the documents had not been served  upon  the
               respondent who had not had an opportunity to  consider  them
               and therefore  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  could  have
               legitimately excluded them from consideration in any event.
            7. All the submissions made by the respondent  are  legitimate.
               The filing of documents at such a late  stage,  contrary  to
               directions and not served  upon  the  respondent  is  to  be
               deplored and may, in some circumstances, lead  to  costs  or
               other sanctions. The failure to comply with  directions  has
               resulted in direct expense to the appellant because  of  the
               application for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal
               and the hearing, and to public funds because the application
               had to be considered by an Upper Tribunal Judge, listed  for
               hearing and the  respondent  had  to  appear.  There  is  no
               apparent justification for such expense.
            8. Nevertheless, had the judge contacted the promulgations team
               to  establish  whether  in  fact  his  decision   had   been
               promulgated, he would have been  informed  it  had  not.  He
               would then have had to take a decision on what view to  take
               of the documents. That view could either have been to refuse
               to admit them (as submitted by Mr Lindsay) or he could  have
               adjourned consideration with a direction that the  documents
               be served on the respondent by  a  certain  date,  that  the
               respondent be given adequate time to consider the  documents
               and make representations, that  the  solicitors  provide  an
               explanation for late  filing   and  the  decision  be  taken
               thereafter.
            9. I therefore  conclude  that  the  error  by  the  First-tier
               Tribunal judge is material - it is not inevitable  that  the
               judge would have excluded the documents.
           10. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and make
               the following directions, which were  given  orally  at  the
               hearing  on  20th  September  and  take  effect  from   20th
               September 2018.


                    Directions


               The resumed hearing is listed for hearing at Field House  on
               23rd October 2018, the respondent now having the  bundle  of
               documents relied upon by the appellant.


               The appellant's solicitors to explain in writing by  4pm  on
               26th September 2018, marked for the attention of UTJ  Coker,
               why the documents relied upon  by  the  appellant  were  not
               filed in compliance with directions and why  they  were  not
               served upon the respondent[1].


         2. The essential difference in the submissions by Mr Hawkin and Mr
            Mills was that Mr Hawkin submitted that  the  documents  relied
            upon were sufficient to support the contention that  Ms  Boland
            had been exercising Treaty rights for five years such that  she
            was entitled to a  permanent  residence  card;  the  underlying
            question was whether she was self-employed and  self-sufficient
            prior to 1st January 2014; that it was possible in  considering
            whether she was entitled  to  a  permanent  residence  card  to
            consider the proportionality of the decision: she  is,  at  the
            date of the hearing only a couple of months short of five years
            employment as accepted by the respondent to be in  exercise  of
            Treaty Rights, that she has been resident in the UK  since  she
            was aged 15 i.e. nearly 19 years and well over  half  her  life
            and that she has three children all born in the UK  the  oldest
            two (aged 17 and 15) being British Citizens  and  the  youngest
            (aged 5) being  Romanian citizen.


         3. Mr Mills submitted that although there was some  evidence  that
            the appellant had been working and it was accepted  that  since
            2014 she had been exercising Treaty Rights, her self-employment
            work prior to January 2014 was minimal and/or did  not  support
            the submission that she had been working at  all  and  did  not
            cross the threshold to mean that she had been exercising Treaty
            rights for five years. He submitted that this appeal was not  a
            human rights appeal and, in  accordance  with  Amirteymour  and
            others (EEA appeals; human rights) [2015] UKUT 466 (IAC) "Where
            no notice under section 120 of the 2002 Act has been served and
            where no EEA decision to remove has  been  made,  an  appellant
            cannot bring a Human Rights challenge to removal in  an  appeal
            under the EEA Regulations. Neither the factual matrix  nor  the
            reasoning  in  JM  (Liberia)  [2006]  EWCA  Civ  1402  has  any
            application to appeals of this nature", proportionality of  the
            decision in human rights terms  was  not  the  subject  of  the
            appeal.

         4. Ms Boland is a Romanian citizen and self-employment  (prior  to
            1st January 2014 in this case), can be counted towards the five-
            year period. There was no dispute that the appellant  had  been
            exercising Treaty Rights since 1st January  2014.  The  dispute
            centred on whether the evidence of self-employment relied  upon
            by the appellant  for  the  period  to  1st  January  2014  was
            sufficient to make a  finding  that  she  had  been  exercising
            Treaty Rights during that period.

         5. The evidence she relies upon is:

               i) A letter from HMRC dated  12th  May  2016  stating,  inter
                  alia, that according to their records  she  was  "a  self-
                  employed individual for the tax years 2012-2013,  2013  to
                  2014 and 2014 to 2015. And you are still self-employed."
              ii) Tax calculation for 2012-13  (year  ended  5  April  2013)
                  showing profit from self-employment of �6745.
             iii) Tax calculation for 2013-14  (year  ended  5  April  2014)
                  showing pay from all employments as �1287 and profit  from
                  land and property of �1860.


         6. The appellant was also employed during those tax years, but her
            employment income does not count towards her exercise of Treaty
            Rights until after 1st January 2014.

         7. The letter from HMRC dated 12th May  2016  does  no  more  than
            state that she was registered self-employed. It is not evidence
            that she was earning an income as a self-employed person during
            those years. The tax calculation for the  year  ended  5  April
            2013 is adequate evidence  to  find  that  she  was  exercising
            Treaty Rights during that year up to 5 April 2013.

         8. Mr Hawkin submitted that during the year ended 5 April 2014 the
            phrase "profit from land and property" was the phrase  used  to
            denote  earnings  from  self-employment.  He  did  not  produce
            anything to substantiate that. In this case however whether  it
            is the same or not has no impact on the outcome of the  appeal.
            If a person is self-employed they will keep detailed records of
            their income and expenditure to fill in a tax return to  ensure
            a correct tax calculation is undertaken; these records were not
            produced. There was no evidence from Ms Boland when that income
            was earned, what it was for or whether it  was  earned  in  the
            latter part of the calendar year 2013.

         9. I was not directed to caselaw that considered the  question  of
            self-employment and whether there was a minimum required income
            level for a period of work. The cases Mr Hawkin relied upon all
            consider the issue  of  part-time  employment.  In  considering
            whether such part-time  employment  is  marginal  such  that  a
            person is  not  considered  to  be  exercising  Treaty  Rights,
            matters such as holiday leave, sickness pay,  pension  accrual,
            and the type of job were all material considerations as well as
            how many hours were worked and the hourly rate of pay. In  this
            case there is no evidence provided of the nature of  the  self-
            employment undertaken prior to 1st January  2014  or  what  the
            income was during that period.  Although  the  bank  statements
            show some cash payments in, there is no information what  those
            cash payments were for or where they came from. I do not  agree
            that the concept of marginal activity can be readily transposed
            to self-employed earnings given the other matters that have  to
            be considered in considering employment. Whilst  Mr  Hawkin  is
            correct that earnings do not have to be large and only must  be
            more than marginal, it cannot be said that �1860 over  the  tax
            year 2013/2014 is more than marginal - it is less than �36  per
            week at a time when the national  minimum  wage  was  �6.31  so
            would equate with about 5 � hours work per week. In the absence
            of further information, it cannot be concluded that  her  self-
            employment was anything more than marginal.


        10. Mr Hawkin submitted that  although  there  was  no  justiciable
            human rights claim (see Amirteymour), JK v secretary  of  State
            for Work and Pensions (SPC) [2017] UKUT 179 (AAC)  was  support
            for the proposition that there was a  category  of  exceptional
            cases where proportionality can come  into  play.  JK  in  turn
            refers to Mirga v Secretary of  State  for  Work  and  Pensions
            [2016] UKSC 1 which in turn explains the effect of  Baumbast  v
            SSHD C-413/99 as follows:

                  The effect of the decision in Baumbast is  that  the  fact
                 that an applicant may fall short of the strict requirements
                 of having 'self-sufficiency' status under what are now  the
                 2004  Directive  and  the  EEA  regulations  cannot  always
                 justify the host Member State automatically  rejecting  his
                 or her rights to reside on the ground that the requirements
                 for status are not wholly complied with.  In  Baumbast  the
                 court was concerned, inter alia, with the issue whether  an
                 applicant could exercise the right to reside in the  UK  in
                 circumstances where he was resting his case on  the  ground
                 that he was a 'self-sufficient person'. It  is  clear  from
                 paragraphs 88 and 89 of the judgment that the applicant had
                 sufficient resources to be self-sufficient in practice, and
                 that he had medical insurance. his  only  possible  problem
                 was that the insurance  may  have  fallen  short  of  being
                 'comprehensive' in one respect,  namely  that  it  was  not
                 clear whether it covered 'emergency treatment'.  The  court
                 held that, on the assumption that the insurance fell  short
                 in   this   connection,    it    would    nonetheless    be
                 disproportionate to deprive the applicant of the  right  to
                 reside.


                  In paragraph 92 the court  pointed  out  that  there  were
                 strong factors in the applicant's favour,  namely  that  he
                 had sufficient resources, that he had worked and resided in
                 the UK for several years, that his family had also  resided
                 in the UK for several years, that he  and  his  family  had
                 never received any social assistance, and that he  and  his
                 family had comprehensive medical insurance in  Germany.  In
                 those circumstances, the court said at paragraph 93 that it
                 would  be  'a  disproportionate   interference   with   the
                 exercise' of the appellant's right of  residence  conferred
                 by what is now Article 21.1 of TFEU to refuse  to  let  him
                 stay in  the  UK  because  of  a  small  shortfall  in  the
                 comprehensiveness of his medical insurance".

        11. In JK the SSHD  accepted  that  the  claimant's  son  had  been
            residing continuously in the UK for 10 years by  the  time  the
            claimant (his mother)  claimed  pension  credit,  that  he  was
            working legally, when he was actually working, before  Poland's
            accession, that he intended to work legally after accession and
            that he strove to avoid a period of illegal work after his visa
            expired. The SSHD accepted that the claimant's son had acquired
            permanent residence by the time his fifth job expired in  April
            2011. Mr Hawkin submitted that in this case, the appellant  had
            been in the UK for nearly 19 years, more than  half  her  life,
            she was in employment, two of her  children  were  British  and
            that although not registered to work prior to 1st January  2014
            she had worked. There was, he submitted, no evidence  of  wrong
            doing, there were no adverse public  interest  matters  and  in
            January 2019 she would in any event be  entitled  to  permanent
            residence which were all factors under EU law.


        12. From the evidence produced it  is  difficult  to  see  how  the
            appellant can be described as self-sufficient in the period  up
            to 1st January 2014, other than for the year 2012/13,  even  if
            her income from employment is taken  into  account;  employment
            that she should not have undertaken without  registration.  The
            Directive clearly states that enjoyment of Permanent  Residence
            is key to social cohesion and  Union  citizenship  and  that  a
            right of permanent  residence  will  be  granted  if  there  is
            compliance with the  conditions  laid  down  for  a  continuous
            period  of  five  years.  This  appellant's   application   for
            permanent residence was refused on 3rd January  2017  at  which
            time she had to remain exercising Treaty Rights for  a  further
            two years before becoming  eligible  for  Permanent  Residence.
            Although of course I take the decision on the facts as they are
            today, the only reason that she has in  effect  almost  accrued
            those two years is because she has pursued her appeal rights. I
            do not  say  here  that  she  should  not  have  done  so;  the
            submissions made in connection with  her  self-employment  were
            plainly submissions that were arguable. But  in  terms  of  the
            proportionality  of  the  decision  to  refuse  her   permanent
            residence, I cannot  accept  that  it  is  disproportionate  to
            refuse her permanent residence when the evidence that  she  was
            self-sufficient up to 1st January 2014 is not there; she is not
            being required to leave the UK; she continues to work and it is
            accepted that she is exercising Treaty Rights.


        13. For these reasons I find  that  the  appellant  was  not  self-
            employed in the period leading up to 1st January 2014  such  as
            to be exercising Treaty Rights. I find  that  the  decision  to
            refuse her Permanent Residence is not disproportionate.

            Conclusion


            The First-tier Tribunal materially erred in law and I set aside
            the decision to be remade.


            I remake the decision and dismiss the appeal.

        Upper Tribunal Judge Coker
-----------------------
            [1] The appellant's representatives wrote to  the  Tribunal  as
            directed and said that the appellant's documents had been  sent
            to the Presenting Officers Unit and to the First-tier  Tribunal
            on 16th March. Although  date  stamped  by  the  Tribunal,  the
            solicitors state they were informed by the administration in  a
            telephone call they  made  after  receiving  my  Error  of  Law
            decision, that the documents had been received  on  21st  March
            but entered "on the system" on 22nd March. The letter from  the
            solicitors does  not  explain  why  they  failed  to  file  the
            documents in accordance with  the  written  directions  of  the
            Tribunal but rather relied upon what they say they were told by
            a member of the administrative staff. I do not propose to  take
            this  matter  any  further  but  assume  that  in  future   the
            solicitors will comply with  the  directions  of  the  Tribunal
            rather than telephone conversations with administrative staff.
