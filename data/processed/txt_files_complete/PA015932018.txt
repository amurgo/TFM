                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant appeals against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Tobin dated 28 March 2018.  The Appellant  is  a  national  of
    Albania.

2.   The Appellant arrived in the UK clandestinely on  1  October  2014  and
    claimed asylum  the  same  day.  She  gave  an  account  that  she  was
    originally from [B] in the Mat District.  There,  she  entered  into  a
    relationship with a man called [A] which was kept a  secret  from  both
    their families. [A] spent much of his time outside Albania, working  in
    Greece. The relationship became known when she  became  pregnant.  Both
    families disapproved of the relationship but her family forced  her  to
    go to live with [A]'s family.  They initially  rejected  her  and  only
    took her in when [A] appeared and accepted that she was  pregnant  with
    his child. Although the couple married,  the  relationship  broke  down
    shortly after, as [A]'s family did not want her to remain  living  with
    them.

3.   The Appellant stated that she gave birth to her son in  June  2010  and
    moved to Tirana in around October 2010.   Her  account  thereafter  was
    that she worked in a caf� and  rented  an  apartment  in  Tirana.   She
    stated that she met a man [E] who after a period of time entered into a
    relationship with her.  They commenced cohabiting in or around  January
    2012 and after three months  he  forced  her  into  prostitution.   She
    remained in captivity in Albania for a prolonged period of time  before
    her son, who suffers from autism, fell ill  and  had  to  be  taken  to
    hospital.  The Appellant escaped from those whom had held  her  captive
    from that hospital.  She  obtained  the  assistance  of  a  friend  and
    approximately two weeks later left  Albania  with  her  son  travelling
    clandestinely to the United Kingdom where she claimed asylum.

4.   The Respondent rejected her claim for asylum and found  also  that  she
    was not a victim of trafficking.  The Respondent did however observe as
    follows in relation to the summary account  I  have  given  above.   At
    [39], the Respondent states that:

         "39. ... During your  asylum  interview  you  provided  a  detailed
             account of the problems you encountered with your husband, his
             family and your family during your relationship.

         40.  Due to a lack of supporting evidence it has not been  possible
             to substantiate this aspect of your claim  consideration  will
             therefore be given as to whether to give you  the  benefit  of
             the doubt."

5.   In the body of  the  refusal  letter  dealing  with  issues  of  forced
    prostitution the Respondent stated as follows at [43]:

         "It is considered that you were able to provide a reasonable  level
         of detail regarding your time in the house."

6.   At [49]-[50] the Respondent  considers  the  application  of  paragraph
    339L of the Immigration Rules regarding the benefit of  the  doubt  and
    finds at [51] that the  problems  with  the  Appellant's  husband  were
    accepted.  However, at [52], the issues  of  forced  prostitution  were
    not.

7.   The Appellant appealed and the matter came before the judge on 2  March
    2018.  The Appellant gave  evidence  and  also  before  the  judge  was
    documentary evidence regarding the Appellant's son's health.

8.   The judge held as follows, in summary:

      i) At [28], in relation to a country expert report:

             "Dr Korovilas was not available to  give  evidence  or  answer
             questions in respect of his report.  The weight that I  attach
             to this report was further diminished  by  the  absence  of  a
             letter of instructions nor details of his fee arrangements  so
             that I could not assess the full veracity of  the  Appellant's
             professional  witnesses  input.   I  was  concerned  that   Dr
             Korovilas' report appeared to  have  strayed  into  evaluating
             evidence and otherwise giving his views on the credibility  of
             the Appellant's evidence of fact.   Dr  Korovilas  dealt  with
             matters that should be properly be determined by the judge  in
             this case.  With these  reservations  in  mind,  I  accept  Mr
             Ogbewe's  submission  that  this  called  into  question   the
             objectivity of his report and I was not particularly  assisted
             by this evidence."

     ii) At [29] the judge held as follows:

             "The Appellant's account of being trafficked was  not  at  all
             credible  or  convincing.   Although  I  exercise  caution  in
             assessing the Appellant's demeanour and the  manner  in  which
             she answered questions, I found the weight  she  presented  as
             lacking any credibility.  Notwithstanding  making  significant
             allowances for the fact that she might be telling the truth in
             respect  of  her  horrific  chain  of  events  the   Appellant
             nevertheless   appeared   evasive   and   her   answers   were
             unconvincing.  The  Appellant  spoke  over  the  translator  a
             number of  times  and  did  not  answer  the  questions.   She
             continuously  interrupted  the  translator  which  meant  that
             questions needed to be put to the Appellant a number of  times
             to solicit  the  answer  to  the  questions.   We  spent  some
             considerable time trying to ascertain when the Appellant first
             met [E] and where she was working at that  time.   I  was  not
             able  to  get  a  consistent  answer  to  that  point  in  the
             chronology although the Appellant settled on the response said
             that she was working in [K F] as a waitress when she met [E]."

    iii) The judge also took issue at [30] that the Appellant was  not  able
         to give a specific address for the caf�.

     iv) The judge held at [31] that it was implausible that [E] would  have
         taken a considerable  period  of  time  (six  months)  fostering  a
         relationship with her and then a further  three  months  cohabiting
         with her before entering her into forced prostitution.

      v) It was not plausible  that  the  Appellant  would  have  been  left
         unaccompanied with money at the hospital  allowing  her  to  escape
         [32]-[33].

     vi) It was implausible that the Appellant would have left a significant
         amount of money from her own savings with a neighbour which she was
         able to utilise to facilitate her exit from Albania [35].

    vii) Certain details of her arrival in the UK and  her  approaching  the
         Home Office at Croydon were implausible [36].

   viii) At [37] the judge  referred  to  a  perceived  discrepancy  in  the
         Appellant's evidence:

             "37. In evidence the Appellant said that her life would be  in
             danger if she returned to Albania.  She said [E] and his thugs
             would find her.  She said that they were  connected  with  the
             state which appeared to be a change of her evidence as in  her
             previous account as she said that [E] and his associates would
             be able to trace  her  through  their  association  with  some
             police officers who used/abused prostitutes."

     ix) Accepting the part of the Appellant's story in which she  had  said
         she had problems with her husband and his family the judge did  not
         accept the Appellant's evidence of a lack of contact with  her  own
         family; the judge did not believe the Appellant's account that  she
         had nothing to do with her family following her  marriage;  it  was
         unlikely that they would turn their back on their daughter  with  a
         small child particularly one with special needs [38].

      x) At [41] the judge found that he was  profoundly  dissatisfied  with
         the Appellant's account.  She did not appear at all  credible  when
         answering questions.  The appeal was dismissed.

9.   The Appellant appeals on grounds dated 10 April  2018  which  argue  in
    summary that the judge materially erred in law  in  (ignoring  a  point
    made about whether the decision should have been anonymised):

      1) failing to have any or  adequate  regard  to  the  expert  evidence
         before him, in particular on the issue of the plausibility  of  the
         Appellant's account of being groomed in Albania;

      2)  in  placing  undue  weight  on  the  perceived  demeanour  of  the
         Appellant;

      3)  having  regard  to  a  purported  discrepancy  when  no   material
         discrepancy was apparent from the face of the Appellant's evidence;

      4) going behind the concession made by the Respondent in the  decision
         letter that the Appellant had had the problems with her own  family
         which she had set out in SEF interview;

      5) failing to have adequate  regard  to  the  medical  evidence  which
         related to her son's autism.

10.  Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Haria in a decision dated 23 April 2018.  The relevant  parts  of  that
    decision are as follows:

         "5.  The weight to be given to any evidence is  a  matter  for  the
             judge.  The judge gives adequate reasons at  paragraph  25  of
             the determination for the weight given to  the  report  of  Dr
             Korovilas.

         6.   It is arguable that the judge made an error of law material to
             the decision in:

               a) The over reliance on the demeanour of the  Appellant  when
                  assessing her credibility,

               b) in going behind a concession made by the Respondent and

               c) in the findings as to the Appellant's son's autism in  the
                  light of the evidence particularly the letter  from  Alder
                  Hey  Children's  Hospital  dated  4  November  2015,  (the
                  Appellant's bundle pages 152 -154) and the letter from his
                  school dated 6 February 2018 (the Appellant's bundle  page
                  200).

11.  Before me an issue arose between the parties as to the  scope  of  that
    grant of permission to appeal.  For his part  Mr  Schwenk  argued  that
    permission had been granted generally as was apparent on the header  of
    the grant of permission to appeal itself.  I also pointed out  to  both
    parties that the letter issued by the First-tier Tribunal  in  granting
    permission to appeal stated merely that permission  had  been  granted.
    There was no advice given  on  the  letter  issued  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal suggesting to the Appellant that permission had  been  granted
    only on partial  grounds.   If  that  had  been  the  manner  in  which
    permission had been granted, I find that it would have been appropriate
    for the First-tier Tribunal to have stated on the face of  that  letter
    that the Appellant had the opportunity of renewing an  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  on  the  grounds  on  which
    permission had not been granted.

12.  For his part Mr Tan argued that permission had  been  granted  only  on
    the limited grounds as set out in the  decision  of  Judge  Haria,  and
    although it would have been preferable for the  letter  issued  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal to have informed the Appellant  that  she  had  the
    opportunity of making a renewed application for permission  to  appeal,
    and it would have been  preferable  for  Judge  Haria  to  have  stated
    specifically on the face of the grant of permission that it  was  being
    granted only on partial grounds these were procedural matters which did
    not alter the clear meaning of the terms in which Judge  Haria  granted
    permission to appeal.

13.  I find in favour of the Appellant in this matter which is that I  treat
    permission  to  appeal  being  granted  on  all  grounds.   This  is  a
    consequence of permission being granted generally on the header of that
    grant of permission and as I have  observed  above  the  Appellant  not
    having been advised that the grant of permission was on partial grounds
    only and that she had an opportunity to make a renewed application.  My
    interpretation of that grant of permission  is,  I  find,  entirely  in
    accordance with the guidance given by the Upper Tribunal in the case of
    Ferrer (limited appeal grounds; Alvi) [2012] UKUT 00304.

14.  I therefore deal with all  of  the  substantive  grounds.   During  the
    parties' submissions, I indicated that I did not need to hear  from  Mr
    Schwenk initially but rather turned to Mr Tan for his  observations  on
    the Appellant's grounds.

15.  Mr Tan at my suggestion focused principally on the issues  of  (i)  the
    weight that had been attached to the expert report  by  the  judge  and
    (ii) the issue of the judge's approach to demeanour of  the  Appellant.
    Mr Tan defended the judge's approach to the  expert  report  suggesting
    that the expert had strayed into evaluating evidence in such  a  manner
    that called into question his objectivity in his report. In  particular
    Mr Tan referred to passages at pages 10 to 12 of the expert  report  on
    "the implementation of  TIMS  system  in  Albania",  where  the  expert
    considers the reliability of the border recording system  operative  in
    Albania which records entries and exits to that  country.   The  expert
    had concluded as follows at page 12:

         "My conclusion on this point is that  since  Albania/Kosovo  border
         (sic) this is a busy border crossing, it is perfectly reasonable to
         assume that the border control staff did not notice that  a  person
         who is not (the Appellant)  has  crossed  this  border  using  (the
         Appellant's)  passport.   Therefore,  the  fact  that  TIMS  system
         recorded (the Appellant) entering Kosovo on 13 July 2014 cannot  be
         taken as evidence which is in contradiction  to  (the  Appellant's)
         statement concerning her movements."

16.  Mr Tan suggested that this was a matter which essentially  representing
    the expert going on a frolic of his own and speculating  about  certain
    matters which were outside of the Appellant's own asserted evidence.

17.  However, I find that the issue  of  the  Appellant  being  recorded  or
    apparently recorded leaving Albania at  the  Morine  land  border  into
    Kosovo is an issue directly raised in the decision letter at  [47]  and
    therefore was a matter on which the expert would have been entitled  to
    comment.

18.  I accept that it certainly would been preferable  for  a  copy  of  the
    letter of instruction to the expert to have been included in the appeal
    bundle.  However, otherwise, I find that the judge's  finding  at  [28]
    that the expert had strayed into evaluating the evidence and  otherwise
    giving his views on the credibility of the Appellant's evidence, was  a
    finding which was not open to the judge  on  the  evidence  within  the
    expert report.

19.  I have read the entirety of the report and I cannot  see  any  instance
    of the expert purporting to comment on whether the Appellant's  account
    was "credible" or otherwise.  I find that the expert  was  entitled  to
    comment, for example at page 7, whether the Appellant's account of  how
    she was trafficked into prostitution was consistent with the pattern of
    prostitution and trafficking involving criminal gangs, and setting out,
    as he did, as follows:

         "Ms Meta's account of how she was essentially tricked into  working
         as a prostitute is entirely consistent with my understanding of how
         human trafficking and sexual exploitation networks operate,  it  is
         also consistent with  the  objective  evidence  on  Albanian  human
         trafficking networks."

    The expert gives a footnote at that point of his report to the  concept
    that human trafficking includes the process of  moving  a  person  from
    their normal into a life of slavery or sexual exploitation.

20.  The expert also commented in the next paragraph that:

         "The prevalence of human trafficking  in  Albania  has  made  young
         woman (sic) very suspicious, therefore human  trafficking  networks
         are increasingly turning to the more subtle technique of recruiting
         women by pretending to form a relationship with them or by offering
         them what appears to  be  legitimate  paid  employment...therefore,
         (the Appellant's) account of how she befriended by [E],  under  the
         guise  of  forming  a  relationship,  before  being  'tricked'  and
         'forced'  into  prostitution,  is  entirely  consistent  with   the
         objective evidence  on  how  Albanian  human  trafficking  networks
         operate."

    There is then a footnote  to  "Albanian  entrepreneurial  practices  in
    human smuggling and trafficking: on the road to the United Kingdom  via
    Brussels, 1995 - 2005, Johann Leman and Stef Janssens.

21.  I find that the expert has merely done that which is expected  of  him;
    to provide an opinion as to whether a particular account is  consistent
    or not consistent with the country information concerning a  particular
    phenomenon in a country of origin. He does nothing  more  or  less.   I
    find that the judge was not entitled to  treat  the  expert  report  as
    deserving of only little weight,  and  to  find  that  the  expert  had
    demonstrated a lack of objectivity in his report.

22.  This then leads into the specific argument set out at  paragraph  8  of
    the grounds of appeal which is that the judge failed  to  have  any  or
    adequate regard to the passage within the  expert's  report  about  the
    phenomenon of grooming and trafficking gangs enticing potential victims
    of trafficking into relationships.   This  is  precisely  the  scenario
    which the Appellant had set out in her evidence and the expert evidence
    on that issue was clearly directly relevant to the credibility  of  the
    Appellant's account.  I find the judge erroneously left out of  account
    the expert evidence on that matter.  I find that this is a  significant
    error of law.

23.  The next matter complained of in the Appellant's grounds of  appeal  is
    the judge's over reliance on demeanour.   I  have  set  out  above  the
    passed in the judge' decision in  which  he  deals  with  that  matter.
    However I have drawn to the parties' attention today the reported  case
    of KB and AH (credibility - structured approach: Pakistan) [2017]  UKUT
    491 in which the Honourable Lord Burns and Dr Storey held as follows at
    paragraph 33:

         "Second, such indicators are not to be taken as an exhaustive list:
         for example the list given in the Home Office Instruction does  not
         include demeanour.  In our view that is consistent with established
         case law which considers that in asylum appeals it will  be  rarely
         stated to attach significant weight to demeanour as a  factor  (see
         e.g. B v SSHD (Democratic Republic of  Congo)  [2003]  UKIAT  00014
         paragraph 10: 'Judging demeanour across cultural divides is fraught
         with danger'); indeed, we shall mention below what we made  of  the
         demeanour of the first Appellant.  On the other  hand,  we  do  not
         think  it  possible  to  exclude  that  in  certain   circumstances
         demeanour may be relevant."

24.  The Tribunal in KB and AH then go on to state as follows  at  paragraph
    50:

         "We alluded earlier to  the  possible  relevance  of  demeanour  in
         assessment of credibility and stated argue that it would be  rarely
         if ever be  of  importance  in  asylum  appeals.   Illustrative  of
         perhaps of why, it was our own reaction to  the  first  Appellant's
         evidence that throughout he seemed  uncomfortable  and  not  always
         able to give answers to the specific questions being asked  of  him
         (a number of  questions  had  to  be  repeated  for  that  reason).
         However viewing the evidence as a whole, we bore in  mind  that  we
         were receiving his evidence through an interpreter and  that  these
         features of his oral testimony were as  likely  to  be  personality
         traits not connected  to  matters  going  to  credence.   Hence  we
         decided to attach little negative weight to such short comings."

25.  I find that all of the Appellant's evidence ought to  have  been  taken
    into account in the round, in addition to the apparent manner in  which
    she gave evidence before the judge.  For  example,  it  appears  to  me
    (without binding any future Tribunal), that the Appellant's account  as
    set out in the SEF interview of 21 April 2015 was a long  but  coherent
    narrative which for the most part was set out in  large  extracts,  for
    example question 43, question 63 and question 180, where the  Appellant
    gave a clear account,  uninterrupted  by  additional  or  supplementary
    questions  from  the  interviewing  officer.  Although  this  therefore
    appears to be in contrast to the way in which she appears to have given
    evidence before the Judge, the fact that the Appellant was  capable  of
    giving a clear and coherent account in her SEF  interview  should  have
    been taken into account by the Judge.  It is likely  that  it  was  the
    manner in which she gave  her  evidence  in  the  SEF  interview  which
    resulted in the Respondent describing those parts of  her  evidence  as
    representing a detailed account (refusal, at [39] and [43])

26.  I find in the light of the guidance given by the Upper Tribunal in  the
    case of KB and AH that the judge materially erred in  law  in  treating
    the demeanour of the Appellant when giving evidence before him as being
    a significant matter.  It is clear that the  judge  placed  significant
    weight on the perceived demeanour of  the  Appellant  when  giving  her
    evidence.

27.  I also find that the judge was  not  entitled  at  [37]  to  treat  the
    Appellant's evidence  as  containing  a  material  discrepancy,  having
    suggested that [E] had connections with the state, whereas she had also
    made reference to police officers attending as  clients  at  the  house
    where the prostitutes  provided  their  services.  Police  are  clearly
    representatives of the state. There was no discrepancy.

28.  It is notable that the judge did not make any findings  as  to  whether
    effective protection or internal flight was available to the Appellant,
    and so the above mentioned flaws in the assessment of  the  Appellant's
    credibility were crucial to the outcome of the appeal.

29.  As a result of the above matters, I  find  that  the  judge  materially
    erred in law in his assessment of the credibility  of  the  Appellant's
    account.  I have not found it necessary to determine  grounds  (4)  and
    (5) as set out  in  my  paragraph  [10]  above.  The  severity  of  the
    Appellant's son's autism will be a matter to be considered by the First-
    tier, upon remittal of this appeal,  which  is  necessary  due  to  the
    extent of findings of fact which need to be made  in  relation  to  the
    appeal.

    Notice of Decision

    The making of the decision involved the making of  material  errors  of
    law.

    I set aside the judge's decision.

    I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

The appeal concerns  a  protection  claim  and  makes  reference  to  sexual
exploitation of the Appellant. Unless and until a Tribunal or court  directs
otherwise,  the  Appellant  is  granted  anonymity.   No  report  of   these
proceedings shall directly or indirectly  identify  him  or  any  member  of
their family.  This direction applies both  to  the  Appellant  and  to  the
Respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction could  lead  to  contempt
of court proceedings.
