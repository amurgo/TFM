Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms S. Bassiri-Dezfouli, counsel instructed by BWF
solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S. Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                             DECISION & REASONS

    1.   The appeal came before the writer on 13 June 2016,  when  I  found
         that First tier Tribunal Judge Monson had erred materially  in  law
         in dismissing the appeal and I adjourned the appeal to be heard  at
         a resumed hearing on the following  issues:  (i)  the  question  of
         whether or not it is reasonable to  expect  the  Appellant's  three
         British children to leave the  United  Kingdom  [EX1(a)(ii)];  (ii)
         whether or not there are insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life
         continuing in Ghana [EX1(b)] and (iii) the proportionality  of  the
         removal of the Appellant to Ghana, it  having  been  accepted  that
         family life has been established in the UK. A copy of that decision
         is appended.

    Hearing

    2.   At the resumed hearing, no further evidence was relied upon except
         for a short letter from the Appellant's partner,  Benaifer  Okyere,
         dated 1 June 2016.

    3.   The Appellant gave evidence and adopted his statement of  26.6.15.
         He was asked some supplementary questions by Ms S. Bassiri-Dezfouli
         in respect of his eldest daughter, J1. He said that  his  wife  had
         last travelled to Ghana in 2007 to visit her  grandmother  for  two
         weeks and had travelled on her  own,  whilst  he  cared  for  their
         daughter. He said that neither he nor his partner had any relatives
         remaining in Ghana as his mother had died 2 years ago;  his  father
         died in 2001 and his partner's grandmother had died last  year.  He
         does have relatives in the United Kingdom viz his brother  and  two
         sisters and his partner's parents and brother also  live  here.  He
         did not have any relatives left in Ghana. In cross-examination,  he
         stated that his wife's grandmother was from Kumasi and that he  had
         grown up in Accra. In terms of extended family, he  said  that  his
         mother had lost her parents when she was very young and, whilst his
         father probably had siblings too, he died when the  Appellant  left
         Ghana and he did not have any cousins that he  could  remember.  He
         confirmed that his partner was aware that he did not have any  form
         of immigration status when they had their children. He said that it
         would be very difficult for them to go  back  as  a  family  or  to
         separate. He said that he had finished secondary  school  in  Ghana
         and came to the United Kingdom when he was 23 and in between he had
         worked at a printing house press. He said, when  asked  whether  he
         had looked into the education system in  Ghana  for  his  daughter,
         that it would be very difficult to get them into  school.  He  said
         that his brother does give him occasional financial support of  �10
         or �20.

    4.   The Appellant's partner,  Benaifer  Okyere,  was  called  to  give
         evidence and adopted the letter she had  written  herself  dated  1
         June 2016. She was asked for examples of times when her partner had
         stood by her and she said that she had had  a  miscarriage  in  the
         sense she lost a baby who was born a week late and whilst  she  had
         been born alive she died straight away. She  confirmed  that  there
         was a birth certificate for that child in the bundle. She said that
         her partner was there throughout and supportive,  and  without  him
         she did not know what she  would  have  done.  She  said  that  her
         partner looked after their eldest daughter, and did the school  run
         and school activities, and had looked after the girls when she  was
         in hospital for a week when she had their most  recent  child.  She
         said that their eldest daughter had never travelled outside the UK.
         She confirmed that since she came to the UK she had  visited  Ghana
         on two occasions, most recently in 2007 when she went to visit  her
         grandmother and that she had stayed at her grandmother's house  for
         2 weeks and that her grandmother had passed away  last  year.  When
         asked what problems she would have if she were to go back to  Ghana
         with her partner and three children she responded that her life  is
         based here, her family is here and she  would  not  know  where  to
         start. It would not be easy on the kids.

    5.   The Appellant's partner was briefly cross-examined by Mr  Whitwell
         when she stated that she had come to the UK from Ghana in  1997  at
         the age of 14 years and that she  had  been  born  in  Kumasi.  She
         confirmed that her eldest daughter would be due to start her  GCSEs
         in Year 11 and she was just about to complete Year 7. She said that
         her partner had a brother and sisters in this country and  he  lost
         his mother two years ago. His father passed away by  the  time  she
         met him.  When  asked  what  she  would  do  if,  the  appeal  were
         unsuccessful, she said that it would be very difficult for  her  to
         go to work because her partner looks after the children  and  that,
         when asked if she would move to Ghana, that  the  family  would  be
         split because she could not go to  Ghana  to  live  there  and  her
         partner did not have any family there; so it would be difficult for
         them to go there with the children. She confirmed that  she  worked
         but was currently on maternity leave.

    6.   In her submissions, Ms Bassiri-Dezfouli submitted that it was  not
         reasonable for the Appellant, his partner and three children to  go
         back (to Ghana). The  two  youngest  children  are  young  but  are
         British children born in the UK. The eldest child was aged 12 and a
         half years. She has spent over seven years since the age of four in
         the UK and has not travelled out of the UK. She did  not  accompany
         her mother to Ghana. She drew my attention to  photographs  of  the
         couple with their eldest child and submitted that he  had  been  in
         her life since the beginning. She submitted  that  the  Appellant's
         partner's answers were clear that the family would have to split up
         because she would be unable to go back to Ghana and that  this  had
         not been considered fully by the Respondent.

    7.   The Appellant's partner came to the UK at the age of  14  and  has
         lived in the UK since then. She last visited Ghana in 2007 and both
         appellants, if believed, have no relatives in Ghana, nor anyone  to
         go back to. Ms Bassiri-Dezfouli drew our attention to the fact that
         the Appellant's eldest daughter was very close to her cousin in the
         UK. She submitted that there would clearly be a breakdown in  terms
         of family life and taking all  that  into  consideration  the  test
         would be met. As far as insurmountable obstacles are  concerned  it
         would be almost impossible for them to  continue  their  life.  The
         Appellant was in Ghana until the age of 23 but he came  to  the  UK
         about 15 years ago and has spent most of his adulthood  in  the  UK
         and has lost all contact and ties with Ghana. It  was  unreasonable
         to expect him to go back and would be disproportionate.

    8.   In his submissions, Mr  Whitwell  acknowledged  that  the  refusal
         letter of 17 December 2014 at  [20]  and  [12]  accepted  that  the
         Appellant met the  suitability  and  relationship  requirements  of
         appendix FM to the Rules. In respect of paragraph  EX1(b)  and  the
         question of insurmountable obstacles he sought to rely  on  Agyarko
         [2015] EWCA Civ 440 at [21] [22] [25] and submitted  that,  on  the
         facts of this particular case, taking out the issue of  nationality
         and the Appellant's partner's job and length  of  residence,  there
         was  nothing  to  overcome  that  hurdle.  He  submitted  that  the
         Appellant had been educated in Ghana and had a limited  educational
         history, and that his partner had lived in Ghana until the  age  of
         14 and the appeal cannot succeed under EX1(b).

    9.   The refusal letter had also accepted that there is a  genuine  and
         subsisting relationship between the parties, and  the  question  is
         whether it was reasonable to  expect  them  to  leave  the  UK.  Mr
         Whitwell relied in this respect of the judgment  in  MA  (Pakistan)
         [2016] EWCA Civ 705 and submitted that it was necessary to consider
         the Appellant's lack of immigration status,  which  weighs  against
         him  in  terms  of  reasonableness,  given  that  he  was   present
         unlawfully from 19 December 2003 until 5  December  2013  and  that
         family life was formed during this period of precarious status  cf.
         Rajendran [2016] UKUT 00138 (IAC) at [38] and [39] and his  partner
         was aware of his lack of status.

    10.  In respect of the eldest child, Mr  Whitwell  submitted  that  her
         education was not yet at a point where she is taking GCSEs, and  so
         would not be prejudiced, and  that  the  family  in  the  UK  would
         provide  financial  assistance   to   assist   the   Appellant   in
         establishing  himself  in  Ghana.  He  concluded  by  stating  that
         Ghanaian society was not an alien culture because the Appellant had
         been born and brought up and has an employment  history  there.  Mr
         Whitwell further submitted that Article 8 would stand or fall  with
         the decision under the Immigration Rules.

    11.  Ms S. Bassiri-Dezfouli briefly replied, concluding that the matter
         came down to the fact that there would be a split  in  family  life
         and the question is whether this would be reasonable.

    Our findings and conclusions

    12.  We find the evidence of the Appellant and his partner credible and
         consistent. Indeed, Mr Whitwell  did  not  seek  to  challenge  it.
         Consequently, we proceed on the basis that if the Appellant were to
         be removed to Ghana, this decision would split his  family  because
         his partner and three children would remain in the United  Kingdom.
         We further accept the  evidence  of  both  the  Appellant  and  his
         partner that there are no relatives or people to  whom  they  could
         turn  for  support  and  assistance  in  finding   employment   and
         reintegration in Ghana, due to the long absence of both  from  that
         country.

    13.  In the refusal letter of 17 December 2014, the Respondent at  [12]
         accepted that the Appellant met the  suitability  requirements  for
         limited leave to remain as a partner or parent  under  E-LTRP  1.2-
         1.12 or E-LTRPT 2.2.-2.4. and at [20] that he met  the  eligibility
         requirements for leave to remain as a partner under E-LTRP  1.2-.12
         and 2.1. Consideration was then given to EX1(b) at [33] and at [34]-
         [38] the Respondent concluded that  there  were  no  insurmountable
         obstacles to family life continuing in Ghana. Notably, there was no
         consideration of EX1(a), on which alternative basis  the  Appellant
         would be entitled to succeed, whatever the  conclusion  reached  on
         (b).

    14.  EX.1. provides:

             This paragraph applies if

             (a)  (i) the applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  parental
                  relationship with a child who-

                  (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was under the age of
                      18 years when the applicant was first  granted  leave
                      on the basis that this paragraph applied;

                  (bb) is in the UK;

                  (cc)  is  a  British  Citizen  or  has  lived  in  the  UK
                      continuously for at least  the  7  years  immediately
                      preceding the date of application; and

                  (ii) it would not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to
                  leave the UK.

    15.  It is not disputed that the Appellant has a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship  with  his  three  children,  who  were  born
         respectively on 19 December 2003, 22 October 2014  and  2  November
         2015 and are thus all under the age of 18 and are British by virtue
         of the fact that their mother is  a  naturalized  British  citizen.
         Thus the issue is whether it would  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
         children to leave the United Kingdom. The two youngest children are
         both under 2 years of age and we find that, given  their  ages,  it
         would be in  their  best  interests  to  live  with  their  mother,
         wherever she is.

    16.  It might not be unreasonable to expect  the  mother  of  two  such
         young children to move to another country, if  she  chose  to  stay
         with their  father.  However,  as  the  parties  acknowledged,  the
         material question is whether  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  their
         eldest child, J1 to leave the United Kingdom. J1 is now  12  and  a
         half years of age and from the evidence we heard, lives the  normal
         life of a British child of that age: attending school;  socializing
         with her  cousin  and  friends  and  pursuing  sporting  and  other
         activities. She was born in and has never left the United Kingdom.

    17.  We have considered the authorities drawn to our  attention  by  Mr
         Whitwell. In MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705 the Court of  Appeal
         (Elias LJ) considered the issue of whether it is reasonable in  the
         public interest to remove a child from the UK once  s/he  has  been
         resident for seven years, in the context of article 8 consideration
         under section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
         2002. However,  in  this  case  the  Respondent  accepts  that  the
         Appellant meets the suitability and eligibility provisions  of  the
         Rules; so he is able to benefit from  the  exception  in  EX1  (a),
         without resorting to article 8. This is a  position  distinct  from
         the  one  dealt  with  by  section   117B(b)   where   the   entire
         consideration takes place outside the Immigration Rules. We further
         note at [44] Elias LJ's view that:

             "It seems to me that there are powerful  reasons  why,  having
             regard in particular to the need to treat the  best  interests
             of the child as a primary consideration,  it  may  be  thought
             that once they have been in the UK for  seven  years,  or  are
             otherwise citizens of the UK, they should be allowed  to  stay
             and have  their  position  legitimized  if  it  would  not  be
             reasonable to expect them to leave, even though the effect  if
             that their  possibly  undeserving  families  can  remain  with
             them."

         In respect of applying the reasonableness test, his  Lordship  held
         inter alia:

             "[46]    After such a period of time the child will  have  put
             down roots and  developed  social,  cultural  and  educational
             links in the UK such that it is likely to be highly disruptive
             if the child is required to leave the UK ...

             [47] Even where the child's best interests are to stay, it may
             still not be unreasonable to require the child to leave.  That
             will depend upon a careful analysis of the nature  and  extent
             of the links in the UK and in the country where it is proposed
             he should return. What could not be considered  however  would
             be the conduct and immigration history of the parents."

    18.  We note also the finding by a  panel  chaired  by  Blake  J,  then
         President, Mr Justice Blake in Azimi-Moayed and  others  (decisions
         affecting children; onward appeals)  [2013]  UKUT  00197  (IAC)  at
         13(iv) that "seven years  from  age  four  is  likely  to  be  more
         significant to a child that the first seven years of life."

    19.  However, in neither of those cases  were  the  Court  or  Tribunal
         concerned with a British child. In ZH (Tanzania) (FC) (Appellant) v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent) [2011] UKSC
         4, Lady Hale made clear that the best interests of the child were a
         primary  consideration  but  at  [30]-[33]   she   considered   the
         importance of British nationality  for  a  child  whose  parent  is
         facing removal. Lord Hope  held  at  [41}:  "The  fact  of  British
         citizenship does not trump everything else. But it will hardly ever
         be less than a very significant and weighty factor  against  moving
         children who have that status to another country with a parent  who
         has no right to remain here, especially if the effect of doing this
         is that they will inevitably lose those benefits and advantages for
         the rest of their childhood." Lord Kerr held at [47]  that:  "if  a
         child  is  a  British  citizen,  this  has  an  independent  value,
         freestanding of the debate in relation to best interests, and  this
         must weigh in the balance in any decision that may affect  where  a
         child will live."

    20.  J1 is a British citizen who was born, and has always  lived  here.
         She is now 12�, and has been right through primary school  in  this
         country. She is now doing well at secondary school, with  at  least
         the usual number of friends and  ambitions.  No-one  has  suggested
         that she could reasonably be parted from her mother, and we do  not
         think it could reasonably be suggested that she should be  sent  to
         live in Ghana, and we accept her  mother's  evidence  that  she  is
         strongly attached to her father. Even if we were  wrong  about  the
         effect of EX.1, and needed to take into account the public interest
         in removing her father, in view of his  immigration  history,  that
         would clearly not be in her best interests, and in  our  view  that
         public interest does not outweigh hers, on the particular facts  of
         this case.

    Decision

    21.  To summarize our conclusions, it is accepted that  this  Appellant
         meets the suitability and eligibility requirements  of  the  Rules;
         and that his 'genuine  and  subsisting  relationship'  with  J1,  a
         British child who  has  lived  here  for  well  over  seven  years,
         satisfies the requirements of EX.1 (a) (i). We have concluded  that
         she could not reasonably be expected to leave this country, and  on
         that basis the appellant's appeal is allowed under the  Immigration
         Rules.
