Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Tom Wilding, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    M M Zahir, a solicitor and Partner in, 'The Law
Avdisers'


                                  Anonymity
    The First-tier Tribunal made an anonymity order in this appeal.   I  am
    satisfied that such order shall remain in place unless the Tribunal  or
    any appropriate court directs otherwise.  As such, no report  of  these
    proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify the respondent or his
    family members.  Failure to comply with this  order  could  lead  to  a
    contempt of court.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant in this appeal is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department and to avoid confusion I shall refer to  her  throughout  as
    being "the Claimant."  The respondent is Mr AT, a  national  of  Sierra
    Leone born on 26th June, 1977.

2.   The respondent entered the  United  Kingdom  on  24th  December,  2000,
    using a stolen South African passport and  claimed  asylum.   This  was
    refused on 5th December, 2001, and he appealed on  20  December,  2001,
    but his appeal was dismissed on 3rd April, 2003.  Permission to  appeal
    was  subsequently  granted  and  dismissed  on  31st  March,  2004.   A
    subsequent application for permission to appeal was  rejected  on  25th
    June, 2004.

3.   I assume that it was on 25th June, 2004 that he  became  appeal  rights
    exhausted.

4.   The respondent  made  an  application  for  leave  to  remain  on  17th
    December, 2006, and this was rejected on 15th April,  2007,  without  a
    right of appeal (because the respondent had no leave).

5.   On 26th March, 2011, the respondent was served with a  notice  advising
    him he should leave the United Kingdom.  Further submissions were  made
    by solicitors on his behalf on 5th November, 2012 requesting  leave  to
    remain outside the Immigration Rules and for a work permit.  These were
    refused on 5th December, 2013.

6.   On 8th February, 2006  the  respondent  was  convicted  at  Bow  Street
    Magistrates' Court of possession of cannabis a class C controlled  drug
    and was fined �75.   On  25th  September,  2007  he  was  convicted  at
    Greenwich Magistrates' Court, again for possession of cannabis a  class
    C controlled drug and was again fined �75.  On 20th  January,  2014  he
    was convicted at Woolwich Crown Court  of  possession  with  intent  to
    supply a controlled drug, class B cannabis, for which he was  sentenced
    to twelve  months  imprisonment  and  ordered  to  pay  a  �100  victim
    surcharge and the cannabis was ordered to be forfeited  and  destroyed.
    The respondent was also convicted of facilitating  the  acquisition  or
    possession of criminal property, for which he was sentenced to a twelve
    month term of imprisonment to run concurrently.

7.   On 15th October, 2014 the Claimant made a deportation order in  respect
    of the respondent under Section 32 of the  UK  Border  Act  2007.   The
    respondent appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and his appeal was heard
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge Stokes at Taylor House on  20th  February,
    2015.

8.   In a determination promulgated on 30th April, 2015  the  judge  allowed
    the respondent's appeal on human rights grounds.

9.   The Claimant, dissatisfied with the decision, sought  and  was  granted
    permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Kebede.  She said:-

         "There is arguable merit in the assertion in the grounds  that  the
         judge erred in her approach to the question of 'unduly harsh'  when
         considering paragraph 399(A) of the Immigration Rules  in  relation
         to the appellant's stepchildren and that her  assessment  of  'very
         compelling circumstances'  whilst  taking  account  of  the  public
         interest, failed to give it the appropriate weight."

10.  At the hearing  before  me,  Mr  Wilding,  for  the  Claimant  drew  my
    attention to paragraphs 37 and 39 of the  determination.   It  will  be
    helpful to the reader if I set them out below:-

         "35. The [Claimant] did not accept  that  the  [respondent]  had  a
             legal relationship with JA, JH and JO as he had taken no steps
             to formalise his relationship with them or financially support
             them.  He did not meet the definition of 'parent' in paragraph
             6 of the Immigration Rules.  It is  clear  from  the  evidence
             before me that he has built up a genuine parental relationship
             with these children who regard him as their father.  They  are
             all British citizens who were born and have  lived  all  their
             lives in the UK.  They have no connection with  Sierra  Leone.
             They are now all well settled in secondary schools here having
             gone through the English education system from the  beginning.
             JA and JH are both at critical stages of  their  education  as
             they are now in the GCSE stream.  It would be unreasonable for
             them  as  British  citizens  to  be  expected  to  follow  the
             [respondent] to Sierra Leone.  There  is  evidence  before  me
             that  their  work  and  attendance  has  suffered  during  the
             [respondent's] detention not least because they have  to  help
             their mother who is also caring for three children  under  the
             age of 6.  JO has been identified as benefiting from help with
             his speech and language and has  qualified  for  a  disability
             living allowance owing to his need to be constantly supervised
             and needs  support  from  outside  his  home.   I  accept  F's
             evidence that she has no family in the UK and therefore no one
             to whom she can turn  for  support.   It  is  clear  from  the
             children's evidence  that  she  is  finding  life  a  struggle
             without the [respondent's] help particularly as  the  children
             go to separate schools and their  performance  at  school  has
             suffered because of this.  It is not in their  best  interests
             to leave the UK nor reasonable to expect  them  to  it  is  in
             their best interest to remain with their mother in the UK.   I
             find, however, in the circumstances before me that it is  also
             in their best interest for them to remain within a family unit
             consisting of the [respondent].   I  have  referred  to  their
             evidence that, although he is in prison, they have remained in
             close contact with him by visiting  and  telephoning  him  and
             regard him as their father.  They have been adamant as to  the
             caring  and  active  role  he  plays  in  their  lives."   [My
             emphasis]

         ...

         39.  Although I have found previously in  this  determination  that
             the  [respondent]  and  F  have  a  genuine   and   subsisting
             relationship, he formed this relationship whilst he was living
             in  the  UK  unlawfully  and  his   immigration   status   was
             precarious.   For  these  reasons  he  does   not   meet   the
             requirements of paragraph 399(b)(i).  Having  found  that  the
             children's best interests are to remain in the UK  with  their
             mother  and  [the  respondent]  I  do  not  find  that  it  is
             reasonable to expect Felicia to accompany the [respondent]  to
             Sierra Leone, a country to which she has no ties or  has  ever
             visited.  Ms Lambert said that there was no  policy  in  force
             regarding removals to Sierra Leone at this time when there  is
             a medical crisis affecting the whole country  because  of  the
             Ebola outbreak.  F now has settled status in the  UK  in  line
             with her three youngest children.  The oldest children are all
             British citizens and cannot reasonably be  expected  to  leave
             the environment  and  culture  within  which  they  have  been
             brought up.  There is clear evidence before  me  that  she  is
             struggling to cope with the demands of her growing family.   I
             accept  that  she  has  no   family   or   work   here.    The
             [respondent's] removal to Sierra Leone would mean that she was
             left  without  the  [respondent's]  day-to-day  physical   and
             emotional  support  which  would  undoubtedly  impact  on  the
             children as it  has  done  during  his  detention.   In  these
             circumstances I find that it would be 'unduly harsh' for F  to
             be left in the UK on a long-term basis without him."

11.  In those two paragraphs Mr Wilding drew my attention to the  fact  that
    the judge suggests that it "unreasonable" first for the children to  be
    expected to follow the respondent to Sierra Leone  (paragraph  35)  and
    then for F to accompany the respondent to Sierra Leone (paragraph  39).
    The Rules and Act require it to be "unduly harsh".   The  judge  simply
    asked the wrong questions.  The judge was required to assess the impact
    on the children of following the respondent to Sierra Leone and also to
    assess the impact of them remaining in  the  United  Kingdom  with  him
    having been returned to Sierra Leone.  The judge was also  required  to
    perform the same task in  respect  of  his  partner,  F.   Instead,  at
    paragraph 39 the judge has found that it would be unreasonable for  the
    respondent's partner's children to  follow  the  respondent  to  Sierra
    Leone but has not considered whether it would be unduly harsh for  them
    to do so.  She has not gone on to consider whether, if they remained in
    the United Kingdom and the respondent departs to Sierra  Leone  whether
    that would result in any unduly harsh consequences.

12.  As to the grounds of removal of the respondent being  unduly  harsh  in
    terms of the effect it would have on other members of the  family,  the
    judge has set out at paragraph 34  the  framework  which  she  uses  to
    assess the case under it.   This  is,  Mr  Wilding  submitted,  flawed.
    Again, it will be helpful if I set out the paragraph in question:-

         "34. The 'criminality guidance in Article 8  cases'  suggests  that
             the [Claimant] envisages the 'unduly harsh' test as some  form
             of proportionality assessment  (paragraphs  253-254)  but  the
             statute in Immigration Rules are not phrased  in  a  way  that
             indicates it is  a  proportionality  assessment.   Instead  of
             conducting  a  full  proportionality  assessment  taking  into
             account all the circumstances of the case and  balancing  them
             against the public  interest  in  deportation,  which  is  the
             approach contained in the wording of Article 8 of the European
             Convention, and applied  by  the  Strasbourg  Court,  the  new
             scheme simply sets out specific exceptions to deportation that
             would bear no  resemblance  to  a  full  Article  8  balancing
             exercise.  The plain wording of the  exceptions  contained  in
             the statute and Rules pose  a  simple  question;  whether  the
             effect of deportation would be 'unduly harsh'  on  the  child.
             Nothing in the wording suggests that the child's best interest
             should then be weighed against  the  public  interest  or  any
             other factors before deciding whether it is 'unduly harsh'."

    Mr Wilding drew my attention to the decisions of the Upper Tribunal  in
    MAB (Para 399; "unduly harsh") USA [2015] UKUT 435  (IAC)  and  to  the
    decision in KMO (Section 117 - unduly harsh) Nigeria  [2015]  UKUT  543
    (IAC).  At paragraphs 24 and 25 of KMO the Tribunal say this:-

         "24.  The  Immigration  Rules,  when  applied  in  the  context  of
             deportation of a foreign criminal, are a complete code.  Where
             an assessment is required to be made as to  whether  a  person
             meets the requirements of para 399 of the  Immigration  Rules,
             as that comprises an assessment of that person's  claim  under
             Article 8 of the ECHR, it is  necessary  to  have  regard,  in
             making that assessment, to the matters which the Tribunal must
             have regard as a consequence  of  the  provisions  of  Section
             117C.  In particular those include that the more  serious  the
             offence committed, the greater is the public interest  in  the
             deportation  of  a  foreign  criminal.   Therefore,  the  word
             'unduly' in the phrase 'unduly harsh'  requires  consideration
             of whether, in the light of the seriousness  of  the  offences
             committed by the foreign  criminal  and  the  public  interest
             considerations that come into play, the impact on  the  child,
             children or partner of the foreign criminal being deported  is
             inordinately or excessively harsh.

         25.  It might be observed also that  the  Secretary  of  State  has
             published Immigration Directorate Instructions -  Chapter  13:
             Criminality Guidance in Article 8 ECHR Cases.   Although  such
             guidance to decision makers cannot be determinative in matters
             of statutory interpretation, since this has been published  by
             the same department  that  brought  the  Immigration  Bill  to
             Parliament that inserted Section 117 into  the  2002  Act,  it
             might be thought likely that the guidance  at  least  gives  a
             good idea of what the legislation was intended to achieve.  At
             2.5.3 the guidance says this:-

                  2.5.3    The effect of deportation on a qualifying partner
                      or a qualifying  child  must  be  considered  in  the
                      context of the  foreign  criminal's  immigration  and
                      criminal history.  The greater the public interest in
                      deportation the stronger the  countervailing  factors
                      need to be to succeed.  The impact of deportation  on
                      a partner or child can be  harsh,  even  very  harsh,
                      without being unduly harsh, depending on  the  extent
                      of the public interest in deportation and the  family
                      life effected.

                  2.5.4    For example it will usually be more difficult for
                      a foreign criminal who has been sentenced  more  than
                      once to a period of imprisonment of at  least  twelve
                      months but less than four years to  demonstrate  that
                      the effect of deportation would be unduly harsh  than
                      for a foreign criminal who has been  convicted  of  a
                      single offence because repeat offending increases the
                      public interest in  deportation  and  so  requires  a
                      stronger claim to respect for family life in order to
                      outweigh it."

13.  Mr Wilding submitted that there  must  be  a  subjective  analysis  and
    balancing exercise, because the Rules  are  a  complete  code  (see  MF
    Nigeria).

14.  The Immigration Judge appeared  to  query  whether  the  Rules  were  a
    complete code or not (see paragraphs 22 and 23 of  the  determination).



15.  At paragraph 45 of the determination the judge expresses the  need  for
    a fair balance between the rights of  the  individual  and  the  public
    interest.  This, suggested Mr Wilding is not necessarily wrong,  but  a
    fair balance has to recognise that on the Secretary of State's side  of
    the balancing exercise there is a very significant weight to the public
    interest.  The proportionality assessment clearly  favours  deportation
    unless an appellant can demonstrate circumstances of sufficient  weight
    to displace, and then outweigh that presumption.  The approach  adopted
    by the judge discloses a burden on the Secretary of  State  to  justify
    deportation rather than the respondent  establishing  that  his  rights
    under Article 8 are very strong and capable of overcoming the  pressing
    public interest.

16.  Responding at some length Mr Zahir pointed out to  me  that  the  judge
    properly set the law at paragraphs 14 and 16 of her determination.   He
    submitted that the judge very clearly knew what her  function  was  and
    the reasoning of the judge reveals no misdirection  on  her  part.   At
    paragraph 36 of the determination the judge clearly considered the fact
    that the decision would result in the respondent's removal  the  impact
    of which on the children would be unduly harsh.  The  decision  of  the
    judge was not flawed because the judge was entitled to  deal  with  the
    matter in the way that she did.   The  Secretary  of  State  is  simply
    wrong.  Responding briefly, Mr Wilding suggested that the relevance  of
    paragraphs 14 to 16 is unclear because the complaint of  the  Secretary
    of State is the application of the law.   At  paragraph  36  the  judge
    simply fails to consider adequately the question  of  unduly  harshness
    because of the error of law on the part of the judge  at  paragraph  34
    which was that in the judge's view the  question  of  unduly  harshness
    does not factor in the  public  interest  or  other  factors.   A  best
    interest assessment in respect of the children is not a conclusion  but
    paragraph 34 of the determination reads as if  it  is.   It  is  simply
    unclear how far what the judge says at paragraph 35 impacts on what the
    judge subsequently says at  paragraph  36  where  she  finds  that  the
    respondent's removal would be unduly harsh on both the respondent's non-
    biological children and his biological children.

17.  I have concluded that there is  merit  in  the  argument  made  by  the
    Claimant and on their behalf by Mr Wilding.  I believe that  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Stokes did err in law and those  errors  were  material.
    The judge conflated the correct threshold  in  considering  whether  it
    would be reasonable  for  the  respondent's  partner  and  children  to
    accompany him to Sierra Leone with what  is  reasonable.   The  judge's
    approach to paragraph 399A and B is flawed  and  the  judge  failed  to
    provide adequate reasons for concluding that the  respondent's  removal
    would be unduly harsh.  The judge's approach to the need  for  a  "fair
    balance between the rights of the individuals and  public  interest  is
    misconceived.  The correct approach is clearly set  out  in  KMO.   For
    these reasons I have concluded it is necessary to remit the appeal  for
    hearing afresh by a judge other than First Tier Tribunal Judge Stokes..



18.  Although it formed no part of the Secretary  of  State's  challenge  to
    the determination, I have identified two further errors in  it.   I  do
    not believe that they were material, but if  they  were  repeated  they
    might become material.  The  first  is  that  at  paragraph  2  of  the
    determination the judge refers to the fact that the respondent remained
    unlawfully in the United Kingdom from 2011.  In actual fact he  appears
    to have been in the United Kingdom without leave since he became appeal
    rights exhausted in April 2007 or  very  shortly  thereafter.   He  has
    therefore remained in the United Kingdom unlawfully  since  that  time.
    The second error is in  the  last  sentence  at  paragraph  25  of  the
    determination.  The respondent's  partner,  F  is  not  a  person  with
    settled status in the United Kingdom.  She  has  been  granted  limited
    leave to remain for a period of 30 months and issued with  a  biometric
    residence permit at the end of that period she may become  entitled  to
    apply for settlement, but at the  moment  she  is  not  a  person  with
    settled status.

19.  I am told that no interpreter is required, but that  the  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department does not have a copy of the  respondent's
    appeal bundle.  AT's advisers are respectfully  asked  to  ensure  that
    they serve a copy on the Claimant as soon as possible and in any  event
    at least ten days before the remitted hearing.
