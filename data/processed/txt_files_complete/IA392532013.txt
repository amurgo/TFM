               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, born May 10, 1969, is a citizen of India. The  appellant
    first entered the United Kingdom as a domestic worker on July 22, 2007.
    His leave was valid until January 17, 2008 and on January 16,  2008  he
    applied for further leave to remain as a domestic worker but  this  was
    refused on February 2, 2008. On February 14, 2008  he  made  a  further
    application to remain as a domestic worker and on March 20,  2008  this
    was granted until March 20, 2009. On March 20, 2009 he made  a  further
    application to extend his stay  as  a  domestic  worker  and  this  was
    granted on May 11, 2009 extending his leave until May 11, 2010.

 2. On May 8, 2010 he submitted an application to  extend  his  stay  as  a
    domestic worker but this was rejected on May 27,  2010  as  an  invalid
    form had been sent. The respondent wrote to the appellant advising  him
    his application was invalid because the old form was used and this  had
    been replaced with a new form from April 27, 2010. He was  advised  the
    fee paid would be used towards any subsequent  application  but  if  an
    application were not submitted  within  twenty-eight  days  then  steps
    would be taken to refund the fee. The letter concludes-

         "The submission of a valid application, that is, one on the correct
         form which complies with the above requirements does not  guarantee
         the application will be successful."

 3. It appears the appellant did not submit  a  further  application  until
    July 5, 2010 but this was also rejected on July 7, 2010.  On  July  21,
    2010 the appellant lodged a valid application for leave to remain as  a
    domestic worker. This application was granted and his  leave  was  then
    extended  until  January  11,  2012  and  was  further  extended  until
    September 12, 2013.


 4. On October 22, 2012 he submitted an application for indefinite leave to
    remain as a domestic worker. The respondent refused his application  on
    September 13, 2013 and at the same time took decisions to  remove  them
    from the United Kingdom by way of directions under section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006.  His  application  was
    refused  because  the  respondent  was  not  satisfied   he   met   the
    requirements of paragraph 159G(ii) and (v) HC 395. The application  was
    further refused under paragraph 276ADE HC 395 and the respondent  found
    there were no exceptional circumstances meriting consideration  outside
    of the Rules.

 5.  The  appellant  appealed  under  section  82(1)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on September 29, 2013 arguing there had
    been no break in the continuous period he had been living in the United
    Kingdom. The matter  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Napthine (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") on September 15,  2014
    and in a decision promulgated on October 1, 2014 he allowed the appeal.



 6. The respondent lodged grounds of appeal on  October  10,  2014  and  on
    November  18,  2014  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Kelly   gave
    permission to appeal finding there were arguable grounds that the  FtTJ
    had erred in his interpretation of the extant leave provisions.

 7. The matter originally came before me  on  January  6,  2015.  Following
    submissions by Mr Wilding  (Home  Office  Presenting  Officer)  and  Mr
    Davison (the appellant's representative) I  found  there  had  been  an
    error of law.

 8. My reasons for making this finding were:

     a. The appellant had on the evidence before the FtTJ failed to  submit
        a valid application.
     b. The FtTJ wrongly calculated the period of extant 3C leave.

 9. I required the following from the respondent prior to the next hearing:

     a. A copy of the letter dated July 7, 2010 that the respondent sent to
        the appellant.


     b.  The  basis  on  which  the  appellant's  leave  pursuant  to   his
        application dated July 21, 2010 was granted.

     c. Skeleton arguments on whether these documents affected the  current
        situation and why the appellant should not be granted an  extension
        to his leave under paragraph 159EA HC 395.

10. On February 4, 2015 Mr Wilding wrote to the Tribunal and indicated that
    he had been unable to locate the letter dated July  7,  2010  that  was
    said to have been sent to the appellant. However, he had  reviewed  the
    case notes fully and concluded that the decision to grant the appellant
    leave pursuant to his July 2010 application was taken on the  basis  of
    the original application, namely May 8,  2010.  He  therefore  conceded
    there was no  gap  in  the  five  years  continuous  residence  as  the
    extension of his leave in issued in January 2011 was made on the  basis
    of an in-time application. He agreed the appeal should now  be  allowed
    under the Immigration Rules because the appellant  satisfied  paragraph
    159G of those Rules.


11. This information was relayed to the appellant's solicitors and  I  have
    dealt with this appeal on the papers.


    DECISION


12. There was a material error. I have remade the decision and allowed  the
    appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  in  light  of  the   additional
    information.


13. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction. I  see  no
    reason to make an order pursuant to rule 14 of The  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.


Signed:                                 Dated:

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I make no amendment to the order made in the First-tier.
