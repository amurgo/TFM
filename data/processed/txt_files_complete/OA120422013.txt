For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent, Mr Juned Ikalbhai Bhura, [the applicant  and  Appellant
    in the First-tier Tribunal] date  of  birth  7th  October  1987,  is  a
    citizen of India. Having considered the circumstances I do not make  an
    anonymity direction.

 2. The ECO is appealing against the determination of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Blake promulgated on 24th  July  2014.   The  judge  allowed  the
    appeal of the respondent against the decision of the ECO dated 6th  May
    2013 to refuse the respondent entry clearance to the United Kingdom  as
    the spouse or partner of a person present and  settled  in  the  United
    Kingdom. The application was considered under Appendix FM and  appendix
    FM-SE and under Article 8 outside the rules. The appeal was allowed  on
    Article 8 grounds.

 3. The judge found that the respondent did not meet  the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules, specifically Appendix FM and  Appendix  FM-  SE.
    The issue in respect of the rules appears to have been the requirements
    under the rules that the sponsor had a set level  of  income  and  that
    that had to be proved by specified documents.

 4. In order to meet the requirements of the rules the respondent  and  his
    sponsor had to prove that the sponsor received by way of income �18,600
    and produce specified documents to substantiate  such  as  set  out  in
    Appendix FM-SE, in part in accordance with paragraph 7 as  a  part-time
    self-employed person.

 5. The documentation disclosed that the sponsor  was  mainly  employed  by
    Chestnut Nursery School, Newham Ltd  earning  �13,000  per  annum  [pay
    slips for October, November and  December  indicated  a  gross  pay  of
    �1,125, which equates to 13,500 per annum]. In order for the respondent
    to succeed the sponsor had to show that she received a  further  �5,100
    income from other sources or that she had savings of �28,750 to make up
    the shortfall in income.

 6. It was the respondent's case that the sponsor received a further  �7800
    gross income from self-employment as a tailor. The  letter  of  refusal
    clearly sets out the evidence that  was  required  to  prove  that  the
    sponsor earned the required additional money as a self-employed person.
    The sponsor had only been  earning  monies  for  8  months  from  self-
    employment and therefore had to comply with Category F of Appendix  FM-
    SE. Of the documents required the respondent and the sponsor  had  only
    produced two to the ECO. The documents not produced  according  to  the
    reasons for refusal letter included  as  specified  in  Appendix  FM-SE
    paragraph 7:-

          a) Evidence of the amount of tax payable, paid or unpaid for  the
             last financial year.

          b) The latest

               i) annual self-assessment tax return to HMRC

              ii) Statement of Account; and

             iii) The same for the previous financial year

          c) [produced]

          d) [produced]

          e) Where the person holds a separate business bank  account  bank
             statement for the same 12 month period as the tax return

          f) Personal bank statements for the same  12  month  as  the  tax
             return showing the income from self-employment has  been  paid
             into an account in the name of the person or in  the  name  of
             the person and their partner jointly.

          g)  Evidence  of  ongoing  self-employment  through  evidence  of
             payment of Class 2 National Insurance contributions

          h) One of the following documents must also be submitted:-

             i)(aa) If the business is required to produce  annual  audited
             accounts, the latest such account; or

             (bb) If the business is not required to produce annual audited
             accounts,  the  latest  unaudited  accounts  and   accountants
             certificate of confirmation,  from  an  accountant  who  is  a
             member of a UK Recognised Supervisory Body( as defined in  the
             Companies Act 2006);

             ii) A certificate of  VAT  registration  and  the  latest  VAT
             return (a copy or printout) confirming  the  VAT  registration
             number, if turnover is in excess of 73,000

             iii) Evidence to show appropriate planning permission or local
             planning authority consent is held to operate  the  type/class
             of business at the trading address  (where  this  is  a  local
             authority requirement); or

             iv) A franchise agreement signed by both parties

 7. The documents, as identified above and as required under the  rules  to
    substantiate income from self-employment, had not been submitted either
    to the ECO or to the Tribunal.

 8. The judge in paragraph 66 notes with regard to the submissions made  on
    behalf of the ECO:-

         66 She submitted that  the  accountant's  letter  produced  by  the
         Appellant was  not  sufficient  and  there  had  been  no  evidence
         produced to explain why no accounts had been produced.

         [The  references  to  Appellant  in  the  decision  relate  to  the
         respondent in the present proceedings.]

 9.  The judge in considering the requirements of the rules at paragraph 87
    states:-

         87.  I found that the  requirement  in  the  Rules  in  respect  of
         documents was mandatory  and  that  the  Appellant  had  failed  to
         produce the relevant documents in order to meet the requirements of
         the rules.

10. Having found that the respondent and sponsor had  failed  to  meet  the
    requirements of the rules the judge went on to consider Article  8.  In
    so doing the judge makes reference to  the  case  of  MM  (Lebanon  and
    others) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985 and to taking a  purposive  approach
    to the requirements of the rules [see paragraph 105]. In so  doing  the
    judge appears to be drawing a distinction between the rules  which  set
    the income threshold and the rules  which  prescribe  the  evidence  to
    substantiate such an income. Such a difference in  approach  cannot  be
    justified on the basis of the case law. The judge recognises the  Court
    of Appeal had within MM accepted that the new  Immigration  Rules  were
    capable of being compatible with Article 8.

11. The evidence with regard to the financial  means  of  the  sponsor  and
    respondent are set out within paragraph 76 and 77 of the Determination.
    There it is indicated that a self-assessment tax return had been lodged
    as evidence of income from self-employment. There was otherwise  a  P60
    for her employment, which corresponded with the payslips  submitted  in
    respect of the sponsor. Finally within paragraph 77 there is  reference
    to a letter from the appellant's accountants. There does not appear  to
    be any accounts, whether audited or on audited  or  any  of  the  other
    documentation identified by the ECO. The judge appears to  have  relied
    upon a letter  from  an  accountant.  Given  the  circumstances  proper
    accounts and the other documents identified were required to  meet  the
    Rules.

12. The judge in paragraph paragraphs 103 -106 states:-

         103 In the circumstances I accepted, that although it  was  not  in
         the correct form, the evidence that have been placed before the ECO
         was such as to  demonstrate  that  the  appellant  could  meet  the
         financial requirements of the Immigration Rules.

         104 I accepted the submission that the evidence  of  the  Sponsor's
         finances was contained in the P60,  the  accountant's  letter,  the
         bank statements and tax return. I therefore considered on the facts
         of the case before me that the evidence that the appellant met  the
         financial threshold set by the Rules were such as to amount  to  an
         exceptional circumstances not  covered  by  the  immigration  rules
         themselves.

         105 In considering the appeal, I took a purposive approach  to  the
         Immigration Rules. I  note  from  the  authority  of  MM  that  the
         financial threshold had been deemed to be lawful and in pursuit  of
         the legitimate aim and that it had  been  well  researched  by  the
         Secretary Of State.

         106 I considered however that the question of what  evidence  might
         demonstrate the attainment of the threshold was a separate issue. I
         found that  it  would  not  be  rational  to  exclude  evidence  of
         compliance with the lawful financial threshold by excluding certain
         forms of evidence that demonstrate that a couple came within it.  I
         found that the main purpose  of  the  Rule  as  identified  in  the
         authority of MM was to ensure  couples  would  meet  the  financial
         threshold such as to be able to readily integrate into society.

13. It is not for the judge to substitute his view of what should be in the
    Immigration Rules as to the means of proving that a  person  meets  the
    financial threshold, just as much  as  it  is  not  for  the  judge  to
    substitute his view on what that financial  threshold  should  be.  The
    case of MM has clearly established that the New Immigration  Rules  are
    Article 8 compliant. The judge in approaching the issue with regard  to
    Article 8 has merely sought to circumvent the requirements  within  the
    rules as to the means by which a matter has to be proved. Just as  much
    as there are valid reasons as to why the financial threshold was set at
    �18,600 in the Immigration Rules, there are also valid  reasons  as  to
    why accounts, tax documents and the other specified documents  required
    by the rules should be produced to prove that income.

14. It is not for a judge to substitute his own view as  to  how  a  matter
    should be proved and  therefore  to  ignore  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules. The case law makes clear that in assessing Article 8
    outside the rules it is appropriate to consider the criteria within the
    rules in assessing the proportionality exercise. Here it  is  simply  a
    matter that the respondent and sponsor have  not  lodged  the  required
    documents. Once they have the required documents  a  fresh  application
    can be made.

15. The judge in approaching the issue of article 8 has  failed  to  follow
    the guidance within Razgar and MM. The judge has merely found that  the
    fact that other documents prove that the sponsor has the claimed income
    is an exceptional circumstance. The judge then  uses  that  to  justify
    allowing the appeal under article  8  without  following  the  approach
    advocated in Razgar.

16. At the very least that approach ignores the guidance  within  the  case
    law that in considering the final issue in article 8 outside the  rules
    consideration has to be given to the rules themselves in assessing  the
    proportionality. As the rules make specific provision that a matter  is
    to be proved and there are justifiable  reasons  why  those  provisions
    exist, in assessing the proportionality exercise such is a  significant
    factor.

17. In the circumstances the judge's approach with regard to article  8  is
    fundamentally flawed and involves an error of law.

18. I have to determine what the appropriate courses with  regard  to  this
    appeal. The only issue between  the  parties  is  whether  or  not  the
    sponsor has the required income and has the  evidence  to  prove  such.
    Once the sponsor has obtained the required evidence in  proper  form  a
    fresh application can be made for entry clearance. It is accepted  that
    the respondent cannot meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules in
    this application.

19. The issue thereafter is whether this case requires further evidence  to
    resolve the issues between the parties. I am satisfied on the basis  of
    the evidence before me  that  this  case  can  be  properly  determined
    without a further hearing.

20. It has been accepted that this is a genuine marriage and that therefore
    there is a family life. It is for  the  appellant  to  prove  that  the
    decision significantly interferes with that family life.  In  assessing
    that consideration has to be given as to whether the  respondent  could
    go to live in Pakistan and whether or not it is the The  references  to
    Appellant in the decision relate  to  the  respondent  in  the  present
    proceedings. ECO's decision that interferes  with  family  life  rather
    than the respondent and the sponsor's choice  of  where  they  wish  to
    live. There would have to be valid reasons as to why the sponsor cannot
    go to live in Pakistan before  it  could  be  found  that  it  was  the
    decision of the ECO which significantly interfered with family life

21. Even if it is the decision of the ECO that interferes with family life,
    the decision is clearly in accordance with the law and for the purposes
    of maintaining immigration control.

22. In the light of that the final issue to be determined would be  whether
    or not the decision is proportionately  justified.  In  assessing  that
    issue weight has to be given to the fact that  the  United  Kingdom  is
    entitled to control immigration and to set standards which people  have
    to be able to meet in order to enter. Set against that  is  the  family
    life that the respondent and the sponsor clearly have.

23. All that the respondent and  sponsor  need  to  do  is  to  obtain  the
    necessary documentation as required by the rules to  substantiate  that
    the sponsor has the required income. Once  the  required  evidence  has
    been  obtained  the  respondent  would  be  able  to  make  a   further
    application.

24. In the light of that it is clear that the respondent and the  appellant
    have a means by which they can exercise  their  right  to  family  life
    within the United Kingdom. Whilst that requires them to  follow  a  set
    procedure and method of proof such is not unwarranted or unduly onerous
    in the circumstances. Set against that  is  the  right  of  the  United
    Kingdom to control immigration centre set standards which  people  have
    to comply with before they can  enter.  Taking  all  the  factors  into
    account I  find  that  the  decision  by  the  ECO  is  proportionately
    justified.

25. Accordingly for the reasons set out I find that the decision  by  judge
    contains a material  error  of  law  and  I  substitute  the  following
    decision:-

          a) the appeal is dismissed under the immigration rules

          b) The appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds.

26. In light of all the circumstances I make no award of costs.
