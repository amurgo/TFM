Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Blundell, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Lithuania aged 32. He came to the  UK  on
4  May  2008.  He  resided  in  Northern  Ireland  from  2008-2013,   taking
occasional work in the building trade on a self-employed basis. He  did  not
register  as  self-employed  with  HMRC  and  never  paid  tax  or  national
insurance on his earnings. On 17 August  2011  he  was  convicted  at  Newry
Magistrates Court of abstracting electricity and  cultivating  cannabis.  He
was not given a custodial sentence or community penalty,  the  matter  being
dealt with by fines and ancillary orders.  In 2013  the  appellant  went  to
Norway but returned to the UK on 18 March 2014 and found  work  again  on  a
self-employed basis as an online retailer earning between �2,000 and  �3,000
a month but again not registering as self-employed with HMRC. The  appellant
has family in Lithuania, namely his mother, father and sister, with whom  he
is in regular contact.

2.   In November/December 2014 the respondent began  action  to  deport  the
appellant. It appears (so far as is  ascertainable  from  the  file  and  Mr
Mill's own perusal of the Home Office file at my request) that  this  action
was initiated because it came to light in November  2014  that  on  25  June
2002 at  Klapeida  Regional  Court  in  Lithuania  the  appellant  had  been
convicted of murder and  theft  for  which  he  was  sentenced  to  9  years
imprisonment. On 20 January 2004  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  Lithuania  had
varied the sentence to 6 years imprisonment.

3.   On 3 December 2014 the respondent served the appellant  with  a  notice
that he was  liable  to  deportation  in  accordance  with  the  Immigration
(European Economic Areas) Regulations 2006. On 27  May  2015  the  appellant
lodged an in-time appeal against  this  decision.  His  appeal  came  before
First-tier Tribunal (FtT)  Judge  Carlin  who  in  a  decision  sent  on  24
November 2015 dismissed his appeal.

4.   The judge made  clear  in  his  decision  that  he  did  not  find  the
appellant to be a credible witness and in particular  did  not  accept  that
after returning to Lithuania in 2013-14 he lacked  family  support  and  did
not accept that the appellant had been self-employed throughout all  of  the
period 2008-2013.

5.   The judge said he considered both sets of convictions committed by  the
appellant were serious offences. He  stated  that  the  2002  conviction  in
Lithuania "speaks for itself. Although I was  given  no  detail  as  to  the
circumstances of the offence in question, I  accepted  that  the  conviction
was for a particularly  serious  offence  which  resulted  in  death..."  In
regard to the 2011 offences of cultivation of cannabis and  electricity,  he
noted the submissions made on the appellant's behalf that  the  offences  in
themselves were "not the most serious", and noted that on the basis  of  the
appellant's statement he was not involved  with  others  and  was  producing
cannabis for his own use. However, he concluded:
    "17. ... even allowing for the fact that I have not been provided  with
         any information to indicate that the cultivation  of  cannabis  was
         not of a few plants only with no intention to supply others, I  was
         of the view that this is an offence which  involves  a  significant
         amount of planning and  represents  a  significant  breach  of  the
         criminal law. The same can be said of the  offence  of  abstracting
         electricity."

6.   He stated that he did not therefore accept the  submission  that  these
were not serious offences.

7.   The judge next considered the  appellant's  employment  history  noting
that his failure to register as self-employed with HMRC revealed "a man  who
has scant regard for the law".  At [19] he stated:
         "The appellant is self-employed. His business cannot  be  described
         as well established in that it has not been running for  a  lengthy
         period of time. It is also dependent on the  appellant.  Should  he
         fall ill, the business may not operate and  the  appellant  may  be
         without an income. Given that the appellant has  scant  regard  for
         the law and has committed an offence involving  dishonesty  in  the
         past, I take the view that there is a  significant  risk  that  the
         appellant may commit further like offences in the future. Moreover,
         when in times of difficulty in the  past,  the  appellant  took  to
         taking illicit drugs and cultivating  illicit  drugs.  There  is  a
         significant risk that the appellant may commit like offences in the
         future should his business hit difficulties.  Given  the  appellant
         has committed the offence of cultivating drugs, I was of  the  view
         that  any  future  offending  may  involve  supplying  drugs.   The
         appellant has committed a particularly serous offence  of  violence
         in the past. Even whilst accepting that the appellant is older  now
         and the offence was committed some 13 years ago, there is a risk of
         offences of violence in the future.  I  therefore  deal  with  this
         appeal on the basis that the appellant is a person who is likely to
         commit further offences should he remain in the UK."

8.   At [23] he added:
         "In my view the fact the appellant may commit [further offences  of
         the type outlined  earlier  which  included  risk  of  offences  of
         violence  -  see  [19]]-  represents   a   genuine,   present   and
         sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the  fundamental
         interests  of  society.  In  coming  to  this  conclusion,  I   was
         influenced by the  risk  of  further  offending  generally  but  in
         particular the risk of cultivation and supply of illicit drugs  ...
         In making my decision, I do not rely on  the  appellant's  criminal
         convictions but  also  on  [his]  actions  in  carrying  out  self-
         employment  whilst  making  no  effort  to  pay  tax  and  National
         Insurance. This indicates somebody who  has  scant  regard  to  the
         law."

9.   The judge also considered that so far as rehabilitation  was  concerned
the evidence was that the appellant had strong links to  Lithuania  and  the
disadvantage of not being able to obtain work there was  outweighed  by  the
support the appellant would get from his family. He concluded that the  fact
that the appellant had got some employment tin  the  UK  despite  no  family
support and with inevitable language difficulties "led me to  conclude  that
he is likely to get employment in Lithuania".

10.  The grounds of appeal challenge (i) the  "huge  leap"  the  judge  made
from the evidence that the cultivation of cannabis was for his  own  use  to
the finding that there was a significant risk of  the  appellant  committing
offences in the future that may involve supplying drugs; (ii)  the  lack  of
any evidential basis for the judge's conclusion that the  appellant  was  at
risk of committing further violent offences; (iii) the failure of the  judge
when considering the 2002 offence to take into account  that  the  appellant
was only 16 at the time; (iv) the lack of evidential basis for  the  judge's
finding that the appellant would be able to obtain support from  his  family
in Lithuania and would be able  to  find  work  there,  notwithstanding  the
appellant's evidence that he could not get a job in Lithuania  in  2013  and
had to use all his savings from the UK to live there.

11.  In deciding whether the judge materially erred in law it is helpful  to
first set out the precise text of regulation 21 and  then  to  identify  two
cases that  have  a  particular  bearing  on  this  case.  In  order  for  a
deportation decision to be compatible with the  2006  Regulations,  it  must
adhere to the criteria set out in regulation 21, which provides:
    "Decisions taken on public policy, public security  and  public  health
    grounds
    21. -    (1)  In this regulation a "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
         decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public security  or
         public health.
         (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.
         (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
         with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15  except  on
         serious grounds of public policy or public security.
         (4)  A relevant decision may not  be  taken  except  on  imperative
         grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-
             (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period
             of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or
             (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision  is
             necessary in his  best  interests,  as  provided  for  in  the
             Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted by  the  General
             Assembly of the United Nations on 20th November 1989.
         (5)  Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public policy
         or public security it shall, in  addition  to  complying  with  the
         preceding paragraphs of this regulation,  be  taken  in  accordance
         with the following principles-
             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
             proportionality;
             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
             conduct of the person concerned;
             (c)   the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
             represent a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
             affecting one of the fundamental interests of society;
             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
             which relate to considerations of general  prevention  do  not
             justify the decision;
             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
             themselves justify the decision.
         (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy or public security in relation to a person who  is  resident
         in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker  must  take  account  of
         considerations such  as  the  age,  state  of  health,  family  and
         economic situation of the person, the person's length of  residence
         in the United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural integration
         into the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
         his country of origin.
         (7)  In the case of a relevant decision taken on grounds of  public
         health-
             (a)  a disease  that  does  not  have  epidemic  potential  as
             defined by  the  relevant  instruments  of  the  World  Health
             Organisation or is not a disease to which section  38  of  the
             Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 applies (detention
             in hospital of a person with a notifiable disease)  shall  not
             constitute grounds for the decision; and
             (b)  if  the  person  concerned  is  in  the  United  Kingdom,
             diseases occurring after the three month period  beginning  on
             the date on which he arrived in the United Kingdom  shall  not
             constitute grounds for the decision."

12.  In Straszewski v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  [2015]
EWCA Civ 1245  Moore Bick LJ was concerned with the cases  of   persons  who
had acquired a right of permanent  residence,  but  in  the  course  of  his
judgment he identified key  features  that  must  govern  all  proportionate
deportation decisions  made  under  the  Regulations,  including  that:  the
burden is proof is on the respondent ([12]); that a deportation  measure  is
an exception to the principle of free movement of persons and hence must  be
applied restrictively  ([13]);  that  the  necessary  threshold  is  one  of
sufficient severity; it is not enough that a person's conduct may  adversely
affect the fundamental interests  of  society  ([25]);  that  the  principal
focus must be on propensity to re-offend ([15], [16]);  and  that  decisions
must not take into account deterrence or public revulsion in  the  same  way
as is justified under  non-EEA  deportations.   The  last  two  points  were
stated in [30] in the following terms.
         "... is to be determined solely by reference to the conduct of  the
         offender (no doubt viewed in the context of any previous offending)
         and the  likelihood  of  re-offending.  General  considerations  of
         deterrence and public revulsion normally have no part  to  play  in
         the matter."

13.  At [25] Moore-Bick LJ noted:
         ""Public policy" for these purposes includes the  policy  which  is
         reflected in the interest of the state in protecting  its  citizens
         from violent crime and the  theft  of  their  property.  These  are
         fundamental interests of society and therefore, although regulation
         21(3) does not speak in terms of the risk of causing harm by future
         offending, in a case of this  kind  that  is  the  risk  which  the
         Secretary of State  is  called  upon  to  assess  when  considering
         deportation.  That  requires  an  evaluation  to  be  made  of  the
         likelihood that the person concerned will offend again and what the
         consequences are likely to be if he does. In addition, the need for
         the conduct of the person concerned to  represent  a  "sufficiently
         serious" threat to one of  the  fundamental  interests  of  society
         requires the decision-maker to balance  the  risk  of  future  harm
         against the need to give effect to the right of free  movement.  In
         any given case an evaluative exercise of that  kind  may  admit  of
         more than one answer. If so, provided that all appropriate  factors
         have been taken into  account,  the  decision  cannot  be  impugned
         unless it is perverse  or  irrational,  in  the  sense  of  falling
         outside the range of permissible decisions."

14.  The other case is MC (Essa principles recast)  [2015]  UKUT  520  (IAC)
The headnote to that decision states:
         1.   Essa rehabilitation principles are specific to decisions taken
         on public policy, public security and public health  grounds  under
         regulation 21 of the 2006 EEA Regulations.
         2.   It is only if the personal conduct of the person concerned  is
         found to represent a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
         threat affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of  society
         (regulation 21(5)(c)) that it becomes relevant to consider  whether
         the  decision  is  proportionate  taking  into  account   all   the
         considerations identified in regulation 21(5)-(6).
         3.   There is no specific reference in the expulsion provisions  of
         either  Directive  2004/38/EC  or  the  2006  EEA  Regulations   to
         rehabilitation, but it has been seen by the Court of Justice as  an
         aspect of integration, which is one of the factors referred  to  in
         Article 28(1) and regulation 21(6) ( Essa (2013) at [23]).
         4.   Rehabilitation is not an issue to be addressed  in  every  EEA
         deportation or removal decision taken under regulation 21; it  will
         not be relevant, for example, if rehabilitation  has  already  been
         completed ( Essa (2013) at [32]-[33]).
         5.   Reference to prospects of rehabilitation  concerns  reasonable
         prospects of a person ceasing to commit  crime  (  Essa  (2013)  at
         [35]), not the mere possibility of rehabilitation. Mere  capability
         of rehabilitation is not to be equated with reasonable prospect  of
         rehabilitation.
         6.   Where relevant (see (4) above) such prospects are a factor  to
         be taken into account in the proportionality assessment required by
         regulation 21(5) and (6) (( Dumliauskas [41]).
         7.   Such prospects are to be taken into account even if not raised
         by the offender (Dumliauskas [52]).
         8.    Gauging  such  prospects  requires  assessing  the   relative
         prospects of rehabilitation in the host Member  State  as  compared
         with those in the Member State of origin, but, in  the  absence  of
         evidence, it is not to be assumed  that  prospects  are  materially
         different in that other Member State ( Dumliauskas [46],  [52]-[53]
         and [59]).
         9.   Matters that are relevant when examining the prospects of  the
         rehabilitation   of   offenders    include    family    ties    and
         responsibilities, accommodation, education,  training,  employment,
         active membership of a community and the  like  (  Essa  (2013)  at
         [34]). However, lack of access to a Probation Officer or equivalent
         in  the  other  Member  State  should  not,  in  general,  preclude
         deportation ( Dumliauskas [55])
         10.  In the  absence  of  integration  and  a  right  of  permanent
         residence, the future prospects of integration cannot be a  weighty
         factor ( Dumliauskas [44] and [54]). Even when such prospects  have
         significant weight they are not a trump card, as what the Directive
         and the 2006 EEA Regulations require  is  a  wide-ranging  holistic
         assessment. Both recognise  that  the  more  serious  the  risk  of
         reoffending, and the offences that a person may commit, the greater
         the right to interfere with the right of residence (Dumliauskas  at
         [46] and [54]).

Analysis

15.  I remind myself that I am not entitled to interference in the  decision
of the judge unless it is vitiated by legal error and that "[i]n  any  given
case an evaluative exercise of that kind may admit of more than one  answer.
As noted by Moore-Bick LJ in Straszewski at [25]  then,  "[i]  so,  provided
that all appropriate factors have been  taken  into  account,  the  decision
cannot be impugned unless it is perverse or  irrational,  in  the  sense  of
falling outside the range of permissible decisions."

16.  I am not persuaded by the appellant's third and fourth  grounds  (as  I
have numbered them) because even though  the  judge's  findings  as  regards
family support and employment prospects in  Lithuania  were  different  from
the appellant's own account, the judge did not find  his  evidence  credible
in certain respects. The grounds  do  not  as  such  challenge  the  judge's
primary findings of fact and in any event I am satisfied that  it  was  open
to the judge to come to  those  findings,  even  if  the  finding  regarding
prospects of work in Lithuania did border on  the  speculative.  However,  I
see force in the first  two  grounds  and  observe  that  Mr  Mills  himself
accepted that the judge had fallen into error in his assessment of the  core
question of risk of re-offending.

17.  Two  essential  planks  to  the  judge's  finding  that  the  appellant
represented a genuine, present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting
fundamental interests of society were that he would  engage  again  in  drug
offending extending to supplying drugs and would commit crimes of  violence.
However, neither of these planks  had  a  proper  or  sufficient  evidential
foundation. On the judge's own description of the facts, there  was  nothing
to  show  that  the  appellant  had  cultivated  cannabis  fin   significant
quantities or to supply others. The offences  committed  in  Newry  had  not
attracted any custodial sentence or community order. If the  risk  was  only
of similar offences  occurring  in  the  future,  it  could  not  fairly  be
described as a sufficiently serious  one  posing  a  threat  "affecting  the
fundamental interests of society". The judge was only able  to  get  to  the
conclusion that they would be sufficiently serious by  presuming  such  drug
offences would escalate into offence  of  supply.  Not  only  was  there  no
evidential basis for that  but  the  appellant  had  no  history  of  supply
activities of any kind. It is true the judge appeared to  consider  that  he
could reach such a conclusion based on the fact that  the  appellant's  lack
of registration as self-employed with HMRC  showed  "scant  regard  for  the
law", but the appellant's own history of offending in the UK did not in  any
way suggest that his scant regard to the law in  relation  to  paying  taxes
had inclined him to commit other criminal offences. In addition the  judge's
assessment that the  appellant  would  commit  such  offences  was  in  turn
predicated on the appellant falling ill, even though there was  no  evidence
that the appellant had poor health. The judge's reasoning on this issue  was
riddled with non-sequiturs.

18.  The  judge's  evidential  basis  for  the  second  main  plank  of  his
reasoning is even more lacking. Despite avowing that  he  fully  appreciated
that regulation 21(5) proscribed reliance  solely  on  a  previous  criminal
conviction, the judge's subsequent assessment depended heavily on  the  fact
of past convictions. The judge proceeded  to  conclude  that  the  appellant
posed a risk of committing violent offences in the future, even  though  the
appellant had no conviction for violence for the past 13 years and  when  he
committed his only offence of violence, particularly grave as it  was  -  it
was when he was 16. On the judge's own  reasoning  -  that  the  appellant's
criminality was likely to manifest itself when he faced difficulties  -  the
appellant could have been expected to commit violent  offences  in  Northern
Ireland at the  time  when  he  was  cultivating  cannabis  and  abstracting
electivity. He plainly didn't. Effectively  the  judge  treated  the  murder
conviction in Lithuania as one that demonstrated a continuing propensity  to
commit violent offences,  despite  there  been  no  evidence  whatsoever  to
suggest that there was any significant risk of that  propensity  translating
itself into action.

19.  Another shortcoming in  the  judge's  determination  was  that  despite
reaching a conclusion that the appellant  represented  a  "present"  threat,
there was nothing to suggest that the judge gave any weight at  all  to  the
fact that the appellant had not committed an offence of any kind since  mid-
2011, that is, nearly 5 years ago. It is impossible to avoid the  conclusion
that  for  the  judge  the  past  offences   were   regarded   as   decisive
notwithstanding the need to show present threat and,  as  part  of  that,  a
significant future risk of re-offending.

20.  For the above reasons I consider that the  judge  materially  erred  in
law and his decision must be set aside.

Decision re-made

21.  I turn to consider whether I am in a position to re-make this  decision
without further  ado.  Neither  party  has  sought  to  adduce  any  further
evidence. I have decided that I am in a position to proceed on the basis  of
the evidence before me.

22.  Even on the basis of the judge's principal findings  of  fact  relating
to the appellant's lack of credibility and the  reality  of  his  incomplete
working history in the UK and the  real  prospects  of  him  being  able  to
obtain both family support and employment  back  in  Lithuania,  I  consider
that the deportation order is not consistent with the criteria  set  out  in
regulation 21. In particular, the  evidence  does  not  establish  that  the
appellant represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious  threat  to
one of the fundamental interests of society in the UK.

23.  It is clear from the agreed chronology of events that the  decision  to
take deportation  action  would  not  have  been  made  in  respect  of  the
appellant's last offences committed in 2011 on their own  as  they  did  not
come anywhere near qualifying him for deportation  action.  Those  offences,
to repeat, did not even attract a custodial sentence, and  on  the  findings
of fact made by the First-tier Tribunal judge (which I  have  no  reason  to
depart from) involved only  cultivation  of  cannabis  for  the  appellant's
personal use. The only reason that deportation action was taken  -  after  a
very considerable delay - was because it came to light  that  the  appellant
had been convicted of murder in 2002. It is  hard  to  understand  why  such
information was not unearthed earlier,  but  Mr  Mills  said  that  in  2014
procedures were less rigorous than they are today.

24.  It is entirely  understandable  that  information  regarding  the  2003
offence of aggravated murder should cause the  case  to  be  considered  for
deportation action, but at the same time, in order to comply with  the  2006
Regulations,  such  consideration  was  required  to  address,  inter  alia,
whether  there  was  any  basis  for  considering  that  the  2002   offence
demonstrated a propensity to re-offend in the form of a crime  of  violence.
One looks in vain in the respondent's supplementary decision letter of  June
2015 for any such consideration. What was said was simply this:
    "Even though the exact circumstances of your offence in  Lithuania  are
    not known, on 25 June 2002 ... you were convicted of murder  and  theft
    for which you were sentenced to 9 years imprisonment  ...  [reduced  in
    January 2004 to 6 years].
    The consequences for all those involved  in,  or  touched  by,  violent
    crime are enormous. You did not give any thought for  the  consequences
    of your actions.  Your victim would have doubtless suffered great  pain
    and the sense of fear by the events which led  to  there  [sic]  death.
    Moreover, incidents of this nature can have a wider impact upon society
    in that they create a climate of fear and insecurity in our communities
    and especially the impact of this appalling crime  on  the  family  and
    friends".

25.  Further on, the refusal letter observed that:
    "You have demonstrated through your actions that  you  are  capable  of
    causing psychological and physical harm to others. You appear  to  have
    given no consideration to the consequences of your actions. The  nature
    of your offence shows that you have the  potential  to  act  violently,
    with no provocation, especially when you feel wronged, this resulted in
    the death of the victim."

26.  The troubling feature of these statements is that there was nothing  on
the file to suggest that the respondent had any details regarding  the  2002
offence beyond the bare criminal conviction information which did  not  give
any details about the circumstances of the crime.

27.  Whilst it  was  within  the  range  of  reasonable  responses  for  the
respondent to infer from these bare details that the crime was one  a  grave
one and perhaps that it was inflicted to cause pain and suffering, the  same
cannot be said for the observation that "[y]ou did not give any thought  for
the consequences of your actions". That may have been the case, but  it  was
not necessarily so and one is left with  the  strong  impression  that  this
paragraph was  a  stock  one  applied  without  regard  to  the  appellant's
particular circumstances.  That is also suggested by other passages  in  the
decision letter, e.g.  "[y]ou have shown no remorse for your behaviour"  and
"[y]ou have the potential to act violently, with no provocation  ..."  There
was no evidential foundation for  those  findings.  Another  passage  almost
suggests that the respondent wrongly considered the appellant to  have  been
a frequent offender ("... you appear to have given no consideration  to  the
time and public funds spent each time you offend ...").

28.  The impression that the decision letter did not pay  proper  regard  to
the appellant's actual case was  reinforced  by  another  paragraph  of  the
decision  letter  dealing  with  the  appellant's  drug  convictions,  which
appears to be based on the mistaken premise that he had  been  convicted  of
supply: "The trade in illicit drugs has a  severe  and  negative  impact  on
society...since addicts are often  driven  to  commit  ancillary  crimes  in
order to  finance  their  habit,  those  involved  in  supplying  drugs  are
involved in a process  that  has  harmful  consequences  for  society  as  a
whole..." Nor does the language of this letter inspire confidence  that  its
author understood that in EEA deportation appals regard  cannot  be  had  to
deterrence and public revulsion: see Straszewski.

29.  It was entirely within  the  range  of  reasonable  responses  for  the
respondent to have stated, on the basis  of  the  2002  offence,  that  "The
nature of your offence shows that you have the potential to act  violently";
but, as already noted,  what the  respondent  was  further  required  to  do
under the 2006 Regulations was asses whether this propensity  was  one  that
posed a present and sufficiently serious  threat  and  in  that  context  to
consider whether the fact that the appellant was a minor at the time of  the
offence and that he had not committed any  violent  offence  in  the   13-14
years since were factors that made any difference.

30.  On the basis of  the  evidence  before  me  there  is  an  insufficient
evidential basis for the conclusion  that  the  appellant  poses  a  present
threat of committing violent offences. To repeat what was said earlier  when
finding a material error  of  law,  the  appellant  had  not  committed  any
offence of violence for  the  past  13-14  years,  despite  on  the  judge's
findings. On the evidence before  me,  given  that  the  appellant  had  not
committed any further drugs offence since 2011, there  was  an  insufficient
basis for considering that he posed a present threat of committing  such  an
offence again - and certainly not one involving supply  (as  the  First-tier
Tribunal judge had thought). I remind myself that in EEA deportation  cases,
the onus is on the respondent to justify restriction of a person's  exercise
of freedom of movement. In  light  of  the  evidence  before  me,  the  only
conclusion I can reach is that the respondent had not  discharged  the  onus
on her of showing that the  deportation  decision  was  proportionate.  This
conclusion is not to belittle the horror of the 2002 conviction  for  murder
or  the  fact  that  the  appellant's  drug  offence  (and  abstraction   of
electricity offence in 2011 were serious offences, but it  is  to  underline
that to cross the thresholds set out  in  regulation  21  of  the  2006  EEA
Regulations it is not enough to show a  history  of  commission  of  serious
offences without regard to temporal considerations which include that  there
had been no further crime of violence for over 13 years and  no  offence  of
any kind since 2011.

31.  As regards rehabilitation, since the appellant was not someone who  had
acquired permanent residence, significant weight cannot be attached  to  the
prospects of rehabilitation (see MC) and I do not do so. However, it  cannot
be said that in this case rehabilitation was  of  any  particular  relevance
since in the absence of any present threat posed by re-offending of  a  type
that would affect fundamental  interests  of  society,  the  fact  that  the
appellant might be able to live and work in Lithuania and  be  supported  by
family there was irrelevant. It is a blot on the appellant's character  that
he has not registered with HMRC and he may wish to bear in mind that  albeit
a civil matter his failure to do so will be  a  relevant  factor  should  he
commit any further criminal offences and face further action to  deport.  It
may also impact  negatively  on  any  future  claim  by  him  for  permanent
residence as it  makes  it  much  more  difficult  for  him  to  demonstrate
continuous economic activity.

32.  For the above reasons:

    The First-tier Tribunal materially erred in law.

    The decision I re-make is  to  allow  the  appellant's  appeal  against
    deportation under the 2006 Regulations.
