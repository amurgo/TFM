For the Respondents:   Mr Z Jafferji, instructed by Mayfair Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although the Secretary of State is the Appellant in this appeal I refer
    to the parties as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The first Appellant is Mr [B], the second Appellant is  his  wife,  and
    the third Appellant  is  their  daughter.  The  first  Appellant  is  a
    national of Pakistan and the second and third Appellants are  nationals
    of Turkey.  The Appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal  against
    a decision made by  the  Secretary  of  State  on  20th  December  2017
    refusing the first Appellant's  application  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in the UK on the basis of ten years' residence and the  decision
    of 12th  February  2018  refusing  the  second  and  third  Appellants'
    applications for leave to remain as dependants of the first  Appellant.
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Zahed  allowed  the  appeals  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 9th January 2019.  The Secretary of  State  now  appeals
    against that decision with permission granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Grimmett on 31st January 2019.

 3. In the Grounds of Appeal the Secretary of State contends the First-tier
    Tribunal made a material misdirection in law by failing  to  apply  the
    reasoning of the Upper Tribunal in the case of R  (on  the  application
    of) Khan v Secretary of State for the Home Department  (dishonesty  tax
    return paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC) when assessing whether
    the first Appellant acted dishonestly in relation to his dealings  with
    UKVI or HMRC.  It is contended  in  the  grounds  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge did not  follow  the  recommended  steps  in  Khan  when
    assessing the first Appellant's actions and failed to  provide  reasons
    why he accepted that the Appellant would not have  been  aware  of  the
    errors in his tax returns sooner given that  his  tax  liability  would
    have been significantly  lower  than  expected  as  his  earnings  were
    undeclared by several thousands of pounds.  It is contended that  there
    are no findings as to why the significant discrepancy was not rectified
    by the first Appellant sooner  given  that  he  would  personally  have
    received his tax bill as a self-employed person.  It is argued that the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in  his  assessment  of  the
    Appellants' actions.  It  is  further  contended  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge materially erred in finding that the actions of HMRC  in
    not issuing any penalties or initiating  any  proceedings  against  the
    Appellant as being in some way determinative of the  first  Appellant's
    action.  Further in the grounds reliance was placed on the findings  of
    the  Upper  Tribunal  in  the  judicial  review  cases  of  R  (on  the
    application of) Samant v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2017]  UKAIT  URJR/5646/2016  and  Abbasi  JR/13807/2016  which   make
    findings relating to the  relevance  of  the  actions  that  HMRC  take
    against Appellants.  This contended that there are several reasons  why
    HMRC would not take action against the first  Appellant  and  that  the
    judge accordingly erred in finding that HMRC's actions are in some  way
    determinative of whether the Appellant's actions  could  be  viewed  as
    dishonesty.

 4. The background to this appeal is that the first Appellant  entered  the
    UK as a student on 28th July 2006 with a visa valid  until  30th  April
    2008 and was granted extensions of his leave to remain  on  that  basis
    until October 2010.  He was subsequently granted leave to remain  as  a
    Tier 1 Highly Skilled person until 22nd April 2012  and  as  a  Tier  1
    (General) Migrant until 26th January 2013 and then until  24th  January
    2016.  He made application for indefinite leave to remain as a  Tier  1
    (General) Migrant on  30th  December  2015  but  that  application  was
    refused and his subsequent application for indefinite leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant was refused on 23rd  February  2017.   He
    requested an administrative review but that decision was maintained and
    on 18th April 2017 he applied for indefinite leave to remain.

 5. The application for indefinite leave to  remain  was  considered  under
    paragraph 276B  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   However  the  Respondent
    considered paragraph 322 of the Immigration Rules which  contained  the
    general Grounds for Refusal.  The Secretary of  State  concluded  that,
    whilst the Appellant had accrued ten years' continuous residence in the
    UK, he fell under the general  Grounds  for  Refusal  because,  in  his
    application of 9th December 2010 for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (General)  Migrant,  he  claimed  that  he  had  previous  earnings  of
    �40,143.34 whereas his original tax return for  2010/2011  he  declared
    the significantly lower income of �9730. On the  basis  of  the  amount
    declared to the Home Office he was awarded 35 points and obtained leave
    to remain as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant.   Following  this  period  of
    leave he submitted a further application as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant
    dated 10th January 2013 and in relation to this application he  claimed
    that he had previous earnings of �42,370.15 from four sources of income
    including earnings from employment and  self-employment.   He  provided
    evidence in relation to these earnings and was awarded  25  points  and
    obtained leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant.   However  his
    original  tax  returns  for  April  2012  and  April  2013  declared  a
    significantly lower total income of �17,285.

 6. According to the reasons for refusal  letter  the  Secretary  of  State
    wrote to the Appellant on 12th September 2017 in  connection  with  his
    application for indefinite leave to remain requesting that he  complete
    and  return  a  tax  questionnaire  with  reference  to  his   previous
    application.  The Secretary of State stated that the Appellant did  not
    return  this  questionnaire  as  requested  and  considered  that   the
    Appellant failed to meet the requirements of  paragraph  322(9)  having
    failed to provide requested information.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge
    considered that the Respondent had not made out this ground as  on  the
    basis of evidence that a  tax  questionnaire  had  been  responded  and
    considered that paragraph 322(9) did not apply.  The judge's finding in
    this matter has not been challenged.

 7. The Secretary of State also went on to set out  how  checks  made  with
    HMRC revealed that the Appellant declared  tax  returns  for  the  year
    ending 2010/11 and 2011/12 and 2012/13 all showed amounts  of  declared
    income  which  were  lower  than  those  claimed  in  the   Appellant's
    applications for leave to  remain.   It  is  stated  that  the  initial
    declared income to HMRC would have led to the award of zero  points  in
    the previous earnings category.  The Secretary of State did not  accept
    that the failure to declare to  HMRC  at  the  time  the  self-employed
    earnings on his previous applications for leave to remain in the UK  as
    a Tier 1 (General) Migrant were genuine errors.   In  the  reasons  for
    refusal letter the Secretary of State  rejected  the  explanations  put
    forward by the Appellant and refused the  application  under  paragraph
    276B(ii) and (iii) with reference to paragraphs 322(5) and (9)  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 8. The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered the issue of paragraph  322(5)
    at paragraph 17 to 24 of the decision.  In essence the judge  concluded
    that the Appellant was not dishonest in his dealings with HMRC  or  the
    Home Office with regard to his Tier 1 application in December 2010  and
    his tax return year ending April 2011 [19] and that  he  had  not  been
    dishonest in his dealings with  HMRC  and  UKVI  in  his  January  2013
    application and the tax returns corresponding to that application [23].

 9. At the hearing before me Mr Avery contended  that  the  judge  took  an
    erroneous approach to dealing with the evidence.  He  referred  to  the
    guidance given in the  decision  of  Khan  and  in  particular  to  the
    guidance in the head note.  He contended that here the judge had  given
    a lack of detail for why the Appellant's explanation had been accepted.
     In his submission in this case the  discrepancy  between  the  amounts
    declared to HMRC in the 2010/11 tax year was over �30,000 less than the
    amount the Appellant claimed to have earned in the application  to  the
    Home Office.  In his contention the judge failed to grapple  with  this
    issue and failed to give an explanation as to how the mistake  occurred
    which in his view was not adequate given the  magnitude  of  the  error
    made by the accountants.  In his submission the judge accepted  a  weak
    letter from the accountants and this reflects a lack  of  attention  to
    the circumstances which would  not  have  happened  if  the  judge  had
    approached the case in the manner set out in Khan.

10. In the case of Khan Mr Justice Martin  Spencer  set  out  the  approach
    which should be followed as follows:

         "(i) Where there has been  a  significant  difference  between  the
         income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain  and
         the income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is entitled  to
         draw  an  inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been  deceitful  or
         dishonest and therefore he should be refused ILR  within  paragraph
         322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules.   Such  an  inference  could  be
         expected  where  there  is  no  plausible   explanation   for   the
         discrepancy.

         (ii) Where an  Applicant  has  presented  evidence  to  show  that,
         despite the prima facie inference, he was not in fact dishonest but
         only careless, then the Secretary of State must decide whether  the
         explanation and evidence is sufficient, in her  view,  to  displace
         the prima facie inference of deceit/dishonesty.

         (iii)    In approaching that fact-finding task,  the  Secretary  of
         State should remind herself that, although the standard of proof is
         the "balance of probability", a finding  that  a  person  has  been
         deceitful and dishonest in relation to his  tax  affairs  with  the
         consequence that he is denied settlement in this country is a  very
         serious finding with serious consequences.

         (iv) For an Applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for  an
         "error" in relation to the historical tax return will  not  be  the
         end of the matter, given that the accountant will  or  should  have
         asked the tax payer to confirm that the return was accurate and  to
         have signed the tax return. Furthermore  the  Applicant  will  have
         known of his or her earnings and will  have  expected  to  pay  tax
         thereon.  If the Applicant does not take steps within a  reasonable
         time to remedy  the  situation,  the  Secretary  of  State  may  be
         entitled to conclude that this failure justifies a conclusion  that
         there has been deceit or dishonesty.

         (v)  When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest  or
         merely  careless  the  Secretary  of  State  should  consider   the
         following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to which  they
         are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):

             i.   Whether the explanation for the error by  the  accountant
             is plausible;

             ii.  Whether the documentation which can be assumed  to  exist
             (for example, correspondence between  the  Applicant  and  his
             accountant at the time of the tax return) has  been  disclosed
             or there is a plausible explanation for why it is missing;

             iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had  been
             made because his liability to pay tax was less than he  should
             have expected;

             iv.  Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken  steps  to
             remedy the situation and, if so, when those steps  were  taken
             and the explanation for any significant delay."

11. At paragraph 32 of  the  decision  Mr  Justice  Spencer  sets  out  the
    starting point is  that  where  the  Secretary  of  State  discovers  a
    significant  difference  between  the  income  claimed  in  a  previous
    application for leave to remain and the income declared to HMRC she  is
    entitled to draw an inference that the Appellant has been deceitful  or
    dishonest and therefore he  should  be  refused  ILR  within  paragraph
    322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  However it does not  follow  that  in
    all such cases a decision to refuse ILR will be lawful.  It is  pointed
    out that where an  applicant  has  presented  evidence  to  show  that,
    despite the prime facie inference, he was not  in  fact  dishonest  but
    only careless, then the Secretary of State is presented  by  the  fact-
    finding task which must be carried out fairly and lawfully and in  that
    regard Judge Spencer considered that the Secretary of  State  needs  to
    remind him or herself;

         "... that finding that person has been deceitful and  dishonest  in
         relation to his tax affairs  with  the  consequence  he  is  denied
         settlement in this country is a very serious finding  with  various
         consequences and therefore the evidence must be cogent  and  strong
         although, as the authorities show, the standard of proof remains on
         the balance of probabilities".

    The decision highlights that it is not enough for an  applicant  simply
    to blame his or her accountant [33].  It sets out guidance  as  to  the
    factors which should be considered in situations where there have  been
    discrepancies between previous applications for leave to remain and tax
    returns which had been made covering the same period.

12. Mr Jafferji contended that, as the decision in Khan related to judicial
    review where the primary issue is the rationality of the  Secretary  of
    State's decision, the guidance there is primarily to the  Secretary  of
    State in the context of a judicial review challenge  where  the  issues
    are whether the decision was irrational.  However he accepted that  the
    guidance in Khan is useful.  In his submission the issue was whether it
    had been applied in substance.  I accept that there is no error on  the
    part of the judge to have failed to refer to Khan but that the guidance
    there is useful and that the  issue  is  not  whether  he  specifically
    referred to the  case  but  whether  he  took  the  right  approach  to
    considering paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.

13. I accept Mr Jafferji's submission that there was a  significant  amount
    of evidence before the First-tier Tribunal in  the  Appellant's  bundle
    which contains the Appellant's  witness  statement,  his  original  and
    amended tax return from 2011 and his original and  amended  tax  return
    from 2012/13, correspondence with his accountants  and  an  explanation
    from his current accountant.  The explanation from his accountant about
    the error is at  page  36  of  the  Appellant's  bundle.   That  letter
    explains that the accountant made an error on the tax  return  for  the
    year  2010/2011.   It  states  that  the  accountant  made   an   error
    inadvertently having overlooked some documents provided to the firm due
    to the high volume of workload at  that  particular  time.   The  judge
    referred to this letter at paragraph 17 of the decision.  It  is  clear
    that the judge took this letter into account and accepted  that  it  is
    more than a bare assertion  or  that  the  Appellant  was  blaming  the
    accountant for an error.

14. At paragraph 18 the judge took into account the Appellant's evidence as
    to why he did not check the tax  return.   The  judge  noted  that  the
    Appellant accepted that it was  his  responsibility  to  check  it  but
    stated that he was under a lot of strain in his personal life. He  gave
    evidence about an issue in relation to his marriage which went on for a
    number of years and the Appellant explained that it was in the  context
    of this background that he did not check the tax  return  knowing  that
    the accountants had been recommended  to  him  and  they  had  all  the
    invoices and documents needed to complete the return.

15. The judge said at paragraph 19

         "I  have  carefully  looked  at  all  the  documents  and  had   an
         opportunity to see and hear the Appellant give  evidence.   I  find
         that having seen the documents and noting that  the  Appellant  had
         amended his tax return before  he  made  the  ILR  application  and
         having seen and heard him give evidence which was  corroborated  by
         his wife, I find that  the  Appellant  was  not  dishonest  in  his
         dealings  with  HMRC  or  the  UKVA  with  regard  to  his  Tier  1
         application in December 2010 and his tax returns year ending  April
         2011".

16. I find that in the judge's approach to the tax return  for  2010/11  he
    has taken the correct approach to the evidence in accordance  with  the
    guidance in Khan as set out above and reached findings open to  him  on
    that evidence at paragraph 19.

17. The judge looked at  the  tax  return  for  the  year  ending  2013  at
    paragraphs 20 to 23.  The  judge  accepted  the  explanation  that  the
    discrepancy in relation to this period related to the way capital gains
    is dealt with  under  the  section  dealing  with  capital  gains  from
    property and investments.  The judge concluded that, if this amount  is
    taken into account, the Appellant's in the amended return  is  in  line
    with his claimed earnings on his January 2013 Tier 1 application.   The
    judge also noted at paragraph  21  that  the  first  amendment  to  the
    2012/13 tax return was with regard to  PAYE  income  on  which  he  had
    already paid tax.  The judge also accepted that the Appellant had  used
    a different set of accountants who had gone out of business.

18. At paragraph 21 the judge also noted  that  HMRC  had  not  issued  any
    penalties or initiated any proceedings against the Appellant but simply
    accepted that it was a mistake.  It is  contended  in  the  grounds  of
    appeal that the judge considered that this matter was determinative  of
    the appeal. I do not agree, in my view it is clear that  he  took  this
    factor into account along with all the other evidence.  The  judge  was
    entitled to do so.

19. At paragraph 23, having looked at all of the evidence  and  on  hearing
    and seeing the Appellant give his evidence and explain how  the  errors
    occurred and how he tried to rectify them and  taking  into  account  a
    number of references submitted by the  Appellant  with  regard  to  his
    honesty and integrity from former employers, the judge found  that  the
    Appellant has not been dishonest in his dealings with the HMRC and  the
    UKVI in relation to the January 2013 application and the  corresponding
    tax return.  In my view those conclusions were open to the judge on the
    basis of the evidence.  The judge took the  approach  outlined  in  the
    decision  of  Khan  looking  at  all  of  the  evidence  including  the
    Appellant's actions before concluding that the act  of  dishonesty  had
    not been established.

20. Looking at the substance of the decision in this case  I  am  satisfied
    that the judge approached the evidence in the proper  way.   The  judge
    did not simply accept that the accountants made a mistake.   The  judge
    accepted the explanation put forward about the accountants' mistake and
    all of the other evidence before him before concluding that  dishonesty
    has not been established in this case.  In my view the judge's decision
    was open to him on the evidence before him.
