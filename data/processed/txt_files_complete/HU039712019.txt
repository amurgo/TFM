Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms S Cunha, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Gordon Taole, sponsor


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

         1. Ms Mapogo, a citizen of Botswana, sought entry clearance as the
            fiancï¿½e of Gordon Taole, a British Citizen. The application was
            refused for reasons set out in a decision made on 22nd  January
            2019. Her appeal against that decision was heard by  First-tier
            Tribunal judge Rose and, for reasons  set  out  in  a  decision
            promulgated on 11 September 2019, allowed.


         2. The Secretary of State sought and  was  granted  permission  to
            appeal that decision. The Secretary of  State  sought,  in  her
            grounds, to rely on the sponsor's ex-wife's  conduct  and  that
            the sponsor had previously sponsored 5 other  women  for  entry
            clearance as adversely impacting upon the credibility  findings
            made by the First-tier Tribunal judge.

         3. Ms Cunha readily accepted that the assertion by  the  Secretary
            of State that the sponsor had previously sponsored  five  other
            women had  not  been  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge.
            Although she submitted that evidence to that  effect  could  be
            relied upon in the error of law hearing, she could  provide  no
            jurisprudence to support that submission - and in any  event  I
            note that other than assertion in the grounds, no  evidence  of
            such applications was provided.

         4. In the absence of evidence, or  indeed  assertion,  before  the
            First-tier Tribunal  judge  that  the  sponsor  had  previously
            unsuccessfully sponsored five other applications, there  is  no
            error of law by the First-tier Tribunal  judge  in  failing  to
            take such matters into account.

         5. The grounds relied upon by the respondent also  submitted  that
            the behaviour of the sponsor was such as should  have  impacted
            upon the credibility findings made by the  judge.  In  granting
            permission, the Secretary of State was directed  to  provide  a
            witness statement by the Presenting Officer if it was  intended
            to rely upon that behaviour. No witness statement was provided,
            and it was by  no  means  clear  from  the  'Minute'  that  was
            provided by the Secretary of State  that  any  discussion  that
            took place between the sponsor and the Presenting Officer  took
            place in front of the judge. It would seem odd for a Presenting
            Officer to reassure a sponsor that the judge would be fair,  in
            front of the judge. There is no merit in  that  ground  and  Ms
            Cunha did not seek to rely upon it.

         6. The Entry Clearance Officer in the reasons for  refusing  entry
            clearance had referred to one previous application sponsored by
            Mr Taole for a wife to come to the  UK.  That  application  had
            been granted but the wife had  then,  very  shortly  after  her
            entry to the UK, left the sponsor  and  they  had  subsequently
            divorced. The submission was that the judge, although assessing
            the credibility of the sponsor had failed to  make  credibility
            or other findings with adequate reasons on the intentions of Ms
            Mapogo.

         7. The judge  specifically  addressed  the  issue  of  Mr  Taole's
            previous wife and the impact upon Ms Mapogo's  application  and
            appeal. The judge considered the documentary and oral  evidence
            and in particular the evidence given by Mr Taole as to  why  he
            considered Ms Mapogo was not attempting to use her relationship
            with him to gain entry to the  UK.  The  judge  considered  the
            evidence of  contact  between  the  couple  and  gave  detailed
            reasons why he found no bad faith on the part  of  the  sponsor
            and accepted his evidence as it reflected upon  the  intentions
            of Ms Mapogo. The judge gave adequate reasons for his findings.

         8. There is no identified error of law  in  the  decision  by  the
            First-tier Tribunal to allow the appeal.



          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

     I do not set  aside  the  decision;  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal stands.
