                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr N Paramjorthy, counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. Mr Bhagat's appeal against a decision of  the  respondent  revoking
         his residence card was dismissed on the papers  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal with no appearance by either party.

      2. It was agreed by  both  parties  before  me  that  there  had  been
         administrative problems with the service of the Notice  of  hearing
         and the proper course  was  for  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal to be set aside and the appeal remitted to the  First-tier
         Tribunal for full hearing, no findings preserved.

      3. I therefore set aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         promulgated on 16th June 2016 and remit the appeal to be  heard  at
         Hatton Cross before any judge other than  First-tier  Tribunal  AJM
         Baldwin.

      4. It is to  be  noted  that  the  address  of  counsel  is  Mansfield
         Chambers, [~] and the address of the appellant is [~].




    Conclusions:

    I set aside the  decision  and  remit  the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.


                                    Date 10th November 2016
