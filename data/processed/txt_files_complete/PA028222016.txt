For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent refused the appellant's protection claim by  a  decision
    dated 11 March 2016.  First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Mozolowski  dismissed
    his appeal by a decision promulgated on 17 May 2017.  The appeal to the
    UT is on these grounds (lightly edited):

      (1) ... the tribunal failed to explain why the findings  made  by  the
      author of the Medical Foundation report in relation to the appellant's
      inconsistencies have been disregarded. At paragraph 43,  the  tribunal
      does not accept that the mental health issues would have such a marked
      impact on the appellant's narrative.  At  paragraph  86,  the  Medical
      Foundation report concludes that inconsistencies could  be  attributed
      to the mental health of the appellant.  Reference is made to the  case
      law lodged on behalf of the appellant ...

      (2) The tribunal  reached  findings  for  which  there  is  no  or  an
      insufficient evidential basis:

      (i) The tribunal finds at paragraph 37 that Daesh would be unlikely to
      use airguns when guarding and interrogating people they perceive to be
      traitors ... this finding was not supported by evidence.

      (ii) The tribunal finds at paragraph 36 that it  was  not  credible...
      that the appellant would leave his  sisters  behind...  and  that  his
      sisters could have accompanied him to Turkey. There is  no  basis  for
      either of these findings ... It is very common for asylum  seekers  to
      flee ... even when this leaves family members at risk.

      (iii) The tribunal finds at paragraph 46  that  Daesh  is  becoming  a
      spent force. The respondent accepted that  Mosul  continues  to  be  a
      contested area.

      (iv) The tribunal finds at paragraph 53 a likelihood there would be  a
      record of the passport issued to the appellant. In the same  paragraph
      the tribunal finds it was not clear if a CSID could be  obtained  from
      the appellant. This is contrary to the position of the  respondent  in
      the reasons for  refusal  letter  ...  The  respondent  concedes  that
      removal is not currently feasible ... If removal  to  Baghdad  is  not
      currently feasible, removal to the IKR cannot be feasible.

 2. In  course  of  submissions,  Mr  Matthews  conceded  that  ground  (1)
    discloses error of law.

 3. That concession was fairly and correctly made.  Although  the  decision
    of the FtT deals with the Medical Foundation in some detail, Mr  Winter
    demonstrated significant flaws.  The Judge thought that the report  did
    not consider other  possible  reasons  for  the  appellant's  condition
    (decision,  �60)  when  it  did  (report,  �69).   She  attached   high
    significance to the appellant's  judgement  that  he  did  not  require
    treatment and declined it (decision �42, 59, 61) but did  not  consider
    the possibility of that confirming rather than  denying  his  diagnosis
    (report, �68).  She did not deal with the extent to  which  the  report
    was based on objective examination rather than  self-reporting  (�51  -
    57) and its consideration of the possibility of fabrication (�78).

 4. The judge rejected the diagnosis (�60), which she was entitled  to  do,
    but did not give clear and sustainable reasons which engaged adequately
    with the terms of the report.  That undermines her finding that  mental
    health issues did not impact upon inconsistencies  in  the  appellant's
    evidence (�43).

 5. It was agreed that ground (1) led to a re-hearing.

 6. Ground (2) at (i), (ii) and (iii) in my opinion amounts to no more than
    disagreement.   The  matter  at  (2)  (iv)  remains  contentious.    As
    rehearing is required, its further resolution  must  begin  with  clear
    findings on what the appellant establishes, or fails to  establish,  by
    his evidence.

 7.  The decision of the FtT is set aside. None  of  its  findings  are  to
    stand, other than as a record of what was said  at  the  hearing.   The
    nature of the case is such that it is appropriate in terms  of  section
    12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice Statement 7.2 to remit  the
    case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.  The  member(s)  of  the
    FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include Judge Mozolowski.
