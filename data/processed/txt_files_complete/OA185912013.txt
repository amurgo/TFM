                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant born on 24th September 1982 is a citizen of Albania.  She
    had made application for entry clearance to the United Kingdom  as  the
    spouse of a British national but that application had been  refused  by
    the Respondent on 23rd September 2013.

 2. The Appellant had appealed and that  appeal  was  heard  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Fabbro on 20th August 2014 and he had allowed the appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.  The Respondent had sought application  to
    appeal that decision and permission to appeal was granted by First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Fisher on 5th December 2014.  The matter came before me
    firstly to decide whether an error  of  law  had  been  made  and  that
    hearing took place at Field House on 23rd January  2015.   For  reasons
    provided in a decision promulgated on 6th  February  2015  I  found  an
    error of law had been made by the judge and set aside the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal and directions were provided in respect of that
    rehearing.  The matter comes back before me in  accordance  with  those
    directions.

The Proceedings - Introduction

 3. As the Sponsor was present I firstly explained to him the nature of the
    proceedings and the way they would be conducted.  I  next  checked  the
    documents that were available before me in  accordance  with  both  the
    Respondent and Appellant's documentation submitted.

 4. At the outset of the hearing Mr Richardson on behalf of  the  Appellant
    conceded that the Appellant could not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules in particular FM-SE which was the  basis  upon  which
    the matter had been set  down  for  remaking  in  the  first  instance.
    However he said that the matter needed to be considered under Article 8
    of the ECHR as that had  been  pleaded  originally  and  had  not  been
    decided by the First-tier Tribunal Judge  on  the  basis  that  he  had
    allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.  I accepted  that  that
    was an appropriate method of dealing with the case.

Evidence

 5. The Sponsor was called to give  evidence  and  provided  his  name  and
    address as on file.  He confirmed his witness statement of  4th  August
    2014 was true and correct.  He referred to  a  mediation  agreement  in
    which he had contact with children and explained that during term  time
    they would come to him after school on Monday and he would return  them
    to  school  Wednesday  mornings.   He  would  also  see  them  Saturday
    mornings.  In the school holidays  they  would  generally  spend  three
    nights with him.  He lived a mile and a  half  from  their  mother  and
    their school was near his home.  He had taken them twice to Albania and
    once to Italy and on one of the trips  to  Albania  they  had  met  his
    current wife.

 6. In cross-examination he confirmed the children were aged 12 and 9 years
    old and that Mondays and Tuesdays were  effectively  his  self-employed
    days.  He said that  during  the  school  holidays  when  he  had  them
    essentially over that same period he would not work in a  self-employed
    capacity.  As a chef he said that he worked between  50  and  60  hours
    between 10am and 11pm and his time off was Monday, Tuesday and Saturday
    mornings.  There had been no need to take  the  mediation  contract  to
    court for confirmation as there were no  difficulties  between  himself
    and his ex-wife in terms of contact arrangements.

 7. In closing submissions the Respondent accepted that  there  was  family
    life with the children but referred me to the case of SS  Congo  [2015]
    EWCA Civ 387.

 8. In submissions on behalf of the Appellant it was said  that  there  had
    already been a two year separation between the Sponsor and his wife and
    I was also referred to extracts from SS Congo.

 9. At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my decision to consider the
    documents and evidence submitted.  I now provide that decision with  my
    reasons.

Decision and Reasons

10. In this case the burden of proof lies on the Appellant and the standard
    of proof required for both immigration and human  rights  issues  is  a
    balance of probabilities.

11. I confirmed that the only issue under the Immigration Rules related  to
    the income threshold and more importantly proof of that income under FM-
    SE.

12. As noted above it was accepted  by  Mr  Richardson  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant that he was unable to produce  the  documentary  evidence  as
    required under FM-SE to prove the self-employed income that he  claimed
    to receive as a painter.  That income in the relevant period  was  said
    to be �1,400 which took his total income from �17,576 in respect of his
    main job to a total of income of �18,976.

13. Mr Richardson therefore referred me to Article 8 of the ECHR  as  being
    the sole basis upon which the case was put.  The Appellant had referred
    to Article 8 of the ECHR within his Grounds of Appeal to the First-tier
    Tribunal and again as mentioned above it had not been dealt with by the
    First-tier Tribunal originally because the judge had allowed  the  case
    under the Immigration Rules.  It is in my  view  necessary  for  me  to
    consider Article 8 of  the  ECHR  outside  of  the  Rules  if  such  is
    applicable.

14. The Immigration Rules  within  this  field  of  Appendix  FM  and  more
    importantly FM-SE do not contain a discretionary element, an individual
    either meets the strict requirements by  production  of  the  necessary
    documents or does not.

15. Whilst it is understandable that a system is put in place that requires
    strict proof and essentially operates as  a  "tick  box"  or  checklist
    system, such a system does  not  have  the  personal  or  discretionary
    examination that seems to be required under Strasbourg legislation.

16. The Sponsor has produced evidence both in  documentary  form  and  oral
    evidence on key features of this case which I accept  as  credible.   I
    have not found at any stage when applying the appropriate  standard  of
    proof that I have had concerns as to his veracity.   The  key  features
    that emerge from that evidence can be summarised as follows:

      i) His income level can be properly described as a  "near  miss".   He
         has main employment as a chef  which  provides  an  income  at  the
         relevant time of �17,576.25.  He further earns �1,400 per annum  as
         a self-employed painter and decorator.  Whilst I do not suggest  he
         does not earn such monies, on his own admission he  cannot  produce
         the required documentation to prove  such  under  FM-SE.   I  would
         remark however that he did declare such income as noted at page 178
         of the Appellant's bundle within his accountant's documents.  It is
         not a case therefore where he has on the face of it never  declared
         such income or has no proof  whatsoever  of  such  claimed  income.
         Hence his total income in the relevant  period  was  �18,976  which
         placed him above the threshold income level.  It is fair  to  state
         therefore that this is an example of a "near miss" case perhaps  as
         close to the threshold as could be made.

     ii) The Sponsor has two children aged 12 and 9 years  from  a  previous
         marriage, both of whom  are  British  citizens.   The  Sponsor  has
         produced evidence demonstrating regular contact with those children
         at times that I accept as being credible.  In summary he sees  them
         Monday afternoon until 9am Wednesday morning  during  school  terms
         and Monday to Wednesday during  holidays.   He  further  sees  them
         Saturday mornings.  He has permission and has taken those  children
         abroad.  He has taken them twice to  Albania  and  once  to  Italy.
         They met the Appellant on one trip to Albania.  If the Sponsor left
         the UK for any significant period to be with the Appellant he would
         not see his children nor would it  be  realistic  to  suggest  they
         could relocate to Albania with him, given they are  at  school,  UK
         citizens and of course have substantial contact with  their  mother
         who has responsibility for them.

17. I have looked at this case and those two factors in particular in light
    of the decision in SS Congo [2015] EWCA Civ 387.  This is at  the  time
    of writing the most recent decision on what is a vexed issue  regarding
    the relationship between the new Immigration Rules and Article 8 of the
    ECHR and applicable tests.

18. Firstly I note paragraph 24 of SS  Congo  where  the  court  said  "the
    minimum income and other requirements of the leave to enter Rules could
    not be characterised as irrational,  inherently  unjust  or  inherently
    unfair."  At paragraph 25 the court continued:

         "Contrary to Blake's analysis there will generally be no or only  a
         relatively  small  gap  between  the  leave  to  enter   Rules   as
         promulgated and the requirements of Article 8 in individual  cases,
         including those Sponsors who are British citizens".

    At paragraph 26 the court stated:

         "In our judgment it clearly is possible to imagine that  there  may
         be some cases in which leave to enter  is  applied  for  where  the
         requirements of the Rules are not met but where  the  circumstances
         of the individual case have such force in Article 8 terms that  the
         Secretary of State would be obliged to grant leave to enter outside
         the Rules, in the exercise of her residual discretion".

19. At paragraph 29 the court continued "it  is  clear  therefore  that  it
    cannot be maintained as a  general  proposition  that  leave  to  enter
    outside the Immigration Rules should only  be  granted  in  exceptional
    cases".  The court then identified those type of cases where  case  law
    indicated that the test should be one of  exceptionality  referring  in
    particular to deportation cases and applications for  leave  to  remain
    where the individual's status  was  precarious  and  no  children  were
    involved.

20. At paragraph 33 the court stated:

         "It is accurate to say that the general  position  outside  of  the
         sorts of special contexts referred  to  above  is  that  compelling
         circumstances would need to be identified to support  a  claim  for
         grant of leave to remain outside the new Rules in Appendix FM".

    At paragraph 37 the court stated:

         "On the other hand  if  someone  from  the  UK  marries  a  foreign
         national or establishes a family life with them  at  a  stage  when
         they are contemplating trying to live together in the UK, but  when
         they know that their partner does not have a right to  come  there,
         the relationship will have been formed under  conditions  of  known
         precariousness.  In that sort of case it  will  be  appropriate  to
         apply a similar test of exceptional circumstance before a violation
         of Article 8 will be found to arise in  respect  to  a  refusal  to
         grant leave to enter".

21. At paragraph 38 it was said:

         "Secondly however what is in issue in relation to applications  for
         leave to enter is more in the nature of an appeal  to  the  state's
         positive obligations under Article 8.  This means the  requirements
         upon the state under Article 8 are less stringent in the  leave  to
         enter context than in the leave to remain context".

22. At paragraph 39(iii) the court referred to a range of factors that  the
    state authorities could have regard to in terms of admissibility.   The
    factors referred to in paragraph 39(iii) are not an exhaustive list but
    flag up the type of factors that would diminish the need of  the  state
    to have a positive obligation to promote family life if by so doing the
    state as a whole suffers.

23. Paragraph 39(iv) raises, inevitably the  interests  of  a  child.   The
    context in which it is raised does not make it clear whether  reference
    is being made to a child applicant  for  leave  to  enter  or  a  child
    indirectly affected by refusal of leave to enter to  another.   In  the
    case before me the child ingredient is not significantly  strong  given
    the children in question are not applying for leave to enter,  are  not
    related to the Appellant and have met up once directly.   In  terms  of
    positive promotion of family life under leave to enter the children are
    not too significant.  Their significance enters the arena if there is a
    suggestion that the Sponsor could reasonably  relocate  to  Albania  to
    continue family life with the Appellant.  If alone he  could  certainly
    do so, with the children it is somewhat unrealistic as a medium or long
    term solution.

24. Paragraph 40 summarises the position that applies in this case with the
    court stating "in our view the appropriate general formulation for this
    category is that such cases will arise where an applicant for leave  to
    enter can show that compelling circumstances exist to require the grant
    of such leave".

25. I find, whilst  it  is  a  reasonably  fine  balance,  that  there  are
    compelling circumstances in this case.  It is the  combination  of  the
    "near miss" and in that respect I refer to my analysis  of  that  above
    and also paragraph 56 of SS Congo where  reference  was  made  to  such
    matters.  The second feature is the family life that the Sponsor enjoys
    with his children in the UK on the one hand  and  the  family  life  he
    wishes to develop and promote with his wife that has been  ongoing  for
    some two years.  It is the fact the  Sponsor  essentially  must  choose
    between the children or his wife because the circumstances do not  make
    both concurrently compatible that provides the additional factor.   The
    combination of those  two  features  and  the  strength  of  those  two
    features provides a sufficiency of material to  say  that  in  my  view
    there are compelling circumstances that would require an examination of
    this case outside of the Immigration Rules.

26. Any such analysis outside  of  the  Immigration  Rules  is  essentially
    conducted using the five stage test set out in Razgar and in this  case
    as indeed with many cases one arrives fairly swiftly at the fifth stage
    test of Razgar which is a test of proportionality.  It  is  also  right
    that upon an analysis of Article 8 outside  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    that a Tribunal is bound to take account of all aspects of Section 117B
    of the 2002 Act as indicated in the case of Dube [2015].  I have  found
    for reasons provided above that on an analysis of the evidence in  this
    case it would in my view be a disproportionate interference  to  refuse
    entry clearance to the Appellant.  I have considered the obvious  point
    that as the only factor within the Immigration Rules that went  against
    the Sponsor was his failure to produce documents to support  his  self-
    employed income, it would be open to the  Appellant  to  make  a  fresh
    application after waiting for about a twelve month period during  which
    time the Sponsor  would  have  the  opportunity  of  verifying  through
    documents that portion of his income.  That is one factor that does not
    make this a case where it could be argued refusal of entry clearance is
    significantly disproportionate but applying the  appropriate  test  and
    for reasons outlined I find that a refusal of entry clearance would  be
    disproportionate and accordingly  allow  this  appeal  outside  of  the
    Immigration Rules under the provisions of Article 8 of the ECHR.
