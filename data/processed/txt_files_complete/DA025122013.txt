Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Keelin McCarthy


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant was born on 28th March, 1986 and is a citizen of Poland.

2.   On 16th October, 2012  he  pleaded  guilty  to  and  was  convicted  of
    causing criminal damage by Camberwell Magistrates' Court  and  on  13th
    December, 2012 he was sentenced by His Honour Judge R Chapple at  Inner
    London Crown Court to two years' imprisonment.

3.   The appellant first arrived in the United Kingdom in February, 2009  to
    live, work and  study  and  build  professional  connections.   He  had
    previously obtained an arts degree in Poland.

4.   Following his conviction the respondent  believed  that  the  appellant
    would pose a genuine, present and sufficiently serious  threat  to  the
    interests of public policy were he to  be  allowed  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom and concluded that his deportation was  justified  under
    Regulation 21 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006.  The respondent  concluded  that  under  Regulation  19(3)(b)  he
    should be removed and made an order in accordance with Regulation 24(3)
    requiring him to leave the United Kingdom and prohibiting him from  re-
    entering while the order was in force.

5.   The appellant appealed the respondent's decision  and  his  appeal  was
    heard by a panel of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge M  P  Keane  sitting
    with Judge S J Clarke).

6.   The panel very clearly took some considerable time and effort over  the
    appeal and in their  determination,  promulgated  on  8th  June,  2015,
    allowed his appeal.

7.   Curiously, in paragraph 44 of their determination, the panel said  that
    they allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules and "human rights".
     However, it is clear from paragraphs 42 and 43 (see  below)  that  the
    panel actually allowed the appeal under the 2006 Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the Regulations").

8.   Dissatisfied with  that  decision,  the  respondent  submitted  lengthy
    grounds of appeal.  Those grounds of appeal are  set  out  in  full  at
    Appendix A of this determination.

9.   Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Archer granted permission to  appeal  on  7
    September, 2015 and in doing so said this:-

         "I find that it is arguable that the First-tier  Tribunal  did  not
         make findings  in  relation  to  key  issues  arising  from  cross-
         examination, the police and prison evidence  and  the  pre-sentence
         and OASys Reports (paragraphs 9 - 19 of the grounds).  In addition,
         the decision incorrectly states at paragraph 30 that the  appellant
         was released in February 2012 and at paragraph  44  the  appeal  is
         incorrectly allowed under the  Immigration  Rules.   Permission  is
         granted on all grounds."

10.  As paragraph 1 of the grounds suggests, the  date  of  the  appellant's
    plea and sentence was 2012, not 2013.  This is an unfortunate error but
    I do not believe that it is in any way material to the outcome  of  the
    appeal.  Mr Jarvis argued that it was  material  but  for  the  reasons
    which follow below, I am satisfied that it was not.

11.  I believe that the error was in fact a typing error.

12.  In respect of the first ground Mr Jarvis suggested  that  at  paragraph
    30 the panel made an error by concluding that the  appellant  had  been
    exercising his treaty rights since his release from prison in 2012.  He
    argues that the appellant was in fact not released until 2014 and  this
    is material because  of  the  period  of  time  since  the  appellant's
    release.  However, it is clear from the determination  that  the  judge
    did very clearly take careful note of the judge's  sentencing  remarks.
    They were aware  that  he  was  sentenced  to  a  term  of  two  years'
    imprisonment.  They also had regard to the  NOMS1  assessment  and  the
    presentence report of 6th December, 2012 and also for the  respondent's
    letter of 6th December, 2013 ("the reasons for deportation letter")  as
    well as the appellant's bundle which in various places  refers  to  the
    appellant's release from prison.  For example, at paragraph 29  of  the
    appellant's statement on page 5 of his bundle the appellant  starts  to
    give details of his work history  since  leaving  prison  in  February,
    2014.  On page 11 of the appellant's  bundle  in  paragraph  3  of  his
    statement Mr Che Jeffrey speaks of  only  having  known  the  appellant
    since his release from prison in February, 2014 and at pages 38 and  39
    is a copy of an article written  by  the  appellant  for  The  Guardian
    newspaper published on 15th May, 2014 in  which  he  refers  to  having
    spent a year and a half in prison.  It is clear from the  determination
    that the Tribunal have paid close attention  to  the  evidence  of  the
    witnesses and in paragraph 28 of the determination they point out  that
    they have also noted the written skeleton arguments relied on  by  each
    of the representatives.  The respondent's skeleton  argument  makes  it
    clear in the chronology in Section B that the appellant was released on
    conditional release on 11th February, 2014.

13.  Mr Jarvis suggests that a material misunderstanding of  the  length  of
    time since the appellant's release lies at the  heart  of  the  alleged
    positive impact that the appellant's recent  living  circumstances  and
    work have had on his attitude towards the public and the threat that he
    poses.

14.  I do not believe that to be the case.  The Tribunal could not  possibly
    have thought that the appellant was released from custody  any  earlier
    than February, 2014 if, as they have  paid  careful  attention  to  the
    witness statements and skeleton argument as indeed they  indicate  that
    they have.  I believe  that  the  reference  in  paragraph  30  of  the
    determination to February, "2012" is again a typing error.   I  do  not
    believe that it has had any material  effect  on  the  outcome  of  the
    decision.  Counsel suggested that the error in the date referred to  in
    ground 1 was a typing error and I agree with her.

15.  The second challenge suggests that the panel's approach  to  the  legal
    questions at stake was confused.  Mr Jarvis pointed out that the appeal
    was purported to be allowed by reference to the Immigration  Rules  and
    human rights although neither was raised by the appellant.   He  points
    out that the  First-tier  Tribunal  specifically  limit  themselves  to
    allowing the appeal on the basis that the appellant  does  not  pose  a
    "sufficiently serious threat to the interests of  public  policy".   He
    pointed out that there were no findings made by the  panel  to  justify
    the conclusion that the appellant  did  not  represent  a  sufficiently
    serious threat and that was a material error of law.

16.   As  Counsel  suggested,  a  close  examination  of  the  determination
    discloses that the panel were not confused at all.

17.  At paragraph 33 the Tribunal remind themselves of  Regulation  21(5)(e)
    and considered, as they were invited to  by  Mr  Jarvis,  who  appeared
    before the First-tier Tribunal as well as before  me,  to  R  v  Pierre
    Bouchereau [1977] EUECJ R-30/77 and noted the reference by the court at
    paragraph 27 to  the  provisions  of  Article  3(2)  of  the  Directive
    2004/38.  They also note  in  paragraph  28  which  suggests  that  the
    existence of previous criminal  convictions  can  only  be  taken  into
    account insofar as the circumstances which gave rise to that conviction
    are evidence of personal conduct constituting a present threat  to  the
    requirements of public policy.  They noted Mr Jarvis' submissions  that
    the appellant had  not  told  the  truth  and  had  given  inconsistent
    accounts to the Prison Service.  Mr Jarvis pointed out to the  Tribunal
    that the appellant had  not  shown  credible  evidence  of  remorse  or
    changed his associations.   Reliance  was  placed  on  Twitter  account
    evidence but the Tribunal make it  clear  at  paragraph  34  that  they
    accepted the explanation given by the appellant of what he had said  to
    the Prison Service and the testimony of  one  of  his  witnesses,  Miss
    Piottrowska, regarding the housing arrangements of the appellant.

18.  At paragraph 35 of the determination they took  account  fully  of  the
    very serious nature of the offence.  The appellant had caused  criminal
    damage to a painting worth between  �5,000,000  and  �9,000,000  having
    entered the Tate Modern Gallery  with  the  premeditated  intention  of
    damaging a painting.  He took with him pen and ink which he applied  to
    the  canvas  of  Mark  Rothko  having  written  "Vladimir  Umainets,  A
    Potential Piece of Yellowism".  They noted that  the  sentencing  judge
    took the diminution in value as being  �1,000,000,  being  20%  of  the
    lower valuation of �5,000,000 on which  the  appellant  was  sentenced.
    They noted that restoration of the  painting  had  been  undertaken  at
    considerable cost and that now a proximity allowance had been installed
    at an additional cost of some �6,000 a year.

19.  The panel record at paragraph 38 of their determination that they  were
    impressed by the evidence of Mr Joffrey, who is also an artist and uses
    the same agent as the  appellant.   Mr  Joffrey  was  appalled  at  the
    commission of the offence and stated that his view represents  that  of
    the London artistic  community.   He  does  not  know  anyone  who  has
    condoned what the appellant had said.  Mr Joffrey is not  a  member  of
    the yellowist movement and made it clear that it has nothing to do with
    vandalism.  A website he was referred to is apparently a "spoof site".

20.  Mr Joffrey expressed the opinion that it was 100% not likely  that  the
    appellant would ever undertake a similar action  in  the  future.   The
    appellant had lived with Mr Joffrey in his own  home  for  a  year  now
    during which time they had met every day  and  had  daily  discussions.
    Even on an intellectual  level  the  appellant  would  not  commit  the
    offence again.  At paragraph 39 the Tribunal make it  clear  that  they
    place no weight on the Twitter accounts, which had nothing to  do  with
    the appellant.  The police officer who gave evidence made it clear that
    no investigation was carried out as to who was using the  accounts  and
    none of the websites with which this appellant was directly  associated
    support or promote attacks on art in any way.

21.  I believe that those findings do justify the  panel's  conclusion  that
    the appellant does not represent a sufficiently serious threat.

22.  The third challenge suggests that the findings which the Tribunal  made
    ignore the fact that the "@freeyellowism" Twitter account was owned  by
    the appellant's own agent.  The challenge suggests that  there  was  no
    evidence from or  attendance  by  the  appellant's  fellow  founder  of
    yellowism, Marcin Lodyga, nor the appellant's agent,  two  people  with
    whom the appellant is still involved and who  represent  the  "artistic
    milieu that the appellant would immerse himself into again".

23.  Ground 3 asserts that the panel failed  lawfully  to  engage  with  the
    prime part of the respondent's case, namely that the associations  with
    the appellant prior to his criminal  offence  from  which  both  Marcin
    Lodyga and Cheryl Tulloch (the appellant's agent) derive  some  benefit
    through infamy and press attention are still his associations  now  and
    in the absence of any contemporary evidence from either of them it  was
    a highly material matter.

24.  There was no evidence before the panel that the  appellant'  associates
    Marcin Lodyga  and  Cheryl  Tulloch  in  any  way  conspired  with  the
    appellant in the commission of the offence or encouraged it  or  indeed
    that they condoned it.  Cheryl Tulloch is an artistic  agent  and  also
    acts as an agent for Mr Jeffrey.  The appellant himself  says  that  he
    has  little  contact  with  Marcin  Lodyga  or  Cheryl  Tulloch.    The
    "yellowism movement" does not, as far as I understand it, suggest  that
    our great works of art should be damaged.

25.  I have concluded that ground 3 does not disclose any material error  of
    law on the part of the Tribunal.

26.  The fourth challenge suggests that it  was  plainly  unlawful  for  the
    First-tier Tribunal to find that the respondent had not discharged  the
    burden in respect of the police evidence.  The grounds assert that  the
    First-tier Tribunal misunderstood or unlawfully  ignored  evidence.   I
    have to say that I find there to be no merit at all in  this  challenge
    either.  At paragraphs 40 to 43 the panel said this:-

         "40. We accept that the letter written  by  the  appellant  to  The
             Guardian newspaper and published by them on 15  May  2014  and
             found  at  pages  38  to  39  of  the  appellant's  bundle  is
             unambiguous.  The appellant repeats how it was wrong to deface
             the work of Rothko and it was a  mistake.   He  shows  insight
             into the consequences  of  his  vandalism  because  it  heaped
             ridicule upon him and turned  the  public  against  yellowism.
             The appellant acknowledges that the British public  paid  huge
             restoration costs.  The  appellant  understands  that  he  may
             write articles as a medium to comment upon the  current  state
             of the art world.  The article ends with  an  apology  to  the
             Rothko family, to art enthusiasts and the British  public  and
             he  is  pleased  the  restoration  project  has  finished  and
             visitors can enjoy the Rothko masterpiece again.

         41.  It was  submitted  by  Mr  Jarvis  that  the  appellant  never
             challenged the NOMS as containing inaccurate  evidence  before
             the hearing itself.  The appellant's evidence has changed  and
             there are only two  witnesses  at  the  hearing  itself.   The
             respondent also relies upon the inconsistent answers given  by
             the appellant to the offender manager.  The appellant explains
             that this resulted from a misunderstanding  at  the  interview
             and we accept that he did not commit the offence in  order  to
             be housed.  We find it implausible for the appellant  to  have
             committed the offence to obtain housing benefit because of the
             likelihood of imprisonment.   The  explanation  given  by  the
             appellant at the time of the offence was that he was making an
             artistic statement and we accept this was the reason  for  his
             actions, and it was not to obtain housing benefits.   We  note
             in any event that  the  appellant  is  in  receipt  of  stable
             housing.

         42.  It was submitted by Mr Jarvis that even taken  at  its  lowest
             i.e.  a  low  risk  of  reoffending  of  17%  because  of  the
             seriousness of the  risk  involved  is  very  high.   We  were
             referred to the case of JZ (Colombia) v Secretary of State for
             the Home Department [2008] EWCA Civ 517.  That case concerns a
             non-EEA national and the  decision  to  deport  under  Article
             33(2) of the Refugee Convention.  Tuckey  LJ  emphasised  that
             whether an appellant remains a 'danger to the community' is  a
             question of fact and the word 'danger' permits the  conclusion
             that although the risk may be low  it  is  of  something  very
             serious.  We have taken this  into  account  when  considering
             whether the appellant poses a sufficiently serious  threat  to
             the interests of public policy.

         43.  We note that the appellant is living in a  stable  arrangement
             with Mr Joffey and he has  the  support  of  the  witness  Ana
             Piotrowska.  The appellant is continuing to work for the  same
             restaurant.  We accept his remorse.  We have not placed weight
             upon the Twitter accounts which have  not  been  shown  to  be
             linked to the appellant.  When looking at the evidence  relied
             upon by the respondent we do not conclude that the  burden  of
             proof has been discharged,  and  we  find  that  the  evidence
             advanced on behalf of the appellant  permits  us  to  conclude
             that he does not pose a sufficiently  serious  threat  to  the
             interests of public policy."

27.  The appellant cannot be held  responsible  for  the  actions  of  other
    individuals and, in any event, there was no evidence before  the  panel
    that Marcin Lodyga or Cheryl Tulloch  have  any  criminal  convictions.
    The panel noted at paragraphs 40 and 43 of  their  determination,  that
    the appellant has completely distanced himself from yellowism and there
    was simply no evidence of there having  been  any  similar  attacks  on
    works of art since.  Neither of the witnesses were available to  attend
    the hearing before the panel and the appellant made  it  clear  in  his
    statement that he has not seen either regularly.

28.  In respect of the fifth challenge, I deal first with the fact that  the
    appellant contributed work while he was in HM Prison  Maidstone  to  an
    art show which advertised itself  with  reference  to  the  appellant's
    criminal  damage.   As  Counsel  pointed  out,  the  appellant  had  no
    responsibility for the publicity of the exhibition; at the time he  was
    serving his sentence in HMP Maidstone.  He merely contributed  a  piece
    of his work.  It was not shown whether  or  not  the  appellant  became
    aware of the publicity material during the  art  show  but  he  had  no
    influence over it at all.  Again, I do not believe that this  discloses
    any error on a point of law.  It might  have  been  different  had  the
    respondent been in a position to demonstrate that the appellant had  in
    some way been responsible  for  the  publicity  material  used  by  the
    exhibition but that was not the case.

29.  With regard to the presentence report I believe that paragraphs 40  and
    41 deal with the issues raised.  The panel were entitled to examine all
    the evidence and  take  a  view  on  the  overall  risk  posed  by  the
    appellant.  They were clearly impressed by his article written for  The
    Guardian  and  his  acknowledgement  as  to  the  consequences  of  his
    vandalism.  The comments made in the NOMS report were explained by  the
    appellant as resulting from a misunderstanding of the interview and the
    panel accepted this.  In any event they were entitled to find  as  they
    did.

30.  I do not believe that the panel of the  First-tier  Tribunal  made  any
    material error of law in its determination and I therefore uphold it.

Notice of Decision

The appellant's appeal is allowed under the Immigration  (European  Economic
Area) Regulations 2006.
