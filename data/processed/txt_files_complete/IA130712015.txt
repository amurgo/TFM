Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr R Ahmed, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr J McGirr, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines who was born on 23 August
    1976 who applied for leave  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  under
    Appendix FM and on the basis of her private and family life outside the
    Immigration Rules.  The respondent refused her application on 17  March
    2015 and she appealed.  In a decision promulgated on 10  December  2015
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Farmer dismissed her appeal under both
    the Immigration Rules and under Article 8 of the European Convention on
    Human Rights.

 2. The appellant sought permission to appeal which was granted by Judge of
    the First-tier Tribunal Frankish on 24 May 2016.  His  reasons  for  so
    doing are:-

         "1.  In a decision promulgated on 10  December  2015  F-tTJ  Farmer
             dismissed an appeal, having  entered  as  a  student,  against
             refusal of leave to remain under FM or article 8 by reason  of
             not qualifying.

         2.   The application for permission to appeal asserts that, a  lack
             of English language certificate being the only objection,  and
             the F-tTJ finding for the appellant on this point, the  appeal
             should have been allowed under the partner route  rather  than
             going on wrongly to consider EX.1; failed to apply Zambrano or
             IDI of August 2015 as a partner/parent of ten years  standing;
             wrong article 8 assessment per SS (Congo) and  S117(b)(6)  for
             this genuine marriage to a UK citizen  and  their  UK  citizen
             child.

         3.   Notwithstanding previous  use  of  a  false  English  language
             certificate, with a new uncontested certificate, �11 indicates
             that the appellant had done all she need  to  do  to  succeed.
             All grounds, however, are arguable."

 3. Thus the appeal came before me today.

 4. In his decision the  judge  recorded  that  since  the  making  of  the
    respondent's decision the appellant has given birth to a  baby  T  M  N
    born on 2 June 2015 who is a British citizen and that the appellant was
    in the United Kingdom with her  husband  and  child  having  married  a
    British citizen on 18 June 2014.   The  appellant  entered  the  United
    Kingdom as a student on 6 October 2006 and was granted leave to  remain
    following various applications until 29 September 2015.  Her leave  was
    curtailed by notice dated 29 August 2014 and a decision made to  remove
    her on 17 March 2015 being the decision subject to the appeal.

 5. The respondent refused the application on the basis that the  appellant
    had failed to  meet  the  suitability  requirements  because  she  used
    deception by submitting a false document in support of  an  application
    for a visa.  She cannot rely on EX.1 in support of her appeal  and  she
    failed to meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the  Immigration
    Rules as she was 30 years old when she arrived in  the  United  Kingdom
    and lived most of her life in the Philippines, where it cannot be  said
    that there are significant obstacles to  her  reintegration  into  that
    country.  Further, no compelling or  exceptional  circumstances  exists
    that merit consideration outside the Immigration Rules.

 6. The nub of this appeal is the findings of the judge at paragraph 11  of
    his decision.  It state:-

         "11. The appellant does meet the  suitability  criteria  under  the
             Immigration  Rules  Appendix  FM.   It  was  conceded  by  the
             appellant that she  did  use  deception  to  pass  an  English
             language test in 2010.  She paid in total �650 to get a  proxy
             sitter who helped her with the test.  Since that time she  has
             passed a test on her own merit (this is not  in  dispute)  and
             this result was used in support of this  application.   Having
             considered the Rules I agree with this submission by  Mr  Dias
             conclusion and  find  that  the  suitability  requirements  of
             Appendix FM S-LTR.2.2 are met.  I find this because the  false
             document was used in a previous application and whilst this is
             relevant overall to the credibility of the applicant the false
             document, from the reading of the Rules has to have been  used
             in  the  application.   It  does  not   extend   to   previous
             applications.  Therefore as this was the only matter in  issue
             under suitability I find that she does  meet  the  suitability
             criteria."

 7. The judge went on to find at paragraph 16  of  his  decision  that  the
    appellant could not take advantage of EX.1 and further  there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles to her husband joining her in the Philippines.
     Paragraph 276ADE was not pursued in the appeal.  The judge  considered
    exceptional circumstances and found that none existed.  However, he did
    go on to consider the  case  under  Article  8  on  the  basis  of  the
    existence within the factual matrix of this appeal of a British  child.
    The judge then went on to carry out an  Article  8  balancing  exercise
    subsuming within it the best interests of that child before  dismissing
    the appeal both under the Immigration Rules and on Article 8 grounds.

 8. Mr Ahmed submitted that the only issue within this appeal  was  whether
    the appellant could meet the suitability criteria under the Immigration
    Rules of Appendix FM.  Having found that those criteria  are  met  (and
    this was accepted by Mr McGirr) it was for the judge  simply  to  allow
    the appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  with  no  consideration  of
    exceptionality under Appendix  EX.1  required.   Paragraph  12  of  the
    judge's decision states:-

         "12.  Having  satisfied  myself  that  the  appellant   meets   the
             suitability criteria I went on to consider whether  she  could
             avail herself of EX.1 either as a partner or as a parent."

 9. The decision discloses an error of law as it is only necessary to  look
    at EX.1 if  the  appellant  were  unable  to  satisfy  the  suitability
    criteria.  That amounts to a material error of law.

10. He then went on to make alternative submissions relying on the  written
    grounds of appeal with particular reference to paragraph 13 where it is
    asserted that the appellant, should in any event, benefit from  EX.1(a)
    as she has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a  child  who  is
    under the age of 18 and a British citizen.  The grounds  then  referred
    to the authority of Ruiz Zambrano (EU citizen) [2011] EU ECJ  (C-34/09)
    and the respondent's own policies.

11. Mr McGirr highlighted that on his analysis the  appellant  had  made  a
    valid application which became  subject  to  the  appeal  before  Judge
    Farmer.  He was  accepting  that  the  appellant  met  the  suitability
    requirements but argued nonetheless that, contrary to the submission of
    Mr Ahmed, it was open to the judge to go on and consider EX.1.1 of  the
    Immigration Rules.  He argued that the whole of the  Immigration  Rules
    had to be met.

12. With regard to the first limb of Mr Ahmed's submissions it was accepted
    by Mr McGirr, and I find, that  this  is  an  appellant  who  met  the
    suitability requirements.

13. There is before me no cross appeal argument that  the  judge  erred  by
    failing to consider the eligibility  requirements.   Mr  McGirr  argued
    that the issue was raised within the final sentence of paragraph  3  of
    the respondent's Rule 24 notice.  It states:-

         "The grounds do not make any reference to any element of the  claim
         that was not captured by the consideration under the Rules."

14. I have considerable difficulty in understanding  the  meaning  of  this
    sentence in the context of the submissions being made,  and  Mr McGirr
    was unable to assist me further in relation thereto.   However,  I  was
    referred by Mr Ahmed to the respondent's own refusal letter of 17 March
    2015 wherein it appears that the only assertion against  the  appellant
    meeting the eligibility grounds is consequent upon her being  found  to
    be unsuitable.   It  is  important  to  note  that  the  issue  of  the
    eligibility requirements  has  never  previously  been  raised  by  the
    respondent within this appeal.

15. That being the case Mr Ahmed urged me to accept that in  light  of  the
    appellant meeting  the  suitability  requirements  and  the  respondent
    accepting that to  be  the  position,  the  appeal  should  be  allowed
    outright.

16. That is a submission that I accept.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing it.

No anonymity direction is made.
