Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Nicholson made following hearings at Manchester on 7th January 2014 and
    20th February 2014.

Background

 2. The claimants are nationals of Pakistan. The first claimant came to the
    UK on 20th June 2008 with leave to remain as a Tier 1  General  Migrant
    which was subsequently extended on 7th July 2011.  His wife  and  three
    children had leave as his dependants.

 3. Prior to the expiry of the second grant, they applied for further leave
    to remain, but were refused on 24th July 2013 because, on the  evidence
    presented to the Secretary of State, they did not show  that  they  had
    access to ï¿½3,300 for a consecutive 90 day period ending no more than 31
    days before the date of application.

 4. The judge dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules and there is
    no challenge to that aspect of his decision.

 5. He did however allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds for the  following
    reasons.

 6. In Patel and others v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72 the Supreme Court  held  that
    there was no near miss principle as such.  In this case the miss was of
    a technical nature in that the Appellants had failed to comply with the
    requirement to send in specific documents.   The  judge  was  satisfied
    that the claimants did in fact have UK bank  accounts  containing  more
    than sufficient funds to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Rules;  the
    circumstances in which they failed to comply should not be ignored.

 7. They had all been in the UK legally since 2008 and had not returned  to
    Pakistan since.  They had little to return to.  The judge said that  it
    was well-documented that the situation for Christians in Pakistan was a
    difficult one at present, although it was to the claimants' credit that
    they had not sought to seek asylum, but the general difficulties  faced
    by people of their faith in Pakistan was common knowledge.

 8. The principal claimant had built up  a  business  with  a  considerable
    income.  His wife works as a  carer.   Two  of  the  children  were  in
    education and another is hoping to go to university.   Their  education
    would be interrupted part way through and their planned future  in  the
    UK would come to an end.  They would be  returning  to  a  particularly
    difficult situation in Pakistan where the  family  home  has  been  the
    subject of dispute.

 9. The fifth claimant was under 18 and his best interests had to be  taken
    into account.  He was a Pakistani national and had  spent  the  greater
    part of his life in Pakistan and would have no language problems there.
     On the other hand he had been in the UK for almost six years, was part
    way through his education, and  his  removal  would  have  a  seriously
    adverse effect on him.

10. The judge wrote as follows

         "Set against the weight to be attached to immigration control there
         is very considerable prejudice to private life in this  case  given
         the length of time that the family have been here,  the  fact  that
         they have made this country their home, the specific  situation  of
         the younger Appellants, the likely effect of removal at  this  time
         on Mr Nayyar Zaman Malik's business and the fact that  for  one  of
         the Appellants, the child Oneil Malik, there are some factors  (not
         all) which point  towards  a  conclusion  that  his  life  lies  in
         remaining in this country."

11. He allowed the appeal.

The Grounds of Application

12. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on four grounds.

13. First, the  judge  erred  in  law  by  considering  the  situation  for
    Christians in Pakistan without evaluating the  objective  evidence  and
    applying it to the individual circumstances.  He failed to consider the
    nature  of  the  difficulties,  the  differential  impact  of  them  on
    returnees, how these claimants could  be  affected,  their  ability  to
    overcome them and the areas in which any difficulties were concentrated
    geographically.

14. Second he erred in finding that Article 8 was engaged in the  cases  of
    claimants who were in education in the UK, since they could  all  apply
    for leave to enter the UK as students if they wished.

15. Third the judge erred in his consideration of the  minor  child's  best
    interests.  He was a  mature  teenager  who  would  shortly  reach  his
    majority.  He had been in  the  UK  for  less  than  seven  years,  the
    threshold identified in paragraph 276ADE(iv) and, given that he  was  a
    Pakistani national who had lived there for the significant majority  of
    his life, the judge was wrong to find that his best interests  demanded
    that he stay in the UK.

16. Finally the judge erred in finding that private  life  was  engaged  in
    respect of the first and second  claimants,  having  failed  to  direct
    himself whether the prejudice suffered amounted to interference of such
    gravity as to engage Article 8 as per the second Razgar question.

17. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Grimmett on 26th  March  2014
    for the reasons stated in the grounds.

Submissions

18. Mrs Pettersen relied on her grounds.

19. With respect to ground 1, the difficulties for Christians  in  Pakistan
    was not pleaded before  the  judge.   Any  interruption  to  the  adult
    children's studies could be mitigated by their applying to come to  the
    UK to study.  There was no evidence of any detrimental  effect  to  the
    minor claimant by his removal to the country of  his  nationality.   In
    practice the judge had considered this to be a near miss case, since he
    had taken post application evidence into account, and that had infected
    his decision.

20. Ms Aspinall defended the determination.  The  reference  to  Christians
    had not affected the judge's consideration of  Article  8  but  in  any
    event he was entitled to consider the situation that the  family  would
    face on return to Pakistan in his  considerations  of  proportionality.
    It would be unreasonable to expect the children to have  to  apply  for
    entry clearance since they were part way through their studies.   There
    was no authority for the proposition that a child under the age of  18,
    by a few months, should not benefit from Section 55.  It was clear from
    the determination that the judge had in  fact  considered  all  of  the
    relevant Razgar questions and reached a decision open to him.

Findings and Conclusions

21. The grounds amount to a disagreement with the decision but disclose  no
    arguable error of law.

22. The judge did not found his decision on the basis  that  Christians  in
    Pakistan presently face difficult  times,  and  accordingly  there  was
    absolutely no requirement to give the level  of  detail  cited  in  the
    grounds. The comment about Christians adds little to his reasoning.  In
    any  event  the  judge  was  plainly  right  to  consider  all  of  the
    circumstances in the round, including the situation  in  Pakistan.   He
    accepted, for example, that there  had  been  a  family  dispute  which
    rendered return to the family  home  problematic,  clearly  a  relevant
    consideration for him.

23. Whilst the right to education is not a protected right as  such  within
    Article 8, the fact  that  the  adult  claimants  were  midway  through
    courses or about to embark on them was again a relevant factor for  the
    judge to consider.  He could have reached the  conclusion  that,  since
    they could apply for entry clearance to resume their  studies,  removal
    would not be disproportionate, but it  was  open  to  him  to  conclude
    otherwise, bearing in mind all of the other factors in this case.

24. There is no basis for a submission that because the sixth claimant  was
    approaching 18 his best interests should not properly be considered.

25. Finally, it is not arguable that the judge was not entitled to conclude
    that the principal Appellant and his wife did not enjoy  private/family
    life in the UK deserving of respect.  The fact that they came to the UK
    under the points-based system  does  not  undermine  their  ability  to
    establish private life here.  On the judge's  findings,  in  2008,  the
    family intended to make their life in the UK.  The principal  Appellant
    has established a business and his wife works as a care assistant.

26. In Philipson (ILR - not PBS  evidence)  India  [2012]  UKUT  00039  the
    Tribunal held


         "While the judge might well have been entitled to conclude that the
         immigration decision did not interfere with the  right  of  respect
         for family life, because  there  was  no  question  of  the  family
         members being separated, there was in  our  judgment  private  life
         established in this country when the claimant and  her  family  had
         relocated from India on the understanding and belief that  she  was
         being admitted under  a  Rule  that  would  allow  them  to  remain
         indefinitely in the  UK.   She  had  an  expectation  of  permanent
         residence in the UK if she continued to meet the conditions of  the
         work permit.  In our judgment that was a legitimate and  reasonable
         one having regard to the nature of the Rules throughout  her  stay.
         Although it was not a legal right or  an  indefeasible  expectation
         because policy  could  always  change,  we  would  normally  expect
         transitional provisions to be made  in  cases  where  a  person  is
         encouraged to leave their own country to take on  a  demanding  and
         very low paid job as a care assistant.  In our judgment, there  was
         private life  deserving  of  respect.   The  question  then  arises
         whether interference with it is proportionate and justified."

27. The same principles apply here.

28. The judge did not, as Mrs Pettersen  submitted,  apply  the  near  miss
    principle.  He was required to undertake  a  balancing  exercise.   The
    legitimate aim identified by the Secretary of State  was  the  economic
    wellbeing of the country and the  importance  of  immigration  control.
    The judge acknowledged that the failure to  meet  technical  evidential
    requirements should be accorded weight. Nevertheless the fact that  the
    claimants actually do have more  than  sufficient  funds  to  meet  the
    substantive requirements of the Rules was not an irrelevant factor  for
    him.

29. The Secretary of State's grounds amount  to  a  disagreement  with  the
    decision.

Decision

30. The judge's decision stands.  The claimants' appeals are allowed.
