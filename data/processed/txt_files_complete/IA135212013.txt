                                   Between

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent



          DECISION OF THE PRESIDENT, THE HON. MR JUSTICE McCLOSKEY

   1.     This appeal was listed for hearing before the Upper Tribunal on 08
      April 2014.  Having considered the representations of both parties, it
      was adjourned to 15 April 2014.

   2.   The appeal has its origins in a decision by the Secretary  of  State
      whereby the Appellant's application for a  residence  card  under  the
      Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 was refused.  At
      the hearing on 08 April 2014, the Secretary of State's  representative
      accepted that the FtT had erred in law in dismissing  the  Appellant's
      appeal and canvassed the possibility of withdrawing the decision.

   3.      By  letter  dated  22  April  2014,  the  Secretary  of   State's
      representative has signified a further decision whereby  the  impugned
      decision has been withdrawn.  The  consequence  is  that  it  will  be
      reconsidered and made afresh.

   4.     In these circumstances, having regard to Rule 17 of  the  Tribunal
      Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the decision  of  the  Upper
      Tribunal in SM v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2014]
      UKUT64 (IAC), the appropriate order is to  allow  the  appeal  on  the
      basis that the Secretary of  State's  original  decision  was  not  in
      accordance with the law.

   5.     This Order will become final on 09  May  2014.   If  either  party
      wishes to make any representations, they must be received before  that
      date.
