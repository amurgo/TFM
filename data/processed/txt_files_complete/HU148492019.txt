                            DECISION AND REASONS

This has been a remote hearing to which there has been no objection  by  the
parties. The form of remote hearing was Skype for business. A face  to  face
hearing was not held because it was not practicable, and  all  issues  could
be determined in a remote hearing.

The appeal comes before me following the grant of permission  to  appeal  to
the Upper Tribunal.

The appellant is a national of India, born on 16 December 1994. She  entered
the UK on 8 November 2015  with  leave  to  enter  as  the  fiancï¿½e  of  her
sponsor, Jack [C], and was subsequently granted further to leave  to  remain
as the spouse of her sponsor, valid until 16 September 2018.

On 9 August 2018 the appellant made an Article 8 application  for  leave  to
remain on the basis of her family life with her husband. On 20  August  2018
written representations were made in  support  of  the  application  by  the
appellant's legal representatives. It was explained in  the  representations
that Mr [C]'s physical and mental health had  declined  to  such  an  extent
that it was no longer possible for him and the appellant to  live  together.
Mr [C] had been diagnosed with  emotionally  unstable  personality  disorder
and persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms and,  as  a  result  of  his
condition, he was liable  to  outbursts  and  anger  or  violence.  He  also
suffered from Friedreich's Ataxia, which was a  neurological  condition.  He
had been physically and emotionally  abusive  towards  the  appellant  as  a
result of his mental health condition. The couple hoped, however,  that  the
situation would change  and  they  could  resume  living  together  and  the
appellant remained in a close relationship with the sponsor's parents.

With the application, the appellant submitted a letter  of  support  from  a
friend of herself and her husband, [AP], a psychiatric report,  a  statement
from the sponsor and his father and other supporting evidence.

The appellant's application was refused on 19 August 2019, a year later,  on
the grounds that she failed to  meet  the  eligibility  requirements  of  E-
LTRP.1.7 of Appendix FM of the immigration rules as she was no longer  in  a
subsisting relationship with Mr [C]. The respondent  noted  the  appellant's
statement in her application form that  she  and  Mr  [C]  no  longer  lived
together due to a decline in his mental and physical health and that he  had
been physically abusive towards her and had attempted suicide in  the  past.
The respondent considered that the appellant could not, therefore, meet  the
requirements of Appendix FM on the basis of family  life  and  that  neither
could she meet the private  life  requirements  in  paragraph  276ADE(1)  as
there were no very significant obstacles to her integration  in  India.  The
respondent  considered  that  the   appellant's   circumstances   were   not
sufficiently compelling to justify a grant of leave outside the  immigration
rules.

The appellant appealed that decision.  In  her  grounds  of  appeal  it  was
submitted on her behalf that she was no longer living with Mr  [C]  because,
as a result of his mental health conditions, he  had  been  abusive  towards
her to such an extent that it was impossible to continue  living  with  him.
However they continued to see each other and remained married  and  did  not
intend to separate. The appellant had spent holidays  with  his  family  and
there was a hope that  the  situation  would  improve.  The  respondent  had
failed to consider that the situation the appellant  found  herself  in  was
unique as she  remained  committed  to  the  marriage  and  was  hoping  the
situation would improve as her husband was seeking treatment for his  mental
health problems.

The appellant's appeal came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Cox  on  7
November 2019. The judge recorded the appellant's evidence before her,  that
she had met her husband when she was working in a hotel in  India  and  that
the relationship had progressed quickly, with a marriage  proposal  in  less
than a month. Her family was  not  happy  about  the  relationship  and  her
parents had tried to arrange a marriage for her when Jack  returned  to  the
UK, but she had not agreed. Jack then  returned  to  India  and  they  lived
together for some time. She did not speak to her parents during  that  time,
but she spoke to her brother a few times, when she called  him.  However  he
lived with their parents and so could not be seen to be going against  them.
The appellant described the abuse she had suffered which  culminated  in  an
incident on 11 June 2016 when she fled the house in  her  pyjamas  and  took
refuge with some people she met until she was able to return  to  the  house
after Jack had left. The judge also heard from the couple's mutual  friends,
[AP] and [JB], whose evidence  confirmed  the  appellant's  account  of  the
violence she suffered from  her  husband.  In  his  submissions  before  the
judge, the appellant's representative Mr Canter sought  to  argue  that  the
appellant fell within the domestic violence provisions  of  the  immigration
rules and that, whilst she could not meet  the  requirements  of  the  rules
themselves because she had not  made  an  application  on  that  basis,  the
appeal should be allowed outside the rules on the basis  that  the  decision
to remove her was disproportionate and in  breach  of  Article  8.  He  also
relied on paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the immigration rules.

Judge Cox did not accept that there were very significant obstacles  to  the
appellant's integration in India, as she had lived alone  previously  during
the periods when Jack had returned to the UK, there was no  indication  that
her parents would resort to violence against her and she had the support  of
her brother, Jack's parents and her friends. As for  the  domestic  violence
provisions, the judge considered that it was not  clear  from  the  evidence
before her that the violence was the reason  why  the  marriage  ended.  The
judge  noted  the  reference  to  hopes  of  reconciliation,  to  the   long
separation and to Jack's parents saying  that  the  couple  could  not  live
together at the moment. It was not clear that the marriage had  broken  down
and there was no satisfactory evidence as to when  the  relationship  ended.
The judge considered that the appellant had not provided her legal  advisers
with all the facts that were now presented and had not instructed them  that
the marriage was at an end for reasons of domestic violence, as  they  would
have known to make an application on that basis under the rules if that  was
the case. The instructions she had  given  to  her  advisers  was  that  she
remained married and did not want to separate from her  husband.  The  judge
accordingly refused to give weight to  the  submission  that  the  appellant
would  have  succeeded  in  a  domestic  violence  claim  had  she  made  an
application on that basis. She  found  that  the  appellant's  circumstances
were not exceptional and she concluded that the  respondent's  decision  was
proportionate and dismissed the appeal.

The appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  that  decision  to  the  Upper
Tribunal on the following  grounds:  that  the  judge's  finding,  that  the
appellant's marriage did not end because of domestic violence, was  contrary
to the unchallenged evidence, as it was clear that  the  relationship  ended
in June 2016 when the appellant left the marital  home,  and  therefore  the
judge's Article 8 assessment was flawed; and that the  judge  had  erred  in
law in her assessment of very significant obstacles to integration  for  the
purposes of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) and had failed to  consider  the  expert
evidence submitted.

Permission was granted by the First-tier Tribunal on 18  May  2020  and  the
matter then came before me. Both parties made submissions.

Mr Canter expanded upon the grounds. With regard to  the  first  ground,  he
submitted that, although the appellant  did  not  make  an  application  for
leave to remain on  the  basis  of  domestic  violence,  she  met  the  most
significant requirements of the relevant immigration rule, namely  that  her
marriage had broken down  permanently  because  of  the  domestic  violence.
There was copious, undisputed,  evidence  showing  that  the  appellant  had
suffered domestic violence and there was therefore no proper reason for  the
judge's finding, at [47], that it was not clear that the marriage had  ended
because of domestic violence. The judge's finding in  that  regard  amounted
to a material error of law. As for the second ground,  Mr  Canter  submitted
that the judge had erred in her findings in  relation  to  very  significant
obstacles: she had wrongly considered the time  the  appellant  lived  apart
from her family in India  as  a  comparison  in  assessing  the  appellant's
ability to live alone in India, when she had been living with Jack  some  of
the time and was living with his friend;  her  finding  that  the  appellant
would have the support of her brother was not  supported  by  the  evidence;
she had wrongly taken account of continuing financial  support  from  Jack's
parents when there was no evidence that that  support  would  continue;  and
she had found that the appellant would receive financial  support  from  her
friends in the UK without putting that to the witnesses.

Ms Everett submitted that it was not correct to say that the judge  couldn't
have found that the appellant's marriage broke down  for  any  other  reason
than domestic violence and it was open to her  to  find  that  there  was  a
possibility of reconciliation and to reach the conclusion that she  did.  Ms
Everett accepted, however, that if it was considered that  the  judge  could
only have found that the marriage broke down at the time the appellant  left
the marital home in June 2016, then  there  was  an  error  of  law  in  her
decision. As for the second ground, Ms Everett submitted that the judge  was
entitled to conclude that the evidence did not demonstrate very  significant
obstacles to integration in India.

Discussion and Findings

I am in agreement with Ms Everett that the second ground is  not  made  out.
The threshold for demonstrating very significant  obstacles  to  integration
in India is a high one and the judge  was  entitled  to  find  that  it  was
simply not met on the evidence before  her.  Indeed,  whilst  permission  to
appeal  was  granted  on  all  grounds,  the  arguable  error   specifically
identified in Judge Grant's decision was in relation to the first ground.

As for the first ground, it is  necessary  to  be  particularly  careful  to
separate my own views on the evidence from the  relevant  issue  before  me,
namely whether Judge Cox erred  in  law  and  whether  she  could  not  have
reached the decision that she did on the evidence  before  her.  Ms  Everett
readily acknowledged that that  was  a  difficult  exercise.  There  was  no
dispute that the appellant had been the victim of domestic violence and  had
suffered serious physical abuse from her husband. However,  the  reason  why
the judge concluded that the appellant did not meet  the  domestic  violence
provisions in the rules was not because she had doubts about  the  violence,
but because she did not consider it to be clear  from  the  evidence  before
her that the marriage had actually broken down  permanently.  Whilst  I  can
understand why the judge concluded as she did, given the references  in  the
evidence to hopes of reconciliation and to the appellant remaining close  to
her husband's family and remaining involved  in  details  of  his  life,  it
seems to me that ultimately the judge erred by concluding that the  evidence
did not show that the relationship had broken down permanently.

It was clear from the unchallenged  evidence  that  the  appellant  and  her
husband separated on 11 June 2016 when  she  fled  the  marital  home  after
being physically abused. It  is  also  clear  from  the  evidence  that  the
appellant and her husband had remained living apart from that  date  and  at
one point did not see each other for over a year. Where  this  case  differs
from others involving domestic violence  is  the  fact  that  the  appellant
still loved her husband and remained in contact with  him  and  his  family,
recognising that the violence arose from a mental illness over which he  had
no control and not wishing him to be  punished  for  his  behaviour  through
criminal proceedings. However that did not mean that the  marriage  had  not
broken down permanently. It seems to me that the judge's error  lay  in  her
speculation that the relationship may continue and in the  weight  she  gave
to the appellant not having put her case on that basis in  her  application.
However the latter was adequately explained by the unusual circumstances  of
the appellant's continuing connection to Jack and  her  involvement  in  his
life and with his family, and the former was simply  not  made  out  on  the
evidence of what was, by the time of the hearing, a three and  a  half  year
separation. It seems to me, therefore, that the evidence  before  the  judge
ought to have led her to accept that the  appellant's  marriage  had  broken
down as a result of the domestic violence that she  suffered  and  that  the
marriage and relationship came to a permanent end on the day  the  appellant
fled her home after being physically abused on 11 June 2016.

Ms Everett properly acknowledged that if I  concluded  that  the  judge  was
wrong to say that it was not clear  when  and  why  the  relationship  broke
down, then I must find an error of law. She also accepted that  if  such  an
error of law was found and the first ground  was  considered  to  have  been
made out, the way in which the grounds had  been  put  were  such  that  the
appeal could be allowed without a further hearing. Accordingly,  I  do  find
that the judge erred in law and I therefore set aside her decision  and  re-
make it by allowing the appeal. I do  so  on  the  basis  that,  absent  the
requirement for an application to have been made, the  requirements  of  the
immigration rules relating  to  domestic  violence  have  been  met  by  the
appellant and that, there being no  adverse  public  interest  factors,  the
respondent's decision to refuse leave to remain is disproportionate  and  in
breach of the appellant's Article 8 human rights.



DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved an  error  on
a point of law. I set aside the decision and  re-make  it  by  allowing  the
appeal on Article 8 grounds.
