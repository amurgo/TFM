Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Jarvis
For the Respondent:    Mr Ahmed


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Adio made following a hearing at Hatton  Cross  on  2nd  January  2014.
    Judge Adio allowed the Claimant's appeal under Article 8 of  the  ECHR.
    The Secretary of State sought and was granted permission to appeal that
    decision and, on 21st March 2014 Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Lewis  set
    it aside.  A copy of Judge Lewis's determination is appended.

 2. Judge Lewis directed the matter to be heard  at  Field  House  on  30th
    April 2014 before him.  However on that day it was not possible for him
    to determine it and the matter was transferred to me.  It  was  however
    adjourned because the Claimant's representative informed me that he was
    in hospital and all of the documentary evidence upon which he  intended
    to rely was in the possession of the Claimant rather  than  instructing
    solicitors.

 3. Thus it came before me on 11th June 2014.

The Hearing

 4. Usman Pervez gave brief oral evidence.  His  case  is  based  upon  his
    having been involved in a road traffic accident in the  UK  in  January
    2012.  He was knocked off his motorbike and, he says, received injuries
    which required a  mechanical  valve  replacement  in  his  heart.   The
    consequence of the operation is that he will have to take anticoagulant
    medication for the rest of his life in order  to  reduce  the  risk  of
    heart attack or stroke.  He says that his parents and  family  are  not
    wealthy and would not be able to afford the medication.   Neither  does
    Pakistan have the national healthcare system and  medication  which  he
    would need.

 5. In oral evidence he also said that  he  suffers  from  depression,  for
    which he is given medication and attends appointments with a therapist.
     He has produced a letter from his GP which confirms that the  Claimant
    consulted them recently complaining of feeling tired and depressed.

 6. So far as the affordability of medication in Pakistan is  concerned  he
    relies on a report from Dr Habib Aslam Gaba dated 3rd June  2014  which
    estimates that the "total average cost will be nearly  minimum"  95,000
    rupees per month which Mr Pervez said equated to about  �600.   He  has
    also provided a service certificate from his father's employer in Saudi
    which states that he earns 1,950 rials per  month  which  the  Claimant
    said equated to �280.  His mother does not work and his father  has  to
    pay for the education of his two sisters and brother.

 7. Even if it was affordable, the Claimant said that his life would be  at
    risk in Pakistan because of the lack of emergency services.

 8. It was pointed out to him that in his  original  application  form  the
    Claimant said that he received �400 per month  from  his  parents  from
    which he pays �200 rent.  Mr Pervez said that his father was no  longer
    sending him money and he was  dependent  upon  his  friend  Rashid  who
    supported him and who could be available to give evidence in the future
    if it was required.





Submissions

 9. Mr Jarvis submitted that the Claimant's evidence should  be  approached
    with caution given the discrepancies  between  what  was  said  in  the
    original application form and his present evidence.   His  parents  had
    given  him  �8,000  for  his  studies  in  the  UK  and  there  was  no
    corroborative evidence from them nor from Rashid as to  the  Claimant's
    present financial arrangements.   He  reminded  me  that  even  in  his
    initial appeal before Judge Adio he had not been  found  to  be  wholly
    credible because he had wrongly told the judge that  warfarin  was  not
    available in Pakistan.  He relied on the  decision  in  Akhalu  (Health
    claim; ECHR Article 8)  Nigeria  [2013]  UKUT  400  and  in  particular
    paragraph 46 of that determination which states:

         "Put another way, the consequences of removal for the health  of  a
         Claimant who would not be able to access equivalent  healthcare  in
         their country of nationality as was available in this country,  are
         plainly relevant to the  question  of  proportionality.   But  when
         weighed against the public interests in ensuring that  the  limited
         resources of this country's health service are  used  to  the  best
         effect for the benefit of those for whom they are  intended,  those
         consequences do not weigh heavily  in  the  Claimant's  favour  but
         speak cogently in support of the public interests in removal."

10. In KH (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 1354  the  Court  of  Appeal
    stated:

         "Although Mr Jacobs relied on Article 8 as well as  Article  3,  he
         realistically accepted that it would be  a  very  rare  case  which
         could succeed if it failed the Article 3 threshold."

11. Mr Ahmed submitted that the Claimant had given credible and  consistent
    evidence.  It was not implausible that the  situation  so  far  as  the
    family's  finances  were  concerned  might  have  changed   since   the
    application for further leave to remain had been  made  in  2012.   His
    parents had been able to provide financial support in the past but were
    no longer able to do so.

12. In the reasons for refusal letter the only issue taken by the Secretary
    of State was in relation to medical  treatment  in  Pakistan.   It  was
    speculative for the Presenting Officer to rely on the costs to  the  UK
    of the Claimant's treatment since there was no evidence at all of  what
    those costs would be.  He relied on the decision in Okonkwo  (Legacy  -
    Hakemi; health claim)  [2013]  UKUT  00401,  which  involved  a  kidney
    transplant, the success of which depended on the  continued  supply  of
    medication.

13. The supply of appropriate medication in Pakistan was compromised by the
    fact that, as outlined in Dr Gaba's report, the weather in Pakistan was
    hot which made the blood flow quicker  and  "it's  not  right  for  any
    mechanical  valve  patient".   Furthermore  there  was  the   risk   of
    counterfeit medicine and problems in  accessing  emergency  care.   The
    roads in Pakistan were very dangerous.



Findings and Conclusions

14. I did not find Mr Pervez  to  be  a  credible  witness.   He  initially
    maintained that warfarin was not available in  Pakistan  when,  on  the
    unchallenged findings of the First-tier Judge, it is.  The  judge  also
    found that there was no satisfactory evidence  that  valve  replacement
    treatment or checkups would not be available to him there.

15. Neither do I accept that the Claimant would be  unable  to  afford  the
    treatment.  The clear evidence in his application  made  on  28th  July
    2011 was that he was being given �400 per month from his parents.  From
    that he paid �200 per month rent.  There is no evidence from them  that
    they are unable or unwilling to pay for  treatment  in  Pakistan.   The
    affidavit from his mother is entirely silent on the point.  His parents
    have paid �8,000 to finance his studies here  from  2010.   I  conclude
    they have the means to pay for his treatment in Pakistan and  there  is
    no indication whatsoever that they would not be willing to do so.

16. So far as the report from Dr Gaba is concerned it advises him to:

         "Go forth and get your treatment in the UK",

    and it is clear that he has been asked to prepare his report  in  order
    to support the application to remain in  the  UK.   He  makes  sweeping
    statements, e.g.:

         "In event of any bleeding native doctors have no knowledge that how
         to treat a patient of automated valve  so  in  case  of  any  wrong
         medication can induce destruction."

    It is hard to understand what is meant by this.  Furthermore he  refers
    to the Claimant's condition as being:

         "A little extra critical because you suffer  liver  and  depression
         problems as easily."

    No mention was made of any liver problems today.

17. The Claimant has been in the UK since 2010 and  came  for  a  temporary
    purpose.  He has established some private life here no  doubt,  but  in
    the knowledge and expectation that he would be returning to Pakistan.

18. Removal would be an interference with his private life but lawful since
    he has no basis of stay and in pursuant of a legitimate aim.

19. It would also be proportionate.  I have no doubt that the Claimant  has
    suffered ill health since his road traffic accident in the UK.   Whilst
    the causal link between the accident and the  valve  replacement  eight
    months later was not initially challenged by the Secretary of State,  I
    observe that there is no proper corroborative evidence in  the  medical
    reports that the accident caused the heart problem, but  in  any  event
    that is not material.   The  Claimant  is  prescribed  a  common  anti-
    coagulant to obviate  the  risk  of  future  heart  problems  which  is
    available in Pakistan.  This is far from being one of those rare  cases
    where an Article 8 appeal could succeed which has failed in relation to
    Article 3.

Decision

20. The original judge erred in law and his decision has been set aside  by
    Designated Judge Lewis.  It  is  remade  as  follows.   The  Claimant's
    appeal is dismissed.
