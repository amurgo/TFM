Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Balroop, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW

1.   The appellant has been granted permission to  appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Miles dismissing her  application  for  entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom as an adult child of  a  former  Gurkha
    soldier under Annex K of the Secretary of State's policy of  5  January
    2015.

2.   The respondent was not satisfied that  the  appellant  was  financially
    and emotionally dependent  on  the  sponsor;  that  the  appellant  was
    genuinely related to the sponsor in the United Kingdom as claimed; that
    there were sufficiently compelling circumstances in the application  to
    justify the grant of leave to the appellant outside the policy document
    on an  exceptional  basis.   The  respondent  was  satisfied  that  the
    appellant had lived apart from the sponsor for more than two  years  as
    at the date of application.  The date of application was  22  September
    2015.

3.   The appellant's father Mr Durga Bahadur Thapa gave oral  evidence.   In
    his witness statement which he adopted  as  his  evidence-in-chief,  he
    said that he joined the British Army in November 1974 and served  until
    November 1998, a period of fifteen years, based  in  various  countries
    including the United Kingdom.  He then returned  to  Nepal  and  stayed
    with his family for a year before obtaining employment in the Brunei as
    a security guard.  He returned to Nepal after  ten  years  but  had  no
    opportunity to settle in the United Kingdom because there was no policy
    at that time to enable him to do so.  However, had there been a  policy
    he would have  applied  together  with  all  his  family  and  children
    including the appellant who would have been under 18 years.

4.   When he was allowed to settle, he entered  the  UK  in  September  2010
    having been granted indefinite leave to enter.  He was  joined  by  his
    wife in March 2011 and another daughter  Sirimya  in  June  2011.   The
    appellant is his only daughter still living in Nepal.  She lives  alone
    and is solely financially dependent on him and dependent emotionally on
    his family.  He had paid for the education of all his children and  had
    used his pension and savings in that regard. She currently  resides  in
    rented accommodation which is also paid for by the sponsor.   His  wife
    spends a lot of time in Nepal  looking  after  the  appellant  and  the
    separation has affected all the members of the family.

5.   He said he has been visiting the appellant regularly since he  came  to
    the United Kingdom and he and his wife have made visits in 2012,  2013,
    2014, 2016 and January 2017.  He keeps in contact with the appellant by
    telephone three or four times per week  using  a  service  called  Lyca
    Mobile.  They also speak to each other using a free application on  the
    computer.  Recently they have  communicated  through  email  and  video
    chats.  He has supported his daughter  financially  by  sending  her  a
    monthly remittance of between �100 and �125.

6.   The sponsor stated that  when  the  appellant  was  born  he  had  been
    serving in Hong Kong.  He registered her  name  with  the  army  as  Om
    Kumari Thapa.  When the daughter was a bit older people started to call
    her Samjhana and she used that name when she was registered at school.

7.   The appellant relied on the documentation that  she  had  submitted  in
    support of her appeal.   They  included  a  number  of  money  transfer
    documents issued by Moneygram, Ria Financial Services Ltd  and  Western
    Union.  All related to transfers made in 2015, apart from one  in  2016
    and one in 2017.

8.   In  light  of  the  supporting  documentary  evidence,  the  judge  was
    satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the appellant was  named
    at birth Om Kumari Thapa by her father the sponsor but that she is  now
    known as Samjhana Thapa.

9.   The judge held that there was documentary  evidence  that  the  sponsor
    has provided financial support to the appellant since  his  arrival  in
    the United Kingdom.  However, that support only  covered  a  period  in
    2015 when, as was pointed out by the  respondent's  representative,  he
    entered the UK in 2011.  Furthermore, there was no documentary evidence
    to confirm the sponsor's statement that his army pension is paid into a
    Nepalese bank account with the Standard Chartered Bank and  that  those
    funds are used for the appellant's financial support.   The  judge  was
    not satisfied on the  evidence  that  the  appellant  was  sufficiently
    dependent on the sponsor.

10.  In terms of emotional dependence,  the  judge  accepted  the  sponsor's
    evidence on the matter and made a finding to that effect,  although  he
    observed that such a finding was simply that  of  emotional  dependence
    rather than "wholly dependent" given the wording of the policy.

11.  The judge held in terms of the period of  time  between  the  sponsor's
    entry to the United Kingdom and the making of  this  application,  that
    the period was clearly in excess of the two years identified  in  Annex
    K(9)(8) of the respondent's policy document of January 2015.   However,
    the judge said he was bound to observe that given  the  fact  that  the
    policy changed in favour of the sponsor being granted  entry  in  2009,
    and the policy for such a person such as the appellant only in  January
    2015, a gap of more than two years between the sponsor's settlement and
    the making of  an  application  by  a  person  in  this  situation  the
    appellant would, in his judgment, be  almost  inevitable.   Apart  from
    that requirement, and the challenge to the application on the emotional
    and financial dependency issue on which he has set  out  his  findings,
    there was no challenge by the  respondent  in  relation  to  the  other
    requirements of Annex K9 of the policy.  However,  the  judge  said  it
    must follow, on the basis of his findings that  he  was  not  satisfied
    that the appellant has met the requirements of the respondent's  policy
    document.  Therefore, the appeal cannot succeed on that basis.

12.  In the light of his findings, the judge said the only basis upon  which
    this  appeal  could  succeed  would  be  on   human   rights   grounds,
    specifically Article 8 ECHR when  considered  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules.  He had regard to the threshold set out by the Court  of  Appeal
    in SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387, namely "in our judgment, even though
    a test of exceptionality does not apply in every  case  falling  within
    the scope of Appendix FM, it  is  accurate  to  say  that  the  general
    position outside the sorts of special contexts  referred  to  above  is
    that compelling circumstances would need to be identified to support  a
    claim for grant of LTR outside the new Rules in Appendix  FM.   In  our
    view, there is a formulation which is  not  as  strict  as  a  test  of
    exceptionality or  a  requirement  of  "very  compelling  reasons"  (as
    referred to in MF (Nigeria) in the context of the Rules  applicable  to
    foreign criminals), but which gives appropriate  weight  to  the  focus
    consideration of public interest factors as  finds  expression  in  the
    Secretary of State's formulation of the new Rules in Appendix  FM.   It
    also reflects the formulation in Nagre at  paragraph  [29],  which  has
    been  tested  and  has  survived  scrutiny  in  this  court:  see  e.g.
    Haleemudeen at [44], per Beatson LJ (paragraph 33).

13.  The judge said that this guidance must apply in this case, even  though
    this is a case which fails under a policy rather than  the  Immigration
    Rules  themselves.   Given  his  adverse  finding  on   the   financial
    dependence issue in  this  case,  which  is  also  significant  in  any
    assessment of whether family life exists for the purposes of Article  8
    ECHR in this case given the age of the appellant,  the  judge  was  not
    satisfied that there are any sufficiently compelling  circumstances  to
    justify consideration of this appeal under Article 8 outside the Rules.
     Indeed, in his judgment it would be very difficult for  the  appellant
    to establish that family life for the purposes of the article has  been
    proved in this case because,  the  basis  of  his  findings,  the  only
    arguable basis would be on emotional dependency and in that regard  the
    judge said he was not satisfied that there is any evidence  to  suggest
    that the dependency in this case is anything other than normal ties  of
    love and affection in their relationship between  a  parent  and  adult
    child in any event.

14.  Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Holmes  who  said
    that no conclusion was reached by the judge upon whether the  appellant
    and the sponsor enjoyed family life together at any relevant date.  The
    judge appears to have  accepted  emotional  dependence  continued,  but
    arguably to have confused the test for financial dependency  with  that
    for family life between an adult child and their parents  and  sibling.
    There was no reference  to  any  of  the  relevant  jurisprudence,  and
    arguably the  decision  does  not  disclose  any  engagement  with  the
    principles set out therein Rai [2017] EWCA Civ 320 which  Judge  Holmes
    said was available at the date of the hearing.

15.  At the hearing before me Mr Balroop submitted  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    decision in Rai [2017] EWCA Civ 320 and the Upper  Tribunal's  decision
    in Pun and Others (Gurkhas - policy -  Article  8)  Nepal  [2011]  UKUT
    00377 (IAC).

16.  Mr Balroop submitted that the key issue in this case  is  family  life.
    This is because of the historical injustice  family  life  will  always
    outweigh the public interest unless there is criminal history  or  poor
    immigration.  Mr Rai submitted that there are no Immigration Rules  for
    an adult dependent child of a Gurkha.  Annex K is the  policy  that  is
    applied by the Secretary of  State  and  then  Article  8  outside  the
    Immigration Rules according to Gurung [2013] EWCA Civ 8.

17.  Mr Balroop identified the three key issues upon  which  the  respondent
    refused the appellant's application.  The  respondent  also  considered
    that Article 8(1) was not engaged because the appellant and her parents
    had been living apart for five years which meant that she was living an
    independent life.

18.  Mr Balroop said that at paragraph 19 the judge seemed to  suggest  that
    the requirement under the policy (K8) that the applicant has  not  been
    living apart from the former Gurkha for more than two years on the date
    of application seems non-sensical because in a case such as this  where
    the sponsor was granted entry in 2009 and the policy of a  person  such
    as the applicant only making an application in 2015 meant that the  gap
    of more than two years was inevitable.  In the circumstances Mr Balroop
    submitted that the appellant can only rely on Article 8.

19.  Mr Balroop relied on paragraph 17 of Rai where he  said  the  Court  of
    Appeal seemed to be watering  down  Kugathas  in  their  definition  of
    dependency.  The Court of Appeal held as follows:

    17.  In Kugathas v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2003]
         EWCA Civ 31, Sedley LJ said (in paragraph 17 of his judgment) that


             "If dependency is read  down  as  meaning  'support',  in  the
             personal sense,  and  if  one  adds,  echoing  the  Strasbourg
             jurisprudence, 'real' or 'committed'  or  'effective'  to  the
             word 'support', then it represents ... the irreducible minimum
             of what family life implies."


    Arden LJ said (in paragraph 24 of her judgment) that


         "Relevant  factors  ...  include  identifying  who  are  the   near
         relatives of the appellant, the nature of the  links  between  them
         and the appellant, the age of the appellant, where and with whom he
         has resided in the past, and the forms of contact he has maintained
         with the other members of the family with whom he claims to have  a
         family life."


    She acknowledged (at paragraph 25) that


             "There is no presumption of family life."


         Thus


             "A family life is not established between an adult  child  and
             his surviving parent or other siblings unless  something  more
             exists than normal emotional ties."


         She added that:


             "[Such] ties might exist if the appellant  were  dependent  on
             his family or vice versa, but it was 'not' ... essential  that
             the members of the family should be in the same country".


         In Patel and Others v Entry Clearance Officer, Mumbai  [2010]  EWCA
         Civ 17, Sedley LJ said (in paragraph 14 of his judgment, with which
         Longmore and Aikens L.JJ. agreed) that


             "What may constitute an extant family life falls well short of
             what constitutes dependency, and a good  many  adult  children
             ... may still have a family life  with  parents  who  are  now
             settled here not by leave or by force of circumstance  but  by
             long delayed right."

20.  Mr Balroop also relied on paragraph 39 where the Court of  Appeal  held
    as follows:

         "The Upper Tribunal Judge referred repeatedly  to  the  appellant's
         parents having chosen to settle in the United Kingdom, leaving  the
         appellant in the family home.  Each time he did so, he stressed the
         fact that this was a decision they had freely made ... but that, in
         my view, was not to confront the real issue  and  Article  8(1)  in
         this case, which was whether, as a matter of  fact,  the  appellant
         had demonstrated that he had a family life with his parents,  which
         had existed at the time of their departure to settle in the  United
         Kingdom and had endured beyond  it,  notwithstanding  their  having
         left Nepal when they did."

21.  Mr Balroop relied on the facts of this case.  He said that the  sponsor
    came to the UK in 2010 and the appellant's mother in 2011.   The  whole
    family were living together at the time the parents came to the  United
    Kingdom.  Both parents have visited the appellant regularly.  They came
    to the UK with one daughter and the appellant has remained in Nepal  on
    her own.  Mr Balroop submitted that  family  life  has  continued  even
    though the appellant lives in Nepal and her  parents  and  their  other
    daughter live in the United Kingdom.  Mr Balroop said  that  the  judge
    accepted that there was emotional dependency between  them  because  of
    the constant visits and contact between them.  He submitted  that  this
    was real and effective emotional dependency between the sponsor and the
    appellant.

22.  Mr Balroop submitted  that  his  only  concern  was  with  the  judge's
    finding financial dependence.  Mr Balroop relied on paragraph 24 of Pun
    where the Upper Tribunal held

         "We certainly accept that a contrived dependency will carry little,
         if any, weight within Article 8 either when deciding whether family
         life exists or when assessing proportionality,  that  if  financial
         dependency is  of  choice  to  the  extent  that  an  applicant  is
         dependent so that he or she can pursue further studies this  should
         not without more mean that such a  dependency  cannot  properly  be
         taken into account."

23.  Mr Balroop submitted that the appellant has been  studying  since  2011
    and has been relying  on  her  family  in  particular  her  father  for
    financial support.  That is the context within which the  judge  should
    have considered this issue.  Mr Balroop submitted that Article 8 has to
    be looked at in the round.  Emotional dependency was  accepted  by  the
    judge and there should have been  a  finding  by  the  judge  that  the
    appellant is financially supported by the sponsor.  There is  also  the
    fact that there was family life between the appellant and  her  parents
    before they came to the United Kingdom and has continued when they came
    to the United Kingdom without the appellant.

24.  Mr Tarlow submitted that Article 8 is the basis of this challenge.   At
    paragraphs 20 and 21 the judge made an assessment  of  the  appellant's
    case that was open  to  him.   The  judge  found  that  there  were  no
    compelling reasons to enter into the Article 8 arena.   The  dependency
    in this case is not more than the  normal  emotional  ties  between  an
    adult and a dependent child.





Findings

25.  It was accepted by both parties in the light of the  findings  made  by
    the judge in relation to the policy that the basis of  the  appellant's
    challenge could only be under Article 8 of the ECHR.

26.  I find that the judge only devoted paragraphs 20 and 21 to the  article
    8 claim.  I find that at paragraph  20  the  judge  did  not  make  any
    assessment of the  appellant's  case.   The  judge  merely  quoted  the
    threshold test set out by the Court of Appeal in SS (Congo).  The judge
    then applied it at paragraph 21 but found that in  the  light  of  this
    adverse finding on the financial dependence issue and in the  light  of
    the  appellant's  age  he  could  not  be  satisfied  that  there   are
    sufficiently compelling circumstances to justify consideration of  this
    appeal under Article 8 outside the Rules.  The judge then  went  on  to
    find that because of his findings it would be very  difficult  for  the
    appellant to establish that family for the purposes of the Article  has
    been proved in this case.  He held that family life could not exist  on
    the basis of emotional dependency only.

27.  I agree with the grant of permission that arguably the  judge  confused
    the test for financial dependency with that for "family life between an
    adult child and their parents".   I  note  that  the  judge  heard  the
    appellant's appeal on 25 April 2017.  The Court of Appeal's decision in
    Rai was issued on 28 April 2017, three days after the judge  heard  the
    appeal.  The appellant's decision was promulgated on 2  May  2017.   As
    the judge did not make any reference to Rai it is sufficient to  assume
    that he was not aware that the decision  had  become  public  knowledge
    four or five days prior to promulgation.

28.  Article 8 has to be looked at in the round.  I find that the  decisions
    in Pun and Rai could have made a material  difference  to  the  judge's
    decision.  Accordingly, the judge's decision cannot stand.

29.  I am of the view that the appellant's appeal under Article 8 has to  be
    reheard.

30.  The appeal is remitted to Hatton Cross to be reheard by a  judge  other
    than First-tier Tribunal Judge Miles.
