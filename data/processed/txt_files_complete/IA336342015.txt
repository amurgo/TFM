Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms S Ali, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a national of Brazil born on 29  July  1979.   He  has
    been granted permission to appeal against the decision made  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Asjad dismissing his appeal against the refusal  of
    the respondent on 13 October 2015 to  grant  him  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in the UK based upon ten years' lawful residence under paragraph
    276B of the Rules.

2.   Permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb as follows:

         "In finding that the appellant could not establish ten years lawful
         residence, the judge discounted time spent in the UK with leave  as
         a visitor and also whilst the  spouse  of  an  EEU  national.   The
         former is clearly an error.  The latter is  arguable,  particularly
         in the light of the respondent's own policy which,  in  any  event,
         does not appear to have been applied.  It raises an important point
         that the UT should consider.  Of course, even if the  EU  residence
         suffices the appellant will have to show that  his  separated  wife
         was, at the relevant times, exercising treaty rights in the UK."

    The respondent in her Rule 24 reply  did  not  oppose  the  appellant's
    application for permission  to  appeal  and  invited  the  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal with a fresh oral hearing to consider whether  the
    appellant has resided in accordance with the Regulations  to  aggregate
    the required ten years' residence.

3.   Mr Wilding accepted that the judge was wrong not to consider  that  the
    period of time the appellant was here as a visitor did  not  amount  to
    lawful leave.  He also accepted that the judge was wrong to  find  that
    time spent under the EEA  Regulations  did  not  count  towards  lawful
    residence.  Mr Wilding submitted that the judge  was  confused  because
    the Immigration Rules themselves do not allow for time spent in the  UK
    as an EEA spouse.  However, Home Office guidance on  long  residence  -
    V13.0 published for Home Office staff on 8 May 2015, has  remained  the
    same despite the current guidance being updated, and does say that time
    spent by individuals  in  the  UK  under  the  provisions  of  the  EEA
    Regulations is  not  subject  to  immigration  control,  and  that  the
    individual would not be required to have  leave  to  enter  or  remain.
    However, a case worker must apply discretion and count  time  spent  in
    the UK as lawful residence for an EU or EEA national  or  their  family
    members exercising their treaty rights to reside in the UK.  Sufficient
    evidence must be provided to demonstrate that the  applicant  has  been
    exercising treaty rights throughout any period that they are seeking to
    rely on for the purposes of meeting the long residence rules.

4.   Mr Wilding submitted that the judge did not take  the  point  that  the
    refusal by the respondent was because the appellant  had  not  provided
    evidence that his spouse was exercising treaty rights in the UK at  the
    relevant times.

5.   In the light of the documentary evidence  submitted  by  the  appellant
    with his appeal, the only relevant period that Mr Wilding raised as  an
    issue was the appellant's spouse's earnings in the  tax  year  2011/12.
    He submitted that in the tax year 2010 - 11, his spouse earned  �5,726,
    under �500 a month.  It was even less in the  tax  year  2011/12.   Her
    income earned in that tax year was �2,981.  He questioned whether  this
    was genuine employment or incidental employment.

6.   Ms Ali emphasised the point  that  the  appellant  was  issued  with  a
    residence card as a family member of an EEA  national  on  14  February
    2011.  The sponsor's income for the tax year 2011/12 was  �2,981.   The
    respondent issued the residence card on the basis that the  appellant's
    wife was exercising treaty rights at that time.  During the  two  years
    that is the tax year 2010/11 and the tax year  2011/12,  the  appellant
    was working full-time as a security guard.  He  was  earning  the  main
    income at that time.  The appellant submitted a P60 for  the  tax  year
    ending  5  April  2012.   It  indicated  that  the   appellant   earned
    �18,786.64.  He submitted pay slips covering that tax year.

7.   On the issue as to whether the sponsor's  income  which  was  far  less
    than the appellant's income was incidental  income,  Ms  Ali  following
    instructions from the appellant said that at the time the  couple  were
    trying for a baby and the appellant's spouse had  miscarried.   Ms  Ali
    accepted that there  was  no  documentary  evidence  to  support  these
    assertions.

8.   Ms Ali relied on documentary evidence from HM Revenue and  Customs  for
    the appellant's spouse for the  tax  years  2013/14  showing  that  she
    earned �12,438; and for the tax year 2014/15 showing  that  she  earned
    �13,261.

9.   Ms Ali submitted that the appellant has  provided  sufficient  evidence
    to show that his wife was exercising  treaty  rights  at  all  material
    times.  In the bundle was a letter from the owner of Andre and Adam,  a
    hair  dressing  salon,  dated  August  2015  stating  that  Mrs   Uanda
    Christiana De Souza Oliveira was self-employed as a hairdresser.

10.  Ms Ali submitted that the judge did not highlight any of this  evidence
    and had he done so he would have come to a different conclusion.

11.  In reply Mr Wilding submitted that it  was  not  relevant  to  consider
    whether the appellant was working at the time or not.  The question  to
    be asked is whether his spouse was economically  active.   He  accepted
    that Ms Ali had made a good point about the issuing  of  the  residence
    card.  There was corroborating evidence from the appellant to show that
    in the tax year 2010/11 his wife was exercising treaty rights and  that
    evidence led the Secretary of State  to  issue  him  with  a  residence
    stamp.  However, he submitted that the residence stamp does not support
    the argument that his wife was economically active in 2011/12 when  she
    earned �2,981; that equated to �250 a month which he said  amounted  to
    income for incidental work.  It may well be that the appellant was  the
    main breadwinner and that the sponsor took a significant step away from
    working.

12.   Mr  Wilding  did  not  take  issue  with  the  income  earned  by  the
    appellant's spouse from April 2012/2013 tax year onwards.  He  accepted
    that there was a significant increase in his wife's income.

FINDINGS

13.  The only issue in this case  is  whether  this  spouse  was  exercising
    treaty rights in the UK at the relevant times.  It was evident  in  the
    submissions made by Mr. Wilding that the only period he  was  disputing
    was the tax year April 2011/12 when she earned �2981.

14.  I find in favour of the appellant in the light of the  evidence  before
    me.

15.  The ten-year period that we are looking at is from 15 October  2004  to
    15 October 2014.  The appellant entered the UK with entry clearance  as
    a visitor valid until 15 April 2005.  He  was  then  granted  leave  to
    remain as a student on 11 April 2005 until 31  December  2006.   On  29
    November 2007 he made an application for leave to remain as a dependent
    spouse.   Although  this  was  rejected  on  17  December   2007,   his
    application was granted on 19 December 2007 until  30  September  2008.
    On 27 September 2008, he was granted  further  leave  to  remain  as  a
    dependent spouse until  30  October  2010.   On  31  October  2010  his
    application for a residence permit under the EEA Regulations was issued
    which was valid from 14 February 2011 until 14 February 2016.  This was
    on the basis of his marriage to an Italian national, Uanda Christina De
    Souza Oliveira. I accept Ms Ali's submission that the  respondent  must
    have  been  satisfied  that  the  appellant's  spouse  was  in  the  UK
    exercising treaty rights.

16.  The respondent has now accepted that the appellant's  leave  to  remain
    as a visitor  counted  towards  his  ten-year  lawful  residence.   The
    respondent has also accepted in the light of the Home  Office  guidance
    on long residence that the time  spent  by  the  appellant  whilst  the
    spouse of an EU national also counted towards the ten-year period.

17.  Mr Wilding argued that the  spouse's  income  for  2011/12  was  �2,981
    amounting to approximately �250 per month.  This did not indicate  that
    she was economically active and  that  her  employment  was  incidental
    employment.  I do not accept this argument. I find that she was to some
    extent economically active even though her income for that tax year was
    not substantial. There was  evidence  that  she  was  a  self  employed
    hairdresser.   It  may  well  be  that  the  appellant  was  the   main
    breadwinner and that the sponsor took a significant step  from  working
    full time. Whatever the reason may be, I find  that  she  did  earn  an
    income, albeit  significantly  less  than  her  previous  earnings  and
    subsequent earnings.

18.  On the evidence before me  I  find  that  the  appellant's  spouse  was
    exercising treaty rights at all material times.

19.  Accordingly, I find that the appellant's appeal succeeds.



Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed.
