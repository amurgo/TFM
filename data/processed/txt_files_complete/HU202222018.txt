Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Anonymity was granted at an earlier stage of  the  proceedings  because  the
case involves child welfare  issues.  I  find  that  it  is  appropriate  to
continue the order. Unless and until a tribunal or court directs  otherwise,
the appellant is granted anonymity. No report  of  these  proceedings  shall
directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.  This
direction applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.


Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr M. West, instructed by J F Batula
For the respondent:    Mr P. Singh, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant appealed the respondent's  decision  dated  20  December
    2018 to refuse a human rights  claim  in  the  context  of  deportation
    proceedings.

2.    First-tier Tribunal Judge Bird ("the judge") dismissed the  appeal  in
    a decision promulgated  on  14  November  2019.  The  judge  noted  the
    appellant's immigration history [2-3].  She  outlined  the  appellant's
    conviction for fraud and the fact that he was sentenced to  five  years
    and  three  months'  imprisonment  [4].  The  conviction  led  to   the
    respondent's decision to make a deportation order on 10 September  2018
    [5-6]. The judge summarised the respondent's reasons for  refusing  the
    appellant's subsequent human rights claim [7-20].  She  summarised  the
    main points raised in the appellant's grounds of appeal [19].

3.    The judge went on to outline the evidence given by the  appellant  and
    his partner at the hearing [21-34]. The appellant told the judge  about
    the history of his relationship with his partner [21]. He outlined  his
    education and qualifications [22]. He  explained  what  action  he  had
    taken to rehabilitate during his time in prison and told the judge that
    he had achieved the status of a trusted 'red band' prisoner [23-24]. He
    took responsibility for his role in the crime and expressed regret  for
    his actions [25]. The judge also noted the appellant's evidence that he
    suffered a heart  attack  in  2017.  He  received  treatment  and  took
    medication [27]. The appellant last visited  his  (foster)  parents  in
    Nigeria in 2010 [30].

4.    The judge summarised the evidence given by the appellant's partner  at
    the hearing [31-34]. She confirmed that she had two children  with  the
    appellant and one child from a previous relationship. The oldest  child
    did not know that the appellant was not his father.  He  was  the  only
    father he had ever known. She was asked  about  what  difficulties  she
    might face if they lived in Nigeria. She confirmed that she had visited
    Nigeria for a month in 2009. There was discrimination. The children did
    not have any medical issues, but she had type 2 diabetes.

5.    The judge directed herself to the relevant  legal  framework  [42-49].
    She correctly identified that this was a case where a foreign  criminal
    was sentenced to a period of  imprisonment  of  over  four  years.  The
    appellant could only succeed if he could show  that  there  were  'very
    compelling  circumstances'  to  outweigh   the   public   interest   in
    deportation with reference  to  section  117C(6)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("NIAA 2002").  The judge  referred  to
    the Supreme Court decisions in Hesham Ali v SSHD [2017] Imm AR 484  and
    KO (Nigeria) v SSHD [2018] 1 WLR 5273 [50][54] thereby demonstrating an
    understanding of the significant weight  that  must  be  given  to  the
    public interest in  cases  involving  sentences  of  over  four  years'
    imprisonment. The evidence  indicated  that  the  appellant's  criminal
    activity took place over a number of years from 2009  until  2013.  The
    sentencing judge found that the appellant played a  "leading  role"  in
    the conspiracy. The  judge  noted  that  the  appellant  continued  his
    relationship at a time when he knew he was  committing  an  offence  as
    part of a criminal conspiracy, which  may  have  defrauded  the  public
    purse of as much as �13 million [55-58].

6.    Having considered the weight to be given to the  public  interest  the
    judge turned to evaluate the appellant's  personal  circumstances.  She
    observed that the appellant's partner entered the relationship  in  the
    knowledge that he did not have settled status in the UK.  The  children
    were born at a time when his status was precarious [59-60].

7.    The appellant  could  only  argue  the  case  with  reference  to  the
    exception contained in section 117C(6) NIAA 2002.  However,  the  judge
    took the structured approach suggested by the Court  of  Appeal  in  NA
    (Pakistan) v SSHD [2017] 1 WLR 207  by  considering,  as  part  of  the
    overall assessment, the extent to which any of the other exceptions  to
    deportation might apply. The judge reminded herself that  the  test  of
    whether deportation would be 'unduly harsh' on the appellant's children
    was a stringent one that went beyond  the  usual  negative  effects  of
    deportation on children [61-62]. She was aware that the  appellant  was
    orphaned at a young age because she considered that the appellant could
    return to live with his foster parents (his uncle) in Nigeria [63]. She
    considered the fact that the appellant's  partner  earned  around  �20-
    25,000 a year and had visited Nigeria for a month in 2009 [64].

8.    The judge found that there was insufficient evidence to show  that  it
    would be unduly harsh on his partner or children to  accompany  him  to
    Nigeria. The appellant was an educated  man  who  had  the  benefit  of
    family support in Nigeria. He would be able to  work  and  support  his
    family  [68].  She  acknowledged  his  partner's  concerns  about   the
    possibility of discrimination but found that there was nothing  in  the
    evidence to show that this  would  elevate  the  circumstances  to  the
    required level of undue  harshness  [66].  There  was  no  evidence  to
    suggest that the child from his partner's earlier relationship had  any
    contact with his biological father [69].

9.    In the alternative, the judge went on to consider whether it would  be
    unduly harsh for the appellant's partner and children to remain in  the
    UK without him. The judge noted that the appellant had been  in  prison
    since 2017. There was no evidence  to  show  that  his  absence  had  a
    negative impact on the children's wellbeing. Their mother continued  to
    care for the children and provided them with emotional support  in  his
    absence. The judge concluded that there was no evidence  to  show  that
    the children would suffer anything beyond the negative effects  usually
    associated with the absence of a parent following deportation [67]. The
    judge concluded that the evidence which she had "seen  and  heard"  did
    not show that there  were  very  compelling  circumstances  that  would
    outweigh the public interest in deportation given  that  the  appellant
    was sentenced to a period of over four years' imprisonment [71-73].

10.   A preliminary issue  was  raised  at  the  beginning  of  the  hearing
    regarding the relevant grounds of appeal. The  Upper  Tribunal  records
    indicated that the appellant's legal representative  submitted  grounds
    drafted by counsel on 28 November 2019 as  well  as  a  second  set  of
    undated grounds drafted by J F  Batula.  The  grounds  drafted  by  the
    solicitors were poorly pleaded, made general submissions, and failed to
    identify any arguable errors of law that would have justified  granting
    permission. Neither Mr West nor Mr Singh had a copy of the  second  set
    of grounds. It was apparent from the wording  of  the  order  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal judge who granted permission did so  based  on  the
    grounds drafted by counsel. It was agreed that the relevant grounds for
    the purpose of this appeal were the ones drafted by counsel.

11.   The appellant appealed the First-tier Tribunal decision on the  ground
    that the judge  failed  to  consider  relevant  evidence  submitted  in
    support of the appeal. She failed to  give  adequate  reasons  for  her
    decision. It is submitted that she failed  to  consider  the  following
    factors, which cumulatively, could  outweigh  the  public  interest  in
    deportation:

      i) The appellant had a difficult upbringing having been orphaned at  a
         young age;

     ii) The appellant's partner is of Indian descent, their children are of
         mixed heritage and would face difficulties in Nigeria as a result;

    iii) The background evidence relating to  the  treatment  of  women  and
         girls in Nigeria;

     iv) The significant role that the appellant plays in the  life  on  his
         step-son, who has only ever known the appellant as his father;

      v) The respondent's delay in considering the  appellant's  application
         for leave to remain as a Tier 1 Migrant, which was only  voided  on
         30 July 2017 (6 years later);

    (vi)   The fact that the appellant was convicted of  a  single  offence
         and there was significant evidence  of  rehabilitation.  The  OASys
         report assessed him to be at low risk of serious harm; and

    (vii)  The appellant's good prison record, including a letter from  the
         Governor of HMP The Mount dated 26 July 2019 and  the  letter  from
         the Shannon Trust dated 22 July 2019.

Decision and reasons

12.   It is apparent from the  summary  of  the  judge's  findings  outlined
    above that she directed herself to the correct legal framework and  was
    aware of the significant weight  that  must  be  given  to  the  public
    interest in deportation in cases involving sentences of imprisonment of
    over four years. The judge took a structured approach to the assessment
    of whether there were 'very compelling circumstances' to  outweigh  the
    public interest in deportation by considering the extent to  which  any
    of the other exceptions to deportation might apply within  the  context
    of the overall balancing exercise conducted under section 117C(6)  NIAA
    2002.

13.   The sole legal point raised in the grounds is that  the  judge  failed
    to make findings regarding relevant considerations. I accept that there
    is some force to this argument in relation to certain  aspects  of  the
    decision. It is incumbent on a judge to give adequate reasons  for  her
    decision so that the parties can understand how and  why  the  Tribunal
    concluded as it did. It is not necessary for a judge to deal with every
    piece of evidence, but where evidence is relevant to the assessment, it
    should be assessed, and adequate reasons should  be  given  to  explain
    what weight is placed on it. It is a basic rule of decision writing  to
    ensure that the case of the  losing  party,  in  particular,  has  been
    adequately addressed.

14.   In assessing whether  there  were  very  compelling  circumstances  to
    outweigh the public interest in deportation, the judge was  correct  to
    begin by analysing the nature of  the  offence  and  to  consider  what
    weight should be given to the public interest. It was open  to  her  to
    place significant weight on the public  interest  considerations  given
    the length of the sentence and the sentencing remarks, which  suggested
    that the appellant played a leading role in a  large-scale  fraud.  She
    then turned to consider the individual circumstances of  the  appellant
    and his family in  order  to  assess  whether  they  were  sufficiently
    compelling to outweigh the public interest considerations.

15.   The appellant fell far short of the private life  exception  contained
    in section 117C(4) NIAA 2002. He had not lived in the UK  lawfully  for
    most of his life. It was apparent that he continued  to  have  familial
    and cultural connections to Nigeria and would not face very significant
    obstacles to integration there.

16.   The judge accepted that  the  appellant  had  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationships  with  his  British  partner  and  their  children.   She
    addressed the two elements of the  'unduly  harsh'  test  contained  in
    section 117C(5) NIAA 2002.  I  accept  that  the  judge's  analysis  of
    whether it would be  unduly  harsh  for  the  appellant's  partner  and
    children to live with him in Nigeria was  inadequate.  The  most  basic
    element of such an assessment is to begin by making  findings  relating
    to the best interests of the children: see ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD  [2011]
    1  FLR  2170.  No  assessment  was  carried  out  in  this   case.   No
    consideration was given to whether it was in the best interests of  the
    children to be removed from the advantages of life in the  UK  to  less
    advantaged conditions in Nigeria. No holistic consideration  was  given
    to whether a combination of factors, including (i)  the  weight  to  be
    given to British nationality; (ii) the fact that the  children  are  of
    mixed heritage and may face discrimination; (iii) the use  of  corporal
    punishment in schools in Nigeria; and (iv) discrimination against women
    and girls generally, was a sufficiently compelling set of circumstances
    that might meet the stringent test.

17.   Although I accept that findings as  to  whether  it  would  be  unduly
    harsh for the appellant's partner and children  to  live  with  him  in
    Nigeria was inadequately reasoned, it  only  formed  one  part  of  the
    overall assessment under section 117C(5) NIAA 2002. The second  element
    was to consider whether it would be unduly harsh  for  the  appellant's
    partner and children to remain in the UK without him if he is deported.
    In  such  circumstances  the  judge's  failure  to  conduct  a   proper
    assessment of the best  interests  of  the  children  had  less  impact
    because it is widely recognised that  it  would  not  be  in  the  best
    interests of children to be separated  from  a  loving  and  supportive
    parent. It is usually in the best interests of children to  be  brought
    up by both parents.

18.   However, the Court of Appeal in NA  (Pakistan)  made  clear  that  the
    fact that it is not in the best interests of children to  be  separated
    from a parent is  not  usually  a  sufficiently  compelling  factor  to
    outweigh the public interest in deportation.

         "33.     Although there  is  no  'exceptionality'  requirement,  it
             inexorably follows from the statutory scheme that the cases in
             which circumstances are sufficiently  compelling  to  outweigh
             the high public interest in  deportation  will  be  rare.  The
             commonplace incidents of family life, such as  ageing  parents
             in poor  health  or  the  natural  love  between  parents  and
             children, will not be sufficient.

         34.      The best  interests  of  children  certainly  carry  great
             weight, as identified by Lord Kerr in HH v  Deputy  Prosecutor
             of the Italian Republic [2012] UKSC 25; [2013]  1  AC  338  at
             [145]. Nevertheless, it is a consequence of  criminal  conduct
             that offenders may be separated from their children  for  many
             years, contrary to the best interests of those  children.  The
             desirability  of  children  being  with  both  parents  is   a
             commonplace of family life. That is not usually a sufficiently
             compelling circumstance to outweigh the high  public  interest
             in deporting foreign criminals."

19.   The evidence before the  judge  showed  that  the  appellant  and  his
    partner have three children. Their evidence indicated that  the  oldest
    child (A) was unaware of the  fact  that  the  appellant  was  not  his
    biological father. A letter from A  outlined  the  activities  that  he
    enjoyed doing with his dad. He said that his father had "been gone  for
    quite a long time now" and that he would be the "happiest boy on earth"
    when he comes home. He said that his sister also misses  him  and  they
    pray for him to come  back.  The  letter  showed  the  usual  level  of
    attachment one might expect between a father and child and the  child's
    understandable desire for his dad to come home.

20.   The appellant's partner said that it was more difficult  to  care  for
    the children in his absence and asserted that it was not in their  best
    interests to be separated from their father. Of course,  the  appellant
    is responsible for the current separation  and  the  threat  of  future
    separation. The threat of deportation arises from his actions.  I  note
    that the appellant's cousin made a statement saying that her mother had
    to come from Nigeria on "a number of occasions" to help the appellant's
    partner because she was struggling to look after the children  and  was
    taking anti-depressants. However, his partner mentioned none of this in
    her statement and it seems that there was no evidence to support  these
    assertions. Other than that, there was no evidence to show that any  of
    the children suffered from serious health problems or  which  disclosed
    any other compelling or compassionate circumstances.

21.   The appellant included evidence to  show  that  he  suffered  a  heart
    attack in 2017. He asserted that he continued to receive  treatment  in
    the UK but there was no evidence to suggest that he could  not  receive
    similar treatment in Nigeria. His partner said that she  suffered  from
    type 2 diabetes, but again, there was no evidence of current  treatment
    or to show that she would not be able to receive adequate treatment  in
    Nigeria. Those health issues were not identified as factors that needed
    to be considered in more detail in the grounds of appeal.

22.   The judge outlined  the  evidence  given  by  the  appellant  and  his
    partner at the hearing. She clearly had regard to her evidence that  it
    had been more difficult to look after the  children  while  he  was  in
    prison [32-33]. It was open to the  judge  to  take  into  account  the
    evidence showing that the appellant's partner was still able to work to
    support the children  [64].  Nothing  in  the  evidence  disclosed  any
    compelling or compassionate circumstances that went over and above  the
    usual difficulties one  might  expect  in  such  circumstances.  Having
    considered the evidence that was  before  the  judge  relating  to  the
    impact that separation  would  have  on  the  appellant's  partner  and
    children, I find that it was open to the judge to conclude, without the
    need for further explanation, that there was no evidence to  show  that
    the effect of deportation would be  unduly  harsh  if  the  appellant's
    partner and children remained in  the  UK  without  him  [67].  If  her
    finding in relation to the  second  element  of  the  assessment  under
    section 117C(5) is adequately reasoned, her failure  to  give  adequate
    reasons in relation to the first element does  not  make  any  material
    difference to the outcome.

23.   Turning to consider the points listed in the grounds. It is  difficult
    to see  how  point  (i)  could  have  been  given  any  weight  in  the
    assessment. It seems obvious that the loss of the  appellant's  parents
    at such a young age was likely to have an impact  on  him,  but  it  is
    difficult to see how it amounts to  a  compassionate  factor  that  was
    relevant to the balancing exercise. The appellant  was  brought  up  by
    other family members, was able to obtain an education,  and  to  obtain
    work to support his family. There was no evidence before the  judge  to
    suggest that he suffered any particular vulnerability as  a  result  of
    his early loss or that it was a factor  that  would  prevent  him  from
    being able to re-establish himself  in  Nigeria.  At  best,  it  was  a
    neutral factor.

24.   In relation to points (ii) and (iii) I accept that  the  judge  failed
    to make adequate findings relating to the conditions the  family  might
    face if they lived in Nigeria. However, those points only went  to  the
    first element of  the  exception  contained  in  section  117C(5).  The
    judge's findings relating  to  the  second  element  were  sustainable.
    Clearly it would not be in the best interests of  the  children  to  be
    separated from their father but the evidence before the judge did  not,
    as  a  matter  of  fact,  disclose  any  compelling  or   compassionate
    circumstances  that  went  beyond  the  usual   negative   effects   of
    deportation on children. In so far as it formed  part  of  the  overall
    assessment under section 117C(6) it was open to the judge to find  that
    deportation would not be unduly harsh on  the  appellant's  partner  or
    children.

25.   In relation to point (iv), Mr West struggled to find any  real  reason
    why the appellant's relationship with A was any  more  compelling  that
    his relationship with his biological children. I accept that there  may
    be circumstances where a child's history includes  previous  separation
    from a parent. The prospect of separation from another person with whom
    they have bonded might begin to raise a case above the  usual  negative
    effects of deportation. Whether the circumstances of a child rise above
    the relevant threshold is fact sensitive. In this  case,  the  evidence
    given by his partner was that  A  is  unaware  of  the  fact  that  the
    appellant is not his biological father. He  has  no  contact  with  his
    biological father. In the circumstances, it is  difficult  to  see  how
    deportation would affect him any differently to the other children.  On
    the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal, the fact that A is not the
    appellant's  biological  child  was  unlikely  to  make  any   material
    difference to the balancing exercise.

26.   Point  (v)  is  particularly  weak.  The  principles  outlined  in  EB
    (Kosovo) v SSHD [2008] UKHL 41 only go to the extent to which delay  in
    decision making may have strengthened the appellant's ties to  the  UK.
    The  appellant  fell  far  short  of  the  private  life  exception  to
    deportation and relied largely on his relationship with his partner and
    children, which were considered under a different  exception.  Even  if
    the application  had  been  considered  promptly  and  he  was  granted
    Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) the effect of the deportation decision
    would have been to revoke such leave. In any event, it is reasonable to
    infer that there may have been a good reason for the delay  given  that
    the appellant  says  that  he  was  arrested  in  2012  and  was  under
    investigation for some time before being charged.  It  is  unsurprising
    that it might have taken time to investigate such a large-scale fraud.

27.   The last two  points  relate  to  the  appellant's  criminal  history,
    rehabilitation and the risk of reoffending. These  matters  might  have
    some relevance to the overall assessment but were unlikely to be  given
    any meaningful weight on the facts of this case.

28.   The fact that the appellant was  convicted  of  a  single  offence  is
    immaterial when it was a sufficiently  serious  offence  to  attract  a
    sentence of five  years  and  three  months'  imprisonment.  It  was  a
    particularly long sentence for an offence of this kind. The  sentencing
    remarks made clear that the appellant played  a  leading  role  in  the
    conspiracy and that the fraud was of sufficient scale to impact on  the
    public interest. The sentencing judge said that the monies lost to  the
    fraud could and should have been used to benefit the public.  At  least
    �2,500,000 was lost from the public purse. The scale of the fraud could
    have been up to �13,367,000. If the appellant was  convicted  of  theft
    and sentenced to a short period of imprisonment, then the fact that  he
    only had a single conviction is a factor that might reduce  the  public
    interest in deportation to some extent. However,  it  is  not  arguable
    that it would have made any material difference to  the  assessment  in
    this case when the appellant was convicted of such a  serious  offence,
    which by its nature and  scale  added  further  weight  to  the  public
    interest considerations.

29.   There was evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  to  show  that  the
    appellant had a good prison  record  and  had  worked  hard  to  access
    opportunities for rehabilitation. This is a credit to the appellant but
    is a matter that would be given little or no weight in  the  assessment
    given that all prisoners are expected to behave  well  in  custody  and
    should work towards rehabilitation. At best it  was  a  neutral  factor
    that did not reduce the weight to be given to the  public  interest  in
    deportation.

30.   Similarly, the OASys report indicated that the appellant posed  a  low
    risk of serious harm but this is a neutral factor in the absence of any
    other compelling or compassionate circumstances  that  might  begin  to
    show that there were very compelling circumstances that could  outweigh
    the public interest in deportation. If an assessment showed a  risk  of
    reoffending it would lend further weight  to  the  public  interest  in
    deportation. The fact that the appellant is unlikely to reoffend  is  a
    neutral factor given that everyone is expected to abide by the law.  It
    does not add any weight to the appellant's side of the scale.

31.   I accept that the judge did not engage with the factors identified  in
    the grounds in detail, but the level of reasoning required will  depend
    on the circumstances of each case. She  noted  and  was  aware  of  the
    relevant facts on the appellant's side of the scales even if she failed
    to make specific findings when she came to weigh up the  circumstances.
    For the reasons given above, it is difficult to  see  how  any  of  the
    factors identified by  the  appellant,  either  individually  or  taken
    together, could have  come  close  to  showing  that  there  were  very
    compelling circumstances to outweigh the significant weight  that  must
    be placed on the public  interest  in  deportation  given  the  serious
    nature of the offence. If it was at least arguable  that  the  evidence
    was capable of outweighing the public interest  my  decision  might  be
    different, but the evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal  fell  far
    short of showing that there were very compelling circumstances  of  the
    kind that might outweigh the public  interest  considerations  in  this
    case.

32.   The evidence showed that the appellant had a typical family life  with
    his partner and children. Undoubtedly, his deportation would not be  in
    the best interests of the children and would  cause  real  difficulties
    for his partner who would be left to raise them without his  day-to-day
    support. It would be open to them to continue their  life  together  in
    Nigeria, but if they chose not to do so,  the  judge  gave  sustainable
    reasons to explain why it would not be unduly harsh for them to  remain
    in the UK without him. Nothing in  the  evidence  disclosed  any  other
    particularly compelling or compassionate circumstances that went beyond
    the usual negative effects of deportation. Although I acknowledge  that
    there was some lack of reasoning, any error  arising  from  a  lack  of
    detail in the judge's findings would have made no  material  difference
    to the outcome of the appeal. Any properly directed First-tier Tribunal
    judge would be bound to come to the same conclusion on the evidence.

33.   I conclude that the First-tier Tribunal decision did not  involve  the
    making of an error of law that would have made any material  difference
    to the outcome of the appeal.
