Representation:

For the Appellant:  Mr Osaro Richards, 'Law Clinic', Corby NN17 1BF
For the Respondent: Mr Richard Hopkin, Home Office Presenting Officer

Fairness  requires  the  Secretary  of  State  to  give  an   applicant   an
opportunity to address grounds for refusal, of which he  did  not  know  and
could not have known, failing which the resulting decision may be set  aside
on appeal as contrary to law (without contravening the provisions of s.  85A
of the Nationality, Asylum and Immigration Act 2002).

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.     This is an appeal, by the appellant,  against  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge BH Forster OBE), sitting at  Newport  on  18
    July, to dismiss a Tier 4 (general) student migrant appeal by a citizen
    of Pakistan, against refusal of leave to remain on  31  May.  There  is
    only one issue before us, which is whether the appellant  was  entitled
    to be treated as having an 'established presence' as a student in  this
    country, on the basis of the course he had already taken. It is  common
    ground that, if he was entitled to that treatment, then he  could  show
    the necessary funding under the points-based system; but if  not,  then
    not: there is no issue on the other requirements.

 2. The appellant arrived in this country on a student visa on  31  January
    2010 (the '2011' in the PF1 seems  to  be  the  result  of  the  writer
    misreading the date obscured by the ornamental border of  the  passport
    page attached at (2)). His visa had been issued on  18  December  2009,
    and was valid till 31 May 2011.  The  appellant  then  enrolled  on  an
    Association of  Computer  Professionals  [ACP]  course  at  the  London
    College of Research (LCR, based in Reading, despite its name), and duly
    completed it in March 2011, getting his ACP certificate  on  the  29th.
    Again it is common ground that, if he had  produced  evidence  of  this
    with his application for further leave to remain, then  he  would  have
    been entitled to be treated as having an 'established presence' here.

 3. The application form runs to 39 pages, and a great many questions  that
    he answered accurately. The appellant was now  applying  for  leave  to
    remain on another course, at  a  college  called  'Eurospeak',  and  at
    section K ('Attributes') of  the  form  he  gave  the  Confirmation  of
    Acceptance for Studies [CAS] number and other details for that. Next he
    completed section L ('Maintenance (funds)').  Again  the  questions  in
    that referred to his funding for the  new  course:  the  only  question
    which referred to his previous one was L4.

 4. At L4 the appellant ticked the box entitled 'Application for a  further
    period of study and qualifies for the reduced maintenance level'.  This
    led to question L10: "The student must  have  �600  for  each  calendar
    month of their course up to a maximum of 2 months.  Please  state  what
    this amount is". He duly did so - �1,200 - and  produced  the  bank  or
    building society statements required at question L24 to vouch  for  his
    having that money. What nothing anywhere in the form required him to do
    was to produce documentary evidence that he had completed his  previous
    course.

 5. The appellant made his application on 18 April, and on 19 May the  Home
    Office  caseworker,  without  further  reference  to  him,  set   about
    verifying his claim to an 'established  presence'.  This  was  done  by
    sending an e-mail to LCR, answered the same day by Zahid Raza, who  did
    not give his position with the college, but said:

       "In response to your e-mail I can confirm that Mr  Naveed  Ahmed  was
       enrolled on ACP computing course with us but he did not complete  his
       course and moved to another college."

    The  subject  line  referred,  following  the  Home  Office  query,  to
    "Muhammad Naveed". There is no issue but that the inquiry was taken  to
    relate to this appellant; or that the answer  was  in  fact  incorrect,
    because the appellant had finished his course and got his certificate.

 6. The next thing that happened, again without further  reference  to  the
    appellant, was that the Home Office refused his application on 31  May,
    in a standard form which dealt with the result of  their  inquiries  as
    follows:

       "As ...  your  previous  college  have  stated  that  you  have  not
       completed your course of study you are not eligible for claiming the
       reduced maintenance rate ..."



 7. On 13 June the appellant appealed, completing  the  form  himself,  and
    fully setting out his  case  at  section  8.  He  also  enclosed  three
    documents, entitled

     a) 'Certificate in Information Technology & Programming' from the ACP,
        dated 29 March, showing he had passed four subjects in that course,
        one  with  a  credit,  and  was  entitled  to  the  award  of   the
        Certificate, which was to follow;

     b) 'Certification of Student Status' from the  LCR,  dated  14  April,
        showing his course as starting on 8 February 2010, and finishing in
        March 2011, with an 88% attendance rate by  the  appellant:  it  is
        signed "K. Shehzad, Principal";

     c) 'Confirmation of Student Progress', from the  LCR,  dated  9  June,
        showing that he was (clearly meaning had been in the past) enrolled
        on a full-time ACP course with them, on which he  had  successfully
        completed the first of three year-long stages, for the Certificate.

 8. It is common ground that, if the appellant had sent in these documents,
    or the two which were available, with his application on 18 April, then
    he would have been entitled to be treated  as  having  an  'established
    presence' in this country, and so to succeed on his appeal. It is  also
    clear that, had the law remained what it was when the appellant applied
    for his extension of stay, then he could have produced the  certificate
    to the  First-tier  judge  without  difficulty  and  succeeded  in  his
    appeal..

 9. The general rule for an in-country appeal is at s. 85 (4):

        "On an appeal under section 82(1) against a decision  the  Tribunal
        may consider evidence about any matter which it thinks relevant  to
        the substance of the decision, including evidence which concerns  a
        matter arising after the date of the decision."

10. However, Mr Hopkin argued that the effect of s. 85A of  the  2002  Act,
    which came into force on 23 May 2011, was to prevent either  the  judge
    or us from taking any of those  documents  into  account.  We  are  not
    concerned with  exception  1,  introduced  by  s.  85A  (3);  but  with
    exception 2, dealt with in s. 85 (A) (3) and (4). Under (3),  exception
    2 applies in this case, because the  application  was  made  under  the
    points-based system. Under (4), the effect of that exception, so far as
    relevant to the present case, is that the Tribunal  may  only  consider
    evidence which

       "(a) was submitted in support of  and  at  the  time  of  making  the
       application to which the immigration decision relates;"

    unless it

       "(c) is adduced to prove that a document is genuine or valid."

11. It is common ground that the evidence with which we are  concerned  was
    not sent in with the application; so we cannot consider it under s. 85A
    (4) (a). So far as (4) (c) is concerned, Mr Hopkin argues that it  does
    not apply either here, since no previous document had been produced  by
    the appellant to show that he was entitled to be treated as  having  an
    'established presence'. Technically that is right, since what  he  said
    in  his  application  form  amounted  to  an  assertion,  rather   than
    documentary evidence: it might be true or untrue (though of  course  we
    know it was true); but there was no question of its being  "genuine  or
    valid"; or indeed the reverse. More generally it  might  be  said  that
    Parliament intended an appellant to be able to respond in an appeal  to
    an allegation of invalidity made for the first time in determining  the
    application.

Discussion

12. We are well aware of the mischief s.  85A  was  passed  to  put  right:
    appellants would often turn up at the hearing  of  their  appeals,  and
    produce documents which the Home Office  had  never  had  a  chance  to
    review or investigate, in which  case  either  the  appeal  had  to  be
    adjourned, never encouraged in this field, or allowed. That  particular
    mischief did not apply here, since the appellant's  grounds  of  appeal
    and supporting documents would have been sent to the Home  Office  well
    in advance of the hearing. However, Parliament did not legislate, as it
    might have done, to exempt evidence sent in with the grounds of appeal,
    but only what came with the application for leave itself.

13. The result is that, on a strict reading of s. 85A, the appellant is not
    entitled to rely on the evidence which would have established his  case
    on a point of which he  was  neither  warned  nor  informed,  until  he
    received the decision deciding it  against  him,  because  he  had  not
    submitted it with his own application.

14.  Nevertheless the appellant's treatment has been conspicuously  unfair.
    His application for leave to remain is being  refused  because  of  his
    failure to produce a document that he was never asked to produce;  that
    document only became relevant because of inquiries the respondent  made
    on the  application,  but  did  not  communicate  the  results  to  the
    appellant before the decision was made, or else  she  would  have  been
    made aware that the response from the appellant's previous college  was
    inaccurate. None of this would have mattered if s.85(4) had remained in
    force unaltered. We cannot imagine that Parliament intended to  produce
    so clearly unfair a result.

15. In our judgment the problem arises not with the terms of  the  section,
    which is in any event binding on us as primary  legislation,  but  with
    the conduct of the respondent in examining the application and refusing
    it in the way she did. Given that the respondent was  (or  should  have
    been) aware of the consequences of s. 85A when she made the decision in
    this case, the respondent is under a  common law duty to act fairly  in
    deciding immigration claims properly made to  her.  A  failure  to  act
    fairly is a failure to act in accordance  with the law and a failure to
     make a decision in accordance with the law is a ground  of  appeal  to
    the tribunal under s.84(1)(e) of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum
    Act 2002.

16. Two  recent  decisions  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  are  relevant:  Patel
    (revocation of sponsor licence - fairness) India [2011] UKUT 211  (IAC)
    and Thakur (PBS decision - 'common  law  fairness')  Bangladesh  [2011]
    UKUT 151 (IAC). Both dealt with the problem referred  to  in  the  long
    title of Patel, where a student's sponsoring college  has  its  licence
    revoked between the student's application, and an adverse  decision  on
    it, based on the revocation which the student could have known  nothing
    about.



17. The solution found in Thakur  was to declare that a decision  taken  in
    those circumstances was 'contrary to the law': the result was that  the
    appellant's application remained undecided, and he was to have a period
    of grace to put in a fresh one, naming  a  new  college  with  a  valid
    licence. The Tribunal in Patel  went into the question further,  making
    it clear at paragraph 28 that the general principle was this:

       "Where a judge finds that there was a duty to act fairly that has not
       been complied with in the particular circumstances of the case, he or
       she can allow the appeal on the basis that the  decision  is  not  in
       accordance with the law."

18. Both of these decisions were noted by Aikens LJ, writing for the  Court
    of Appeal in Sapkota [2011] EWCA Civ 1320, in the following paragraphs:

       "103. I would therefore hold that an argument that  an  "immigration
           decision" not to extend leave to remain is  flawed  because  the
           SSHD failed at the same time or promptly thereafter to  consider
           the question of whether or  not  to  make  a  removal  direction
           (either under section 10 of the 1999 Act, or more  appropriately
           in these cases, under section 47 of  the  2006  Act)  does  fall
           within the ambit of section 84(1)(e) of the 2002 Act. In  short,
           an unjustified deferral of the removal decision would mean  that
           the "immigration decision" actually taken is not "in  accordance
           with the law".
       104. At the hearing we were not shown any  other  authority  on  the
           construction of section 84(1)(e) or its  statutory  predecessors
           which would  preclude  this  conclusion  apart  from  Laws  LJ's
           statement in SA (Pakistan). In her further written  submissions,
           Ms Rhee accepted the general proposition  that  an  "immigration
           decision" can be impugned as not being "in accordance  with  the
           law" within section 84(1)(e) if the decision was taken in breach
           of public law principles, e.g. by failing to take into account a
           relevant consideration when making the decision.  She  submitted
           however that the ground of appeal in section 84(1)(e) could  not
           be used so as to widen the scope of an  "immigration  decisions"
           against which the right of appeal lies - so as  to  encompass  a
           complaint that the Secretary of State  had  failed  to  issue  a
           further consequential decision at the same time as the  decision
           under appeal. Mr Malik, in his written submissions, referred  us
           to decisions of the AIT and the  UT  which  all  state  that  an
           immigration decision can be challenged on the  section  84(1)(e)
           ground where it is alleged that the decision was made in  breach
           of public law principles.
       105. In my view, the construction of section 84(1)(e) I  propose  is
           preferable for four reasons. First, it would be consistent  with
           one of the statutory policies and  objects  of  the  immigration
           legislation which was reconfirmed by Sedley LJ in Mirza, viz. to
           enable the  courts  within  the  framework  of  the  immigration
           legislation to deal compendiously with all issues concerning the
           lawfulness of a person's continued residence in the  UK.  It  is
           logical that all issues should be dealt with in the  legislative
           context, rather than outside it."

19.   The  Court  of  Appeal  has  accordingly  confirmed   our   appellate
    jurisdiction to conclude that a particular decision is unfair,  and  so
    not in accordance with the law. Applying that to the  circumstances  of
    the present case, the decision is not in accordance with the  law,  and
    accordingly a lawful decision has yet to  be  made,  because  the  Home
    Office never put the appellant on notice that such  evidence  would  be
    required, or gave him any opportunity to answer  the  result  of  their
    inquiries with his college. There was nothing at all in the application
    form to show that the appellant needed to include documentary  evidence
    of his right to 'established presence'; and no chance of his  producing
    any evidence to contradict the result of the inquiries,  only  revealed
    in the decision itself.

20.  In these circumstances we do  not  need  to  explore  a  more  complex
    argument made in Sapkota itself, to the effect that  fairness  required
    the Secretary of State to make a removal decision at the same  time  as
    the extension  decision  with  the  consequences  that  the  rule  395C
    discretion would come into play. We would note that in such a case  the
    ACP  certificate  would  be  admissible  under  s.85A(4)(d),   as   the
    discretion  under  rule  395C   would  not  be  a  points-based  system
    discretion.

Conclusions

21. We emphasise that the scheme  of  s.85A  remains  undisturbed  by  this
    determination. Applicants for extension  of  leave  in  a  points-based
    system will need to read carefully the application form, and any lawful
    guidance associated with it, to ensure that they  supply  all  relevant
    information in the application  they  are  making.  Omissions  will  no
    longer be able to be corrected on appeal. An application is outstanding
    (and therefore information can be supplied to support it) until  it  is
    lawfully determined. Parliament enacted the exclusionary rule in  s.85A
    against the background of the Secretary of State's duty to act  fairly,
    and in the expectation that the duty would be complied with.

22. Where that duty has not been complied with, the Tribunal judge  can  so
    decide and allow the appeal on that ground. In such  cases  it  remains
    for the respondent to make a  lawful  decision  in  the  light  of  the
    Tribunal's determination and the information then available to her. The
    ACP  certificate  is  admissible  in  further  consideration  of   this
    application as the application remains outstanding and has  yet  to  be
    determined.

23. Since it is now accepted that the appellant was  entitled,  subject  to
    the admissibility of evidence to show it, to be treated  as  having  an
    'established presence'; and since there is no other reason for  refusal
    relied on, we should expect him now to be given the leave to remain for
    which he had  applied.  However,  our  legal  function  is  limited  to
    deciding that the decision under appeal was contrary to  law,  and  the
    appellant's application remains for decision by the Secretary of State.
