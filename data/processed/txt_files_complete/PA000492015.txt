                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

On 14 July 2015 the First-tier Tribunal gave  the  Appellant  permission  to
appeal the decision (hereinafter "the Decision") of the First-tier  Tribunal
promulgated on 23 June 2015 dismissing  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  a
decision of the Respondent to remove him from the United Kingdom.

The appeal was determined under "The Fast-track Rules" under  Schedule  Rule
1(3) to the Tribunal Procedure Rules 2014.

 By a Decision of the President of the First-tier Tribunal, Immigration  and
Asylum Chamber, under rule 32 of the Tribunal Procedure Rules 2014, sent  to
the parties on 18  August  2015,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  set  aside  the
Decision. The Decision was set aside following the decision of the Court  of
Appeal in The Lord Chancellor v Detention Action [2015] EWCA Civ 840.

 I saw no useful purpose in the Upper Tribunal making any reasoned  decision
on the appeal and I was minded to dismiss  the  appeal  without  considering
the merits.

A Memorandum and Directions setting out my view was sent to the  parties  on
2 September  2105  inviting  them  to  respond.  A  similar  Memorandum  and
Directions had been sent to the parties previously  but  the  Appellant  was
served at the wrong address.

There has been no response from either party.

I see no disadvantage to the Appellant  in  dismissing  his  appeal  to  the
Upper Tribunal. The First-tier Tribunal must re-determine his appeal.

In  the  circumstances  I  dismiss  the  Appellant's  appeal  to  the  Upper
Tribunal.

|Jonathan Perkins                     |                                     |
|Judge of the Upper Tribunal          |Dated 30 September 2015              |
