For the Appellant:     Mr Brown, Counsel instructed by Knightbridge
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of Somalia born in 2004.   This  appeal  is
    concerned with her application for  entry  clearance  to  come  to  the
    United Kingdom  to  settle  with  her  mother,  the  Sponsor  'S'.  The
    Respondent refused that application on the  14th  January  2019.    The
    only matter placed in issue is whether S has had "sole  responsibility"
    for her daughter.


 2. The Appellant appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  human  rights
    grounds.   The matter came before Judge Malik, who dismissed the appeal
    in a decision dated the 3rd December 2019. Permission to appeal to this
    Tribunal was sought, and was granted on the 3rd April 2020.  The matter
    came before me on the 11th January 2021, and by my decision of the  1st
    February 2021 I set the decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside.  The
    three principle errors of law I found are all reflected in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal's conclusion at its �30:

         "..this evidence does not  satisfy  me  that  the  sponsor  had/has
         continuing control and direction over  the  appellant's  upbringing
         given the limited evidence of this, nor that she made the important
         decisions in the  appellant's  life  as  inevitably  the  sponsor's
         brother from when the appellant was around the  age  of  3  onwards
         will have had day-to-day care for the appellant and other than  the
         sponsor's say so, there is no evidence to suggest she was  involved
         in any decision making whilst the appellant was in Somalia, such as
         choosing the appellant's school".

 3. The first error is in the Tribunal's approach to the  evidence  of  the
    Sponsor. There was nothing inherently improbable in S's testimony.  Nor
    was there any contradiction between her statements and  oral  evidence.
    The Tribunal nevertheless appeared to reject various assertions of fact
    - including the matter highlighted in this passage  -  because  it  was
    just the Sponsor's "say-so". Nowhere did the Tribunal give  any  reason
    why the Sponsor's oral evidence on these matters  should  be  rejected,
    nor why it was not on its own sufficient to  discharge  the  burden  of
    proof. The second error is highlighted in the added emphasis above. The
    fact that the Appellant was in her infancy provided  with  day  to  day
    care by another  relative  was  not  a  matter  in  itself  capable  of
    defeating   the   claim:   that   TD   (paragraph   297(i)(e):    'sole
    responsibility') Yemen [2006] UKAIT 00049.   The  third  error  was  in
    failing to consider the guidance in TD to the effect that paragraph 297
    does not require an applicant to prove that every  single  decision  in
    their life has been undertaken by the sponsor  in  the  UK.   The  term
    "responsibility" in the immigration rules should not to  be  understood
    as a theoretical or legal obligation but  rather  as  a  practical  one
    which, in each case, looks to who in fact is exercising  responsibility
    for the child.  Crucially, that responsibility "may  have  been  for  a
    short duration in that the present arrangements may  have  begun  quite
    recently".  As such the question of who chose  the  Appellant's  infant
    school in Somalia could not properly be treated as determinative of the
    decision in the appeal, given that more  recent  evidence  demonstrated
    S's current involvement in decisions about her education etc.


 4. In remaking the decision  I  heard  oral  evidence  from  S.  This  was
    entirely consistent with the written and oral evidence  she  has  given
    previously save that she updated the Tribunal on matters arising  since
    the matter came before the First-tier Tribunal.






    The Evidence/Preserved Findings

 5. The family history presented is as follows.  The  Appellant's  parents,
    both Somali nationals at  the  time  of  her  birth,  were  married  in
    Mogadishu in 2003. They were divorced before the Appellant was born  in
    October 2004.  S and the Appellant  lived  with  S's  brother  and  his
    family. Her father has played no role in her life. He was contacted for
    the purpose of the entry clearance application to confirm  this,  which
    he did. The First-tier Tribunal was satisfied that this was  true,  and
    that finding has been preserved.


 6. In 2007 S travelled to Yemen in order to work, leaving the Appellant in
    the care of her brother and sister-in-law.   She  did  so  because  the
    family were struggling to survive. Her brother was  poor  and  had  six
    children of his own.   S thought if she could find work  in  Yemen  she
    would be better able to help support the household.  During this period
    she regularly remitted money directly to  her  brother  and  maintained
    contact by use of calls  made  using  cheap  rate  telephone  cards  or
    prepaid SIMs. It was whilst S was in Yemen that she met the man who was
    to become her second husband. He had been recognised as  a  refugee  in
    the United Kingdom and after they married she travelled  here  to  live
    with him.   It is  S's  evidence  that  she  continued  to  financially
    support her daughter, and to take  all  material  decisions  about  her
    upbringing.  Her brother and sister-in-law continued to look after  the
    Appellant on her behalf. It is S's evidence that she has always  wanted
    to bring her daughter to live with her here, but her second husband was
    reluctant to support her. This caused difficulties between them and she
    has now in fact left him as a result.


 7. The Appellant's uncle died in 2017. Shortly thereafter his wife told  S
    that she could no longer care for the Appellant.  After  her  brother's
    death S made alternative  arrangements  for  the  Appellant.  A  family
    friend, a Mr Mohammad Mohammad Hussain, agreed to look  after  her.  He
    and S agreed that he would take the Appellant from  Somalia  to  Uganda
    where she would be able to attend boarding school.    Having  addressed
    itself to these facts the  First-tier Tribunal described Mr Hussain [at
    its �31] as the Appellant's "legal  guardian":  in  fact,  the  parties
    agree, there is no evidence at all to  support  a  conclusion  that  Mr
    Hussain has  somehow,  in  either  Somalia  or  Uganda,  assumed  legal
    responsibility for the Appellant. He can more properly be described  as
    her de facto guardian inasmuch as he is the adult who  brought  her  to
    Uganda and delivered her to boarding  school.    At  the  time  of  the
    appeal before the First-tier Tribunal this was the arrangement then  in
    place. However at the date that I remake the  appeal,  some  16  months
    later, the situation has changed again.

 8. In her most recent evidence S explains  that  during  2020  Mr  Hussain
    decided to return to Somalia - he told her that this was because he was
    "unable to stay in Uganda". I took this to mean because he  was  living
    there illegally, but it may have related to  some  other  practical  or
    emotional issue.   Before he left  Mr  Hussain  put  S  in  touch  with
    another family friend living in Uganda, a Mrs Fardowza Mukhtar Muhumad.
    This lady is now caring for the Appellant, because the boarding section
    of the school has closed and she is now  having  to  attend  as  a  day
    pupil.  S is now sending money directly to Fardowza for her  daughter's
    upkeep.

 9. At the time of the application for entry clearance S  had  returned  to
    Somalia on two occasions, spending about one month with her daughter in
    2015, and about two months in 2017.  She explained that  she  had  been
    unable to do this whilst she was in Yemen because she had  been  living
    there without immigration papers. After she came to the United  Kingdom
    there was further delay, first in obtaining her  British  passport  and
    then the documents required  to  get  into  Somalia.  More  recently  S
    visited her daughter in Uganda. She travelled at the beginning  of  the
    pandemic, in January 2020 and stayed there for two  months.  It  was  a
    very worrying time because the school closed its boarding  section  and
    Mr Hussain decided to return to Somalia. S had to take a decision about
    whether the Appellant went with him. She did not want her  daughter  to
    go to Somalia. Its dangerous there, especially for young women, who are
    assaulted or raped by bad people  like  al-Shabaab.  S  would  be  very
    worried for her if she lived in Somalia - she worries for her in Uganda
    but Somalia is much worse. S decided that the Appellant should stay  in
    Uganda, and carry on attending school as a day pupil.  She  would  live
    with Fardowza and her child.     The  bundle  contains  photographs  of
    mother and daughter taken during that trip.


10. In respect of the Appellant's school the oral evidence of S was that it
    cost her about US $50 per month for the actual schooling, plus  it  had
    been an additional US $200 for the boarding  fees.  The  Appellant  has
    been unhappy there. She sees the  other  children  arriving/going  home
    with their families and she feels alone, and  lonely.  She  misses  her
    mother and often cries during their daily telephone calls.  The  school
    is called the Katwe Noor Islamic School. It has provided  two  letters,
    both addressed to S. The first is dated the 23rd August 2019.  It  says
    that the Appellant is in good condition and is happy there  except  she
    "always misses her parents". In light of the preserved finding that the
    Appellant's father has played no role in her life I treat  this  plural
    as a typographical error.   The second is dated the 1st February  2000.
    This letter corroborates S's evidence that  the  boarding  section  was
    then closing down.  The author, headteacher Kigozi Arafat, adds: "On  a
    sad note, she was not happy with her life here in  Uganda  without  her
    mother, she was pleading that she  was  in  need  of  her  family".   A
    separate document  outlines  the  fee  structure:  having  used  online
    currency tool OANDA to converted the  Ugandan  shillings  shown  to  US
    dollars Mr Bates was satisfied that this was  broadly  consistent  with
    S's oral evidence about the costs.   The bundle contains  receipts  for
    payment issued by the school, and money transfer receipts showing S  to
    be sending money to Uganda in varying monthly amounts of  between  �320
    and �400.   At the beginning of 2020 these were to Mr Hussain; from May
    onwards they were to Fardowza Muhumad.


11. In respect of contact it was the oral evidence of  S  that  this  takes
    place using whatsapp and other free social  media  messaging  services.
    She last spoke with the Appellant on the morning of the  hearing.  They
    speak at least  once  per  day,  sometimes  more.    The  Appellant  is
    frequently upset during these calls. She is getting older and needs her
    mum to be there for her and explain the changes that are  happening  to
    her as she gets older. These things are difficult by telephone.


12. The Entry Clearance Officer took no issue about the  ability  of  S  to
    adequately maintain and accommodate her daughter. Before  me  Mr  Bates
    was  satisfied  that  this  remained  the  position.   I   had   sought
    clarification, since there has been a material change  in  circumstance
    in that S has now left her husband, but Mr Bates was satisfied  on  the
    documentary evidence produced that S is, as she claims,  working  three
    jobs in order to support  this  application:  she  has  produced  P60s,
    employer's letters,  payslips and bank statements. These show  that  in
    the last tax year she earned �8829 from Mitie Limited, �4856  from  ISS
    United Kingdom Ltd and �6569 from Essential Hygiene  Ltd.     Her  most
    recent bank statement shows a balance of over �10,000.

13. I now proceed to set this evidence against the applicable  legal  test.
    Before I  do  so  it  is  appropriate  to  note  that  having  had  the
    opportunity to hear directly from S I found her to be a wholly credible
    witness. Her evidence has been consistent, both internally and with the
    documentary evidence produced.


    Legal Analysis and Findings


14. On the 17th August 2018 the Appellant made an application for leave  to
    enter as the child of a  person  present  and  settled  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  Although  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's   decision   makes
    reference to the section of Appendix FM concerned with applications  to
    join a parent with  limited  leave  to  remain,   the  parties  are  in
    agreement that the relevant part of the Immigration Rules is  still  to
    be found at paragraph 297:  S has had,  at all material times,  settled
    status since she became  a  British  citizen  since  2013.  The  single
    ground for refusal was that the Appellant had not demonstrated  that  S
    -her  biological  mother  -  has  had  "sole  responsibility"  for  her
    upbringing.   The burden in proving this matter lies on  the  Appellant
    and it must be discharged on  the  civil  standard  of  a  'balance  of
    probabilities'.


15. The leading guidance on the meaning of "sole responsibility" remains TD
    (Yemen):


         "Sole responsibility" is a factual matter to be  decided  upon  all
         the evidence.  Where one parent is  not  involved  in  the  child's
         upbringing  because  he  (or  she)  had  abandoned   or   abdicated
         responsibility, the issue may arise between  the  remaining  parent
         and others who have day-to-day care of the child abroad.  The  test
         is whether the parent has continuing control and direction over the
         child's upbringing, including making all the important decisions in
         the child's life.  However, where both parents are  involved  in  a
         child's upbringing, it will be exceptional that one  of  them  will
         have "sole responsibility".


16. At its �52 the Tribunal expands on this guidance:

         Questions of "sole  responsibility"  under  the  immigration  rules
         should be approached as follows:


           i) Who has "responsibility" for a child's upbringing and  whether
              that responsibility is  "sole"  is  a  factual  matter  to  be
              decided upon all the evidence.


          ii) The term "responsibility" in the immigration rules should  not
              to be understood as a  theoretical  or  legal  obligation  but
              rather as a practical one which, in each case, looks to who in
              fact  is  exercising  responsibility  for  the  child.    That
              responsibility may have been for a short duration in that  the
              present arrangements may have begun quite recently.

         iii) "Responsibility" for a child's upbringing may be undertaken by
              individuals other than a child's parents  and  may  be  shared
              between different individuals: which  may  particularly  arise
              where the child remains in its own  country  whilst  the  only
              parent involved in its life travels to and lives in the UK.

          iv) Wherever the parents are, if both parents are involved in  the
              upbringing of the child, it will be exceptional  that  one  of
              them will have sole responsibility.

           v) If it is said that  both  are  not  involved  in  the  child's
              upbringing, one of the indicators for that will  be  that  the
              other has abandoned or abdicated his responsibility.  In  such
              cases, it may well be justified to find that  that  parent  no
              longer has responsibility for the child.

          vi) However, the issue of sole responsibility is not just a matter
              between the parents.  So even if  there  is  only  one  parent
              involved in the child's upbringing, that parent may  not  have
              sole responsibility.

         vii)   In   the   circumstances   likely   to   arise,   day-to-day
              responsibility (or decision-making) for  the  child's  welfare
              may necessarily be shared with others (such  as  relatives  or
              friends) because of the geographical  separation  between  the
              parent and child.

        viii) That,  however,  does  not  prevent  the  parent  having  sole
              responsibility within the meaning of the Rules.

          ix)  The  test  is,  not  whether  anyone  else   has   day-to-day
              responsibility, but whether the parent has continuing  control
              and direction of the child's upbringing including  making  all
              the  important  decisions  in  the  child's  life.   If   not,
              responsibility is shared and so not "sole".

17. It was the finding of the First-tier Tribunal that the only parent  who
    has been involved in the Appellant's upbringing is S.   It also appears
    to be accepted that S does  have  at  least  some  involvement  in  her
    daughter's life - that this is so might be evident from the  fact  that
    she sponsors this application, but beyond that there is the evidence of
    remittances, the photographs of the visit and the  correspondence  from
    the school, as well as the credible oral evidence of S herself.


18.  The  issue  however  arises  as  to  whether  S  has  exercised  'sole
    responsibility' in the context of the  rule,  or  whether  she  has  in
    effect abdicated some of that responsibility to other carers  - to  her
    brother and his wife, to Mr Hussain  and  now  to  Fardowza.  I  remind
    myself that even if S is  the  only  parent  involved  in  the  child's
    upbringing, she may not have sole responsibility. The test  is  whether
    she as a parent has had control  and  direction  over  the  Appellant's
    upbringing, including making the important  decisions  in  the  child's
    life.    My findings on that matter are as follows.

19. I accept that when S travelled to Yemen in 2007 she did so in order  to
    work.   Her evidence that her family  were  living  in  dire  financial
    circumstances is  consistent  with  the  circumstances  known  by  this
    Tribunal to have existed in that country then: see for  instance  HH  &
    others (Mogadishu: armed conflict: risk) Somalia CG [2008] UKAIT 00022.
     I found her evidence on this matter to be credible. It has  been  this
    Tribunal's long experience in hearing cases involving Somali  nationals
    that many parents have become dislocated from their children by war and
    poverty. The arrangements entered into by these family members  are  in
    no way atypical.   I am satisfied that when S went to Yemen as the sole
    parent of her daughter it would have been she who decided to leave  her
    in the care of her brother and his wife. I accept that she continued to
    send money home, because that was  the  purpose  of  her  migration.  I
    accept that she would continue to do so because it would have  been  in
    her daughter's best interest. I am unable to make a finding on  whether
    S was during this period of her daughter's early life having continuing
    "control and direction" over her  - given her young age  it  seems  the
    opportunities to do so would necessarily have been  limited.   A  young
    child simply needs love and sustenance day to day  -  this  would  have
    been provided by her uncle and aunt.

20. That uncertainty  does  not  however  matter  for  the  purpose  of  my
    decision. That is because it is quite clear on the evidence  before  me
    that at least since 2017 when her brother died it is S who has been  in
    control of all of the major decisions in the Appellant's life.  On  the
    balance of  probabilities  I  am  satisfied  that  when  the  Appellant
    travelled to Uganda in order to go to boarding school she did so at the
    request of her mother - and financial provider - rather than because Mr
    Hussain, a family friend, decided that it would be a  good  idea.    No
    alternative explanation is offered as to why this man  would  elect  to
    take over the care and control of a 12 year old and decide to place her
    in boarding school in another country. The most likely  explanation  is
    the one that is offered on the evidence: he did so at the request of S,
    a family friend.  Similarly I can see no reason to reject the  evidence
    about the current position, that Fardowza has now taken over  the  role
    played by Mr Hussain.   I entirely accept Mr Bates' point that it would
    have been immensely helpful to have had some evidence from Mr  Hussain,
    or Fardowza, or the Appellant herself who is  now  14  years  old.  Its
    absence is however not fatal to the appeal.   The  overall  account  is
    plausible, and on the evidence before me, demonstrated on balance to be
    true.


21. As I observed at hearing, had the initial arrangement persisted, it  is
    in my view doubtful that  the  Appellant  could  today  succeed  in  an
    application under paragraph 297. Had she remained  with  her  aunt  and
    uncle, the arrangement originally conceived as temporary and  necessary
    would, over the years, perhaps inevitably have drawn  closer  to  a  de
    facto adoption.   The  death  of  S's  brother  changed  all  of  that.
    Although no death certificate has been produced, there  was  clearly  a
    dramatic change in circumstances post 2017 in that  the  Appellant  was
    taken to Uganda:  I am therefore prepared to accept the  oral  evidence
    is in itself capable of discharging the burden of proof on this  point.
      Since the Appellant arrived in Uganda  there  is  a  clear  chain  of
    command that can be traced between mother and daughter. When the school
    communicates, it does so with  mother,  albeit  acknowledging  her  in-
    country guardian. Numerous remittances, for what  are  substantial  and
    regular sums, are produced. S has now visited her daughter three times,
    and given wholly credible oral evidence about the choices she was faced
    with at the outset of the pandemic. It was she  who  decided  that  her
    daughter was to stay in Uganda rather than risk going back  to  Somalia
    with Mr Hussain. It was she who placed the Appellant with Fardowza  and
    decided she  should  remain  at  the  Katwe  Noor  school  despite  her
    unhappiness.  These are important decisions in  the  Appellant's  life,
    and I am satisfied that no adult other than her mother is able to  take
    them.     It follows that on the balance of probabilities the Appellant
    has discharged the burden of proof and the appeal is allowed.

    Anonymity Order

22. The Appellant is a child.  Having had regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  and  the  Presidential  Guidance
    Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders I therefore consider it appropriate
    to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"


    Decision and Directions


23. The appeal is  allowed  on  human  rights  grounds  with  reference  to
    paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules.


24. There is an order for anonymity.
