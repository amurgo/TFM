                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr J Chaudry, of Latta & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    David C Clapham SSC, promulgated on 8  February  2017,  dismissing  his
    appeal against refusal of asylum.

 2. The appellant states 3 grounds.

 3. The first, "use of speculation", is directed against  the  findings  at
    �40 that it  was  incredible  that  the  appellant  would  be  given  a
    telephone warning of an attempt to be made on his life or that the paid
    assassin would telephone him to gloat after the failed attempt.

 4. The second, "failure to  consider  all  the  evidence  and  failure  to
    provide clear reasoning", says  that  the  judge  gave  no  reason  for
    rejecting evidence about  tribal  feuds,  or  about  a  document  about
    threats to his life, and that "should  therefore  have  been  taken  at
    highest".  The ground refers to  evidence  about  how  Kurds  might  be
    traced; a tribal deal for the appellant's departure from Iraq; and risk
    arising from breaking that agreement, if he  were  to  return  -  which
    evidence was  either  overlooked,  or  no  clear  reasoning  given  for
    rejecting it.

 5. Ground 3, "incorrect application of the standard of proof",  says  that
    the judge made no finding about the authenticity of a letter  from  the
    Ministry of the Peshmerga, which "should therefore have been  taken  at
    highest", and that "in failing to  apply  the  low  standard  of  proof
    correctly the judge erred in law  ...  this  appellant  has  more  than
    discharged the burden of proof".

 6. (That proposition appears to suggest that the decision was  irrational,
    and should be reversed; but the grounds conclude by seeking a remit  to
    the FtT.)

 7. In a rule  24  response  the  SSHD  says  that  under  the  heading  of
    speculation the grounds are mere disagreement, identifying no error  of
    law; the finding was open on the evidence; and the case referred to  in
    the grounds is irrelevant.  The reply further argues  that  failure  to
    take account of evidence about the likelihood of tracing is immaterial,
    as at �44 - 46 the judge clearly found there had been  no  attempts  or
    threats on the appellant's life.

 8. Mrs O'Brien maintained the position that grounds 1 and  2  disclose  no
    error of law, but  conceded  that  ground  3  discloses  a  failure  to
    consider a document the assessment of which was incumbent on the judge;
    that in the absence of such  assessment,  it  could  not  be  said  the
    outcome could safely stand; and the case should therefore  be  remitted
    to the FtT.

 9. Mr Chaudry was content with that outcome.

10. The ground of appeal is incorrectly framed in terms of the standard  of
    proof, and of the implications  of  the  error;  but  the  respondent's
    concession recognises the nature of the oversight.

11. Of consent, the decision of the FtT is set aside. None of its  findings
    are to stand, other than as a record of what was said at  the  hearing.
    The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.  The member(s)
    of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include Judge David C
    Clapham SSC.

12. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
