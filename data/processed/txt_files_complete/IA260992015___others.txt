Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr A Adewoye of Prime Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   These are linked appeals against the decisions of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Amin promulgated on 30 November 2016 allowing each of the appeals
    of the Appellants against decisions of the Respondent dated 7 July 2015
    refusing indefinite leave  to  remain  and  making  removal  directions
    pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act
    2006.


2.   Although before me the Secretary of State  is  the  Appellant  and  the
    members of the Abulatan family are the Respondents,  for  the  sake  of
    consistency with proceedings before the  First-tier  Tribunal  I  shall
    hereafter refer to the Secretary of State as  the  Respondent  and  the
    members of the Abulatan family as the Appellants.  Indeed, for the main
    part I shall be making reference to the First Appellant as  the  issues
    in this appeal as they presently stand  essentially  focus  around  her
    circumstances and her economic activity: accordingly  references  below
    to the Appellant are to the First Appellant unless otherwise indicated.


3.   The personal details of the Appellants are a matter of record  on  file
    and it is unnecessary for me to set them out in detail here.


4.   The principal Appellant, accompanied by her family, entered the  United
    Kingdom in January 2010 with entry clearance  as  a  Tier  1  (General)
    Migrant with leave valid until  24 September  2012.   On  12  September
    2012 she made an application for further  leave  to  remain  which  was
    granted on 13 February 2013 valid until 13 February  2015.   The  other
    Appellants were  granted  leave  in  line.   On  4  February  2015  the
    Appellant applied for indefinite  leave  to  remain.   The  Appellant's
    application was refused for reasons set out in a 'reasons for  refusal'
    letter  ('RFRL')  dated  7  July  2015  with  reference  to  paragraphs
    245CD(b), 322(1A), and 322(2) of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  other
    Appellants were refused 'in-line' with reference to paragraph  319J  of
    the Immigration Rules.


5.   The basis of the Respondent's decision  in  respect  of  the  Appellant
    related to the information that she had provided in connection with the
    application for variation of leave made on 12 September 2012.   It  was
    noted in the RFRL that in the  context  of  that  application  she  had
    stated that her previous earnings for the period from 1 September  2011
    to 31 August 2012 totalled �35,059.43.  The Appellant had submitted  an
    accountant's letter, profit and losses  accounts  and  other  documents
    including invoices, national insurance payments,  bank  statements  and
    payslips. In particular, in support of her declaration  of  income  the
    Appellant had submitted accounts prepared on her behalf by  a  firm  of
    accountants under cover of  letter  dated  10  September  2012.   Those
    accounts  are  drafted  in  a  form  consistent  with  the  Appellant's
    declaration and, as stated in the  RFRL  "showed  that  you  had  total
    income of �17,646.00  from  self  employed  earnings";  the  RFRL  also
    observes "the payslips and bank statements showed employed earnings  of
    �17,413.43".

6.   The Respondent, however, in  the  course  of  considering  the  current
    application made checks with Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs in respect
    of the Appellant's declared earnings.  The HMRC checks  turned  up  the
    following information.  For the tax year from 6 April 2011 to  5  April
    2012 the Appellant declared to the Revenue an income from employment of
    �17,010 and income from self-employment of  �292,  making  a  total  of
    �17,302.  For the tax year 6 April 2012 to 5 April 2013 she declared to
    the Revenue an income of �17,368, but a loss in respect  of  her  self-
    employment of �812.   Putting  these  two  sources  of  information  in
    respect of the tax declarations together, the  Respondent  reached  the
    conclusion that it could not possibly  have  been  the  case  that  the
    Appellant had earned from self-employment in  the  period  1  September
    2011 to 31 August 2012 �17,646 as claimed.  Indeed, for  the  whole  of
    the 24 month period between April 2011 and April 2013 she only declared
    profits of �292 from self-employment, and additionally had  declared  a
    loss of �812.


7.   In consequence the Respondent came to this conclusion:

         "It is considered that the self-employed earnings on your  previous
         Tier 1 application were fabricated to present yourself  as  someone
         eligible to meet the requirements of the Tier 1 Rules."


8.   In those circumstances the Secretary of State invoked paragraph  322(2)
    in respect of the past application.  The Respondent also took the  view
    that in such circumstances no reliance could be placed on the materials
    now presented in support of  the  current  application  for  indefinite
    leave to remain and accordingly invoke paragraph 322(1A) in respect  of
    the information submitted with the current application.




9.   In the context of the issues that  now  arise  in  the  appeal,  in  my
    judgement it is important to be clear as to the implication  -  or  the
    role - of both the HMRC returns for  2011/2012  and  2012/2013  in  the
    Respondent's analysis and reasoning.  It may be seen that if it were to
    be assumed that the �292 declared in the 2011/2012 tax returns had  all
    been earned during the period covered by  the  Appellant's  declaration
    for 1 September 2011 to 31 August 2012, i.e. from 1 September 2011 to 5
    April 2012, then it would have been necessary for the Appellant to have
    earned an additional �17,354 in the remaining period from 6 April  2012
    until 31 August 2012 to bring her up to her declared total of  �17,646.
    Yet for the whole of the twelve month period  from  6  April  2012  the
    Appellant declared a loss of �812.  If it were to be assumed  that  she
    did indeed earn something from self  employment  during  2012/2013  but
    later made a loss, it would be necessary for her in effect to show that
    she had made a loss of �18,166 between 31 August 2012 and 5 April  2013
    to be able to make a declaration to the Revenue of a loss over the  tax
    year of �812.

10.  As I say, the relevance of both of the HMRC returns is critical to  the
    Respondent's reasoning: reasoning  which  on  its  face  stands  up  to
    scrutiny.


11.  The Appellant lodged an appeal against the decision of the  Respondent.
    In  her  grounds  of  appeal  she  offered  the  following  by  way  of
    explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the  declaration  made
    in her application in 2012 and the declarations she had made  to  HMRC.
    It was pleaded:

         "Appellant earned more money after the tax returns and so could not
         be included in the tax calculations to the HMRC".


12.  I quite simply do not understand that pleading.  If  it  was  the  case
    that the Appellant had  earned  more  money  after  her  2011/2012  tax
    return, then that would have shown in the  subsequent  tax  return  for
    2012/2013 - but it quite simply does not given that the figures are  as
    I have indicated.


13.  Before the First-tier Tribunal the Appellant  relied  in  part  upon  a
    letter  from  her  accountant  identifying  that  the  period  of   the
    declaration in the 2012 application was  not  congruent  with  the  tax
    year.  That is factually correct; but again it seems to  me  that  when
    both tax years are viewed in combination that such an explanation  does
    not begin to explain the discrepancies in the figures.


14.  Be that as it may, the Appellant succeeded on  her  appeal  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal under the Immigration Rules.  In such circumstances
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge declined to give consideration to Article
    8, which had been raised in the alternative.


15.  The Respondent sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  which
    was granted on  12  June  2017  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Grant-
    Hutchison stating in material part: "It is arguable that the Judge  has
    erred in law by failing to make any findings in  relation  to  the  tax
    year 2012/13."  Indeed, Mr Adewoye on behalf of  the  Appellants  today
    during the course of submissions ultimately accepted that the Judge had
    indeed made no  findings  on,  or  indeed  reference  to,  the  Revenue
    accounts for the tax year 2012/2013.  It seems to me  that  this  is  a
    significant concession because, as I have indicated above, the basis of
    the  Respondent's  reasoning  is  premised  upon   a   combination   of
    considering the Revenue returns for both 2011/2012 and 2012/2013.


16.  To that extent, and in any event, in  my  judgment  there  is  a  clear
    error at paragraph 12 of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal.   In
    material part that paragraph is in these terms:

         "In refusing the current  application  the  Respondent  reviewed  a
         previous application dated 12 September 2012  where  the  Appellant
         had  stated  that  she  had  earnings   of   �35,059.43   but   the
         documentation submitted  with  that  application  showed  that  the
         Appellant only had an income of �17,646 from self-employed work and
         �17,413.43 from employed work.  On this  basis  the  Appellant  was
         awarded 40 points for total earnings.  However, a HMRC check showed
         that the actual income for the period 1 September 2011 to 31 August
         2012 was �17,010 from employment and �292 from self-employed  work.
         The Respondent was not satisfied in the  light  of  these  previous
         declarations that the Appellant had made true  declaration  of  her
         income on the current application."




17.  The HMRC check did not show that the actual income  for  the  period  1
    September 2011 to 31 August 2012 was �17,010 from employment  and  �292
    from self-employment.  It  is  absolutely  clear  that  the  Judge  has
    fundamentally misunderstood the basis of the Respondent's reasoning  in
    this regard. This is both evidenced by and compounded by the failure to
    make any reference to the HMRC return for 2012/2013.  Necessarily  this
    means that the consideration of the appeal by the  First-tier  Tribunal
    was on  a  fundamentally  erroneous  footing,  and  I  find  that  that
    circumstance in itself would warrant the setting aside of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal.


18.  The Judge then goes on at paragraph 13 to refer to the letter from  the
    Appellant's accountant in respect of the different periods  upon  which
    the declaration and the tax returns were  based  and  states  that  the
    letter "clearly sets out why the different accounting  periods  led  to
    the discrepancy".  For the reasons I have already given it seems to  me
    that  the  different  accounting  periods  in  no   way   explain   the
    discrepancy. I find that the Judge's misunderstanding of the nature  of
    the case has clearly been material in the erroneous analysis set out at
    paragraph 13.


19.  Again, at paragraph 14 the Judge makes reference  to  the  tax  returns
    for the  period  2011/2012  and  sets  those  against  the  Appellant's
    declaration for earnings from 1 September 2011 to 31 August 2012 -  but
    fails to identify the relevance of  the  subsequent  tax  year  to  the
    reasoning of the Respondent. The Tribunal thereby  failed  to  identify
    matters to which it should properly have had regard in  conducting  its
    own independent evaluation of the appeals.


20.  I am further satisfied that the Judge fell into further error over  the
    course of paragraphs 15 and 16 of the decision.  Those  paragraphs  are
    in these terms:

         "15. In addition,  I  have  seen  the  audited  accounts  from  the
             accountants for the period 1 September 2011 to 31 August  2012
             which certifies that the Appellant's income from  this  period
             was �35,059.43.


         16.  On the basis of this  information  I  am  satisfied  that  the
             Appellant  did  not  make  false  declarations  in  her   2012
             application.   There  are  clearly  two  different  accounting
             periods in play.  The Appellant has provided audited  accounts
             for the period in question; her payslips;  HMRC  tax  returns;
             P60s and her bank statements to  corroborate  the  income  she
             stated she earned."




21.  The audited accounts from the accountants for the  period  1  September
    2011 to 31 August 2012 referred to by the Judge at paragraph 15 are the
    very accounts that the Appellant had submitted with her application  in
    2012 which the Respondent now implicitly rejected as being part of  the
    Appellant's  fabrication  of  her  income  at  that  time.    In   such
    circumstances, the very accounts that are in substantial issue in these
    proceedings cannot in and of themselves stand as probative as to  their
    own validity.  The Judge clearly took these  accounts  into  favourable
    consideration because he states at the beginning of paragraph  16  that
    it was "[o]n the basis of this information" that he was satisfied  that
    the Appellant did not make false declarations.  Moreover, later  on  in
    paragraph 16 in setting out the materials provided by the Appellant  he
    again reiterates that she provided audited accounts for the  period  in
    question.  This is a fundamental and serious error such as  to  warrant
    the setting aside of the decision.


22.  The Judge's reasoning at paragraph  16  is,  in  my  judgment,  further
    unsustainable in the following respects.  It is to be  noted  that  the
    real contentious issue here was in respect  of  the  Appellant's  self-
    employment.  As such the payslips which were from employment  were  not
    probative one way or the  other  in  respect  of  the  issue  of  self-
    employment; nor were the P60s.  As far as the bank statements that were
    before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  it  is  apparent  that  those   bank
    statements related to the year 2014  and  had  been  submitted  in  the
    context of the current application.  They were not bank statements that
    related to the contentious period for which the Appellant had made  her
    declaration in her 2012  application.   Accordingly  they  were  of  no
    relevance in determining the particular issue in this appeal. The Judge
    placed reliance on materials that were not relevant to the issue.


23.  That only then  really  leaves  the  Judge's  reference  to  "HMRC  tax
    returns". The First-tier Tribunal's Decision is silent  in  respect  of
    any reasons as to how such  returns  supported  the  Appellant's  case.
    Nonetheless I note that in this regard it is said  that  the  Appellant
    has, since the Respondent's decision, made  retrospective  declarations
    to  the  Revenue  seeking,  it  is   said,   in   effect   to   correct
    misdeclarations  made  previously  for  the   periods   2011/2012   and
    2012/2013.  This necessarily begs the question that is at the heart  of
    this appeal rather than answering that question.


24.  The Appellant's claim in respect of the retrospective  declarations  to
    the HMRC might rightly be considered with some suspicion  in  light  of
    the substance of the Respondent's decision and their timing.  Her  case
    has now become that she  had  misdeclared  her  income  to  the  Inland
    Revenue in the years 2011/2012 and 2012/2013. Her case was not remotely
    formulated in this way in her original grounds, and to that  end  would
    require substantially more by way of supporting evidence  in  order  to
    establish that she had misdeclared her income  to  the  Revenue  rather
    than misdeclaring her income to the Home Office.


25.  Moreover  the  substance  of  the  Appellant's  case  -  that  she  had
    correctly declared her income to the Respondent in her  application  of
    12 September 2012 but had wrongly declared her income  to  the  HMRC  -
    formed no part of the First-tier Tribunal Judge's reasoning.  Nor  were
    any  independently  verifiable  materials  in  respect  of  her   self-
    employment between 1 September 2011 and 31 August 2013 before the First-
    tier Tribunal.


26.  I am entirely satisfied  notwithstanding  the  forceful  urging  of  Mr
    Adewoye that the First-tier Tribunal  fundamentally  misunderstood  the
    basis of the Respondent's decision and thereby erroneously  had  regard
    to irrelevant matters  and  failed  to  consider  relevant  matters  in
    evaluating the Appellants' case.


27.  The inevitable consequence is  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal must be set aside.   The  decision  in  the  appeal  therefore
    requires to be remade.  I have reached the conclusion that it would  be
    appropriate to remake the decision before  a  different  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal with all issues at  large.   This  will  allow  the
    Appellant  a  further  opportunity  to  file  all  relevant  supporting
    evidence in respect of her economic activity and in particular her self-
    employment during the period 1 September 2011 and 31 August  2012  that
    might support her contention that she made a genuine declaration to the
    Respondent as to her income.  It may  also  afford  the  Appellant  the
    opportunity to provide further clarification as to the basis upon which
    she made successive misdeclarations to HMRC.  In this context it might,
    for example, be helpful to see  what  materials  she  provided  to  her
    accountants in each of  those  tax  years  if  they  were  involved  in
    assisting her in preparing her returns.   It  is  equally  relevant  to
    consider what material she provided to her accountants  in  support  of
    the audited accounts submitted in the application of September 2012.
28.  Although the focus here has been in respect of  the  2012  application,
    it is not to be forgotten that the Respondent has also raised issues in
    respect  of  the  genuineness  and  authenticity  of  the   Appellant's
    declarations as to income in the context of the 2015 application.  This
    will also need to be addressed in a similarly rigorous manner, both  by
    way of the filing of evidence and  the  careful  consideration  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal.


29.  In circumstances where the appeal is to be remitted  it  is  of  course
    then available  for  the  Appellant  again  to  pursue  the  Article  8
    arguments in the alternative. As I have  noted  above,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal gave no consideration to this aspect of the appeal and made no
    findings.  Indeed it is the absence of any consideration to this aspect
    of the appeal that persuades me that the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  the
    appropriate forum for remaking the decisions in the appeals.


30.  I do not propose  to  make  any  specific  Directions  in  the  appeal:
    standard directions will suffice. However, the Appellant is  on  notice
    of the need to provide independently verifiable evidence of her claimed
    level of earnings from self-employment i.e. evidence that  goes  beyond
    any self-reported figures offered to her accountants and HMRC, such  as
    contracts,  correspondence   with   clients/customers,   invoices   and
    receipts, bank statements etc.. The Appellant should be aware  that  it
    is open to the Tribunal in remaking the decisions  in  the  appeals  to
    draw adverse inferences from any failure to provide supporting evidence
    that might reasonably be expected to be available to her.


Notice of Decisions

30.  The decisions of the First-tier Tribunal contained material  errors  of
    law and are set aside.


31.  The decisions in the appeals are to be remade before any Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Amin with  all
    issues at large.


32.  No anonymity directions are sought or made.

The above represents a corrected transcript of ex tempore reasons  given  at
the conclusion of the hearing.
