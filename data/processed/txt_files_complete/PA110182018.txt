For the Appellant:     Mr Joseph, instructed by Crowley and Co
For the Respondent:    Mr Howells, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1.     The appellant was born on 1 December 1974 and is a female  citizen
      of Iraq. Her ethnicity is Kurdish. Her home city in Iraq is Erbil, the
      de facto capital  of  the  Independent  Kurdish  Region  (IKR).  By  a
      decision promulgated on 15 September 2019, Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge
      Davey found that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in  law  such  that
      its decision fell to be set aside. The judge directed that there be  a
      resumed hearing in the Upper Tribunal which took place at Cardiff on 5
      December 2019. The only issue  remaining  to  be  determined  is  that
      concerning the appeal on Article 8  ECHR  grounds.  The  Deputy  Upper
      Tribunal Judge did not disturb the First-tier Tribunal's findings  and
      the appellant's appeal on asylum  and  Article  3  ECHR  grounds.  The
      proceedings were anonymised in the First-tier Tribunal but not at  the
      initial hearing in the Upper Tribunal. No application was made  to  me
      for anonymity nor can I identify any reason to anonymise the appeal.

   2.   The appellant applied for a visa to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  in
      January 2017. That application was  refused.  In  December  2017,  the
      appellant travelled to France and Spain before returning to Iraq.  She
      left Iraq on 20 February 2018 travelling to Turkey by taxi.  She  then
      travelled by lorry to the  United  Kingdom  and  entered  the  country
      clandestinely on 5 March 2018. She claimed asylum the  following  day.
      The appellant claims that she met Kefi Omar (the sponsor) in 2014. She
      married the sponsor on 16 October 2016. The sponsor is  a  naturalised
      British citizen of Iraqi origin. The couple live together  in  Cardiff
      where the sponsor has a grocery business.

   3.    I heard evidence from both the appellant and the sponsor. Both gave
      their evidence with the assistance of a  Kurdish  Sorani  interpreter.
      The oral evidence of the sponsor was interrupted by the appellant  who
      was in court having given her own evidence. The appellant appeared  to
      prompt the sponsor to give a particular answer to a  question  put  in
      cross examination and which concerned the level of contact  which  the
      sponsor maintains with his family members in Iraq. The intervention of
      the appellant was unacceptable but, for reasons which I give below,  I
      accept that the sponsor and appellant are currently  in  a  subsisting
      relationship.

   4.   The standard proof in  the  Article  8  appeal  is  the  balance  of
      probabilities. In her evidence, the appellant explained that  she  did
      not have contact with her own family in Iraq. She  did  not  know  how
      many employees worked for her husband's business. She  did  know  that
      the business was doing well and that the sponsor has savings.  In  his
      evidence, the sponsor explained that  he  has  two  brothers  and  two
      sisters living in the IKR. He claims  to  have  limited  contact  with
      those relatives. The sponsor stated that he runs a  grocery  shop  and
      has two part-time workers. He has savings of between �4000-�5000.

   5.   Both the appellant and sponsor were asked in  cross-examination  why
      they would be unable to live together in the IKR. The  appellant  said
      that her husband had established his life  here  and  that  he  had  a
      business. He would be unable to establish  a  business  in  Iraq.  The
      sponsor gave similar  evidence;  he  was  reluctant  to  give  up  his
      business and start again elsewhere.

   6.    I accept that the sponsor and  appellant  are  living  together  as
      husband and wife in a subsisting relationship.  There  is  documentary
      evidence that they are jointly responsible for household utilities and
      no issue been taken with the  validity  of  the  marriage  certificate
      produced. The evidence which each gave about  their  daily  lives  was
      broadly consistent. The fact  that  they  are  seeking  treatment  for
      infertility  also  strongly  suggests  the  existence  of  a   genuine
      relationship.

   7.     Subject that finding, I have considered whether the  appellant  is
      able to satisfy any of the requirements  required  under  HC  395  (as
      amended). Mr Joseph, who appeared for the  appellant,  submitted  that
      the appellant should be considered under  Appendix  FM  for  leave  to
      remain as a partner. It is not disputed that the sponsor has an income
      which meets the financial requirements nor, in his submission,  should
      the appellant be excluded by the provisions of E-LTRP 2.1 or 2.2:

      E-LTRP.2.1. The applicant must not be in the UK-

      (a) as a visitor; or

      (b) with valid leave granted for a period of 6 months or less,  unless
      that leave is as a

      fianc�(e) or proposed  civil  partner,  or  was  granted  pending  the
      outcome of family

      court or divorce proceedings

      E-LTRP.2.2. The applicant must not be in the UK -

      (a) on temporary admission  or  temporary  release,  unless  paragraph
      EX.1. applies; or

      (b)  in  breach  of  immigration  laws  (disregarding  any  period  of
      overstaying for a period of 28 days

      or less), unless paragraph EX.1. applies.

   8.   Paragraph 6  of  HC  395  (as  amended)  interprets  'in  breach  of
      immigration laws' as meaning 'without valid leave where such leave  is
      required, or in breach of the conditions of leave.' It does not appear
      that the appellant falls within that provision given that she  arrived
      as an asylum seeker and  claimed  asylum  on  the  day  following  her
      arrival. Since that time, she has either been in  the  United  Kingdom
      pursuing her claim or an appeal  against  the  refusal  to  grant  her
      international protection. However, the  appellant  must  also  satisfy
      Appendix FM as regards her suitability for leave to remain (Section S-
      LTR). Subsection 1.6 provides that, if the presence of  the  appellant
      in the UK is not conducive to the public good because of her  conduct,
      character,  associations  or  other  reasons  it   shall   be   deemed
      undesirable to allow the appellant to remain. Mr Howells, who appeared
      for the Secretary of State, submitted that the appellant's arrival  in
      the United Kingdom clandestinely would lead  to  her  exclusion  under
      that provision. I agree. The appellant has been shown by  the  failure
      of her appeal in the First-tier Tribunal  to  have  invented  a  claim
      under Article 3 ECHR.  She  entered  the  United  Kingdom,  therefore,
      without bringing her entry to the attention of the authorities so that
      she might reside here with the husband. I find that it is  clear  that
      she has thereby sought to improve  the  prospects  of  her  claim  and
      appeal brought on Article 8 grounds as a consequence  of  living  here
      with the sponsor rather than in Iraq.  She  did  so  because  she  had
      failed in her  legitimate  attempt  to  obtain  entry  clearance  from
      abroad. I find that appellant immigration history  is  such  that  she
      does  fall  be  refused  on  grounds   of   suitability   within   the
      comprehensive provisions relating to 'conduct' under S-lTR 1.6.

   9.   As a consequence of that finding, the appellant has to  satisfy  the
      provisions of EX1 and 2:

      EX.1. This paragraph applies if

      (a)

      (i) ...

      ...

      or

      (b) the applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
      partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled in  the  UK
      or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and  there
      are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  with  that   partner
      continuing outside the UK.

      EX.2.  For  the  purposes  of   paragraph   EX.1.(b)   "insurmountable
      obstacles" means the very  significant  difficulties  which  would  be
      faced by the applicant or their partner  in  continuing  their  family
      life together outside the UK and which could not be overcome or  would
      entail very serious hardship for the applicant or their partner.




  10. Mr Joseph acknowledged that the decision of the Upper Tribunal in  AAH
      (Iraqi Kurds - internal relocation) Iraq CG UKUT 00212 (IAC) indicates
      that cultural norms within the IKR  would  mean  that  family  support
      would be forthcoming if the appellant and sponsor had to move back  to
      Erbil. That would  be  the  case  notwithstanding  the  appellant  and
      sponsor's evidence that their family  members  would  be  unlikely  to
      assist. Mr Howells submitted that the sponsor has modest savings which
      would enable him to set up business in Iraq and that the  sponsor  had
      shown  considerable  entrepreneurial   flair   in   establishing   and
      maintaining a successful business in Cardiff. I agree. I have no doubt
      that the appellant and sponsor would wish to remain in Cardiff and  to
      continue to build their business here. I am aware also that the couple
      are seeking treatment here  for  infertility.  However,  there  is  no
      obvious impediment to their return to the IKR;  the  sponsor  did  not
      argue that he had any reason to fear returning to that  region  whilst
      the appellant's claim that her family in the IKR might  seek  to  harm
      her has been rejected by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  Mere  preference
      coupled  with  inconvenience  cannot  bring  the  couple  within   the
      requirements for there to exist  insurmountable  obstacles  presenting
      very significant difficulties preventing them continuing their  family
      life together in Iraq. There is simply no evidence to show that  their
      return to Iraq would cause this couple very serious  or,  indeed,  any
      significant hardship.

  11. Having regard to all the evidence and my findings  set  out  above,  I
      find that the appellant is unable to satisfy the requirements of  EX1.
      Moreover, I cannot identify any compelling circumstances in this  case
      which fall outside the provisions of Appendix FM. I find that this  is
      a case where the failure of the appellant to meet the requirements  of
      the  Immigration  Rules  must  mean,  absent  any   other   compelling
      circumstances, that her appeal  on  human  rights  grounds  should  be
      dismissed.

          Notice of Decision

    The appellant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary  of  State
    dated 31 August      2018 is dismissed.
