Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Ezeoke, Natado Solicitors, London
For the Respondent:    Miss Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria  born  on  14  April  1989.   She
    appealed against the respondent's decision dated 30 July 2015  refusing
    her application for leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  on  human
    rights grounds.  Her appeal  was  heard  by  Judge  of  the  First-Tier
    Tribunal Traynor on 4 October 2016.  The appeal was dismissed under the
    Immigration Rules and under Article 8 of ECHR in a decision promulgated
    on 14 November 2016.

 2. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and  permission  was
    refused by the First-Tier Tribunal.  An application for  permission  to
    appeal was lodged with the Upper Tribunal and permission was granted by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce on 8 September 2017.  The permission  states
    that a material part of the Tribunal's reasoning was its  finding  that
    the appellant is likely to still have a paternal grandmother living  in
    Nigeria.  It states that it is arguable that making  that  finding  the
    Tribunal failed to take  into  account  a  material  fact,  namely  the
    significant passage of time.

 3. A Rule 24 response was lodged which states that the  decision  is  well
    reasoned, all the evidence was considered by the Judge and he has given
    adequate reasons for his findings.  It states that the grounds are just
    a disagreement with his findings.  The response goes on to  state  that
    the appellant cannot succeed under the Rules as she came to the  United
    Kingdom 13 years ago  and  not  20  years  ago.   It  states  that  the
    appellant is intelligent and with the assistance of her relatives,  who
    still live in Nigeria, there is no reason why she cannot get a job  and
    look  after  herself  and  her  child.   Her  mother  and  brother  can
    financially assist her from the United Kingdom until  she  can  support
    herself, and the Home Office will assist by providing her with  ï¿½1,500.
    The response states that neither the  appellant  nor  her  mother  were
    found to be reliable witnesses.

The Hearing

 4. The  appellant's  representative  made  his  submissions  referring  to
    paragraph 71 of the decision in which  the  Judge  states  that  he  is
    treating with caution  the  appellant's  claim  to  have  no  relatives
    remaining in Nigeria.  I was then  referred  to  paragraph  56  of  the
    decision in which it is stated that the appellant lived with her father
    and step-mother and her siblings in Nigeria, along  with  her  paternal
    grandmother.   At  paragraph  57  it  is  stated  that   her   paternal
    grandmother is now deceased.  She died after the appellant came to  the
    United Kingdom in 2002.  The representative submitted that even if  the
    Judge had found that her grandmother was still alive she would  now  be
    too old to support the appellant if she returned to Nigeria.   All  her
    siblings are now in the United Kingdom.

 5. He referred to Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration
    Act 2009 and the best interests of the child.  The Judge  has  referred
    to there being education available in Nigeria but he submitted that the
    Judge did not consider the appellant's risk on return and the fact that
    she would have no accommodation there.  He submitted that the Judge did
    not consider that  the  appellant  and  her  child  are  likely  to  be
    destitute if they go back to Nigeria.

 6. The representative then went on to deal with paragraph 276ADE.  This is
    not referred to in the grounds  but  he  submitted  that  it  would  be
    difficult for this appellant to integrate on return to Nigeria  as  she
    is returning with a child and has not been there since she was 15 years
    old.  He submitted that the Judge has not taken into account  the  fact
    that on return she  will  have  to  relocate  with  a  child  (now  two
    children).  He submitted that this  issue  is  obvious  and  should  be
    considered.  I was referred to  paragraph  79  of  the  decision  which
    refers to Sections 117A and B of the 2002 Act and public interest.   He
    submitted that when the appellant came to the United  Kingdom  she  was
    only 15 years old and she has always considered herself to  be  British
    as she had no  knowledge  of  the  immigration  system  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  He submitted that her age on arrival has  to  be  taken  into
    account and when the Judge refers to her precarious status he  has  not
    properly considered the fact that the appellant was very young when she
    arrived.

 7. The Presenting Officer made her submissions referring to the  grant  of
    permission.  She submitted that the grant of permission is based on the
    appellant probably  having  a  paternal  grandmother  still  living  in
    Nigeria and she submitted that at no time did the Judge find this.   At
    paragraph 71 the Judge refers to "no relatives remaining  in  Nigeria".
    The Judge refers to the appellant's mother, who was a witness  at  that
    hearing. Her mother told the Tribunal that when the appellant  was  not
    at school she lived with her  paternal  grandmother.   The  Judge  then
    states that the paternal grandmother is now  deceased.   The  appellant
    was told this by an unidentified acquaintance from Nigeria, who she met
    by chance in Woolwich in 2010.  She submitted that  the  representative
    states that the inconsistency referred to by the Judge at paragraph  72
    is an error of law but it does not go to the core of  the  claim.   The
    Judge found the appellant's evidence and her mother's  evidence  to  be
    unreliable.  She submitted that the Judge does  not  believe  that  the
    appellant has no relatives remaining in Nigeria.  The  evidence  before
    the Judge was not consistent.  There were  credibility  issues  in  the
    appellant's claim.

 8. The grounds of application state that the Judge  did  not  give  proper
    regard to Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
    2009 but she submitted that he did.  At paragraph 64 the  Judge  refers
    to the best interests of the child being a primary  consideration.  The
    Judge considers the age of the child and at paragraph 68 refers to  the
    child being dependent on her mother.  At paragraph 74 the Judge  states
    that the child can have a private life in  Nigeria  and  she  is  young
    enough to adapt to that.  At paragraph 81 the child is  again  referred
    to and the Presenting Officer submitted that this is  a  very  thorough
    decision, has been written extremely carefully and all the  aspects  of
    this claim have been properly considered by the Judge.

 9. The Presenting Officer submitted that the appellant has said  that  the
    child cannot go to Nigeria as it would  not  be  safe  there,  but  she
    submitted that it is clear that this child has no basis of stay in  the
    United Kingdom and neither does  her  mother.   The  grounds  refer  to
    significant obstacles to the appellant and  her  child  integrating  in
    Nigeria but she submitted that the appellant is 27 years old  and  does
    not require other people to depend on.  She is well  educated  and  she
    may well have relatives in Nigeria.  She lived there until she  was  15
    years old.  She started her education there and at paragraph 41 of  the
    decision the Judge finds that the appellant can get work in Nigeria and
    there is free education for her son.  The  appellant  has  stated  that
    there are no health issues affecting either her or her son.

10. I was referred to paragraph 78 of the decision which starts "Even if  I
    am wrong in the above respect (being the appellant's  family  life  for
    the purposes of Article 8 and the fact that she lives with her  mother)
    whatever support she is receiving from her mother and perhaps her other
    siblings in the UK can be maintained upon her return to Nigeria."

11.  The  Presenting  Officer  submitted  that  the  Judge  has  considered
    everything in his decision.  It was open to him to make the findings he
    did and he has explained how he reached these findings.  She  submitted
    that the fact that the appellant and her mother were found  not  to  be
    credible must go against the claim and she submitted that the Judge has
    made it clear why he finds the appellant and her child  can  return  to
    Nigeria and there will be no breach of the Immigration Rules or Article
    8 of ECHR.

12. She submitted that there is no error of law in the Judge's decision.

13. The appellant's representative referred  me  to  paragraph  72  of  the
    decision and the inconsistency referred to therein.  This inconsistency
    relates to the different evidence given by the appellant and her mother
    about  where  the  appellant  lived  in  Nigeria  and  who  with.   The
    representative stated that this does not go the core of the  claim  and
    in any case if I considered paragraph 43 and paragraphs 56 to 58  there
    is no inconsistency.  He submitted that it is because the  Judge  found
    there to be an inconsistency that he believes that  the  appellant  may
    have relatives in Nigeria but he submitted that that is not  the  case,
    based on the appellant's and her mother's evidence.  He submitted  that
    if there is no inconsistency then the Judge's decision must be  flawed.



14. With regard to Section 55 and the paragraphs in which the Judge  refers
    to this, he submitted that the Judge has not considered that there will
    be no family apart from the appellant for the child when she returns to
    Nigeria.  I was referred to the appellant's statement in  the  original
    bundle and he submitted that the appellant will  be  returning  with  a
    child and without a job.  This is referred to at  paragraph  6  of  her
    statement and he submitted  again  that  the  Judge  has  not  properly
    considered what will happen to the appellant and her child if they have
    to go back to Nigeria to face the likelihood  of  destitution  and  the
    problems of integration.

15. I was asked to find that there  are  material  errors  of  law  in  the
    decision.

Decision and Reasons

16. The Presenting Officer is correct when she states that the Judge at  no
    time stated that the appellant likely had a paternal grandmother  still
    living in Nigeria.  Because the Judge found  the  appellant's  and  her
    mother's evidence to be unreliable, the Judge does not believe that the
    appellant has no relatives in Nigeria.  The Judge has  referred  to  an
    inconsistency in the evidence given by the appellant and  the  evidence
    given by her mother. This is a fact.  At paragraph 58 the  Judge  finds
    that the appellant has deliberately been prevaricating. He states  that
    although the appellant now states that her  paternal  grandmother  died
    after she came to the United Kingdom, at paragraph 43 the  Judge  notes
    that in her oral  evidence  the  appellant  states  that  her  paternal
    grandmother died before she came to the United Kingdom. The appellant's
    and her mother's evidence is contradictory and confusing.

17. At paragraph 72 the judge  refers  to  the  appellant's  representative
    suggesting that the inconsistency does not go to the core of the claim,
    but the Judge explains  that  on  a  fundamental  issue  such  as  what
    relatives the appellant may have in Nigeria. There  is  evidence  which
    contradicts the appellant's claim that there are no such relatives. The
    judge finds that on the balance of probabilities neither the  appellant
    nor her mother is a reliable witness. He has not received a  consistent
    account from them and because of this  is  not  prepared  to  give  the
    appellant the benefit of the doubt.

18. The Judge has clearly considered the appellant's position on return  to
    Nigeria finding that she was there until she was 15, and that she is an
    educated adult who will be able to find work on return.  The  appellant
    has stated that her son is too young to go to Nigeria with her  because
    she faces uncertainty but the Judge has considered Section 55  and  the
    best interests of the child, which are to be with his mother who has no
    right to be in the UK.  The appellant states that she will be unable to
    integrate in Nigeria but she was there for 15 years  and  much  of  her
    education took place there.

19. The Judge's decision is thorough and all the aspects of the claim  have
    been properly considered by him.  He does not find  the  appellant  and
    her mother to be reliable  witnesses  and  has  pointed  out  that  the
    appellant has been aware for a considerable time that she has no status
    in the United Kingdom and has done nothing  about  it.   Based  on  the
    submissions before me today I find there is no material error of law in
    the Judge's decision.

Notice of Decision
