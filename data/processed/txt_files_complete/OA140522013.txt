Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr. S. Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent:    Mr. A.  Slatter  of  Counsel  instructed  by  Maxwell
Alves.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Chamberlain promulgated on 8 May 2014, allowing Ms Su's appeal  against
    the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer ('ECO') dated 29  May  2013
    to refuse entry clearance as a partner.

 2. Although before me the ECO is the appellant and Ms Su  the  respondent,
    for the sake of consistency with the proceedings before the  First-tier
    Tribunal I shall hereafter refer to Ms Su as the Appellant and the  ECO
    as the Respondent.

Background

 3. The Appellant is a national of China born on 28  October  1967.  On  18
    February 2013 she completed an on-line application form  seeking  entry
    clearance to join her husband, Zhihua Wang (the sponsor), in the UK.

 4. The Appellant's application was refused for reasons set out in a Notice
    of Immigration Decision dated 29 May 2013 with particular reference  to
    paragraphs E-ECP.2.7 and 3.1 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 5. The Appellant appealed  to  the  IAC.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    allowed the Appellant's appeal under the Rules for reasons set  out  in
    his determination.

 6. The Respondent sought permission to appeal which was granted by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Holmes on 15 August 2014.

Consideration

 7. Although the Notice of  Immigration  Decision  raised  issues  both  in
    respect of the relationship requirements and the financial requirements
    of the Rules, the  Respondent  does  not  now  seek  to  challenge  the
    favourable finding of the First-tier Tribunal Judge in respect  of  the
    relationship requirements (see determination at paragraph 15).

 8. The issue raised by the Respondent in the grounds  in  support  of  the
    application  for  permission  to  appeal  relates  to   the   financial
    requirements of the Rules, and in  particular  the  specified  evidence
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal Judge sets out his analysis in respect  of  the
    sponsor's income at paragraphs 16-21 of his  determination.  The  Judge
    makes a number of relevant findings:

         (i) "[T]he sponsor has been working at the China Garden  restaurant
         from July 2010, and is still working there" (paragraph 16).


         (ii)  Although  there  had  been  a  change  of  ownership  of  the
         restaurant all business obligations had been transferred with  that
         ownership, and in particular there were no changes  in  respect  of
         the relationship between employer and employees (paragraphs 17-18).


         (iii) The sponsor had produced supporting evidence  in  respect  of
         his income - none of which had been disputed by the  Respondent  as
         being not genuine. The documents comprised: payslips showing  basic
         pay of  �450  gross  per  week;  a  confirmatory  letter  from  the
         employer's manager confirming that the Appellant was paid in  cash;
         P60s for the tax years ending 2011 to 2014 showing that the sponsor
         had been paying tax on his cash income. Although the sponsor's bank
         statements did not reflect his pay, the  Judge  commented  that  he
         "would not expect to see regular deposits" given that  the  sponsor
         was paid in cash.    (Paragraph 19.)


         (iv) "I find on the balance of  probabilities  that  the  [sponsor]
         does earn �450 gross per week working at the China Garden, and that
         he  did  so  for  the  relevant  six  month  period  prior  to  the
         application" (paragraph 19).


         (v) "I find that the sponsor earns over the minimum required by the
         immigration rules as he earns �23,400 per annum. I find that he has
         provided the necessary documentation to show this. I find  that  he
         is paid in cash, which explains why there are not regular  deposits
         into his bank account.... I find on the  balance  of  probabilities
         that  the  Appellant  meets  the  financial  requirements  of   the
         immigration rules" (paragraph 21).


10. The Judge also resolved  to  his  satisfaction  issues  over  different
    stylisations of the sponsor's name by reference to alternative uses  of
    a Cantonese and Mandarin pinyin  (paragraph  20).  Further,  the  Judge
    expressed satisfaction in respect of the accommodation available to the
    Appellant (paragraph 22).

11. The Respondent's challenge before the Upper Tribunal is essentially one
    of form rather than substance. There is no  express  challenge  to  the
    clear findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge - findings  which  were
    plainly open to him on the available evidence. Rather, the  grounds  of
    challenge are  rooted  in  the  'specified  evidence'  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE: in particular it is contended that the Appellant failed
    to demonstrate deposits into a bank account that matched the  sponsor's
    income from employment (paragraph 2(c) of  Appendix  FM-SE);  moreover,
    the Judge failed to have proper regard to the requirements of the Rules
    in this context.

12. In resisting the Respondent's challenge, Mr Slatter makes a  number  of
    attractive points:

   (i) Whilst acknowledging that issues  were  raised  in  respect  of  the
         financial requirements in the Notice of Immigration  Decision,  the
         Respondent did not  place  express  reliance  upon  the  evidential
         requirements of Appendix FM-SE so much as reach a conclusion as  to
         quantum. Nor was there any such focus  on  Appendix  FM-SE  at  the
         hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.


   (ii) In any event, the strictness of the  Rules  was  mitigated  by  the
         Respondent's   'Immigration   Directorate    Instructions'    which
         recognised that in circumstances where a sponsor was paid in  cash,
         bank statements might not exactly reflect income  from  employment.
         In such a  circumstance  income  from  employment  was  not  to  be
         completely disregarded, but rather an  applicant  could  rely  upon
         such income as was reflected in the bank statements. See April 2013
         IDIs, 'Family Members under Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules',
         at 3.1.15. A copy of the relevant IDIs has been placed on file; the
         pertinent passage is in  these  terms  "But,  where  that  person's
         specified bank statements only show a proportion of  that  post-tax
         income, only the amount shown on the bank statements can be counted
         towards the financial requirement".


   (iii) Although there was no exact correlation between weekly  wages  and
         the deposits in the sponsor's bank account, an analysis of the bank
         statements at pages 96-107 of the Appellant's  bundle  showed  that
         between 23 July 2012 and  21  January  2013  there  had  been  cash
         deposits of �18,826 which  was  in  excess  of  the  annual  income
         required under the Rules. Adopting the  approach  under  the  IDIs,
         this was adequate to satisfy the financial requirements.


13. Mr Slatter was frank in  acknowledging  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge had  not  expressly  directed  himself  to  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE, and had not undertaken the sort of analysis pursuant to
    the IDIs to which my attention was now drawn.

14. In light of the contents of the IDIs, the findings  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge, and the supporting evidence that had  been  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge, Mr Kandola  was  reticent  in  pressing  the
    Respondent's challenge: he did not expressly  withdraw  the  challenge,
    but stated that he would do little more than rely on the grounds.

15. In all of the circumstances I am  not  minded  to  interfere  with  the
    conclusion of the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the  Appellant's  appeal
    should be allowed under the Rules. I acknowledge that the Judge was  in
    error not to have express regard  to  the  evidential  requirements  of
    Appendix  FM-SE.  However,  in  circumstances  where  the  Respondent's
    challenge is essentially one of form rather than substance,  and  where
    the findings as to the sponsor's income were so clear, and yet  further
    where the supporting  evidence  met  the  requirements  of  immigration
    control imposed by a combination of  the  Rules  and  the  Respondent's
    policy under those Rules as represented by the IDIs, it would be unjust
    now to interfere with what was essentially the  right  outcome  to  the
    appeal.

16. In the circumstances  I  find  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge was not flawed for any material error  of  law,  and  so
    stands.

Notice of Decision

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  contained  no  material
    error of law and stands.

18. The ECO's appeal is dismissed.
