                           (ANONIMITY ORDER MADE)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

In a "Decision on  Error  of  Law  and  Further  Directions"  issued  on  19
November 2021 Upper Tribunal Judge Macleman determined that  the  First-tier
Tribunal had erred in law and set aside its decision.

He also gave Directions inviting representation on the  proper  disposal  of
the appeal.

No such representations have been received from the Respondent.

The appellant has asked for the appeal to be determined again in the  First-
tier Tribunal.

Given that the basis for  setting  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal was that the First-tier Tribunal  had  determined  unlawfully  that
the appellant was not entitled to apply for asylum and  had  not  determined
the merits, if any, in his claim I see merit in remittal in  order  to  keep
open the appellant's  rights  of  appeal.  There  has  been  no  substantial
consideration of the disputed facts in this appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision having been set aside, I allow the appeal and direct  that  the
appeal be determined again in the First-tier Tribunal.
