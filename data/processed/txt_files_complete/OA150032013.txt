Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Hussain
For the Respondent:    Mr Whitwell (HOPO)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This was an appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Hussain, promulgated on 27th August 2014, following a hearing  at
    Richmond on 10th July 2014.  In the determination,  the  judge  allowed
    the appeal of  Mrs  Jannathul  Ferdous.   The  Respondent  subsequently
    applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was born on 1st July 1990.
     She appeals against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent  refusing  her
    application to join her husband, Mr Johir Hussain, a person present and
    settled in the United Kingdom, in a  decision  dated  17th  June  2013.
    What is in issue here is whether the Sponsor had an income  of  ï¿½18,600
    per annum.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge explained that  the  only  issue  before  the  Tribunal  "was
    whether the evidence relating to the Sponsor's employment with  Primark
    and Ruchi Takeaway could be relied upon"  (paragraph  8)  in  terms  of
    demonstrating that the Appellant could  satisfy  the  financial  income
    threshold requirement.

 4. The argument on behalf of the Respondent was that the earnings  of  the
    Appellant were not reflected in the  bank  statement.   They  were  not
    precisely reflected in terms of what the Appellant claimed to have been
    earning.  The judge took the view that, "it was for the  Respondent  to
    demonstrate that the Immigration Rules in force  at  the  date  of  the
    decision require the Appellant to show that the deposits going into the
    Sponsor's bank account corresponded with the payslips"  (paragraph  9),
    and the Respondent was unable to do so.

 5. So, the judge took the view that, "the only issue remaining was whether
    the Sponsor was able to produce evidence of his employment by reference
    to letters from his employer as  required  by  the  Immigration  Rules"
    (paragraph 11) and on this the judge was satisfied that  the  Appellant
    could indeed do so (see paragraph 12).  The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 6. The  grounds  of  application  state  that  the  judge  had  materially
    misdirected himself in coming  to  the  conclusion  that  there  is  no
    requirement in law for the Respondent to demonstrate  that  the  salary
    outlined in the Sponsor's payslips is  precisely  corroborated  by  the
    bank statements provided (see paragraph 10).  This  is  because  it  is
    reasonable, on a fair reading of Appendix FM-SE, to consider  that  the
    point of the bank statements is to substantiate  the  salary  that  the
    Appellant is relying upon.  This he could not do.

 7. On 30th September  2014,  permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  the
    Tribunal.

Submissions

 8. At the hearing before me on 24th November 2014 there was  a  change  of
    legal representatives from Jalalabad Law Associates  to  Liberty  Legal
    Solicitors.   Mr  Hussain,  appearing  on  behalf  of  the   Appellant,
    submitted that he would rely upon a fresh bundle, which was  paginated,
    and which carried with it an application under Rule 15(2A) to admit new
    evidence, although other evidence, in the form of the  Sponsor's  P60s,
    was the same as what had been before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  Mr
    Whitwell, appearing on behalf of the Respondent, objected that I should
    not admit any new evidence now, without an explanation  as  to  why  it
    could not have been admitted earlier, given that this was an  error  of
    law hearing to begin with.  I agreed with Mr Whitwell.  Subject to this
    the parties made their submissions before me.

 9. In his submissions, Mr Hussain stated that the judge was aware that the
    Sponsor was himself making cash deposits into  his  account.   In  this
    event, they were bound not to be exactly the same amounts that  he  was
    claiming to earn.  This is because paragraph A1(1)(n) of Appendix FM-SE
    is clear that,

         "The gross amount of any cash  income  may  be  counted  where  the
         person's specified  bank  statements  show  the  net  amount  which
         relates to the gross amount shown on  their  payslips  (or  in  the
         relevant space for evidence provided in addition to  the  specified
         bank statements in relation to non-employment income).   Otherwise,
         only the net amount shown on the specified bank statements  may  be
         counted."

10. This was a case where the Sponsor had two jobs and it was accepted that
    he had two jobs.  He had been employed with Primark since June 2012 and
    with Ruchi Indian Takeaway since September 2012.   He  was  being  paid
    cash in hand.  He had submitted his P60 before the judge.  There was an
    employer's letter.  There was HMRC confirmation of his employment.   It
    was unnecessary for the judge to read anything more than was  literally
    required into the Immigration Rules.

11. For his part, Mr Whitwell submitted that he would rely upon the Grounds
    of Appeal and that Appendix FM-SE should be interpreted  in  the  sense
    that the bank statements  are  intended  to  reflect  the  earnings  as
    claimed.  This was not the case here.  They did not tally with the wage
    slips.

No Error of Law

12. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA [2007]) such that I should set aside the decision and re-make  the
    decision.  The decision by the judge is careful, comprehensive and well-
    crafted.  The essential point of appeal by the Respondent is  that  the
    bank statements did not reflect what was claimed as earned  wages.   As
    the judge makes clear the Respondent had accepted that the Sponsor  was
    making cash deposits into his account (see paragraph 4).

13. The nub of the judge's conclusions are at paragraph 9  where  he  notes
    that the guidance relied upon by the Respondent was not in place at the
    date of the Respondent's decision.   More  importantly  the  Respondent
    could not demonstrate that there was a Rule-based requirement  for  the
    proposition that the wages earned have to  be  reflected  in  the  bank
    statement.

14. This is not likely to happen, on any commonsense view, where the  wages
    are not going directly and automatically into a bank account.  If  they
    are paid cash  in  hand  employers  will  sometimes  put  in  more  and
    sometimes put in less.

15. The important fact is that the judge explored this issue thoroughly (at
    paragraph 10), and concluded that,

         "A letter was produced from  Primark  dated  7th  July  2013  which
         confirmed the Sponsor commenced his employment on  22nd  July  2012
         and there was a further letter from Ruchi Takeaway dated  2nd  July
         2013 which  confirmed  that  the  Sponsor  was  employed  from  1st
         September 2012" (paragraph 12).

16. The judge gave an opportunity to the Respondent  to  have  the  hearing
    adjourned so as to be able to consider this latest evidence and  to  go
    into "the reliability of the letters"  and  that  opportunity  was  not
    taken up.  The submission of late  documents  was  not,  as  the  judge
    concluded on the evidence before him, the fault of the  Appellant,  but
    the fault of others (paragraph 14).

17. In these circumstances, the judge allowed the appeal.   The  conclusion
    must be right in law.  If it were otherwise, it  would  be  open  to  a
    party, (such as the Respondent in this case), to  read  more  into  the
    Rules than was actually specified.

18. Given that the purpose and the thrust  of  the  current  system  is  to
    remove discretion and to set out matters in full clarity for all to see
    and to adhere by, such a proposition cannot be right in law.  The Rules
    are what they are.  The judge read  them.   He  invited  commentary  on
    them.  He applied them.  His findings were open to him.

Decision

19. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

20. No anonymity order is made.
