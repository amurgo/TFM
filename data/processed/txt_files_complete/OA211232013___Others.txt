                     Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Pickup
                                   Between

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                        [No anonymity direction made]

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                            Fatima Usman Gulumbe
                                Naseeb Aminu
                                 Samir Aminu

                                                                   Claimants

Representation:

For the claimants:     Not represented
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, Fatima Usman Gulumbe, date of birth  25.7.83,  and  her
    children, Naseeb Aminu, date of birth 25.10.09, and Samir  Aminu,  date
    of birth 11.12.07, are citizens of Nigeria.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Flower promulgated 23.6.14,  allowing  the
    appeals of the claimants against the  decisions  of  the  Secretary  of
    State to refuse their applications for entry clearance  to  the  United
    Kingdom as the partner and children of the  sponsor  Mr  Aminu  Argungu
    Umar.  The Judge dealt with the appeal on the papers on 6.6.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Molloy  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    7.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 31.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.



Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Flower should be set aside.

 6. There was no jurisdiction for the judge to  hear  the  appeals  of  the
    claimants. That is because by the  date  of  the  appeal  hearing,  the
    Secretary of  State  had  withdrawn  the  decisions  and  issued  entry
    clearance on 17.2.14.

 7. It follows that there was no extant immigration  decision  against  the
    claimants and thus  there  could  be  no  appeal  against  a  withdrawn
    decision.



Decision:

 8. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remake the decision by directing that  the  appeal  of
                    each claimant be treated as withdrawn.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: There was no valid appeal in this case.
