For the Appellants:    Mr J Bryce, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co.,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The first appellant is a citizen of Nepal, born on 14th June 1981.  She
    came to the UK as a student in  2009.   On  8th  May  2014  she  sought
    further leave to remain as  a  Tier  2  (General)  Migrant,  which  was
    refused on  17th  August  2015  for  use  of  a  false  certificate  of
    sponsorship.

 2. The second appellant is her husband, a citizen of Nepal  born  on  19th
    May 1973, and the third is their son, a citizen of Nepal born  on  14th
    January 2005.  Their applications depended on the first appellant,  and
    were also refused.

 3. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.   Judge  Fox  heard
    their case on 21st January 2016.  It was conceded that they  could  not
    meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  Their case was  argued
    on  the  basis  of  Article  8  ECHR,   outwith   the   Rules.    Their
    representative also sought a "declaration" that the appellants were not
    party to the fraud.

 4. At paragraph 14 of his determination, promulgated on 3  February  2016,
    the judge said that the first and second appellants had  at  best  been
    "extremely na�ve in trusting the services" of  the  agency  which  they
    employed, had not acted diligently when they first  became  aware  that
    things were amiss, and had not acted promptly in trying  to  secure  an
    alternative certificate of sponsorship.  However, the  judge  "afforded
    them the benefit of the doubt" and so was satisfied that they were  the
    victims rather than perpetrators of the fraud,  and  that  the  invalid
    certificate had been produced innocently.

 5. The judge went on to dismiss the appeals.

 6. The appellants sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   The
    grounds include the following points.  At paragraph 15 the judge stated
    a test of "at least an arguable case" to justify  looking  outside  the
    Rules, which was contrary to authority.   At  paragraph  16  the  judge
    referred to "the legitimate  aim  of  the  maintenance  of  immigration
    control ... an accepted element required for the prevention of disorder
    or crime".  The appellants had no criminal  record  and  there  was  no
    suggestion that their removal was directed to prevention of disorder or
    crime.  Only the economic interests in the UK were relevant.  They  had
    presented a case that their  removal  would  not  be  in  the  economic
    interests of the UK.  At paragraph 19 the judge  said  that  all  three
    appellants "were born and enjoyed  their  formative  years  in  Nepal".
    However, the first appellant was born in India and moved to Nepal  only
    on her marriage in 2003, and the third appellant left Nepal at the  age
    of 4 and not returned since.  The judge's error as to where  the  third
    appellant spent his formative years led to error in assessment  of  the
    child's best interests.  At paragraph 21 the  judge  appeared  to  find
    that the recent natural disaster in Nepal  weighed  in  favour  of  the
    return of the appellants, whereas it was an indication  that  the  best
    interests of the child were likely to be undermined by return.

 7. In his submissions Mr Bryce adopted all the  grounds,  but  focused  on
    error of fact in the finding that all three  appellants  enjoyed  their
    formative years in Nepal.  He said this amounted to  an  error  of  law
    material enough to justify remaking the decision, because it failed  to
    acknowledge the significance of the child's long residence  in  the  UK
    during his formative years, although at the date of the hearing in  the
    UT still six weeks short of being a "qualifying child" for the purposes
    of section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act.

 8. Mr Bryce said that in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705  the  Court  of
    Appeal held, although reluctantly, that public interest  considerations
    fell to be considered under that sub-section, but he submitted that was
    on the basis of  prior  Court  of  Appeal  authority,  not  binding  in
    Scotland, and it was  foreseeable  that  the  Court  of  Session  might
    endorse a contrary analysis. He accepted that in this case, on  current
    circumstances, it  was  incontrovertible  that  wider  public  interest
    considerations did fall to be considered.

 9. Mr Bryce  pointed  to  three  considerations  to  justify  a  different
    outcome.  The judge at  paragraph  17  took  it  as  adverse  that  the
    appellant's residence, although always lawful, comprised  a  series  of
    finite periods of leave, but that could not be relevant to the  child's
    long residence, on the principle that the conduct of  the  parents  did
    not weigh against the child.  That matter could not be relevant to  the
    child's integration at school and  in  its  community.   Secondly,  the
    parents were in the position in which they found themselves not because
    of any wrongdoing, but because a crime had been committed against them.
     Even the finding that they had been "extremely na�ve" was unfair.  The
    committing of a fraud could be said to result "at least in  part  as  a
    result of regulatory failure and part of the state.  That consideration
    must, viewed fairly, somewhat mitigate whatever public  interest  there
    may be  in  removal".   Thirdly,  the  parents  satisfied  the  English
    language and financial independence tests in section 117B(2)  and  (3).
    The appellants appeared to have paid their fraudulent agents �7,500  in
    total, and so had been seriously  cheated.   The  first  appellant  had
    completed a degree at Napier University.

10. Mr Bryce acknowledged that there is  now  authority  that  sub-sections
    117B(2) and (3) are at best neutral, not positively in favour of  leave
    being granted outside the Rules.  He asked me to note the letter  which
    was before the First-tier Tribunal, dated 7th January  2016,  from  the
    charitable organisation specialising in mental health and wellbeing  of
    minority women for  which  the  appellant  worked  as  a  volunteer  in
    administration/language support worker from 16th September 2013 to 13th
    July 2014 as a volunteer and subsequently as a paid employee until  the
    date of  the  letter.   She  provided  language  support  in  community
    languages such  as  Finti  and  Urdu  and  was  an  "indispensable  and
    invaluable asset ... it would be very difficult to replace her ...".

11. Mr Matthews said on  the  question  of  whether  there  had  to  be  an
    "arguable case" that it was immaterial whether the judge perceived  the
    issue to involve one or two stages, as he had gone  on  to  devote  the
    substance of his decision to considering Article 8 outwith  the  Rules.
    There was no error in how the judge referred to  the  public  interest.
    It is enshrined in case law and now in statute that there is  a  public
    interest in the enforcement of the Immigration Rules.

12. Turning to the main thrust of Mr Bryce's submissions, Mr Matthews  said
    that the seven year point is set out both in the Rules and in  statute.
    He  accepted  that  there  would   be   cases   where   it   would   be
    disproportionate to expect departure from  the  country,  even  if  the
    child had been here for less than seven years.   At  the  time  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal hearing, the child had been here for just over  six
    years.  So far as any authority was relevant, MA is the only  presently
    relevant decision of a higher court either in England  or  in  Scotland
    and so should be followed.  The seven year threshold fixed in the Rules
    and in the Act was not an  absolute  dividing  line,  but  it  was  not
    lightly to be ignored, even in a case drawing near to  the  seven  year
    point.  Although the judge referred  to  all  three  appellants  having
    spent their formative years in Nepal, that was no  more  than  a  brief
    error  of  expression.   As  to  the  first  appellant  it  was  of  no
    significance at all.  As to  the  third  it  did  not  reflect  in  the
    decision as a whole, where the judge clearly had it before him that the
    third appellant had spent in the UK that period of his life  which  was
    the main focus of the case.  This was not a slip which had any  bearing
    on the outcome.  The three considerations urged for the appellants were
    (as Mr Bryce acknowledged) relevant only if the stage of  remaking  the
    decision were to  be  reached.   Even  if  it  was,  and  even  if  the
    appellants had been  duped,  the  case  was  one  which  might  attract
    sympathy, but that had little bearing on  the  proportionality  of  the
    outcome.  There was nothing to establish that any  of  the  appellants,
    taking into account the best interests of the child,  had  a  right  to
    remain in the UK outwith the requirements of the  Rules.   The  present
    occupation  of  the   first   appellant   was   creditable,   but   not
    indispensable, and she would leave that job if she had the chance to do
    so.  There was nothing erroneous in the Tribunal's observation that the
    appellants had been "extremely na�ve".  Finally,  there  was  no  error
    such as to require the decision to be set aside, but on  any  remaking,
    the same outcome should be reached.

13. Mr Bryce in response submitted that the appellants had made their  case
    on the basis of the child being here during his  formative  years,  and
    that fact had not been engaged with at all in  the  judge's  reasoning.
    Paragraph 19 was not a slip but an indication  of  a  failure  to  have
    regard to a central consideration.

14. I reserved my decision.

15. I do not find that the judge made any error  which  would  justify  the
    setting aside of the determination.

16. Paragraph 19 contains no more than a slip made in passing.  Reading the
    determination fairly and as a whole, the judge did not misapprehend the
    point that the  child  has  spent  the  significantly  formative  years
    between the ages of 4 and 10 in the UK.  It is to the forefront.

17. The judge at paragraph 20 found that  difficulties  for  the  child  on
    return would not be profound or unmanageable, that he would be able  to
    accommodate new experiences, that he would have the benefit of  support
    of family and former friends and neighbours, and that he was not  alien
    to  Nepalese  culture.   There  might  be   difficulty,   but   nothing
    insurmountable.  At paragraph 28 he found that private and family  life
    would be  interfered  with,  but  in  a  proportionate  manner.   Those
    conclusions were open to the judge, and  the  explanation  given  is  a
    legally adequate one, which leaves no relevant factor out of account.

18. The point about  natural  disaster  in  Nepal  does  not  quite  fairly
    represent the judge's decision.  It is followed  by  his  comment  that
    there would be no shortage of work and that the (first) appellant would
    have considerable experience and advantages to  offer  any  prospective
    employer.  There was no case before the judge by which  he  might  have
    found that the general situation in Nepal weighed significantly against
    the return of the third appellant, with the  family  support  he  would
    have.

19. The best has been made of the case for the appellants both in the First-
    tier Tribunal and  in  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  it  is  one  with  a
    sympathetic aspect.  However, the grounds are in substance no more than
    disagreement with a proportionality assessment which was  firmly  based
    on the facts.  I find no error such as to justify any interference with
    the judge's decision.  It shall stand.

20. Anonymity has not been sought.
