Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr F Farhat of Gulbenkian Andonian Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision issued on 27 June 2018 of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Talbot which refused the human rights appeal of  Mr
    and Mrs Khan.

 2. At the beginning of the hearing Mr Farhat renewed  an  application  for
    the appeal to be adjourned pending the outcome of a  challenge  in  the
    Court of Appeal to the respondent's approach to paragraph 322(5) of the
    Immigration Rules.  Mr Farhat maintained that  the  case  had  recently
    been heard over a number of days in the Court  of  Appeal  and  that  a
    decision was expected within approximately two  to  three  months.   We
    concluded that the correct approach was to apply the law as it  stands,
    avoiding delay. We were also not  provided  with  any  details  of  the
    matter in the Court of Appeal in order to be able to asses  if  it  was
    relevant to this case. We concluded that it was  in  the  interests  of
    justice to proceed and refused the adjournment request.

 3. Mr Khan is a national of Pakistan, born on 25  July  1982.  The  second
    appellant is his wife, also a national of Pakistan, born on 30 December
    1980.  In all material regards in this  matter,  Mrs  Khan's  claim  is
    dependent on that of her husband. For the purposes  of  this  decision,
    therefore, we refer only to Mr Khan as the appellant and to  the  facts
    of his claim.

 4. The background is that Mr Khan came to the UK on 22 February 2007  with
    entry clearance as a student which was valid until 24  June  2008.   He
    obtained further grant of leave as a student until 30  June  2009.   He
    then applied for leave as  a  Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)  Migrant  and
    obtained leave until 22 April 2011. On 26 March  2011  he  applied  for
    further leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant and  was  granted
    leave until 11 May 2013.  On 30 April 2013 he applied for further leave
    to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant and was granted leave until  12
    June 2016.

 5. On 6 June 2016 Mr Khan applied for indefinite leave to remain (IILR) as
    a Tier 1 (General) Migrant, varying that application to one for ILR  on
    the basis of long residence on 7 February 2017.

 6. The respondent refused the application for ILR in a decision  dated  26
    June 2017.  The respondent applied paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration
    Rules which states that an application may be refused on the basis of:

         "(5) The undesirability  of  permitting  the  person  concerned  to
             remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  light  of  his   conduct
             (including convictions which  do  not  fall  within  paragraph
             322(1C),  character  or  associations  or  the  fact  that  he
             represents a threat to national security;"

 7. The respondent's specific reasons for applying paragraph 322(5) were as
    follows:

         "On a previous application you submitted on 26 March 2011 for leave
         to remain as a Tier 1 migrant you claimed self-employed net  profit
         of �33,102  between  30  July  2010  and  10  March  2011,  however
         information provided by Her Majesty's Revenue  and  Customs  (HMRC)
         confirms you declared net profit of  �9,320  for  the  2010/11  tax
         year.

         From the information provided by HMRC above and Home Office records
         we have confirmed that there was a discrepancy of  �23,782  between
         what you declared in net profit to the Home  Office  and  what  you
         declared to HMRC for the 2010/11 tax year.  When  questioned  about
         the discrepancy you claimed that your  previous  accountants,  Agha
         Associates, made an error on your tax return and you were not aware
         that there  was  an  issue  until  your  new  accountant,  Kingsway
         Accountants reviewed all your tax affairs before you  submitted  an
         application for indefinite leave to remain in 2016.

         You stated that you provided your accountant with invoices and bank
         statements from them  to  prepare  your  tax  return.   It  is  not
         considered credible that a registered  accountant  would  submit  a
         self-assessment  tax  return  for  the  period  2010/11  tax   year
         declaring net profits through self-employment when they had all the
         relevant information  which  are  significantly  lower  than  those
         claimed on your Tier 1 application of 10 March 2011.  It  was  your
         responsibility to ensure that your tax return was submitted on time
         with the correct  information  and  by  failing  to  do  so  it  is
         considered that you  have  been  deceitful  or  dishonest  in  your
         dealings with HMRC.

         You claim that you retrospectively filed an amended tax return  for
         the  2010/11  tax  year  in  2016  and  have  now  fully  paid  any
         outstanding tax.  However you did not provide any evidence of  this
         and the information disclosed by HMRC to us on 28 April 2017  shows
         no record of any amended  tax  returns.   It  is  noted  that  HMRC
         records can take some time to update and it is  accepted  that  you
         may have submitted an amended tax  return  for  2010/11.   However,
         whether you submitted an amended tax return or not  would  have  no
         impact on the outcome of this application.  It is the Secretary  of
         State's view that you only sought to rectify your tax  returns  for
         2010/11 in the knowledge that you will be  called  to  account  for
         your previous returns when applying for your  indefinite  leave  to
         remain application.

         It is acknowledged that paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules
         is not a mandatory refusal, however the evidence submitted does not
         satisfactorily demonstrate that the failure to declare to  HMRC  at
         the time  any  of  the  self-employed  earnings  declared  on  your
         previous application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a
         Tier 1 (General) Migrant was a genuine error.   It  is  noted  that
         there would have been a clear benefit to yourself either by failing
         to declare your full earning to HMRC with respect to reducing  your
         tax liability or by falsely representing your earnings to UK  Visas
         and Immigration to enable you to meet the points required to obtain
         leave in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant."

 8. The appellant appealed against the respondent's decision to the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  In the grounds of appeal, he maintained his  submission
    that he was unaware of an error  made  by  previous  accountants,  Agha
    Associates.  He maintained that he had retrospectively  paid  his  full
    tax  liability  to  HMRC  prior  to  the  respondent's  decision.   The
    appellant had chosen to flag up the discrepancy in his application  and
    the questionnaire provided to him on 7 February 2017  as  part  of  his
    application for indefinite leave to remain.  He  also  maintained  that
    the respondent had  not  met  the  initial  burden  of  proof  for  the
    allegation of undesirable character or conduct.

 9. The appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Talbot on 8 June 2018.
      In  his  decision  dated  27  June  2018  the  judge  summarised  the
    respondent's decision in some detail in paragraph 5.   The  appellant's
    oral evidence was recorded in paragraphs 7 to 13.  In paragraph 11  the
    judge records the appellant's oral evidence as follows:

         "In 2016 the  appellant  went  to  a  firm  of  consultants  called
         Kingsway to deal with  his  affairs  in  connection  with  his  ILR
         application.  They asked him for details of his  business  accounts
         for the previous six years.  The Appellant provided  Kingsway  with
         evidence such as old invoices, showing that he had  earned  in  the
         region of �41,000 for the tax  year  2010-11  (�33,000  from  self-
         employment and �8,000 from employment) and they  queried  with  him
         why he had only had a tax liability of �2,636 for that year (on the
         basis of self-employed income of only �9,000).  In order to  remedy
         this matter Kingsway then contacted HMRC and paid  the  'back  tax'
         for that year on the basis of the income actually earned.  The HMRC
         accepted this and did not impose a penalty payment on him."

10. In paragraph 14 the judge recorded the Home Office Presenting Officer's
    submissions. The submissions included  a  reference  to  the  appellant
    providing Kingsway Accountants with evidence showing his earnings  from
    2010 to 2011. The Presenting Officer pointed out that the appellant had
    not produced that evidence to the Tribunal.  The Home Office Presenting
    Officer also  submitted  that  there  was  no  evidence  from  Kingsway
    Accountants about their role in assessing the appellant's tax liability
    and repaying the sum due from the  2010/2011  tax  return.   about  the
    matter.

11. In paragraph 15 the judge summarised the oral submissions made for  the
    appellant.  The decision records that Mr Farhat, who  also  represented
    before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  referred  to  an  unreported  Upper
    Tribunal decision, Parveen & Saleem v  SSHD  JR/9440/2016.   Mr  Farhat
    maintained that the respondent had not met the burden  of  proof,  that
    the appellant had trusted his  previous  accountants  and  that  weight
    should attract to the appellant  having  remedied  the  discrepant  tax
    payment from 2010/11, no penalty being imposed by HMRC.  Mr Farhat also
    referred to a Home Office questionnaire dated 7 February 2017 completed
    with the appellant when he  applied  for  ILR  which  recorded  in  the
    penultimate box that the appellant did not appear to have been  coached
    in order to provide answers and did not appear to lack credibility.

12. In paragraph 18 the judge set out the correct legal  test,  identifying
    that where there was an allegation of dishonesty the initial burden  of
    proof initially fell on the respondent and that it  was  then  for  the
    appellant to provide an innocent explanation.

13. The judge concluded  in  paragraphs  20  to  22  that  the  appellant's
    evidence on the discrepancies in the financial declarations to HMRC and
    the respondent was not credible.  The reasoning was as follows:

         "20. The Appellant's evidence as to how he conducted  his  business
             affairs in 2010-11 would suggest that he  had  been  extremely
             na�ve. I do not find this credible.  He had a Business  degree
             and a MBA in Business from  Punjab  University;  he  had  been
             working in the family business in Pakistan; and  he  had  also
             been studying a postgraduate diploma in Business Management in
             the UK.  He admitted that his studies had included modules  in
             business accounts.  Further by 2010-11 he  had  already  spent
             over three years to adjust to life in the UK.  Yet he has said
             in evidence that he allowed Agha  Associates  to  prepare  his
             accounts without ever seeing them himself or even asking  them
             to send him a copy.  He also said that he  was  never  sent  a
             copy of the completed tax return for that  year  and  that  he
             never received the invoices back from Agha Associates that  he
             had sent them for the purpose for preparing his  accounts  the
             Appellant must have been aware at least approximately  of  his
             net earnings from self-employment for  that  year  (stated  as
             �33,102 in the Tier 1 application) as  well  as  his  employed
             earnings for that year of �8,897.  I do not find  it  credible
             that he would not  have  queried  a  total  tax  liability  of
             �2,636.

         21.  There is  a  great  dearth  of  evidence  to  corroborate  his
             business activities for the year 2010-11.  He said in evidence
             that at the time of remedying his tax  default,  he  had  been
             able to re-calculate his self-employed income  for  that  year
             through invoices from Crestplus and by getting details of  his
             old accounts from Crestplus.  Yet none of  this  evidence  was
             provided for  the  appeal.   There  was  also  no  documentary
             evidence (for example in the form of business  correspondence)
             about the Appellant's dealings with Agha Associates apart from
             very  brief  emails  regarding  his  login  details  and  bank
             statements showing him having paid the firm for their work for
             him.  Whilst I accept that  it  can  be  difficult  to  access
             evidence from past years, I would expect the Appellant to have
             been able to provide the Tribunal with at least some  evidence
             from the companies for whom he worked for that year in support
             of the claimed level of work that he did for them.  Mr  Farhat
             asked me in  submissions  to  consider  the  evidence  of  the
             Appellant's work record since 2010-11.  I note in passing that
             according to HMRC records (provided by Respondent), his  total
             taxable income for  the  following  year  (2011-12)  was  only
             �20,941 (all of it being from self-employment)  which  is  far
             less than the total of over �40,000  taxable  income  that  he
             claims to have earned for 2010-11.

         22.  Having carefully considered the evidence before me, I  do  not
             believe that the Appellant is a credible witness he would have
             been aware that in order  to  gain  the  requisite  number  of
             points for a Tier 1 (general) applicant, he needed to  show  a
             sufficient level of earnings.   I  do  not  believe  that  his
             earnings were in  fact  at  the  level  claimed  or  that  the
             Appellant genuinely believed them to be at that level when the
             application was submitted and I do not  believe  that  he  has
             given a true account of his  dealings  with  Agha  Associates.
             Having considered the evidence in the round,  I  am  satisfied
             that the Respondent has met the burden of proof that was  upon
             her that the Appellant knowingly  provided  false  information
             about his earnings in his  Tier  1  application  in  order  to
             obtain leave to remain.  The true level  of  his  earnings  is
             likely to have been that reflected in the tax calculations set
             out in his self-assessment for 2010-11.  I am  satisfied  that
             the Appellant would have been well aware at the  time  of  the
             discrepancy between  the  figure  given  in  his  Home  Office
             application and the  figure  subsequently  given  in  his  tax
             return.  I find that the  Respondent  was  fully  entitled  to
             exercise her  discretion  in  refusing  the  Appellant's  long
             residence application on the basis of paragraph 322(5) of  the
             Immigration Rules in the  light  of  the  Appellant's  conduct
             which made it undesirable for him to be granted leave and thus
             profit from his previous deception."

14. The appellant appealed against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    and was granted permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  26
    September 2018.

15. Paragraph 3 of the grounds refers to the challenge being on  the  basis
    of "a sole error of law".  The grounds go on to set out that there were
    two possible  ways  in  which  the  appellant  could  be  found  to  be
    dishonest. The first was in under-declaring income in a tax  return  to
    HMRC. The second was over-declaring income  to  the  respondent  in  an
    application for leave to remain. It is worth noting that both of  those
    possibilities were encompassed within the respondent's refusal  letter,
    set out above.

16. The grounds go on to assert that at the outset of the hearing the First-
    tier Tribunal agreed to admit two unreported Upper Tribunal cases.  The
    first was the case of Sandeep Kadian v SSHD (HU/11723/2016).   In  that
    decision a Deputy Upper Tribunal judge had found that dishonesty  in  a
    tax return, in the manner alleged here, was "regrettable" but could not
    come  within  the  ambit  of  paragraph  322(5)  as  set  out  in   the
    respondent's  policy  guidance.   The  second  case  that  the  grounds
    maintain the judge was asked to admit was that of Parveen  &  Saleem  v
    SSHD JR/9440/2016.

17. The grounds go on to  argue  that,  having  admitted  these  cases,  in
    particular Kadian, the First-Tier Tribunal was precluded  from  finding
    that paragraph 322(5) could be applied to the appellant  regarding  any
    incorrect declarations to HMRC. According to  the  grounds,  that  only
    left  open  a  finding  that  the  appellant  was  dishonest   in   his
    declarations to the respondent. It was argued that the material  before
    the First-Tier Tribunal was not capable of showing that the  respondent
    had met the evidential burden of showing dishonesty in the declarations
    of income in the 2011 application for leave as no documents  from  that
    application were provided.

18. We did not find that the grounds had merit for the  following  reasons.
    Certainly, the two unreported cases referred to in the grounds were  in
    the materials before the First-Tier Tribunal. The  case  of  Parveen  &
    Saleem is referred to in paragraph 15 of the decision in the summary of
    Mr Farhat's submissions. The case of  Kadian  is  referred  to  in  the
    appellant's "briefing note" provided to the First-Tier Tribunal.

19. However, nothing in the decision shows that a  formal  application  was
    made for unreported cases to be admitted or that either of the cases of
    Kadian and Parveen &  Saleem  were  formally  admitted.   There  is  no
    reference in any of the materials before us to the First-Tier  Tribunal
    or in the decision to the detailed procedure for  admitting  unreported
    decisions, set out in paragraph 11 of the  Practice  Direction  of  the
    Senior President of Tribunals, amended on 13 November 2014.  Mr  Farhat
    did not seek to suggest that a formal application of  that  nature  was
    made to the First-Tier Tribunal. We were not referred to the record  of
    proceedings of the First-Tier Tribunal or provided with the  record  of
    proceedings or notes of the representatives who appeared  before  Judge
    Talbot. We were not provided with a witness statement  from  Mr  Farhat
    setting out what was said on this matter  in  the  First-Tier  Tribunal
    hearing. The reference to the case of Parveen & Saleem at paragraph  15
    of the decision is not an indication that such an application had  been
    made or that the judge had admitted unreported cases  or  that  he  had
    agreed to follow the ratio of those cases.

20. Put simply, it is not our conclusion that the judge "agreed" to  either
    admit or place weight on the ratios of these unreported cases.  He  was
    not restricted to considering only the possibility of dishonesty in the
    appellant's dealings with the respondent and not HMRC.

21. In any event, the judge did not find against  the  appellant  regarding
    tax declarations to HMRC. He  found  the  appellant  had  over-declared
    income to the respondent. We  found  no  error  in  that  part  of  the
    decision. At hearing  before  us,  Mr  Farhat  was  asked  whether  the
    appellant disputed the figures contained in  the  respondent's  refusal
    letter as to his tax declaration from 2010/2011 and his declaration  of
    income in his application for leave made on 26 March 2011.   Mr  Farhat
    stated that the  appellant  did  not  dispute  the  accuracy  of  those
    figures. His concession was clear. Mr Whitwell  relied  on  it  at  the
    outset of his submissions.

22. The undisputed facts before the First-tier  Tribunal  were,  therefore,
    that the figures for the declarations of income to the  respondent  and
    HMRC in 2011 as set out in the  refusal  letter  were  accurate.  Those
    figures are manifestly discrepant. As indicated in the headnote of  the
    reported case of R (on the application of Khan) v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department  (Dishonesty,  tax  return,  paragraph  322(5))
    [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC):

         (i)  Where there has been  a  significant  difference  between  the
             income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain
             and the income declared to HMRC, the  Secretary  of  State  is
             entitled to draw an inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been
             deceitful or dishonest and therefore he should be refused  ILR
             within paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules.   Such  an
             inference could  be  expected  where  there  is  no  plausible
             explanation for the discrepancy.

23. The initial evidential burden on the respondent was clearly met here by
    the discrepant figures provided to the respondent and HMRC in 2011. The
    submission to the contrary in the grounds has no force.

24. It is undisputed that the  burden  then  passed  to  the  appellant  to
    provide an innocent explanation.  The  grounds  do  not  challenge  the
    reasoning of the First-Tier Tribunal on the  appellant's  evidence  for
    the discrepant declarations and conclusion that he had been  dishonest.
    The reasoning appeared to us to be sound and in line with the  guidance
    contained in Khan on how to approach this part of  the  assessment.  It
    was open to the judge  to  place  adverse  weight  on  the  absence  of
    documents the appellant  maintained  he  had  provided  to  accountants
    relatively recently and there being nothing from  Kingsway  Accountants
    explaining how they had noticed and rectified the incorrect tax  return
    from 2010/11.

25. For these reasons, therefore, we did not find that the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal disclosed an error on a point of law.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not  disclose  an  error  on  a
point of law and shall stand.
