For the respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                         NOTICE OF ABANDONED APPEAL

 1. The appellant, Rajesh Mahamadali Kanani, date of birth  16.6.78,  is  a
    citizen of India.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Bradshaw promulgated 3.3.15, dismissing his appeal against the decision
    of the Secretary of State, dated 3.6.14, to refuse his application made
    on 5.4.14 for leave to remain in the UK on human rights  grounds.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 17.2.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Foudy refused permission to appeal on 8.5.15.
    However, when the application was renewed to the Upper Tribunal, Deputy
    Upper Tribunal Judge Norton-Taylor  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    15.7.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 24.11.15 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. By letter dated 23.11.15, the appellant's representatives,  Kiddrapinet
    Solicitors, wrote to notify the Tribunal that he had left  the  UK.  Mr
    Whitwell also produced  confirmation  of  the  appellant's  flight  and
    departure from the UK on 16.8.15, copies of which are on the case file.

 6. Under Section 104(4) of the 2002 Act, as it stood at the date  of  both
    application and decision (and in force until  20.10.14),  an  appellant
    who leaves the country is deemed to abandon his appeal.  In R  (on  the
    application of MM (Ghana)) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2012] EWCA Civ 827 it was held that for the purposes of section 104(4)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the word  "leaves"
    bore  a  purely  physical  meaning,  the  question  being  whether  the
    applicant had by his voluntary action physically left the  UK,  whether
    for a short or a long  term.  The  Court  of  Appeal  said  it  had  no
    jurisdiction to treat an application for permission  to  appeal  as  an
    application for permission to apply for judicial review  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal's decision when the appeal  against  that  decision  had  been
    abandoned under section 104(4).

 7. In the circumstances, this  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  has  been
    abandoned and by section 104(1)(b) is no longer pending. There is  thus
    no appeal against the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing the appeal stands.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an anonymity order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been abandoned.
