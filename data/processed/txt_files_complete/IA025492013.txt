                           MISS AMBREEN AZIZ KHAN

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



   1. In a decision made on  19  July  2013  I  found  that  the  First-tier
      Tribunal judge had erred in law in relying on Khatel and others (s85A;
      effect of  continuing  application)[2013]  UKUT  44  (IAC)  which  had
      subsequently been overturned in Raju & Ors [2013] EWCA Civ 754.

   2. I set aside the decision.

   3. I also said that  unless  persuaded  otherwise  by  any  response  the
      appellant before the  First-tier  Tribunal  wished  to  make  I  would
      proceed to re-make the decision dismissing the appellant's appeal.

   4. The appellant has now written arguing that  there  was  an  unresolved
      issue of fact as to whether Khatel applied and so the case  should  be
      sent to the First tier Tribunal for its finding on fact. The appellant
      also submits (correctly)  that  Raju  &  Ors  is  the  subject  of  an
      application for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.

   5. I am afraid this further application does not persuade me  to  take  a
      different view from that which I expressed in July. The clear  finding
      of the First-tier Tribunal (and nothing  now  said  by  the  appellant
      undermines it) is that the date of the award postdated the appellant's
      application. Applying Raj & Ors, the appellant's appeal must fail.

   6. The fact that there is an application to appeal to the  Supreme  Court
      for permission to appeal against  Raju  &  Ors  does  not  assist  the
      appellant. I must apply the law as it is: see e.g. SG (Iraq) EWCA  Civ
      [2013] 1 WLR 41.

   7. Accordingly I proceed as  I  earlier  said  I  might  to  re-make  the
      decision by dismissing the  appellant's  appeal.  The  respondent  was
      entitled  to  decide  that  she  had  failed  to  meet  the   relevant
      requirements of the Immigration Rules.

   8. To summarise: the First-tier Tribunal erred in law necessitating  that
      I set aside its decision. The decision I re-make  is  to  dismiss  the
      appellant's appeal.
