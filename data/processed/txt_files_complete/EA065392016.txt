Co Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant in this appeal is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department.  To  avoid  confusion,  I  refer  to  her  as  being,  "the
    claimant".  The respondent is a national of Turkey,  who  was  born  on
    26th November 1992.

2.   On 20th May 2016, the claimant refused to grant to  the  respondent  an
    EEA family permit to join his  stepmother  and  father  in  the  United
    Kingdom under Regulation 7 of the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations  2006.
    The claimant noted that the respondent was over the age of 21 years  at
    the date of decision,  had  lived  in  Turkey  all  his  life  and  was
    registered as a student at Firat University.   It  was  noted  that  as
    evidence of dependency, seven money  transfers  sent  from  the  United
    Kingdom between 2013 and 2016 had been provided by the respondent,  but
    six of these were  from  the  respondent's  father  and  one  from  the
    respondent's stepmother.  The claimant was not satisfied that these  ad
    hoc money transfers were evidence that  the  respondent  is  wholly  or
    mainly dependent on  his  stepmother.   The  claimant  noted  that  the
    stepmother  could  continue  to  provide  financial  support   to   the
    respondent from the United Kingdom.

3.   The judge heard oral evidence  from  the  respondent's  stepmother  and
    from the respondent's father.  The judge recorded that  the  stepmother
    gave evidence stating that the respondent was dependent on her and  her
    husband and needs support for school and for life generally.  He is  25
    years of age and not working.  He has never worked and was studying and
    wanted to finish his university studies and  join  the  family  in  the
    United Kingdom.  He had been supported since the age of 6.   The  judge
    recorded that the respondent's stepmother claimed that over  the  years
    she and her husband, the respondent's father, have  sent  up  to  about
    �12,000.  The judge records that  the  witness  gave  a  breakdown  for
    between 2012 and 2016.  Unfortunately, the  determination  is  unclear.
    It is not clear whether the sum of �12,000 is the total sum  which  has
    been sent to the respondent since he was 6 (he is now 25 years of  age)
    and it is not clear how much the witness claimed had been sent  to  the
    respondent between the years 2012 and 2016.

4.   The judge heard oral evidence from the respondent's father.   He  is  a
    British citizen and also a Turkish national.  He claims  that  for  the
    whole of the respondent's life he and the respondent's  stepmother  had
    been sending money to him.  The money has been sent through his  cousin
    and friend.

5.   The judge recorded that the sponsor confirmed that the profit from  the
    sponsor's business is about �14,000 pa, of which his  share  is  �7,000
    pa, because he has a business partner.  He also has rent of �100 a week
    to pay and he has three other children, who are currently in the United
    Kingdom and who he is supporting.  Before his current business  he  was
    employed as a lift engineer.  The judge found credible the evidence  of
    the EEA sponsor, that she has been  sending  money  to  the  respondent
    before she stopped working in 2010.  He  also  found  it  credible  and
    plausible that documents recording  money  transfers  would  have  been
    lost.  The judge recorded that the respondent  has  recently  concluded
    his education and is not working.

6.   The judge found the evidence of the witnesses to be credible and  found
    that the respondent is a dependant on the EEA sponsor  and  his  father
    jointly.

7.   The claimant challenged the  judge's  decision,  because  the  evidence
    before the judge was that the EEA stepmother had not been working since
    the  birth  of  her  third  child  some  six  years  earlier,  and  the
    respondent's father's take home pay is in the order of �7,000 pa,  from
    which �100 a week is paid for  rent,  between  them,  the  respondent's
    stepmother and father have three children in the United  Kingdom.   The
    evidence of the sponsor's ability to provide for the basic needs of the
    respondent had simply not, it was  suggested,  been  made  out  on  the
    evidence.  However, even if the evidence of support had been  credible,
    the issue in front of the Tribunal was whether the support provided  by
    the sponsors was necessary to enable the respondent to meet  his  basic
    needs.

8.   Reliance was placed on Lim v Entry Clearance  Officer  (Manila)  [2015]
    EWCA Civ 1383 and on paragraph 32 in particular.  The grounds submitted
    that the judge merely found that the respondent is  dependent,  without
    any further elaboration as to  whether  what  appears  to  be  sporadic
    support provided, was actually necessary to meet the respondent's basic
    needs.  The evidence before the judge was  that  the  respondent  lived
    with his mother and his grandmother  has  some  form  of  pension,  the
    implication being that if the respondent is dependent upon anybody  for
    his basic needs, it is his mother and/or his grandmother in Turkey.

9.   Mr Wilding pointed out that the judge had simply focused  on  the  sole
    issue of whether money was being sent back to  Turkey  or  not,  rather
    than whether the respondent is in a position to support himself or not.
     The test is highlighted by Lord Justice Elias at paragraph 32 of  Lim.
     The respondent lives with his mother and  grandmother.   The  evidence
    which appears to have been given to the judge (it is not clear  because
    the  judge  does  not  make  clear  findings  of  fact)  is  that   the
    respondent's stepmother and father have sent about �12,000 to  him  and
    they gave a breakdown for  the  years  2012-2016.   Unfortunately,  the
    judge does not record what those were.  However,  the  evidence  before
    the judge in the  form  of  accounts  from  the  respondent's  father's
    business show amongst other things, that during  the  year  ended  31st
    July, 2016, the respondent's father earned a net �5,105 from  his  fish
    and chip shop business from which he is responsible  for  his  rent  of
    �100 per week and for the maintenance of himself, his  wife  and  three
    children in the United Kingdom.

10.      For the year ended  31st  July,  2014,  the  net  profit  from  the
    father's business was some �6,437 and so it  was  simply  not  credible
    that the respondent's father and stepmother,  who  herself  had  ceased
    working some six years earlier, could have sent money in recent  years.
    However, the real error in  the  judge's  determination,  submitted  Mr
    Wilding was that First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio had failed to make  any
    assessment of the respondent's needs, or of his dependency.

11.  Mr Thoree suggested that the determination clearly shows a remittal  of
    monies to the respondent by his  family  in  the  United  Kingdom.   Mr
    Thoree suggested that the respondent's basic needs would be  less  than
    �70 per week which is what the United Kingdom  Government  believes  is
    necessary for  one  person's  maintenance.   The  cost  of  living,  he
    submitted, would be much cheaper in Turkey and so it would be far  less
    than �70 per week.  The respondent would, of course, require money  for
    food,  heat,  light,  clothing  and  presumably  some  monies  for  his
    entertainment and personal enjoyment.  The sponsor claimed to have sent
    �4,000 and in giving evidence to the judge, asserted that it  had  come
    from his business.  Mr Thoree  submitted  that  the  determination  was
    sound and should be upheld.  I reserved my decision.

12.  Giving judgment in Siew Lian Lin v  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (Manila)
    [2015] EWCA Civ 1383 Lord Justice Elias said at paragraph 25 this:

         "In my judgment, this makes it unambiguously clear that it  is  not
         enough simply to show that financial support is in fact provided by
         the EU citizen to the family member.  There are numerous references
         in these paragraphs which are only consistent with  a  notion  that
         the family member must need the support from his or  her  relatives
         in order to meet his or her basic needs.  For example, paragraph 20
         refers to the existence of 'a situation of real  dependence'  which
         must be established; paragraph 22 is even more striking and  refers
         to the need for material support in the  state  of  origin  of  the
         descendant 'who is not in  a  position  to  support  himself';  and
         paragraph  24  requires  that  the  financial   support   must   be
         'necessary' for the putative defendant to support  himself  in  the
         state of origin.  It is also pertinent to note that in paragraph 22
         in the context of considering the Citizens  Directive,  the  courts
         specifically approve the test  adopted  in  Jia  at  paragraph  37,
         namely that:


             "the need for material support must  exist  in  the  state  of
             origin of those relatives or the state whence they came at the
             time when they applied to join the community national'."

13.  At paragraph 32 Lord Justice Elias went on to say:-

         "In my judgment, the critical question is whether the  claimant  is
         in fact in a position to support himself or not and Reyes now makes
         that clear beyond doubt, in my view.  That is a  simple  matter  of
         fact.  If he can support himself, there is no dependency,  even  if
         he is given financial support by the EU citizen.  Those  additional
         resources are not necessary to enable him to meet his basic  needs.
         If, on the other hand  he  cannot  support  himself  from  his  own
         resources, the court will not  ask  why  that  is  the  case,  save
         perhaps where there is an  abuse  of  rights.   The  fact  that  he
         chooses not to get a job and become self-supporting is  irrelevant.
         It follows that on the fact of this case there was  no  dependency.
         The  appellant  had  the  funds  to  support  herself.    She   was
         financially independent and did not need the  additional  resources
         for the purpose of meeting her basic needs."

14.  The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  has  not  considered  the  question  of
    whether or  not  the  respondent  can  support  himself  from  his  own
    resources.  Indeed, there was very little evidence adduced  at  all  in
    relation to his situation, other than the fact that he lives  with  his
    mother and grandmother, that his mother does  not  work  and  that  the
    grandmother  has  some  form  of  pension,  presumably  earned  by  the
    grandfather.  The respondent's financial situation  in  Turkey  is  far
    from clear.  The respondent was paying for his dormitory fees while  he
    was in full-time education.  His education was free in  Turkey  and  he
    has now completed it.  He now lives with his  mother  and  grandmother,
    but the respondent has adduced no evidence at all to show  that  he  is
    dependent on money being sent to him by his father or stepmother and in
    any event, as I have pointed out, it is unclear precisely  what  monies
    have  been  sent  to  him,  given  evidence  of  the  earnings  of  the
    respondent's father and the  lack  evidence  of  earnings  now  by  the
    respondent's  stepmother.   I  have  concluded,  therefore  ,that   the
    determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio does contain  an  error
    of law, namely a failure to consider the  question  highlighted  by  Mr
    Justice Elias in paragraph 32 of Lim.

15.  However, on the evidence before the judge, it was not possible for  the
    judge to have made a finding on whether the respondent is in fact in  a
    position to support himself or not.   There  was  a  complete  lack  of
    evidence.   There  was  evidence  that  the  respondent's  father   and
    stepmother had over the years been sending some money, but  a  lack  of
    evidence as to the ability of the respondent  to  support  himself.   I
    have concluded therefore that  the  respondent  has  simply  failed  to
    demonstrate that he is wholly or mainly dependent  on  his  father  and
    stepmother.

16.  The making of the decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Adio  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law.  The error of  the  judge  is
    material because  he  has  failed  to  consider  the  question  of  the
    respondent's position to support himself  or  not.   I  set  aside  the
    decision  of  Judge  Adio  and  remake  the   decision   myself.    The
    respondent's appeal is dismissed.
