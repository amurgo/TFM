For the Appellant:     Mr A Khan (Solicitor)
For the Respondent:    Ms L Kenny (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The  appellant's  appeal  against  a  decision  to  refuse  her  entry
    clearance under Appendix FM, as the spouse of a  British  citizen,  was
    allowed by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Elliman  ("the  Judge")  in  a
    determination promulgated on 27th June 2014.

2.   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  ("ECO")  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    appellant met the financial requirements contained in  Appendix  FM  or
    that she could meet the requirements of the rules in  relation  to  her
    proficiency in English.  The judge found that the  appellant's  sponsor
    fell to be treated as an employee for the purposes of his income,  even
    though he also held office as a director of a company.  Appendix  FM-SE
    set out the evidence required in this  context.   Taking  into  account
    P60s, wage slips and other items, the judge found  that  the  sponsor's
    income amounted to a total of �19,000 per annum and that the  financial
    requirements of  the  rules  were  met.   So  far  as  the  appellant's
    proficiency in English  was  concerned,  the  judge  found  that  those
    requirements were also met.

3.   In an application for permission  to  appeal,  the  respondent  (it  is
    convenient to refer to the parties as they were before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal) contended that the judge erred in failing to have  regard  to
    paragraph 9 of Appendix FM-SE, which fell to be applied as the  sponsor
    was a  director,  albeit  a  director  paid  a  salary  by  a  company.
    Specified evidence was required for directors and it was  not  apparent
    that the evidence was available.  The issue was not considered  by  the
    judge.  The author of the grounds observed that if the  current  income
    did  exceed  the  threshold  and  the  specified  evidence  were   made
    available, a fresh application could be  made  (which  might  succeed).
    There was no challenge  to  the  judge's  finding  on  the  appellant's
    proficiency in the English language.

4.   Permission to appeal was granted on 6th  November  2014.   The  grantor
    noted that the judge may have failed to deal with the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager's review, where it was  observed  that  the  correct  documents
    reflecting income as a director were  not  provided.   Paragraph  9  of
    Appendix FM-SE applied to applications decided on or  after  6th  April
    2013, the date of the ECO's decision being  7th  June  that  year.   It
    applied where sponsors relied on income in a limited company  in  which
    they were directors and in which a limited number of  people  including
    the sponsor or other close family members held  shares.   The  evidence
    suggested that this was such a case.

5.   In directions made by the Principal Resident Judge,  the  parties  were
    advised that if the decision were set aside and re-made,  any  evidence
    required could be considered at the hearing.

Submissions on Error of Law

6.   Mr Khan provided copies of the bundles which  were  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal  Judge,  including  "bundle  2",  dealing  with  evidence
    regarding the sponsor's status as a director, and a skeleton  argument.



7.   Ms Kenny said that the appellant's case was advanced on the basis  that
    the sponsor was an employee.  The accountants who  provided  supporting
    letters  confirmed  that  the  sponsor  was  indeed  an  employee.   At
    paragraph 7 of the determination, the judge noted, on the  other  hand,
    that the sponsor was also a director.  Nonetheless,  at  paragraph  11,
    she found that  he  fell  to  be  treated  as  an  employee.   In  that
    paragraph, the judge referred to "the appellant" but  it  was  apparent
    this was an error and that she had the sponsor in mind.

8.   The difficulty was that the Entry Clearance Manager on review  assessed
    the application as one in which paragraph 9 of Appendix FM-SE  fell  to
    be applied.  This was because the sponsor held office  as  a  director.
    So  far  as  the  two  bundles  were  concerned,  paragraph  8  of  the
    determination showed  that  the  judge  had  two  bundles  before  her,
    including bundle 2 containing  evidence  relevant  to  paragraph  9  of
    Appendix FM-SE.

9.   The judge did not address the requirements for directors,  set  out  in
    paragraph 9 of Appendix FM-SE and it was simply not the case  that  the
    appellant had an option to put her sponsor forward as an employee on an
    alternative basis.  It followed that the judge erred at paragraph 11 of
    the determination.  Whether or not the sponsor was an employee, if  the
    income  threshold  was  exceeded,  and  so  long  as   the   evidential
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE were met, a fresh application  could  be
    made.

10.  Mr Khan said that in the ECO's notice of decision, the  sponsor's  work
    as a chef and status as  a  director  were  noted.   HMRC  treated  the
    sponsor as an employee between 2009 and 2014.  The ECO noted  that  the
    sponsor was not recorded as being in self-employment.  He  treated  the
    sponsor as an employee.  The sponsor's accountant  maintained  that  he
    was an employee and, also, a director.  The letter from the accountants
    at page 1 of bundle 2 showed that the sponsor was taxed under  Schedule
    E, appropriately.  He was given a P60 over the last five  years,  which
    he might not expect to  receive  as  a  director.   The  true  position
    appeared to be that he was paid as an employee but was  a  director  of
    the company.

11.  Evidence was put in front of the  judge  regarding  both  aspects.   In
    other words, the case was advanced on the basis that the sponsor was an
    employee and that the income threshold was  met  and,  also,  that  the
    evidential requirements of Appendix  FM-SE  concerning  directors  were
    also met.  The judge did not look at  the  second  bundle  because  she
    found that the sponsor was an employee and that he earned  �19,000  per
    annum.  This was unfortunate as the appellant's case could  succeed  on
    the basis that the sponsor was a director, in the light of the evidence
    showing that the relevant requirements of the rules were met.

12.  Even though the judge made no mention of paragraph 9  of  Appendix  FM-
    SE, the evidence was there, in bundle 2.  Mr Khan  said  that,  on  the
    other hand, it might be argued that  the  judge  did  not  err  as  she
    correctly treated the sponsor as an employee.

13.  Ms Kenny said briefly in response that the letter from  the  accountant
    dated 25th February 2013, in the evidence, described the sponsor  as  a
    50 percent shareholder and a director.  The Entry Clearance Manager was
    right to say that paragraph 9 of Appendix FM-SE had to be considered.

Conclusion on Error of Law

14.  I conclude that the judge did err in law in assessing the case  on  the
    basis that the sponsor was an employee.  The error appears at paragraph
    11 of the determination.  There is no inconsistency or tension  between
    the sponsor's status as an employee, receiving a wage from the company,
    and holding office as a director.   The  nature  of  the  business  and
    company he was associated with  led  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  to
    conclude that paragraph  9  of  Appendix  FM-SE  fell  to  be  applied,
    regarding the evidence required to accompany the application.  Although
    the judge noted that in the review "the appellant" was a director of  a
    company (she meant here the sponsor, as she did at paragraph 11), there
    was no engagement with this part of the  respondent's  case,  no  doubt
    because the judge concluded that the sponsor was an employee.  As noted
    above, there is no inconsistency between that status and his status  as
    a director.  I conclude that the judge materially erred in law and that
    the decision must be set aside and remade.  Mr Khan said that bundle  2
    was available to deal with the sponsor's status as a  director.   There
    was nothing in the determination about this bundle, save  in  paragraph
    8, where there is reference to two bundles of  documents  being  before
    the judge.

15.  In the light of the Principal Resident Judge's directions, I asked  the
    two representatives whether the decision, having been set aside,  could
    be re-made at the hearing.  They agreed that it could.

Remaking the Decision

16.  A practical problem  then  arose.   Mr  Khan  produced  from  his  file
    evidence that a Bengali (Sylheti) interpreter had been requested.  None
    was available, as became clear once enquiries were  made.   There  was,
    nonetheless, no application for an  adjournment.   Mr  Khan  said  that
    bundle 2 contained the evidence required to show that the  requirements
    of paragraph 9(a) of Appendix FM-SE were met.

17.  The rules required specified evidence  to  accompany  the  application.
    Mr Khan said that the  appellant's  case  was  that  all  the  relevant
    documents accompanied the application and so the appellant  could  show
    that the requirements of the rules were met.

18.  The Entry Clearance Manager  set  out  the  required  evidence  on  the
    second page of the review statement.  Turning to  that  list,  Mr  Khan
    said that bundle 2 contained a company tax return (CT600) at pages 8 to
    11.  This was dated 13th February 2014.  There  was  also  evidence  of
    registration with the Registrar of Companies.  This document was  dated
    9th February 2005.  The required accounts appeared at pages 21 to 31 of
    the bundle and the business bank statements at pages  36  to  65.   The
    requirement to show a current appointment report from  Companies  House
    was met by the document at pages 2 to 5.  This document was dated  15th
    February 2013.

19.  From the second list of documents  in  the  review  statement,  one  of
    which  had  to  be  provided  in  addition  to  the  documents  already
    identified, the appellant would rely on the VAT registration at page  7
    and pages 13 to 14 of the bundle and the wage slips.

20.  Ms Kenny at this point raised the  question  of  the  bank  statements,
    said to have accompanied the application.  Those appearing in bundle  2
    covered a far longer period of time than the "same twelve month  period
    as the company tax returns CT600" required by the rules.  Mr Khan  said
    that this  was  so  but,  nonetheless,  the  bank  statements  for  the
    particular twelve months did accompany the application.  The  appellant
    would say that the evidence was all there.

21.  Ms  Kenny  responded  by  drawing  attention  to  "checklist  A"  which
    appeared in the respondent's bundle, listing the documents submitted at
    the Visa Application Centre.   There  was  no  mention  there  of  bank
    statements (save for sponsor's bank statements for the last six months)
    and in the "Other Documents" part, there was only mention of a TB test.
     There was nothing concerning documents identified as being required by
    the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  in  the  review  statement.   In   that
    statement, mention was also made of "checklist B", which also  appeared
    in the respondent's bundle.  Again, this suggested that bank statements
    were not submitted (there were no "ticks" applied in the relevant parts
    of the form) although mention was made of an accountant's letter.   All
    of this supported the Entry Clearance Manager's  express  finding  that
    the relevant documents were not provided.

22.  Mr Khan  said  that  in  the  notice  of  decision,  the  ECO  had  not
    considered paragraph 9(a) of Appendix FM-SE.  In any event, it was  not
    uncommon for documents to be lost.  This happened in many cases and the
    bank statements might have been provided but  not  recorded  as  having
    been received by the overseas post.  The ECO was focusing on the  wrong
    case.  Moreover,  the  ECO  did  refer  to  a  bank  account  and  bank
    statements, albeit in the context of six months'  bank  statements  and
    payslips.  Mr Khan said that his firm took over the case in February or
    March 2014, from solicitors who were instructed at an earlier stage.

Findings and Conclusions

23.  In this appeal, the appellant must prove  the  facts  and  matters  she
    relies upon and  the  standard  of  proof  is  that  of  a  balance  of
    probabilities.

24.  Having set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  issue
    between the parties in remaking it is a narrow one.  Was there evidence
    showing that the requirements of paragraph 9(a) of  Appendix  FM-SE  of
    the rules were met?  Did the evidence  accompany  the  application,  as
    required?

25.  Mr Khan assiduously took the Tribunal through the  documents  contained
    in bundle 2, showing that they addressed the requirements of the rules.
     He said that this bundle was  available  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge but, in the  light  of  her  finding  that  the  sponsor  was  an
    employee, she did not consider it or take it into account.  Mr Khan  is
    to be commended for  the  preparation  of  the  bundle,  in  which  the
    relevant items appear.

26.  The fundamental difficulty, however, is  that  the  appellant  has  not
    shown, on a balance of probabilities, that  the  documents  accompanied
    the application.  There is no reason to doubt Mr Khan's submission that
    it is not uncommon for documents to be lost or to go astray at overseas
    posts.  Nonetheless, the Entry Clearance Manager expressly stated  that
    the relevant documents were not provided  and  drew  attention  to  two
    checklists.  Checklist A  was  signed  by  the  appellant  herself  and
    checklist B appears to have been signed on her behalf.  The first shows
    the documents which accompanied the application and the  second,  those
    which accompanied the appeal.  Neither records the submission  of  bank
    statements covering the same period of twelve months as the CT600.   If
    the documents were  provided  in  support,  with  the  application,  as
    opposed to appearing in the carefully prepared  bundle,  that  is  very
    surprising.

27.  The other fundamental problem is that the CT600, the first document  in
    the list referred to by the Entry Clearance Manager, and required under
    the rules, is dated 13th February 2014, consistent  with  the  document
    being obtained in readiness for the appeal but wholly inconsistent with
    the claim that the document accompanied the application, made in  March
    2013.  The first page of the  CT600  return  shows  that  it  has  been
    prepared in relation to the year 29th February 2012  to  27th  February
    2013, and this demonstrates that the year - "2014" - which  appears  at
    the end of the document was not the result of an accidental  slip.   In
    other words, as  the  relevant  year  of  assessment  ends  after  13th
    February, it is perfectly clear that the author of the document created
    it in early 2014 and not early 2013.

28.  In summary, taking into  account  the  clear  statement  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager  that  the  documents  were  not  provided  with  the
    application and the content of the two  checklists,  I  find  that  the
    appellant has not discharged the burden of proof upon her.   Mr  Khan's
    no doubt pertinent observations about lost documents is insufficient to
    show that the  required  items  accompanied  the  application  and  the
    available evidence strongly suggests that they did not.   In  addition,
    one of the documents required to be provided, the  CT600  return,  only
    came into being long after the date of application  and  so  could  not
    have accompanied it.

29.  For these reasons, I conclude that the requirements of the  rules  were
    not met and so the appeal falls to be dismissed.  No case was  advanced
    on an Article 8 basis (the grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal
    contain nothing in this context and no submissions were made  regarding
    the appellant's human rights).

30.  The evidence  available  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  carefully  gathered
    together by Mr Khan, suggests that the requirements of  the  rules  may
    well now be met, in the light of the sponsor's  current  circumstances.
    As noted by the author of the application for permission to appeal  and
    by Ms Kenny in her submissions,  there  is  ample  scope  for  a  fresh
    application which, although entirely a matter for  the  decision-maker,
    has every prospect of success.

31.  In summary, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  set  aside  and
    re-made as follows:  Appeal dismissed.
