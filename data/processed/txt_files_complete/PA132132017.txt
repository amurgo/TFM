For the Appellant:     Mr.  S Ell, Counsel instructed by Maya Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr. C Bates, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Fiji.  On 28th November 2017, the
    respondent made a decision to refuse a protection and human rights
    claims made by the appellant. Those claims were made by the appellant
    in response to notification served upon him in June 2017, that the
    respondent had decided to make a deportation order against him under
    s5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 ("the 1971 Act") because his presence
    in the United Kingdom is not conducive to the public good. The decision
    attracted a right of appeal and the appellant duly appealed to the
    First-tier Tribunal ("FtT"). His appeal was heard and dismissed for the
    reasons set out in a decision promulgated by FtT Judge Pacey on 25th
    July 2018.  The FtT Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal on asylum
    grounds.


 2. The FtT Judge did not make an anonymity direction. Although no
    application is made before me, the appeal concerns a claim for asylum
    and international protection and in my judgement, it is appropriate for
    an anonymity order to be made under Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  SVL is granted anonymity throughout these
    proceedings. No report of these proceedings shall directly or
    indirectly identify him.  This direction applies both to the appellant
    and to the respondent. Failure to comply with this direction could lead
    to proceedings being brought for contempt of court.


 3. The appellant has a lengthy immigration history that I do not repeat in
    this decision. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that the
    appellant entered the United Kingdom in November 2005 with a Multi
    visit visa valid until 14 December 2005. He joined the British Army,
    and was subsequently granted exemption under the 1971 Act for the
    duration of his service with the British Army. He was discharged from
    the British Army on the 30 September 2009.  There then followed a
    failed application for indefinite leave to remain outside of the rules
    on compassionate grounds, and applications for Assisted Voluntary
    Return.   The appellant made a claim for asylum in April 2014, but
    failed to attend an asylum interview in March 2015.  Between August
    2015 and June 2017, the appellant was convicted of various offences,
    leading to the decision to deport in June 2017.


 4. A brief summary of the account that is relied upon by the appellant in
    support of his claim that he cannot return to Fiji, is set out at
    paragraph [8] of the decision of the FtT Judge.  At paragraphs [9] to
    [42] of her decision, the FtT Judge sets out the evidence that she
    received.  At paragraphs [58] to [83], the FtT Judge sets out her
    findings and conclusions.  The Judge records at paragraph [56] of her
    decision, that counsel for the appellant had confirmed that the
    appellant does not rely upon Article 8, because he does not have
    contact with his child. At paragraph [57], the Judge stated:


         "The issue therefore is whether I accept the appellant as credible
         in his claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution on return
         to Fiji because of his imputed political opinion."


 5. At paragraph [83], the FtT Judge concludes as follows:


         "For the above reasons I do not accept the Appellant's account as
         credible and I do not accept that he has a well founded fear of
         persecution for a Convention reason (noting of course that imputed
         political opinion is a Convention reason)."


 6. The appellant advances three grounds of appeal. First, the Judge's
    approach to credibility is incoherent and unsustainable because the
    Judge accepted at paragraph [75] of her decision, that the appellant
    has a genuine subjective fear of persecution, but then went on to draw
    adverse inferences as to the appellant's credibility before concluding
    that she did not accept the appellant's account as credible. As the
    credibility of the account was the issue at the heart of the appeal, it
    was incumbent upon the Judge to make coherent findings as to the core
    of the account relied upon by the appellant.  Second, in reaching her
    decision as to whether the appellant's subjective fear is objectively
    well-founded, the FtT Judge failed to give any adequate weight to the
    material evidence. The appellant claims that that is particularly
    relevant here, because it was common ground that the appellant had
    previously been tortured in Fiji, and the Judge should have regarded
    that as a serious indication of the appellant's well-founded fear of
    persecution, and the risk of serious harm, upon return.  Finally, the
    Judge erred in her assessment of the expert evidence of Dr
    Presterudstuen.  There was no criticism of the expert's qualifications
    or expertise, and the purpose of the expert's report was to assist the
    Judge by providing objective information regarding conditions in Fiji.
    The appellant claims that it is not clear why the expert's decision not
    to interview the appellant is relevant to the weight that the Judge
    attaches to the report, and the Judge erred in her consideration of the
    cautious language used by the expert, by taking the extracts relied
    upon out of context, and without properly considering the report as a
    whole.


 7. Permission to appeal was granted by FtT Judge Scott Baker on 22nd
    August 2018 and the matter comes before me to consider whether the
    decision of the FtT Judge involved the making of a material error of
    law, and if so, to remake the decision.


 8. Mr Ell submits that the respondent accepted that the appellant is a
    national of Fiji and that the claim advanced by the appellant engages
    the Refugee Convention.  The respondent accepted that the appellant was
    tortured as he had described by the Fiji military.  He submits that at
    paragraph [58] of her decision, the FtT Judge acknowledged that the
    respondent accepts that the appellant was tortured, but irrationally
    made an adverse credibility finding without identifying the particular
    aspects of the claim that are accepted or rejected, before determining
    whether the appellant would be at risk upon return. He submits that the
    Judge accepted that the appellant has a subjective fear of return, and
    that in her analysis of the risk upon return, the Judge refers to
    selected extracts from the expert's report without considering the
    report as a whole, and without taking into account in that assessment,
    the undisputed fact that the appellant has previously been tortured by
    the military.  Mr Ell submits that the Judge failed to make findings as
    to the core of the appellant's account, and that failure has impacted
    upon the Judge's assessment of the risk upon return.


 9. In reply, Mr Bates submits that the Judge properly noted for herself
    that the appellant had previously been tortured, and she properly noted
    that the issue for the Tribunal, was the risk upon return.  He submits
    that the focus was rightly upon what would happen upon return now. He
    submits that the Judge was right to recognise that there has been a
    significant passage of time since the events that are relied upon by
    the appellant, and in making an assessment of the risk upon return and
    the credibility of the appellant, the Judge was entitled to take into
    account matters such as the applications for assisted voluntary return
    made by the appellant, and the appellant's evidence concerning his
    father and uncle. Mr Bates submits that at paragraph [66], the Judge
    correctly considered what would happen now, in light of all
    circumstances. In her analysis of the risk upon return, he submits, the
    FtT Judge considered the expert evidence relied upon by the appellant
    and it was open to the judge to note that the expert had been cautious.
    He submits that the weight to be attached to the evidence was
    ultimately a matter for the Judge, and the conclusion reached by the
    Judge, was one that was properly open to her given the passage of time,
    the profile of the family, the appellant's applications for voluntary
    return, and the overall conclusions of the expert.


Discussion


10. I remind myself of the observations made by Mr. Justice  Hadon-Cave  in
    Budhathoki (reasons for decisions) [2014] UKUT 00341 (IAC);


         "It is generally unnecessary and unhelpful for First-tier  Tribunal
         judgments to rehearse every detail or issue raised in a case.  This
         leads to judgments becoming overly long and confused and is  not  a
         proportionate approach to deciding cases. It is, however, necessary
         for judges to identify and resolve key conflicts  in  the  evidence
         and explain in clear and brief terms their  reasons,  so  that  the
         parties can understand why they have won or lost."


11. I have also had regard to the decision of the Upper Tribunal in  Shizad
    (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013] UKUT 00085 IAC where it  was
    stated in the head note that:


         "Although there is a legal duty to give a brief explanation of  the
         conclusions on the central issue on which the appeal is determined,
         those reasons need not be extensive if the  decision  makes  sense,
         having regard to the material accepted by the judge."


12. It is in that context that I have considered the grounds of appeal and
    the submissions that have been advanced on behalf of the appellant.
    The Judge noted at paragraph [56] of her decision that the issue in the
    appeal was whether the Judge accepts the appellant as credible in his
    claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution on return to Fiji.  In
    the decision dated 28th November 2017, the respondent stated that in
    the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the respondent was
    prepared to accept that the appellant was tortured as he had described,
    by the Fiji military.  That had occurred whilst the appellant was in
    Fiji between December 2008 and February 2009.  The appellant claimed
    that he was tortured and interrogated for two nights when he was held
    at a military camp.  The Judge noted at paragraph [47] of her decision,
    the submission made on behalf of the respondent that although the
    respondent accepts that the appellant was tortured as he claimed, the
    respondent did not accept that the appellant's life would be in danger
    now.  The respondent did not accept the appellant's claim that he would
    be at risk upon return now, and did not accept that the appellant's
    name is on a blacklist held by the authorities so that he would receive
    special attention from the security forces upon return.


13. There is no doubt that the Judge proceeds upon the premise that the
    respondent had accepted that the applicant had been tortured in Fiji.
    That concession is noted by the Judge at paragraph [57] of her
    decision.


14. The core of the appellant's account is that he is at risk upon return,
    because he was put on a blacklist, a claim that was supported, as the
    Judge notes at paragraph [60], by the appellant's uncle.


15. There is unfortunately no clear decision as to whether the Judge
    accepted that the appellant's name was put on a blacklist.  At
    paragraph [60], the Judge states that it is "..  unclear how his uncle
    was made aware of this..", but that is not to say that the account is
    rejected. At paragraph [60], the Judge notes that the letter from the
    appellant's uncle was in any event written 4� years ago, and cannot
    stand as evidence of probative value of the situation in mid-2018.
    Whilst I accept that the issue for the Tribunal was the risk upon
    return now, in my judgement it was incumbent upon the Judge to identify
    the particular aspects of the claim that are accepted or rejected,
    before determining whether the appellant would be at risk upon return
    now.  Although the Judge appears, at paragraph [60], to say that the
    appellant's claim that he is on a blacklist gains no real support from
    his uncle because it is unclear how is uncle was made aware of that, in
    my judgement the appellant was entitled to a clear finding as to
    whether that aspect of his claim was accepted or rejected by the Judge.
    Whether or not the appellant is on a blacklist, is capable of being
    relevant to the interest that the authorities would have in the
    appellant upon return, and by extension, the risk upon return.


16. The Judge carefully considered the evidence before her from various
    individuals supporting the appellant's claim that he is at risk upon
    return.  In my judgement, it was open to the Judge to attach little
    weight to that evidence for the reasons identified.  On its own, I
    would not have found there to be an error of law in the decision of the
    FtT Judge because of the Judge's assessment of the evidence, including
    the expert evidence, but I cannot be satisfied that the Judge would
    have reached the same conclusion if she had found that the appellant
    was on a blacklist.  A finding upon what was a central part of the
    appellant's claim, was clearly necessary.


17. The assessment of risk upon return and credibility is always a highly
    fact sensitive task.  It does not follow from the fact that the Judge
    accepted that the appellant has a subjective fear, that the fear is
    objectively well-founded.  In fact, it is clear from a careful reading
    of paragraph [75] of the decision, that the Judge was referring to the
    assessment by Dr Wootton that the appellant's subjective fear appeared
    to be genuine.  That is not to say that the appellant's account of
    events was accepted by the Judge.  It was for the Judge to consider the
    ingredients of the story, and the story as a whole, by reference to all
    the evidence available to the Tribunal.  It was for the Tribunal to
    make its own findings on whether, and to what extent, the appellant's
    account is credible. In my judgement the FtT Judge failed to make
    adequate findings of fact as to those aspects of the claim that lay at
    the heart of the claim.


18. If follows that in my judgement, the decision of the FtT Judge is
    infected by a material error of law and the appeal is allowed.


19. I must then consider whether to remit the case to the FtT, or to re-
    make the decision myself. In my judgment, the appropriate course is to
    remit the matter to the FtT for hearing afresh with no findings
    preserved. In reaching my decision, I have taken into account paragraph
    7.2 of the Senior President's Practice Statement of 25th September
    2012.  In my view, in determining the appeal, the nature and extent of
    any judicial fact-finding necessary will be extensive. The parties will
    be advised of the date of the First-tier Tribunal hearing in due
    course.
