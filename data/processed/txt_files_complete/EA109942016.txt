    Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules

         Upon  the  determination  by  First-Tier  Tribunal   Judge   Watson
         promulgated on 1st February 2018 disclosing  a  material  error  of
         law, the appellant and his legal representatives  not  having  been
         notified of the hearing date, and being set aside on  3rd  December
         2018.

         And upon the parties agreeing that the appellant has  not  had  the
         benefit of an appeal and that the proper course is for  the  appeal
         to be remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  re-hearing,  no

    The appeal in the Upper Tribunal is allowed.  The decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal is set aside for legal error.   The  appeal  against  the
    decision giving rise to  the  appeal  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.
