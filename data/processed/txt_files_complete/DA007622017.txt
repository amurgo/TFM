Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Whilst no anonymity direction was made earlier in the  proceedings,  we  now
make an anonymity direction because the case involves a  child.  Unless  and
until a tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is  granted
anonymity. No report of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly
identify him or any member of his family. This  direction  applies  both  to
the appellant and to the respondent.


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A. Berry, Counsel, instructed by Alexander James,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Poland, born 30 April 1973  who  appeals
    against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to  refuse  his  appeal
    against deportation in a decision promulgated on 29 August 2018.

 2. In 2004 the appellant was living and working in  Germany  when  he  was
    convicted,  in  absence  by  a  court  in  Poland,  and  sentenced   to
    imprisonment for 15 months for an offence of theft committed  in  2000.
    When he had returned to Poland for a funeral in  October  2005  he  was
    imprisoned in respect of other offences, but not the 15 month  sentence
    imposed in 2004.

 3. After  very  considerable  delay,  the  Polish  authorities  sought  an
    extradition warrant which was granted on 12 June 2013, but  that  order
    was quashed on appeal by Collins J in the Administrative  Court  on  23
    October 2013 on the basis that it would be  oppressive  to  return  the
    appellant after "appalling and unexplained  delays."  The  decision  is
    reported at [2013] EWHC 3584 (Admin).

 4. The High Court found that the summons had been issued in February  2004
    and dispatched to the appellant's address in Poland for  a  hearing  in
    late March 2004 but the appellant failed to collect it, which may  have
    been because he was in Germany at  the  time.  In  due  course  he  was
    extradited from Germany to Poland on other charges in order to serve  a
    sentence in 2005. A competent means of bringing  the  appellant  before
    the court in respect of his outstanding sentence was  not  pursued,  he
    was released from Prison in Poland and came to the UK. Thereafter there
    was an unexplained delay of  6  years  before  the  Polish  authorities
    issued an arrest warrant which failed for procedural reasons within the
    UK. The warrant was not rendered valid until January 2012  and  it  was
    not until June 2013 that the  extradition  proceedings  came  before  a
    District Judge who concluded that the appellant must have known of  the
    proceedings and had avoided them deliberately. The High Court  was  not
    satisfied that the appellant must have known or  that  he  deliberately
    absented himself and that the District Judge had erred in this  regard.
    The unexplained delay  was  quite  appalling  such  that  it  would  be
    oppressive to return the appellant in the  circumstances  for  a  theft
    valued at �1600.

 5. The appellant came to the UK towards the end of 2004 and on 22 November
    2004 was issued with an  Accession  State  Worker  Registration  Scheme
    certificate which entitled him to seek work in the UK. He left his then
    wife and their daughter L in Germany. The appellant worked in the UK on
    building sites, in pubs restaurants and in retail. His daughter L would
    come to the UK to visit him from 2005 when she was 8 or 9.

 6. In 2010 the appellant formed a relationship with his now fianc�e,  also
    a Polish national living in the UK, and in 2012  they  had  a  daughter
    together in the UK. The fianc� has an  older  child  of  her  own.  The
    fianc�e has strong family ties in Poland where she regularly returns to
    visit family. The appellant's daughter L came to live in the UK in 2013
    as an adult. She now lives with the appellant and his fianc�e and is  a
    student.

 7. On 21 July 2016, at  an  English  Crown  Court,  he  was  sentenced  to
    imprisonment for 12 months for five charges of  fraudulent  evasion  of
    duty  payable  on  cigarettes  and  tobacco.  He  was  issued  with   a
    deportation order on 4 December 2017 pursuant to Regulation  23(6)  (b)
    of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2016  that  it
    was justified on the grounds of public policy. He then provided further
    information to the Secretary of State who considered his case again and
    on 7 March 2018 again decided to deport  the  appellant.  This  is  the
    decision against which he appealed.

 8. The Secretary of State accepted that the appellant had been resident in
    the UK in accordance with EEA Regulations for a  continuous  period  of
    five years such that he could only be removed  on  serious  grounds  of
    public policy and public security in order to protect  the  fundamental
    interests of society.

The hearing before the FtT

 9. The appellant had provided substantial amounts of  paperwork  including
    tax documents, payslips and bills intended to demonstrate that  he  had
    been living and working continuously in the  UK  for  ten  years.  This
    material was available to the FtT at the hearing  of  his  appeal.  The
    appellant gave evidence as did his adult daughter L and his fianc�  who
    are both Polish nationals.

The determination

10. The numbering of the paragraphs in this determination has gone awry: it
    proceeds normally with paras 1-55 and then has para 36 which is plainly
    meant to be para 56; it then has paras 57, 57, before normal  numbering
    resumes from 58-67. For clarity, we shall refer to para 36 on page 8 as
    para 36 and to para 36 on page 10 as para 56. We shall refer to para 57
    when referring to para 57 on page 10 and para  57A  when  referring  to
    para 57 on page 11.

11. The FtTJ set out her findings in fact between  paras  9  and  22  which
    include those narrated above.

12. At paras 18 and 19 the FtTJ analysed the documentation provided and its
    implications.

13. At para 20 she noted that since he has been in the UK the appellant has
    accumulated a number of criminal convictions:

       . February 2011, possession of drugs, unpaid work 100 hours


       . May 2011 assault ABH, unpaid work 100 hours


       . May 2011 failing to provide a  specimen  of  breath  for  analysis,
         fined


       . 21 June 2016 - 5 counts of fraudulent evasion of duty,  12  months'
         imprisonment this being the sentence which prompted  the  Secretary
         of State to seek to deport the appellant, imposed  in  fact  on  21
         July 2016.


       . 25 November 2016, driving  with  excess  alcohol,  fined  �180  and
         disqualified.


14. The FtTJ noted at para 21 the content of an email  from  the  probation
    officer who supervised the appellant until  20  July  2017.  Ms  Lauren
    McDonagh emailed the appellant's solicitors on 2 January 2018  advising
    them:

         "I can confirm that I was  the  offender  manager  for  MM  between
         1/11/2016 and 20/7/2017. He was subject to  a  CJA-Std  Determinate
         Custody (12 months) for the offence of fraudulent evasion  of  duty
         (not drugs/weapons/ammunition) - Customs and Excise Management  Act
         1979-0023.


         I have not had contact with Mr M since 20/07/2017 and therefore  my
         summary of risk is valid only until this date. I  am  not  able  to
         summarise the risk he poses after the above date.


         Mr M was assessed as posing a Low  Risk  of  Serious  Harm  to  the
         public.


         Mr M's previous behaviour has demonstrated that he  is  capable  of
         causing harm to others. He has a conviction  for  violence  against
         the person but has not repeated this type of behaviour to date.  He
         is currently deemed to be a low risk of harm. Mr  M  complied  well
         with  the  terms  of  his  licence  and  did  not  demonstrate  any
         concerning behaviours in custody of  the  community  prior  to  the
         termination of his licence.


         Mr M's risk was not  considered  to  be  immediate.  Mr  M's  index
         offence did not cross the ROSH threshold. There has been no violent
         incidents for some years and Mr M has demonstrated the  ability  to
         control his alcohol misuse and violent behaviours."


15. At para 22 the FtTJ noted the sentencing remarks which  disclosed  some
    detail of the appellant's convictions for fraudulent evasion of duty to
    the extent of a loss of revenue of �140,000 and set out the  sentencing
    judge's view of the social harm involved.

16. In paras 23-29 various provisions and rules relating to asylum are  set
    out. Between paras 30 and 34 various parts of the EEA  Regulations  are
    set out and at para 35 there is reference to the case  of  Essa  [2012]
    EWCA Civ 1718 and the requirement to consider rehabilitation.  We  note
    that there is no challenge to the FtTJ's  treatment  of  the  issue  of
    rehabilitation.

17. Between paras 36 and 41 is a brief discussion of article  8.  Reference
    is made at para 39 to  section  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration  Act  2009  and  the  child's  welfare  being   a   primary
    consideration. The appellant's submissions are summarised at  paras  42
    to 48 and the Secretary of State's at 49-55.

18. The FtTJ's reasoning and decision are found at paras 56-67. In para  56
    the Polish sentence was  discussed;  at  para  57  the  evidence  about
    residence in the UK was assessed; at paras 57A-60 the appropriate  test
    was considered and the conclusion was reached in para 60  that  it  was
    met. At paras 61-66 article 8 private and  family  life  considerations
    were evaluated.

19. At para 67, the FtTJ concluded:

         "In summary therefore, I have found on the facts of his  case,  and
         on the balance of probabilities, that the decision  to  deport  the
         appellant as he is a high risk to public security in the UK  to  be
         correct. There are serious grounds of public  security  and  public
         policy to justify the decision that he is to be deported. I do  not
         consider that the fact that he is at risk  of  a  15  month  prison
         sentence in Poland, a safe country, to outweigh the public interest
         in deportation."

The appellant's five grounds of appeal against the FtT's determination

20. In ground of appeal 1 the appellant contends that the  FtTJ  failed  to
    deal with a claim advanced on the basis of article 3  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights to the effect that in light of the  previous
    extradition proceedings it would be inhuman or  degrading  to  serve  a
    sentence which the High Court had determined would be  oppressive.  The
    challenge was on article 3 grounds and not asylum and yet the FtTJ  had
    dealt with the claim as if it was an asylum claim and the issue is  put
    in this way in the ground of appeal:

         "The issue in the case was whether it was in the  circumstances  of
         the case, "humiliating and degrading" for the appellant to have  to
         serve the sentence of 15 months  imprisonment  and  if  so  whether
         requiring A to serve the sentence of 15 months could  be  justified
         on serious grounds of public  policy  and  security  or  imperative
         grounds of public security."

    Article 3 is said to have been a material aspect of the case such  that
    failure to deal with it was a material error of law.

21. The remaining grounds of appeal can be summarised more briefly:

       . In ground 2 the appellant contends that  the  FtTJ  went  behind  a
         concession made by the Secretary of State in  the  decision,  which
         was that the appellant had been resident in the UK in accordance to
         EEA Regulations for a period of 5 years continuously  from  January
         2007 to March 2012 by omitting from consideration the period from 1
         January to 31 March 2012.


       . In ground 3 the appellant contends that the judge erred  in  "going
         behind" a probation officer's risk assessment  that  the  appellant
         presented "low risk of serious harm to the public." In doing so the
         FtTJ had failed to adequately  reason  why,  by  his  conduct,  the
         appellant represented a genuine, present and  sufficiently  serious
         threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of  society.  She
         had erred in considering the issue of  proportionality  before  the
         issue of whether the appellant represented the requisite  level  of
         threat.


       . In ground 4 the appellant contends, somewhat indirectly,  that  the
         FtTJ erred in rejecting the oral evidence of the appellant and  his
         witnesses having stated at  para  7  that  he  found  them  broadly
         credible.


       . In ground 5 the appellant contends that the FtTJ erred  in  law  by
         failing to acknowledge the duty under section 55  of  the  Borders,
         Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 to consider and  identify  the
         best interests of the appellant's six year  old  daughter  who  was
         born in the UK and not Poland as the FtTJ had narrated.  The  child
         lives with the  appellant  and  his  partner  and  there  was  thus
         evidence of a genuine and subsisting relationship with a child.

Submissions for the appellant

22. On ground 1, Mr Berry argued that it had not been "safe" for the FtTJ
    to order deportation without first determining whether the appellant
    was still at risk of oppressive execution of the Polish sentence in
    relation to which the High Court had declined to extradite the
    appellant on the ground of oppression in 2013.

23. Whilst explicitly acknowledging that the point had been raised under
    article 3 of the ECHR before the FtTJ, Mr Berry submitted that the
    decision was "unsafe" given the obligations on the FtT under the Human
    Rights Act 1998. In this case the court ought to have considered the
    protections of not just article 3, but also article 5 and 6. Counsel
    had to accept that this last-mentioned submission was being made for
    the first time before us and he offered no authority or reasoning to
    demonstrate how the decision in separate extradition bearings should be
    considered to bear on this application for deportation made in light of
    the commission of wholly separate offending in the UK.

24. Mr Berry had nothing to say about ground 4 and on ground 2 only faintly
    proposed that if three months residence had erroneously  been  left  of
    account, it had some bearing on the question of integration so as to be
    of at least some consequence in any proportionality assessment.

25. On ground 3, he suggested that the FtTJ had no sufficient basis  to  go
    behind the  risk  assessment  of  the  appellant's  probation  officer.
    Further, the FtTJ had conflated the criterion  for  exclusion  and  the
    question of proportionality.  In MC (Essa principles  recast)  Portugal
    [2015] UKUT 520 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal had adapted previous  guidance
    in the light of the Court of Appeal decision in Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department v Dumliauskas  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  145.  The  proper
    approach, as the UT explained at para 29(b),  was  to  proceed  on  the
    basis that it is only if the personal conduct of the  person  concerned
    is found to represent  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society, in  terms
    of the 2006 EEA Regulations, that it  would  be  relevant  to  consider
    whether the decision is  proportionate  taking  into  account  all  the
    considerations identified in regulation 21(5)-(6).

26. On ground 5, Mr Berry submitted  that  there  was  a  failure  to  give
    discrete and  explicit  consideration  to  the  question  of  the  best
    interests of the appellant's 6  year  old  daughter  which,  given  the
    observations of Lady Hale in ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the
    Home Department [2011] UKSC 4, was a material error. Mr Berry confirmed
    that the child is not a British citizen and is not a  qualifying  child
    in terms of Exception  2  in  section  117C  (5)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.



Submissions for the Secretary of State

27. On ground 1, Mr Bramble adopted  his  note  under  Rule  24  where  the
    Secretary of State observed that the FtT had not  been  presented  with
    any objective evidence about the effect  of  the  appellant  serving  a
    prison sentence in Poland. There was  no  material  error  because  the
    claim under article 3 could not have succeeded and no  issue  had  ever
    been raised on grounds of article 5 or article 6. The  deportation  and
    extradition proceedings were wholly distinct.

28. On ground 2 he argued that it was not clear that  there  had  been  any
    departure from the Secretary of State's concession, but in  any  event,
    this could not be material. On ground 4, he observed  that  whilst  the
    witnesses were assessed to be broadly credible,  this  was  subject  to
    qualifications signposted in the first sentence in para  7  which  were
    later amplified and the reasoning was valid.

29. On ground 3 he submitted that on a proper analysis it  was  clear  that
    the FtTJ had approached her evaluation correctly and she  was  entitled
    to consider information about the appellant's further conviction  after
    being released from prison.

30. On ground 5 he observed that the position of the child was noted in the
    determination. The reality was that there was  no  further  information
    before the FtTJ beyond the bare fact of her living in the  same  family
    as the appellant. There was no basis to  conclude  that  a  failure  to
    state in terms that her best interests lay in staying with her  mother,
    wherever her mother may be, or that  they  lay  in  her  parents  being
    together, was a material error. The position  of  the  child  had  been
    considered in light of the immigration rules and the EEA Regulations.

Relevant law

31. Regulation 23 of the EEA Regulations 2016, provides in part:

         "23.- Exclusion and removal from the United Kingdom


         ...


         (6)  Subject to paragraphs (7) and (8), an  EEA  national  who  has
         entered the United Kingdom or the family member of such a  national
         who has entered the United Kingdom may be removed if-


             (b)  the Secretary of State  has  decided  that  the  person's
             removal is justified  on  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
             security or public health in accordance with regulation 27;"


32. Regulation 27, provides in part:

         "27.- Decisions taken on grounds of public policy, public  security
         and public health


         (1)  In  this  regulation,  a  "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
         decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public security  or
         public health.


         ...


         (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
         with a right of permanent residence under regulation 15  except  on
         serious grounds of public policy and public security.


         ...


         (5)  The public policy and  public  security  requirements  of  the
         United Kingdom include restricting rights  otherwise  conferred  by
         these Regulations in order to protect the fundamental interests  of
         society, and where a relevant  decision  is  taken  on  grounds  of
         public  policy  or  public  security  it  must  also  be  taken  in
         accordance with the following principles-


             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
             proportionality;


             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
             conduct of the person concerned;


             (c)  the personal conduct  of  the  person  must  represent  a
             genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one
             of the fundamental interests of society, taking  into  account
             past conduct of the person and that the threat does  not  need
             to be imminent;


             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
             which relate to considerations of general  prevention  do  not
             justify the decision;


             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
             themselves justify the decision;


             (f)  the decision may be taken on preventative  grounds,  even
             in the absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided the
             grounds are specific to the person.


         (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy and public security in relation to a  person  ("P")  who  is
         resident in the  United  Kingdom,  the  decision  maker  must  take
         account of considerations such as the age, state of health,  family
         and economic situation of P, P's length of residence in the  United
         Kingdom, P's  social  and  cultural  integration  into  the  United
         Kingdom and the extent of P's links with P's country of origin.


         ...


         (8)  A court or tribunal considering whether  the  requirements  of
         this regulation are met must (in particular)  have  regard  to  the
         considerations contained in Schedule 1  (considerations  of  public
         policy, public security and the fundamental  interests  of  society
         etc.).


33. Schedule 1 of the Regulations provides, in part:

         "1.  The EU Treaties do not impose a uniform scale of public policy
         or public security values: member States enjoy considerable
         discretion, acting within the parameters set by the EU Treaties,
         applied where relevant by the EEA agreement, to define their own
         standards of public policy and public security, for purposes
         tailored to their individual contexts, from time to time.


         2.   An EEA national or the family member of an EEA national having
         extensive familial and societal links with persons of the same
         nationality or language does not amount to integration in the
         United Kingdom; a significant degree of wider cultural and societal
         integration must be present before a person may be regarded as
         integrated in the United Kingdom.


         3.   Where an EEA national or the family member of an EEA national
         has received a custodial sentence, or is a persistent offender, the
         longer the sentence, or the more numerous the convictions, the
         greater the likelihood that the individual's continued presence in
         the United Kingdom represents a genuine, present and sufficiently
         serious threat affecting of the fundamental interests of society.


         4.   Little weight is to be attached to the integration of an EEA
         national or the family member of an EEA national within the United
         Kingdom if the alleged integrating links were formed at or around
         the same time as-


             (a)  the commission of a criminal offence; ...


         ...


         5.   The removal from the United Kingdom of an EEA national or the
         family member of an EEA national who is able to provide substantive
         evidence of not demonstrating a threat (for example, through
         demonstrating that the EEA national or the family member of an EEA
         national has successfully reformed or rehabilitated) is less likely
         to be proportionate.


         ...


         7.   For the purposes of these Regulations, the fundamental
         interests of society in the United Kingdom include-


             ...


             (b)  maintaining public order;


             (c)  preventing social harm;


             (d)  preventing the evasion of taxes and duties;


             (e)  protecting public services;


             (g)  tackling offences likely to cause harm to society where
             an immediate or direct victim may be difficult to identify but
             where there is wider societal harm (such as offences related
             to the misuse of drugs or crime with a cross-border dimension
             as mentioned in Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning
             of the European Union);


             (h)  combating the effects of persistent offending
             (particularly in relation to offences, which if taken in
             isolation, may otherwise be unlikely to meet the requirements
             of regulation 27); ...


             (j)  protecting the public;


             (k)  acting in the best interests of a child (including where
             doing so entails refusing a child admission to the United
             Kingdom, or otherwise taking an EEA decision against a child);
             ..."


34. It was accepted before the FtT that the appellant was a person  with  a
    right of permanent residence under Regulation 15 so that he  could  not
    be deported except on serious  grounds  of  public  policy  and  public
    security.

Analysis

Ground 1

35. Whilst Mr Berry proposed that the FtT was obliged to determine  whether
    the appellant would serve his sentence in Poland, we consider that  the
    FtTJ proceeded on the basis that the appellant may have  to  serve  his
    Polish sentence on return, but she also noted that the appellant  would
    be taking legal action to  avoid  doing  so.  The  judge  made  express
    reference to this at paragraph 66 based on the appellant's own evidence
    that he had engaged lawyers in Poland who were working within the legal
    system to resolve the issue. The outcome lies in the future and it  was
    not practicable for the FtT to ascertain with certainty what the future
    will hold and the FtTJ was entitled to proceed as she did.

36. On the article 3 point, Mr Bramble accepted that this was not an asylum
    claim and, to that extent, there was an error at paragraph 36.

37. However, as we have noted above, it has not been shown that  article  3
    featured in the grounds of appeal before the FtT. Reference to  article
    3 is certainly not to be found in the only grounds  of  appeal  in  our
    papers, which are in the appellant's bundle for the FtT  hearing  on  5
    April 2018 which was adjourned.

38. In his skeleton argument presented to the FtT the primary point made by
    counsel then instructed was that the appellant had been resident for 10
    years and could only be excluded on imperative grounds. He also  argued
    that the decision was not proportionate; the appellant did not meet the
    criterion  of  presenting  a  genuine   or   realistic   present   risk
    constituting a present threat to  the  requirements  of  public  policy
    affecting one of the fundamental interests  of  society;  he  had  been
    assessed as posing a low risk of serious harm to the public; and:

         "In the alternative the appellant contends that  his  removal  from
         the UK will breach his rights under articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR."

39. In his skeleton argument for the appeal in the Upper Tribunal, at  para
    10, Mr Berry confirmed that it was argued before the FtT that it  would
    be contrary to article 3 ECHR to deport the  appellant  to  Poland.  By
    para 12 of his skeleton this had grown to encompass articles  5  and  6
    but no argument  is  developed  there  and  no  further   argument  was
    developed before us, beyond a general assertion that  consideration  of
    articles 5 and 6 still awaited performance. Beyond  the  terms  of  the
    decision of the High Court there was no evidence before us and we  were
    offered no further assistance by way of submissions in this regard.  In
    these circumstances, we are not  able  to  find  that  deportation  for
    offences committed in the UK  in  2014  would  breach  the  appellant's
    rights under article 5 and/or 6.

40. We do not accept that the decision in  this  deportation  case  brought
    following  the  appellant's  conviction  in  the  UK  in  2015  somehow
    represents  an  abuse  of  process  in  relation  to  the   extradition
    proceedings, relating to an offence in Poland committed in 2004,  which
    were terminated by the High Court in 2013. The proceedings are  plainly
    distinct. In the proceedings before us the Secretary of  State  is  not
    seeking to revisit the failed extradition, the Secretary  of  State  is
    seeking to deport the appellant because of his offending in the UK.  In
    para  66  of  the  determination,  the  FtTJ  considered  whether   the
    possibility of having to serve the sentence in Poland might  amount  to
    very compelling reasons (per section 117C (6)  of  the  2002  Act)  and
    concluded that they did not.

41. The difficulty for the appellant is that there was  no  material  basis
    put before the FtT to demonstrate that serving a prison sentence,  even
    after oppressive delay, in Poland would meet  the  high  threshold  for
    contravention of article 3. Very properly, Mr Berry  conceded  that  he
    could not advance any material to support an assertion which  had  been
    made in para 8 of  the  grounds  of  appeal  (re  ground  1)  that  the
    appellant would be exposed to physical or psychological harm should  he
    require to serve his Polish prison sentence.

42. We consider that the error relating to an assessment of asylum  is  not
    material. The right result on the article 3 claim was  reached  by  the
    wrong route, but the result  could  not  have  been  different  on  the
    information before the FtT and before us. That is sufficient for us  to
    refuse ground of appeal 1.

43. Turning to ground 2 and the alleged omission of the first three  months
    of 2012, it is not clear that the concession  was  departed  from  but,
    even if it was, it could only mean that a period of 3 months  residence
    in the UK was left out of account. It could not have borne on the issue
    of whether the appellant had ten years residence in the  UK  which  was
    rejected for entirely different reasons and  it  was  accepted  by  the
    Secretary of State that he had five years residence in the UK.  Such  a
    short, possibly additional, interval of additional integration  in  the
    UK could  have  no  material  effect  on  the  FtT's  consideration  of
    proportionality

Ground 3

44. We recognise that in this case, where  the  appellant  had  acquired  a
    right  of  permanent  residence,  to  justify  interference  with   the
    appellant's rights as an EEA national to free movement the host  member
    state must find that his personal conduct represents a genuine, present
    and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  or  more   of   the
    fundamental interests of society and that the threat must be  justified
    to the appropriate standard  based  on  the  level  of  protection  the
    individual has acquired.

45. Dealing first with the complaint of going behind  a  social  work  risk
    assessment, we consider that as a matter of generality, even  if  there
    is a full risk assessment, a judge is not bound by it and can make  her
    own assessment based on all the evidence before her.  The  courts  have
    recognised that an OASys Report is a document  compiled  by  a  trained
    Probation Officer and cannot be lightly dismissed (see AM v SSHD [2012]
    EWCA Civ 163 and the decision of the Upper  Tribunal  in  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department v Vasconcelos [2013] UKUT 06378).  It  is
    open to the Tribunal to depart from the findings of such  a  report  if
    there is evidence upon which to do so.  The decision of Vasconcelos (as
    cited) makes it  plain  that  in  assessing  whether  an  EEA  national
    represents  a  current  threat  to  public  policy  by  the   risk   of
    reoffending, the Tribunal should consider the assessment  provided  but
    was not bound to it if the overall assessment of the evidence  supports
    a conclusion of a continued risk.

46. In this case there was no detailed OASys  risk  assessment  before  the
    FtTJ.  Rather, there was an email from  a  probation  officer,  in  the
    terms noted at para 12 above, who expressed the significant reservation
    that her  assessment  was  only  valid  to  July  2017.  Ms  McDonagh's
    assessment  substantially  related  to  the  risk  of   the   appellant
    committing further crimes of violence and she made no reference to  the
    appellant's conviction for drink-driving, an offence committed  shortly
    after his release from prison. It would be a pertinent consideration in
    assessing risk of reoffending of any kind. It was relevant to note that
    the appellant had set  up  a  new  business.  In  para  57A  there  are
    acceptable reasons for rejecting the proposition that the appellant did
    not meet the criterion of serious grounds of public  policy  or  public
    security on the basis of the probation officer's email  and  assessment
    of low risk. These include the significant fact of the appellant having
    created a new  business  following  the  same  model  as  his  previous
    business in the context of which he had committed the revenue offences.

47. Turning now to the submission that the assessment was not  carried  out
    as required by the Essa decisions, we consider that  the  determination
    should be examined in the round. We note  that  at  para  29  the  FtTJ
    correctly observed that under the 2016 Regulations, an EEA national who
    has a right to permanent residence in the UK may only  be  deported  on
    serious grounds of public policy or public security.  At  para  30  she
    noted that an EEA national who has resided in the UK in accordance with
    the EEA Regulations for a period of five  years  acquires  a  right  of
    residence. At para 31 she noted the terms of Regulation 23(6)  (b)  and
    at para 33 she set out the terms of Regulation 27 and Schedule 1.

48. Whilst in para 57A there may appear to be a  conflation  of  the  first
    step, assessing whether it had  been  established  he  was  a  genuine,
    present and sufficiently serious threat to the fundamental interest  of
    society (justified to the  appropriate  standard  (serious  grounds  of
    public policy or public security), and the subsequent step of assessing
    proportionality, analysing the determination as a whole and para 57A in
    particular, we do not consider that the FtTJ erred materially  in  this
    regard.

49. As we have noted above, the FtTJ had identified  the  correct  test  at
    para 29. Para 57A commences with the conclusion, based on  the  reasons
    given in para 57, that the imperative grounds test was  not  applicable
    and the appropriate level of protection was that of serious grounds  of
    public  policy  or  public  security.  Whilst  the  use  of  the   word
    proportionate in para 57A is unfortunate, we understand the FtTJ to  be
    deciding that for the crime committed by the appellant,  the  criterion
    of serious grounds of public policy or public security  could  be  met.
    The whole paragraph consists of an  analysis  of  the  gravity  of  the
    offence, consideration of risk and observations about  the  appellant's
    new business which was relevantly noted  in  the  context  of  risk  of
    further offending. The reference to his family  appears  there  in  the
    context of assessment of risk: they were not necessarily  an  effective
    protective factor against reoffending since they were part of his  life
    when he offended in the  first  place.  The  FtTJ's  reference  to  the
    appellant's overall record of convictions and associated sentences  was
    part of her examination of the risk of reoffending. In para 58 she went
    on to consider the issue of rehabilitation, noting also the possibility
    that he may have to serve his Polish prison sentence  before  the  FtTJ
    observes that the appellant says that he is seeking to challenge having
    to serve the sentence with the assistance of a lawyer. In para  59  the
    FtTJ considered the appellant's circumstances and those of  his  family
    generally noting many personal and business connections to Poland.

50.  The  FtTJ  firmly  concluded  at  para  60  that  the  respondent  had
    established that the  appellant  represented  a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat to the fundamental interests of society and
    that the appellant's conduct was serious so as to  justify  deportation
    on serious grounds of public  security,  particularly  to  prevent  the
    evasion of taxes and duties, noting also the danger which  he  presents
    when driving in light of his convictions. That appears to us to  be  an
    additional consideration, the primary conclusion being reached  on  the
    basis of the nature of the revenue offences committed by the  appellant
    in the context of all of the material considered in the course of paras
    57A and 58.

51. Article 8 family and private life issues were considered at paras 61-66
    through the lens of part 5 of the 2002 Act. In para 63 the  FtTJ  noted
    the age of the child and the implication that the appellant  could  not
    rely on Exception 2 within section 117C (5), albeit his reference is to
    para 399(a) of the Immigration Rules. The FtTJ recorded that the  child
    was Polish and, whilst it is correct that she was born in  the  UK,  it
    has not been contended that the FtTJ  erred  on  the  question  of  the
    child's  nationality.   She  observed  that  there  was   very   little
    information before her about the nature of any relationship between the
    appellant and his daughter, and there seems to have been  nothing  more
    than evidence confirming that they lived together in the same house  as
    a family.

52. Family life with the appellant's partner was considered at para 64  and
    it was noted that Exception 2 could  not  be  made  out  which  is  not
    challenged.

53. The appellant's private life was considered at para 65 and he could not
    come within the scope of Exception 1 in section 117C (4)  of  the  2002
    Act. At para 66 the criterion of very compelling reasons over and above
    the family and private life exceptions (section 117C(6)) was considered
    in  the context of the sentence of 15 months, but it was not  found  to
    be a very compelling circumstance  in  the  light  of  the  appellant's
    conduct in the UK.

54. The findings made by the judge included that both the appellant and his
    partner retained strong links to Poland; there was no evidence that his
    partner was settled in the UK (at [64]), she regularly  visited  Poland
    and had  family  living  there.  The  Judge  found  that  the  evidence
    demonstrated that he worked within the Polish community, his businesses
    have all been connected to Poland as  are  his  business  partners  (at
    [65]).

55. From our examination of the determination we are not persuaded that the
    FtTJ failed  to  consider  the  issues  of  meeting  the  criteria  for
    exclusion and proportionality separately.

56. Ground 4 - it is trite that a primary finder of  fact  is  entitled  to
    accept one part of the evidence of a witness even if rejecting  another
    part. That is what the FtTJ did and she offered reasons at para 7,  and
    at para 57 detailed  reasons  including  an  analysis  of  all  of  the
    available material alongside the witness evidence, for accepting  parts
    of what the appellant and his witnesses were  saying  whilst  rejecting
    other parts. For the foregoing reasons we reject this ground of  appeal
    on which Mr Berry did not present any oral submissions.

57. Ground 5 - we have already noted that at para 39 of  the  determination
    section 55 of the 2009 Act was referred to and the FtTJ  observed  that
    safeguarding the welfare of children is a  primary  but  not  paramount
    consideration.  We  have  summarised   in   paras   46-47   above   the
    consideration of article 8  which  included  recognition  of  a  family
    situation in which the appellant's 6 year old daughter lived  with  him
    in family. The FtTJ had section 55 in mind, and in her findings said as
    much as could have been said in  light  of  the  very  sparse  evidence
    before her. All that she could have added was that it was in  the  best
    interests of the child to reside with her mother and that it  would  be
    better for the child if her father lived with them also, but there  was
    no  more  information  before  the  FtTJ  about   the   father-daughter
    relationship. The appellant could not meet Exception 2 and, in the case
    of this family with extensive connections to Poland, merely to conclude
    that it would be in the child's best interests to reside with both  her
    father as well as her mother in England would not have had any material
    effect. We are not persuaded that there is any error  in  this  regard,
    and certainly no material error.

58. For all of these reasons we have reached the conclusion that it has not
    been demonstrated that there any material errors of law in the decision
    reached by the FtTJ and therefore the appeal is dismissed.
