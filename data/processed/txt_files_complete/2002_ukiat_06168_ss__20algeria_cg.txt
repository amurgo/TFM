                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The appellant was represented before us today by Mr G  Saunders,  Home
      Office Presenting Officer.  The respondent was represented by  Miss  S
      Sher of Counsel, instructed by Merza & Co.

2.    The respondent is a citizen of Algeria who claimed to have arrived  in
      the United Kingdom on 30 July 2001. At all events he claimed asylum on
      1 August 2001 and  was  subsequently  interviewed  on  behalf  of  the
      Secretary of State.    For the reasons  set  out  in  a  letter  dated
      13 September  2001  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  his   asylum
      application and on 14 September 2001  he  issued  directions  for  his
      removal to Algeria as an  illegal  entrant.  The  respondent  appealed
      against that decision on both asylum and human  rights  grounds.   His
      appeal was heard on 11 July 2002 by an Adjudicator Mr D G  Zucker  who
      allowed his appeal.  The Secretary of State now appeals with leave  to
      the Tribunal against that decision.

3.     The  respondent's  factual  claim,  which   was   accepted   by   the
      Adjudicator, is summarised  by  him  in  paragraphs  5  -  14  of  the
      determination.  Put shortly, the respondent was a member of  an  anti-
      terrorist group founded by the  Ministry  of  Defence  in  Algeria  to
      provide anti-terrorist support  to  the  Algerian  authorities.   This
      group is known as the Patriots. The respondent was second  in  command
      in his area and was responsible for the weapons and firearms  held  by
      the Patriots, and also for the organisation of ambushes on  groups  of
      terrorists which would, of course, have included members of the GIA.

4.    From April 1996 the respondent received a series  of  six  threatening
      letters from the GIA telling him that if he did not stop working as  a
      Patriot he would be killed.  As Patriots had special knowledge of  the
      areas where they worked removing him from his office would  have  been
      important for the  GIA.   He  did  not  wish  to  give  up  his  work,
      principally because he felt he would be at greater risk if he  was  no
      longer a member of the Patriots and entitled to the  protection  which
      that afforded him.  He reported the matter to  his  superior  and  was
      told that the gendarmerie would be informed but no  action  was  taken
      and the threats were not investigated.  The threats were renewed again
      in early 1997 and there had been an approach to  his  father  who  was
      informed that they had instructions to kill the appellant  if  he  did
      not cease his work.  The matter was again reported to the  police  but
      the persons concerned could not be identified and the  respondent  was
      told  to  be  vigilant  and  keep  the  police  informed  of  anything
      suspicious.  From that time on the respondent stayed at nights at  the
      Patriot base for his own safety.

5.    In June 2000 while sitting outside a cafï¿½ in Tessala there were  shots
      from a passing car, two of which injured his friend.   The  respondent
      was certain that the bullets were intended for him and this led to his
      decision finally to leave the Patriots and to leave  the  country  for
      his own safety.

6.    The Adjudicator, having accepted that evidence, found specifically  at
      paragraph 26 of his determination that the respondent,  by  virtue  of
      his rank and having been  specifically  targeted,  was  in  a  special
      position and entitled to  rather  more  protection  than  an  ordinary
      serving member of the Patriots. He accepted that there was  a  Refugee
      Convention reason, namely imputed political opinion, for the targeting
      of the respondent by the GIA.  At  paragraph  29  he  dealt  with  the
      situation as follows:

           "I have been particularly driven to the view that the  appellant
           should  succeed  by  the  fact  that  whilst  he  received  some
           protection as a member of the Patriots such  would  not  be  the
           same once he resigned.  The appellant did  resign.  He  told  me
           that before he left the country he handed in his  weapon  and  I
           accept that.  He could hardly then be expected to spend his days
           living in accommodation along with other Patriots with  whom  he
           did not work and without his own weapon, even if  they  were  to
           have allowed him to have done that, which I do not  accept  they
           would.  Still further, persons who work towards  protecting  the
           safety of others outside compulsory service should  be  able  to
           give up that work and  obtain  sufficient  protection  otherwise
           their work becomes a life sentence which is inhumane."


7.    The  Adjudicator  then  went  on  to  find  that  the  respondent  had
      established a well-founded  fear  of  persecution  under  the  Refugee
      Convention and that he would similarly be entitled  to  protection  by
      reason of breach of Article  3  of  the  European  Convention  by  his
      return.  He dealt with the issue of  internal  relocation,  which  had
      been raised before him, in the following terms at paragraph 33 of  his
      determination:-

           "Finally I shall make it plain unless it is not clear  from  the
           determination itself, that I do come to the view that  it  would
           be unduly harsh to have  this  appellant  live  anywhere  within
           Algeria given the fact that the GIA do have personnel in various
           parts of the country and the appellant would live in  consistent
           fear, at least because once he moved into another  part  of  the
           country a question would be asked about him [sic] and there is a
           reasonable likelihood, in his case that he would be identified".


8.    The Secretary of State appeals essentially  on  two  grounds.   First,
      that  the  Adjudicator  had  based  his  finding  that  there  was  no
      sufficient protection available to the respondent in  Algeria  on  one
      newspaper article in The Times on 6 July 2002 but  that  evidence  was
      not submitted until the hearing at which the Secretary  of  State  was
      not represented. He claims that he had no opportunity  to  comment  so
      that the Adjudicator showed unfair prejudice towards the respondent.

9.    We have considered the article in question at this  hearing.  It  does
      no more than report a terrorist atrocity where a bomb was set  off  by
      Islamic fundamentalists in a  market  near  Algiers  on  5  July  2002
      resulting in the deaths of 35 people and the wounding of  others.   We
      agree that it is not directly in point to the issues  in  this  appeal
      because there is no suggestion that this was a targeted attack such as
      the respondent claims to fear, but it simply demonstrates  that  there
      is still the possibility of activity by the GIA in Algeria,  and  also
      near main towns although it is  more  commonly  now  confined  to  the
      countryside.  Before us Mr Saunders did not seek to suggest that, if a
      particular claimant were being specifically targeted by  the  GIA,  he
      might not be at real risk in Algeria because  the  network  of  agents
      still exists there.

10.   The second ground of appeal was that the Adjudicator  failed  to  take
      into account in his findings that the respondent  had  done  precisely
      what the GIA were seeking; namely, he had ceased to have  any  further
      connection with the Patriots and on that basis, says the Secretary  of
      State, he is of no continued interest to the GIA and to find  that  he
      is is perverse - that is to say a view which no reasonable Adjudicator
      could reach on the facts as he found them.

11.   There is no doubt in our mind that there was an error of law  in  part
      of the approach of the Adjudicator in relation  to  his  views  as  to
      whether the respondent had a well-founded fear of  persecution  during
      the period that he was a serving member of the  Patriots,  that  is  a
      matter which is dealt with clearly in the Court of Appeal decision  in
      Fadli (Appeal No. C-2000-268) where the  Court  of  Appeal  held  that
      serving soldiers would have no basis of fear of persecution under  the
      Refugee  Convention  in  respect  of  the  hazards  which  necessarily
      accompanied their service in that  capacity.   The  judgments  however
      specifically left open the issue of what  would  be  the  position  of
      former soldiers on the basis  that  in  Fadli's  case  it  was  merely
      speculative.

12.    We  have  given  careful  consideration  to  the  way  in  which  the
      determination is framed, but are satisfied that although the error  of
      law which we have identified clearly exists, it had no effect upon the
      final basis of the Adjudicator's decision.  What he did  was  to  make
      certain  findings  of  fact  that  the  respondent  might  be   in   a
      particularly vulnerable position. Those findings are as applicable  to
      his situation after he ceased to be   a  member  of  the  Patriots  as
      during the time that he was.  His decision  that  there  was  a  well-
      founded fear of persecution is clearly based on the factual  situation
      that the  respondent  had  resigned  from  the  Patriots  and  it  was
      approached in that way at paragraph 29 of the determination.   We  are
      therefore left with the situation of whether because  the  Adjudicator
      did not specifically deal with the point raised in the  appeal  before
      us - that the respondent had done what was asked so that  there  would
      now be no further interest in him - his decision should be regarded as
      so flawed as to be unsustainable or perverse.  Against this,  it  must
      be accepted that it is clear that the Adjudicator was fully  cognisant
      of that point.  He specifically set  it  out  in  the  course  of  the
      determination.  We do not reach the view  that  his  failure  to  deal
      specifically with that point in his findings  is  fundamental  to  the
      general conclusions which he  makes  against  an  accepted  matrix  of
      facts, including that point, or that his decision is thereby  rendered
      perverse.  We are satisfied that it was a decision which was  open  to
      him on the evidence,  and  although  another  Adjudicator  might  have
      reached a different decision that is not a basis on which to say  that
      the Adjudicator's findings in this case are  unsustainable,  which  is
      the hurdle which must be cleared by the Secretary of State if he is to
      succeed in his appeal.

12.   So far as the first limb of the grounds  of  appeal  is  concerned  we
      would only add that it is quite clear from reading  the  determination
      of the Adjudicator that he did have regard to the CIPU  Report  placed
      before him, the Amnesty International Report for 2002,  the current US
      State Department Report and the Human Rights Watch Report in  reaching
      his  conclusions  as  to  the  country  situation.   We  are  entirely
      satisfied that the first ground of appeal is not made out.

13.   For the above reasons this appeal is dismissed.
