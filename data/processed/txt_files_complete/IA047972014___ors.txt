For the Appellants:    None
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. In my decision promulgated on 10 December 2014, I found the judge erred
    in his Article 8 assessment.  I set aside the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Judge, such decision to be remade by me.

 2. The appeal came back before me on 24 February 2015 but was adjourned to
    enable the appellants inter alia to file and serve  an  updated  bundle
    and skeleton argument dealing with the matters raised in Duncan  Lewis'
    letter to the Upper Tribunal of 20 February 2015 and  issues  regarding
    the leave status of the appellants raised before me.

 3. Prior to the hearing on 30 June 2015,  the  first  appellant  lodged  a
    bundle of documents which  he  asked  me  to  take  into  account.   In
    particular, he wanted to pursue issues regarding unfairness with regard
    to a dismissed appeal against the decision  of  Judge  Morris  in  2010
    permission to appeal having been refused by the First-tier Tribunal  in
    February 2011 and the Upper Tribunal in April 2011.

 4. The only appeal before me resulted from an application made  subsequent
    to April 2011. In such circumstances and bearing in mind what I have to
    say at [5] and [6] below, I do not accept that the first  appellant  is
    entitled to re-argue events  from  2010  with  regard  to  the  adverse
    decision of Judge Morris.

 5. I have considered the  circumstances  in  terms  of  Rule  17A  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  s.104A  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 6. On 12 March 2015, all the appellants were granted leave  to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom, valid until 12 September 2017.  I find  the  effect
    of that grant of leave is such that the  appellant's  appeal  shall  be
    treated as abandoned under s.104A.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is abandoned.  There is no appeal before the Upper Tribunal.

No anonymity direction is made.



Signed                              Date 3 July 2015


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Peart



FEE AWARD


The appeal is abandoned and therefore I have no jurisdiction to make  a  fee
award.
