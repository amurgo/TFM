Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr B Hawkin (counsel for Immigration Connection Ltd)

For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Aysun Arslan,  a  citizen  of  Turkey  born  20
       January 1989 against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  of  15
       August 2016, itself made  in  relation  to  her  appeal  against  the
       Respondent's decision of 23 April 2015  to  make  removal  directions
       against her under section 47 of the 2006 Act following the refusal of
       her application for indefinite leave to remain as the  family  member
       of a Turkish businessman.


    2. She arrived in the United Kingdom on 11  January  2014  to  join  her
       spouse, Ramazan  Arslan,  with  a  residence  permit  valid  from  18
       December 2013 until 8 December 2014; on the last day of that permit's
       validity she applied for indefinite leave to remain as the  dependent
       of  a  Turkish  businessman  exercising  rights  under  the   Turkish
       Association Agreement ("ECAA").


    3. Her application was refused because the Secretary of  State  was  not
       satisfied that she had lived in the United Kingdom for a period of at
       least two years. The refusal letter states that she was refused under
       paragraph 41 of HC510 outlining the business requirements  under  the
       1973 Immigration Rules, by  reference  to  the  requirements  of  the
       Business ECAA modernised guidance.


    4. Grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal argued that

      a) The Appellant satisfied the requirements of HC510 at paragraph 28
         which permitted an application to be made for the removal of time
         limits on a close relative's stay once the time limit had been
         removed for a person who had remained here for 4 years as a
         businessman at which point they would need no further permission
         to engage in any kind of business;
      b) The requirement for two years' cohabitation found in the
         modernised guidance had not been present in HC510 and accordingly
         represented an unlawful restriction that was inconsistent with the
         standstill clause that preserved the status quo expressed in the
         Rules as they were upon the United Kingdom joining the European
         Community in 1973;
      c) In any event a reconsideration of her case had been sought on 14
         January 2016 given that by then she had completed two years'
         residency, although it had been refused on 21 April 2016.


    5. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed  the  appeal,  on  the  basis  that
       paragraphs 37-41 of HC510  did  not  allow  for  an  application  for
       indefinite leave to remain. Paragraph 42 allowed for the  time  limit
       to be  removed  once  a  person  has  reached  pension  age  after  a
       qualifying period of residence, or due to  permanent  incapacity  for
       work/disability or being the family member of someone who  had  died.
       Accordingly the Appellant had sought a status not provided for within
       HC510 but only created by the modernised guidance, and these were not
       stricter  requirements  than  those  laid  out   HC510   but   rather
       represented an additional benefit that was not provided  for  in  the
       original Association Agreement. In any event the Appellant's earnings
       were insufficient to meet the minimum threshold set out in the Rules.




    6. The First-tier Tribunal  also  dismissed  the  Appellant's  arguments
       based on her private  and  family  life  established  in  the  United
       Kingdom but the representatives before me were  agreed  that  nothing
       turned on that aspect of the decision: the application and appeal had
       been pursued primarily on Association Agreement grounds.


    7. Grounds of appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  contended,  in  so  far  as
       material, that

      a) The decision of the First-tier Tribunal was so replete with errors
         as to be unsafe: in particular misnaming the Appellant's husband,
         referencing a lengthy passage from a witness statement relating to
         moving to a larger property to accommodate themselves and to her
         husband running a successful business allowing them to maintain
         themselves without recourse to public funds which was not found in
         the witness statements that they had provided to the First-tier
         Tribunal, and giving the wrong dates for the Appellant's entry to
         the United Kingdom, her son's date of birth, and the refusal
         letter;


      b) The First-tier Tribunal erred in law in applying the two-year
         requirement from the Modernised Guidance which did, contrary to
         its reasoning, amount to an additional requirement superimposed on
         those in force in 1973, and in so doing, overlooking paragraph 28
         of HC510 which made specific provision for removal of the time
         limit on a dependent of a businessman.


    8. Judge Colyer granted permission to appeal on 13 December 2016 for the
       reasons set out in the grounds.


    9. Before me the Appellant's husband indicated that he had been  granted
       residence permits for five years via three consecutive grants, before
       obtaining indefinite leave to remain. Subsequent  to  the  hearing  I
       received copies of stamps in his passport  which  appear  to  confirm
       that information  which  was  not  disputed  by  Mr  Tarlow  for  the
       Respondent.


   10. The representatives agreed that, if the Upper Tribunal  identified  a
       material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal,  it
       would be appropriate for the appeal to be finally determined  without
       any further hearing, as all relevant evidence had  already  been  put
       forward.

Findings and reasons

Error of law

   11. The first challenge is to the sustainability of  the  decision  below
       given the errors found therein. There are  indeed  egregious  factual
       mistakes on a scale  rarely  seen.  As  stated  by  Moses  LJ  in  ML
       (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 844 �10:


           "A series of material factual errors can constitute an error  of
           law. It is trite in not only the field of  judicial  review  but
           also statutory appeals and appeals by way of  case  stated  that
           factual errors, if they are significant to the  conclusion,  can
           constitute errors of law."


       Alongside him Stanley Burnton LJ stated: "If there is any doubt as to
       whether or not the incorrect fact in question  was  material  to  the
       conclusion, that doubt is to be resolved in favour of the  individual
       who complains of the error."


   12. I have considered whether the decision can be sustained on the  basis
       that, all else aside, the First-tier Tribunal appreciated that it had
       a Turkish national before it who potentially  qualified  for  further
       leave applying the 1973 Immigration Rules, but it seems to me that it
       would be wrong to do where the mistakes are on such  a  large  scale.
       Litigants are entitled to have confidence in the appeals system,  and
       there are too many errors in this decision for the reasonable  reader
       to think that the case was considered with the appropriate care.


   13. I accordingly find that  there  is  a  material  error  of  law  that
       undermines the reasoning of the First-tier Tribunal.


Remaking the decision

   14. As only limited further findings are required before  the  appeal  is
       finally determined, and the parties agreed  before  me  that  it  was
       appropriate to determine the matter without further hearing, I do  so
       forthwith without any continuation hearing.


   15. The effect of the "standstill" clause contained in Article 41 of  the
       Additional Protocol to the Turkish  Association  Agreement  with  the
       European Community (the "Ankara Agreement")  is  that  Member  States
       "shall  refrain  from  introducing   between   themselves   any   new
       restrictions on freedom of establishment and the freedom  to  provide
       services".  Thus the relevant Immigration  Rules  in  this  case  are
       those extant at the date  the  United  Kingdom  joined  the  European
       Economic Community (as it then was) in January 1973.   At  that  time
       the relevant rules were contained in HC 510 promulgated in 1972.

   16.  The  Upper  Tribunal  in  Baylan   (Turkish   ECAA   -   "identical"
       applications) Turkey [2012] UKUT 83 (IAC) explained at  [8]-[9]  that
       "The  aim of the Agreement is essentially economic: it is "to promote
       the continuous and  balanced  strengthening  of  trade  and  economic
       relations  between  the  Contracting  Parties,  which  includes,   in
       relation to the workforce, the progressive  securing  of  freedom  of
       movement for workers and the abolition of restrictions on freedom  of
       establishment and on freedom to provide  services,  with  a  view  to
       improving  the  standard  of  living  of  the  Turkish   people   and
       facilitating the accession of Turkey to  the  Community  at  a  later
       date" (Oguz (External relations)  [2011]  EUECJ  C-186/10,  14  April
       2011) (Advocate-General Kokott, para 4) as emphasised by the Tribunal
       in EK (Ankara  Agreement - 1972 Rules - construction)  Turkey  [2010]
       UKUT 425 (IAC at para 21), in 1973 "the Rules themselves were an open
       textured exercise in discretion in the round  having  regard  to  the
       general policy and particular factors identified; so was the practice
       in applying them".

   17. HC 510 contains the Rules as to the practice to be  followed  in  the
       administration of the Immigration Act  1971  for  regulating  control
       after entry. The relevant Rules are these:


           "4. The succeeding paragraphs set out the main categories of
           people who may be given leave to enter and who may seek
           variation of their leave, and the principles to be followed in
           dealing with their application, or initiating any variation of
           their leave. In deciding these matters account is to be taken of
           all relevant facts; the fact that the applicant satisfies the
           formal requirement of these rules to stay or further stay in the
           proposed capacity is not conclusive in his favour. It will for
           example be relevant whether the person observed the time limit
           and condition subject to which he was admitted; whether in the
           light of his character, conduct or associations it is
           undesirable to permit him to remain, whether he represents a
           danger to national security; or whether, if allowed to remain
           for the period for which he wishes to stay, he might not be
           returnable to another country.
           28. A person who is admitted in the first instance for a limited
           period, and who remains here for 4 years in approved employment
           or as a businessman or a self-employed person or a person of
           independent means may have the time limit on his stay removed
           unless there are grounds for maintaining it. Applications for
           removal of the time limit are to be considered in the light of
           all the relevant circumstances, including those set out in
           paragraph 4. Once the time limit is removed no further
           permission from the Home Office or Department for Employment is
           needed to engage in any type of business or employment.
           Application for variation of leave to enter with a view to
           settlement may also be received from people originally admitted
           as, for example, visitors; but permission is to be limited to
           close relatives of people already accepted for settlement.
           Particulars are set out in paragraphs 37-44 of the Rules for
           Control on Entry dated October 1972 (HC509).'"


   18. Although the decision appealed against post-dates 6 April 2015, it is
       expressly not one to which  the  new  "relevant"  provisions  of  the
       Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 have application; because
       the application was made other than on human rights grounds and prior
       to 6 April 2015.  The  Immigration  Act  2014  (Commencement  No.  4,
       Transitional and Saving Provisions and Amendment) Order 2015  inserts
       Article 9(1)(c)(iv) into Commencement  Order  No.  3  such  that  the
       "saved" provisions are preserved in relation to "a decision  made  on
       or after 6th April 2015 ... to refuse an application made before  6th
       April 2015 ... to vary a person's leave to enter or remain and  where
       the result of that decision is that the person has no leave to  enter
       or remain ... unless that decision is also a refusal  of  an  asylum,
       protection or human rights claim."


   19. AR3.2(d) of the Immigration Rules states that eligible decisions  for
       administrative review include:


           "A decision made on or after 6th April 2015  on  an  application
           for leave to remain made by a Turkish national or  their  family
           member pursuant to the UK's obligations under Article 41 of  the
           Additional  Protocol  to  the  European  Community   Association
           Agreement (ECAA) with Turkey, and under Article 6(1) of Decision
           1/80 of the Association Council established by that agreement."


   20.  The  implication  of  administrative  review  being  introduced  for
       decisions in Turkish ECAA claims after April 2015 is  that  they  are
       treated in line with other matters which are not  "deemed"  as  human
       rights claims under the  Rules,  doubtless  because  the  application
       primarily relies on free movement rights recognised by the  agreement
       between Turkey and the European Union  rather  than  on  private  and
       family life.


   21. Accordingly the Appellant is entitled to rely on  grounds  of  appeal
       including that the decision was not in accordance with the law or not
       in accordance with the Immigration Rules.


   22. The Appellant made an application for indefinite leave to remain.  By
       this time her husband had had the time limit  on  his  own  residence
       here removed. It seems to me that to all intents and  purposes,  this
       was an application for a removal of the time limit  in  circumstances
       where she wished her leave to be varied with a  view  to  settlement,
       being a close relative of a person already accepted  for  settlement.
       Section 3(1)(b) of the Immigration Act 1971 states that a person


           "may be given leave  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  (or,  when
           already there, leave to remain in the United Kingdom) either for
           a limited or for an indefinite period".


Section 33(1) of the 1971 Act addressing Interpretation provides:



           "(1) For purposes of this Act, except in so far as the context
           otherwise requires-

                 "limited leave" and "indefinite leave" means respectively
                 leave under this Act to enter or remain in the United
                 Kingdom which is, and one which is not, limited as to
                 duration;"




   23. Rule 6 of the Immigration Rules now in force sets out a definition of
       settlement, though not for indefinite leave to remain:


           "'settled  in  the  United  Kingdom'  means  that   the   person
           concerned:
           (a) is free from any restriction on the period for which he  may
           remain ...
           (b) is either:
                (i) ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom without having
                entered or remained in breach of the immigration laws;"


   24.  Accordingly  it  can  be  seen  that  the  essential  definition  of
       indefinite leave to remain in so far  as  the  statute  provides  one
       equates to leave without any  time  limit.   So  the  starting  point
       adopted by the Respondent and First-tier  Tribunal  in  this  appeal,
       that there was no provision for an application for  indefinite  leave
       to remain in 1973, is seen to be a false premise: in reality  removal
       of a time limit and the grant of indefinite leave are essentially one
       and the same. 7


   25. I find that the Appellant was refused  an  application  to  vary  her
       leave from a limited leave as the spouse of a Turkish businessman  to
       a person present without any limitation on  her  stay.  That  was  an
       application  countenanced  by  the  HC510.  Furthermore  it  was   an
       application that could be  considered  under  the  Respondent's  ECAA
       Guidance.


   26. Given that Rule 28 of HC510 provided for  that  which  the  Appellant
       sought, without any reference to a two year period, it  seems  to  me
       that  this  additional  requirement  represents   a   tightening   of
       conditions and is thus analogous to "legislation which  makes  family
       reunification more difficult", and is therefore an attempt to enforce
       "a new restriction" which is prohibited, see for example Genc  [2016]
       EUECJ C-561/14.

   27. As it is not suggested that the Appellant did not satisfy  any  other
       aspect of HC510, her appeal accordingly succeeds.

   28. In the alternative to that analysis, and were it to be the case  that
       the alteration in the requirements  expressed  by  the  Secretary  of
       State's Guidance is enforceable, then it must be recognised that  the
       situation has moved on with the passage of time and the Appellant has
       now cohabited with the Sponsor for two years.


   29. A change of circumstance such as a period of residence  achieved  via
       the passage of time running up to an appeal hearing may be taken into
       account under the "saved" provisions of section 85 of the Nationality
       Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  as  the  Tribunal  may  "consider
       evidence about any matter which ... [is] relevant to the substance of
       the decision, including evidence  which  concerns  a  matter  arising
       after the date of the decision."


   30. I accordingly find that the Appellant meets the requirements  of  the
       Immigration Rules as set out in  HC  510  and  in  the  Secretary  of
       State's present Guidance. In these circumstances I allow  the  appeal
       because  the  immigration  decision  appealed  against  is   not   in
       accordance with the law (in so far as it  departs  from  Home  Office
       guidance) and in any  event  dissonant  with  the  Immigration  Rules
       (which must be taken to include those in force in 1973).


Decision

   31. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside. The  appeal  to
       the Upper Tribunal is allowed outright.

Fee award

As I have allowed the appeal a fee of �140 having been paid, I have  decided
to make a full fee award given that the Respondent's decision to refuse  the
application was wrong in law.
