Representation:

For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is my remaking of a decision in the Appellant's appeal.

 2. By a previous decision of mine  promulgated  on  29  November  2017,  I
    concluded that the First-tier Tribunal had made material errors of  law
    and that the judge's decision should be set aside.   My  error  of  law
    decision is annexed, below.

 3. In summary, I concluded that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  erred  by
    failing to make a direction to the  Respondent  to  obtain  information
    from HMRC on the  Appellant's  ex-spouse.   The  core  issue  had  been
    whether the ex-spouse (the EEA national) had exercised Treaty rights in
    the United Kingdom for a continuous period between the marriage to  the
    Appellant in July 2003 and the termination of that marriage  in  August
    2008.

 4. Following my decision on error of law I directed that a case management
    hearing should take place before me.  This occurred on 5 February 2018.
     Unfortunately, at that stage the relevant information  from  HMRC  had
    not been obtained.  The matter was then set down for a resumed hearing.
     On 16 March 2018 the Respondent complied (at least in  part)  with  my
    direction and produced evidence from HMRC on the ex-spouse's employment
    history in the United Kingdom.  The evidence  consisted  of  a  witness
    statement from the relevant HMRC employee together with a table setting
    out the level of income and tax paid during the  tax  years  2003-2009.
    Whilst this information was served on the Upper Tribunal,  it  did  not
    find its way through to the Appellant.




The resumed hearing before me

 5. The Appellant attended in person (he has not been  legally  represented
    throughout these proceedings).  At  the  outset  I  provided  him  with
    copies of the HMRC evidence, outlined the general legal issues  in  his
    case, and the position of the Respondent in light of the new  evidence.



 6. That position, as confirmed in a covering e-mail from Mr Duffy (sent in
    with the HMRC documents in March 2018) is as follows.  In light of  the
    levels of earnings attributable to the ex-spouse, it  is  not  accepted
    that she was exercising Treaty rights as a worker during the tax  years
    2007/2008 and 2008/2009.  It is said that the levels of income were  so
    low that the work simply was not effective or genuine.

 7. I paused the proceedings and asked the Appellant to leave  the  hearing
    room, read and consider the HMRC evidence, and think about any comments
    that he would wish to make to me in due course.

 8. On resumption of the hearing the Appellant confirmed that he was  happy
    to proceed.  I then asked Mr Duffy to make  his  submissions  first  in
    order that the Appellant could make any notes he wished so that he  was
    as informed and prepared as possible about the case against him.

 9. Mr Duffy relied on the HMRC evidence and broadly accepted that the  ex-
    spouse's earnings in the tax years 2003-2006  indicated  that  she  had
    been engaged in effective and genuine work.  The total earnings for the
    tax  year  2003/2004  were  �5,889.00;  for  2004/2005  the  total  was
    �13,736.00; for 2005/2006 the total was �22,712.00 and  the  total  for
    2006/2007 was �7,780.00.  However, Mr Duffy submitted  that  there  had
    then been a dramatic fall in earnings.  For the tax year 2007/2008  the
    total was only �1,683.00.  For the final relevant tax year, that  being
    2008/2009, the total earnings were just �606.00.   Mr  Duffy  confirmed
    that there was no evidence of the ex-spouse  having  made  any  benefit
    claims.  He submitted that  for  whatever  reason,  the  ex-spouse  had
    ceased to be engaged in effective and genuine work from  2007  onwards.
    He submitted that her earnings showed that any work undertaken had been
    marginal and/or ancillary.

10. The Appellant told me that in  early  2008  his  ex-spouse  had  fallen
    pregnant.  Three weeks into the pregnancy she suffered  a  miscarriage.
    He indicated that she had been unwell after this and this had prevented
    her from working.  When he was asked about her work in  the  time  from
    April 2007 until she became pregnant and in the few months  leading  up
    to the divorce in August 2008, the Appellant  said  that  he  had  been
    financially supporting her.  He told me that she had  worked  "a  bit",
    but that was all.  He had no idea what she did after their divorce.

11. At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision.




My remake decision

Findings of primary facts

12. There is no dispute that the Appellant married his  ex-spouse  in  July
    2003 and that the marriage was terminated on 15 August  2008.   I  find
    this to be the case.  I find that divorce proceedings were initiated in
    approximately October or November 2007.  There was  never  any  dispute
    that the Appellant himself has been working for  many  years.   I  find
    this to be so.  I find that the HMRC evidence is  reliable.   There  is
    nothing to contradict it  either  by  way  of  alternative  documentary
    evidence or challenge by the Appellant himself.  I am willing to accept
    that his ex-spouse did  fall  pregnant  in  early  2008  and  that  she
    suffered a miscarriage some three weeks later.  It may well be the case
    that it took some time for her to recover, but there is no  documentary
    evidence to indicate that this continued for a significant  time.   The
    Appellant has provided no detail about any ongoing complications, and I
    find that there were none.  In all the circumstances I find that the ex-
    spouse was potentially able to  work  again  from  March  2008  at  the
    latest.

13. I find that the ex-spouse was working during the years  2003  to  early
    2007.



Conclusions

14. I now turn to my conclusions in this appeal.  The core  issue  here  is
    whether the Appellant's ex-spouse was exercising  Treaty  rights  as  a
    worker in the United Kingdom in the immediate run-up to the  initiation
    of divorce proceedings in late 2007. It is this point in time which  is
    relevant, and nor the date of the termination of the  marriage  itself,
    because of  the  very  recent  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Baigazieva [2018] EWCA Civ 1088.

15. In assessing the issue of her status as a worker I make  the  following
    self-directions.  First, the concept of being a worker is to be given a
    wide meaning.  Second, the fact that a person may work for a number  of
    employers, for short durations, or for low income, is not a  reason  to
    find against the existence of worker status.  Third, I have  regard  to
    the individual's circumstances as a  whole,  including  their  previous
    work history.  Fourth, part-time work is to be taken into  account.   I
    have also had regard  to  a  decision  of  the  Administrative  Appeals
    Chamber in DV [2017] UKUT 155 (AAC), in particular paragraphs 4 and  5.
    In essence, this simply summarises the approach I have just set out.

16. Having regard to the evidence as a whole and the points stated  in  the
    previous paragraph I regret to say that I conclude that the Appellant's
    ex-spouse was not exercising Treaty rights as a worker or in any  other
    capacity during the period from the spring of 2007 onwards. She was not
    exercising  Treaty  rights  as  at  the  initiation  of   the   divorce
    proceedings in October/November 2007 or as at the  termination  of  the
    marriage in August  2008.   My  reasons  for  this  conclusion  are  as
    follows.

17. I take into account the previous work record.  The ex-spouse had been a
    worker between 2003 and the beginning of 2007.  Whilst the earnings  in
    2003/2004 and  2006/2007  were  fairly  low  they  were  sufficient  to
    indicate genuine and effective employment.  However, for one reason  or
    another her circumstances changed in  the  tax  year  2007/2008.   Even
    taking into account the issue of the pregnancy, her  work  record,  and
    all other relevant factors, I conclude that the total earnings in  that
    whole tax year, being only �1,683.00, were so low as to be marginal  or
    ancillary.  During  this  period,  the  Appellant  was  supporting  her
    financially.  I conclude that his support was much more than  simply  a
    "top-up" to her own earnings.  In reality the Appellant's  contribution
    constituted  the  entirety  of  her  living  needs.  She  was  entirely
    dependent upon the Appellant's earnings. In respect  of  the  following
    tax year, 2008/2009 the earnings were even less, just �606.00.  This is
    consistent with a decision by the ex-spouse, for  whatever  reason,  to
    have stopped working the previous year and rely on the Appellant.

18. I have considered whether the ex-spouse somehow retained worker  status
    or became a jobseeker, but conclude that this was  not  the  case.  The
    evidence before me simply does not in any way show that  she  satisfied
    any of the potentially relevant provisions under Regulations 5 or 6.

19. In light of the  above,  the  ex-spouse  had  not  herself  acquired  a
    permanent right of  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom  prior  to  the
    initiation of the divorce proceedings, nor was she a  qualified  person
    as at that date.

20. It follows from this that the  Appellant  could  not  have  acquired  a
    permanent right of  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom  prior  to  the
    initiation of divorce proceedings.  It also follows that he did not, as
    at that point in time, retain  a  right  of  residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom by virtue of Regulation 10(5) of the EEA Regulations 2006.

21. In consequence, the Appellant has no right of residence in this country
    and his appeal must be dismissed.

Representation:

For the Appellant:     The Appellant in person
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

22. This is a challenge by the Appellant  to  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Myers (the judge), promulgated on 23 February  2017,  in
    which she dismissed the Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
    decision of 2 October 2016, refusing to issue a document  confirming  a
    right of permanent residence  pursuant  to  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

23. The Appellant's application to the Respondent, made on  6  April  2017,
    had  been  based  upon  a  retained  right  of  residence   under   the
    Regulations.  The Appellant had married a Dutch national in 2003.  That
    marriage was terminated on 15 August 2008.  The central issue taken  by
    the Respondent against the Appellant was that he had failed to  provide
    evidence that his ex-wife had been exercising Treaty rights as  at  the
    date of the termination of the marriage.




The judge's decision

24. The appeal  was  decided  without  an  oral  hearing  pursuant  to  the
    Appellant's request.  The judge considered the evidence before  her  on
    13 February 2017.  That evidence included a bundle from the  Respondent
    together with a statement  and  other  documentation  provided  by  the
    Appellant in  advance.   The  judge  notes  that  there  was  what  she
    described as a  dearth  of  information  on  file  in  respect  of  the
    Appellant's former spouse and whether she was exercising Treaty  rights
    as at the date of the divorce.  The judge acknowledges the  Appellant's
    attempts to have sought the employment history of his ex-wife from  the
    HMRC.  This request was declined on  the  basis  that  they  could  not
    disclose relevant information to a third party.  The  judge  notes  the
    decision of the Court of Appeal in Amos [2011] EWCA Civ 552.

25. The judge then notes that it is possible for an Appellant to apply  for
    a direction from the Tribunal requiring the Respondent  to  obtain  and
    then provide relevant information from HMRC.  The judge  observes  that
    no such application had been made by the Appellant (who at all material
    times  has  been  unrepresented).   In  light  of  the  absence  of  an
    application  for  a  direction,  the  judge  found   that   there   was
    insufficient evidence to show that the ex-spouse was exercising  Treaty
    rights on the date of the termination of the marriage.  The appeal  was
    duly dismissed.




Grounds of appeal and grant of permission

26. The grounds (drafted by the Appellant himself) assert that he had  done
    all he could to obtain relevant information, and  that  the  Respondent
    herself should have made efforts to  contact  the  HMRC.   In  granting
    permission on 6 September 2017  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Chapman
    (sitting as a Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal)  commented  that  the
    judge may have acted unreasonably in failing to make a direction of her
    own volition given the circumstances in this particular case.




The hearing before me

27. The Appellant attended the hearing.  I  explained  the  nature  of  the
    proceedings to him and ensured that both  he  and  Mr  Clarke  had  all
    relevant documents at the outset.  Mr Clarke confirmed  that  the  only
    live issue before the judge had been whether or not the  ex-spouse  was
    exercising Treaty rights as at the  date  of  the  termination  of  the
    marriage.  Mr Clarke suggested that the Respondent's guidance  on  what
    to do in cases such as at present amounted to a  discretionary  policy.
    He initially submitted that the Appellant had  failed  to  provide  any
    evidence which might have allowed the Respondent to have made enquiries
    with the HMRC.

28. However, during the course of argument it  was  pointed  out  that  the
    Appellant had listed  a  brief  summary  of  his  ex-wife's  employment
    history at page 47 of the application form.  Mr Clarke  suggested  that
    even if a direction had been issued by the Tribunal  it  may  not  have
    been complied with.  I indicated to Mr Clarke  that  in  my  experience
    sitting in the First-tier Tribunal, such directions were in fact  often
    complied with.

29. Mr Mensah relied upon his own grounds.




Decision on error of law

30. As I informed the  parties  at  the  hearing,  in  all  the  particular
    circumstances of this case I conclude that the judge  materially  erred
    in law by failing to make a direction to  the  Respondent  of  her  own
    volition, or alternatively that she failed to provide any reasons as to
    why she would not pursue that course.

31. It is clear to me that the Appellant had done  all  he  could  to  have
    sought relevant information from HMRC.  This much was  acknowledged  by
    the judge, and it is fully supported by correspondence to and from HMRC
    (on file).  It is also  clear  that  the  Appellant  had  notified  the
    Respondent as to his ex-wife's employment history, as best he could  in
    all the circumstances, by completing  the  boxes  at  page  47  of  the
    application form.  The Respondent had  not  made  any  effort  to  seek
    information from the HMRC.  When the matter came before  the  judge  it
    was clear that the Appellant was in effect asking for the Secretary  of
    State to obtain evidence  from  the  HMRC,  his  attempts  having  been
    rebuffed (for legitimate reasons).

32. Given this fact and that the Appellant  was  unrepresented  and  cannot
    necessarily be expected to have known  that  he  could  have  sought  a
    direction from the Tribunal (pursuant  to  Rule  5  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's Procedure Rules), as a matter of fairness in my view it  was
    incumbent upon the judge to have  either  issued  a  direction  to  the
    Respondent or at least considered the matter substantively and provided
    adequate reasons for a decision not to issue such a direction.  In  the
    event the judge simply stated  that  the  Appellant  had  not  made  an
    application for a direction and left it at that.  In the  circumstances
    of this case this was inadequate.

33. As to whether the error is material, without a response from HMRC it is
    of course impossible to say for sure whether any  information  provided
    would be favourable to the Appellant  or  not.   However,  there  is  a
    realistic prospect that information obtained would be favourable.   The
    error is material.

34. In light of the above I set aside the judge's decision.

Disposal

35. Mr Mensah and Mr Clarke were both agreed that in light of  my  decision
    on the error of law I could remake the decision myself.   Before  doing
    so it is in my view appropriate for me to issue a direction  which  the
    First-tier Tribunal should have, namely that  the  Respondent  use  her
    best endeavours to obtain the employment history of the Appellant's ex-
    wife from HMRC covering the period 2003 to  at  least  2009.   All  the
    relevant information relating to the ex-wife (which included full name,
    nationality and date of birth, but not her national  insurance  number)
    was provided to Mr Clarke at the hearing and there was no need  for  me
    to set it out here.  I will issue this direction  in  written  form  as
    well (see below).

36. In terms of a resumed hearing, Mr Clarke suggested, and I  agree,  that
    it would be most appropriate for this matter to be relisted for an oral
    case management hearing before me in due course.  At this  hearing  the
    appropriate final disposal of this appeal can be discussed. It  may  be
    that a further substantive  hearing  is  unnecessary.   That  will  all
    depend on what evidence comes to light.




Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of  law
and I set it aside.

Having done so, I adjourn the  appeal  for  it  to  be  listed  for  a  case
management hearing before me in due course.

No anonymity direction is made.
