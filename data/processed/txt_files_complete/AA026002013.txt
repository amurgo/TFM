                         NOTICE OF  ABANDONED APPEAL

1.           The appellant is a citizen of Iraq.

2.           He appealed against the decision of the  respondent  to  refuse
    to grant him as the asylum. His appeal was dismissed by  an  immigration
    judge but that decision was subsequently set aside on 15 July 2013 by  a
    deputy upper tribunal judge.

3.           On 14 August 2013 the tribunal received  information  from  the
    respondent that the appellant has voluntarily departed to Iraq.

4.           Accordingly the appeal  before  the  upper  tribunal  has  been
    abandoned by virtue of section 104 of the  Nationality  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002.

Appeal abandoned.



Mrs D Taylor

Upper Tribunal Judge
