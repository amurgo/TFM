Representation:
For the Appellant Sanade:    Mr A Adewoye of Sam Solicitors

and Co

For the Respondent:               Mr Walker Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


   1. Section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007 provides that where a person  is
      sentenced to imprisonment of 12 months or more, he  must  be  deported
      unless he falls within one of the statutory exceptions.

   2. Article 8 provides one such exception but there  is  no  justification
      for saying that it will only  be  in  exceptional  circumstances  that
      removal will violate the family's protected Article 8 rights  or  that
      the claim itself must be exceptional: the issue is whether  the  State
      can justify the interference as necessary, that is say a proportionate
      and fair balance in pursuit of a legitimate aim.

   3. The  more  serious  the  offending,  the  stronger  is  the  case  for
      deportation, but Parliament has not stated that every offence  serious
      enough to merit a penalty of twelve months or more imprisonment  makes
      interference with human rights proportionate.

   4.  ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4 considered in  what  circumstances
      it was permissible to remove or deport a non-citizen parent where  the
      effect would be that a child who is a citizen of  the  United  Kingdom
      would also have to leave.  The fact the children  are  British  was  a
      strong pointer to the fact  that  their  future  lies  in  the  United
      Kingdom.

   5. Case C-34/09 Ruiz Zambrano now makes it clear that where the child  or
      indeed the remaining spouse is  a  British  citizen  and  therefore  a
      citizen of the European Union, as  a  matter  of  EU  law  it  is  not
      possible to require the family as a unit to relocate  outside  of  the
      European Union or for the Secretary of State to submit that  it  would
      be reasonable for them to do so.

   6. Where in the context of Article 8 one parent ("the remaining  parent")
      of a British citizen child is also a British  citizen  (or  cannot  be
      removed as a family member or in their own right), the removal of  the
      other parent does not mean that either  the  child  or  the  remaining
      parent will be required to  leave,  thereby  infringing  the  Zambrano
      principle, see C-256/11 Murat Dereci. The critical question is whether
      the child is dependent on the parent being removed for the exercise of
      his Union right of residence and whether removal of that  parent  will
      deprive the child of the effective exercise of residence in the United
      Kingdom or elsewhere in the Union.

   7.  Where  the  claimant's  conduct  is  persistent  and/or  serious  the
      interference with family life may be justified even  it  involves  the
      separation of the claimant from his  family  who  reasonably  wish  to
      continue living in the United Kingdom, Lee v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 348.



   8. The principles for evaluating Article 8 claims in criminal deportation
      cases are to be found in the Strasbourg  jurisprudence  of  Boultif  v
      Switzerland (no.54273/00) [2001] ECHR  479;  Uner  v  Netherlands  (no
      46410/99) [2006] ECHR 873 and Maslov v Austria  (no. 1638/03)   [2008]
      ECHR 546.

   9. In cases of the importation and supply of  significant  quantities  of
      Class A  drugs,  Strasbourg  has  recognised  why  states  show  great
      severity to such foreign offenders but there is no  special  principle
      in cases of importation or supply of drugs.  Deportation  must  always
      be proportionate.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. Introduction

 1. This is a determination to which both members have contributed.   These
    three appeals were heard consecutively  on  7  July  2011.   They  each
    concern the father of a young child who is a British citizen where  the
    father resists deportation on human rights grounds.  They  were  listed
    together before a panel of the Upper Tribunal to consider the impact of
    the decision of the Supreme Court in ZH Tanzania [2011] UKSC  4  [2011]
    AC 166 and the decision of the Court of Justice of the  European  Union
    in Case C-34/09 Ruiz Zambrano [2011] ECR 1-0000 8 March 2011 (hereafter
    Zambrano).

 2. Directions  had  been  issued  asking  that  the  representatives  come
    prepared to examine these questions but in the event, Mr Walker for the
    respondent had not received sufficient instructions to  enable  him  to
    address the Zambrano question. We therefore afforded him a short period
    in which to make supplementary  submissions  in  writing  and  for  the
    appellant to respond to them. Unfortunately, the respondent was not  in
    a position to make such submissions until early October 2011 and  twice
    sought extensions of time to do  so.  We  reluctantly  agreed  to  this
    course, given the potential importance of the issue  and  the  need  to
    have  informed  representations  from  the  respondent.  When  a  short
    statement of policy was received, we posed a  number  of  supplementary
    questions to which, after a further extension of time, we  received  an
    answer on 24 November 2011. We issued directions for the appellants  to
    file any response that they wished to by the end of 5 December 2011.

 3. The reason for this last extension was by then we had become aware that
    the Court of Justice itself had considered the  scope  of  its  earlier
    ruling in Zambrano in the case of C-256/11 Murat Dereci  and  others  v
    Bundesministerum fur Inneres in a judgment  delivered  on  15  November
    2011. This case has clarified the relevance of Zambrano to the  present
    appeals. We have received and taken into account submissions  from  the
    appellant Harrison on the effect of this judgment.  We have  considered
    whether there was a need to reconvene a further  oral  hearing  and  we
    have concluded that there is no need to.

 4. We are now able to deliver  our  determination.  We  indicated  at  the
    hearing to the representatives that we were minded to issue a  combined
    determination with respect to  the  relevant  legal  principles  to  be
    considered. We propose to adopt this course, before  dealing  with  the
    merits of each individual appeal separately.

2.  Summary of the factual foundation of the appeals:

Sanade
 5. Mr and Mrs Sanade both originate from India. They were granted leave to
    enter or remain in the United Kingdom for employment as nurses  in  the
    National Health Service. They  met  here,  married  in  2005  and  were
    granted indefinite leave to remain in July 2009.

 6. They have two children born in the United Kingdom: in July 2007 and  in
    February 2010. The latter is a British citizen by birth. Mrs Sanade and
    the elder child have become British citizens by registration.

 7. On 24 June 2010 Mr Sanade was sentenced to twelve  months  imprisonment
    on his plea of guilty for an offence of indecent assault on  a  patient
    committed in  February  2010.  His  sentence  rendered  him  liable  to
    automatic deportation under the UK Borders Act 2007 s.  32(5).  He  was
    released on bail in  December  2010.  His  appeal  to  the  First  tier
    Tribunal was dismissed in February 2011.

Harrison
 8. Mr Harrison is a Jamaican national born in 1975. He first came  to  the
    United Kingdom in 1999 as a visitor and his leave was extended first as
    a student and then as a spouse of a woman he married in  October  2000.
    He was granted indefinite leave to remain on the basis of this marriage
    in January 2003.

 9. In November 2003 he was arrested and remanded in custody  charged  with
    an offence of conspiracy to supply a Class A drug, namely  cocaine.  He
    pleaded guilty to this offence on 23 June 2004 and an offence of  being
    in possession of a taser stun gun firearm.  On  23  July  2004  he  was
    sentenced on all matters by the Kingston Crown  Court  to  seven  years
    imprisonment and recommended for deportation. In June  2007  whilst  he
    was still serving his sentence he claimed asylum on the basis of  gang-
    based persecution in Jamaica.  This claim was rejected in November 2009
    and his appeal against this part of the decision was dismissed  without
    further challenge in November 2010.

10. Mr Harrison resisted deportation on the basis of his Article  8  family
    and private life. It is this aspect that is in  contention  before  us.
    His family life will be considered in greater detail below. At the time
    of these appeals he is the unmarried partner of a  British  citizen  by
    whom he has three British citizen children born in May 2002, March 2010
    and May 2011. He was released on bail in November 2007.

11. A panel of the First tier Tribunal dismissed his appeal in  June  2010.
    Permission to appeal against the panel's decision was  granted  on  the
    basis of an arguable misdirection as to  the  burden  and  standard  of
    proof in Article 8 cases. Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  Lewis  found  no
    material error of law when he heard the  appeal  on  9  November  2010.
    Grounds for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal were lodged  on
    24 November 2010. By the time they came to be considered by SIJ Perkins
    on 4 April 2011, the  Supreme  Court  had  given  its  decision  in  ZH
    (Tanzania). He accordingly reviewed Judge Lewis's decision on the basis
    of subsequent binding judicial decision that could have had  an  effect
    on the decision  pursuant to rule 45 (1) (b) of the Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. As a result he set aside the decision.

Walker
12. The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica who was born on 12 May  1971.  He
    entered the United Kingdom in December 1996 when he was  aged  25.  The
    appellant has four children now aged 20, 17, 13 and 4.

13. He met his present wife, Julie-Ann Smith, who  is  the  mother  of  his
    children, in Jamaica in  1989.   Julie-Ann's  mother  was  living  (and
    continues to live) in the United Kingdom.  The second child (X)  joined
    his grandmother in the United Kingdom in December 1996 when he was just
    2 years old leaving the rest of his  family  in  Jamaica.   The  eldest
    child (W) joined her grandmother and sibling X in 1997 when she  was  5
    or 6 and their mother, Julie-Ann, joined them in December 1997.

14. The appellant came to the United Kingdom at the same time as the second
    child in December 1996, now nearly some 15 years ago.  He entered as  a
    visitor but overstayed.  He continued his relationship  with  Julie-Ann
    but married another woman in May 1997 on the basis of which  he  sought
    indefinite leave to remain as a spouse.  The marriage took  place  four
    days before his leave expired.  On the strength of it he was  given  12
    months leave to remain expiring on 30 June 1998.   Enquiries,  however,
    revealed he was apparently living with Julie-Ann  and  his  application
    for further leave to remain  was  refused.   Immigration  Judge  Wright
    found at an earlier hearing that this marriage was one of  convenience.
    It was dissolved on 19 September 1999.   The two youngest children were
    born in the United Kingdom in December 1998 (Y) and June 2007 (Z).

15. The appellant married his wife on 29 March 2003 in the United  Kingdom.
    At that time, he had no leave to remain. On the strength of his  second
    marriage he applied for leave to remain as a spouse.   The  application
    was made on 17 May 2003 but it was not refused until 13 June 2007.

16. He had committed theft and kindred offences in 1998; in  possession  of
    cannabis in 2002 and having a  bladed  or  sharp-pointed  object  in  a
    public place in 2005. These matters were dealt with by way of  cautions
    or warnings.

17. On 10 December 2007 he was convicted of possessing Class A  drugs  with
    intent  to  supply  and  was  sentenced  to  a  term  of   five   years
    imprisonment. He became liable to automatic deportation under s.32  the
    UK Borders Act 2007 and was given notice to that effect on  9  November
    2008. On 23 November 2009, the Secretary of State  made  a  deportation
    order against him.

18. The appellant's appeal came before a panel of the AIT (Judge Jhirad and
    Mrs Cross de Chavannes) who dismissed his  appeal  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 8  February  2010.  Pursuant  to  leave  granted  on  26
    February 2010, his appeal came before Senior Immigration  Judge  Martin
    who found that the Tribunal's determination did not involve the  making
    of an error on a point of law. His renewed  application  for  leave  to
    appeal to the Court of  Appeal  came  before  Sir  Richard  Buxton  who
    granted permission to appeal,  when he said:

           "There is no evidence of significant contacts with Jamaica.  The
           reality is that if the mother decides to follow the applicant to
           Jamaica the two younger children, and possibly also X,  will  go
           with her. That would, for them, be a significant  disruption  of
           their private, if not their family, life. At least the spirit of
           Beoku-Betts indicates that the effect of the deportation on each
           family member should be considered separately. That may not have
           been fully done here.


           There are two further points. First, I have no  doubt  that  the
           Tribunals were entirely right in thinking  that  the  applicant,
           taken on his own, was an obvious candidate for  deportation.  It
           does not follow, however, that his deportation cannot be stayed,
           however unmeritoriously, because of its impact  on  his  family.
           Second, it is arguable that the Tribunal should have  considered
           the practical impact of the deportation decision on the right of
           abode of the children as British citizens. It is  one  thing  to
           say that an adult can decide whether or  not  to  exercise  that
           right when her spouse is deported;  perhaps  another  to  assume
           that a child must forfeit that right as a  result  of  a  family
           decision following from a deportation order."


19. In the statement of reasons provided to the Court of  Appeal  following
    the grant of permission, the Secretary of State  agreed  that,  in  the
    particular factual circumstances of the  case,  there  was  a  material
    error of law requiring the Upper Tribunal to consider the  comments  of
    Sir Richard Buxton. The appeal was subsequently allowed by  consent  by
    Sullivan LJ to enable the Tribunal to give further consideration to the
    Article 8 claim.

20. Mr Walker was released on licence on 6 July 2010  and  will  remain  on
    licence until December  2012,  maintaining  monthly  contact  with  his
    supervising officer in the meantime.

21. Both his wife and his children are now British citizens.   Certificates
    of registration as British citizens under the British  Nationality  Act
    1981 were issued in July 2009. There is evidence that some or  all  had
    previously been granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The appellant's mother is resident in the United Kingdom  and
    is a British citizen.  The appellant also has a sister  in  the  United
    Kingdom. She, too, is a British citizen.  His wife's mother lives  with
    the family.

3. Error of Law

22. In summary, therefore, each appellant is married to a woman  who  is  a
    British citizen. They each have minor children who are British citizens
    who were either born here or have lived here from an early age.

23. Mr Sanade lives in a household with  his  wife  and  children  and  was
    granted indefinite leave as a  spouse  before  his  offending  put  his
    immigration status in jeopardy.

24. Mr Harrison had indefinite leave to remain on the basis of marriage  to
    someone other than his present partner. The First tier  Tribunal  found
    that this leave was obtained by misrepresentation as to the  nature  of
    the relationship as he was in  a  pre-existing  relationship  with  his
    present partner. The deportation order cancels all  existing  leave  to
    remain granted to Mr Sanade and Mr Harrison.

25. Mr Walker obtained previous leave to remain as a spouse by virtue of  a
    marriage of convenience. He had  no  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom at the time  of  his  marriage  to  his  present  wife  or  the
    deportation decision.

26. In Mr Walker's case it has been accepted before  the  Court  of  Appeal
    that there was an error of law by reason of the failure of the Tribunal
    to examine the interests of the British national children as a  primary
    consideration the light of the guidance in ZH (Tanzania).

27. We conclude that there are similar errors in  both  of  the  other  two
    cases. In each case we will set aside and re-make the decision  in  the
    light of the findings of primary fact below and the application of  the
    principles that we set out in the next section of this determination.

28. We will give further consideration to the  offending  and  the  judge's
    sentencing remarks when we consider each individual case below as  well
    as other factors urged upon  as  relevant  to  the  Article  8  balance
    between the interest of the family  members  and  the  public  interest
    favouring deportation. Before we do so  we  will  first  consider  some
    generic issues that arise in these appeals.

4. Automatic deportation:

29. Section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007 applies to  all  those  who  have
    received a sentence of imprisonment of  at  least  12  months  after  1
    August 2008 or is in custody pursuant to such a sentence on  that  date
    and had not been served with a notice of deportation before then.  Such
    a person is defined as a foreign criminal and must be made the  subject
    of a deportation order unless an exception  applies  under  s.33.   The
    three most common exceptions are:


           Exception 1: removal would breach a person's  Convention  rights
           within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998 or  the  Refugee
           Convention 1951 (s.33(2)).
           Exception 2: the person is under 18 (s.33((3)).
           Exception 3: removal would breach  the  rights  of  the  foreign
           criminal under the Community Treaties (s.33(4)).


30. Mr Sanade and Mr Harrison come within the automatic deportation  regime
    and rely on the Article 8 ECHR rights to respect for private and family
    life pursuant to the Schedule 1 to  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998.   Mr
    Walker's deportation order was made before  the  automatic  deportation
    provisions came into force. He appeals against the  refusal  to  revoke
    that order by s.82(2)(k) the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002. He has an in-country right of appeal under s.94(1) because he has
    made a human rights  claim  of  a  similar  nature  to  the  other  two
    appellants.

31. The 2007 Act means that a person who has  received  a  sentence  of  at
    least twelve months for an offence is a  person  whose  deportation  is
    considered conducive to the public good within the meaning of s.3(5)(a)
    of the Immigration Act 1971 and is so considered even if  an  exception
    applies: see s.33(7).

32. In July 2011 the Secretary of  State  issued  a  consultation  document
    called Family Migration.  In  section 8 of that document  the following
    appears:-

           "8.11 As a starting point for discussion we suggest that,  as  a
           general rule, where a person is convicted  of  an  offence  that
           meets the automatic deportation threshold - where Parliament has
           imposed a duty on the Secretary of State to make  a  deportation
           order - then  it  is  reasonable  to  presume  that  the  public
           interest will warrant deportation and that only  in  exceptional
           circumstances will it be a breach of the right  to  respect  for
           private and family life to remove the person from the UK.


           8.12 We note that the courts in England and Wales have indicated
           that this is the right  approach.  In  AP  (Trinidad  &  Tobago)
           [2011] EWCA Civ 551,120 the Court of Appeal commented that where
           the automatic deportation criteria  are  met,  it  is  at  least
           arguable that the court should give greater weight to the public
           interest in deportation proceeding and it is likely to  be  rare
           that the public interest would be outweighed by Article 8."
            (our emphasis)

33. Although we have received  no  submissions  to  this  effect  from  the
    Secretary of State in these appeals,  we  have  examined  whether  this
    proposition is accurate and should be applied by us.  We  have  reached
    the conclusion it should not for three reasons: i) the  general  scheme
    of the provision; ii) consideration of the relevance of a twelve  month
    sentence to the  other  related  exceptions;  iii)  previous  authority
    binding on us.

34. A person sentenced to 12 months or more  must  be  deported  unless  he
    falls within the exceptions. It can therefore be said  that  Article  8
    provides an exception to  the  presumption  that  deportation  will  be
    automatic. The Secretary of State's consultation document puts a  gloss
    on this by saying that where the twelve month threshold is passed  only
    in exceptional circumstances will deportation be a breach of the  right
    to respect for private and family life. This is not  what  the  statute
    says; it nowhere suggests that the  Article  8  claim  must  itself  be
    exceptional. Indeed it is difficult to see how  it  could  do  so.  The
    exception is necessary to comply with the obligation of domestic law to
    ensure the Secretary of State acts compatibly with the duty to  respect
    the claimant's  Article  8  rights,  reflecting  the  United  Kingdom's
    international obligations.

35. The  task  in  Article  8  assessments  is  whether  interference  with
    established family or private life that is to be respected is necessary
    and proportionate, that is, strikes a right balance. If the factors  in
    the balance are weighted by an  ill-defined  exceptionality  test,  the
    process ceases to reflect the task to be performed  under  the  settled
    jurisprudence of  the  Strasbourg  Courts  as  applied  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

36. We now turn to the Refugee and European Union exceptions  to  automatic
    deportation. In neither case could there  be  a  presumption  that  the
    exception will not generally apply in the case of a sentence of  twelve
    months or more. A refugee is entitled to the protection of  Article  33
    of the Refugee Convention and is not subject to the application of  the
    exclusions clauses unless convicted of a serious (non-political)  crime
    or guilty of similar conduct. Section 72 of the Nationality Immigration
    and Asylum Act applies a rebuttable presumption that this is  the  case
    where a person  has  been  sentenced  to  two  years  imprisonment.  In
    European Union law deportation cannot be based on the  existence  of  a
    criminal conviction alone and it must be demonstrated that  the  person
    represents a personal threat to public policy before his or her  rights
    of residence under Community  law  can  be  interfered  with  (see  the
    principles now  set  out  in  Part  VI  of  EP  and  Council  Directive
    2004/38/EC (the Citizens Directive).  Indeed  there  is  no  scope  for
    automatic deportation at all:  see C-348/96 Calfa [1999] ECR 1-11; each
    case requires assessment of the circumstances to see whether the person
    is a threat C-145/09 Tsakouridis [2011] ECR 1-0000.

37. We now turn to the case law. Exceptionality  has  been  authoritatively
    held not to be the applicable  principle  in  the  related  context  of
    reliance on Article 8 in removal cases where  a  person  is  unable  to
    comply with the provisions of the Immigration Rules:   see Huang v SSHD
    [2007] UKHL 11 [2007] 2 AC 167 per  Lord  Bingham  at  [20].   Wherever
    removal would amount to an interference with  private  or  family  life
    that ought to be respected, the judge must decide  whether  removal  is
    justified as a proportionate response to a legitimate aim identified in
    Article 8(2) of the ECHR.  We conclude that there is no  greater  scope
    for exceptionality as a relevant principle in deportation cases than in
    removal cases.

38.  It  is  indeed  conceptually  difficult  to  apply  an  exceptionality
    principle  in  either  removal   or   deportation   cases   where   the
    circumstances of the claimant and the family members may  be  many  and
    varied as to  nationality  and  immigration  status,  circumstances  of
    entry, length of residence, existence or age  of  children,  degree  of
    criminality revealed in the sentencing remarks of the judge  and  other
    relevant factors. Instead the learning of both the Strasbourg court and
    the courts of the United Kingdom reveal that attention should be  given
    to factors of particular  weight,  including  the  seriousness  of  the
    offending, in the  balance  to  be  performed  in  the  proportionality
    exercise.

39. In AP (Trinidad) [2011] EWCA Civ 551 the Court of Appeal was  concerned
    with a foreign criminal who was subject to automatic deportation having
    been sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for a drugs offence.  A  panel
    of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal  had  allowed  his  appeal,
    reconsideration was ordered on the basis  that  sufficient  weight  had
    been given to the public interests in deportation as  set  out  in  the
    authorities of N (Kenya) [2004] EWCA Civ 1094 [2004] INLR 612  and   OH
    (Serbia) [2008] EWCA Civ 1094 [2009] INLR  109.  The  Court  of  Appeal
    concluded that reconsideration should not  have  been  ordered  as  the
    first panel had not misdirected itself and had reached  a  decision  it
    was entitled to reach without misdirection. Concurring in  the  result,
    Carnwath LJ noted the decision  of  Sedley  LJ  sitting  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal in SSHD v BK [2010] UKUT 328 as to the potential effect of the
    legislative changes made by s.32 the UK Borders Act 2007.

40. What Sedley LJ said both in that case and another case SSHD v MK [2010]
    UKUT 281 IAC heard in the Upper Tribunal at about  the  same  time  was
    that under the previous regime it was for the  Secretary  of  State  to
    establish that the immigrant had conducted him or herself in such a way
    as to make deportation conducive to the public good and in that context
    regard should be had to the Secretary of State's policy in  maintaining
    respect for the law by  seeking  the  deportation  of  serious  foreign
    criminals such as the offenders in N (Kenya) and  OH  (Serbia).   Under
    the automatic deportation regime this stage in  the  process  has  been
    made the subject of a statutory assumption that it  is  in  the  public
    interest to deport a foreign offender subject to the application of the
    exemptions. Accordingly there is less room for  giving  weight  to  the
    Secretary of State's policy and it is the court's own assessment of the
    competing claims of respect to family life and the public  interest  in
    deportation that counts. A twelve month sentence will be  a  sufficient
    basis for deportation unless the exception applies.

41. Nowhere in BK or MK did  Sedley  LJ  indicate  that  in  assessing  the
    application of the human rights exemption to automatic deportation  the
    court  should  also  assume  that  deportation  was   a   proportionate
    interference with family life by reason of  such  a  sentence  save  in
    exceptional cases. Nor did Carnwath LJ in his  concurring  observations
    in AP Trinidad suggest this was the case.  Rather in each of the  three
    cases under consideration the judges concluded  that  the  AIT  or  the
    First tier Tribunal was entitled to allow  the  appellant's  appeal  in
    automatic deportation appeals where sentences considerably longer  than
    12 months had been passed, because of the degree of  interference  with
    private and/or family life was not justified and disproportionate.

42. In RU Bangladesh  [2011]  EWCA  Civ  651,  the  Court  of  Appeal  drew
    attention to the previous case law that has recognised that  Parliament
    has decided that in  a  case  of  a  sentence  of  12  months  or  more
    deportation will be automatic unless a human right or  other  exception
    applies[1].

43. In each of the appeals, we recognise that deportation will  be  in  the
    public interest and should result unless an  evaluation  of  the  human
    rights claim prevents it.  In automatic deportation cases if there  are
    no human rights claims that can be seriously advanced, deportation will
    follow. This may be why the threshold for deportation is  comparatively
    low.  Where there is family or private life that  should  be  respected
    but is being interfered  with  by  immigration  action,  the  issue  is
    whether the State can justify the interference as  necessary,  that  is
    say a proportionate and fair balance in pursuit of a legitimate aim.

5. The  Article 8 assessment

44. Under Article 8  the legitimate aim to be promoted by deportation  will
    be one or more of the following:


      national security, pubic safety, or the economic  well  being  of  the
      country, for the prevention or disorder or crime, for  the  protection
      of health and morals or for the protection of the rights and  freedoms
      of others.


45. Where (as in these cases) past criminal conduct is  the  basis  of  the
    decision, the legitimate aim is normally the prevention of disorder  or
    crime. Where a person poses a particular risk to the safety of  others,
    the protection of the health  or  rights  of  others  may  also  be  of
    importance. If in addition the offender has no right or  permission  to
    be here in the first place, the economic well being of the country  may
    well be engaged, as  immigration  control  is  a  recognised  means  to
    promote this aim.


46. Where family life is created at a time when the persons  involved  were
    aware that the immigration status of one of  them  was  such  that  the
    persistence of that family life within the host State  would  from  the
    outset be precarious that can be a strong  factor  in  the  balance  in
    favour of removal.  This proposition can  apply  to  relations  between
    adult partners or spouses, but not to the separate interest of children
    for reasons we consider below.

47. Further those who have entered irregularly,  and  have  used  fraud  to
    enter or remain undermine the integrity of immigration control and that
    of itself is a weighty reason to justify expulsion. Thus the Strasbourg
    Court has said recently in the case of Nunez v  Norway  (no.  55597/09)
    [2011] ECHR 1047 (28 June 2011) at [70]  to [71]:

           If serious or repeated violations of the immigration law were to
           be met with impunity, it would undermine  the  public's  respect
           for that law. Since an application for a residence permit  would
           be rejected in the event of failure to meet the  conditions  for
           residence, a refusal of such an application would not in  itself
           constitute a sanction for the provision  of  false  information.
           Therefore, the possibility for the  authorities  to  react  with
           expulsion  would  constitute  an  important  means  of   general
           deterrence  against  gross  or  repeated   violations   of   the
           Immigration Act.

48. It is long established that the legitimate aim  of  the  prevention  of
    disorder or crime does not depend on a person who has been convicted of
    a particularly serious offence being likely  to  further  threaten  the
    public interest by re-offending. As  the  decisions  of  the  Court  of
    Appeal in N (Kenya) and OH (Serbia)  demonstrate,  the  maintenance  of
    respect for the law, public indignation at past conduct, the deterrence
    of others by the adoption of the supplementary measure  of  deportation
    in addition  to  the  criminal  sentence  may  all  contribute  to  the
    legitimate aim and justify deportation providing  the  interference  is
    proportionate in all the circumstances of the case.  The  more  serious
    the  offending,  the  stronger  is   the  case  for  deportation,   but
    Parliament has not stated that every offence serious enough to merit  a
    custodial penalty or a penalty of twelve months or  more  imprisonment,
    for that reason makes interference with human rights proportionate.

49. Depending on the circumstances and particularly  where  the  claimant's
    conduct is persistent and/or very serious the interference with  family
    life may be justified even it involves the separation of  the  claimant
    from his family who reasonably wish to continue living  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  In Lee v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 348 the  Court  of  Appeal  was
    dealing with an appellant, 32 years  old,  who  initially  entered  the
    United Kingdom as a visitor in 1996 but  was  granted  a  variation  to
    enable him to remain as a student. When this leave expired at  the  end
    of October 1999 he overstayed, but at some point  thereafter  left  the
    country, returning in April 2002 and absconded after securing temporary
    admission. He was however arrested within three  months  for  having  a
    forged insurance certificate. In January 2003, having been  removed  to
    Jamaica, he re-entered the United  Kingdom  on  a  false  passport  and
    within a few months had again been arrested, this time  for  possession
    of Class A drugs with intent to supply.  On  pleas  of  guilty  to  ten
    counts he was sentenced on 3 October 2003 to 7 years' imprisonment. The
    Secretary of State had taken the view that it was reasonable to  expect
    the appellant's wife and children to go and live with him  in  Jamaica.
    Having considered the evidence the Immigration Judge  rightly  rejected
    that.  The question was whether  it  was  proportionate  to  break  the
    family up. The Immigration Judge concluded that it was. Sedley LJ  said
    at [27]:
           The tragic consequence is that this family,  short-lived  as  it
           has been, will be broken up for ever because of the  appellant's
           bad behaviour. That is  what  deportation  does.  Sometimes  the
           balance between its justification and its consequences falls the
           other way,  but  whether  it  does  so  is  a  question  for  an
           Immigration Judge.
50. We shall return  to  this  case  later  in  this  determination  having
    considered the case of  ZH  (Tanzania).  We  shall  first  examine  the
    Strasbourg case law. We are obliged by s.2  the Human Rights  Act  1998
    to have regard to the case law of the ECHR and where the case law is  a
    settled line of authority approved  by  the  Grand  Chamber  we  should
    follow it.

51. There is now extensive case law exploring the developing application of
    Article 8 ECHR in cases of removal from a contracting state. This is an
    area of the law where the 'living instrument' principle has  been  hard
    at work since 1988, see for instance the observations of Lord Wilson in
    Quila  [2011] UKSC 45 at [42]-[43]

52. The core principles for evaluating  Article  8  claims  in  deportation
    cases are to be found in the judgment of the Grand Chamber in Boultif v
    Switzerland (no.54273/00) [2001] ECHR 479. In  this  case  an  Algerian
    married to a Swiss national had committed a series of offences  in  his
    years of residence,  culminating  in  an  offence  of  robbery  with  a
    firearm. The court concluded that the obstacles to the couple moving to
    Algeria were sufficiently severe to make  deportation  disproportionate
    to the legitimate aim of preventing crime and disorder.  There were  no
    children of the family and the claimant was  considered  to  have  been
    sufficiently rehabilitated by his punishment as not to pose  a  current
    threat of re-offending.

53. The Court set out a list of factors to be considered.  Boultif criteria
    have been adopted and augmented in subsequent judgments in  this  field
    including  the decisions of  the Grand Chamber in  Uner  v  Netherlands
    (no. 46410/99) [2006] ECHR 873 and  Maslov  v  Austria   (no.  1638/03)
    [2008] ECHR 546. We have set out the relevant passage in Maslov in  the
    Appendix as judges making decisions in either Immigration Chamber  must
    be familiar with this decision.

54. Strasbourg has recognised that a propensity to re-offend is not  always
    required  to  make  deportation  proportionate  in  the  interests   of
    prevention of crime.  In Maslov the Court stated at [70]:-

           The Court would stress that while the criteria which emerge from
           its case-law and  are  spelled  out  in  the  Boultif  and  �ner
           judgments are meant to facilitate the application of  Article  8
           in expulsion cases by domestic courts, the weight to be attached
           to the respective criteria will inevitably vary according to the
           specific circumstances of each case.  Moreover,  it  has  to  be
           borne  in  mind  that  where,  as  in  the  present  case,   the
           interference  with  the  applicant's  rights  under  Article   8
           pursues, as a legitimate aim, the  "prevention  of  disorder  or
           crime" (see paragraph 67 above), the above  criteria  ultimately
           are designed to help evaluate the extent to which the  applicant
           can be expected to cause  disorder  or  to  engage  in  criminal
           activities.  (our emphasis)


55.   In cases of the importation and supply of  significant  quantities  of
    Class A drugs, in particular, Strasbourg has recognised why states show
    great severity to such foreign offenders. This has long been the policy
    of the Secretary of State and recognised as such by the UK Courts:  see
    Samaroo v SSHD [2001] EWCA Civ 1139  [2002]  INLR  55  (albeit  decided
    before the decision in Boultif was published).  There is,  however,  no
    special principle in cases of importation or supply of drugs.  Although
    the Court understands national authorities show great firmness to those
    who actively contribute to this scourge and the case for deterrence  of
    others  by  deportation,  such  action  may  be  disproportionate.   In
    Amrollahi v Denmark [2002] ECHR 522 an Iranian man married to a  Danish
    wife had committed an offence of trafficking 450 grams  of  heroin  one
    week after his marriage.  In the light of  the  family's  circumstances
    the family could not be expected to follow the claimant to Iran.  As  a
    consequence it would be impossible for them  to  continue  family  life
    outside Denmark and expulsion was accordingly disproportionate  to  the
    legitimate aim. We are not aware of a case where the  Strasbourg  court
    has held that family life enjoyed between spouses and minor children is
    practically  impossible  abroad   but   deportation   is   nevertheless
    proportionate, but the Maslov criteria may not  have  ruled  this  out.
    Practical impossibility or insurmountable obstacles is of  significance
    in the proportionality assessment but it is not  the  single  criterion
    for assessing whether there is a violation of Article 8.

56. In the United Kingdom the House of Lords, Supreme Court and  the  Court
    of Appeal  have in recent years identified that a relevant question  as
    to whether immigration action  constitutes  an  interference  with  the
    right to respect for family life, is whether it is reasonable to expect
    the spouse or child to follow the claimant to the country of removal or
    deportation: see for example Huang [2007] UKHL 11 [2007] 2  AC  167  at
    [35]; AB (Jamaica) [2007] EWCA Civ 1302 at  [33];  Beoku-Betts  [2008]
    UKHL 39 at [48]; EB (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL at [41]; LM (DRC) [2008] EWCA
    Civ 325; VW (Uganda)  [2009] EWCA Civ 5  at  [40]  to  [53]  ;  and  AF
    (Jamaica) [2009] EWCA Civ 240 at [20] and [42].

57. At one end of the spectrum are cases where both parties to  a  marriage
    come from the same country, are nationals of that country, are familiar
    with the language,  religion  and  way  of  life  there,  and  face  no
    obstacles  to  relocation.   Immigration  action  may  hardly   be   an
    interference  with  family  life  at  all  and  very  little   by   way
    justification would be required to enforce the ordinary scheme  of  the
    state's immigration control regime. At  the  other  end  the  practical
    impossibility of enjoying family life outside the Contracting state  is
    likely to make the interference disproportionate.

58. In between these two ends of the spectrum are cases  like  the  present
    three where the Maslov factors are of importance, in particular:

            i) the nature and seriousness of the offence committed  by  the
               applicant and the strength of the case for deterrence;
           ii)  the duration of the applicant's stay in  the  country  from
               which he is going to be expelled, the status  on  entry  and
               whence family ties were instituted;
          iii) the time which has  elapsed  since  the  commission  of  the
               offence and  the applicant's conduct during that period;
           iv) the nationalities of the various persons concerned;
            v) the applicant's family situation, such as the length of  the
               marriage and other factors revealing whether the couple lead
               a real and genuine family life;
           vi) whether the spouse knew about the offence at the  time  when
               he or she entered into a family relationship;
          vii) whether there are children in the marriage and, if so, their
               age, the length of residence in the  host  state  and  their
               best interests
         viii) the seriousness of the difficulties which the  spouse  would
               be  likely  to  encounter  in  the  applicant's  country  of
               origin[2].

6. The interests of the child

59. ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011]  UKSC  4  concerned  a  mother  who  was  a
    national of Tanzania and formed a relationship with a British  citizen.
    They had two children, a daughter, T, born in 1998  (who  was  then  12
    years old) and a son, J, born in 2001 (who was then  9).  The  children
    were both British citizens, having been born here to  parents,  one  of
    whom was a British citizen. They had lived here with their  mother  all
    their lives, nearly all of the time at the same address.  The Court  of
    Appeal upheld the Tribunal's finding that the children could reasonably
    be expected to follow their mother  to  Tanzania.   The  Supreme  Court
    considered: "in what circumstances  is  it  permissible  to  remove  or
    deport a non-citizen parent where the effect will be that a  child  who
    is a citizen of the United Kingdom will also have to leave?

60. Lady Hale giving the leading judgment  said at [25]-[33]
             ....it  is  clear  from  the  recent  jurisprudence  that   the
             Strasbourg Court will  expect  national  authorities  to  apply
             article 3(1) of UNCRC and treat the best interests of  a  child
             as "a primary consideration". Of course, despite the  looseness
             with  which  these  terms  are  sometimes  used,   "a   primary
             consideration" is not the same as "the primary  consideration",
             still less as "the paramount consideration". Miss Joanna Dodson
             QC, to whom we  are  grateful  for  representing  the  separate
             interests of the children in  this  case,  boldly  argued  that
             immigration and removal decisions might be covered  by  section
             1(1) of the Children Act 1989:
             "When a court determines any question with respect to -
             (a)  the upbringing of a child; or
             (b)   the  administration  of  a  child's   property   or   the
               application of any income arising from it,
             the  child's   welfare   shall   be   the   court's   paramount
             consideration."
             However, questions with respect to the upbringing  of  a  child
             must be distinguished from other  decisions  which  may  affect
             them. The UNHCR, in its  Guidelines  on  Determining  the  Best
             Interests of the Child (May 2008), explains the matter  neatly,
             at para 1.1:
             "The term 'best interests' broadly describes the well-being  of
             a child. . . . The CRC neither offers a precise definition, nor
             explicitly outlines common factors of the best interests of the
             child, but stipulates that:
                o the best interests must be  the  determining  factor  for
                  specific  actions,  notably  adoption  (Article  21)  and
                  separation of a child from  parents  against  their  will
                  (Article 9);
                o the best interests must be a primary (but not  the  sole)
                  consideration for all other actions  affecting  children,
                  whether undertaken by public or  private  social  welfare
                  institutions, courts of law,  administrative  authorities
                  or legislative bodies (Article 3)."
              This seems to me accurately to distinguish between  decisions
              which directly affect the child's  upbringing,  such  as  the
              parent or  other  person  with  whom  she  is  to  live,  and
              decisions which may  affect  her  more  indirectly,  such  as
              decisions about where one or both of her parents are to live.
              Article 9 of UNCRC, for example, draws a distinction  between
              the compulsory separation of a child from her parents,  which
              must be necessary in her best interests, and  the  separation
              of a parent  from  his  child,  for  example,  by  detention,
              imprisonment, exile, deportation or even death.
           1. Nevertheless, even in those decisions, the best interests  of
              the child must be a primary consideration. As  Mason  CJ  and
              Deane J put it in the case of Minister  for  Immigration  and
              Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20, (1995) 183 CLR 273,  292
              in the High Court of Australia:
              "A decision-maker with an eye to the principle  enshrined  in
              the Convention would be looking to the best interests of  the
              children as a primary consideration, asking whether the force
              of any other consideration outweighed it."
              As the Federal Court of Australia further explained in Wan  v
              Minister for Immigration and  Multi-cultural  Affairs  [2001]
              FCA 568, para 32,
              "[The Tribunal]  was  required  to  identify  what  the  best
              interests of Mr Wan's children required with respect  to  the
              exercise of its discretion and then  to  assess  whether  the
              strength of any other consideration, or the cumulative effect
              of other considerations, outweighed the consideration of  the
              best interests  of  the  children  understood  as  a  primary
              consideration."
              This did not mean (as it would do  in  other  contexts)  that
              identifying their best interests would lead inexorably  to  a
              decision in conformity with those  interests.  Provided  that
              the  Tribunal  did  not  treat  any  other  consideration  as
              inherently more significant than the best  interests  of  the
              children, it could conclude that the strength  of  the  other
              considerations  outweighed   them.   The   important   thing,
              therefore, is to consider those best  interests  first.  That
              seems, with respect, to be  the  correct  approach  to  these
              decisions in this country as well as in Australia.
           1. However, our attention was also drawn to General Comment No 6
              of the United Nations Committee on the Rights  of  the  Child
              (2005), on  the  Treatment  of  Unaccompanied  and  Separated
              Children  Outside  their  Country  of  Origin.  The  context,
              different from ours, was the return of such children to their
              countries of origin even though they could not be returned to
              the care of their parents or other family members (para  85).
              At para 86, the Committee observed:
              "Exceptionally, a return to the home country may be arranged,
              after careful balancing of the  child's  best  interests  and
              other considerations, if  the  latter  are  rights-based  and
              override best interests of the child. Such may be the case in
              situations in which the child constitutes a serious  risk  to
              the security of the State or to the society. Non-rights based
              arguments  such  as  those  relating  to  general   migration
              control, cannot override best interests considerations."
           1. A similar distinction between "rights-based" and "non-rights-
              based" arguments is drawn in the UNHCR Guidelines (see,  para
              3.6). With  respect,  it  is  difficult  to  understand  this
              distinction in the context of article 8(2) of the ECHR.  Each
              of the legitimate aims listed there may involve individual as
              well as community interests. If the prevention of disorder or
              crime is seen as protecting the rights of other  individuals,
              as it appears that the CRC would do, it is not  easy  to  see
              why the protection of the economic well-being of the  country
              is not also protecting the rights of  other  individuals.  In
              reality, however, an argument that the continued presence  of
              a particular individual in the country poses a specific  risk
              to others may more easily outweigh the best interests of that
              or any other child than an argument that his or her continued
              presence poses a more general threat to  the  economic  well-
              being of the country. It may amount to no more than that.
              Applying these principles
           1. Applying, therefore, the approach in Wan to the assessment of
              proportionality under article 8(2), together with the factors
              identified in Strasbourg, what is encompassed  in  the  "best
              interests of the child"? As the UNHCR says, it broadly  means
              the well-being of the child. Specifically,  as  Lord  Bingham
              indicated in EB (Kosovo), it will involve asking  whether  it
              is reasonable to expect the child to live in another country.
              Relevant to this will be the level of the child's integration
              in this country and the length  of  absence  from  the  other
              country; where and with whom the child is  to  live  and  the
              arrangements  for  looking  after  the  child  in  the  other
              country; and the strength of the child's  relationships  with
              parents or other family members which will be severed if  the
              child has to move away.
           1.  Although  nationality  is  not  a  "trump  card"  it  is  of
              particular importance in assessing the best interests of  any
              child. The UNCRC recognises the right of every  child  to  be
              registered and acquire  a  nationality  (Article  7)  and  to
              preserve her identity, including her nationality (Article 8).
              In Wan, the Federal Court of Australia, pointed out  at  para
              30 that, when considering the  possibility  of  the  children
              accompanying their father to  China,  the  tribunal  had  not
              considered any of the  following  matters,  which  the  Court
              clearly regarded as important:
              "(a) the fact that the children, as  citizens  of  Australia,
                 would be deprived of the country of  their  own  and  their
                 mother's citizenship, 'and of its protection  and  support,
                 socially, culturally and medically, and in many other  ways
                 evoked by, but  not  confined  to,  the  broad  concept  of
                 lifestyle' (Vaitaiki v Minister for Immigration and  Ethnic
                 Affairs [1998] FCA 5, (1998) 150 ALR 608, 614);
              (b) the resultant social and linguistic disruption  of  their
                 childhood as well as the loss of their homeland;
              (c) the loss of educational opportunities  available  to  the
                 children in Australia; and
              (d) their resultant isolation from  the  normal  contacts  of
                 children with their mother and their mother's family."
           1.  Substituting   "father"   for   "mother",   all   of   these
              considerations apply to the children in this case.  They  are
              British children; they are  British,  not  just  through  the
              "accident" of being born here, but by descent from a  British
              parent; they have an unqualified right of  abode  here;  they
              have lived here all their  lives;  they  are  being  educated
              here; they have other social links with the  community  here;
              they have a good relationship with their father here.  It  is
              not enough to say that a young child  may  readily  adapt  to
              life in another country. That may well be so, particularly if
              she moves with both her parents to a country which they  know
              well and where they can  easily  re-integrate  in  their  own
              community (as might have been the case, for example, in Poku,
              para 20, above). But it is very  different  in  the  case  of
              children who have lived here all their lives  and  are  being
              expected to move to a country which they do not know and will
              be separated from a parent whom they also know well.
           1. Nor should the intrinsic importance of citizenship be  played
              down. As citizens these children have rights which they  will
              not be able to exercise if they move to another country. They
              will lose the advantages of growing up and being educated  in
              their own country, their own culture and their own  language.
              They will have lost all this when they come back  as  adults.
              As Jacqueline  Bhaba  (in  'The  "Mere  Fortuity  of  Birth"?
              Children, Mothers, Borders and the Meaning  of  Citizenship',
              in Migrations and Mobilities: Citizenship, Borders and Gender
              (2009), edited by Seyla Benhabib and Judith Resnik, at p 193)
              has put it:
              'In short, the fact of belonging to a  country  fundamentally
              affects the manner  of  exercise  of  a  child's  family  and
              private life, during childhood and well beyond. Yet children,
              particularly young children,  are  often  considered  parcels
              that are easily movable across borders with their parents and
              without particular cost to the children.'
           1. We now have a much greater understanding of the importance of
              these issues in  assessing  the  overall  well-being  of  the
              child. In making the proportionality assessment under article
              8, the  best  interests  of  the  child  must  be  a  primary
              consideration. This means that they must be considered first.
              They can, of course, be outweighed by the  cumulative  effect
              of other considerations. In  this  case,  the  countervailing
              considerations were  the  need  to  maintain  firm  and  fair
              immigration control,  coupled  with  the  mother's  appalling
              immigration history and the precariousness  of  her  position
              when family life was created. But, as  the  Tribunal  rightly
              pointed out, the children were not to be blamed for that. And
              the inevitable result of removing their primary  carer  would
              be that they had to leave with her. On the facts,  it  is  as
              least as strong a case as Edore v Secretary of State for  the
              Home Department [2003] 1 WLR 2979, where Simon Brown LJ  held
              that "there really is only room for one view" (para  26).  In
              those circumstances, the Secretary of State was clearly right
              to concede that there could be only one answer."
61. Lord Hope concurring  added at [41]:


           The fact of British citizenship does not trump everything  else.
           But it will hardly ever be less  than  a  very  significant  and
           weighty factor against moving children who have that  status  to
           another country with a parent who has no right to  remain  here,
           especially if the  effect  of  doing  this  is  that  they  will
           inevitably lose those benefits and advantages for  the  rest  of
           their childhood.


    He concluded at [44]:


           There is an obvious tension  between  the  need  to  maintain  a
           proper and efficient  system  of  immigration  control  and  the
           principle that, where children are involved, the best  interests
           of the children must be  a  primary  consideration.  The  proper
           approach, as was explained in Wan v Minister for Immigration and
           Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 568, para 32, is, having  taken
           this as  the  starting  point,  to  assess  whether  their  best
           interests  are  outweighed  by  the  strength   of   any   other
           considerations. The fact that the  mother's  immigration  status
           was precarious when they were conceived may lead to a  suspicion
           that the parents saw this as a way of strengthening her case for
           being allowed to remain here. But considerations  of  that  kind
           cannot be held against the children in this assessment. It would
           be wrong  in  principle  to  devalue  what  was  in  their  best
           interests by something for which they could in no way be held to
           be responsible.


62. Lord Kerr agreed and added his  own  observation  at  [46-47]  that  'a
    primacy of importance' that must be accorded to the best interests of a
    child of which United Kingdom nationality formed a significant part:
           The significance of a child's nationality must be considered  in
           two aspects. The first of these is in its role as a  contributor
           to the debate as to where the child's  best  interests  lie.  It
           seems to me self evident that to diminish  a  child's  right  to
           assert his or her nationality will not normally be in his or her
           best interests. That consideration must therefore feature in the
           determination of where the  best  interests  lie.  It  was  also
           accepted by the respondent, however, (and I  think  rightly  so)
           that if a child is a British citizen, this  has  an  independent
           value, freestanding of the debate in relation to best interests,
           and this must weigh in the balance  in  any  decision  that  may
           affect where a child will live. As Lady Hale has said,  this  is
           not an inevitably decisive factor but the benefits that  British
           citizenship brings, as so aptly described by Lord Hope and  Lady
           Hale, must not readily be discounted.
63. ZH (Tanzania) was a removal case.  Poor  as  the  mother's  immigration
    history was assessed to be, she had not  been  convicted  for  criminal
    offences disturbing the general public order. Lady Hale recognised that
    a rights based approach to factors that outweighed the interests of the
    child as a primary consideration would  more  readily  find  weight  in
    protecting the public from dangerous  individuals.   We  conclude  that
    preventing crime  by  deporting  individuals  in  cases  of  particular
    seriousness would also be a legitimate aim that could outweigh the best
    interests of children, particularly when combined with other aspects of
    the public interest.

64. As already noted the case of Lee (supra para 49) was such a case  where
    the Court of Appeal  considered  the  impact  of  ZH  (Tanzania)  in  a
    revocation  appeal  by  someone  sentenced  to  a   lengthy   term   of
    imprisonment for drug related offending.  Although the Court talked  of
    permanent separation, we do not understand that it was excluding future
    revocation  after  the  expiry  of  an  appropriate  passage  of  time,
    particularly where some contact could be maintained between parent  and
    child[3]. Although it may have been unreasonable to expect  the  family
    to live in Jamaica, there was no suggestion  that  it  was  practically
    impossible for them to do so or  that  cultural  differences  or  other
    factors prevented visits there.

65. The Upper Tribunal has considered these cases in its  determination  in
    Omotunde (best interests) [2011] UKUT 00247 (IAC) where it set out  the
    current approach to proportionality in the context of  deportation.  We
    summarise the learning relevant to deportation cases as follows:-

          a. Article 8 is to be interpreted  in  a  manner  consistent  with
             Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the  Child  and
             the statutory duty to  have  regard  to  guidance  designed  to
             promote the best interests or welfare of the child set  out  in
             s.55 the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.
          b. The welfare of the child is  a  primary  but  not  a  paramount
             consideration in immigration decision making. That is to say it
             is a consideration of the first order and not merely a  factor,
             but not the only consideration or necessarily  a  determinative
             consideration.
          c.     The  welfare  principle   applies   irrespective   of   the
             nationality of the child, but where the child is  British  that
             is a particular pointer to the place where the  child's  future
             lies.  British  nationality  imposed  a  significantly   higher
             threshold when a decision-maker was considering whether a child
             should be expected to join a parent abroad.
          d. Factors that may  outweigh  the  welfare  of  the  child  in  a
             particular case are rights based considerations such  as  those
             contained in Article 8 (2)  in  particular  the  prevention  of
             disorder or crime or the protection of the health and rights of
             others.
          e.    Weighty reasons are required to justify separating a  family
             who are legitimately resident together in the United Kingdom.
          f.    Even where it is not reasonable to expect the other  partner
             to a relationship or  the  children  to  accompany  the  person
             subject to immigration action to reside abroad the interference
             with family life may be justified.
          g. Notwithstanding the distress caused to a child and the loss  of
             advantage to the child of (in these cases) a father's  presence
             guidance  and  support,  the  conduct   of  the  person  facing
             deportation may be so contrary to the  public  interest  as  to
             make such separation proportionate and justified.








66. We further note that in respect of children (foreign or British) in the
    United Kingdom there is the  statutory guidance on making  arrangements
    to safeguard and  promote  the  welfare  of  children   issued  by  the
    Secretary of State under s.55 the Borders, Citizenship Immigration  Act
    2009 "Every Child Matters Change for Children." Paragraph 1.4 states:

           Safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children is defined in
           the guidance to section 11 of the 2004 Act as:
             . protecting children from maltreatment;
             . preventing impairment of children's  health  or  development
               (where  health  means  'physical  or  mental   health'   and
               development means 'physical, intellectual, emotional, social
               or behavioural development');
             . ensuring that  children  are  growing  up  in  circumstances
               consistent with the provision of safe and effective care;
             . and undertaking that role so as to enable those children  to
               have  optimum  life   chances   and   to   enter   adulthood
               successfully.


67. In re-making these decisions we give particular importance to the  fact
    the children are British as a strong pointer to  the  fact  that  their
    future lies in the United Kingdom. If their fathers  are  removed  each
    child will suffer the loss  of  the  presence  of  a  father  from  the
    household in which they now are growing up. We shall  consider  whether
    there is evidence that such an event would cause maltreatment, loss  of
    safety or impairment of health or development.

7. The application of  Article 20 TFEU as interpreted in Zambrano


68. Since the decision in ZH Tanzania the importance of the nationality  of
    the child has been emphasised by developments in  European  Union  law.
    The spouses/partners and children  of  each  of  these  appellants  are
    British citizens.  None has exercised Treaty rights by living,  working
    or engaging in relevant economic activity in another Member State. They
    have not moved to or resided in a Member state other than that of which
    they are a national. So none of the family members in these appeals can
    be the beneficiary of rights under the Citizen's Directive.

69.  In  Zambrano,  the  Court  of  Justice  considered  that  in   certain
    circumstances,  even  where  there  had  been  no  such  trans-national
    movement, and no rights under the Directive, Article 20 of  the  Treaty
    on the Functioning of the European Union may be relied on directly. The
    Article is in these terms:-

           Article 20 (ex Article 17 TEC)
           1.    Citizenship of the  Union  is  hereby  established.  Every
               person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be  a
               citizen of the Union. Citizenship  of  the  Union  shall  be
               additional to and not replace national citizenship.
           2.    Citizens of the  Union  shall  enjoy  the  rights  and  be
               subject to the duties provided for  in  the  Treaties.  They
               shall have, inter alia:


                  (a) the right  to  move  and  reside  freely  within  the
                     territory of the Member States;
                  (b) ...
                  (c) ...
                  (d) ...
           These  rights  shall  be  exercised  in  accordance   with   the
           conditions and  limits  defined  by  the  Treaties  and  by  the
           measures adopted thereunder.


70. In this case a Colombian couple,  who  lived  in  Belgian  but  had  no
    residence rights there, gave birth to two children who  became  Belgian
    citizens under provisions designed to prevent them being  stateless  as
    they had not acquired Columbian nationality.

71. The two children were infants and dependent  on  their  parents.  Their
    parents sought the right to reside and work  in  Belgian  in  order  to
    support their Belgian children. The Court said this:
           41.   As the Court has stated several times, citizenship of  the
               Union is intended to be the fundamental status of  nationals
               of  the  Member  States  (see,  inter  alia,  Case  C-184/99
               Grzelczyk [2001] ECR I-6193,  paragraph  31;  Case  C-413/99
               Baumbast and R  [2002]  ECR  I-7091,  paragraph  82;  Garcia
               Avello, paragraph  22;  Zhu  and  Chen,  paragraph  25;  and
               Rottmann, paragraph 43).
           42.   In those circumstances, Article 20 TFEU precludes national
               measures which have the effect of depriving citizens of  the
               Union of the genuine  enjoyment  of  the  substance  of  the
               rights conferred by virtue of their status  as  citizens  of
               the Union (see, to that effect, Rottmann, paragraph 42).
           43.   A refusal to grant a right of residence to a third country
               national with dependent minor children in the  Member  State
               where those children are nationals and reside,  and  also  a
               refusal to grant such a person a work permit,  has  such  an
               effect.
           44.   It must be assumed that such a refusal  would  lead  to  a
               situation where those children, citizens of the Union, would
               have to leave  the  territory  of  the  Union  in  order  to
               accompany their parents. Similarly, if a  work  permit  were
               not granted to such a  person,  he  would  risk  not  having
               sufficient resources to provide for himself and his  family,
               which would also result in the  children,  citizens  of  the
               Union, having to leave the territory of the Union. In  those
               circumstances, those citizens  of  the  Union  would,  as  a
               result, be unable to exercise the substance  of  the  rights
               conferred on them by virtue of their status as  citizens  of
               the Union.
           45.   Accordingly, the answer to the questions referred is  that
               Article 20 TFEU is to be  interpreted  as  meaning  that  it
               precludes a Member  State  from  refusing  a  third  country
               national upon whom his  minor  children,  who  are  European
               Union citizens, are dependent, a right of residence  in  the
               Member State of residence and nationality of those children,
               and from refusing to grant  a  work  permit  to  that  third
               country national, in so far as such decisions deprive  those
               children of the genuine enjoyment of the  substance  of  the
               rights attaching to the status of European Union citizen.
72. Each of the appellants submits that these observations have application
    to them. The Union citizenship affords the  family  members  rights  of
    residence in the Union and is destined to be the fundamental status  of
    the Union. The rights incidental to that status cannot be exercised  if
    the children of their mothers or both have to live in India or  Jamaica
    respectively with each of the appellants.

73. The respondent disagrees with this  submission.  She  contends  in  her
    written submissions that the Zambrano principle is confined to a narrow
    factual scenario, namely:

           "when refusing residence would deprive the Union citizen of  the
           genuine enjoyment of the substance of their European citizenship
           rights. In practice this means that  refusal  of  the  right  of
           residence to the third country national, and so  their  removal,
           would require the Union Citizen to leave  the  Member  state  by
           virtue of their dependency upon the third country national.


           ...For the United Kingdom, this means that the judgment  applies
           only to cases involving a  dependent  British  citizen.  However
           where there is another parent or guardian upon whom the child is
           or can become dependent. Then this will fall out of the scope of
           Ruiz Zambrano. This is because the removal of the third  country
           national would not oblige the child to leave the EU  because  an
           alternative care is available."

74. The respondent further contends that a third  country  national  cannot
    rely on Article 20 for greater  protection  than  is  provided  by  the
    Citizens Directive:

         "where a person potentially comes within the scope of Ruiz Zambrano
         they can still be deported where their presence in the UK   is  not
         in the public interest."

75. We will deal with this  supplementary  submission  first.   On  the  24
    October 2011 we posed two questions of the respondent  in  response  to
    this submission:-

            1. What is the source of the proportionality derogation of  the
               child's Treaty rights?
            2. If there is a power to outweigh the child's Treaty rights by
               the public  interest  in  deporting  someone  whose  conduct
               otherwise makes deportation conducive to the public good, is
               this an EU balance thus essentially requiring  the  deportee
               to represent a present and personal  threat  to  the  public
               interest, see for example C-340/97 Nazli [2000] ECR 1-957 or
               an Article 8 balance unconnected to EU law where  deterrence
               may have a role to play?


76.  In  the  answer  to  these  questions  we  received  helpful   written
    submissions on behalf of the respondent  from  Mr  Devereux,  Assistant
    Director UKBA and Head of European Operation Policy, for which  we  are
    grateful.  He drew our attention to Articles  45(3),  52  and  62  TFEU
    permitting derogations from free movement rights of workers, the  self-
    employed and those providing services on grounds of public policy.

77. Chapter VI of the Citizens Directive is  headed  "Restrictions  on  the
    Right of Entry and the Right of Residence on Grounds of Public  Policy,
    Public Security or Public Health.  Articles  27  to  31  establish  the
    criteria and procedural protections available to EU  citizens  who  are
    exercising the specific free movement rights referred  to  in  Articles
    45, 52 and 62 and also the general right of free  movement  exercisable
    simply as a citizen. The Preamble to the Directive  refers  to  Article
    18 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community in these terms:

           "Every citizen of the Union shall have the  right  to  move  and
           reside freely within the territory of the Member States, subject
           to the limitations and conditions laid down in this  Treaty  and
           by the measures adopted to give it effect."

78. Mr Devereux also reminded us of the terms of  Article  20  itself  that
    provide that the right to move and reside freely within  the  territory
    of the Member states is subject both to "the limitations and conditions
    laid down in this Treaty" and "by  the  measures  adopted  to  give  it
    effect". We were not referred to any other provision of the Treaty that
    subjects the right of residence to limitations and  conditions,  so  we
    must turn to the measures to give it effect.

79. The written answer then continues:

           "As we assert that Directive 2004/38/EC is not applicable,  then
           the relevant  principles  governing  the  derogation  on  public
           interest grounds must be determined on the basis of the domestic
           laws of the Member States. The  application  of  those  domestic
           laws will, of course, be subject to the  general  principles  of
           Union law (where the conditions set down in  Ruiz  Zambrano  are
           met); and the ECHR. In this regard, the particular circumstances
           justifying a derogation on public interest grounds may vary from
           one country to another and from one period to another".


80. We do not accept the respondent's submission that EU law leaves  it  to
    national law to decide whatever  restriction  on  rights  each  country
    considers appropriate from time to time. Whilst the national court  may
    decide its own laws as to citizenship, the  law  of  Union  citizenship
    lies inevitably within EU law.  If exceptions exist in EU  law,  it  is
    illogical and inconsistent with principle for those restrictions to  be
    determined  nationally.  The  respondent's  submission  seems   to   us
    inconsistent with virtually everything the Court  of  Justice  has  had
    about the need for an EU interpretation of Treaty rights.

81. We note that in cases of rights afforded to Turkish Nationals under the
    Ankara Agreement, the European Court has required  that  public  policy
    derogation be  strictly  interpreted  and  precluded  purely  deterrent
    measures that might otherwise be available in national law. Thus in  C-
    340/97 Nazli [2000] ECR I-957at [59] the Court said :
           The Court has thus concluded that Community  law  precludes  the
           expulsion of a national of a Member State on general  preventive
           grounds, that is to say an expulsion ordered for the purpose  of
           deterring  other  aliens  (see,  in   particular,   Case   67/74
           Bonsignore v Stadt K�ln [1975] ECR 297, paragraph 7), especially
           where  that  measure  has  automatically  followed  a   criminal
           conviction, without any account  being  taken  of  the  personal
           conduct of the offender or of  the  danger  which  that  conduct
           represents for the requirements of public policy  (Calfa,  cited
           above, paragraph 27).
82. It is inconceivable that lesser standards would  apply  to  derogations
    from  Treaty  rights  afforded  to  European  Citizens  themselves.  In
    practice we would anticipate that Article 27 Citizens  Directive  would
    have to apply. It states:


           measures taken on grounds of public policy  or  public  security
           shall comply with the principle of proportionality and shall  be
           based exclusively on the  personal  conduct  of  the  individual
           concerned. Previous criminal convictions shall not in themselves
           constitute  grounds  for  taking  such  measures.  The  personal
           conduct of the individual concerned must  represent  a  genuine,
           present and sufficiently serious threat  affecting  one  of  the
           fundamental  interest  of  society.  Justifications   that   are
           isolated from the particular facts of the case or that  rely  on
           considerations of general prevention shall not be accepted.


83. If the residence right is only afforded to the non-citizen parent where
    otherwise the child would be forced to leave  the  European  Union,  it
    seems difficult to justify that consequence by reason of  the  criminal
    wrongdoing of the parent. It is one thing to justify the  exclusion  of
    an EU national from one part of the  Union  requiring  him  or  her  to
    return to their state of nationality, and quite another to require that
    person to leave the Union altogether. It seems to us that the Court  of
    Justice was applying the principle of international law that a  citizen
    cannot be expelled from  their  own  state  in  any  circumstances,  to
    citizenship of the European Union and concluding that  a  measure  that
    required an EU citizen to leave the Union would be contrary to EU law.

84. In Zambrano, there was no  suggestion  that  the  children  as  Belgian
    citizens, could be expelled from Belgium. Nor, as Union citizens, could
    they be expelled from the Union as  a  whole  and,  had  there  been  a
    decision made by the Belgian authorities to that effect, it would  have
    been justiciable by the Court of Justice.  But the Court went  further:
    the expulsion of their Colombian parents (not citizens  of  the  Union)
    amounted to the children's constructive expulsion from the  Union.  The
    Court was not therefore directly applying  Article  20  which  is  non-
    derogable but granting rights to non-Union citizens necessary  to  give
    effect to the rights of Union  citizens.  However,  if  the  collateral
    right of residence afforded to the parents is a narrow one and  limited
    to cases where it is necessary to enable the child to enjoy his or  her
    rights, it may very well be that there is no room for any derogation at
    all, and our assumptions to the contrary in Omutunde  at  paragraph  32
    (cited at [65] above) should not be regarded as sound in the absence of
    a decision of the Court of Justice on the point in a case  that  raised
    the issue.

85. We now return to the principal question, whether the deportation of any
    of these three appellants requires their  minor  children  to  give  up
    their residence in the European Union.

86. We consider  that  the  respondent's  submissions  on  this  issue  are
    substantially supported by the decision of the Court of Justice in  the
    subsequent decision in C-256/11 Murat Dereci and others [2011]  ECR  1-
    0000.

87. The claimants in this decision  were  spouses  and  adult  children  of
    Austrian citizens resident in Austria. There were  two  common  themes:
    the Austrian citizens had never exercised Treaty rights to move  to  or
    reside in another Member state, and the citizens were  not  financially
    dependent on the family member facing expulsion. The Court rejected  an
    attempt to expand the Zambrano principle to give rights of residence to
    all  non-national parents  and said:-
           66.   It follows that the criterion relating to  the  denial  of
               the  genuine  enjoyment  of  the  substance  of  the  rights
               conferred by virtue of European Union citizen status  refers
               to situations in which the Union citizen has,  in  fact,  to
               leave not only the territory of the Member State of which he
               is a national but also the  territory  of  the  Union  as  a
               whole.
           67     That criterion is specific in character inasmuch  as  it
               relates  to  situations  in  which,   although   subordinate
               legislation on the  right  of  residence  of  third  country
               nationals is not applicable, a right of residence  may  not,
               exceptionally, be refused to a third country  national,  who
               is a family member  of  a  Member  State  national,  as  the
               effectiveness of Union citizenship enjoyed by that  national
               would otherwise be undermined.
           68      Consequently,  the  mere  fact  that  it  might  appear
               desirable to a national of  a  Member  State,  for  economic
               reasons or in order to  keep  his  family  together  in  the
               territory of the Union, for the members of his family who do
               not have the nationality of a Member State  to  be  able  to
               reside with him in  the  territory  of  the  Union,  is  not
               sufficient in itself to support  the  view  that  the  Union
               citizen will be forced to leave Union territory  if  such  a
               right is not granted.
           69     That finding is, admittedly, without  prejudice  to  the
               question whether, on the  basis  of  other  criteria,  inter
               alia, by virtue of the right to  the  protection  of  family
               life, a right of residence cannot be refused. However,  that
               question must be tackled in the framework of the  provisions
               on the protection of fundamental rights which are applicable
               in each case.
88. Mr Dereci was a Turkish national who had entered Austria illegally  and
    was married to an Austrian citizen by whom he had three minor children.
    The family lived together in the same household. It is to  be  inferred
    from the decision that the children would  not  be  required  to  leave
    Austria by reason of their father's  removal  because  they  had  their
    mother to turn to for support and care. In fact, Mr Dereci succeeded on
    another point considered by the Court,  namely  his  rights  under  the
    Ankara Agreement, but that is irrelevant to the present appeals.

89. In the present cases the mothers of all of the British citizen children
    are citizens themselves and cannot be removed as family  members  of  a
    person facing deportation or in their own right. Although  the  removal
    of the father would have adverse economic impact on all  the  families,
    as well as the interests of each child living in a household  with  its
    father, it cannot be said that either the  children  or  their  mothers
    will be required to leave with him. There is an analogy with  the  case
    of Mr Dereci who was found not to have a Zambrano right  of  residence.
    Economic reasons for maintaining family unity are not sufficient.

90. We recognise that the appellants have submitted by way  of  reply  that
    according to the  Advocate  General's  opinion  an  impairment  of  the
    exercise of the Treaty right of residence may  suffice  to  engage  the
    Zambrano principle. This was not how the Court answered  the  question,
    however, and in our judgment, if on the facts removal of the  appellant
    will not require the children or spouse to follow because they have  no
    capacity for exercising their Treaty rights independent of  the  person
    facing removal, what is being impaired is not the right  to  reside  in
    the EU but the right to enjoy family life whilst so residing.

91. Each of the children are not accordingly dependent on their fathers for
    the exercise of their Union rights of  residence  and  removal  of  the
    fathers will not deprive them of the effective exercise of  that  right
    of residence in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the Union.


92. Cases where the remaining parent not facing removal is either a British
    citizen or a third country national will be governed by Article 8.   It
    is in that context that the nationality of the remaining parent as well
    as that of the child has relevance.

93. Finally, we note that a further question on  which  we  asked  for  the
    respondent's assistance was in these terms:

           "Does the respondent agree that in a case where  a  non-national
           parent is being removed and claims it is  a  violation  of  that
           person's human rights to be separated from a child with whom  he
           presently enjoys family  life  as  an  engaged  parent,  that  a
           consequence of the CJEU's judgment is that it is not open to the
           respondent to submit that an interference can be avoided because
           it is reasonable to expect the child (and presumably  any  other
           parent/carer who is not facing deportation/removal) to join  the
           appellant in the country of origin?  If not why not?"

94. To this Mr Devereux replied on 24 November 2011:


           "We do accept, however, that in a case  where  a  third  country
           national is unable to claim a right to reside on the  basis  set
           out above it will not logically be possible, when assessing  the
           compatibility of their removal or deportation with the  ECHR  to
           argue that any interference  with  Article  8  rights  could  be
           avoided by the family unit moving to a country which is  outside
           of the EU".


95. We shall take this helpful submission into account when we consider the
    application of Article 8 to each appellant's case. We  agree  with  it.
    This means that where the child or indeed the  remaining  spouse  is  a
    British citizen and therefore a citizen of the European  Union,  it  is
    not possible to require them to relocate outside of the European  Union
    or to submit that it would be reasonable for them to do  so.  The  case
    serves to emphasise the importance of nationality already identified in
    the decision of the Supreme Court in  ZH  (Tanzania).  If  interference
    with the family life is to be justified, it can only be  on  the  basis
    that  the  conduct  of  the  person  to  be  removed  gives   rise   to
    considerations of such weight as to justify separation.

8.  The Assessment of individual appeals


96. Having set out the body of principles that applies to cases such as the
    present appeals we will now remake the decisions in the  light  of  the
    particular circumstances of each case.

Sanade
97. Mr Sanade is a citizen of India born in 1975.  He  first  came  to  the
    United Kingdom in July 2003 with leave to  enter  as  a  student.  This
    leave was varied to permit him to undertake approved  employment  as  a
    nurse with an NHS hospital trust. He remained in such employment  until
    2010 and the events giving rise to the decision to deport him.


98. Whilst he was in the United Kingdom he met his wife Veli. She was  also
    an Indian national and a qualified nurse who had  come  to  the  United
    Kingdom for study and employment as such in her own right.  Mr and  Mrs
    Sanade are both members of the Seventh Day Adventist Church. Mrs Sanade
    had been brought up in an orphanage run by that  Church  in  India.  In
    March 2005 they married at a church in Bangalore, India.  In  2006  the
    couple bought a home together in Chingford Essex and have two children,
    P born on 17 July 2007 and N born on 13 February 2010.   In  July  2009
    they were granted indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom. Mrs
    Sanade had completed four years in approved employment  and  Mr  Sanade
    had been treated as  her  dependant  since  2006,  so  he  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain in line with her. Up to  this  point,  these
    facts  show  a  history  of  an  ordinary  couple,  who  qualified  for
    admission and permanent residence under the Immigration Rules by virtue
    of their employment in public service as nurses and who  had  supported
    and accommodated themselves and their young family.

99. On 24 June 2010 he was sentenced  to  12  months  imprisonment  by  the
    Chelmsford Crown Court and a sexual offences  prevention  order  (SOPO)
    was made against him.   On  29  October  2010  the  Court  of  Criminal
    Division varied the terms of the SOPO to prohibit him "from  doing  any
    work for any institution which involves the care of individuals and  in
    which he has direct access to and may  come  into  contact  with  those
    individuals".  As a result of his conduct he has been  struck  off  the
    register of nurses. His conviction and sentence meant he has to  remain
    on the sexual offenders register  for  10  years  with  the  associated
    obligation  of  notification  and  renders  him  liable  to   automatic
    deportation under the Borders Act 2007 s.32(5).

100. Mr Sanade was released on immigration bail  on  the  22  December  2010
    having served his sentence.  He appealed against a decision  to  deport
    him taken three days earlier and that appeal was heard by  a  panel  of
    the First tier Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber and dismissed on
    25 February 2011. The panel concluded that the offence was serious  and
    that the wife and  children  could  be  expected  to  return  with  the
    appellant to India to continue their family life there.

101. The panel assumed  without  deciding  that  one  of  the  children  was
    British. It noted that it was  bound  by  the  recent  decision  of  ZH
    (Tanzania) handed down in the Supreme Court on 1 February 2011.  It did
    not direct itself that the  best  interests  of  the  children  were  a
    primary consideration in considering the  appellant's  deportation  and
    did not consider what those best interests may be independent of  their
    parents or what the impact of British nationality  on  those  interests
    may be.

102. The appellant is  unable  to  work  and  has  been  looking  after  the
    children and taking P to her nursery whilst Mrs Sanade is at work.  She
    is paying the mortgage of �1,000 per month from her salary  of  �1,700.
    N was a British citizen from birth because he was born  in  the  United
    Kingdom to parents settled here.  P  has  been  registered  as  such  a
    citizen pursuant to s.3(1) British Nationality Act 1981 and on  1  June
    2011 Mrs Sanade was naturalised as such a citizen.

103. There is obviously family life enjoyed between Mr Sanade and  his  wife
    and children. It is family life that deserves respect as Mr Sanade  was
    been accepted for permanent residence as the spouse of his wife, having
    originally been admitted here as a worker. There has been no breach  of
    immigration control, no false representations used and  the  status  of
    the parties was not precarious at the time when family life was entered
    into and subsequently.

104. We accept that at eight years Mr Sanade's period of  residence  in  the
    United Kingdom has not been particularly long and  his  residence  here
    with indefinite leave to remain has been short. His wife is  of  Indian
    origin and cultural background, some ties  have  been  maintained  with
    that country, and there is nothing to suggest that  relocation  of  the
    family there would be practically impossible. The children  have  lived
    all their lives here but they remain very young without any substantial
    experience of the British education system.

105. However Mrs Sanade and both children  are  now  British  citizens.  The
    nationality of the children is an important factor as  to  where  their
    best interests lay:  ZH (Tanzania). If their nationality, domicile  and
    place of future residence is to be the United Kingdom,  their  "optimum
    life chances to enter adulthood successfully" point  to  the  need  for
    continuity of their residence  and  education  during  their  formative
    years in the United Kingdom.

106. Further as British citizens, Mrs Sanade and her children  are  citizens
    of the European Union and as such entitled to reside in the Union.  The
    respondent properly accepts that they cannot be required to  leave  the
    Union  as  a  matter  of  law,  and  that  as  a  matter  of   relevant
    consideration they cannot reasonably be expected to relocate outside of
    the European Union. Accordingly, the question  is whether  Mr  Sanade's
    conduct is so serious as to make it proportionate to the legitimate aim
    in his case to require him to leave his wife and young children for  an
    indefinite period  unless  and  until  the  deportation  order  can  be
    revoked?

107. The judge's sentencing remarks  reveal  that  on  4  February  2010  at
    10.00pm a distressed  female  patient  aged  21  years  came  into  the
    hospital where the appellant worked. She was  concerned  that  she  may
    have been suffering from breast cancer.  The appellant  caused  her  to
    expose her breasts to him, ran his hands over her breasts under  her  T
    shirt and over her body under the pretext of examining her. In  reality
    he did this for his sexual gratification.  This  was  clearly  a  gross
    breach of the trust placed in him as a member of a  caring  profession.
    It was aggravated by three features.  First,  the  appellant  told  the
    patient not to report the incident; secondly he falsified  her  records
    to make it less likely she  would  believed  if  she  did  report  him;
    thirdly although he had not previously been convicted of any offence he
    had been cautioned  in 2008 for assault on an elderly  patient  in  his
    care.  The sentencing judge concluded that  the  breach  of  trust  and
    aggravating features entitled him to depart from the Guidance issued by
    the Sentencing Guidelines Council for this class  of  offence.  Contact
    between the offender's body and a part of the victim's  body  (in  both
    cases other than the genitalia) is regarded as the least serious  class
    of sexual assault. The sentencing guidance identifies a starting  point
    for a finding of guilt after a trial is a  Community  Order  where  the
    victim is over 13.

108. The legitimate aim  here  is  the  prevention  of  disorder  and  crime
    arising out of the criminal conduct of the  husband.  In  our  judgment
    there is no other aim  engaged by his continued presence. He  has  been
    granted   indefinite   leave   to   remain   without   any   taint   of
    misrepresentation  and  his  family  life  was   established   in   the
    expectation that as a work permit holder Mrs Sanade would  be  entitled
    to remain here indefinitely.

109. There is no evidence to suggest that in his  present  circumstances  he
    poses a real risk to others. He has no history of sexual offending. His
    conduct has not been repeated since his release from prison.  The  risk
    of his abusing his position as a nurse to commit offences in the future
    is low having regard to the fact that he is prevented from  working  in
    that profession by his being struck off the register. Further the terms
    of  the  Sexual  Offences  Prevention   Order   prevent   him   working
    unsupervised with women.  He is more regulated in his future conduct in
    the United Kingdom than he would be in India.

110. Is the offence so serious as to justify the separation of  husband  and
    wife and father and minor children? Any offence punished by a  sentence
    of twelve months imprisonment  must  be  considered  serious,  but  for
    reasons we have already given, the statutory scheme does not mean  such
    a sentence makes interference with family life  proportionate  save  in
    exceptional circumstances. For the sexual  conduct  alone,  absent  the
    aggravating factors, a significantly less severe  sentence  would  have
    been appropriate. The aggravating factors have  been  in  some  measure
    addressed not only by the more severe sentence he has served but  other
    measures of general prevention including being struck off the register.
     Whilst we recognise that this was an offence involving a gross  breach
    of trust this is not criminal conduct at the higher end of the range of
    seriousness and it involves no violence,  weapons,  or  trafficking  in
    Class A drugs.

111.  In  all  these  circumstances  we  do  not  regard   the   appellant's
    deportation as proportionate to the  legitimate  aim.  Accordingly  the
    interference with the family life contemplated by  his  deportation  is
    not necessary in the public interest. We therefore re-make the decision
    by allowing his appeal.

Harrison
112. His personal life is rather complex. We will refer to his  partners  by
    their first names. He has two children born  in  1996  and  1999  by  a
    partner called Donnette; the children are in the United Kingdom but the
    mother is unwilling for the appellant to have  contact  with  them  and
    they play no significant part in this appeal.

113.  Although  Mr  Harrison  was  married  to  Chantelle  in   2000,   this
    relationship was short lived and had broken down by 2002. There are  no
    children of this relationship.  He  was  granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain on the basis of a  subsisting  relationship  with  Chantelle  in
    January 2003, but he  had  started  a  relationship  with  his  present
    partner, Kelly, in January 2001 and she became pregnant by him while in
    Jamaica on holiday in August 2001.

114. Kelly is a British citizen  born  in  the  United  Kingdom  of  parents
    originally from Jamaica. There has  been  cohabitation  since  November
    2001. There are three children of the relationship: K born May 2002;  D
    born March 2010 and KD born May 2011. They were accordingly 9 years, 14
    months and 2 months old at the time of the hearing before us.

115. The appellant  was  in  detention  from  November  2003  until  he  was
    released on bail on 1 November 2007. He has lived with his partner  and
    children since then and played an active and  positive  role  in  their
    lives. Kelly has full time employment but has been on  maternity  leave
    since March 2010 and intended to return to work in August 2010.


116. The appellant's appeal against the rejection of his  human  rights  and
    asylum claims was heard in June 2010.  He indicated that asylum was not
    the principal aspect of his case.  The panel concluded that he had made
    false statements about his family life to his probation officer and the
    author of the OASys report. He  misled  the  Home  Office  in  2003  by
    suppressing the fact that his relationship with  Chantelle  had  broken
    down. It concluded that he would not hesitate  to  deceive  to  achieve
    what he wants and further his aim. The panel noted "apart from her  own
    views we have no evidence before us as to why (K) could  not  join  her
    partner in Jamaica. The children are young and could be expected to re-
    adjust to a different way of life". It took into account the  practical
    difficulties if the mother was left as a single parent  to  look  after
    the children.

117. Mr Harrison  has  been  resident  in  the  United  Kingdom  since  1999
    initially for temporary purposes. In  2000  he  was  granted  leave  to
    remain as the spouse of Chantelle and was  given  indefinite  leave  in
    that capacity in January 2003.  However on the findings  of  fact  made
    below that leave was obtained by deception as whatever the state of the
    relationship in 2000 it had broken down in 2002 when Mr Harrison was in
    a relationship with his present partner Kelly.  Applying  the  guidance
    given in Nunez (at [47] above) we consider that  his  misrepresentation
    is a significant factor against him. His relationship with his  present
    partner whether from 1999 or 2001 was initiated against a background of
    a precarious status.


118. Within ten months of being granted indefinite leave to  remain  he  was
    arrested on very serious charges of conspiracy to supply a Class A drug
    and remained in detention thereafter. The conspiracy  started  in  July
    2003. Although he had no  previous  convictions  the  sentencing  judge
    concluded that this appellant was the leader and the person in  control
    of this conspiracy who  had  possession  of  a  prohibited  weapon.  He
    remained in custody serving his sentence of  a  total  of  seven  years
    imprisonment until he was released on licence in 2007.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal found that he lied as to the circumstances of his family  life
    to the maker of the OASys report in early 2007 and  that  he  would  be
    prepared to continue to lie to suit his ends.  This  does  not  suggest
    that the experience of custody has induced a sense of contrition and  a
    desire to subsequently lead a law-abiding life.

119. His case rests entirely on the  impact  of  deportation  on  his  three
    children born in 2002, 2009 and 2010. His family life since his release
    from prison has been maintained in the shadow of the  judge's  decision
    to recommend his deportation; the rejection of  this  asylum  claim  on
    which he relied; and the various appellate hearings in 2010 in which he
    failed to persuade the First-tier Tribunal panel or  a  Judge  of  this
    Tribunal that his deportation was disproportionate to the legitimate to
    prevent crime.

120. We recognise that his young children are the innocent  victims  of  his
    conduct.  K will have known his father for  a  short  time  before  his
    arrest and detention, but has had substantial contact  with  him  since
    his release in November 2007.  By reason of their nationality it  would
    not be reasonable to expect the children to leave  the  United  Kingdom
    and relocate permanently in Jamaica. If their father is deported K will
    lose the parental contact with his father he presently  enjoys  and  so
    will the younger children, albeit that they are  of  a  more  adaptable
    age. The best interests  of  the  children  will  be  in  some  measure
    impaired by loss of the company of their father. We recognise this is a
    consideration of the first importance.

121. However, in the overall context of this case, it is certainly  not  the
    only  consideration  and  neither  in  the  last  analysis  is  it  the
    determinative one.  The Court of Appeal's decision in Lee v SSHD  makes
    plain that separation  may  be  the  consequence  of  serious  criminal
    conduct such as that engaged in by the appellant.  A few  months  after
    lying to secure indefinite leave to remain he organised a very  serious
    offence of supplying crack cocaine.  The Secretary  of  State  attaches
    particular  importance  to  deterring  drug  offending  by   preventive
    measures such as deportation of those liable to it. So have the  courts
    both in the United Kingdom and Strasbourg.  The nature of  the  offence
    is not conclusive against the appellant but it is  a  consideration  of
    considerable weight. The public interest requires us to emphasise  that
    those who use deception to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  and
    then commit very serious offences such as those considered here  cannot
    expect to avoid deportation because they  have  fathered  children  who
    were born here. This is not offending by a young man who grew  up  here
    as a child and has lived here most of his live so it is  not  a  Maslov
    case. Although we have applied the principle of proportionality and not
    exceptionality we consider that deportation is justified in support  in
    of the legitimate aim on the facts of this appeal.

122. Nevertheless, if the appellant  does lead a law  abiding  life  in  the
    future, and if he does maintain contact  with  his  children  and  this
    present partner, it will be open  to  him  to  apply  to  revoke   this
    deportation order at some point in the  future  after   his  return  to
    Jamaica.  Although a deportation order  is  indefinite  and  the  rules
    suggest that a substantial passage of  time  should  elapse  before  an
    order will normally be revoked that is  subject  to  the  principle  of
    proportionality in the light of the state of the  relationship  in  the
    future. We make no observation on his prospects of future success,  but
    it is not the case that deportation in such cases always lasts forever.
     Further we see no reason why the  children  would  need  to  lose  all
    contact with their father if he is returned to Jamaica. The prospect of
    return if  he  maintains  contact  within  his  family,  supports  them
    financially, makes a  regular  application  for  admission  and  ceases
    criminal activity is something to which we have regard in the  exercise
    of the proportionality balance.

Walker
123. Mr Walker has been in the United Kingdom since December 1996, a  period
    of over 15 years, almost all of which has been without leave and a part
    of it spent in custody.  He had previously spent a much greater  period
    - some 25 years  -  in  Jamaica.   The  conviction  that  prompted  the
    Secretary of State to decide to deport him was made as a result of  his
    conviction in 2007 when he was 35 years old.  His  attempts  to  remain
    included contracting a marriage of convenience whilst  in  fact  living
    with his present wife and the mother of his four children, two of  whom
    were born in Jamaica.  When  Sir  Richard  Buxton  gave  permission  to
    appeal the two youngest children were aged 11 and 3 and had  been  born
    in the United Kingdom and are United Kingdom citizens.  In doing so, he
    recognised that it did not necessarily follow in spite of his being  an
    obvious candidate for deportation,  that  the  appellant's  deportation
    could not be stayed, however unmeritoriously, because of its impact  on
    his family. In assessing the impact, he continued, the Tribunal had  to
    consider the practical impact of the deportation decision on the  right
    of abode of the children as British citizens. He spoke of  there  being
    no assumption that a child must forfeit that right as  a  result  of  a
    family decision following from a deportation order. It is on this basis
    that we approach his case.


124. Although he had offended on a number of previous occasions for a  range
    of  offences  dealt  with  without  charge  and  thus   considered   as
    comparatively minor contraventions of the  criminal  law,  the  offence
    which precipitated the decision to deport him was a very  serious  one.
    Like Mr Harrison it involved the supply of  a  Class  A  drug  and  the
    deliberate scheme to distribute it to drug-users  in  Colchester.   The
    episode was described by the sentencing judge as, peddling  in  'misery
    and degradation'. It was not a one-off transaction at the lowest level.
     He did not co-operate with the authorities.

125. Once again, his case rests principally on the  impact  upon  the  three
    children aged 17, 13 and 4. Similar considerations apply to  this  case
    as they apply in the  case  of  Harrison.  The  children  will  not  be
    required to leave the United Kingdom  and  we  would  not  consider  it
    reasonable for them to do so. Zambrano does not impact upon the appeal.
    His wife visited Jamaica for a few days in 2000 and 2006.  None of  the
    children has visited, save Y at a  time  when  she  was  too  young  to
    remember.

126. Notwithstanding the obvious effect upon each of  the  children  of  not
    being able to live with their father, we consider that  deportation  is
    justified on the facts of this case. As in Mr Harrison's case there  is
    no evidence before us to  conclude  that  the  claimant's  presence  is
    needed to prevent the children from being ill treated, their health  or
    development  being  impaired,  or  their  care  other  than  safe   and
    effective. Again visits to Jamaica and  other  forms  of  communication
    appear possible.  We see no reason why all contact would be lost.

127. We also take account of the poor  state  of  health  of  his  wife  and
    mother. The appellant's wife  has  been  diagnosed  as  suffering  from
    multiple early disc degeneration without spinal stenosis but with  what
    was described in 2008 as moderately severe  back  pain.   However,  the
    pain  is  significantly  disabling  resulting  in  her  being   awarded
    Disability Living Allowance at the Higher Rate.  At the earlier hearing
    before Immigration Judge Wright  in  2007,  the  appellant's  wife  was
    suffering from post-natal depression.  The  appellant's  mother-in-law,
    with whom the family are living, suffers from cancer. The appellant and
    his wife are her primary carer.

128. Those factors might well have carried greater  weight  in  the  balance
    but for the absence of any claim for the appellant to remain under  the
    Immigration Rules, his previous  resort to a  marriage  of  convenience
    and the fact that his family members were both aware of his  precarious
    immigration position and his offending. Combined with the  interest  of
    the children they may carry weight in an application for revocation  of
    the deportation order.

    DECISION


    In the case of Sanade the appeal is allowed. In the cases of Walker and
    Harrison the appeals are dismissed.

                     Maslov v Austria (1638/03) [2008] ECHR 546

(a)   General principles
     1. The main issue to be determined is  whether  the  interference  was
        "necessary in a democratic society". The fundamental principles  in
        that regard are well established in the Court's case-law  and  have
        recently been summarised as follows (see �ner, cited above, ��  54-
        55 and 57-58):
         "54. The Court reaffirms at the outset that a State is entitled, as
             a matter  of  international  law  and  subject  to  its  treaty
             obligations, to control the entry of aliens into its  territory
             and their residence there (see, among many  other  authorities,
             Abdulaziz,  Cabales  and  Balkandali  v.  the  United  Kingdom,
             judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, p. 34, � 67, Boujlifa
             v. France, judgment of 21 October 1997,  Reports  of  Judgments
             and Decisions 1997 VI, p. 2264, � 42). The Convention does not
             guarantee the right of an alien to enter  or  to  reside  in  a
             particular  country  and,  in  pursuance  of  their   task   of
             maintaining public order, Contracting States have the power  to
             expel an alien convicted of criminal offences.  However,  their
             decisions in this field must, in so far as they  may  interfere
             with a right protected under paragraph 1 of Article  8,  be  in
             accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic  society,
             that is to say justified by a  pressing  social  need  and,  in
             particular, proportionate to the legitimate  aim  pursued  (see
             Dalia v. France, judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports  1998-I,
             p. 91, � 52; Mehemi v. France, judgment of 26 September  1997,
             Reports 1997-VI, p. 1971, � 34; Boultif v.  Switzerland,  cited
             above, � 46; and Slivenko v. Latvia [GC],  no. 48321/99,  ECHR
             2003-X, � 113).
         55.  The Court considers that these principles apply regardless of
             whether an alien entered the host country as an adult or  at  a
             very young age, or was perhaps even born there. In this context
             the  Court  refers  to  Recommendation  1504  (2001)   on   the
             non expulsion  of  long-term   immigrants,   in   which   the
             Parliamentary Assembly of the  Council  of  Europe  recommended
             that the Committee of Ministers  invite  member  States,  inter
             alia, to guarantee that long-term migrants  who  were  born  or
             raised in  the  host  country  cannot  be  expelled  under  any
             circumstances (see paragraph  37  above).  While  a  number  of
             Contracting States have enacted legislation or  adopted  policy
             rules to the effect that long-term immigrants who were born  in
             those States or who arrived there during early childhood cannot
             be  expelled  on  the  basis  of  their  criminal  record  (see
             paragraph 39 above), such an absolute right not to be  expelled
             cannot, however, be derived from Article 8 of  the  Convention,
             couched, as paragraph 2 of that provision is,  in  terms  which
             clearly allow for exceptions to be made to the  general  rights
             guaranteed in the first paragraph.
             ...
         57.  Even if Article 8 of the Convention does not therefore contain
             an absolute right for any category of alien not to be expelled,
             the  Court's  case law  amply  demonstrates  that  there  are
             circumstances where the expulsion of an alien will give rise to
             a violation of that provision (see, for example, the  judgments
             in Moustaquim v. Belgium, Beldjoudi v. France  and  Boultif  v.
             Switzerland, cited above; see also Amrollahi  v.  Denmark,  no.
             56811/00, 11 July 2002; Y?lmaz v.  Germany,  no.  52853/99,  17
             April 2003; and Keles v. Germany, 32231/02, 27  October  2005).
             In the case  of  Boultif  the  Court  elaborated  the  relevant
             criteria which it would use  in  order  to  assess  whether  an
             expulsion measure was necessary in  a  democratic  society  and
             proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. These criteria, as
             reproduced in paragraph 40 of  the  Chamber  judgment  in  the
             present case, are the following:
             -    the nature and seriousness of the offence committed by the
               applicant;
             -    the length of the applicant's stay  in  the  country  from
               which he or she is to be expelled;
             -    the time elapsed since the offence was committed  and  the
               applicant's conduct during that period;
             -    the nationalities of the various persons concerned;
             -    the applicant's family situation, such as  the  length  of
               the marriage, and other factors expressing the effectiveness
               of a couple's family life;
             -    whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time when
               he or she entered into a family relationship;
             -    whether there are children of the  marriage,  and  if  so,
               their age; and
             -    the seriousness of the difficulties which  the  spouse  is
               likely to encounter in the country to which the applicant is
               to be expelled.
         58.  The Court would wish to make explicit two criteria which  may
             already  be  implicit  in  those  identified  in  the   Boultif
             judgment:
             -    the best interests and  well-being  of  the  children,  in
               particular the seriousness of  the  difficulties  which  any
               children of the applicant are likely  to  encounter  in  the
               country to which the applicant is to be expelled; and
             -    the solidity of social, cultural and family ties with  the
               host country and with the country of destination.
             As to the first point, the Court notes  that  this  is  already
             reflected in its existing case law (see, for  example,  ?en  v.
             the Netherlands, no. 31465/96, � 40, 21 December 2001, Tuquabo-
             Tekle and Others v. the Netherlands,  no.  60665/00,  �  47,  1
             December 2005) and is in line with the Committee of  Ministers'
             Recommendation  Rec(2002)4  on  the  legal  status  of  persons
             admitted for family reunification (see paragraph 38 above).
             As to the second point, it is to be noted  that,  although  the
             applicant in the case of Boultif was already an adult  when  he
             entered Switzerland, the Court has held the 'Boultif  criteria'
             to apply all the  more  so  (�  plus  forte  raison)  to  cases
             concerning applicants who were born in the host country or  who
             moved there at  an  early  age  (see  Mokrani  v.  France,  no.
             52206/99, � 31, 15 July 2003).  Indeed,  the  rationale  behind
             making the duration of a person's stay in the host country  one
             of the elements to be taken into account lies in the assumption
             that the longer a person has  been  residing  in  a  particular
             country the stronger his or her ties with that country and  the
             weaker the ties with the country of his or her nationality will
             be. Seen against that background, it is self-evident  that  the
             Court will have regard to the special situation of  aliens  who
             have spent most, if  not  all,  their  childhood  in  the  host
             country, were brought up there  and  received  their  education
             there."
     1. In the �ner judgment, as well as in the  Boultif  judgment  (�  48)
        cited above, the Court has taken care to establish the  criteria  -
        which were so far implicit in its case-law -  to  be  applied  when
        assessing whether an expulsion measure is necessary in a democratic
        society and proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
     1. The Court would stress that while the criteria  which  emerge  from
        its case-law and are spelled out in the Boultif and �ner  judgments
        are meant to facilitate the application of Article 8  in  expulsion
        cases by  domestic  courts,  the  weight  to  be  attached  to  the
        respective criteria will inevitably vary according to the  specific
        circumstances of each case. Moreover, it has to be  borne  in  mind
        that where, as in the  present  case,  the  interference  with  the
        applicant's rights under Article 8 pursues, as  a  legitimate  aim,
        the "prevention of disorder or crime" (see paragraph 67 above), the
        above criteria ultimately are designed to help evaluate the  extent
        to which the applicant can be expected  to  cause  disorder  or  to
        engage in criminal activities.
     1. In a case like the present one, where the person to be expelled  is
        a young adult who has not yet founded a  family  of  his  own,  the
        relevant criteria are:
             -    the nature and seriousness of the offence committed by the
               applicant;
             -    the length of the applicant's stay  in  the  country  from
               which he or she is to be expelled;
             -    the time elapsed since the offence was committed  and  the
               applicant's conduct during that period;
             -    the solidity of social, cultural and family ties with  the
               host country and with the country of destination.
     1. The Court would also clarify that the age of the  person  concerned
        can play a role when applying  some  of  the  above  criteria.  For
        instance, when assessing the nature and seriousness of the offences
        committed by an applicant, it has to be taken into account  whether
        he or she committed them as a juvenile or as  an  adult  (see,  for
        instance, Moustaquim v. Belgium,  judgment  of  18  February  1991,
        Series A no. 193, p. 19, � 44,  and  Radovanovic  v.  Austria,  no.
        42703/98, � 35, 22 April 2004).
     1. In turn, when assessing the length of the applicant's stay  in  the
        country from which he or she is to be expelled and the solidity  of
        the social, cultural and family ties  with  the  host  country,  it
        evidently makes a  difference  whether  the  person  concerned  had
        already come to the country during his or her childhood  or  youth,
        or was even born there, or whether he or she only came as an adult.
        This tendency is  also  reflected  in  various  Council  of  Europe
        instruments,   in   particular   in    Committee    of    Ministers
        Recommendations Rec (2001)15 and Rec (2002)4 (see paragraphs  34-35
        above).
     1.  Although  Article  8  provides  no  absolute  protection   against
        expulsion for any category of aliens (see �ner, cited above, � 55),
        including those who were born in the host country or moved there in
        their early childhood, the Court has already found that  regard  is
        to be had to the special situation of aliens who have  spent  most,
        if not all, their childhood in the host country,  were  brought  up
        there and received their education there (see �ner, � 58 in fine).
     1. In short, the Court considers that for a settled  migrant  who  has
        lawfully spent all or the major part of his or  her  childhood  and
        youth in the host country very  serious  reasons  are  required  to
        justify expulsion. This  is  all  the  more  so  where  the  person
        concerned committed the offences underlying the  expulsion  measure
        as a juvenile.
     1. Finally, the Court reiterates that  national  authorities  enjoy  a
        certain  margin  of  appreciation   when   assessing   whether   an
        interference with a right protected by Article 8 was necessary in a
        democratic society and proportionate to the legitimate aim  pursued
        (see Slivenko v. Latvia [GC], no. 48321/99, � 113, ECHR 2003 X, and
        Berrehab v. the Netherlands, judgment of 21 June 1988, Series A no.
        138, p. 15, � 28). However, the Court has  consistently  held  that
        its task consists in ascertaining  whether  the  impugned  measures
        struck a fair balance between the relevant  interests,  namely  the
        individual's rights protected by the Convention on the one hand and
        the community's interests on  the  other  (see,  among  many  other
        authorities, Boultif, cited above, � 47). Thus, the State's  margin
        of appreciation  goes  hand  in  hand  with  European  supervision,
        embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it,  even
        those given by an independent court (see, mutatis mutandis, Soci�t�
        Colas Est and Others v. France, no. 37971/97, � 47, ECHR 2002-III).
        The Court is therefore  empowered  to  give  the  final  ruling  on
        whether an expulsion measure is reconcilable with Article 8.



-----------------------
[1] As this decision was about to be promulgated, we became aware of the
decision of the Court of Appeal in SSHD v Gurung [2012] EWCA Civ 62 where
it said at [12]
    The tribunal should accordingly entertain both sides' submissions on
    the public interest, along with such elements as the nature and gravity
    of the offence; but the fact that one estimation of the public interest
    (or of any other element) is the home Secretary's, whether leaning
    towards or against deportation in the particular case, commands no
    additional weight.  To let it do so as counsel for the Home Secretary
    have implicitly recognised would be to upset the equal footing on which
    the Crown and the individual come before this country's tribunals and
    courts, not least when Parliament has already decided where, other
    things being equal, the public interest lies.  It would also impinge on
    the independence and impartiality of the tribunal by requiring it to
    defer to one side's judgment of a material question.
[2]68^fWe understand this to be consistent with the approach we adopt.
[3] The Upper Tribunal has recently considered the application of these
principles in a case where a serious offender came to the United Kingdom as
a young man, see Masih [2012] UKUT 00046 (IAC)

require revocation.
