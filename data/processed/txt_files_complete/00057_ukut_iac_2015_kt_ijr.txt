Introduction


JUDGE GOLDSTEIN: The applicant brings an application for judicial review  of
    the respondent's decision dated 15 April 2014 in which  the  respondent
    refused the applicant's application for leave to remain in  the  United
    Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant.   The  application  was
    refused because leave to remain had been curtailed to 12  October  2012
    and accordingly the application dated 23 January 2014 was more than  28
    days after the expiry of the applicant's previous leave.


2.       The applicant claims that the curtailment notice  dated  13  August
    2012 was ineffective in light of Syed (curtailment of leave  -  notice)
    [2013] UKUT 00144 (IAC).  He maintains that he had valid leave until 30
    April 2014 and that accordingly his application for leave to remain was
    made in time.


3.       Permission to bring these proceedings was granted on 30  July  2014
    by Upper Tribunal Judge Peter Lane on the basis  that  in  reliance  on
    Syed  the  applicant  asserted  that  he  did  not  receive  notice  of
    curtailment and that:


         'In the absence of a reply by the respondent to the PAP letter  and
         acknowledgement of service, the point is arguable'.


4.       At the outset of the hearing before me on  19  January  2015  there
    was no appearance on the part of the applicant, no explanation for  his
    absence and no request for an adjournment.  I was satisfied and  indeed
    having checked, that the applicant was properly served with the  notice
    of  hearing  by  this  Tribunal  on  19  November   2014.    In   those
    circumstances I was invited by Ms Walker to proceed with the hearing in
    his absence and saw no reason why I should not do so.





Factual Background


5.       On 31 July 2014 the respondent filed and served an  acknowledgement
    of service and summary grounds of defence in which she  explained  that
    the applicant's judicial review was  an  abuse  of  process  since  the
    ground on which the applicant relied had already been adjudicated upon.


6.       Upon receipt of the grant  of  permission  on  5  August  2014  the
    Treasury Solicitor wrote to the Tribunal further  explaining  that  the
    point  under  challenge  in  this  judicial  review  had  already  been
    litigated through to an oral hearing in the Administrative Court  under
    reference CO/5577/2013 and had already been  heard  by  the  court  and
    found to be unarguable.


7.       In that regard there is before me the decision on the papers of  Mr
    Justice Hickinbotton in which he had this to say:


         "The claimant seeks to challenge the Secretary of State's  decision
         of 1 May 2013 setting  removal  directions.   He  relied  upon  two
         grounds.


         First, he says that the curtailment of his leave to  remain  on  13
         August 2012 (effective 12 October 2012) was ineffective, because he
         did not receive notice of it.  However, the Secretary of State  was
         entitled to conclude  that  he  did  receive  it,  given  (i)  when
         encountered the claimant accepted that the address to which it  was
         sent was his home until December 2012, (ii)  the  notice  was  sent
         there by recorded delivery in August 2012, and (iii)  the  claimant
         accepts he knew that the college's licence had  been  suspended  in
         November 2012 and that the college had been shut down  by  February
         2013 but took no steps to regularise his position or  find/register
         with another college.  From that, I would draw the same conclusion.


         Second he submits his Article 8 [rights] would be breached if he is
         removed.  However, there is no evidence upon which  an  independent
         Tribunal could find that the  removal  of  the  claimant  from  the
         United Kingdom was a disproportionate interference with the Article
         8 rights of either the claimant or  anyone  else.   The  Article  8
         claim, is legally hopeless.


         For those reasons I do not consider either ground arguable."


8.       The applicant orally renewed  his  application  for  permission  to
    apply for judicial review, in relation to which there is before me  the
    Order of the Administrative Court dated 17 January 2014 when  following
    the hearing of the applicant's renewed oral application for  permission
    before David Pittaway QC (sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge) it  was
    ordered that permission be refused  and  that  the  applicant  pay  the
    respondent's  costs  in  respect  of  the  acknowledgement  of  service
    summarily assessed in the sum of �320.


Discussion


9.       In R (Opoku) v Southwark College Principal (QBD) [2002]  EWHC  2092
    (Admin) it was held inter alia that although the common law doctrine of
    res judicata did  not  preclude  a  fresh  application,  "...  a  fresh
    application unless based on fresh material, may constitute an abuse  of
    process".


10.      In the present case the applicant has adduced no new  evidence  and
    provided no fresh material to support his claim not to have received  a
    notice of curtailment.  In consequence, I have  had  no  hesitation  in
    concluding that the application of the doctrine of res judicata and the
    principles outlined in Opoku (above) clearly apply  in  the  particular
    circumstances of this case and that the applicant's  present  claim  of
    lack of effective service can only be viewed as an abuse of process.


11.      I find it to be of particular concern that the applicant chose  not
    to draw to the Tribunal's attention the fact  that  the  Administrative
    Court had found against him upon exactly the ground upon which  he  now
    relies.








Decision


12.       For  the  above  reasons,  this  claim  for  judicial  review   is
    dismissed.


Costs


13.      For like reason I grant Ms Walker's application that the  applicant
    be ordered to pay the respondent's costs of resisting  the  claim  that
    includes the drafting of detailed grounds of defence and attending  the
    hearing.


14.      In that regard there is before me a schedule of costs  prepared  by
    the respondent a copy of which I am told, was sent to the applicant  on
    Friday 16 January 2015.  Ms Walker has informed me most fairly that due
    to the applicant's non-attendance at the hearing today both she and her
    instructing Treasury Solicitor have agreed to reduce  their  respective
    fees of attendance that was previously based on two hours but will  now
    be based on 45 minutes.  Therefore I am informed, that  the  attendance
    of Counsel's Treasury Solicitor will now be reduced  from  the  sum  of
    �380 to the sum of �120, that being a reduction of �260.


15.      Ms Walker has told me that she would have been at the Tribunal  for
    at least one hour by the time the hearing before me  concludes  and  in
    such circumstances she has decided to reduce her fees  by  the  sum  of
    �80.


16.      Having made these reductions from the original figure submitted  of
    �2,524 the sum now sought will be �2,184 exclusive of VAT and with  VAT
    added of �104 the total due will be �2,288.


17.      I have decided that in  view  of  what  I  have  found  to  be  the
    hopelessness of the applicant's claim and the abuse of process  that  I
    have identified above I grant and order the respondent's costs  in  the
    sum of �2,288.


18.      I will thus make this costs order as an interim one so that  I  can
    allow the applicant the opportunity to raise objections to it (if  any)
    within seven days of the date of service  of  this  judgment.   In  the
    absence of such representations within that time the  order  for  costs
    will become absolute.


Permission to Appeal


19.      Although no application has been made for permission to  appeal  to
    the Court of Appeal having considered this issue for  myself  as  I  am
    required to  do  by  Rule  44(4B)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008, for the reasons already given I refuse  to  grant
    such permission.~~~~0~~~~
