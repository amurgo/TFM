|    |The Secretary of State for the Home Department           |Respondent   |


                                  DECISION

 1. This is a decision on the papers without a hearing pursuant to paras  4
    and 5 of the Senior President's "Pilot Practice Direction:  Contingency
    Arrangements in the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal"  (hereafter
    the "PPD"), issued on 19 March 2020 on a pilot basis for  a  period  of
    six months and extended subsequently for a further six months until  18
    March 2021, and rule 34 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008.

 2. By my Directions dated 27 November 2020  (sent  to  the  parties  on  2
    December 2020 (hereafter the "December  2020  Directions")  and  having
    considered the judgment of Fordham  J  in  R  (Joint  Council  for  the
    Welfare of Immigrants) v President of the Upper  Tribunal  (Immigration
    and Asylum Chamber) [2020]  EWHC  3103  (Admin),  I  indicated  to  the
    parties my provisional view concerning the appropriate disposal of  the
    appellant's appeal. I gave reasons for my provisional view at  paras  2
    and 3 of the December 2020 Directions. At para 4, I stated that  I  was
    therefore minded to make a decision without a hearing:

      (i)   that Judge Skehan materially erred in law and that her  decision
        should be set aside in its entirety; and

      (ii)  that the appeal should be remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        for a Judge of that Tribunal other than Judge Skehan to re-make the
        decision on the appellant's appeal on the merits on all issues.

 3. At para 5, I stated my view that it was therefore unnecessary to hold a
    hearing of this appeal in the Upper Tribunal in order to decide whether
    the decision of Judge Skehan should be set aside.

 4. I then issued directions which gave the parties an opportunity to  make
    submissions and/or object to my provisional view,  having  drawn  their
    attention to the judgment in R (JCWI).

 5. Neither party made any  submissions  or  objected  within  the  periods
    specified in the December 2020 Directions.  Nor have any objections  or
    submissions been received to date.

 6. I have considered afresh whether it is appropriate to proceed to decide
    this appeal without a hearing under rule 34. Fordham  J  did  not  find
    that the PPD was unlawful. Furthermore, the judgment in  R  (JCWI)  did
    not concern cases  in  which  the  Upper  Tribunal  has  indicated  its
    provisional view(s) concerning the disposal of the appeal  and  invited
    submissions/objections, which is the subject of paras 4-5 of the PPD.

 7. For the reasons given at paras 2-3 of the December 2020  Directions,  I
    am satisfied that Judge Skehan materially erred in  law  and  that  her
    decision should be set aside in its  entirety.  Having  considered  the
    issues to be decided in this appeal, including the issues identified by
    Upper Tribunal  Judge  Rintoul  at  paras  2-3  of  his  "Memorandum  &
    Directions" dated 16 September 2020, I  am  satisfied  that  this  case
    falls within para 7.2(b) of the Practice Statements for the Immigration
    and Asylum Chambers of the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal.

 8. I therefore remit this appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for a Judge of
    that Tribunal other than Judge Skehan to re-make the  decision  on  the
    appeal on the merits on all issues.

DECISION

 9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making  of  errors
    on points of law such that the decision is set aside in  its  entirety.
    The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a Judge  of  that
    Tribunal other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Skehan to  re-make
    the decision on the appeal on the merits on all issues.
