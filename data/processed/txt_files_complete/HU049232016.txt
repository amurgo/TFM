For the Appellant:     Mr Khalid Gill, Gill Law Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. First-tier Tribunal Beach granted Ms Aslam permission to appeal the
        decision of First-tier Tribunal judge Kelly who had  dismissed  her
        human rights appeal following the refusal of  her  application  for
        Entry Clearance as the spouse of her British sponsor.


     2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Kelly  found  that  the  appellant  had
        submitted the documents  required  to  meet  the  criteria  in  the
        Immigration Rules. He also found that the sponsor's income was more
        than the required ï¿½18,600.  Those  findings  were  not  subject  to
        challenge. For some unexplained  reason  the  judge  dismissed  the
        appeal.

     3. Mr Duffy accepted, correctly, that the judge had failed to  make  a
        clear reasoned finding for dismissing the appeal and  that  such  a
        failure amounted to a material  error  of  law.  I  set  aside  the
        decision to be remade, such findings as First-tier  Tribunal  judge
        Kelly had made retained.

     4. Mr Duffy submitted that there could be scenarios where the relevant
        documents had been submitted but  for  some  reason  they  did  not
        illustrate with sufficient  precision  that  the  criteria  in  the
        Immigration Rules were met; even though  income  was  shown  to  be
        sufficient, if the requirements of the  Rules  were  not  met  this
        would not necessarily render a decision to refuse  a  human  rights
        application  disproportionate  absent   some   compelling   reason.
        However, he accepted that this was not such a case. In  this  case,
        the appellant had submitted the required documents, as found by the
        judge, and the income was above the required level, as found by the
        judge.

     5. I allow the appeal.



          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

     I set aside the decision

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.
