                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Siaw, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Mr Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I do not make an anonymity direction.

 2. The appellant is  a  Pakistani  national.   The  appellant  applied  on
    January 14, 2016 for a residence card as the extended family member  of
    an EEA national under Regulations 8 and 17 of the Immigration (European
    Economic Area) 2006. The respondent refused this application on July 5,
    2016.

 3. The  appellant  lodged  grounds  of  appeal  on  July  18,  2016  under
    Regulation 26  of  the  2006  Regulations  and  Section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  His appeal  came  before
    Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Khawar  (hereinafter  called  "the
    Judge") on September 22, 2017 and in a decision promulgated on  October
    5, 2017 the Judge found there was no jurisdiction to  hear  the  appeal
    relying on Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC).

 4. The appellant appealed the decision on October 20, 2017. Permission  to
    appeal was granted by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Chohan  on
    November 1, 2017 on the basis of the Court of Appeal decision in Khan v
    SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.

 5. The matter came before me on  the  above  date  and  the  parties  were
    represented as set out above.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUE

 6. Both Mr Nath and Mr Siaw indicated that they had discussed the case and
    submitted that this appeal should be adjourned pending the decision  by
    the Supreme Court in SM (Algeria) v Entry Clearance Officer  which  was
    due to address the rights of appeal to  extended  family  members.  The
    decision was imminent albeit no  date  for  the  handing  down  of  the
    decision had been announced.

 7. I indicated to both representatives that I had  two  options  today.  I
    could either follow their suggested path or  I  could  simply  find  an
    error in law and remit the case back  to  the  First-tier  where  these
    issues could be  properly  argued.  In  the  event  the  Supreme  Court
    endorsed the views of the Court of Appeal a substantive  hearing  could
    then take place whereas if the Supreme Court upheld the view  expressed
    by the Upper Tribunal in Sala then the  First-tier  Tribunal  would  be
    able to deal with the matter on the basis there was no jurisdiction.  I
    indicated that the second option was my preferred option in the absence
    of any blanket stay on such applications.

 8. Both representatives agreed with my suggestion and I found an error  in
    law for the reason argued in the grounds of appeal.

    DECISION

 9. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.  I  set  aside  the  decision.  I
    remit the decision to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard  by  a  Judge
    other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Khawar.

Signed                              Date     19/01/2018
