                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
Background


   1. The appellants are citizens of the DRC. The  first  appellant  is  the
      third appellant's mother and  the  second  appellant  is  the  adopted
      daughter of the sponsor's real brother.  They  applied  for  leave  to
      enter the United Kingdom as  the  dependents  of  the  sponsor  Ngamba
      Masieta. Their applications were refused on the  1  March  2012.  They
      appealed that decision and their appeals  were  dismissed  on  the  23
      April by First-Tier Tribunal Judge Thomas (the FTJ) as she found  that
      the marriage between the first  appellant  and  the  sponsor  was  not
      subsisting. They applied for permission to appeal which was granted by
      FTJ Hemmingway on the 5 June 2013.

The Hearing

   2. The appeal came before us on the 1 July 2013 and was on submissions as
      to error of law only.


   3.  Ms Rutherford relied on the grounds of appeal which are  attached  to
      her instructing solicitors  letter  of  the  23  May  2013  which  she
      expanded by further oral submissions as to errors of law in the  FTJ's
      determination. We heard submissions  from  Ms  Pleass  who  made  oral
      submissions that the FTJ finding that the marriage was not  subsisting
      was open to her on the evidence. We reserved our decision which we now
      give.


Discussion


   4. The grounds of appeal  are  lengthy  but  the  appellant's  solicitors
      letter of the 23 May contains a summary in which they contend that the
      FTJ's "key finding that  the  marriage  was  not  subsisting  was  the
      corollary of her finding that the first appellant did  not  intend  to
      live permanently with the sponsor.  She  made  no  assessment  of  the
      sponsor's intention vis-ï¿½-vis the marriage. Her failure to assess  his
      intention as an error of law especially given that  it  is  normal  in
      entry clearance appeals,  the  sponsor  gave  oral  evidence  and  the
      appellant did not".


   5. We do not accept that contention because as  we  pointed  out  at  the
      hearing it is essential that for  a  marriage  to  be  subsisting  the
      matrimonial  relationship  must  exist  (see  the  head  note  to  Naz
      (subsisting marriage -standard of proof) Pakistan [2012]  UKUT  40.  A
      "relationship" necessarily implies that if one party is found (in this
      case the appellant) not  to  have  the  necessary  intention  to  live
      together as spouses then the marriage is not subsisting. That is  what
      the FTJ found and that was within the range of findings  the  FTJ  was
      entitled to make on the on the evidence. We are satisfied that the FTJ
      considered all of the evidence with the degree of care  required.  The
      foregoing leads to the second ground of appeal.


   6. The second ground  of  appeal  is  that  "The  finding  regarding  the
      appellant's intention was in any event flawed by the IJ's approach  to
      the evidence and was illogical (the IJ held it against  her  that  she
      had not applied to remain here following visits in 2008 and 2009;  her
      decision to abide by the terms of her visit visa and return to the DRC
      to look after her children does not suggest that  she  now  wishes  to
      emigrate to the UK for economic reasons, as is  implied.  Moreover  it
      was based on incidents that were four /five years old at the  time  of
      the hearing.


   7. We note the use of the word "illogical" and Ms Rutherford did  not  in
      her submissions suggest the IJ's decision  was  perverse.  We  further
      note the reliance on GA (subsisting marriage) Ghana  UKAIT  00046  but
      for the reasons given above at paragraph 5 we do not accept that  both
      grounds "fall foul "of GA.


   8. Having dealt with the two principal grounds of appeal we turn  to  the
      detailed grounds. Paragraphs 7 to 11 set out what are contended to  be
      material errors of law.


   9. Paragraph 7 asks the hypothetical  question  as  to  why  the  sponsor
      persists in the process at expense to himself if he  did  not  believe
      that the appellant to be committed to the  marriage.  It  is  not  our
      function to answer such questions as it is for the appellant  and  the
      sponsor to satisfy the FTJ as  to  their  mutual  intentions.  As  was
      recognised in GA it is a difficult  problem  which  First-Tier  Judges
      "must grapple with ". This is what the FTJ did and we  find  that  her
      findings of fact were open to her for the extensive reasons  she  gave
      at paragraphs 17 (a) to (g).


  10. Paragraph 8 relates evidence before the FTJ regarding the  whereabouts
      of the sponsor's wedding ring. We do not see  the  logical  connection
      between this and the reference to his commitment  to  his  wife  being
      questioned and this in our view is simply a repetition of the  primary
      contentions as to mutual intention which we have dealt with above.


  11. Paragraphs 9 and 10 amount to no more than  a  disagreement  with  the
      FTJ's findings of fact and the  weight  which  the  FTJ  gave  to  the
      evidence before her and an attempt to reargue the case.  They  do  not
      identify an arguable error of law.


  12. The draftsman of the grounds would do well to read the decision of  LJ
      Coombe in VW Sri Lanka [2013] EWCA 0522 in particular at [12] where it
      is stated.


        Regrettably, there is an increasing tendency in immigration  cases,
        when a First-tier Tribunal Judge has given  a  judgment  explaining
        why he has reached a particular decision, of seeking to burrow  out
        industriously areas of evidence that have  been  less  fully  dealt
        with than others and then to use this as a  basis  for  saying  the
        judge's decision is legally flawed because it did not deal  with  a
        particular matter more fully.  In my judgment, with  respect,  that
        is no basis on which to sustain a proper  challenge  to  a  judge's
        finding of fact.


  13.  Finally it is significant that despite their length  the  grounds  of
      appeal they do not challenge the FTJ's finding at paragraph 19 of  the
      determination that the financial requirements of paragraph  281  (iii)
      nor the requirement for sole responsibility in Paragraph 281 (v)  were
      not met. The decision that Article 8 family life did not exist was not
      challenged. For these reasons alone the appeal before  the  FTJ  could
      not succeed.

  Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

      We do not set aside the decision
