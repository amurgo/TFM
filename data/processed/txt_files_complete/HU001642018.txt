Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Turner, Counsel, Law Lane Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Presenting Officer


                     DECISION BY CONSENT AND DIRECTIONS

 1. Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and by the consent of the parties the following order is made:

      i) Upon the parties' agreement that the  decision  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal promulgated on 19th November  2018  discloses  a  material
         error of law, it is hereby ordered by consent as follows.

     ii) The First-tier Tribunal Judge made errors of law in relation to the
         complaints made in the Grounds of Appeal in the following  respects
         as agreed by the parties:

          a) As stated  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  McWilliam  in  granting
             permission to appeal, when  the  Appellant's  judicial  review
             claim came before Lady Justice  Arden  by  way  of  a  renewed
             permission hearing seeking permission to appeal to that Court,
             her Ladyship was of the view in her judgment dated 30 November
             2017 that the Secretary of State's decision  of  8  July  2015
             represented a "substantive" consideration of  the  Appellant's
             human rights claim and was not a decision under paragraph  353
             (thus explicitly accepting the fresh  claim  and  reaching  an
             adverse conclusion).  As such permission to appeal against the
             refusal to move  for  judicial  review  was  refused  by  Lady
             Justice Arden because there was in  her  view  an  alternative
             remedy,  namely  a  statutory  appeal  before  the  First-tier
             Tribunal.  This is  a  course  of  action  that  her  Ladyship
             appears to have been encouraged to take  by  Mr  Turner,  whom
             represented the appellant on that occasion also  and  appeared
             as counsel before the Court.

          b) In my view, and as agreed by the parties, it is  unclear  from
             ï¿½9 of First-tier Tribunal Judge Beg's decision why it has been
             concluded  that  there  was  no   valid   right   of   appeal,
             particularly in the light of  the  binding  judgment  of  Lady
             Justice Arden of 30 November 2017 that there may well be.

          c) Notwithstanding the decision of Secretary  of  State  for  the
             Home Department v VM (Jamaica) [2017] EWCA Civ 255 at [27]  to
             [29] wherein the Court of Appeal (in a panel composed of  Lady
             Justice Arden and Lord  Justice  Sales)  made  findings  in  a
             matter which appeared to be similar on its face to that in the
             instant appeal, given the judgment of Lady Justice Arden of 30
             November 2017 and the pronouncement by her that there  was  an
             alternative remedy to judicial review in the form of  a  right
             of appeal, the First-tier Tribunal needs to give consideration
             as to whether a valid right of appeal arises as a  consequence
             of the refusal of 9th July 2015 further  to  the  decision  of
             Lady Justice Arden.

          d) I was asked to note by the parties that  the  refusal  of  9th
             July 2015 noted at paragraphs 21 and 32 internally that  there
             was "no realistic prospect of  success".   I  also  note  that
             there was no "certification" of the decision either.

          e) For my part, I  am  unclear  as  to  whether  the  substantive
             consideration of 8th July 2015 puts  this  matter  beyond  the
             remit of paragraph 353 and implicitly creates  a  fresh  claim
             having  a  realistic  prospect  of  success.    I   say   this
             particularly in light of the decision from the  Supreme  Court
             in Robinson (formerly JR (Jamaica)) v Secretary of  State  for
             the Home Department [2019] UKSC 11, promulgated only today.

          f) However, happily that is not a matter for me to decide but  is
             a matter for the First-tier Tribunal to consider upon remittal
             of these proceedings.

 2. As a consequence of the above agreed errors arising from  the  lack  of
    reasons given in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, the  decision
    is set aside in  its  entirety  and  is  remitted  to  be  heard  by  a
    differently constituted bench.

 3. The Appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is therefore allowed.

 4. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for legal error by
    consent.

Directions

 5.  I  make  the  following  directions  for  the  continuation  of  these
    proceedings upon remittal to the First-tier Tribunal for  determination
    of the preliminary issue as to whether there is a valid right of appeal
    or not:

      1) The appeal is to be remitted to be heard by the Resident  Judge  of
         IAC Taylor House (or a judge of similar seniority), in  order  that
         the First-tier Tribunal can determine  whether  there  is  a  valid
         right of appeal or not, as a consequence of the  judgment  of  Lady
         Justice Arden of 30 November 2017.

      2) The time estimate given for the preliminary matter is at least  one
         hour (given that the validity of the appeal may be a matter of some
         complexity and require more time  than  a  Case  Management  Review
         hearing might, for example).

      3) It is a matter for the First-tier Tribunal as to whether  it  lists
         this matter merely for consideration of the preliminary point as to
         the validity of the appeal or whether it also lists this matter for
         substantive hearing thereafter (i.e. a de facto rolled  up  hearing
         if you will).

      4) In relation to any substantive hearing that may follow, I  am  told
         that no interpreter is required.

      5) There is no indication at present as to  the  number  of  witnesses
         that may be called.

      6) No further directions have been requested.

Anonymity

 6. No anonymity direction has been requested and I do not see  any  reason
    why one should be given.
