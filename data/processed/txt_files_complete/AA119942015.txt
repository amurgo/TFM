For the Respondent:    Mr A Reza, Counsel instructed by Sultan Lloyd
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  Secretary  of
    State and the Respondent is referred to as the Claimant.
2.   In a decision promulgated on 26 May 2016 I decided  that  the  Original
    Tribunal's decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge Ferguson  (the  judge)
    had contained an error of law in proceeding to consider the  Article  8
    claim outside of the Rules without an analysis to justify doing so.  On
    this basis that part of the Original Tribunal's decision did not  stand
    and the matter should be remade.

3.   I gave directions.  Those on behalf of the Claimant were  not  complied
    with but  Mr  Whitwell  agreed,  at  my  invitation,  to  look  at  the
    additional material provided in a witness statement of the Claimant,  a
    supporting letter from Ms Tina Baker of Northamptonshire County Council
    and [DR], the foster  parent  of  the  Claimant.   In  considering  the
    submissions made by Mr Reza I have borne in mind the contents of  those
    statements to see whether they necessarily raise matters which fall  at
    this stage to be considered or are pertinent to identifying exceptional
    circumstances in looking at this matter outside of the Rules.

4.   Mr Reza identifies four points which he  says  collectively  amount  to
    the kind of compelling circumstances or exceptional circumstances which
    justify the consideration of Article 8 outside of the Rules.  First, in
    brief that the Claimant has since he entered the  United  Kingdom  been
    lawfully in the United Kingdom; Secondly, there has been a  failure  of
    the Secretary of State in carrying out tracing of  relatives;  Thirdly,
    there has been a period of unwarranted delay in dealing with the claim;
    Fourthly, the issue of the Claimant's foster family and a family in the
    UK whereas apparently he  may  not  have  one  in  Afghanistan  was  an
    important material circumstance.

5.   Without doing injustice to those arguments  in  not  setting  them  out
    more extensively it seemed to me that Mr Reza does raise  circumstances
    which are of obvious importance to the Claimant who does  not  wish  to
    return to Afghanistan and would rather stay in the United Kingdom where
    he has been since 2012.

6.   I have in considering this matter fully taken into account the  finding
    and reasoning of the judge and consider return to  Afghanistan  in  the
    context where there is no remaining claim under the Refugee  Convention
    or under the Humanitarian Protection  provisions  nor  in  relation  to
    Articles 2 and 3 ECHR.

7.   Given the judge's findings which also bear on the need  for  subsidiary
    protection it seemed to me that I approach these circumstances  of  the
    Article 8 claim in the reality that the Claimant is an Afghan  who  has
    at a young age relatively speaking left his home country and now  faces
    a return to what remains unsettled circumstances.  However the fact  of
    his lawful presence in the United Kingdom  is  essentially  neutral  in
    terms of the consideration of  this  matter.   Similarly  the  lack  of
    tracing is now a matter long past, even assuming had it been done at an
    earlier stage it might have produced a result.  In any event  the  case
    law on the  lack  of  tracing  is  not  intended  to  be  punitive  nor
    determinative of the need for protection: A matter which was ultimately
    dealt with in the general asylum/Humanitarian Protection claim that has
    been considered.

8.   Further, it seemed to me in light of EB (Kosovo) v SSHD [2008] UKHL  41
    that the delay is not of particular significance in terms of length  of
    time and it does not appear to me that there has been significant delay
    by the Secretary of State nor that the Claimant has acted  in  reliance
    upon delay to his disadvantage or prejudice.  Nor has  he  changed  his
    position vis-ï¿½-vis what he has done in the United  Kingdom  reliant  on
    delay or the inactivity of the Secretary of State.

9.   Finally the issue of the  Claimant's  foster  family  is  a  matter  of
    obvious concern in the general sense to a claim in relation to  removal
    but it seemed to me that at the age he is now the issue of removal from
    a foster family, with whom he does not presently live, its significance
    diminishes albeit they will  have  provided  valuable  support  in  the
    earlier years of being fostered after 2012.

10.  In those circumstances I conclude that the Secretary of  State  rightly
    identified that for reasons given  the  Claimant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and it did not seem  to  me  that
    these circumstances indicate that  the  Rules  are  not  sufficient  to
    provide for claimants who have a sustainable basis for doing  so.   The
    basis to do so is set by the Secretary of State and Parliament  and  it
    is not for me to traduce it.  In those circumstances  I  have  decided,
    having considered the arguments that this is a case where I do not find
    the  circumstances  have  that  compelling  quality  that  amounts   to
    exceptional circumstances to consider the matter outside of the Rules.
11.    I  should  emphasise  that  I  do  not   require   those   compelling
    circumstances to meet a high threshold. The  case  law  indicates,  for
    example in SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 397,  MM  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985,
    Agyarko [2017] UKSC11, that they should  be  the  kind  of  exceptional
    circumstances that compel the engagement with Article 8 ECHR..

NOTICE OF DECISION
