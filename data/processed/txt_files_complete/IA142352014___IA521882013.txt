                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr D Bazini, Counsel; Pennington Manches Solicitors
For the Claimant: Mr L Tarlow, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    O'Garro, dismissing the Appellants' appeals  against  the  Respondent's
    decisions of 22 November 2013 refusing them indefinite leave to remain,
    and challenging removal directions under section 47 of the Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.






 2.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated  its  decision  dismissing  the
    Appellant's appeal against that decision on 28 July 2014. Subsequently,
    that decision was appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  Upper
    Tribunal. Both the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  Upper  Tribunal  refused
    permission to appeal. The Appellant then brought a judicial  review  of
    the Upper Tribunal's refusal to grant permission to appeal pursuant  to
    Civil Procedure Rule 54.7A (commonly known as a "Cart" judicial review,
    so popularly named after the Supreme Court  authority  of  Cart  v  The
    Upper Tribunal [2011]  UKSC  28).  That  judicial  review  came  before
    Simler, J and was unsuccessful; however, that may or may not have  been
    because a draft consent order agreeing the  settlement  of  that  claim
    which was not placed before the Administrative Court. Matters moved  on
    and the appeal came before Richards, LJ at the Court of  Appeal,  Civil
    Division, whom granted permission to apply for judicial review  on  the
    papers sealed  on  27  July  2015;  and  remitted  the  matter  to  the
    Administrative Court whereby the parties could either proceed with  the
    claim.






 3. Ultimately, the parties entered into a  form  of  consent  whereby  the
    decision of the Upper Tribunal refusing the claimants' applications for
    permission to appeal was set aside.  Thereafter  the  original  grounds
    along with the skeleton argument lodged on behalf of the claimants' and
    referred to by Richards, LJ were placed before the  Vice  President  of
    the Upper Tribunal, Judge Ockelton, whom in light  of  those  materials
    and the arguments raised on the appellants' behalf  extended  time  and
    granted permission to appeal by way of  a  decision  dated  3  November
    2015.






 4. The key grounds of appeal may be summarised as follows:


      i) It is arguable that the judge erred in considering  paragraph  276A
         in determining the issue of whether the Appellants had  two  breaks
         in their continuous residence  for  the  requisite  10-year  period
         matters no relevant to the issue,  particularly  as  it  was  never
         suggested by the Respondent that the Appellant and his British wife
         are not in a genuine and subsisting relationship and  as  they  are
         now expecting their first child; and


     ii) It is arguable that the judge erred in considering the  Appellant's
         Article 8 rights.





 5. The Appellants relied upon the skeleton argument before  the  Court  of
    Appeal as well as the grounds seeking permission  to  appeal  from  the
    Upper Tribunal. The Appellants  also  produced  through  their  counsel
    copies of the following items which were read  by  all  parties  before
    submissions began:


      i) Paragraphs 29-34 of the Immigration Rules,


     ii) Annex A of the  Home  Office's  Highly  Skilled  Migrant  Programme
         (HSMP): Guidance for Applicants Version 2.0 valid from 07.11.06,


    iii) Kaur (Entry Clearance - date of application) India [2013] UKUT 381,


     iv) Anufrijeva, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for  the
         Home Department & Anor [2003] UKHL 36,


      v) Alvi, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
         Department [2012] UKSC 33,


     vi) Long Residence and Private Life Guidance v11.0 valid from 11.11.13,
         and


    vii) Tier 1 (General) Policy Guidance valid from 06.04.10.






 6. The Respondent filed a Rule 24  Reply  dated  30  December  2015  which
    stated that the gaps in the appellants' lawful leave were considered by
    the First-tier Tribunal and were properly reasoned and not vitiated  by
    error of law; and there  was  furthermore  no  error  in  her  decision
    pursuant to Article 8.






 7. I was addressed at great length  by  counsel  for  the  Appellants.  In
    reply, Mr Tarlow sought only to rely upon the Rule 24 Reply and made no
    further submissions or rebuttal in respect of any of the points made by
    Mr Bazini.





    Error of Law


 8. At the close of submissions, I indicated that I did find  an  error  of
    law and would remake the Appellants' appeals allowing  them  with  full
    reasons to follow. My reasons for so finding are as follows.






 9. The sole live issue raised under  paragraph  276A  of  the  Immigration
    Rules  by  the  Respondent  related  to  whether  the  Appellants   had
    continuous lawful leave  for  a  continuous  10-year  period.  In  this
    regard, the Respondent had raised two periods in the first  Appellant's
    stay. The first Appellant arrived in the UK on 21 September 2001 and it
    was asserted that the first break in her leave was (i)  from  12  April
    2007 to 26 March 2008, and (ii) 1 May 2010 to  26  July  2010.  It  was
    asserted by Mr Bazini for the Appellants that the second Appellant  had
    produced evidence of living in the UK for 10 years prior to 1 May 2010,
    but  that  the  judge  failed  to  address  this.  I  did  not  receive
    submissions from the Respondent on this point, but it  matters  not  in
    view of the outcome. The two alleged gaps in the Appellants' leave were
    duly noted by the judge in her decision at �48 and she was  well  aware
    of them.






10. In relation to the first alleged gap, the Appellants  made  an  in-time
    application to extend their stay in the UK on 26 February  2007.  There
    were insufficient funds to cover the application fee and  as  such  the
    Respondent deemed the application invalid/withdrawn on 11  April  2007.
    On that date, the Respondent wrote to the first Appellant and  informed
    her that her application was invalid and returned her documentation  to
    her.






11. As an aside, I queried with Mr Bazini whether this application extended
    the first Appellant's section 3C leave under the Immigration Act  1971.
    Mr Bazini stated that it did not matter given  that  the  rejection  of
    their application was never served upon them  and  consequently,  there
    was no notice of any decision and  given  that  the  Respondent  had  a
    policy in place at  the  time  which  allowed  applicants  28  days  to
    resubmit their applications  even  had  the  decisions  been  delivered
    (which they were not) which would allow the applications to be  treated
    as in time. This is identical to the summary made by the judge  at  �54
    of her decision. It  is  clear  that  the  judge  disagreed  with  this
    submission for reasons she gives at ��55-61 of her decision.






12. Dealing with each of those  in  turn,  Mr  Bazini  submitted  that  the
    judge's reliance on Kaur (Entry Clearance - date of application)  India
    [2013] UKUT 381 at �56 was a material error as Kaur discusses paragraph
    30 of the Immigration Rules, which was not in issue at all  because  it
    concerns applications for  entry  clearance  as  opposed  to  leave  to
    remain. Having studied the rule, it is clear that Mr  Bazini  is  right
    that the rule has nothing to do with in-country applications at all and
    was wholly irrelevant to this issue. It was also stated that  Kaur  was
    not raised at the hearing at all but given my view on  the  irrelevance
    of paragraph 30 and Kaur, I did not need to consider this submission.






13. I was further asked to examine paragraphs 31, and 34C(a) of  the  Rules
    in relation to the notice of decision.  Paragraph  34C(a)  does  indeed
    make clear that notice of an invalid  application,  such  as  for  non-
    payment of a fee as occurred here, will be given in writing and  deemed
    to be received on the fate it is given. It is not in dispute here  that
    the notice of invalidity was never given contemporaneously  and  indeed
    was served many years later. Therefore,  as  there  was  no  notice  of
    invalidity given to the first Appellant  in  relation  to  her  invalid
    application, there cannot  have  been  any  abridgement  of  the  first
    Appellant's section 3C leave.  This  is  ironically  supported  by  the
    decision in Ved which the judge referred to. Notice  of  invalidity  is
    not an immigration decision but notice must be given nonetheless of the
    decision for it to have any effect. At any  rate,  the  judge  accepted
    that the documentation was sent  to  an  incorrect  address  (�58)  and
    consequently, it is clear that notice was not given and the application
    was not invalid until notice was sent which occurred  years  later  and
    after the invalidity in the application was inadvertently cured anyhow.








14. Mr Bazini submitted openly that the rules governing notice in paragraph
    34C(a) did not exist at the time but there was an unwritten informal
    policy which has now been transposed into the Rules alongside a policy
    which the Appellants meet also. To this extent, I was referred to the
    Long Residence guidance at page 20 which makes clear that one can
    overstay by 28 days after notice of invalidity has been given and
    notwithstanding that, any applicant who does not fall within that 28
    day period can show evidence of exceptional circumstances which
    prevented them applying earlier. It was submitted that it is implicit
    from the guidance that one's leave is not treated as broken otherwise
    the guidance would make no sense and there would be no point in having
    that guidance. I see the force in that common sense approach and
    purposive interpretation of the Rules and guidance alongside one
    another.






15. I find that the guidance and Rules support the conclusion that against
    these modern materials, the first Appellant would not have suffered any
    break in her leave, and given that there was no previous policy on this
    point but an unwritten informal practice, it would be unfair to not
    give the Appellant the benefit of that unwritten practice, particularly
    in light of the fact that the practice has now been documented and
    incorporated into the Rules and guidance.






16. Furthermore, this approach accords with the House of Lords' judgment in
    Anufrijeva, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for the Home
    Department & Anor [2003] UKHL 36 at [26] onwards wherein it is stated
    as follows:


         Notice of a decision is required before it can have the character
         of a determination with legal effect because the individual
         concerned must be in a position to challenge the decision in the
         courts if he or she wishes to do so. This is not a technical rule.
         It is simply an application of the right of access to justice. That
         is a fundamental and constitutional principle of our legal
         system: Raymond v Honey [1983] 1 AC 1, 10G per Lord Wilberforce; R
         v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Leech, [1994] QB
         198, 209D; R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p
         Simms [2000] 2 AC 115.






17. In relation to ��59-61 of the judge's decision concerning her
    understanding of the HSMP document of 4 December 2007 and the scheme,
    Mr Bazini relied upon the Home Office's HSMP Guidance for Applicants
    Version 2.0 valid from 07.11.06, which contains a footnote at Annex A
    see footnote which makes clear that the Appellant would not need the
    approval to succeed in her application for further leave but this was a
    formality to be completed before applying. At any rate, in my view,
    with respect, this point has no bearing or materiality upon the gap in
    question as notice was not given and so this issue is not relevant at
    all.






18. Therefore, I find in relation to the first gap that the judge
    materially erred in law given that the Respondent had failed to give
    notice of invalidity to the first Appellant and so the Appellant cannot
    be in default due to lack of notice and even so would have had 28 days
    permissible overstaying which would have cured any difficulty that may
    have arisen had notice been given. Given that the judge accepted that
    notice was not served, she was wrong to detour from that view for the
    reasons given above, and I find that the remaining documentary
    evidence, such as the letter from the Appellants' solicitors to
    PermitsUK of 28 February 2008 (page 398-399 of Appellant's Bundle 2 of
    2) makes clear that the application should be treated as in-time and
    establishes there was a 28-day policy which applied at the time which
    was never enforced either.






19. Consequently, the first alleged gap of 12 April 2007 to 26 March 2008
    falls away given that notice was never served and the application was
    made in time (on 26 February 2007, whereas leave expired a few days
    later) and either the appellants had section 3C leave or the guidance
    was not enforced and should have been (although the rules were not in
    force then, but exist now and demonstrate how such matters should be
    considered).





20. In relation to the second alleged gap, �62 onwards of the determination
    reveals that the applications were submitted on 27 March 2010 (the date
    that the Appellants' visas expired), but these applications were
    rejected on 8 April 2010; however the Appellants reapplied on 12 April
    2010, well within the 28 period of overstaying, but were refused with
    no right of appeal on 30 April 2010 on the basis that documents stated
    in the guidance (not the Rules) were not submitted. On 6 July 2010, a
    subsequent application was made and was granted on 27 July 2010.






21. The judge's decision at ��66-68 shows that she accepted the decision
    was unlawful and a nullity given the Supreme Court's decision in Alvi,
    R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2012] UKSC 33 concerning compliance with the guidance not laid before
    Parliament, as opposed to Immigration Rules which are.






22. At �70, the judge rejects evidence of self-employment, however these
    findings are irrelevant as the judge had already accepted that the
    refusal of 30 April 2010 was unlawful (see �68). Furthermore, I find
    that the judge's findings at �70 themselves breach the decision in Alvi
    because the items that were complained of as missing were listed in the
    guidance, not the Rules, and so the judge falls into the same error she
    noted in the decision of 30 April 2010 (see Appellant's bundle at pp.
    440, 460-461 of Bundle 2 and paragraphs 119 to 124).






23. Consequently, the re-application of 12 April 2010, within the 28-day
    period, was a lawful application and the decision refusing it on 30
    April 2010 was a nullity, and consequently, there was no decision upon
    that application until it was varied on 6 July 2010 which was anyhow
    granted on 27 July 2010. As a result, the second alleged gap of 1 May
    2010 to 26 July 2010 falls away.






24. Given my analysis and findings above as to the correct interpretation
    of the law, Rules and jurisprudence, the First-tier Tribunal committed
    errors of law such that the decision should be set aside in respect of
    those errors. In light of the above findings, the assessment of Article
    8 is also clearly unsafe as the factual basis of the Appellants'
    immigration history and the culpability for the delays perpetrated
    would have a bearing upon the weight given to the public interest in
    their removal (see Secretary of State for the Home Department v SS
    (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 at [56]).






    Remaking the Decision


  25. The standard of proof is to the civil standard and that of the balance
      of probability. I have considered all the evidence in the appeal,
      including the appellant's and respondent's bundles. I heard
      submissions from both parties which are set out in full in my record
      of proceedings.






26. Paragraph 276A of the Immigration Rules  as  at  22  November  2013  is
    stated in the following terms:


         Long residence in the United Kingdom


         276A. For the purposes of paragraphs 276B to 276D and 276ADE and
         399A.


         (a) "continuous residence" means residence in the United Kingdom
         for an unbroken period, and for these purposes a period shall not
         be considered to have been broken where an applicant is absent from
         the United Kingdom for a period of 6 months or less at any one
         time, provided that the applicant in question has existing limited
         leave to enter or remain upon their departure and return, but shall
         be considered to have been broken if the applicant:


             (i) has been removed under Schedule 2 of the 1971 Act, section
             10 of the 1999 Act, has been deported or has left the United
             Kingdom having been refused leave to enter or remain here; or


             (ii) has left the United Kingdom and, on doing so, evidenced a
             clear intention not to return; or


             (iii) left the United Kingdom in circumstances in which he
             could have had no reasonable expectation at the time of
             leaving that he would lawfully be able to return; or


             (iv) has been convicted of an offence and was sentenced to a
             period of imprisonment or was directed to be detained in an
             institution other than a prison (including, in particular, a
             hospital or an institution for young offenders), provided that
             the sentence in question was not a suspended sentence; or


             (v) has spent a total of more than 18 months absent from the
             United Kingdom during the period in question.


         (b) "lawful residence" means residence which is continuous
         residence pursuant to:


             (i) existing leave to enter or remain; or


             (ii) temporary admission within section 11 of the 1971 Act
             where leave to enter or remain is subsequently granted; or


             (iii) an exemption from immigration control, including where
             an exemption ceases to apply if it is immediately followed by
             a grant of leave to enter or remain.


         (c) 'lived continuously' and 'living continuously' mean 'continuous
         residence', except that paragraph 276A(a)(iv) shall not apply.





  27. In remaking the decision, I adopt the findings above of my own views
      upon the alleged gaps in continuous residence of (i) from 12 April
      2007 to 26 March 2008, and (ii) 1 May 2010 to 26 July 2010, noted by
      the Respondent as the sole points in issue under paragraph 276A.
      Consequently, in light of those findings and my detailed analysis, I
      find that there were no gaps in the Appellants' leave as alleged.






  28. The Respondent's Long Residence guidance also makes clear that 28-days
      overstaying does not break continuity of residence and small gaps are
      negligible and may be overlooked in the exercise of discretion.





29. Underlying these submissions is the reassurance that the Respondent's
    guidance also makes clear that when considering delays in submitting
    applications, any administrative errors by the Home Office can
    constitute exceptional circumstances (according to the 3rd bullet-point
    of the guidance). This can be said of the delay in both gaps in my
    view. The invalidity notice was served to an incorrect address by the
    Home Office and was not served until well after the event; and in the
    second instance, the decision was unlawful against the decision in Alvi
    and was not replaced until a grant of leave on 27 July 2010.
    Consequently, even if I am wrong in my findings concerning the
    Appellants submissions, in my view, the administrative errors made by
    the Home Office remove any culpability from the Appellants for the gaps
    in their residence which are exceptional circumstances in the guidance,
    and otherwise in my view, which would not and should not break their
    continuity of 10-years' leave.






  30. In conclusion, I find that the Appellants have resided for a 10-year
      continuous period in the UK and qualify for indefinite leave to remain
      pursuant to paragraph 276A of the Immigration Rules.






31. I therefore, do not propose to deal with Article 8 as the appeals  have
    succeeded on the above basis under paragraph 276A.






32. For the above reasons I set aside the judge's decision and  remake  the
    decision allowing the appeal under the immigration rules.






    Decision


33. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.





34. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.






35. I remake the appeals allowing them under the Immigration Rules.





    Anonymity


36. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity order and I  was  not
    asked to make one and do not see reason to do so at present.






    Fee Award


37. The First-tier Tribunal did not consider making  a  fee  award  as  the
    appeal was dismissed on  all  grounds.  In  light  of  this  Tribunal's
    decision, it is appropriate for a fee award  to  be  made  against  the
    Respondent for the Appellant's appeals in the sums paid by them.
