For the appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Juss  promulgated  8.12.14,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decisions  of  the  Secretary  of  State,
    dated 17.4.14, to refuse his application made on 10.1.14 for  leave  to
    remain in the UK on the basis of 10 years continuous  lawful  residence
    under paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules, and to remove  him  from
    the UK pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration Asylum and Nationality
    Act 2006.  The Judge heard the appeal on 16.10.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Shimmin  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    2.2.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 10.4.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Juss should be set aside.

 5. The grounds of application, which are poorly drafted, assert  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in:

      a) Finding that the claimant met the requirements  of  the  Rule  276B
         when there was a  gap  in  his  valid  leave  between  23.1.13  and
         10.1.14;

      b) Resolving conflicts of evidence without adequate evidence;

      c) Flawed analysis as to whether the claimant's 26.11.09  application,
         rejected for non-payment of fee and biometric data,  could  provide
         sufficient basis to meet Rule 276B.

 6. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Shimmin found it arguable  that
    the decision finding Rule 276B has been met  was  based  on  inadequate
    evidence and thus it is arguable that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    made material errors of law.

 7. The claimant first entered the UK in 2004  with  leave  as  a  student,
    later extended to 30.11.09. A few  days  before  expiry  of  leave,  on
    26.11.09 the claimant applied for further leave to  remain,  which  was
    rejected on 20.3.10 as invalid  for  want  of  fee  and  submission  of
    biometric data. The claimant challenges both issues.

 8. A further  application  was  then  submitted,  on  9.4.10,  refused  on
    18.5.10.  The  claimant  appealed  that  decision  to  the   First-tier
    Tribunal. In his decision promulgated 5.8.10, Judge Harris found in the
    claimant's favour on the payment issue, accepting that he  had  sent  a
    cheque in  payment  and  pointing  out  that  the  letter  stating  the
    application was invalid  wrongly  suggested  it  had  been  payment  by
    credit/debit account. However, Judge Harris found against the  claimant
    on the issue of biometric data, pointing out this was a requirement  of
    Rule 34A which had not been met.

 9. The claimant then issued Judicial Review proceedings on 21.10.10, which
    application was dismissed as being academic because  the  Secretary  of
    State had, without conceding the issues raised,  agreed  to  reconsider
    the decision of 18.5.10. That Judicial Review was made  in  respect  of
    not the application rejected for want of fee and biometric data, but of
    the subsequent application made in April 2010.  However,  the  decision
    was upheld on 27.5.11. �6 of Judge Juss' decision incorrectly sets  out
    the position in relation to the Judicial Review. However, it is  likely
    that Judge Juss was unaware of the precise chronology set out above and
    unaware that Judge Harris had already considered the issues  raised  in
    relation to validity of the 2009 application.

10. On 5.10.11 the claimant made a further application for leave to  remain
    as a Tier 4 student, which was granted on 2.5.12, until 24.1.13.

11. On 27.7.12 the appellant left the UK,  returning  on  4.9.12.  This  is
    irrelevant to the issues in the appeal and is  not  relied  on  by  the
    Secretary of State.

12. On 23.1.13 the appellant made a further application within extant leave
    for further leave to remain, which was refused on 12.6.13.  His  appeal
    against that  decision  was  dismissed  and  he  became  appeal  rights
    exhausted on 6.1.14.

13. The application for indefinite leave to remain on  the  grounds  of  10
    years continuous lawful residence, which is the subject matter of  this
    appeal, was made on 10.1.14.

14. According to the Secretary of State, it follows from the above that the
    claimant was in the UK without lawful leave at  least  between  18.5.10
    and 2.5.12, a period calculated by the Secretary of State as 1 year and
    11 months. However, the claimant's preceding leave actually expired  on
    30.11.09 and the exact period depends on whether 3C leave  applies  for
    the purpose of 276B. It is not necessary to resolve that issue.

15. In the  circumstances,  his  period  of  continuous  lawful  leave  was
    interrupted and he could not demonstrate  10  years  continuous  lawful
    leave at the time of his application for leave to remain on that  basis
    on 10.1.14.

16. The application was also refused by the Secretary of State because  the
    claimant claimed no family life in  the  UK  and  failed  to  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE in respect of private life, and  there
    were no exceptional or compelling  circumstances  to  justify  granting
    leave to remain outside the Rules.

17. At �12 of the decision, Judge Juss found that the claimant was able  to
    demonstrate 10 years continuous lawful residence, on the basis that his
    lawful residence was not "punctured" by a period without leave  between
    2010 and 2012, as the claimant had submitted payment  but  it  was  not
    processed by the Secretary of State and, the judge accepted, he had not
    been sent any information about the biometric tests.

18. At �6 the judge noted that following the refusal in  May  2010  of  his
    application made in April 2010, the claimant  made  a  Judicial  Review
    application on  21.10.10.  However,  before  the  Judicial  Review  was
    resolved the claimant made a further application in October 2011, which
    was granted in May 2012.

19. Judge Juss dismissed the article 8 aspect of the appeal,  finding  that
    the issue had already been dealt with in the previous decision of Judge
    Dove of November 2013.

20. The first ground of application asserts the claimant has not had  valid
    leave in the UK since the expiry of his leave on 24.1.13. Given that he
    did not enter the UK until 17.1.04, he could not have met  the  10-year
    continuous lawful residence requirement at  the  date  of  application,
    regardless as to whether there was a break in continuity.  However,  it
    is not necessary to resolve that issue as Mr Whitwell accepted that the
    10-year period could go to the date of hearing and was  not  restricted
    to the date of application, and the  claimant  did  not  become  appeal
    rights exhausted until 6.1.14 and the application was made a  few  days
    after that, on the assumption that section 3C leave counts as  part  of
    the continuous period of leave. 276B provides that periods of up to  28
    days overstaying or unlawful presence will not count.

21. Judge Harris having found for the claimant in relation to the  payment,
    Mr Whitwell felt he could not pursue that issue. Had Judge  Juss  known
    of that decision, undoubtedly Devaseelan would have been applied.

22. That leaves only the issue of the biometric data. Rule 34A(iv) provides
    that if the application form and/or related guidance notes require  the
    applicant to provide the  data,  it  must  be  provided.  However,  the
    claimant's case is that the sequence of events is that the Secretary of
    State sends out the request for biometric data only after acknowledging
    receipt of application and taking  payment.  The  request  is  for  the
    applicant  to  go  to  a  Post  Office  within  15  days   to   provide
    fingerprints. The claimant states that  request  was  never  sent  out,
    which would make sense if no payment were taken.  If  the  claimant  is
    right on this point then the biometric data issue is entirely dependent
    on the payment issue and as that has been resolved  in  favour  of  the
    claimant so should the biometric data.

23. Unfortunately, Mr Whitwell was  not  able  to  confirm  or  refute  the
    claimant's assertions through Mr Ahmed. The 2009 application  and  file
    were not amongst the papers he had. He thus applied for an  adjournment
    to investigate this issue.  This  was  opposed  by  the  claimant,  who
    complained that he had already had  several  hearings  on  this  issue.
    Following Basnet (validity of application  -  respondent)  [2012]  UKUT
    00113 (IAC), if the respondent asserts  that  an  application  was  not
    accompanied by a fee, and so was not  valid,  the  respondent  has  the
    burden of proof,  the  same  principle  must  apply  to  the  issue  of
    biometric data. It is for the Secretary of State to demonstrate that it
    was the failure of the claimant to provide the biometric data.

24. I find that it would not be in  the  public  interest  to  adjourn  the
    hearing for the procedure to be investigated  by  Mr  Whitwell  or  the
    Secretary of State. Enough time has already been taken on this  matter.
    The issue was clearly highlighted by the  claimant's  case  and  should
    have been addressed and resolved  before  today.  I  thus  refused  the
    application to adjourn.

25. On the failure of the Secretary of State to  discharge  the  burden  of
    demonstrating that there was a failure on the part of the  claimant  to
    submit the biometric data, when his case is that it was never sent  out
    and would not be sent out if payment not taken, and on the  basis  that
    the payment issue has previously been resolved in the claimant's favour
    and is no longer pursued by the Secretary of State, it follows that the
    2009 application was, after all valid. The consequence of that is  that
    the claimant does not have an interruption  in  the  necessary  10-year
    period of continuous lawful leave to remain in the UK.

26. It follows that the appeal by the Secretary of State must fail and that
    there is no material error of law in the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Conclusions:

27. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains allowed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee was payable and thus there can be no fee award.
