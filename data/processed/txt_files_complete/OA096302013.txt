Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Jack, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Chohan, of Counsel


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. For ease of reference I shall refer, throughout this determination,  to
    the Secretary of State as  the  "The  Respondent"  and  the  Respondent
    Zareena Begum as "the Appellant".

 2. The appeal is brought by the Respondent against a decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge Boyes) which in  a  determination  promulgated  on
    21st February 2014 allowed the  Appellant's  appeal  against  an  ECO's
    decision of 20th March 2013, refusing to grant her entry  clearance  to
    come to the United Kingdom with a view to settlement as the  spouse  of
    her Sponsor Mr Choudhary Muhammad Bashir "the Sponsor". The appeal  was
    allowed under Article 8 ECHR.

 3. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan  born  1st  January  1947.   Her
    application for entry clearance was refused because the  ECO  concluded
    firstly that she and the  Sponsor  were  not  related  as  claimed  and
    secondly she could not meet the financial requirements of  Appendix  FM
    of the Immigration Rules.

 4. After considering the evidence before him the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    found he was satisfied the Appellant and the  Sponsor  are  related  as
    claimed and theirs is  a  subsisting  marriage.  That  finding  is  not
    challenged and therefore stands.

 5. The Judge then went  on  to  consider  the  financial  requirements  of
    Appendix FM. In paragraphs 25 to 28 of his  determination  he  says  as
    follows.

         "The Financial Requirements

         A box is ticked on the visa application  form  to  state  that  the
         Sponsor is receiving a  disability  related  benefit.  However,  no
         evidence has been provided of this and it has not been referred  to
         elsewhere within the evidence. I am therefore not satisfied, on the
         balance of probabilities, that the Appellant  is  exempt  from  the
         financial requirements of Appendix FM.

         �142.70 per week can be seen going into the Sponsor's Barclays Bank
         account. This equates to  �7,420.40  per  annum.  The  Sponsor  and
         Appellant therefore do not  have  sufficient  income  to  meet  the
         financial requirements. In terms of savings the closing balance  on
         the Sponsor's Barclays Bank statement on  17th  December  2012  was
         �4,417.94 after a cash deposit of  �4,000  made  on  10th  December
         2012. No evidence or information has been provided as to the source
         of the �4,000. I also note that cash deposits of �1,000 and  �2,000
         were made on 6th August 2012. This left a balance on the account of
         �3,305.65. I do not have a full set of statements:  they  run  from
         2nd to 12th July and then jump to 30th July running through to  3rd
         September before jumping to 12th October 2012. The  balance  varies
         widely on the account for example on 21st November 2012  it  had  a
         much  smaller  balance  of  �139.26.  The  Appellant  has  produced
         evidence that she has a savings bond issued on 10th September  2008
         for the sum of 1,000,000 Pakistani rupees. The proof provided  from
         the bank is dated 26th  December  2012.  These  funds  are  roughly
         equivalent to �5,575. I accept that that (sic) Appellant has  these
         savings. However, I am not satisfied, on the  evidence  before  me,
         that the Sponsor has savings of around �4,000 as I do  not  have  a
         full set of bank statements  before  me  to  demonstrate  that  the
         �4,000 in the Sponsor's account were his own funds. This means that
         the savings available to the couple at the  date  of  decision  was
         �5,575 which was insufficient to meet the requirements of  Appendix
         FM.

         Whilst the Appellant (sic) has not provided evidence that he is  in
         receipt of housing benefit and council tax benefit  I  accept  that
         this is very likely in view of the fact that he is  in  receipt  of
         pension credit (guarantee  credit)  which  ordinarily  entitles  an
         individual to the maximum amount of both.

         The Appellant therefore does not meet the financial requirements of
         Appendix FM".

 6. Having concluded that the Appellant could not meet the requirements  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, the Judge  went  on  to  consider
    Article 8 ECHR claim.

 7. He noted that the Sponsor is in receipt of pension  income  of  �142.70
    per week. There was no reliable evidence that the sponsor  had  savings
    of �4000 as claimed. He did accept the appellant has savings of  around
    �5000. The Sponsor suffers from a serious medical condition  and  heart
    problems. The Appellant has problems with her hearing and her  eyesight
    but the Judge noted that the  sponsor  claimed  he  would  be  able  to
    maintain his wife if she came to UK. He told the Judge that  "all  they
    need is a piece of bread  each".  The  Judge  further  noted  that  the
    sponsor said in evidence that his wife would look after him. He allowed
    the appeal under Article 8 and in  his  findings/conclusions  said  the
    following:

         "Notwithstanding that, it would appear that  from  the  information
         before me, that he applied to stay under the regularisation  of  an
         overstayer's scheme which was put in place prior to the coming into
         effect of the Human Rights Act. He was granted indefinite leave  to
         remain and has had that now for around ten years. He has  had,  and
         continues to suffer from  serious  health  problems  which  require
         medical intervention and monitoring  on  a  regular  basis  and  is
         prescribed a wide range of medications. I do not  know  whether  or
         not he could access the same level  of  treatment  in  Pakistan,  I
         think it probably likely that he could, although I also consider it
         likely that there would probably be disruption to his treatment and
         monitoring initially if he were to move to Pakistan. If he  remains
         in the UK and his wife joins him here I think it  likely  that  she
         will, provide additional care and support for him  which  may  well
         lessen the nursing and social care that he otherwise may require as
         time goes on. In that respect the burden on  public  funds  may  be
         reduced. Considering the length of time that the Sponsor has  lived
         in the UK, the various medical conditions that he suffers from, the
         fact that the couple appeared to have funds to provide them with  a
         basic standard of living above the basic benefit threshold  for  an
         adult couple, and as that would  be  subject  to  further  scrutiny
         before the Appellant would be permitted to settle  prior  to  which
         she would not have access to welfare benefits in her own  right,  I
         consider that the Respondent's decision to  exclude  the  Appellant
         from the UK  is  unjustified  and  disproportionate.  The  decision
         therefore contravenes Article 8 of the ECHR".

 8. The Respondent sought and was granted permission to  appeal.  Thus  the
    matter comes before me to determine whether the First  -tier  Tribunals
    decision needs to be set aside for legal error and remade.

 9. Before me Mr Jack appeared on behalf of the Respondent  and  Mr  Chohan
    for the Appellant. Mr Jack relied upon the grounds seeking  permission.
    He said that the  Judge  had  materially  misdirected  himself  in  law
    because the Appellant's case  failed  under  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules. An Article 8 assessment should only be  carried  out
    therefore where there are compelling circumstances, not  recognised  by
    the Rules. This was not the case here.   No  exceptional  circumstances
    had been put forward to show that the Respondent's decision,  would  be
    unduly harsh within the meaning of the Article 8 jurisprudence.

10. He referred me to the case of Haleemudeen v Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  558  and  said  that  the  guidance
    contained in that  decision  strengthened  the  Respondent's  case.  In
    particular paragraph 64 of that decision said, when discussing  whether
    the Secretary of State's decision would be found to be a  proportionate
    interference  with  an  Appellant's  rights,  that  the  provisions  of
    Appendix FM undoubtedly constitute a formidable hurdle for an appellant
    to overcome.

11.  Mr Jack further submitted  that the Appellant's case is  very  similar
    to the facts found  in  Gulshan  (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -  correct
    approach) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 640  (IAC).That  case   deals  with  the
    concept of what  constitutes  exceptional  circumstances  and  explains
    that to embark on a freewheeling Article 8 analysis unencumbered by the
    Rules is not the correct approach.  He asked that I find  an  error  of
    law, set aside the decision and remake it, dismissing the appeal.

12. Mr Chohan submitted that on the facts  of  this  appeal   it  would  be
    exceptionally and unjustifiably  harsh  to  deny  the  Appellant  entry
    clearance. The sponsor and wife are apart as she  is  in  Pakistan.  He
    accepted that the Judge had found that  should  she  be  granted  entry
    clearance there would, in  all  probability,  be  further  recourse  to
    public funds. Nevertheless  this  would  be  offset  by  the  Appellant
    providing care for her husband, such as to  enable  him  to  leave  his
    hospital bed. He referred me to the medical  evidence  which  confirmed
    that following his coronary bypass, the Sponsor required  help  on  his
    discharge from hospital. The sponsor is not a well  man  and  his  wife
    would provide care for him.

13. I did enquire of Mr Chohan if he had any further medical evidence since
    the sponsor had apparently  left hospital following his cardiac surgery
    which had taken place  as far back as February 2013.  Mr Chohan said he
    accepted that the Sponsor had been released  from  hospital;  this  was
    evidenced by the fact that  he  had  attended  the  Appellant's  appeal
    hearing at Hatton Cross on 7th January 2014. He had nothing further  to
    add which could assist.

14. I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in his approach
    to Article 8. Gulshan identified that Article 8 assessments should only
    be carried out when there are compelling circumstances  not  recognised
    by the Rules. I accept that the Sponsor is ill there is  ample  medical
    evidence to support this. It is hard however to understand the  Judge's
    findings, or reasons  for  finding,  that  there  are  exceptional  and
    compelling  circumstances  within  the  meaning  of   the   Article   8
    jurisprudence. At paragraph 48 the Judge  sets  out  that  the  Sponsor
    suffers medical problems and then speculates.

         "He has had, and continues to suffer from serious  health  problems
         which require medical intervention  and  monitoring  on  a  regular
         basis and is prescribed a wide range of medications. I do not  know
         whether or not he could access  the  same  level  of  treatment  in
         Pakistan, I think it probably likely that he could, although I also
         consider it likely that there would probably be disruption  to  his
         treatment and monitoring initially if he were to move to  Pakistan.
         If he remains in the UK and his wife joins  him  here  I  think  it
         likely that she will, provide additional care and support  for  him
         which may well lessen the nursing and social care that he otherwise
         may require as time goes on. In that respect the burden  on  public
         funds may be reduced".

15. The Appellant and Sponsor have lived apart for many years in the  sense
    that the Sponsor has visited her only on occasions and  remitted  money
    to her. The Judge himself in his findings on that point said "The  fact
    that they have chosen to spend most of  their  married  life  apart  on
    different continents ,has been a lifestyle that they have chosen".  The
    appellant  comes well short of meeting the financial requirements under
    the Immigration Rules. For her to gain entry to the UK  would,  as  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge recognised, cost the UK  tax  payer  both  in
    terms of extra public funds for the couple and in terms of medical help
    which the Appellant as a 67 year old with hearing  and  sight  problems
    would require. The Judge's finding that this financial burden on public
    funds  may be offset by the provision of  support  to  the  sponsor  in
    terms of nursing and social  care  is  not  based  on  any  sustainable
    evidence. The Judge has speculated in reaching that finding.

16. The evidence before me shows that the sponsor and appellant have  lived
    separate lives for many years. The appellant remains in Pakistan in the
    Sponsor's house. She lives there with the couple's son  and  his  wife.
    The  Sponsor  visits,  telephones  the   appellant    and   sends   her
    remittances. The sponsor has managed to remain in the UK alone  without
    the appellant's support, despite his past  medical  history.  There  is
    nothing compelling or exceptional in the circumstances of  this  appeal
    such as to show that the respondent's decision to refuse the  appellant
    entry clearance is a disproportionate one under Article 8 ECHR.

DECISION

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside. I set aside the decision and
    I remake it as follows. This appeal is dismissed.
