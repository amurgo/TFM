Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss Vidhyadharan
For the Respondent:    Mr A Gilbert


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant (the Secretary of State for the Home Department)  appeals
    the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Finch.   In  a  determination
    promulgated on 28 January  2014  the  judge  allowed  the  respondent's
    appeal under Article 8 ECHR.

 2. The appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  that  decision  and  made
    various submissions that the appeal should only have been allowed under
    Article 8 ECHR where the circumstances are  exceptional  in  some  way.
    "Exceptional" means circumstances in which although the requirements of
    the Rules have not been met, refusal would result in  an  unjustifiably
    harsh outcome.

 3. The submissions are made that the judge failed to establish that  there
    are insurmountable obstacles to the respondent and his wife  continuing
    their family life in Turkey and also  that  "insurmountable  obstacles"
    constitute serious difficulties which the respondent  and  his  partner
    would face in continuing their family life outside the UK.  This  would
    entail something that could not be  overcome  even  with  a  degree  of
    hardship for one or more of  the  individuals  concerned.   It  is  not
    something that is merely  unreasonable  or  undesirable.  Although  the
    judge concluded that the respondent's wife would not work in Turkey due
    to her income being derived from being a sign language interpreter  the
    determination does not indicate that any evidence has been submitted in
    support of this finding. Furthermore it is said to be unclear  why  the
    judge concludes that  the  respondent's  partner  would  be  completely
    unable to seek any employment in Turkey on this basis and  that  whilst
    the respondent has two daughters in the UK he is not  their  sole  care
    giver. He can maintain  his  relationship  with  his  children  through
    visits and modern communicational means.  Whilst the judge  notes  that
    the respondent's partner offers support to  her  parents,  it  is  also
    noted that the parents receive relevant benefits and enjoy the  support
    of the NHS.  This does not present an insurmountable  obstacle  to  the
    respondent's partner relocating and she can continue  her  relationship
    with her parents through visits.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted stating that guidance upon the correct
    approach in such circumstances has now been provided in Shahzad (Art 8:
    legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC).  It was  found  arguable  that
    the  judge  had  failed  to   identify   adequately   what   compelling
    circumstances were not recognised by the Rules and  what  unjustifiably
    harsh results would flow  from  this  if  the  respondent  were  to  be
    removed.

My Decision

 5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge read the statements of and heard evidence
    from the respondent and his fianc�e.  The judge found them to be honest
    witnesses who did their best to assist the Tribunal.  The  judge  found
    also that the respondent was not entitled to leave to remain under  the
    Immigration Rules but then went on to consider  Article  8  ECHR.   The
    respondent has two British citizen daughters.  They live in the UK with
    their mother.  He provides them with financial support and  has  direct
    contact with them.  He is in the process of divorcing his wife  and  is
    engaged to a British citizen.  The judge found that family life  exists
    between the respondent and his daughters and also with his fianc�e.

 6. The judge reminded herself that the appellant  is  able  to  take  into
    account that the respondent is a foreign national  who  is  subject  to
    immigration control. He is not entitled to leave to remain in order  to
    protect his family and private life under the Immigration  Rules.   The
    judge took into account the fact that the UK  can  balance  the  public
    interest  in  maintaining  strict  immigration  controls  against   the
    respondent's individual rights.  The judge refers to the European Court
    of Human Rights  jurisprudence  indicating  that  it  is  necessary  to
    balance the public interest against the individual's rights in order to
    prevent public disorder and  protect  the  economic  wellbeing  of  the
    country.

 7. The  judge  also  took  into  account  the  Article  8  rights  of  the
    respondent's daughters and fianc�e as well as those of  the  respondent
    himself.  Thereafter the judge sets out the facts as found by her.  She
    concludes that  the  respondent  has  a  close,  genuine,  and  ongoing
    relationship with his two daughters and has offered them both emotional
    and financial support. This relationship would be diminished if he  was
    not permitted to remain in the United Kingdom.  The judge accepts  also
    that the respondent is engaged to be married and  his  fianc�e  is  now
    pregnant and the baby was due to be  born  shortly  after  the  hearing
    before me.  The respondent's fianc�e provides accommodation and earns a
    good salary and if the respondent is allowed to remain there is  a  job
    offer open for him, a fact that the judge  accepted  also.   The  judge
    gave reasons why the respondent's fianc�e would not be able  to  derive
    income from being a sign language interpreter in  Turkey  and  although
    the suggestion appears to be that this is an irrational finding, it was
    perfectly open to the judge to  conclude  as  she  did  on  the  point.
    Although the judge was silent as to whether  the  respondent's  fianc�e
    would be able to obtain employment in a different field, the  point  is
    made that she would be unable to work in her chosen field.   She  would
    also be in Turkey with a very young child and that would be  likely  to
    cause difficulties for earning a living, certainly  for  the  immediate
    future.

 8. The judge has not referred to any of the  burgeoning  number  of  cases
    that have arisen as a result of the changes to  the  Immigration  Rules
    and the relationship of those Rules to Article 8 ECHR.  For some reason
    the judge has also referred in paragraph 25 to applying  the  requisite
    "lower standard of proof" but this appears to  be  a  simple  error  as
    elsewhere at paragraph 7 she refers to the standard of proof being that
    of the balance of probabilities.

 9. As to the point about not referring explicitly to recent case  law  the
    jurisprudence makes clear that the Immigration Rules do not cover every
    conceivable situation where a foreign national may have a good claim to
    remain under Article  8  ECHR.  A  proportionality  exercise  is  still
    required.  The judge carried out such  a  proportionality  exercise  in
    this appeal and concluded, although not using the words, that  this  is
    one of those exceptional cases where it would  be  disproportionate  to
    require  that  the  respondent  be   removed   to   Turkey.   Referring
    specifically to particular cases would , it seems to me, have  elicited
    no different principles to those set out in the  determination  and  to
    which the judge directed herself.

10. The decision is  not  perverse  or  irrational  and  the  reasoning  is
    sufficient  to  justify  the  finding  of  disproportionately  on   the
    particular facts.

11. In those circumstances, and as I announced at the hearing, the decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal Judge is upheld.

12. An anonymity direction was made in the First-tier and  to  protect  the
    interests of the  children  involved  in  this  case  I  maintain  that
    direction.
