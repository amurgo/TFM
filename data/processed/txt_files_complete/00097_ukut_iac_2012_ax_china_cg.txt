      Officer










       Chinese family planning scheme:


    (1)    In China, all state obligations and benefits depend on the  area
    where a person holds their 'hukou',  the  name  given  to  the  Chinese
    household registration system. There are different provisions for those
    holding an 'urban hukou' or a  'rural  hukou':  in  particular,  partly
    because of the difficulties experienced  historically  by  peasants  in
    China, the family planning scheme is more  relaxed  for  those  with  a
    'rural hukou'.

    (2)    It is unhelpful (and a mistranslation of the  Chinese  term)  to
    describe the Chinese family planning scheme as  a  'one-child  policy',
    given the current vast range of exceptions  to  the  'one  couple,  one
    child'  principle.  Special  provision  is  made  for   'double-single'
    couples, where both are only  children  supporting  their  parents  and
    their grandparents. The number of children  authorised  for  a  married
    couple, ('authorised children') depends on the  provincial  regulations
    and the individual circumstances of the couple. Additional children are
    referred as 'unauthorised children'.

    (3)    The Chinese family planning scheme expects childbirth  to  occur
    within marriage.   It  encourages  'late'  marriage  and  'late'  first
    births.   'Late' marriages are defined as age 25 (male) and 23 (female)
    and 'late' first births from age 24.  A birth  permit  is  not  usually
    required for the first birth, but must be  obtained  before  trying  to
    become pregnant with any further children. The Chinese family  planning
    scheme also originally included  a  requirement  for  four-year  'birth
    spacing'. With  the  passage  of  time,  province  after  province  has
    abandoned that requirement. Incorrect  birth  spacing,  where  this  is
    still a requirement, results in a financial penalty.

    (4)    Breach of the Chinese family planning scheme is a civil  matter,
    not a criminal matter.

    Single-child families

    (5)    Parents who restrict themselves  to  one  child  qualify  for  a
    "Certificate of Honour for  Single-Child  Parents"  (SCP  certificate),
    which entitles them to a range of enhanced  benefits  throughout  their
    lives,  from  priority  schooling,  free  medical   treatment,   longer
    maternity, paternity and honeymoon leave, priority  access  to  housing
    and to retirement homes, and enhanced pension provision.

    Multiple-child families

    (6)    Any second child, even if authorised, entails the  loss  of  the
    family's SCP certificate. Loss of a family's SCP  results  in  loss  of
    privileged access to schools, housing, pensions and  free  medical  and
    contraceptive  treatment.  Education  and  medical   treatment   remain
    available but are no longer free.

    (7)    Where an unauthorised child is born, the family  will  encounter
    additional penalties. Workplace discipline for parents in employment is
    likely to include demotion or even loss of employment. In  addition,  a
    'social upbringing charge' is payable (SUC), which is based on  income,
    with a down payment of 50% and three years to pay the balance.

    (8)    There are hundreds of thousands of  unauthorised  children  born
    every year.  Family planning officials are not entitled  to  refuse  to
    register unauthorised children and there is no real risk of  a  refusal
    to register a child. Payment for birth permits, for the registration of
    children, and the imposition of SUC charges for unauthorised births are
    a significant source of revenue for local family planning  authorities.
    There is a tension between that profitability, and enforcement  of  the
    nationally imposed quota of births for the town, county  and  province,
    exceeding which can harm officials' careers.

    (9)    The financial consequences for a family of losing its  SCP  (for
    having more than one child) and/or of having SUC  imposed  (for  having
    unauthorised children)  and/or  suffering  disadvantages  in  terms  of
    access to education, medical treatment, loss of  employment,  detriment
    to future employment etc will  not,  in  general,  reach  the  severity
    threshold to amount to persecution or  serious  harm  or  treatment  in
    breach of Article 3.

    (10) There are regular national campaigns to bring down the birth rates
    in provinces and local areas which have exceeded the  permitted  quota.
    Over-quota birth rates threaten the employment and  future  careers  of
    birth control officials in those regions, and where there is a national
    campaign, can result  in  large  scale  unlawful  crackdowns  by  local
    officials in a small number of provinces  and  areas.  In  such  areas,
    during such large scale crackdowns, human  rights  abuses  can  and  do
    occur, resulting in women, and sometimes men, being forcibly sterilised
    and pregnant women having their pregnancies  forcibly  terminated.  The
    last such crackdown took place in spring 2010.

    Risk factors

    (11)   In general, for female returnees,  there  is  no  real  risk  of
    forcible sterilisation or forcible termination in China. However, if  a
    female returnee who has already had her permitted quota of children  is
    being returned at a time when there is  a  crackdown  in  her   'hukou'
    area, accompanied by unlawful practices  such  as  forced  abortion  or
    sterilisation, such a returnee would  be  at  real   risk  of  forcible
    sterilisation  or,  if  she  is  pregnant  at  the  time,  of  forcible
    termination of an unauthorised pregnancy.  Outside of these times, such
    a female returnee  may  also  be  able  to  show  an  individual  risk,
    notwithstanding the absence of a general risk, where there is  credible
    evidence that she, or members of her family remaining  in  China,  have
    been threatened with, or have suffered, serious  adverse  ill-treatment
    by reason of her breach of the family planning scheme.

    (12)    Where  a  female  returnee  is  at  real   risk   of   forcible
    sterilisation or termination of pregnancy in  her  'hukou'  area,  such
    risk is of persecution, serious harm and Article 3  ill-treatment.  The
    respondent accepted that such risk would be  by  reason  of  a  Refugee
    Convention reason,  membership of a particular social group, 'women who
    gave birth in breach of China's family planning scheme'.

    (13)   Male returnees do not, in general, face a real risk of  forcible
    sterilisation, whether in their 'hukou' area or  elsewhere,  given  the
    very low rate of sterilisation of males overall,  and  the  even  lower
    rate of forcible sterilisation.

    Internal relocation

    (14) Where a real risk exists in the 'hukou' area, it may  be  possible
    to avoid the risk by moving to a city.  Millions  of  Chinese  internal
    migrants, male and female, live and work in cities where  they  do  not
    hold an 'urban hukou'.  Internal migrant women are required to stay in
    touch with  their  'hukou'  area  and  either  return  for  tri-monthly
    pregnancy tests or else send back test results.  The  country  evidence
    does not indicate a real risk of effective pursuit of internal  migrant
    women leading to forcible family  planning  actions,  sterilisation  or
    termination,     taking      place      in      their      city      of
    migration. Therefore, internal relocation will, in almost all  cases,
    avert the risk in the hukou area.  However, internal relocation may not
    be safe where there is credible evidence of individual pursuit  of  the
    returnee or her family, outside the 'hukou' area. Whether it is  unduly
    harsh to expect an individual returnee and her family  to  relocate  in
    this way will be a question of fact in each case.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the  Asylum
   and Immigration Tribunal (AIT) in January 2006 following a hearing before
   Judge Fitzgibbon  who  dismissed  her  appeal  against  the  respondent's
   decision in October 2005, to refuse to  grant  her  leave  to  enter  the
   United Kingdom.  In February  2007,  Senior  Immigration  Judge  Southern
   decided that the AIT had materially  erred  in  law  and  set  aside  the
   Immigration Judge's decision.  We  understand  that  the  respondent  has
   received further representations from the appellant's husband which  will
   be determined in line with her appeal, but may give rise  to  a  separate
   right of appeal for him, but that  is  a  matter  of  which  the  present
   Tribunal is not seised.

Introduction

2. The disputed part of the appellant's account concerned her claim to  have
   a former partner, a husband by customary marriage, in her  home  province
   of Hunan in China, and to have left two  children  by  that  relationship
   with her parents-in-law, when she fled to the  United  Kingdom  in  2002.
   Her former partner was also said to be ethnically Han.  We do not  accept
   that part of her  account  as  credible,  for  the  reasons  set  out  at
   paragraphs 197-199 of this determination.

3. The appellant and her husband are Chinese citizens, of the  majority  Han
   ethnicity. They met in the United Kingdom in 2004.   They  now  have  two
   children, a daughter born in 2005 and a son in  2007,  both  born  before
   they married in  March  2009.   Both  are  only  children  and  they  are
   therefore a  'double-single'  couple  (see  paragraph  16  below).  Those
   elements of the appellant's account are fully supported by United Kingdom
   birth certificates and a marriage certificate.  We  have  approached  the
   question of risk on return now on the  basis  that  the  appellant  is  a
   married woman with two United Kingdom-born children, and that the  family
   would be returned to China together.

   interest may be found in the following paragraphs:

Procedural history

5. The oral evidence in this appeal was heard  on  8-9  December  2009.   We
   received oral evidence from the appellant and her  husband,  and  country
   evidence from Dr Jackie Sheehan, and by video  link,  from  Professor  Fu
   Hualing in Hong Kong.  Sitting as the AIT, we considered and reached  our
   credibility conclusions  on  the  disputed  element  of  the  appellant's
   account (that is, the account of her history in China) immediately  after
   the oral evidence in December 2009.   The  AIT  ceased  to  exist  on  15
   February 2010 and this appeal continued as an  appeal  before  the  Upper
   Tribunal (IAC).  A transfer order has been made, the effect of  which  is
   that this appeal falls to be re-made by this panel of the Upper Tribunal.



6. Both parties sought permission to add  to  the  country  evidence  during
   2010.   In November 2010, the appellant's solicitors sent  a  letter  and
   some further evidence. We gave the respondent  permission  to  submit  an
   updated report from Professor Fu, which was finally received at the Upper
   Tribunal on 30 June 2011.   Having considered Professor Fu's  report,  we
   re-listed  the  matter  and  received  further  updated   materials   and
   submissions in December 2011.  We proceed to re-make  this  determination
   in the light of  all  of  the  extensive  country  materials  before  us,
   including the latest versions of the UKBA Country of Origin Report  (COI)
   and US State Department Report, which are in the public domain.

The asylum claim

7. The appellant's original asylum claim was based on her  claimed  marriage
   and two children in China, and on her pregnancy with what would have been
   a third child, conceived outside marriage  in  the  United  Kingdom  (the
   daughter born in November 2005).  The asylum application did not name her
   baby's father.

8. The appellant claimed to be at risk on return because she owed  money  to
   the snakehead agent who had arranged her travel to  the  United  Kingdom.
   She stated that she had travelled on a Chinese  passport,  which  she  no
   longer had, which the agent had obtained for her.

9. Before the Immigration Judge,  she  claimed  to  have  received  specific
   threats of harm or kidnap to her children  in  China.   She  also  feared
   return to China as a single parent, a factor which  has  ceased  to  have
   relevance as she is now a married woman. Finally, the  appellant  claimed
   to be at risk as a member of a particular social group: 'women  who  have
   breached the Chinese family planning policy'.

Country guidance issues

10.  The  appeal  was  identified  for  possible  country  guidance  on  the
   operation of the Chinese family planning scheme, in particular  the  risk
   of persecution or serious harm  on  return  to  China  affecting  Chinese
   citizens living abroad and their children ('overseas Chinese').

11. There is no country guidance bearing directly on  the  question  of  the
   Chinese family planning scheme or  the  position  of  returning  overseas
   Chinese,  whose  children  have  been  born  abroad  (within  or  outside
   marriage).  In TC (One child policy -  prison  conditions)  China  [2004]
   UKIAT 00138, the Immigration Appeal  Tribunal  (IAT),  dealing  with  the
   October 2003 Country of Origin Report on China, upheld  an  Adjudicator's
   determination that a man who had been ordered to pay a fine of RMB  30000
   (�3000) for having four children, and left China  because  he  could  not
   pay, would on return simply be made to pay his fine.   The  IAT  decision
   in TC is of little assistance, because it is very much out  of  date,  it
   concerns a different fact set from that which we are considering  and  it
   is no longer a country guidance case.

12. The questions of trafficking and illegal exit,  originally  intended  as
   part of the guidance in this appeal, depended on a linked case which  did
   not proceed before us. They were considered in 2009 by panels of the AIT,
   in HC & RC (Trafficked women) China CG [2009] UKAIT 00027 and ZC & Others
   (Risk, illegal exit, loan sharks)  China  CG  [2009]  UKAIT  00028.   The
   materials before the AIT in those appeals are set out at the end of  each
   decision, and are up-to-date as  at  the  end  of  2008.   We  shall  not
   therefore give guidance on those issues in this decision.

13. In November 2008 at a directions hearing, the parties agreed a  list  of
   matters with which the country experts should be asked to assist us.   It
   was accepted before us, on the Respondent's behalf, that, if there was  a
   real risk of persecution, there  was  an  applicable  Refugee  Convention
   reason.  The remaining issues in this appeal were as follows:

      (a)   Penalties for breaching the Chinese family planning  scheme  and
      policies;

      (b)   Risk factors in particular provinces

      (c)   Internal relocation;

      (d)   Article 8 ECHR aspects of return to China  and/or  removal  from
           the United Kingdom.

14. The respondent accepted that  the  appellant  and  women  like  her  are
   members of a particular social group, "women who gave birth in breach  of
   China's family planning scheme".  Other issues (such as  the  Appellant's
   claimed fear of the snakehead agent) in the original  claim,  or  in  the
   claim as advanced before the Immigration Judge, were not advanced  before
   us.

15. We have taken into account all of the experts'  evidence,  both  in  the
   form of reports and  oral  evidence,  including  the  exhibits  to  their
   reports, and the other documents and international materials before us.

Concepts in Chinese family planning

16. We have adopted a consistent  description  for  the  principal  concepts
   involved in China's family planning scheme, as follows:

     a) 'Authorised' and 'unauthorised' births and children. Children  born
        outside the family planning scheme are described variously  in  the
        materials we have seen as 'out of  plan'  children,  hei  haizi  or
        'black children', and 'unauthorised children'.  We refer to them in
        this decision  as  'unauthorised  children'  and  their  births  as
        'unauthorised births'.  We refer to the children  born  within  the
        family planning scheme as 'authorised children' and their births as
        'authorised births';

     b) Certificate of Honour for Single-Child Parents' (SCP  Certificate).
        Parents with only one child qualify  for  this  certificate,  which
        entitles them to a range  of  enhanced  benefits  throughout  their
        lives, from priority  schooling,  free  medical  treatment,  longer
        maternity,  paternity  and  honeymoon  leave,  priority  access  to
        housing and to retirement homes, and enhanced pension provision;

     c) Currency.  References to the Chinese currency vary,  describing  it
        as the Yuan (�), the  Renminbi  (RMB),  or  Chinese  Yuan  Renminbi
        (CNY).   We  have  adopted  Renminbi  and   used   throughout   the
        abbreviation RMB.  As at March 2012, the conversion rate is RMB 10:
        �1;

     d) 'Double-single'  couples.   The  Chinese  authorities  recognise  a
        social problem for those couples  where  both  are  only  children,
        supporting  their  parents  and  grandparents.   It  is   sometimes
        described as the '4-2-1' problem (four grandparents,  two  parents,
        one child supporting all of them) or as  the  problem  of  'double-
        single'  couples,  which  is  the  description  we  use   in   this
        determination;

     e) Family Planning Scheme. Given the vast range of exceptions  to  the
        'one couple, one child' principle with which  the  pre-2004  scheme
        was identified,   we do not consider it appropriate to describe the
        post-2005 statutory scheme as a 'one-child policy'.  (We understand
        that 'one-child policy' is not a translation of the  term  used  by
        the Chinese government to describe the statutory scheme);

     f)  'Foreign-born  children'.   Children  born  to  Chinese  nationals
        outside mainland China, whether in Hong Kong, Macao, or the rest of
        the world;

     g) Hukou.  A system of family registration, used to  control  internal
        migration in China between urban and rural  areas.   In  1958,  the
        Communist  government  allocated  'rural'  or  'urban'  hukous   to
        individuals.  Today,  the  'urban  hukou  '  or  'rural  hukou'  is
        inherited and passed from parent to child.  All social benefits and
        obligations derive from hukou, including  entitlement  to  a  birth
        permit, social security, contraception and medical care, education,
        housing, land and pension provision. Although it remains  difficult
        to change hukou, the system has failed  to  prevent  mass  internal
        migration to the large cities in modern  times,  with  hundreds  of
        thousands of people living away from  their  hukou.   Nevertheless,
        women of fertile age are obliged to  send  back  regular  pregnancy
        tests to their hukou area, seek birth  permits  there,  and  comply
        with local family planning regulation;

     h) 'Income Multiplier'.  Social Upbringing Charge (SUC) is  calculated
        as a multiple of an income reference rate based on the average  per
        capita annual disposable income for urban  residents,  or  net  per
        capita income for rural residents ('the Income Multiplier').  Where
        the couple's actual income is known, that will be  used  if  it  is
        higher than the average.  In appeals from  abroad,  however,  there
        will be no local income information and the  applicable  rate  will
        always be the per capita average;

     i) 'Internal migrant'.  A person living away from  their  hukou  area,
        typically in a large city elsewhere in China;

     j) National Population and Family Planning  Commission  (NPFPC).   The
        Chinese state agency responsible  to  the  State  Council  for  all
        aspects of population and family planning, including collection and
        reporting of relevant statistical information.  The  NPFPC  English
        website is available at www.npfpc.gov.cn/en/about/index.aspx.;

     k) 'Overseas Chinese'.  Chinese nationals returning from abroad,  with
        or  without  foreign-born  children,  including  those   who   have
        travelled to Hong Kong or Macao to have their children;

     l)  'Social  upbringing  charge'  (SUC).  Similarly,  there  are  many
        translations for the sums payable to the family planning  authority
        in  respect  of  unauthorised  births:   the  phrase  used  in  the
        overarching national Regulations translates as  'social  upbringing
        charge'.  For clarity we have used the abbreviation SUC  throughout
        this decision, in preference to 'fine', or any of the  other  terms
        used in the international materials;

     m) 'Temporary residence  permit'  (TRP).   An  administrative  measure
        enabling internal migrants to move to and live in cities.  It  does
        not require them to abandon their rural  hukou  and  the  land  and
        social rights which that confers on them and  their  families,  who
        may still be residing in their hukou area.   In practice it is used
        by cities to control internal migrants and to discourage them  from
        permanent residence in the city.

   shall refer to the appropriate parts thereof in this determination.



History of the Chinese family planning scheme

21. It is helpful to put the current Chinese family planning scheme  in  its
   historical context.  Under Chairman Mao, Chinese families were encouraged
   to have as many children as  possible,  which  led  to  an  unprecedented
   population explosion. The population of China had doubled in less than 30
   years, from just over half a billion in 1950 to a billion in 1978.

22. A family planning scheme, limiting most families to just one child,  was
   introduced in 1978 by the Chinese government as part of an  economic  and
   social overhaul after the death of Chairman Mao  in  1976.   Uncontrolled
   population growth was  recognised  to  be  unsustainable  and  population
   control was perceived as necessary to  alleviate  the  resulting  social,
   economic, and environmental problems.  The Chinese  population  currently
   stands at 1.35 billion and the family planning scheme  is  said  to  have
   prevented a further 400 million births since 1978.

23. In 2001/2, the Chinese government introduced  an  over-arching  national
   legislative  and  regulatory  structure  to  replace  the   corrupt   and
   unreliable local regulation of family  planning  across  China,  the  new
   scheme being based on payment  rather  than  punishment.   The  structure
   consisted of the PFPL, brought into force on 1 September  2002,  and  the
   SUC Regulations which, along  with  specific  PFP  Regulations  for  each
   province, came into force on 1 January 2003.

24. In simple terms, the new regime gave  a  wide  range  of  financial  and
   social advantages to persons who restricted themselves voluntarily to one
   child and who were awarded an  SCP  Certificate.  Further  children  were
   permitted, in a variety  of  circumstances,  with  considerable  regional
   discretion and differences in implementation, but in each case, the birth
   of the second child entailed the loss of  the  SCP  Certificate  and  the
   benefits it entailed.

25.  Enforcement  was  lax  initially.    The   Chinese   authorities   were
   considering whether to continue the policy, and during the  period  2001-
   2004, there was very little national enforcement.  Many provinces'  birth
   rates rose over their allocation.

26. After a period of review, and with  claimed  support  from  70%  of  the
   population, the Chinese family planning scheme was reaffirmed  in  2004/5
   and enforcement recommenced.  We have considered  the  risk  to  overseas
   Chinese and their additional children on the  basis  of  how  the  family
   planning scheme is currently enforced and carried into effect.

27. The family planning scheme has been in  place,  in  various  forms,  for
   over 30 years.  The evidence indicates that there is considerable  social
   support for it, but it has disadvantages, among which are  an  excess  of
   male over female children, leading to difficulties in finding  wives  for
   single Chinese men, and the significant burden for children  in  'double-
   single'  couples  responsible  for  supporting  two  parents   and   four
   grandparents.

Statutory and regulatory framework

28.  The  national  legal  framework  which  underpins  the  Chinese  family
   planning scheme is the PFPL, which came into force in September 2002.

29. The family planning scheme is based on 'late' marriage and  certificates
   of permission, which must be obtained during  pregnancy  (for  the  first
   birth) and in advance (for further births). 'Late' marriages are  defined
   as from age 25 (male) and 23 (female) and 'late' first  births  from  age
   24.  It follows, therefore, that  if  a  woman  marries  at  23,  she  is
   entitled to seek to become pregnant almost  immediately  with  her  first
   child.

30. Some of the terms used in the family planning scheme law  appear  to  be
   terms of art.  'Technical services' is  used  in  these  translations  to
   denote maternity and fertility care, up to  and  including  birth  and/or
   medical termination or sterilisation, where required.  'Unit' means  work
   unit or place of employment.

31. The provisions on regulation of fertility are to be  found  at  Articles
   17-22 in Chapter III of the PFPL:

      "Article 17.     Citizens have the right to reproduction  as  well  as
      the responsibility for practicing family planning  according  to  law.
      Husbands and wives bear equal responsibility for family planning.

      Article 18. The State shall  maintain  its  current  fertility  policy
      encouraging late marriage and childbearing and  advocating  one  child
      per couple; arrangements for  a  second  child,  if  requested,  being
      subject to law and Regulation.  Specific measures shall be enacted  by
      the People's Congress or its  standing  committee  in  each  Province,
      autonomous region, and  municipality.  Ethnic  minorities  shall  also
      practice family planning. Specific measures shall be  enacted  by  the
      People's  Congress  or  its  standing  committee  in  each   Province,
      autonomous region, and municipality.

      Article 19. In implementing  family  planning,  the  primary  emphasis
      shall be on contraception. The State shall create conditions conducive
      to individuals being assured of an informed choice of safe, effective,
      and appropriate contraceptive methods. Safety of recipients  of  birth
      control procedures must be ensured.

      Article 20.      Couples of reproductive age shall be conscientious in
      adopting contraceptive methods and in accepting the guidance of family
      planning technical services.  Incidences of unwanted pregnancies shall
      be prevented and reduced.

      Article 21.   Couples of reproductive age who practice family planning
      shall be able to obtain technical services free of  charge  under  the
      basic items as specified by the State.
      The cost of the  aforesaid  services  shall  be  itemized  and  public
      appropriations made in accordance with applicable State Regulations or
      be guaranteed by social insurance plans.

      Article 22. Discrimination against and mistreatment of women who  give
      birth  to  female  children  or  who  suffer  from   infertility   are
      prohibited. Discrimination against, mistreatment, and  abandonment  of
      female infants are prohibited."

32. Chapter IV sets out a  scheme  of  incentives  and  social  security  to
   support the programme: couples who hold the SCP  Certificate  are  to  be
   recognised and rewarded by the state (Article 23),  a  package  of  basic
   social security measures is to be established, with  separate  provisions
   in  rural  areas  (Article  24),  citizens  who  marry  late  and   delay
   childbearing are entitled to longer nuptial and maternity leave and other
   welfare benefits  (Article  25),  including  leave  for  family  planning
   surgery,  and  subsidies  and  employment  protection  during  pregnancy,
   delivery and breast feeding (Article 26); they are entitled to state  and
   local incentives, preferential access to funding, technology and training
   from their local authority and priority  for  poverty-alleviation  loans,
   work relief and other social assistance when the household is in poverty.



33. Chapter VI deals with  legal  liability.  Articles  36-40  set  out  the
   penalties for corruption and  breaches  of  the  policy  by  doctors  and
   abortionists, family planning  administrative  departments  (forgery  and
   sale of certificates  relating  to  family  planning),   family  planning
   service providers (malpractice and delay in emergency response, diagnosis
   or treatment), staff of state organs (various types  of  corruption)  and
   other local government officials (violations to be rebuked  in  a  public
   circular and administrative penalties on the agency  and  the  individual
   directly responsible).

34. Articles 41 and 43 set  out  the  penalties  which  affect  individuals;
   Article 44 gives a remedy for infringement on their legitimate rights and
   interests by an administrative organ:

      "Article 41. Citizens who  give  birth  not  in  accordance  with  the
      stipulations in  Article  18  shall  pay  a  social  compensation  fee
      prescribed by this law. Those failing to pay the  full  amount  before
      the due date shall be levied  a  late  payment  penalty  specified  in
      applicable State Regulations. Those who persist in  non-payment  shall
      be  sued  for  payment  in  People's  Court  by  the  family  planning
      administrative departments that levied the social compensation fee.

      Article 42. The state employees levied  the  social  compensation  fee
      described in Article 41 shall be subject to additional  administrative
      penalties, according to law. Others levied such a fee shall be subject
      to additional disciplinary measures imposed by their employing units.

      Article 43. Those who resist or hinder family planning  administrative
      departments and staff in the performance of  their  legitimate  duties
      shall be subject to criticism and ordered to amend  their  conduct  by
      the  family  planning  administrative  departments  involved.  Conduct
      breaching public security  Regulations  shall  be  subject  to  public
      security penalties. Acts constituting a crime shall  be  referred  for
      criminal prosecution.

      Article 44. Citizens, entities  treated  as  legal  persons  or  other
      organizations deeming that an administrative organ  has  infringed  on
      their  legitimate  rights  and  interests  while  implementing  family
      planning policy may appeal for review or sue for redress."


35. Article 42 imposes additional penalties on state  employees  who  breach
   the PFPL, over and above those  imposed  on  individuals  by  their  work
   units.

36. The administration scheme for the SUC is set out in State Council  Order
   no 357.  Articles 1 and 2 set the context, and the rights and  duties  of
   both citizens and officials in relation to childbearing.

37. Article 3 sets out the  method  of  calculating  the  Income  Multiplier
   which is used when setting the SUC for an unauthorised birth.  SUC is  to
   be imposed taking into account the actual income of the parties  and  the
   detailed circumstances of the breach. No unit or individual  may  without
   authority establish additional charges or increase the Income  Multiplier
   used.  All SUC decisions are to be in writing (Article 4) and there is  a
   right of appeal (Article 9)  with  suspensive  effect.    Decisions  take
   effect when delivered to the parties, and SUC is to  be  paid  within  30
   days of receiving the  decision.   The  rest  of  the  Council  Order  is
   concerned with corruption offences.

38.  Each Province, working  from  those  principles,  has  its  own  family
   planning scheme Regulations governing the imposition and  enforcement  of
   SUC in that province.  The  SCP  Certificate  gives  access  to  enhanced
   medical, pension, housing and employment benefits  which  are  withdrawn,
   and additional SUC penalties  imposed,  where  an  individual  or  family
   breaches the  policy.   Employers  are  also  expected  to  penalise  the
   employee by penalties ranging between demotion and dismissal.  Breach  of
   the policy disentitles the individual and those in his or her  work  unit
   to government contracts, government employment, or local  recognition  of
   various types, in some cases on a  discretionary  basis,  in  some  cases
   permanently, and in some cases for a fixed period of years.  We deal with
   the local PFP Regulations, and  actual  practice  in  various  provinces,
   separately  below.  That  is  the  national  and  provincial  legal   and
   regulatory family planning framework within which we consider the risk on
   return.

Provincial Regulations

39. Since this decision is intended to give country guidance on  the  family
   planning scheme  as  a  whole,  we  summarise  relevant  aspects  of  the
   provincial PFP Regulations in Hunan, Yunnan, Fujian,  Guangdong,  Beijing
   and Shanghai. As set out at paragraph 19 (4) above,  it  is  possible  to
   access the PFP Regulations for other provinces on the UNESCAP website  if
   required.

Hunan Province

40. The Regulations for Hunan Province set out the source of  the  power  to
   regulate and the  various  overarching  responsibilities,  including  the
   responsibility of local People's  Governments  to  fund  family  planning
   Regulation work (remembering that the fines go straight to  the  national
   State Treasury).  The fertility Regulation provisions begin at Regulation
   14.

41.  Regulation  15  states  that  Hunan  Province  will  give  second-child
   permission to couples in  the  following  circumstances:   those  with  a
   disabled first child; childless couples who have adopted a  first  child;
   where one spouse has a  child  before  the  marriage  and  the  other  is
   childless; 'double-single' couples who have only one child; or where both
   spouses are returned overseas Chinese, or residents of Hong  Kong,  Macau
   or Taiwan who have settled in mainland China  and  only  have  one  child
   settled there.

42.  Additionally,  where  both  husband  and  wife  have  a  rural   hukou,
   Regulation 16 permits a second child where:   the only child  is  female;
   one (not necessarily both) of the spouses is the child of an  only  child
   (analogous to the 'double-single' problem,  but  where  only  one  spouse
   bears that burden); one spouse is the only child of a  martyr;  the  only
   child is a son and one spouse is a soldier  with  a  Grade  2  or  higher
   disability;  brothers or sisters are all rural residents of whom only one
   is able to bear children and the other siblings have not adopted a child;
   or where the parties each have one disabled child before remarriage,  and
   neither child will grow to have a normal  capacity  to  work.   There  is
   provision for yet further Regulations in relation to the situation  where
   the only child is female, but we have not seen such Regulations.

43. Regulation 17 disapplies Regulation 16 where one  spouse  has  an  urban
   hukou and one has a rural hukou, and either or both of them have  changed
   from urban to rural hukou.   If rural residents change to an urban hukou,
   the more relaxed rural r�gime is to apply for  three  years.    There  is
   provision for couples one or both of whom are from an ethnic minority  to
   apply for a second child.   A first pregnancy may be registered after  it
   has occurred, but permission must be  sought  in  advance  for  a  second
   pregnancy. The effect of this complex scheme is that it seems  relatively
   easy to qualify for a second child, except, of course,  that  the  couple
   will always lose the SCP Certificate  when  the  second  child  is  born.
   Where a first pregnancy results in twins or a multiple birth, that couple
   will not be awarded an SCP Certificate, although the children will not be
   treated as unauthorised.

44. Regulation 22 regulates  contraception:   it  states  that  intrauterine
   devices  (IUDs)  should  be  used  as  the  main   long-term   means   of
   contraception for women who have already borne  two  children.   However,
   where a couple has two children, tubal ligation is the recommended method
   of contraception. Regulation 23 provides for reversal of sterilisation in
   special circumstances such as the death of the child, and for  artificial
   insemination where couples are infertile or unable to give birth.

45. SCP Certificate holder benefits are set out, including:   12  additional
   days of honeymoon leave; thirty days of extra maternity leave (subject to
   the children being born 'late');  15 days of carers' leave for the father
   at the time of the birth;  child's health payments of RMB 5-20 (�0.50-�2)
   monthly until the child reaches the age  of  14,  paid  by  the  couple's
   employer  or  employers,  or  if  unemployed,  the  local  authority;  an
   additional one person share  of  collective  economic  benefits  or  land
   compensation  charges;  preference  in  allocation  of  kindergarten  and
   nursery places,  access  to  education,  medical  treatment,  employment,
   vocational  training  and  so  on;  and  other  awards  and  preferential
   treatment locally.  SCP Certificate holders are entitled (Regulation  29)
   to free contraception and  related  medical  examination  and  provision,
   including abortion and sterilisation of male or female by tubal ligation.
    Time in hospital for such purposes is to be treated  as  time  at  work.
   Regulation 30 provides for the development of a small loans facility  for
   rural families implementing family planning.

46. In  addition,  any  couple  or  person  entitled  to  two  children  who
   voluntarily do not take up that option will receive a  financial  reward,
   in rural areas a sum equating at least to the average net income for  the
   previous year, or  in  urban  areas,  an  amount  equal  to  the  average
   disposable  income  for  the  previous  year  (Regulation   26).    Under
   Regulation 27, urban parents of  one  child  and  rural  parents  of  two
   (conceived lawfully) have preferential treatment in old age insurance and
   care establishments, as well as financial aid where the  only  child  has
   died or is disabled, or the family is in difficulty and impoverished.

47. For those who do  not  comply  with  family  planning,  SCP  Certificate
   benefits are withdrawn.  If pregnancies then result, they are required to
   pay for their own terminations or sterilisations.   Unlawful  pregnancies
   must be terminated promptly and, if this  is  not  done,  local  People's
   Governments  may  require  a  deposit  of  RMB  2000-10000  (�200-�1000),
   refundable when the termination has occurred.   Sex  choice  terminations
   are prohibited.

48. Chapter 6, Regulations 42-44 sets  out  additional  penalties  for  non-
   compliance.  Having regard to the Income Multiplier, and with  regard  to
   the severity of the breach and the actual income of the parties, the  SUC
   for an uncertificated but otherwise lawful second birth  is  30%  of  the
   couple's total income in the  previous  year;   for  an  unlawful  second
   child, the levy is two to six times  the  Income  Multiplier;  where  the
   parties are in a bigamous marriage or not married, the  levy  is  six  to
   eight times the Income Multiplier; and a further multiple of three  times
   is to be added each time an additional child  is  born.   If  the  annual
   income  is  lower  than  the  Income  Multiplier  or  unknown,  then  the
   Regulations apply the Income Multiplier.

49. Under Regulation 43, if a  person  or  couple  induces  termination  for
   medically unnecessary choice of sex, falsely reports  that  a  child  has
   died or abandons, sells or disables a child or children, double  the  SUC
   in Regulation 42 will  apply,  all  certificates  to  have  children  are
   cancelled, and no further arrangements are to be made for births.

50. Workplace discipline, in addition,  will  result  in  demotion,  removal
   from positions, or dismissal according to law for those in breach of  the
   policy who are employed by the state.  Other discipline is left  to  work
   units or organisations.   They may not then work for state emanations  or
   be promoted to leading positions, and must disclose the facts if there is
   any  question  of  their   being   recommended   as   People's   Congress
   representatives, members of Villagers' (Residents') Committees or members
   of political consultative committees.

51. The rest of the Regulations deal with the penalties  for  corruption  by
   local officials and medical personnel, and the payment of all SUC to  the
   State Treasury.

Yunnan Province

52. The PFP Regulations in Yunnan province are  similar  to  that  in  Hunan
   Province. Yunnan borders on Burma on the western side of China and is  an
   area with several  ethnic  minority  groups  which  receive  preferential
   treatment for  additional  birth  permits:  those  named  in  the  family
   planning Regulations are the Derong, De'ang, Jino, Achang, Nu,  Pumi  and
   Blang peoples. The appellant's husband has his hukou in Yunnan.

53. The provisions for second children in the  agricultural  population  are
   set out in Regulations 19-21: couples are to be persuaded  to  have  only
   one child and may apply jointly in situations  of  real  hardship  for  a
   certificate for a second child. There is provision for provincial  awards
   to agricultural couples who fulfil the requirements for  a  second  child
   but choose not to exercise them.

54. Second children are permitted where one spouse is a  member  of  one  of
   the specified ethnic minorities, or, on  joint  application,  where  they
   live in a frontier village.  Where the marriage is a second marriage  for
   one spouse, but  the  other  is  marrying  for  the  first  time,  or  is
   childless, the new couple may apply to have another child,  and  widowers
   with two children are permitted a third child if the new wife has not yet
   had a child.  Giving a child up for adoption is not a permissible  reason
   for a further birth permit, but the lifelong prohibition which the  Hunan
   Regulations contain is not replicated in Yunnan.

55. Yunnan's additional honeymoon leave for late marriage is  15  days,  not
   12, but the additional maternity leave for late birth remains at 30 days,
   with 7 days of husband's leave, as before, all such leave to  be  treated
   as work.  Specific periods of leave are also prescribed for  the  various
   medical procedures which the family planning  scheme  entails.   The  SCP
   Certificate health pay is RMB 10 (�1) until the child is  fourteen,  with
   similar provisions for  social  aid  and  education  preference,  and  an
   additional 5% of old age pension, and poverty and technology support.  If
   an only child dies and its parents do not give birth to or adopt  another
   child, they retain the SCP Certificate benefits.

56. Yunnan still requires four years between approved births,  though  there
   is provision for reduction of that period to three years  in  exceptional
   circumstances.  The fine for incorrect spacing of births is  between  RMB
   200-1000 (�20-�100) for each spouse.  Birth of a second child, even  with
   official approval, entails loss of all SCP Certificate benefits.

57.   After dealing with the responsibilities of  family  planning  officers
   and medical staff, the Regulations move on to deal with  SUC,  which,  as
   before, applies to those with adopted children as well as born  children,
   and to those who are not legally  married  as  well  as  those  who  are.
   Regulation 37 requires SUC to be levied on each  spouse  separately,  and
   state employees to be dismissed. There is no  demotion  option  in  these
   Regulations.  Enterprises' labour contracts are to be cancelled.  Members
   of the agricultural community are to have no poverty support until  birth
   control measures are in place.

58. For those without SCP Certificates, there  is  no  right  to  maternity,
   paternity or honeymoon leave, no free family planning surgery,  no  state
   contribution  to  the  health  costs  of  pregnancy  and  birth,  and  no
   employment protection (Regulation 44).  Those in  breach  of  the  family
   planning scheme may not be employed  or  recruited  as  state  employees,
   promoted   to   leading   positions   in   national   authorities,   mass
   organisations, institutions or state enterprises.  The  default  must  be
   disclosed in connection with any possible selection as  a  representative
   at People's Congresses, a member of a political consultative committee or
   of  Villagers'  (Residents')  Committees.  Regulation  46  withdraws  any
   prospect of social or employment advancement and penalises  the  spouses'
   workplaces.

59. The Yunnan employment penalties differ from the Hunan scheme:  exclusion
   from public recognition and promotion is both mandatory and time-limited:

      "Regulation 46. Persons who have children in breach of the law may not
      for five years be selected as advanced or receive titles or awards  of
      honour; they may not be appointed to positions  of  responsibility  in
      Government authorities, enterprise units, State owned  enterprises  or
      enterprises in which the State is controlling shareholder,  or  social
      organisations.

      The units where persons who have children in breach of  the  law  work
      may not be selected as civilised units or  advanced  units  for  three
      years and must not be awarded any title of honour."

60. Other than that, the Yunnan provisions mirror those  of  Hunan  and  the
   national scheme.

Fujian Province

61. Fujian Province is on the eastern seaboard of China, facing Taiwan,  and
   looking out towards Japan and the Philippines.  Fujian has a tradition of
   migration and is the source of more overseas Chinese migrants (lawful  or
   unlawful) than any other province.

62. The Fujian Regulations follow the familiar scheme.  Article 9  sets  out
   categories of couples who may have an additional child:  if both  spouses
   only children; one spouse child of a martyr; couple previously  diagnosed
   as sterile who adopted a child and became pregnant; first child disabled;
   husband or wife disabled by work accident at  level  2A  or  above;  both
   spouses being returning residents from Hong Kong,  Taiwan  or  Macao  and
   residing in Fujian for less than six years;  second  marriage,  with  one
   party having a child and the other none, or one a widow  or  widower  and
   both  having  a  child  born  within  the  family  planning   rules   and
   Regulations.

63. Article 10 makes provision for  additional  second  child  possibilities
   for rural  residents:  either  spouse  being  an  only  child;  husband's
   brothers being childless and sterile; where wife has no brother  and  has
   only one sister, and the husband goes to  live  with  wife's  family  and
   supports wife's parents;  couple living  in  a  township  with  very  low
   population density (specified) and a certain amount of arable  or  forest
   land per  inhabitant  (specified);  only  one  daughter;  and  there  are
   provisions where both parties are fishermen, or where one or other  is  a
   miner and they only have a daughter.

64. Article 11 deals with returning overseas Chinese, who may  have  further
   children  if  they  arrive  pregnant;  leave  all  their  other  children
   overseas;  or have been back for less than six years.   The paragraph  is
   qualified:  one party must have returned from Hong Kong or Macao and  the
   other must have a local hukou.

65. Article 12 deals  with  national  minorities.   With  the  exception  of
   Zhuang people, where both are from a national  minority,  and  are  rural
   peasants or have worked in a national minority  township  for  over  five
   years, they may have a second child.  They may go  on  to  have  a  third
   child if either spouse is an only child, one of  their  two  children  is
   disabled, or it is a  second  marriage  with  two  children  between  the
   parties when they married.   Fujian retains the four-year  gap  rule  and
   any second child must be born when the  wife  is  over  25.   No  gap  is
   required if the wife is over 30.  The gap is dis-applied for some of  the
   prescribed circumstances, especially in relation to children  of  martyrs
   and national minorities.

66. The Fujian Regulations also permanently remove the right to  give  birth
   from anyone involved in the abandonment, giving away or illegal  adoption
   of a child, and prohibit  birth  of  children  of  extramarital  affairs.
   There are payments for restraint, longer maternity  and  paternity  leave
   (135-180 days for the wife, 7-10 for  the  husband),  extended  honeymoon
   leave (15 days), and very similar SUC rates, save that there is an  extra
   high rate for those whose children are born out of  extramarital  affairs
   (four to six times the  Income  Multiplier).   The  rest  of  the  Fujian
   Regulations are very similar to those already considered.

Guangdong Province

67. Guangdong is the next province south of Fujian, on the  coast  of  China
   but nearer to Vietnam. Its PFP Regulations follow the familiar scheme  of
   requiring the wife to have  an IUD inserted after the first birth and for
   one spouse to opt for tubal ligation after the second.  Article 49 of the
   Guangdong Regulations provides, inter alia, as follows:

      " ...The specific [collection of SUC] work shall be carried out by the
      subordinate  family  planning  operational  agency,  and  the  village
      (residents) committee and pertinent work-units  shall  assist  in  the
      execution of this work.

      -If the party in question has real difficulty paying the [SUC] in  one
      lump sum,  an application to pay in instalments may  be  submitted  in
      conformity with the law to the  body that decided on levying the  fee,
      but the period during which instalments may be  paid shall not  exceed
      three years.

      -Where a migrant gives  birth  in  a  matter  that  contravenes  these
      Regulations, the collection of the social support fee shall be done in
      accordance with national Regulations. Payment to the national treasury
      of [SUC] and late payment fines shall be  managed  under  a  two-track
      revenue and expenditure control system. No entity or individual  shall
      retain, divert, embezzle or pocket said funds."

68. It is clear that the SUC is a significant source  of  revenue  and  that
   there is concern about corruption in its collection.

Beijing and Shanghai Provinces

69.  Shanghai, a very small but influential  coastal  province,  is  further
   north than Guangdong, roughly equidistant between Fujian and the  Koreas.
   Beijing is inland, adjoining the coastal province of Tianjin,  landlocked
   between Tianjin and Hebei, in the far north of China nearer to  Mongolia.
   As regards Beijing and Shanghai, the UKBA COI Report for China 2009  says
   this:


      "28.39      On 9 August 2003 the official Xinhua news agency  reported
      that under new Regulations (effective  from  1  September  2003)  nine
      types of household in Beijing are permitted a second child. The report
      continued:


           "The nine groups that are allowed a second child include couples
           who have a disabled first child, who are the only child of their
           respective families and  currently  have  only  one  child,  and
           remarried couples who have only  one  child.  Under  the  former
           municipal Population and Birth Control Statutes,  these  couples
           could only have a second child at least  four  years  after  the
           first child was born and if the mother was  at  least  28  years
           old."


      28.40 As recorded by the same source on 13 April 2004,  Shanghai  also
      approved similar measures, which permit couples who  are  both  single
      children to have a second child. It also allows couples with  children
      from a previous  marriage  to  have  a  child  together,  as  well  as
      permitting urban couples to have a second child if one of the  spouses
      is "disabled to such an extent that it affects his or her  ability  to
      work."


      28.41 On 24 July 2009 the BBC reported, "A public information campaign
      has been  launched  [in  Shanghai]  to  highlight  exemptions  to  the
      country's one-child policy. Couples who were both only children, which
      includes most of the city's newly-weds, are allowed  a  second  child.
      The move comes as China's most populous city becomes richer and older,
      with the number of retired residents soaring...  the  current  average
      number of children born to a woman over her  lifetime  was  less  than
      one."


      28.42 On 30 September  2006  the  official  People's  Daily  newspaper
      confirmed that Beijing will not ease restrictions on  family  planning
      to  allow   people   with   higher   educational   qualifications   to
      automatically have a second child."



The Country experts

70. The application of the statutory  scheme,  which  embodies  the  current
   family planning policy, is crucial to an assessment of whether there is a
   real risk or a reasonable degree of likelihood of treatment  which  might
   require international protection.

71. We were assisted by country  evidence  from  Professor  Fu  Hualing,  Dr
   Jackie  Sheehan,  and  Professor  Mario  Aguilar,   to   assist   us   in
   understanding how the Chinese family planning scheme  works  in  practice
   and how it appears to be evolving, having regard to the  list  of  issues
   which we had defined with the parties.

Professor Mario Aguilar

72. The Tribunal had  concerns  about  the  evidence  of  Professor  Aguilar
   which, absent the opportunity to cross-examine him, reduced the value  of
   his evidence to us.  Professor Aguilar has no qualifications  in  Chinese
   law. His report did not state that he had spent any time in China or  had
   first hand knowledge of the matters on which he commented. His experience
   of China was developed within the context of a treatise on Tibet and  was
   therefore somewhat indirect and his report was un-sourced.   Although  we
   took his evidence into account,  Professor  Aguilar  did  not  give  oral
   evidence and we were able to give only limited weight  to  his  evidence,
   save where it was corroborated by other evidence or documents before us.

73. The country expertise of Professor Fu Hualing and of Dr  Jackie  Sheehan
   was accepted by both parties. Each of them had  assisted  the  AIT  in  a
   number of previous Chinese cases.  In HC and RC (Trafficked women)  China
   CG [2009] UKAIT  00027,  the  AIT  described  Dr  Sheehan  as  having  "a
   familiarity with Chinese society  which  of  course  is  helpful  in  the
   compilation of her reports" but considered that  "her  expertise  lay  in
   assembling items of background material which provided the basis for  her
   expressions of opinion, rather than having an expertise  which  gave  her
   the confidence to be able to predict what was likely to happen in a given
   situation".

Dr Jackie Sheehan

74. Dr Sheehan's evidence consisted of a main report dated 1 December  2009,
   an addendum produced on 8 December 2009 at the hearing, her oral evidence
   in December 2009, and a lengthy updated report dated  16  December  2011.
   Dr Sheehan did not produce an updated report for the hearing in  November
   2010.

75. Dr Sheehan is not a  lawyer.   Her  expertise  lies  in  collecting  and
   collating published material from China.  She speaks and writes  Mandarin
   Chinese and travels there two or three times a year.  Her  doctorate  was
   based on political and trade union issues, and a study  of  migration  to
   the United Kingdom.  Her expertise in these proceedings arises  from  her
   knowledge of developments in human rights in China.

76.  Dr  Sheehan's  report  did  not  make  the  sharp  distinction  between
   materials before and after 2005 which is found in Professor Fu's  report.
   The documents referenced in her decision mainly  date  from  the  earlier
   period.  The report made a number of unsourced, speculative  suggestions,
   such as that the appellant would  be  likely  to  be  subject  to  forced
   sterilisation or administrative detention of up to three years on return.
    Dr Sheehan did not maintain  either  of  those  positions  in  her  oral
   evidence.

77. Much of the report approached the appellant's  situation  on  the  basis
   that she would be returned as a lone woman, or a single parent,  or  that
   she had been trafficked to the United Kingdom.  The appellant is married,
   and her husband has no status in the United Kingdom,  and  it  has  never
   been her case that she was trafficked to the  United  Kingdom  or  abused
   here.

78. Dr Sheehan in her  oral  evidence  considered  that  the  snakehead  who
   helped the appellant leave China sounded like a  professional,  but  that
   his threats to the  appellant's  Chinese  children  were  probably  empty
   threats.  There was no  evidence  that  he  had  sought  to  collect  his
   outstanding fees from the appellant's parents or parents-in-law in  China
   and the level of the fee was surprisingly  low,  even  allowing  for  the
   decline in fees charged by snakeheads in the two year period 2008-2010.

79. The evidence was that the authorities no longer  refuse  to  register  a
   child on the family hukou even where it was  unauthorised.   The  Chinese
   authorities recognised that failure to register a child was punishing the
   child in a manner which was  unfair.   Parents  sometimes  did  not  seek
   registration because SUC would then have to be paid for  the  birth.   It
   was the absence of  a  hukou  which  caused  the  educational  and  other
   difficulties relied upon:  if  the  parents  were  prepared  or  able  to
   discharge the SUC  for  any  unauthorised  births,  the  child  would  be
   registered and the difficulties would not occur,  although  parents  with
   more than one child would not be  entitled  to  the  additional  benefits
   which a SCP Certificate attracted.

80. There were between 150  million  and  250  million  migrant  workers  in
   China, mostly in  the  cities.   In  general,  they  would  retain  their
   original rural or urban hukou when moving to the larger cities for  work.
   The hukou system had not been abolished.  It had been  weakened  but  its
   function in reducing the social security burden caused by rural  migrants
   in cities, by requiring them to refer to their hukou area, was still very
   important.  The resource and fiscal implications of  its  abolition  were
   huge.

81. Despite the improvements in the hukou system,  the  crucial  distinction
   between urban and rural hukou was likely  to  remain  in  place  for  the
   foreseeable future.  There had,  however,  been  modifications  since  Dr
   Sheehan had last looked at published materials on the hukou system.  Each
   person's  hukou  had  two  characteristics:    a   'rural'   or   'urban'
   designation, inherited from the  individual's  parents,  not  necessarily
   representative of their current occupation; and a  fixed  location.   The
   person was entitled to the services appropriate to the type of hukou they
   held, in the area to which that hukou was tied.  Dr  Sheehan  set  out  a
   number of points dealing with the interrelation between  hukou  and  TRP,
   for internal migrants:

   a) A number of provinces and municipalities had abolished the rural/urban
      designation but to obtain permanent status in  a  city,  and  thus  be
      entitled to the same rights and benefits as born  urban  residents,  a
      person still needed to apply for a change of hukou location.

   b) Conditions for a change of location were set by the cities, and  there
      were no longer any national conditions for permanent  migration.   The
      conditions set tended to be very restrictive,  typically  requiring  a
      relatively high level of education and money to invest in business  of
      property; or  demobilised  members  of  the  forces;  or  spouses  and
      children of those who already held an urban hukou.  Migrants might  be
      required to show a stable place of residence  (which  excluded  rented
      apartments) and a stable source of income  (which  excluded  unskilled
      casual work).  One Zhejiang city also required  five  years'  previous
      residence in the city.

   c) Shanghai required residents to have held a TRP and have  been  in  the
      city's social insurance programme for seven years, to have paid taxes,
      to have intermediate to high vocational qualifications,  and  to  have
      clean credit  and  criminal  records.   Of  six  million  migrants  in
      Shanghai, only 3000 had met the requirements so far.

   d) Beijing was reported to process only ten applications a day  for  TRPs
      and it might be several weeks before an  application  could  be  made.
      Those lacking TRPs would have  difficulty  in  finding  accommodation,
      education or  training,  banking  facilities,  registering  for  self-
      employment or social insurance  schemes,  including  pension  schemes.
      There was now no risk that they would be forcibly repatriated  to  the
      rural area. There was no relevant evidence to  indicate  that  current
      custody and repatriation centres were as poor as those before 2003. Dr
      Sheehan considered that if there  were,  international  sources  would
      have reported it. Forged TRPs were an option  but  were  difficult  to
      counterfeit.

82. The present appellant was not a highly educated woman, which  restricted
   her opportunities in a city, were  she  to  migrate  internally.  If  she
   sought to move to a city and obtain a TRP, but  would  need  a  character
   reference from police in her hukou area, which meant that she would  have
   to regularise her position first and as she would probably be expected to
   attend personally at the police station in Hunan, her additional children
   would be disclosed.  Even if  living  in  a  city,  she  would  still  be
   required to undergo regular pregnancy tests:  some local family  planning
   officials, having had experience of falsified pregnancy tests from  local
   women who had migrated elsewhere, now required them to return home and be
   tested in the hukou area.  It was unclear from Dr Sheehan's  report  what
   the enforcement mechanism would be if the appellant did not comply.

83. Although there were well-publicised outbreaks of unlawful  behaviour  by
   local officials, particularly the Linyi  scandal,  Dr  Sheehan  had  been
   unable to find any reports of forced sterilisations  in  Hunan  province.
   Some provinces  imposed  sharply  increasing  fines  for  failure  to  be
   sterilised, for example Jiujiang  in  Jiangxi,  but  she  had  not  found
   evidence of such fines in Hunan.  Nor had she been able to establish that
   the charge increased for each additional child.

84. However, absence of evidence was not  evidence  of  absence,  since  the
   information  about  women's  fertility  was  treated   by   the   Chinese
   authorities as a state secret.  In practice, it was much harder  to  keep
   incidents secret, since the advent of camera phones.  The case of Arzigul
   Tursun in Xianjiang province was a case in point: the mother, a member of
   an ethnic minority, was pregnant with what  she  considered  a  permitted
   third child.  Attempts to force her to abort the baby were stopped  after
   the intervention of two members of the United  States  Congress  and  the
   American Ambassador.  Local officials complained that  3000  more  babies
   had been born in defiance of abortion orders in the months that followed,
   described by them as 'American babies'.

85. Dr Sheehan's evidence on the legal enforcement of SUC  was  speculative.
   She did not know how it worked; she was not a lawyer  and  accepted  that
   she could not gainsay Professor Fu's evidence on this area.  Nor was  she
   able to say whether the appellant would be entitled to the provisions for
   'overseas Chinese'.  The  evidence  was  confused  on  this  point:   the
   original meaning of the  phrase  referred  to  Chinese  who  had  settled
   abroad, but her literature survey did  not  indicate  that  in  practice,
   those who were first-generation migrants whose status was  not  'settled'
   in the country of migration were excluded.

86.  Dr  Sheehan  agreed  that  there  was  a  massive  publicity   campaign
   supporting the family planning scheme.  She did not  consider  it  likely
   that the appellant could have been unaware  of  her  rights  and  duties.
   There would have been posters around her village with  positive  messages
   about small families and girl children, and she had  seen  lists  on  the
   walls of village schools, listing every married woman  in  the  area  and
   when she was next entitled  to  apply  for  a  birth  permit  and  become
   pregnant.

87. The penalty for unauthorised foreign  travel  was  confiscation  of  the
   travel document, a fine of between RMB 500  -  RMB  2000  (�50-�200)  and
   possibly a short period of detention, up to 14 days. Young children could
   remain with their mother during detention; the authorities would look for
   relatives or grandparents to care for them if that was  not  appropriate,
   and there was no 'Looked After Children' system in China.

Supplementary report of Dr Sheehan

88. On 16 December 2011, Dr Sheehan prepared a supplementary report  dealing
   with the fact set as it now stood:  that the appellant was now a  married
   woman, with two children born by her husband, albeit before her marriage.
    She was asked to  deal  with  the  likelihood  that  these  foreign-born
   children would be registered, the cost of registration  to  obtain  hukou
   for them, the consequences of non-payment, whether  the  appellant  would
   benefit from the overseas Chinese exemption provisions; and the  risk  to
   her of compulsory sterilisation as the mother of four children.

89. Dr Sheehan did not consider that the appellant could  benefit  from  the
   overseas Chinese exemption, since  her  children  were  born  before  she
   married  their  father.   That  statement  is  not  sourced.   She   also
   considered that the SUC would be very high because  neither  child  would
   count as 'authorised' since they  were  conceived  and  born  before  the
   parties married. Subsequent marriage would  not  authorise  the  children
   retrospectively.

90. The risk could not be averted by internal  relocation,  since  the  same
   system, with local variations,  applied  everywhere.  The  appellant  had
   neither sought nor received a birth permit for the second  child  and  Dr
   Sheehan considered that she would be liable to a significant fine of  6-8
   times her previous year's income.  Based on average local income,  as  it
   would be, the fine could be as much as RMB 68726 for both  births  (about
   �6873).  The family would have to make a down payment of at least half of
   that and would have to pay the rest, if they could, within  three  years.
   There was anecdotal evidence of collection  of  any  outstanding  balance
   over up to a decade by local officials, although that appears to be ultra
   vires the Regulations.   The gravity of the offence is approached  by  Dr
   Sheehan on the basis that these are  the  appellant's  third  and  fourth
   children, which we have not accepted.

91. Dr Sheehan set out Article 53 of the  1997  Criminal  Law,  which  deals
   with defaulters, but that is a return to her original error.  SUC is  not
   a criminal penalty but a civil one.   She reviewed the country  materials
   which we discuss later in this decision.  She considered that  the  level
   of local abuses remained high and that there were  incentives  for  local
   officials to enforce the policy.

92. She considered it  overwhelmingly  likely  that  the  appellant  as  the
   mother of four children would be forced to undergo sterilisation,  either
   by social and  personal  pressure,  or  if  there  were  a  sterilisation
   campaign in her area, by force.  If the appellant were permitted to  have
   an IUD inserted instead, there was a high failure rate (10% in the  first
   year and 20% in  the  second)  which  might  well  result  in  a  further
   pregnancy which the appellant would certainly be required or compelled to
   abort.

93. Dr Sheehan's report went through the country evidence in detail.   Where
   it agreed with her underlying thesis she adopted it but where it did not,
   she criticised it as based on  inadequate  information.   She  considered
   that the education and healthcare system outside the SCP Certificate  was
   unaffordable,  especially  to  families  who  were  also  paying  off   a
   substantial SUC.   She  considered  that  the  risk  of  the  appellant's
   children being taken from her and put up for illegal adoption  cannot  be
   ruled out.

94. Dr Sheehan reminded us of the 2005  Linyi  scandal  and  the  continuing
   house arrest of Chen Guangcheng, the  families'  blind  lawyer.   He  was
   continuing to suffer physical abuse on occasion and was under very  tight
   restrictions.   His wife had made a secret film, available on the net, of
   the      conditions       in       which       they       were       held
   (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTagQK4uGzY).  Both had subsequently been
   beaten.  Their son was staying with relatives in another county  and  was
   able to attend school:  their six year old daughter was living with  them
   and prevented by their house arrest from being educated.  Only Mr  Chen's
   mother was allowed to leave the house to work in the garden.  Attempts to
   visit them at their home in Shandong  province  by  foreign  journalists,
   Chinese lawyers and human rights  campaigners,  and  the  American  actor
   Christian Bale, had been prevented  by  dozens  of  guards,  some  armed.
   Abuses to compel pregnant women to terminate pregnancies  were  occurring
   again in Linyi.   A women's rights campaigner, Mao  Hengfeng,  herself  a
   victim of a forced abortion  in  the  1990s,  was  continuing  to  suffer
   detentions and abuse, the latest resulting in her unexpected release in a
   wheelchair in July 2011.  Dr Sheehan argued that with  such  high-profile
   abuse of whistleblowers, absence of  evidence  in  other  areas  was  not
   evidence of absence of abuses.

95. Much of the relevant information remained classified as a state  secret,
   including the levels of  induced  terminations,  infanticide,  and  child
   abandonment.  The report continued:

      "52.   ...The  combined  5th  and  6th  Periodic  Report   [on   CEDAW
      implementation  in  the  PRC]  provides   few   details   on   women's
      reproductive  rights  beyond  maternal  and  infant  health.   Despite
      requests  and   recommendations   from   the   Committee   and   other
      international human rights  monitoring  bodies,  individual  cases  of
      abuse continue to be documented, and may represent a much larger  body
      of similar occurrences.  The experts  who  gave  evidence  to  the  US
      Congressional-Executive Committee on China  [CECC]  in  2002  conceded
      that it was impossible to generalize from the relatively small  number
      of well-documented cases as to  how  widespread  coercion  and  abuses
      remained after the passing of the Family Planning Law that  year,  but
      all agreed that verifiable cases  continued  to  occur.   Indeed,  the
      Shandong  and  Guangxi  cases  of  widespread  abuses   and   coercive
      enforcement of family-planning Regulations have  both  occurred  since
      2002, and both  cases  were  attributed  to  pressure  on  lower-level
      officials to  meet  birth-quota  targets,  something  which  the  2002
      passing of the Family Planning Law was supposed to ease."

96. There is no analysis of the later US CECC  reports.  The  Shandong/Linyi
   and Guanxi cases occurred in 2005.   The report goes on to  consider  the
   2010 census amnesty for unregistered children (the census ended in 2011).
    There had been amnesties also in the 1990 and  2000  censuses,  although
   the  information  was  passed  in  some  cases  to  the  family  planning
   authorities and SUC or other penalties were imposed.

97. Dr Sheehan was sceptical of the claimed opportunity in the  2010  census
   to declare additional unregistered children without the information being
   passed to the  family  planning  authorities  for  enforcement.   Similar
   offers had been made in the previous  two  censuses  but  SUC  and  other
   penalties had been imposed on many women.

98. She noted that the opportunity had now passed  for  additional  children
   to be declared, since the census was complete.     She concluded that:

      "55.  ...The fact that the Chinese government's estimate of the number
      of people still  not hukou registered has increased so  much  (from  8
      million to 13 million) between the 2000 and 2010 censuses suggests  to
      me that the claimed amnesties have had little effect.  In any case, an
      'amnesty' for those who are only prevented from registering  by  their
      inability to pay a large fine is  of  no  use  to  someone  like  [the
      appellant] given her likely earnings in rural Hunan.  Coverage of  the
      'amnesty' states that fines were temporarily reduced,  not  abolished,
      and that migrants in major cities like Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai
      took up the opportunity.  These migrants would have had a much  higher
      earning capacity, even as temporary residents of China's  biggest  and
      most prosperous cities, than  [the  appellant]  would  have  in  rural
      Hunan, and in any case, the census and the amnesty, such  as  it  was,
      are over."

99. Dr Sheehan dealt, finally, with the position of single mothers, in  case
   the appellant's husband did not return with her.  The 1987  Passport  Law
   of the People's Republic of China stated that those who were returned  to
   China for illegally leaving the People's Republic of China  or  illegally
   living or working abroad would not be entitled to a passport for a period
   between six months and three years.  The appellant would be  the  subject
   of rumours and gossip and would find life 'extremely  difficult'  on  her
   own. Many women in that situation married to obtain social inclusion such
   as education and healthcare. The appellant did  not  have  the  necessary
   educational and skill qualifications for temporary residence in  a  major
   city like Beijing or Shanghai.

Professor Fu Hualing

100. Professor Fu's evidence focused on  the  Chinese  law  materials.   His
   report did not  look  to  international  human  rights  organisations  or
   reports, which we considered separately.  Professor  Fu  is  an  academic
   lawyer and a practitioner, who has provided the Tribunal with  the  legal
   provisions under which the policy operates,  as  well  as  searching  the
   university database  for  reported  cases.   The  legal  provisions  have
   already been summarised.  He emphasised that unauthorised births  were  a
   civil matter and did not entail any criminal offence:  to force  a  woman
   to abort her child would be a criminal offence by the  officer  involved,
   though he did not produce any evidence of criminal prosecutions for  such
   conduct.  Violent obstruction of, or threats to family planning officials
   in the execution of their duties was a criminal  offence.  There  was  no
   equivalent to the common-law concept of an injunction in Chinese law, and
   no way to restrain impending abuse.  Judicial review was the only  remedy
   and there was in practice no legal aid available.

101. His research on the Peking University  database,  www.chinalawinfo.com,
   had  produced  about  fifty  family  planning  related  judicial   review
   decisions, but only six of those are before us.   Professor  Fu's  report
   indicated that the focus in judicial review cases was on due process  and
   proper procedures in the imposition of the SUC.   Two  of  the  cases  he
   produced were before the change from punishment to  financial  penalties,
   and  illustrated  exactly  why  the  Chinese  authorities  considered  it
   necessary to do so.  The claimants were mainly men of property.   If  the
   cases we have seen are a proportionate sample of the fifty cases  on  the
   database, they do indicate that the Chinese courts, when  accessed,  will
   quash unlawful approaches to the SUC by local officials and  order  costs
   and restitution.

102. Local authorities made a great deal of  money  from  SUC  payments  and
   birth permits.  SUC would also be imposed on  mothers  of  children  born
   outside marriage (even first children), but the rates  were  much  lower.
   Awareness was high:  enforcement, generally, limited to fines.

103.  The  position  regarding   termination   of   pregnancies   was   less
   satisfactory.   Persuasion  and  financial  measures  were  lawful,   but
   forcible termination was not.  The law required informed  consent  before
   an abortion was carried out. Some provincial family planning  Regulations
   were prescriptive:  Hubei, Anhui, Heilongjian and Jiangsu required prompt
   termination of any unauthorised pregnancy.   Jiangsu  required  abortions
   only where medically permissible.  Hunan, Hainan  and  Zhejiang  required
   the collection of a deposit,  returnable  after  the  abortion  had  been
   performed (RMB 200-10000, equivalent to �20-�1000).  Hunan  and  Liaoning
   required  the  work  unit  and  village/residents'  committee  to  compel
   termination.

104. In his opinion, while there had been  brutal  and  violent  enforcement
   cases, they were exceptional and the numbers were declining.  The  courts
   were prepared to hold local family planning officers  liable  in  damages
   where family planning powers had  been  abused.  In  his  oral  evidence,
   Professor Fu was asked about the scandals  in  Linyi  city  (in  Shandong
   province) and in Guangxi Province, both of which occurred in  2005,  just
   after enforcement recommenced.   They were shocking:  in  Shandong  as  a
   whole, which was very substantially over its quota, with Linyi  the  city
   with the highest number  of  unauthorised  births  in  China  that  year,
   international reports suggested that the family  planning  officials  had
   forcibly sterilised at least 7000 persons (male and female) and  detained
   130,000  for  forcible  abortions  or  sterilisations.   A   lawyer   who
   represented the families of those affected was imprisoned and persecuted.
    He had only recently been released.  In Guangxi,  when  family  planning
   officials tried to enforce a  forcible  abortion  policy,  the  villagers
   rebelled and there was a widely-reported violent clash between  villagers
   and local police.

105. Professor Fu  considered  that  these  incidents  were  isolated:   the
   authorities were now extremely cautious  about  using  force  to  enforce
   either termination or sterilisation.  Such behaviour had been  much  more
   common in the 1980s  under  the  earlier  policy.    Some  provinces  now
   offered  payments  to  poor  families  as  an  incentive  for   voluntary
   sterilisation.

106. The multiples of the Income Multiplier set for each unauthorised  child
   increased:  however, SUC enforcement was restricted  in  practice,  since
   Chinese law did not permit civil judgments to be enforced so as to remove
   the basic conditions of living (a home, food on the table, and  schooling
   for the children).

107. Returning asylum seekers would be investigated to  establish  how  they
   had left China. That would involve establishing  where  they  held  their
   hukou and checking whether there were any  outstanding  criminal  charges
   against them.  A one-way travel document would be issued only when  those
   checks were complete.  On return, the person would  be  briefly  detained
   and questioned at the border, to verify their identity,  then  fined  and
   their travel documents confiscated, barring them from further travel  for
   three years.  If there were  any  outstanding  criminal  charges  against
   them, they would be escorted back to that local authority; otherwise, the
   returnee would be allowed to proceed unless there was an instruction from
   'high-ranking officials' or they were involved in a significant case,  in
   which circumstances they would be escorted back to the area  where  their
   hukou was held.

108. The penalty for illegal exit would usually be administrative  detention
   for not more than five days and a fine up to RMB 500 (�50),  with  higher
   fines for remaining outside China unlawfully, depending on when the  last
   valid travel document expired.

109. Once properly identified by overseas birth  certificates,  foreign-born
   children  would  now  be  registered.   Whether  they  were  regarded  as
   unauthorised was controversial:  a  Guangdong  spokesman  indicated  that
   they were, but a family planning official in Hainan  province  considered
   that parents of an unauthorised foreign-born child would not be punished.



Professor Fu's supplementary report

110.  In  a  supplementary  report  prepared  in  June  2011,  Professor  Fu
   responded to the appellant's new  material.   He  confirmed  that  family
   planning enforcement had been stepped up in early 2010, particularly  for
   migrants with rural hukous working in  cities.   There  were  150  -  200
   million such migrants, who lived, studied and worked in cities where they
   had no legal right to do so.  Conditions for migrant workers had improved
   vastly compared with the past, although  they  were  still  discriminated
   against.  The improvements came  from  a  series  of  alleviative  policy
   initiatives in relation to work and study in cities.

111. There had always  been  cases  in  which  force  was  used  to  enforce
   abortion and sterilisation, where unauthorised  pregnancy  was  detected,
   but the medical profession in China had become increasingly  independent,
   with doctors aware of their own  duties  and  responsibilities,  and  the
   legal liability for any operation performed without patient consent.  The
   hospital, as the doctor's employer, would also  be  legally  responsible.
   There had been a decline in the direct application  of  force.    He  was
   aware of the case of Li Hongmei in Anhui, but overall the  new  materials
   did not suggest an increase in violent enforcement of the family planning
   scheme, which continued to be enforced mainly by financial penalty.

Submissions

112. For the respondent,  Mr  Johnson  challenged  the  credibility  of  the
   appellant's evidence about her life in China, her  husband  and  children
   there, and her journey to the United Kingdom.   There  were  glaring  and
   unanswerable issues  of  credibility  affecting  central  themes  in  the
   appellant's evidence:  it was for us to assess the overall credibility of
   that evidence.    He  asked  us  to  place  very  little  weight  on  the
   appellant's account, to find that her account of her  marriage  in  China
   was fabricated, and that the only children the appellant had were the two
   born in the United Kingdom.

113.  Mr Johnson  directed  us  to  the  appellant's  account  as  given  to
   Immigration Judge FitzGibbon (as he then  was).   He  argued  that  on  a
   number of central themes, the  appellant's  evidence  was  glaringly  and
   unanswerably discrepant:

      (a)   Conflict as to the extent to which the appellant  was  aware  of
      the  family  planning  scheme  when  living  in  China.   It  was  the
      appellant's consistent evidence that until the very last day she spent
      in China, she had not been aware  of  those  rules,  but  the  country
      evidence was that the policy was very widely and thoroughly publicised
      throughout the appellant's life.  He reminded us that both Dr  Sheehan
      and Professor Fu agreed  on  that.   The  publicity  included  picture
      posters and was designed to reach both literate and illiterate  women,
      given its overwhelming importance in the eyes of  the  Chinese  state.
      Women of childbearing age with whom the appellant worked talked  about
      it and, on the appellant's evidence, steps  were  taken  to  keep  her
      second child's birth secret;

      (b)   The appellant's  evidence  regarding  the  reasons  her  Chinese
      partner or husband left  her  had  varied  across  her  accounts.   At
      different times she had said that he left to obtain work,  because  he
      was having an affair, or  to  escape  sterilisation.   None  of  those
      reasons  stood  up  to  scrutiny:   had  he  been  leaving  to  escape
      sterilisation or to seek work elsewhere,  Mr  Johnson  submitted  that
      there would have  been  discussions  between  the  appellant  and  her
      husband before he left.

   c) The evidence about how the appellant  discovered  the  affair  varied:
      sometimes she said a neighbour told her, sometimes her  mother-in-law,
      and on one occasion, that while  she  was  in  prison  in  the  United
      Kingdom she remembered a woman coming to the house  in  China  looking
      for her husband.

      (d)   There were similar, serious difficulties in her account of where
      she had met the agent who arranged the journey to the  United  Kingdom
      and from whom she had borrowed the money for the  down  payment.   The
      cost was surprisingly low, given that there was no allegation  of  any
      element of trafficking, and the appellant's  account  that  the  agent
      would know how to find her, without her having his name or address  in
      the United Kingdom, was very difficult to credit. The Tribunal  should
      disbelieve her account of receiving a demand while in  prison  in  the
      United Kingdom but not retaining the letter.  There was no evidence of
      the appellant trying to repay the  person  who  lent  her  RMB  20,000
      (�2000) in China.

      (e)   As regards the passport on which the appellant left China, there
      was a flat inconsistency in her original interview over a short period
      of time as to what passport she  used  and  whether  it  was  lost  or
      destroyed.  The explanation in the appellant's  latest  oral  evidence
      that there had been a second passport given to her to  enable  her  to
      get on the plane was frankly incredible.

      (f)   It was also very surprising that her husband did  not  know  the
      ages of the putative Chinese children.  Although the parties had  been
      married for a relatively short time, they  had  been  together  for  a
      number of years, the appellant had discussed her children  and  stated
      that she missed them.  He claimed also not to know which province  she
      came from in China.  These were matters which one would expect him  to
      have learned from the appellant.

114. Overall, the appellant was not a credible witness and  he  invited  the
   Tribunal to disbelieve her account of  events  in  China  entirely.   The
   appellant was therefore not to be treated as a person with four  children
   and at risk of forcible sterilisation in her hukou area, but one who  had
   only two children both born in the United Kingdom.

115. In relation to the expert evidence, Mr Johnson asked  the  Tribunal  to
   prefer the evidence of Professor Fu and of Dr Sheehan to  the  report  of
   Professor Aguilar, which, absent the opportunity  to  cross-examine  him,
   was almost entirely  unsourced,  out  of  step  with  the  other  country
   evidence, and unhelpful. He submitted that the Tribunal  should  give  it
   very little weight. Absent the ability to test the  report  of  Professor
   Aguilar, which was almost entirely devoid of reference  to  its  sources,
   the Tribunal should not give his  evidence  any  significant  weight,  in
   particular since parts of it flatly contradicted the careful evidence  of
   Professor Fu.   Professor Aguilar had no particular expertise in relation
   to China or its family planning scheme,  his  field  of  expertise  being
   religion and politics in Tibet.

116. The evidence showed relatively few instances  of  widespread  abuse  of
   pregnant women after 2005, the Linyi scandal  being  earlier  than  that.
   Forcible sterilisation was unlawful, as Professor Fu's  evidence  showed.
   The Tribunal should find that although the fines required for an unlawful
   birth were significant, the enforcement was linked to the ability to pay,
   both as to the fines themselves and as to payment.  The consequences were
   not criminal prosecution but  civil  enforcement:   the  Tribunal  should
   accept Professor Fu's evidence that there was no real  risk  of  forcible
   sterilisation, detention, or destitution on these facts.

117. Dr Sheehan's evidence should be treated with a degree  of  caution,  as
   set out by the Tribunal in HC and RC:

      "...As a researcher and teacher of contemporary Chinese studies and as
      a result of her visits to the PRC she clearly has a  familiarity  with
      Chinese society which of course is helpful in the compilation  of  her
      reports. In her oral evidence she told us that on her  last  visit  to
      China she spent time examining documents which might well  have  given
      her a degree of expertise assessing the genuineness of documents.   We
      did have the impression, however, that more  generally  her  expertise
      lay in assembling items of  background  material  which  provided  the
      basis for her expressions of opinion, rather than having an  expertise
      which gave her the confidence to be able to predict what was likely to
      happen in a given situation."


118. Dr  Sheehan,  he  submitted,  was  given  to  rather  sweeping  general
   statements, which necessarily affected  the  weight  which  the  Tribunal
   could give her evidence.

119. Professor Fu's evidence, on the other hand was balanced, and  objective
   in the best sense. He was an independent witness whose evidence could  be
   accepted and his evidence was that there was no real risk on  return  for
   this appellant of treatment infringing either Convention.  Professor Fu's
   evidence was consistent with the objective material, both electronic  and
   in the country bundle.

120. The evidence was that there were  200,000  children  born  unauthorised
   each year and if abuses existed  they  would  be  very  well  documented.
   Particularly with modern technological advances,  it  was  impossible  to
   silence the families of so many  individuals;  instances  of  abuse  were
   reported, for example, the scandal at Linyi received prompt and prominent
   attention  round  the  world.   Strikingly  few   instances   of   forced
   sterilisation or abusive family planning measures had been reported since
   then.   The US State Department for 2008 reported only a single  instance
   of forced sterilisation in the whole of China in  that  year.   The  UKBA
   Country of  Origin  Reports  for  2005-2007  indicated  that  there  were
   isolated problems but no pattern amounting to a real risk of persecution.

121. Legal remedies  were  available  where  local  officials  abused  their
   powers; they were imperfect, and there were difficulties with  legal  aid
   and accessing experienced lawyers but they did exist and the courts  were
   prepared to enforce the  remedies.   Professor  Fu's  examples  supported
   that.

122. In relation to whether  there  was  an  applicable  Refugee  Convention
   reason, Mr Johnson noted that the appellant did not seek to  present  her
   breach of the family  planning  scheme  as  arising  from  her  political
   opinion, religious belief, or wish to defy the Chinese authorities.    He
   contended that it was unhelpful to consider the risk to her,  and  others
   like her, as arising from perceived political opinion, since the  country
   evidence clearly pointed to the abuses being based  upon  over-enthusiasm
   for targets by local party officials, rather than politics.

123. However, Mr Johnson accepted  that  the  identified  particular  social
   group, "women who gave birth in breach of China's family planning scheme"
   existed, and had the required characteristic of immutability.  The family
   planning rules were not an expression of a political philosophy but of  a
   strategic and practical necessity, and  their  breach  was  perceived  as
   conduct which put China's strategic and practical aims  at  risk.   Women
   who  had  unauthorised  children  were  subject  to  collective  economic
   punishment based on the prejudice such births caused to  one  of  China's
   most vital social measures.

124. If  the  Tribunal  found  that  there  was  a  real  risk  of  forcible
   sterilisation,  Mr  Johnson  accepted  that  such  treatment   would   be
   persecutory, as defined by the  Refugee  Convention,  by  reason  of  the
   parties' membership of the particular social group identified above,  and
   such treatment would also be a breach of Article 3 ECHR.

125. Turning  to  the  disposal  of  the  present  appeal,  the  appellant's
   evidence as to what occurred in China was of low credibility and even  to
   the standard applicable to the international protection  Conventions  she
   had not shown that she had children in China.  The Tribunal  should  find
   that the appellant would be returning to  China  as  the  mother  of  two
   children, a girl and a boy.  She and her husband were both only  children
   and thus  were,  despite  their  Han  ethnicity,  entitled  to  have  two
   children.  The children having been born  outside  China,  there  was  no
   question of registration being  refused,  or  of  breach  of  the  family
   planning scheme in their home province leading to sanctions.   There  was
   also no real risk of physical force being  used  now  to  achieve  family
   planning ends. For those reasons alone, this appeal should  fail  and  in
   the generality of cases, other appeals should not succeed on this basis.

126. The likelihood  was  that  the  appellant  and  her  husband  would  be
   required to pay a fine of between RMB 500-2000 (�50-�200).  He relied  on
   the evidence of Professor Fu regarding ability to pay and the  limits  of
   enforcement.  There might well be difficulties  in  accessing  education,
   social care, and health care if the children were unregistered,  but  the
   evidence did not support a finding that they would not be registered.  If
   the  Chinese  children  existed,  the  question  whether  they  had  been
   registered already was one of fact unaffected by the appellant's marriage
   and additional children born in the  United  Kingdom.   Accordingly,  her
   return to China would not negatively affect their position.

127. Turning to Article 8 ECHR, the  appellant  was  now  a  married  woman,
   whose husband was also a Chinese citizen with no status or right to be in
   the United Kingdom.  Her United Kingdom born  children  would  return  to
   China with their mother and it would be a matter for the parties, and  in
   particular for her  husband,  whether  he  returned  with  his  wife  and
   children.   There  were  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family   life
   continuing in China as it had in  the  United  Kingdom  thus  far.    Any
   interference with the Article 8 right to respect for private  and  family
   life enjoyed by this appellant, her children and her  husband  should  be
   regarded as proportionate, having regard to the importance of maintaining
   immigration  control.   The  parties  had  met,  and  the  children  been
   conceived, when the husband's asylum claim had already been  refused  and
   the appellant herself had no right to  be  in  the  United  Kingdom;  the
   parties knew that they were in a precarious position.

128. If returned with two children, Professor Fu's evidence  was  that  such
   return would not trigger the  administrative  consequences  of  breaching
   family planning rules.  The likelihood was that they would be subject  to
   a fine on return, since the existence of the children would be obvious at
   the airport when the parties arrived, but  despite  the  relatively  high
   levels of such fines, the fine should not  be  regarded  as  persecutory.
   Chinese law provided that if the parties could not pay, then it would not
   be enforced, since the Chinese civil enforcement rules, like those of the
   United Kingdom, required the courts to allow  the  parties  to  retain  a
   basic minimum income, allowing them to provide food, a home and education
   for the children.

129. Mr Johnson  accepted  that  the  husband's  case  was  currently  under
   consideration  outside  the  Immigration  Rules,  and   the   appellant's
   representatives had made written  submissions  which  would  need  to  be
   considered at the same time. If and only if the Tribunal were to consider
   that returning the appellant without her husband would breach Article  8,
   the Secretary of State would be prepared to undertake not to  return  the
   appellant to China unless or until the husband's further submissions  had
   been dealt with and rejected.  In such a case, the Tribunal should  allow
   the appeal but leave it to the Secretary of State to grant a short period
   of discretionary leave and/or deal extremely swiftly with  the  husband's
   legacy application.

130. For the appellant, Mr Symes said that his instructing  solicitors  were
   not instructed by the husband on his  asylum  appeal,  though  they  were
   dealing with the legacy application made outside the Rules in 2009.   The
   husband's  asylum  claim  had  already  been  finally  determined.    The
   representations under consideration were based on a fear of incarceration
   as a former asylum seeker.   No other reason was relied upon.

131. The appellant should be treated as a  credible  witness,  although  she
   had not found it easy to give a consistent account.  Some of the negative
   credibility points were based on answers given by the  appellant  in  her
   screening interview, when she was fresh off the plane and what  she  said
   had  not  been  read  back  to  her.   The  appellant  had  been  legally
   represented by Luqmani Thompson only since lodging her asylum appeal.

132. As to  the  discrepancies  relied  upon,  the  appellant  had  provided
   explanations for some of them.  She had not been aware, before coming  to
   the United Kingdom, that her customary marriage in  China  had  no  legal
   effect, leaving her free to marry again here without any  formalities  in
   relation to the Chinese 'marriage'.  As to the distances and  time  taken
   to reach the ''the town', that could be  explained  by  one  journey,  to
   Jinji, being 30 minutes by bicycle and the other, to the  different  city
   where the agent lived, being two days on foot.

133. In relation to the claimed risks in China arising out of events  there,
   he relied on his skeleton  argument.   The  appellant  had  breached  the
   spacing requirement between children, even if two children were permitted
   because they were a 'double-single' couple.  There was  a  real  risk  of
   financial penalties for those births.

134. The key distinction in China was between those  with  urban  and  rural
   hukous.  No province could properly be regarded as more or less likely to
   enforce the policy in an abusive  manner.   There  was  evidence  of  one
   attempt to enforce the policy on a  visitor  from  Hong  Kong,  in  Hunan
   province which was the appellant's home province.  The evidence was that,
   from time to time, a rash of official activity surfaced, as  set  out  in
   the report of Louisa Lim in 2007 regarding Guangxi  Province,  the  Linyi
   city incident (Shandong Province) in early 2005,  and  the  discovery  of
   coercion in the supposedly 'Model'  Sihui Country programme.

135. Even if the children  born  in  the  United  Kingdom  were  within  the
   permitted quota, they had been born close together and did not  meet  the
   birth spacing rules still applicable in some states.  In  Hunan,  and  in
   much of China, those rules were no longer strictly applied, as set out in
   the US State Department Report, but the two children born in  the  United
   Kingdom were  born  in  2005  and  2008,  before  the  abolition  of  the
   requirement for spacing.  If born when the appellant was  in  China,  the
   second birth would definitely have been treated as 'unauthorised'.    The
   appellant would have to pay a fine to register the second  birth.    They
   were unlikely to earn the 'inward brain drain' second  child  reward  for
   those returning from abroad.  Dr Sheehan's evidence  was  that  returning
   with  more  than  one  child  could  give  rise  to  a  risk  of   forced
   sterilisation. Absence of evidence was not evidence of  absence  in  this
   context:  the Chinese Government regarded it as important to keep  forced
   sterilisations a state secret.

136. The Tribunal should treat the evidence of Professor Fu  with  a  degree
   of caution on the question of  sufficiency  of  protection.  Although  he
   mentioned the Linyi incident, the only  sources  he  cited  were  Chinese
   publications and legal provisions.   He had not considered  reports  from
   international NGOs and there was arguably an element  of  self-censorship
   in his report.  Where his  assertions  were  not  sourced,  the  Tribunal
   should not give them weight.  Professor Fu's unsourced word should  carry
   no more weight than that of Dr Sheehan.  For example, he made no  mention
   of birth spacing, although the US State Department Report emphasised that
   element of the policy.

137. The evidence of a remedy provided by the six  cases  Professor  Fu  had
   found did not amount to sufficiency of protection:  in each case, actions
   for damages and retraining  of  officials  were  taken  by  male  Chinese
   citizens after the event. There was no concept of injunction  in  Chinese
   law enabling parties to restrain local officials from  acting  unlawfully
   in advance.     Access  to  courts  in  China  was  restricted,  both  by
   financial considerations and because of  the  lack  of  access  to  legal
   advice.  There were approximately 20 lawyers to  a  county  of  almost  a
   million inhabitants, legal aid was not in practice available, unless  one
   were destitute, and judicial review applications could only  be  made  on
   payment of a fee.   The litigants in the cases found by Professor Fu were
   people of substance, shop owners  and  businessmen,  not  persons  facing
   destitution.

138.  Access to justice was not easy for a floating  migrant.   One  of  the
   examples  was  a  settled  husband  with  a  migrant  wife  who  had   an
   unauthorised baby, where he complained successfully  of  the  actions  of
   urban family planning officials who confiscated the  family's  television
   and video recorder, and detained the wife for 4.5 hours, at  the  end  of
   which she fell from the 7th floor of a building and was so badly  injured
   that in due course she died.   Damages were not an  effective  remedy  in
   that situation.

139. The meaning of  forced  sterilisation  in  Chinese  terms  was  narrow.
   Professor Fu  confirmed  that  there  were  social  pressures,  including
   harassment and threats, to persuade people to  become  sterilised.   From
   the Chinese point of view, only  being  strapped  down  and  operated  on
   against your will counted as 'forced sterilisation'.

140. Internal relocation was impractical since wherever a person went,  they
   would need to involve the home province.  He invited the Tribunal to make
   findings on the  availability  of  internal  relocation.   In  the  AIT's
   country guidance decision, HC and RC, it  relied  on  evidence  from  the
   Canadian IRB concerning the reform of the hukou system.  However,  recent
   evidence from the same source indicated that  the  system  had  not  been
   completely  relaxed,  and  that  migrants  still  required  a   character
   reference from the  police  in  their  original  hukou  zone.   That  was
   unlikely to be forthcoming here.

International case law

141. The Tribunal requested the parties to assist us by  producing  relevant
   decisions of other  international  courts  on  the  risk  to  parents  of
   unauthorised  children.    We  had  the  benefit  of  a  wide  range   of
   international materials, including case law from Australia, New  Zealand,
   and Canada.  The United States case law was less  apposite,  particularly
   in the light  of  a  statutory  presumption  in  American  law  that  any
   requirement to limit reproduction is persecutory. We  have  not  examined
   the international authorities on trafficking, which were included  for  a
   linked appeal which  did  not  proceed.   Refugee  Appeal  No.  76044,  a
   September 2008 decision of the Refugee Status Appeals  Authority  in  New
   Zealand, concerned the availability of internal relocation  to  women  at
   risk of honour killings in Turkey.  It is an analysis, by  Rodger  Haines
   QC, of the law concerning internal relocation but adds nothing particular
   to the present appeal.

142. Some of the materials produced dealt only with the meaning  of  refugee
   status and/or the definition of  particular  social  group.  The  law  on
   particular social group in  the  United  Kingdom  is  now  settled.   The
   Tribunal is bound by the decision of the House of Lords in  Secretary  of
   State for the Home Department v. K, Fornah v Secretary of State  for  the
   Home Department [2006] UKHL 46 (K and Fornah). In any event, we  note  Mr
   Johnson's acceptance, on the respondent's behalf, that if we were to find
   that there was a real risk of persecution, there  existed  an  applicable
   Refugee  Convention  reason  (particular  social  group  as  defined   in
   paragraph 123 above).

143. Many of the international cases draw a distinction between the  Chinese
   family planning scheme as a law of general application, which  would  not
   be  innately  persecutory,  and  its  implementation,  which   might   be
   persecutory either generally or in specific ways or areas.  The  relevant
   case law dealing with issues in the  present  appeal,  from  Canada,  New
   Zealand, and Australia, is summarised below.


Canada

144. Cheung v Canada (Minister of Employment  and  Immigration)  (A-785-91:1
   April 1993) [1993] 2  FC  314  held  that  although  the  Chinese  family
   planning scheme was a law of general application and had  no  persecutory
   intent,  a  risk  of  forcible  sterilisation  amounted  to   persecutory
   application of that law since it was a  fundamental  violation  of  basic
   human rights.  In  contrast,  the  Court  considered  that  the  economic
   penalties  authorised  by  China's  one-child   policy   'may   well   be
   acceptable'.

145. Zheng v. Canada (Citizenship and  Immigration)  [2009]  FC  327  was  a
   judicial review application where the appellant had been pregnant, had  a
   forced abortion, and been compelled to accept an IUD against her  wishes.
   The Court considered that a statutory regime requiring the  insertion  of
   an  IUD  was  capable  of  constituting  persecution,  depending  on  its
   implementation:

      "[13]        The Board's finding that the requirement to use an IUD is
      not persecutory because it arises from a law  of  general  application
      for women of child bearing age, represents an  over-simplification  of
      the applicable legal principles and is an error of law. The  issue  of
      persecution arising from state interference with a  woman's  right  to
      reproductive choice cannot be reduced to  the  simple  determinant  of
      whether  that  interference  is  supported  by  a   law   of   general
      application. That the state is able to legislate in the area of family
      planning and population control is not the issue. It is the  means  by
      which the state's objectives are  achieved  that  must  be  critically
      examined. The more coercive or physically intrusive the  approach  the
      more likely it is  that  the  state's  conduct  will  be  seen  to  be
      persecutory. "
            (Emphasis added)


Australia

146. In 0801099 [2008] RRTA 208, a decision of the Refugee  Review  Tribunal
   (RRT) dealing with the risk to single mothers on return to China, it held
   that 'women who have a child out of  wedlock'  constituted  a  particular
   social group, and that the risk was of  a  significant  fine.    The  RRT
   considered the effect of such a fine on single mothers to be persecutory,
   particularly as the fine for unmarried mothers was higher than  that  for
   married couples with unauthorised children:


      "126. China's family planning  laws  and  Regulations  have  as  their
      ultimate  objective  the  Regulation  of  population  growth  in  that
      country. In itself, population control in China might be considered  a
      legitimate object, the enforcement of which is designed to protect the
      general welfare of the Chinese state.  However,  the  family  planning
      laws and Regulations target not only those who  exceed  the  permitted
      quota. They also specifically target women  who  have  only  a  single
      child out of wedlock. Further, as  is  the  case  in  Guangdong,  they
      impose penalties on such mothers that exceed those of a married couple
      who have one child in excess of the  permitted  number.  The  Tribunal
      finds that the aspects of China's family planning laws punishing women
      who have a single child out of wedlock are not appropriate and adapted
      to  achieving  the  legitimate  object  of  population   control.   In
      circumstances where  they  apply  more  severe  penalties  than  those
      applying to married couples who have two children, the  Tribunal  does
      not consider that they satisfy the requirement of proportionality.  In
      making these findings, the Tribunal also  notes  the  observations  of
      Merkel J in VTAO v MIMIA [2004] FCA 927, where he stated (at [41]), "A
      law  of  general  application  mandating  the  imposition  of   severe
      penalties on the mother irrespective of her personal circumstances may
      be regarded as a measure that, according to  the  standards  of  civil
      societies, is not appropriately  adapted  to  achieving  a  legitimate
      object."

147. However, in 0903266 [2009] RRTA 850, the RRT held  that  Australia  did
   not have international protection obligations to a male Chinese applicant
   from Guangdong province who had been ordered to pay SUC contributions for
   his second and third children, and had paid them by raising a loan  which
   he repaid over three years, and borrowing from friends and  family,  whom
   he repaid over a five year period.  The  RRT  found,  on  the  background
   evidence before it, that family planning  enforcement  in  Guangdong  had
   been very lax in the early 1990s but had  become  more  regulated  later.
   The family had been warned after the second child  that  there  would  be
   heavy fines if they had a third  child.   The  RRT  considered  that  the
   appellant had exaggerated the fine, which was likely to have been of  the
   order of RMB  5000-10000  (�500-�1000),  not  RMB  50000  (�5000)  as  he
   claimed, in order to claim that it  would  have  caused  him  significant
   financial difficulties.  Land confiscation occurring at the same time was
   a result of a separate programme and the appellant had  been  compensated
   for the loss of his land in due course:  it had nothing to  do  with  the
   children.

148. In 0906142 [2009] RRTA  955,  which  concerned  a  couple  from  Fujian
   Province and  their  baby,  the  RRT  found  that  unauthorised  children
   constituted a particular social group.  The RRT  dismissed  the  parents'
   appeals but held that deprivation of education and  health  services  for
   unauthorised children amounted to persecution because, it considered that
   such births could not be registered, the parents would  not  be  able  to
   obtain work, and the cost of private education and  health  services  was
   prohibitive.

149. A decision of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia  (FMC),  SZJTQ
   and others v Minister for  Immigration  and  another  [2008]  FMCA  1188,
   concerned another applicant from Fujian province.  The  FMC  quashed  the
   decision of the RRT and remitted it for  reconsideration.  No  particular
   social group had been posited by the male applicant but the  FMC  defined
   the group in question as 'parents of a child born in  breach  of  China's
   one child policy'.  The FMC considered that the RRT had erred in  law  in
   finding that the consequences which  might  or  had  followed  from  that
   breach, if in accordance with the laws of  Fujian  province,  which  were
   laws of general application, were therefore lawful.   It  criticised  the
   RRT for having insufficient regard to country materials other than the US
   State Department Report for China:


      "46. ...The country information available to the Tribunal stated  that
      such measures could not be taken without court approval, but that that
      requirement was not always followed.  The  fact  that  such  incidents
      occur  does  not  mean  that  the  actions  of  the   authorities   in
      confiscating  the  land  and  detaining  individuals  were  taken   in
      accordance with the relevant laws.  Neither  does  it  mean  that  the
      action is taken in a non discriminatory fashion."

150. In effect, the FMC considered that the question  whether  the  measures
   to be taken were persecutory was a question of fact,  and  that  the  RRT
   should have made a finding as to whether the implementation  of  the  law
   would be carried out in a  lawful  and  non-discriminatory  manner.   The
   decision is also authority for  the  point  that,  subject  to  statutory
   exclusions, the RRT must take into account the most recent information on
   country conditions.   The SZJTQ judgment was followed in SZNCK v Minister
   for Immigration and  Citizenship  [2009]  FMCA  399,  which  quashed  and
   remitted a decision of the RRT for the same reason.   The  FMC  in  SZNCK
   held that the RRT was  not  entitled  to  assume  that  action  taken  in
   consequence of non payment of a fine imposed according to law was  itself
   taken in accordance with law and was  not  discriminatory,  nor,  without
   evidence, that such action  would  be  appropriate  and  adapted  to  the
   circumstances in accordance with international standards.

151. In SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship  [2009]  FCA  315,
   the FCA held that the RRT's failure to identify a particular social group
   was not a fatal error of law, since the particular  social  group  'those
   women who became pregnant in contravention  of  China's  family  planning
   scheme and who have been required  to  have  that  pregnancy  terminated'
   could be deduced. However, it had been an error of law  for  the  RRT  to
   find that forced sterilisation could be considered  a  non-discriminatory
   penalty for contravention of a law of general application.  The FCA noted
   that after reviewing the recent country evidence, the RRT  had  concluded
   that Chinese government policy forbade  forced  sterilisations,  although
   they occurred from time to time. They tended to result from  the  actions
   of overzealous officials and they were becoming rarer.

152. The international authorities define  the  relevant  particular  social
   group in a number of ways.  The existence of a particular social group is
   not in issue in this appeal.  The relevant principles which  emerge  from
   the international authorities and case law may be summarised thus:

         a) Claimants sometimes overstated the level  of  SUC  contributions
            which might be imposed, in order to prove destitution and engage
            the Refugee Convention.

         b) Lawful implementation of a law of general application  will  not
            in general be persecutory, unless  the  penalties  imposed  were
            likely to cause destitution, or physical force would be used  to
            achieve the forcible insertion  of  an  IUD,  sterilisation,  or
            abortion of an unauthorised child; and

         c) Whether unlawful force will be used is a question of fact to  be
            determined in the context  of  the  country  materials  and  the
            evidence in the particular case.

Discussion

153. We reminded ourselves of the issues defined at the  beginning  of  this
   determination:

      (a)   Penalties for breaching the Chinese family planning  scheme  and
      policies;
      (b)   Risk factors in particular provinces;
      (c)   Internal relocation;  and
      (e)   Article 8 ECHR aspects of return to China  and/or  removal  from
           the United Kingdom.

154. The respondent accepted that women who had given  birth  in  breach  of
   the Chinese family planning scheme are members  of  a  particular  social
   group. When dealing with Article 8  we  must  have  regard  to  the  best
   interests of the children under s.55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
   Immigration  Act  2009;  that  is  a  fact-specific  analysis  for   each
   individual appellant.

155. The national legal structure underpinning the  family  planning  scheme
   in China comprises laws of general application, whose provisions  do  not
   render  lawful  forcible  sterilisation  or  termination  of   pregnancy:
   rather, Chinese citizens are expected to take  responsibility  for  their
   fertility, in the manner set out in the PFPL, the  PFP  Regulations,  and
   local regulations.  The scheme is run by local family planning officials,
   and is based on the woman's hukou area,  wherever  she  may  actually  be
   within China.

156. The risk of harm on return,  where  it  exists,  arises  from  unlawful
   actions by local family planning  officials,  derived  from  pressure  on
   officials to maintain particular birth levels in their province or  local
   area.  There is a tension between these national requirements to regulate
   births, and the substantial income generated locally from the  collection
   of birth permit and birth registration fees, and the  imposition  of  SUC
   for unauthorised births.

157. The evidence before us does not indicate that the AIT in HC & RC  erred
   in its analysis of the current position in relation to the hukou.  On the
   contrary, it confirms that very large numbers of  migrant  women  workers
   are living in cities and sending pregnancy tests back to  their  original
   hukou areas; that many children are being born in cities, although  their
   parent has a rural hukou, or an urban hukou from another part  of  China,
   and that most of China's educational provision is not state-run  but  run
   on a commercial, fee-paid basis.

158. The potential consequences for a family  or  parent  with  unauthorised
   children or a couple who have failed to arrange for one  of  them  to  be
   sterilised after a second child fall into two groups:

    (a) social and financial penalties, such as the withdrawal of  the  SCP
    Certificate, the imposition of SUC and other employment  and  promotion
    consequences;
    (b)  physical  risks,  forced  abortion  for  women  and/or  of  forced
    sterilisation of either men or women.

159. The withdrawal of the SCP certificate affects the whole family,  moving
   them from a free educational, medical and housing regime, into one  where
   they must make private fee paid provision in all  those  areas.  We  have
   also considered the practicalities  of  enforcement  where  a  parent  in
   breach cannot pay the SUC; including, sometimes, property destruction and
   compulsory education amounting in effect to detention,  for  parents  and
   grandparents of those in breach.  We are aware of  some  reports  in  May
   2001 of 20 girl babies in Hunan province being taken from  their  parents
   and put up for international adoption (see para 7 and para 3.10.6 of  the
   quote at para 13 of Appendix D).   The  evidence  is  that  this  was  an
   exceptional, one-off, event.

The experts

160. We considered the weight to  place  on  the  evidence  of  the  country
   experts.   We have  already  stated  that  we  are  unable  to  give  any
   independent weight to the evidence of Professor Aguilar, save where it is
   corroborated by other materials or evidence.   It may well be that had we
   heard oral evidence from him, as we did from Dr Sheehan and Professor Fu,
   that our concerns may have been answered.  Professor Aguilar is not to be
   criticised for that:  he was ready to appear, but the  linked  appeal  in
   which he was instructed did not proceed.

161.  We turn next to the weight which Dr Sheehan's evidence will bear.   Dr
   Sheehan's is not legally qualified: her strength  as  an  expert  witness
   lies in her regular visits to China and her knowledge of publications and
   press reports obtained during those visits.   She was unable to assist us
   in relation to the legal enforcement r�gime for SUC.

162. We are indebted to Dr Sheehan for a  vivid  description  of  the  local
   poster campaigns and the way in which information about  family  planning
   is communicated in  rural  areas.     Dr  Sheehan's  expertise  was  very
   helpful in relation to the levels of payment required by  snakeheads  and
   the modern hukou system.  Dr Sheehan did not consider that the amount  of
   the claimed snakehead payment by this appellant was realistic,  where  no
   trafficking claim was made:  although rates had been declining, it seemed
   very low.

163. Dr Sheehan had seen for  herself  the  posters  and  lists  in  village
   schools defining who was entitled to apply for a birth permit, and  when.
   She did not consider it likely that the appellant would have been unaware
   of the  family  planning  scheme  as  alleged.   She  had  refreshed  her
   knowledge of the changes in the hukou system, and noted that it did  seem
   to have been ameliorated in a  number  of  respects,  in  particular  the
   ability to move from rural to urban hukou without permission, needing  to
   make only one application for a change of residence.   We have found  her
   evidence about the TRP particularly enlightening.

164. However, her evidence did present difficulties: her early reports  were
   directed to a fact set which no longer existed, since the appellant  when
   we heard the appeal was not a single trafficked woman with one child, but
   a married woman with two children born in the  United  Kingdom,  who  has
   never claimed to have been trafficked.   Her  latest  report  treats  the
   appellant as the mother of four children.  We have found, for reasons  we
   set out below, that the children in China do not exist and  that  she  is
   the mother of only two children.  We were  concerned  that  Dr  Sheehan's
   report appeared to exaggerate the risks to the appellant.  In particular,
   her written report stated that the appellant was 'likely' to face  forced
   sterilisation, a position she did not maintain in her oral evidence.

165.  We  have  considered  Dr  Sheehan's  December  2011  with   particular
   interest, since (apart from the number of children involved), it  engaged
   with the existing factual matrix Although the material in this report  is
   helpful,  we  consider  that  Dr  Sheehan's  approach  lacks   sufficient
   objectivity, in particular since she continued to refer to the SUC  as  a
   'fine' and to the criminal enforcement  procedures.   We  were  concerned
   that the evidence relied upon often dated back to  the  pre-2005  r�gime.
   Dr Sheehan's report did not assist us by indicating what SUC  was  likely
   to be imposed if the appellant were  the  female  member  of  a  'double-
   single' couple, who had never been married before coming  to  the  United
   Kingdom, but had married her husband after the birth of  their  children.
   Since that is the factual matrix as we found it, we received only limited
   assistance from Dr Sheehan on the SUC amounts which would be imposed.  We
   do not consider that it is appropriate, as Dr Sheehan has, to  judge  the
   appellant's ability to pay SUC only on the  basis  of  a  putative  rural
   income which she might earn, or to discount  the  destitution  protection
   legislation described by Professor Fu.

166.  We  accepted  the  evidence  of  Professor  Fu  and  of  the   Chinese
   Regulations themselves that the family planning scheme is civil law,  not
   criminal.  Professor Fu was able to assist the Tribunal in  understanding
   the operation of the scheme and the relevant elements of the legal system
   in China.  The evidence of Professor Fu  had  limitations  also:   as  he
   acknowledged,  he  had  not  been  asked  to  look  outside  the  Chinese
   materials.  The six reported cases produced from the  Beijing  University
   database were of interest, but since they were a sample drawn  from  over
   fifty cases held on that database, it is difficult  to  evaluate  whether
   they are representative of the overall position.  As regards his  updated
   report dealing with the appellant's November 2010 documents, we  did  not
   find that document as helpful as we hoped, despite the long delay in  its
   preparation.

Country guidance findings

167.      Based on the  evidence  before  us,  we  are  satisfied  that  the
   Chinese government has largely  moved  away  from  the  excesses  of  the
   unregulated family planning policy which  existed  before  the  statutory
   scheme came into force in 2005.  There is no doubt that appalling  abuses
   took place during the 'punishment' approach, but China has been moving to
   increased  statutory  protection  and  Regulation,  after  a  period   of
   consideration during which there was increased laxity.

168. The statutory scheme is now revisited every five years,  most  recently
   in 2010.  The present scheme will be reviewed  again  in  2015.   In  the
   period leading up to the 2005  and  2010  reviews,  there  was  increased
   laxity in local areas, followed by a national campaign to return  to  the
   authorised quotas, which placed pressure on  local  officials.   In  each
   case, in a small number of provinces and areas, that  resulted  in  human
   rights  abuses,   including   large-scale   forced   sterilisations   and
   termination of unauthorised pregnancies, even very close to term.

169.     The family planning policy is well-known.  The  policy  is  China's
   flagship policy and huge resources are placed behind enforcing it.  It is
   openly discussed among women and a lack of literacy would not mean that a
   rural woman would be unaware of  her  responsibilities.   It  has  social
   support too now;  larger families are not considered to be a good  thing,
   as they were in the past.  In rural areas, family planning officials post
   lists of married women entitled to apply for a birth  permit,  indicating
   precisely when such an application may be made. There are family planning
   posters, some threatening and some encouraging.

170. Millions of Chinese internal migrants work away  from  home  in  cities
   where they do not hold a hukou.  They are required to stay in touch  with
   their hukou area and, if female, either return for tri-monthly  pregnancy
   tests or else send back test results.  Some provinces collect a  deposit,
   refundable  against  the  SUC  where  a  pregnancy  is  required  to   be
   terminated. Mothers pregnant with unauthorised children  in  rural  areas
   were described as moving around and  keeping  out  of  sight  during  the
   pregnancy ('pregnant guerrillas').

171.       Double-single couples are entitled to two  children,  subject  in
   some provinces to four-year birth  spacing,  and  there  are  many  other
   options for second  or  additional  children,  according  to  the  family
   planning Regulations in each province.  Different regulations apply where
   one is an only child and the other is not, or  where  both  spouses  have
   siblings. The only generalisation that can be made in  all  circumstances
   is that the number of children permitted will depend  on  the  provincial
   Regulations and the individual circumstances of the couple.

172. Considerable social pressure  is  applied  to  women  and  to  families
   during  unauthorised  pregnancies.  Any  second  child,  even  authorised
   (including first pregnancies ending in a multiple birth, whether  natural
   or IVF-induced), will entail the loss of the  family's  SCP  Certificate,
   and affects the whole family, including children. The  family  loses  its
   privileged access to schools, housing, pensions,  and  free  medical  and
   contraceptive treatment.   SUC will be payable, albeit  at  a  reasonable
   rate, where the additional child is authorised or results from a multiple
   birth.  If the child is unauthorised,  there  are  additional  penalties.
   Those working for emanations of the state will be dismissed;  in  private
   businesses, they may be demoted or  dismissed  and  their  line  managers
   penalised.

173.       Hundreds of thousands of unauthorised  children  are  born  every
   year.  Family planning officials are required to register them, once  the
   SUC has been paid: they have no incentive to refuse  registration,  since
   registration fees are a significant source of  income  for  local  family
   planning authorities, as are birth permits and SUC.    There is a tension
   between that profitability, and the quota of births for the town,  county
   and province, which is subject to regular national reporting and pressure
   on local officials to bring their province, district, or area back within
   the  quota,  or  face  workplace  discipline  and   career   consequences
   themselves. Education and medical treatment are  available,  but  are  no
   longer free. We remind  ourselves  that  the  vast  majority  of  nursery
   schools in Shanghai are in private hands, and are fee paying.

174. From time to time, most recently in early 2010, national  campaigns  to
   reduce over-quota births lead  to  vigorous  (sometimes  unlawful)  local
   'crackdowns' on unauthorised pregnancies and couples who have  not  opted
   for sterilisation after the second  child.   The  pressure  on  officials
   sometimes results in large  scale  unlawful  family  planning  abuses  in
   provinces or areas which  are  significantly  over  quota.   During  such
   crackdowns, human rights abuses can and do occur in  some  provinces  and
   areas.  We do not consider that these large-scale abuses are likely to be
   under-reported:  on the contrary, they attract  widespread  international
   attention and opprobrium and may even result in international  diplomatic
   intervention.   However, these occurrences, appalling as  they  are,  are
   exceptional.

175. Where officials break the law  in  the  enforcement  of  the  statutory
   scheme, judicial review, criticism of  the  officials,  and  damages  for
   breach are available.  In  the  cases  we  were  shown,  that  right  was
   exercised by husbands with some standing in the community:  there  is  no
   legal aid and no indication that there exists any  real  remedy  for  the
   woman concerned, especially where the  termination  or  sterilisation  of
   which she complains causes her long-term physical harm or even death.

176. The requirement to pay for education, contraceptive  and  medical  care
   does not, without more, amount to persecution, but if there  are  factors
   individual to the family (such as, for  example,  the  inability  of  the
   parents to support themselves because of an injury  or  ill  health),  we
   accept that it is capable of doing so.

177. Although both spouses are responsible for  fertility  control,  on  the
   evidence before us, it is the family planning regulations attached to the
   wife's hukou, having regard to the personal characteristics of the couple
   and any children they already have (their ethnicity, whether they have  a
   disabled child, their status as children of  heroes  or  miners,  and  so
   forth) which regulates the number of children to  which  that  couple  is
   entitled, as well as the  SUC,  social  and  employment  consequences  of
   breach for both of them.

178. The evidence before us indicates  that  Chinese  women  in  general  do
   control their fertility, broadly in accordance with the  family  planning
   scheme.  They send back regular tri-monthly  pregnancy  tests  even  when
   working away from their hukou area,  and  either  conform  to  the  birth
   authorisation scheme, or, if young or in difficult circumstances, may opt
   for termination, which is readily available.  Where  an  unauthorised  or
   inappropriate pregnancy occurs, Chinese women are expected  to  terminate
   that pregnancy, and to do so is socially unremarkable. In general, we  do
   not consider that the risk to a  mother  who  has  herself  opted  for  a
   termination engages international protection.

Risk on return

Forcible termination of pregnancy

179. The country materials contain a number of reports  of  forced  abortion
   in some provinces and  areas,  particularly  at  times  where  additional
   pressure is exerted on local birth control  officials.   Particularly  at
   such times, a woman who does not opt  for  voluntary  termination  of  an
   unauthorised pregnancy may well face a risk of forced abortion, sometimes
   very late in the pregnancy, which is plainly persecutory in nature.

180. If the woman remains in her hukou area and  becomes  pregnant  with  an
   unauthorised child, she may be  able  to  escape  detection  by  being  a
   'pregnant guerilla' in the evocative Chinese phrase, that is to  say,  by
   keeping out of sight during  the  pregnancy  and  moving  around  between
   relatives.  The evidence indicates that many  rural  Chinese  women  have
   large families, despite the restrictions.   However,  if  a  national  or
   local birth limitation campaign (a 'crackdown') occurs,  the  risk  rises
   sharply, both for unlawful forced termination of pregnancy, right  up  to
   the date of delivery, and for unlawful forcible sterilisation or forcible
   insertion of an IUD.

181. During those times, if the woman is in her hukou area, and if there  is
   a crackdown in the area which  is  accompanied  by  unlawful  enforcement
   methods, we are satisfied that the  risk  may  well  rise  to  the  level
   required to engage international protection under the Refugee Convention,
   or humanitarian protection or human rights protection, that  is  to  say,
   that there will be a real risk or a reasonable degree of likelihood  that
   a woman with unauthorised children, or  an  unauthorised  pregnancy,  may
   well suffer an unlawful  termination  or  sterilisation  procedure.   The
   level of risk of unlawful action by family planning officials will  be  a
   question of fact in each case, dependent on circumstances in the mother's
   hukou area and whether there is a birth limitation campaign in  progress.



182. We have considered whether such risk, where it exists, may  be  avoided
   by internal relocation.  Internal  migrant  women  must  send  back  tri-
   monthly pregnancy tests, but we also note that a number of provinces have
   returned to requiring physical testing because they  are  concerned  that
   many of the tests they receive are falsified.   There  are  over  200,000
   unauthorised births in China,  many  of  them  in  cities.   The  country
   evidence does not indicate effective pursuit of internal migrant women by
   birth control officials from their hukou area.

183. The  persecutory  treatment  (forcible  termination  or  sterilisation)
   which the returnee fears is unlawful.   The motivation for birth  control
   officials to deal with individuals for breaches of  the  family  planning
   scheme arises out of considerations which affect them personally  (either
   in terms of their remuneration or employment prospects or both)  and  the
   country evidence does not indicate co-ordination of such unlawful actions
   between birth control officials in different  areas.   We  consider  that
   internal  relocation  will  prevent  any  adverse   consequences   during
   pregnancy in almost all cases.

Forcible sterilisation

184. Voluntary sterilisation of one spouse after the  second  birth  is  the
   norm and is generally socially accepted. Although either partner  can  be
   the one sterilised, in the great majority of cases, it will be the  woman
   who is sterilised.  A much smaller percentage of Chinese men undergo  the
   procedure. Some provinces reward compliance with either a  small  regular
   payment or a one-off payment to the family.  Again, we do  not  consider,
   where a couple opts for voluntary sterilisation, that either of them will
   require international protection.  Nor  do  we  consider  that  voluntary
   sterilisation in pursuance of a law of general application is a procedure
   which is inherently persecutory.

185. Where there exists a real risk  of  forcible  sterilisation  of  either
   partner, that would be persecutory and international protection would  be
   engaged. On the extensive evidence before us, we are not  satisfied  that
   in general there is a real  risk  of  forcible  sterilisation  of  either
   partner, although we recognise that there have been three modern scandals
   during birth regulation crackdowns, where such sterilisations occurred in
   large numbers.  We recognise also that some of the international  reports
   state that forcible sterilisation occurs  'fairly  frequently';  however,
   the overwhelming evidence, and the evidence of  Professor  Fu  (which  we
   accept and prefer on this point) is that the occurrence  is  limited  and
   therefore, in our judgment, it does not amount to a real risk.

Foreign-born children

186. In general, the evidence before us indicates that the  consequences  of
   an unauthorised birth once it has occurred  (whether  within  or  outside
   China) are social and financial. We remind ourselves that breach  of  the
   family planning policy is not a criminal offence but a civil matter,  and
   that after a down payment of 50%, the balance of any SUC imposed  may  be
   paid over at least  three  years.   We  accept  Professor  Fu's  evidence
   regarding the existence of statutory protection against  destitution  for
   those who cannot pay. We note  that  many  couples  regard  giving  birth
   abroad as evidence of wealth and status, and that significant numbers  of
   parents travel to Hong Kong and Macao, in particular, for that purpose.

187. The attitude taken by provincial birth control authorities  to  parents
   returning with foreign-born children  remains  unclear;  some  provincial
   officials indicated  that  the  additional  child  would  be  treated  as
   unauthorised and registered only on payment of SUC; others, that foreign-
   born children do not breach the  family  planning  scheme  because  their
   birth did not breach the PFP Regulations in any particular province.

188. Parents returning with foreign-born children are  expected  to  produce
   birth certificates for that birth and to pay the SUC.   In  general,  the
   rate of SUC, even if it is imposed, is not likely to be beyond the  means
   of a couple who have lived abroad for some years.  There is  very  little
   evidence of parents being disproportionately penalised when  they  return
   to China with foreign-born children.

189. We find that in general, couples with foreign-born children,  over  and
   above the permitted number for that couple (which is variable,  depending
   whether they are a double-single couple, children of  heroes  or  miners,
   members of ethnic minorities and so forth) will on return to China not be
   at real risk of  persecution,  serious  harm  or  human  rights  breaches
   engaging international protection.

190. It was not suggested by either representative  that  the  international
   protection  Conventions  would  be  engaged  either  by  an   appellant's
   intention to become pregnant unlawfully after return  to  China,  or  her
   intention to abstain from such pregnancy. That was not  the  evidence  in
   this appeal and we do not purport to give guidance on the point.

Country guidance summary

191. On the basis of all the evidence we saw and heard in  this  appeal,  we
   summarise our country guidance as follows:

   Chinese family planning scheme:


    (1)    In China, all state obligations and benefits depend on the  area
    where a person holds their 'hukou',  the  name  given  to  the  Chinese
    household registration system. There are different provisions for those
    holding an 'urban hukou' or a  'rural  hukou':  in  particular,  partly
    because of the difficulties experienced  historically  by  peasants  in
    China, the family planning scheme is more  relaxed  for  those  with  a
    'rural hukou'.

    (2)    It is unhelpful (and a mistranslation of the  Chinese  term)  to
    describe the Chinese family planning scheme as  a  'one-child  policy',
    given the current vast range of exceptions  to  the  'one  couple,  one
    child'  principle.  Special  provision  is  made  for   'double-single'
    couples, where both are only  children  supporting  their  parents  and
    their grandparents. The number of children  authorised  for  a  married
    couple, ('authorised children') depends on the  provincial  regulations
    and the individual circumstances of the couple. Additional children are
    referred as 'unauthorised children'.

    (3)    The Chinese family planning scheme expects childbirth  to  occur
    within marriage.   It  encourages  'late'  marriage  and  'late'  first
    births.   'Late' marriages are defined as age 25 (male) and 23 (female)
    and 'late' first births from age 24.  A birth  permit  is  not  usually
    required for the first birth, but must be  obtained  before  trying  to
    become pregnant with any further children. The Chinese family  planning
    scheme also originally included  a  requirement  for  four-year  'birth
    spacing'. With  the  passage  of  time,  province  after  province  has
    abandoned that requirement. Incorrect  birth  spacing,  where  this  is
    still a requirement, results in a financial penalty.

    (4)    Breach of the Chinese family planning scheme is a civil  matter,
    not a criminal matter.

    Single-child families

    (5)    Parents who restrict themselves  to  one  child  qualify  for  a
    "Certificate of Honour for  Single-Child  Parents"  (SCP  certificate),
    which entitles them to a range of enhanced  benefits  throughout  their
    lives,  from  priority  schooling,  free  medical   treatment,   longer
    maternity, paternity and honeymoon leave, priority  access  to  housing
    and to retirement homes, and enhanced pension provision.

    Multiple-child families

    (6)    Any second child, even if authorised, entails the  loss  of  the
    family's SCP certificate. Loss of a family's SCP  results  in  loss  of
    privileged access to schools, housing, pensions and  free  medical  and
    contraceptive  treatment.  Education  and  medical   treatment   remain
    available but are no longer free.

    (7)    Where an unauthorised child is born, the family  will  encounter
    additional penalties. Workplace discipline for parents in employment is
    likely to include demotion or even loss of employment. In  addition,  a
    'social upbringing charge' is payable (SUC), which is based on  income,
    with a down payment of 50% and three years to pay the balance.

    (8)    There are hundreds of thousands of  unauthorised  children  born
    every year.  Family planning officials are not entitled  to  refuse  to
    register unauthorised children and there is no real risk of  a  refusal
    to register a child. Payment for birth permits, for the registration of
    children, and the imposition of SUC charges for unauthorised births are
    a significant source of revenue for local family planning  authorities.
    There is a tension between that profitability, and enforcement  of  the
    nationally imposed quota of births for the town, county  and  province,
    exceeding which can harm officials' careers.

    (9)    The financial consequences for a family of losing its  SCP  (for
    having more than one child) and/or of having SUC  imposed  (for  having
    unauthorised children)  and/or  suffering  disadvantages  in  terms  of
    access to education, medical treatment, loss of  employment,  detriment
    to future employment etc will  not,  in  general,  reach  the  severity
    threshold to amount to persecution or  serious  harm  or  treatment  in
    breach of Article 3.

    (10) There are regular national campaigns to bring down the birth rates
    in provinces and local areas which have exceeded the  permitted  quota.
    Over-quota birth rates threaten the employment and  future  careers  of
    birth control officials in those regions, and where there is a national
    campaign, can result  in  large  scale  unlawful  crackdowns  by  local
    officials in a small number of provinces  and  areas.  In  such  areas,
    during such large scale crackdowns, human  rights  abuses  can  and  do
    occur, resulting in women, and sometimes men, being forcibly sterilised
    and pregnant women having their pregnancies  forcibly  terminated.  The
    last such crackdown took place in spring 2010.

    Risk factors

    (11)   In general, for female returnees,  there  is  no  real  risk  of
    forcible sterilisation or forcible termination in China. However, if  a
    female returnee who has already had her permitted quota of children  is
    being returned at a time when there is  a  crackdown  in  her   'hukou'
    area, accompanied by unlawful practices  such  as  forced  abortion  or
    sterilisation, such a returnee would  be  at  real   risk  of  forcible
    sterilisation  or,  if  she  is  pregnant  at  the  time,  of  forcible
    termination of an unauthorised pregnancy.  Outside of these times, such
    a female returnee  may  also  be  able  to  show  an  individual  risk,
    notwithstanding the absence of a general risk, where there is  credible
    evidence that she, or members of her family remaining  in  China,  have
    been threatened with, or have suffered, serious  adverse  ill-treatment
    by reason of her breach of the family planning scheme.

    (12)    Where  a  female  returnee  is  at  real   risk   of   forcible
    sterilisation or termination of pregnancy in  her  'hukou'  area,  such
    risk is of persecution, serious harm and Article 3  ill-treatment.  The
    respondent accepted that such risk would be  by  reason  of  a  Refugee
    Convention reason,  membership of a particular social group, 'women who
    gave birth in breach of China's family planning scheme'.

    (13)   Male returnees do not, in general, face a real risk of  forcible
    sterilisation, whether in their 'hukou' area or  elsewhere,  given  the
    very low rate of sterilisation of males overall,  and  the  even  lower
    rate of forcible sterilisation.

    Internal relocation

    (14) Where a real risk exists in the 'hukou' area, it may  be  possible
    to avoid the risk by moving to a city.  Millions  of  Chinese  internal
    migrants, male and female, live and work in cities where  they  do  not
    hold an 'urban hukou'.  Internal migrant women are required to stay in
    touch with  their  'hukou'  area  and  either  return  for  tri-monthly
    pregnancy tests or else send back test results.  The  country  evidence
    does not indicate a real risk of effective pursuit of internal  migrant
    women leading to forcible family  planning  actions,  sterilisation  or
    termination,     taking      place      in      their      city      of
    migration. Therefore, internal relocation will, in almost all  cases,
    avert the risk in the hukou area.  However, internal relocation may not
    be safe where there is credible evidence of individual pursuit  of  the
    returnee or her family, outside the 'hukou' area. Whether it is  unduly
    harsh to expect an individual returnee and her family  to  relocate  in
    this way will be a question of fact in each case.




Appellant's case

192. The appellant is a Chinese woman of  the  majority  Han  ethnic  group,
   married to a Chinese national Han man whom she met in the United Kingdom.
    Her home province is Hunan; his is Anhui.  She is poorly educated.   She
   came from a rural area outside Jing Jie town.  In  China,  she  says  she
   worked in a knitwear  factory  and  was  aware  that  women  usually  had
   sterilisations after their second child. The appellant  and  her  husband
   have two children, born in the United Kingdom, a daughter first,  then  a
   son.  They are a double-single couple, both only children:  they did  not
   marry until after the birth of their children.

Letter of refusal

193. The respondent  rejected  the  appellant's  claim  by  letter  dated  7
   October 2005, noting that the policy limiting the  number  of  births  in
   China applied to the whole population  of  China  and  was  a  legitimate
   effort  on  the  part  of  the  Chinese  government  to  contain  China's
   population growth; that the Chinese government opposed the use  of  force
   or coercion and that legal remedies had been  available  since  the  1989
   Administrative Procedural Law; that the policy was more  relaxed  in  the
   rural areas, allowing second  children  in  certain  circumstances;  that
   there was further relaxation for ethnic minorities; that local  officials
   frequently  made  false  reports  in  response  to  pressure  from  their
   superiors and from individuals; that China's NPFPC estimated fertility at
   1.8 births  per  woman  as  at  the  2000  census;  and  that  since  the
   appellant's home province (Hunan) was a moderate province, it was  highly
   unlikely that the appellant would  be  at  risk  there  on  return.   The
   appellant had an internal relocation option to another (unspecified) part
   of China and the Refugee Convention was inapplicable.   The  humanitarian
   protection and human rights claims were also rejected.

Immigration Judge's determination

194. On 16 January 2006, the Immigration  Judge  dismissed  the  appellant's
   appeal on all grounds. The appellant then presented as a single unmarried
   mother with one child, a  daughter  born  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
   Immigration Judge asked a great many questions of detail,  despite  there
   being a respondent's representative present.  He  dismissed  the  appeal,
   because he considered that the entire account  was  a  fabrication.   The
   Immigration Judge considered that the appellant would probably be able to
   register her child on return, and dismissed the appeal on all grounds.

Error of law

195. The appellant made an application  for  reconsideration,  arguing  that
   the level of questioning by the Immigration Judge during the hearing  was
   such as to offend against the guidance given by the IAT  in  the  starred
   determination MNM (Surendran guidelines for  Adjudicators)  Kenya  [2000]
   UKIAT 00005*. Reconsideration was ordered, and on 20 February  2007,  SIJ
   Southern (as he then  was)  found  that  the  determination  contained  a
   material  error  of  law  and   set   aside   the   Immigration   Judge's
   determination, for reconsideration afresh  (now  remaking  by  the  Upper
   Tribunal).  His decision is appended to this determination at Appendix B.

196. The appeal came before us, for remaking afresh,  with  the  credibility
   of the appellant's history in China clearly in issue.   There  were  some
   factual changes when we heard the appeal: the  appellant  and  her  (now)
   husband had two children.  They had a second United Kingdom-born child in
   2007, this time a son.   On  24  March  2009,  the  couple  married.  The
   marriage, and the birth of the daughter and son, were evidenced by United
   Kingdom marriage and  birth  certificates  and  are  not  disputed.   The
   appellant and her husband are both only children and are a  double-single
   couple, but their children were born before their civil marriage.

197. The appellant gave an  account  of  another  husband  and  two  earlier
   children, born in China before she came to the United Kingdom.  That part
   of her history was disputed and for the reasons we now set out, we do not
   find it credible, to the  lower  standard  applicable  for  international
   protection, although we accept that it is  broadly  consistent  with  the
   country information.  She said she was married,  informally  in  her  in-
   laws' home, and had two  children,  the  first  child  born  publicly  in
   hospital and the second at home with the help of a private midwife.   The
   marriage failed:  the appellant  refused  sterilisation  as  she  thought
   another man would not want her  if  she  could  not  have  children.  Her
   husband left her in-laws' home, and not long after,  the  appellant  left
   her children in China and came to the United Kingdom with the help  of  a
   snakehead agent, to whom she claimed to owe a  lot  of  money.   We  were
   troubled by the close similarity in the  names  of  her  claimed  Chinese
   partner and her husband, and those of her  children,  but  absent  expert
   evidence, as we are not experts in Chinese naming  conventions,  we  have
   not placed any weight on that.

Credibility

198. The appellant's refusal of sterilisation in the context  of  a  divorce
   was consistent with the country evidence, since  there  is  provision  in
   most of the provincial Regulations for additional authorised children  to
   be permitted in a new relationship, even where  one  party  has  children
   already from a previous relationship.  Were that the only issue, we would
   have accepted the core of the appellant's account as credible.

199. However, there were other areas of the appellant's  evidence  where  we
   were not satisfied that she told us the truth on a number of matters:

           (a)   The appellant claimed that she was completely  unaware  of
           the family planning scheme until shortly before she left  China.
           That was inconsistent with her account of discussions  with  her
           co-workers about sterilisation after a  second  child.   In  our
           view,  the  appellant's  evidence  about   her   ignorance   was
           inconsistent  with  the  evidence  of  Professor  Fu  about  the
           importance of the  family  planning  policy  in  China  and  the
           publicity given to it, particularly in  rural  areas,  and  also
           with Dr Sheehan's description of a 'massive publicity  campaign'
           in rural and  urban  China  to  publicise  the  family  planning
           policy.  If the appellant's hukou area was one in which  it  was
           possible to be unaware of the policy for so long, that does  not
           assist her:  it indicates that enforcement there  was  very  lax
           indeed.

           (b)   There were significant discrepancies in her evidence as to
           how she  funded  her  departure  from  China,  and  the  overall
           circumstances of her departure. We have  taken  account  of  her
           variable references as to the distance to  'the  city'  and  the
           conflicting accounts the appellant gave about what passport  she
           had used and when.

           (c)   It is difficult to understand why someone with the  modest
           financial circumstances of this appellant would choose to become
           indebted to an agent for a sum which was much greater  than  the
           SUC penalty she would have had to pay for any second child,  had
           she remained in China. The provincial Regulations for Hunan, her
           home province, set out SUC for second children at 2-6 times  the
           Income Multiplier, or 6-8 times the Income Multiplier  if  their
           relationship is bigamous or they are not married.   The  maximum
           SUC for an unauthorised second child born in marriage  in  Hunan
           is six times the local Income Multiplier of �490 (�2940) and the
           minimum is twice the  Income  Multiplier  (�980),  with  a  down
           payment of 50% and three years to pay the  balance.   Given  the
           appellant's poor education and  limited  resources,  a  decision
           instead to pay �4000 to an agent, with a down payment of  �2000,
           and the difficulties and risks of  the  journey  to  the  United
           Kingdom, makes no sense at all.

200. Overall, and to the lower  standard  applicable  to  the  international
   protection Conventions, we reject the appellant's account of her  history
   in China.  We do not accept that she had a partner in China,  nor  do  we
   find that she had any children born in China, or left  China  unlawfully.
   We find that the appellant left China for some  other  reason  than  that
   stated, using her own, properly issued Chinese passport.

201. The marriage  and  births  in  the  United  Kingdom  are  supported  by
   appropriate evidence and we accept,  therefore,  that  if  returned,  the
   appellant would do so as a married overseas Chinese from the majority Han
   ethnic group, with two foreign-born children, both  born  in  the  United
   Kingdom, before her civil marriage to their father.  The appellant, being
   out of  the  country,  has  not  sought  permission  from  birth  control
   authorities in her home province either for her marriage or for  her  two
   children.        We  record  that  Mr  Johnson  accepted  that  in  those
   circumstances, the appellant was a member of a particular social group.

Risk on return

202. In practice, permission is not required in advance for a  first  child.
   The appellant's first child was a daughter; she and  her  husband  are  a
   double-single couple; and, absent any difficulty over birth  spacing  and
   their not marrying until after they had their children, it  appears  that
   in China they would have been entitled  to  authorisation  for  a  second
   child (see, in particular, paragraph 20 of Appendix E).  As the mother of
   two children, there  would  be  a  strong  social  expectation  that  the
   appellant or her husband undergo sterilisation, but we are not  satisfied
   on the evidence that there is a real risk to  her,  or  her  husband,  of
   forcible  sterilisation,  albeit  there  is  a  social  expectation  that
   families will arrange for one of them to be sterilised, after the  second
   child.  Nor do we consider that  the  appellant  would  be  unwilling  to
   undergo sterilisation voluntarily in China:  her  claimed  objections  in
   relation to her earlier relationship (which we find to be a  fabrication)
   were that she might need to be free to give children to  a  new  husband.
   That is not an issue on the present factual matrix.

203. The provincial Regulations for Hunan, her home province,  set  out  SUC
   for second children at 2-6 times the Income Multiplier, or 6-8 times  the
   Income Multiplier if their relationship  is  bigamous  or  they  are  not
   married.  There is no mention  of  SUC  for  a  first  child.   We  find,
   therefore, that the maximum SUC for which this  couple  would  be  liable
   would be 6-8 times the local Income Multiplier of �490 (so between  �2940
   and �3920) of which 50% would be payable on registration of the children,
   with three years to pay the balance.   Subject to payment of the relevant
   level of SUC, and provision of proper overseas birth certificates,  which
   we have seen, the children's births would be registered.

204. In assessing the claimant's ability to  pay  the  SUC  at  that  level,
   regard must be had to the fact that the appellant and  her  husband  have
   been in the United Kingdom for a number  of  years,  and  that  financial
   assistance with return is available from the  respondent.   The  SUC  50%
   down-payment would be between �1470-�1910 and we consider that on return,
   the appellant and her husband would be able to make arrangements  to  pay
   it, and in due course the balance, if SUC  were  imposed.  We  note  that
   enforcement of SUC is through the Chinese  courts  and  cannot  take  the
   family below a certain level, as set out in Professor Fu's evidence.  The
   couple would not qualify for an SCP Certificate, but many Chinese parents
   do not, and birth control,  medical  treatment,  and  education  for  the
   children are available, albeit at a price, to parents who do not have  an
   SCP Certificate.

205. For the reasons given above, we do not consider that there  is  a  real
   risk  of  this  appellant  being  subjected  to  treatment  amounting  to
   persecution or serious harm, in breach either of the Refugee  Convention,
   humanitarian protection or of Article 3 ECHR.

Article 8 ECHR: private and family life

206. We  next  considered  Article  8  ECHR.   We  bear  in  mind  that  the
   appellant's husband has been in the United  Kingdom,  albeit  unlawfully,
   for over 12 years. The appellant herself has been here since  2004,  over
   seven years. The husband's application under the legacy scheme was  under
   active consideration in March 2011 but  does  not  appear  to  have  been
   determined in his favour. It appears that the appellant  herself  made  a
   backlog application in or about September 2010.  She has  been  reporting
   regularly as required;  the family are receiving NASS support.

207. We approached Article 8 ECHR via the five questions set  in  Razgar,  R
   (on the application of) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
   [2004] UKHL 27, which we answer as follows:  there is private and  family
   life between the appellant, her children, and her husband in  the  United
   Kingdom.  To separate them would be interference with  such  private  and
   family life of sufficient gravity to engage  Article  8  ECHR.    Removal
   would be in  accordance  with  law,  and  the  control  of  migration  is
   necessary in a democratic society.  We therefore answer  the  first  four
   questions in the affirmative.  The appeal turns on  the  fifth  question,
   that of the proportionality of removal.

208. The private life evidence before us under Article 8 was not  extensive.
    Clearly the appellant and her husband have  family  life  together,  and
   have spent a number of years in the United Kingdom. Both  their  children
   were born here, but are not British citizens, and there was  no  evidence
   before us that the parties had any significant private  and  family  life
   outside their immediate family circle.

209. In considering the best interests of the children  under  s.55  of  the
   Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009,  we  were  guided  by  the
   Upper Tribunal's decisions in E-A (Article 8 - best interests  of  child)
   Nigeria [2011] UKUT 315 (IAC), MK (best interests of child) India  [2011]
   UKUT 475 (IAC) and in LD (Article 8 - best interests of  child)  Zimbabwe
   [2010] UKUT 278 (IAC).  We have considered  the  best  interests  of  the
   children as a primary consideration.

210. We bear in mind  that,  if  the  children  return  to  China  with  the
   appellant, the family will not qualify for the privileges which attach to
   a couple holding an SCP Certificate, since they will present and register
   two children on arrival. The children are now  six  and  four  years  old
   respectively.   These are very young children and we are satisfied it  is
   in their best interests to remain with their parents.

211. The guidance in E-A (Nigeria) was set out in the judicial  headnote  as
   follows:

      "(i)                 The correct starting point  in  considering  the
      welfare and best interests of a young child would be that it is in the
      best interests of a child to live with and be brought up by his or her
      parents, subject to any very strong contra-indication. Where it is  in
      the best interests of a child to live with and be brought up by his or
      her parents, then the  child's  removal  with  his  parents  does  not
      involve any separation of family life.
      (ii)               Absent other factors, the reason why a  period  of
      substantial residence as a child may become a weighty consideration in
      the balance of competing considerations is that in the course of  such
      time  roots  are  put  down,  personal   identities   are   developed,
      friendships are formed and links are made with the  community  outside
      the family unit. The degree to which these elements  of  private  life
      are forged and therefore the weight to be given to the passage of time
      will depend upon the facts in each case.
      (iii)             During a child's very early years, he or she will be
      primarily focused on self and the caring parents  or  guardian.   Long
      residence once the child is likely to have  formed  ties  outside  the
      family is likely to have greater impact on his or her well being.
      (iv)             Those who have their families  with  them  during  a
      period of study in the UK must do so in the light of  the  expectation
      of return.
      (v)               The Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4 was
      not ruling that the ability of a young child to readily adapt to  life
      in  a  new  country  was  an  irrelevant  factor,  rather   that   the
      adaptability of the child in each case must be assessed and is  not  a
      conclusive consideration on its own."

212. The appellant's son had an offer of  a  nursery  place  from  September
   2011 from Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council and presumably  took  it
   up.  He is not yet of formal school age and is young enough to  adapt  to
   life in China. Her daughter is two years older and  will  have  had  some
   schooling already, but is also of an age still to be adaptable to life in
   China. There is no evidence before us which  contradicts  the  view  that
   these children are still at the stage where they are primarily focused on
   the home environment.  Nor is there any  real  evidence  of  this  family
   having engaged with British society, outside  their  own  family  circle.
   The appellant produced her UKBA signing-on card  to  show  that  she  has
   complied with the respondent's requirements in that respect.

213. On return to China, the loss of this family's SCP will  mean  that  the
   children will not have privileged access to schools.  However,  education
   and medical treatment will  remain  available,  but  will  not  be  free,
   provided the children are registered.  There  is  no  real  risk  of  the
   children not being registered.

214.   In  considering  the  proportionality  of  removal,  we  have  placed
   considerable weight on the state's interest in immigration  control,  but
   we have also had regard  to  the  accepted  delay  on  the  part  of  the
   respondent in dealing with their legacy applications. Having balanced all
   the relevant factors, and giving such weight as we  consider  appropriate
   to each of the individual factors and the best interests of the  children
   as a primary consideration, we find, that if  the  appellant  is  removed
   with her husband and  children,  such  removal  would  be  proportionate.
   However,  in the light of what was effectively the  (unusual)  concession
   of Mr. Johnson, at para 129 above, we find  that,  if  she  were  removed
   alone, such removal would be a disproportionate breach  of  her  and  the
   children's family life protected under Article 8 ECHR.

Funding

215. The Tribunal is satisfied that, at the  time  the  appellant  made  the
   Section 103A application and for the reasons indicated in the  order  for
   reconsideration, there was a significant prospect that the  appeal  would
   be  allowed  upon  reconsideration.  Accordingly  it  orders   that   the
   appellant's costs in respect of the application for  reconsideration  and
   in respect of the reconsideration are to be  paid  out  of  the  relevant
   fund, as defined in Rule  33  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal
   (Procedure) Rules 2005.

DECISION

216. The First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  determination  contains  a  material
   error of law.   We remake the decision.

217.  The  appellant's  appeal  is  dismissed  on  Refugee  Convention   and
   humanitarian protection grounds but allowed under Article 8 ECHR.

                           FINDINGS & INSTRUCTIONS



         FOR THE ATTENTION OF THE TRIBUNAL AT THE ADJOURNED HEARING

APPELLANT:       Ms AX

CASE NO:

DATE OF RECONSIDERATION HEARING:  20th February 2007

PANEL:                             Senior Immigration Judge Southern

REASONS FOR THE DECISION THAT THERE IS AN ERROR OF LAW
IN THE DETERMINATION


   1. Reconsideration has been ordered of the determination  of  Immigration
      Judge FitzGibbon who, by a determination promulgated on  19th  January
      2006, dismissed the appellant's appeal.  That  appeal  was  against  a
      decision of the respondent made on 11th October 2005 to  refuse  leave
      to enter after the respondent had rejected the appellant's asylum  and
      human rights claim.

   2. The appellant, who is a citizen of  the  People's  Republic  of  China
      ("China"), was born on 7th April 1977. Her claim  is  based  upon  her
      claimed risk of being subjected upon return to  China  to  persecutory
      ill-treatment, including forced sterilisation, as a consequence of the
      "one child policy" enforced in China, a policy which she had  breached
      by having more than one child. It may be that there is a second strand
      to her claim in that as her marriage in China had broken down and  her
      husband had deserted her she would be at risk as a  vulnerable  single
      mother.

   3. The appellant's evidence may be summarised, briefly, as  follows.  She
      lived in a rural area of China, in Hunan Province, where she worked as
      a weaver in a factory. She had two young children.  Her  husband  left
      her in the early part of 2004. In August 2004  officials  visited  the
      appellant's home. She was elsewhere at the time but the officials told
      her mother-in-law that because the  appellant  had  breached  the  one
      child policy she would have to undergo a  sterilisation  operation  in
      two days time. If she refused her house would  be  destroyed  and  her
      belongings confiscated. As a consequence she left home and after  some
      travelling within China she left China on an unknown  date  in  August
      2004 and travelled with the assistance of an agent via  Singapore  and
      Malaysia to the United Kingdom, arriving on 23rd September 2004.

   4. The respondent refused the claim because it was not accepted that  the
      appellant was at real risk in Hunan Province  because  the  one  child
      police was not, according to the respondent's reading of the objective
      evidence, strictly enforced in the rural areas.  The  appellant  could
      safely relocate to a rural area in China were there would be  no  such
      risk.

   5. When the appeal came before the immigration judge the appellant simply
      adopted her witness statement.  There  was  no  other  examination  in
      chief. Cross examination was extremely brief. Only five  responses  by
      the appellant are recorded in the record of proceedings. The appellant
      confirmed that officials had come to her home and  demanded  that  she
      undergo the operation. She travelled on a  passport  supplied  by  the
      agent. She had been unable to  contact  her  mother-in-law  since  her
      departure because  there  were  no  telephones  there.  The  appellant
      confirmed that she had travelled outside China once before.  This  was
      in 2003 when her parents-in-law paid for a holiday.

   6. The immigration judge then asked a large number of questions that gave
      rise to answers from the appellant upon which  the  immigration  judge
      was to base his finding that the appellant was not a credible  witness
      and to reject her entire account as  untrue.  These  were  issues  not
      raised in the reasons  for  refusal  letter  or  by  the  Home  Office
      Presenting Officer in the course of his brief cross examination.

   7. In the grounds upon which the appellant  sought  and  was  granted  an
      order for reconsideration the appellant's representative said that the
      questioning by the immigration judge of the appellant lasted for  more
      than 50 minutes. There was no re-examination by either  representative
      after the lengthy examination  conducted  by  the  immigration  judge.
      However, the respondent's representative, in his closing  submissions,
      noted that credibility issues arose from the questioning conducted  by
      the immigration judge.

   8. As can be seen from the determination it  was  the  evidence  elicited
      from the appellant by the immigration judge's questions  that  founded
      his adverse credibility findings.  At paragraph 9 of the determination
      he said:

           "As can be seen, her evidence to me differed  in  many  respects
           from her written evidence."

      And having gone through those contradictions he said, at paragraph 49:

           "Taking all the difficulties into account and having  regard  to
           the well-known principles in Chiver, I  am  driven  to  conclude
           that the appellant has made up this account in its  entirety.  I
           do   not   believe   she   was   threatened   with    compulsory
           sterilisation."

   9. This was not the case the appellant had expected to  meet.  There  had
      been no direct challenge to her  credibility  either  in  the  refusal
      letter or in the cross examination by the respondent's  representative
      at the appeal hearing. In the refusal letter the respondent said  that
      it was "highly unlikely" that the appellant would be  of  interest  to
      the authorities in Hunan Province and that she  did  not  qualify  for
      recognition as a  refugee  because  the  appellant  had  a  reasonable
      internal flight option within China.


  10.  There is ample guidance available as  to  how  an  immigration  judge
      should conduct himself if not content with the  extent  to  which  the
      evidence  has  been  elicited  in  examination  in  chief  and  cross-
      examination. It is clear that the immigration  judge  did  not  follow
      this guidance and did not conduct the proceedings in  accordance  with
      it.

  11. The immigration judge was bound by the starred decision MNM (Surendran
      guidelines for Adjudicators) Kenya * [2000] UKIAT 0005  in  which  the
      Tribunal said this:

        19.  The  tribunal  in  June  1999  sought  to  give   guidance   to
            adjudicators how to act if there  was  no-one  representing  the
            Home Office.  It is  unfortunate  that  that  guidance  was  not
            widely reported, although we are aware that it was circulated by
            the Chief  Adjudicator  to  all  adjudicators.   In  Muwyinyi  v
            Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  (Immigration  Law
            Update Vol 3 No 3 p.13) the President observed that adjudicators
            were not bound to accept accounts at face value  but  could  and
            should probe apparent improbabilities.  However, they  must  not
            involve  themselves  directly  in  questioning   appellants   or
            witnesses save as was absolutely necessary  to  enable  them  to
            ascertain the truth and must never adopt or appear  to  adopt  a
            hostile attitude.  That is wholly consistent with the  Surendran
            guidelines which show how the adjudicator should conduct such an
            exercise.  We have decided to incorporate  those  guidelines  in
            this determination and append them as an annex to it.  They must
            be observed.  If they are not, there is a real danger  that  the
            hearing will be regarded as having been conducted unfairly.


        20. In this  case,  the  special  adjudicator  did  not  follow  the
            procedure set out in Paragraph 5 of the Guidelines.  The  course
            she adopted did give rise to the impression that she was putting
            the Home Office case and was conducting her own  examination  of
            the appellant.  That in our view was not fair and is  sufficient
            in  itself  to  vitiate  the  findings  she  reached  that   the
            appellant's  account  was  in  certain  material  respects   not
            credible.

  12. Of course, here the respondent was represented, but had chosen not  to
      challenge the appellant's evidence in cross-examination beyond what is
      set out above. Paragraph 5 of the Surendran guidelines says this:


        5. Where no matters of credibility  are  raised  in  the  letter  of
           refusal  but,  from  a  reading  of  the  papers,   the   special
           adjudicator  himself  considers  that  there   are   matters   of
           credibility arising therefrom, he should  similarly  point  these
           matters out to the representative and  ask  that  they  be  dealt
           with, either in examination of the appellant or in submissions.

  13. This does not mean that the immigration  judge  cannot  pursue  issues
      that are troubling him, provided he does it in a  way  that  does  not
      give rise to a perception of  unfairness.  This  was  considered  more
      recently  in  XS  (Kosovo-Adjudicator's  conduct-psychiatric   report)
      Serbia and Montenegro [2005] UKIAT 00093:

           31. It was not illegitimate for the Adjudicator to ask questions
           about the mode of travel and nationality of the Appellant,  even
           though  those  issues  were  not  pursued  by  the  Home  Office
           Presenting Officer.  An Adjudicator is entitled to raise  issues
           which trouble him.   However,  where  there  is  a  Home  Office
           Presenting  Officer,  who  does  cross-examine,  an  Adjudicator
           should sense warning bells ringing over what he then does

           32. The questions should be asked  after  cross-examination  has
           concluded except for  clarification.   Otherwise,  there  is  an
           appearance of a dual cross-examination.  It may be otherwise  if
           there is no Home Office Presenting Officer and an  issue  arises
           unexpectedly in evidence in chief.   Here  some  questions  were
           asked by the Adjudicator during cross-examination  by  the  Home
           Office Presenting Officer.

           33. The questions should not be too long.  There is  no  precise
           permissible ratio, but asking significantly more questions  than
           the Home Office Presenting Officer is  again  an  indication  of
           apparently excessive intervention with  the  attendant  risk  of
           apparent bias.


  14.  It seems to me to be the inescapable conclusion  that  the  appellant
      and her representative would be left with the  clear  impression  that
      the  immigration  judge  had  taken   over   from   the   respondent's
      representative the task of testing the appellant's  evidence.  He  was
      wrong to do so. He did not seek the assistance of the  representatives
      to explore the matters that troubled him and there  is  no  indication
      from  the  record  of  proceedings  as  to  whether  he  invited   the
      appellant's representative to re-examine.


  15. The appellant was represented before  the  immigration  judge  by  her
      solicitor, Mr R. Batram, who is a  partner  in  the  firm  of  Luqmani
      Thompson & Partners.  He  has  confirmed,  in  a  Statement  of  Truth
      prepared for the reconsideration hearing, that he  felt  disadvantaged
      in his presentation of the appellant's case by the way  in  which  the
      appeal had been conducted:


           "I took a view that the questions posed by the adjudicator which
           introduced an element of credibility to  the  appeal,  where  no
           issues of credibility were raised by  the  Home  Office  in  the
           refusal letter, could not fairly and properly  be  addressed  on
           the day of the hearing. To do so I would need to  take  detailed
           further instructions with an interpreter  and  canvass  a  whole
           raft of areas which had never  been  raised  previously  by  the
           Secretary of State in his refusal letter. I took the  view  that
           it was neither possible  nor  appropriate  for  me  to  seek  to
           address all the potential points arising  from  the  immigration
           judge's examination in re-examination for two reasons.  Firstly,
           the immigration judge's examination raised  implicit  criticisms
           however, I had no means of being sure if  my  interpretation  of
           the implicit criticisms were correct. In short in re-examination
           I would have to go on  a  fact  finding  trawl  which  would  be
           impossible to deal with without  asking  leading  questions  and
           without any idea of where  re-examination  should  be  going  in
           order to  satisfy  newly  raised  concerns  of  the  immigration
           judge."


  16.  In those circumstances there has been a sufficiently  serious  breach
      of the procedural fairness to which the appellant was entitled  as  to
      vitiate the decision. It is not appropriate for  me  to  substitute  a
      fresh decision on the basis of the  appellant's  unchallenged  account
      because the respondent's representative has  adopted  the  credibility
      points that emerged during the examination of the appellant  conducted
      by the immigration judge even though those points had not  been  taken
      by the respondent previously.

  17. That being the case the determination  shall  be  set  aside  and  the
      Tribunal shall consider the evidence afresh at a hearing at which  all
      issues shall be at large. At that hearing the appellant will be  aware
      that her credibility is in issue generally and that it is for  her  to
      establish all the facts upon which she seeks to rely.

                         Summary of witness evidence


Appellant's evidence

1. The appellant is originally  from  Hunan  Province,  from  a  rural  area
   outside Jing Jie town.  She  was  poorly  educated  and  lived  with  her
   husband's parents.  She worked in a knitwear factory. She was born  on  7
   April 1977 (making her age 33) in Hunan, and in  January  1999  she  went
   through a ceremony of marriage in front of relatives.  The couple had two
   children, a son, born in June 2000 when she was 23 and a  daughter,  born
   in April 2002 when she was 25.  The appellant  can  produce  no  marriage
   certificate or birth certificates for the claimed events in  China.   The
   daughter was unregistered and was born at home with the help of a private
   midwife.

2. The Chinese marriage was in difficulty by the time the second  child  was
   born, and the appellant's husband left her shortly after Chinese New Year
   2004 (which fell on January 22 in that year).   He was said to fear being
   sterilised and also, he was having an  affair.   The  appellant  remained
   with her in-laws and children until  August  2004  when  the  authorities
   visited her home and pressured her mother in law to ensure the  appellant
   underwent sterilisation.   The appellant worked one more shift, to ensure
   she got her month's pay, and then left China, with the help of a man  she
   met at a bus stop and a friend with a shop, who was able to lend her  the
   down payment for her journey.

3. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on  23  September  2004,  and
   was arrested for a criminal offence  (false  documents).   She  served  a
   prison sentence.

4. On 22 February 2005, she was  released  and  taken  to  Heathrow  airport
   where she received temporary  admission  documents  and  a  Statement  of
   Evidence form, which she  did  not  return.   She  went  to  the  Refugee
   Arrivals Project and was able to telephone Hui Lin, a contact name  given
   to her by a friend before she left China.  He collected her and took  her
   to live at his home, but he locked the form in his room and went away for
   several weeks. The Statement of Evidence form was not returned  until  26
   May 2005; the respondent  refused  the  appellant's  asylum  claim  on  7
   October 2005.

5. In March 2009, having been advised that  her  Chinese  marriage  ceremony
   was of no legal effect, the appellant married a Chinese citizen living in
   the United Kingdom. Her husband's appeal rights had then  been  exhausted
   for nine years and he had no status in the United Kingdom.   Her  husband
   is of the majority Han ethnicity, and before coming to the United Kingdom
   he held a rural hukou in Anhui Province. While in the United Kingdom, the
   appellant has had two children, a daughter, born 26 November 2005, and  a
   son, born 17 September 2007, both of whose births are registered  in  the
   joint names of the appellant  and  her  husband.   There  are  birth  and
   marriage certificates to support the United Kingdom family events and  it
   seems, therefore, that the appellant must have  been  in  a  relationship
   with her husband since early 2005, not long after her release in February
   2005.  The appellant therefore presents as a person who certainly  has  a
   lawful husband and two foreign-born children, and who  may  also  have  a
   customary  marriage  husband  and  two  children,   living   with   their
   grandparents, in China.

Oral evidence

6. The appellant relied on her statement of 9 November 2009 as  her  primary
   evidence.  It amended and updated her two previous witness statements.

26 May 2005:  Statement of Evidence form and statement

7. The appellant stated she was born on 7 April 1977 in Hunan,  and  entered
   into a customary marriage in China in January 1999.  Details  were  given
   of her two claimed Chinese children.  The appellant's screening interview
   gave incorrect details of her father's name and her parents' address.  In
   China, the appellant had lived with her in-laws and the Chinese  children
   were still living with their grandparents.

8. The appellant described a holiday in Singapore in 2003, which her  mother
   in law had paid for, to try and stop her  quarrelling  with  her  Chinese
   husband.  The tour guide had a group pass and the appellant did not  have
   a personal passport.  She became ill on the trip and he arranged  a  visa
   extension; the appellant flew back later on that document.

9. The appellant claimed to have been unaware of the family planning  policy
   until after she had her daughter in China, the second child.  The  elder,
   a boy, was born in hospital:  the second child, a daughter, was  born  at
   home, privately, with the services of a midwife paid for by her  parents-
   in-law.  The appellant had refused to agree to  sterilisation  after  the
   second child, because her husband had run away and left her  for  another
   woman.

10. When she learned that family planning officials had  visited  while  she
   was out and that the second birth was unlawful, the  appellant  left  her
   parents-in-law's home for good.  She packed some  clothes,  her  identity
   card, some photographs, and RMB 2000 or 3000 and walked for two  days  to
   reach Jing Xie city.  There she met a man who advised her to  go  abroad,
   since wherever she went in China she would have the  same  problem.   She
   gave him her money and borrowed more from a friend  who  lived  near  the
   city, to make up RMB 20000, which was half the price of her travel.   She
   has not paid the rest.  The agent did not give his name; he threatened to
   take her son away if she did  not  pay  the  balance  after  her  initial
   detention and release in the United Kingdom.  The appellant went back  to
   the home of her in-laws, then left again on 16 August 2004, walked to the
   city, travelled with the agent to Singapore, where  they  spent  about  a
   week, then went by coach to Malaysia for just  over  a  week,  where  the
   agent left her.  The appellant travelled on by  plane  to  'some  strange
   city' where she changed planes for the United Kingdom. She  travelled  on
   her own passport: the Chinese immigration guards did  not  know  she  had
   breached the family planning policy.

11. Her account of the circumstances of her detention,  release,  and  claim
   in the United Kingdom are as already set out.  There was  no  mention  of
   her relationship with her present husband in the screening  interview  or
   in the appellant's asylum statement.

11 November 2005: witness statement for hearing

12. The appellant's next witness statement  was  prepared  for  the  January
   2006 hearing.  It was a response to the letter of refusal.  The appellant
   stated that internal relocation was no use in China because of the  hukou
   system.  She would be 'condemned to a life as one of the many  internally
   displaced and documented persons with no access to  civil,  political  or
   economic rights' which was why, when in prison here, she had not  applied
   for early release in order to return to China.   The  appellant  referred
   to the respect for living ascendants and ancestors in China; the  concept
   of preserving face; and the marital difficulties already mentioned.   She
   stated it was quite common in her area at that time for people to have  a
   second child hoping it was a boy; in her area, the family planning policy
   was not mentioned and it was perhaps not  enforced,  or  was  interpreted
   loosely.  Almost everyone  she  knew  underwent  voluntary  sterilisation
   after the birth of their second child. The subject was only discussed  in
   general terms, not individual ones.

13. The appellant had a second child for her Chinese  partner,  although  it
   was not a boy.  She and her parents-in-law were happy with two  children.
   She was convinced that if she had stayed, she  would  have  been  coerced
   into sterilisation by the authorities, or  by  pressure  on  the  family,
   which she was not prepared to accept.  The appellant was not prepared  to
   be sterilised because her marriage was failing and any new husband  would
   want her to have children for him. She decided to leave the  family;  the
   children belonged to her husband's family and they remained there.    The
   statement says that by the date of  hearing,  she  would  have  a  United
   Kingdom-born child from a relationship with a  person,  also  of  Chinese
   origin, who had not stuck by her, and to whom she was not married.

4 November 2009: witness statement for reconsideration hearing

14. The  appellant  prepared  a  new  statement  for  the  present  hearing.
   Subject to clarifications therein, she stated that she relied also on the
   earlier statements.   Her Chinese husband's  family  lived  in  Jing  Jie
   Town, in Hunan province, about thirty  minutes  by  bicycle  outside  the
   town.  Her own parents lived there too,  and  both  families  grew  rice;
   there were about sixty homes in this rural area and they did not have the
   type of hukou which gave them access to health services. She did not know
   what type of hukou they had.  The appellant's parents had good years  and
   bad.  In bad years, they only grew enough rice for themselves, whereas in
   good years there might be a small surplus.  Her father occasionally did a
   bit of building work.  The appellant  and  her  husband  were  both  only
   children.

15. The appellant's Chinese partner was a gambler; she did not know what  he
   earned because he never gave her any money.  He worked  as  a  motorcycle
   taxi when he could be bothered to  work.   The  appellant's  factory  job
   brought in RMB 500-600 dependent on her productivity.   Her  first  child
   was born in hospital, and properly registered.  The second,  a  daughter,
   was born at home and not registered.  The  account  of  her  finding  the
   agent is very similar; in this case, the appellant went home and got some
   money, photographs of herself and of her with her son, and  her  identity
   card.  Then she went back to work, finished her shift, collected her  pay
   and left.  The person who lent her the money to pay the agent  was  Zhang
   Fei, her best friend, who lived in Jing Jie, not in the  city  where  the
   agent lived.

16. The appellant   stated she had travelled out  of  China  on  a  passport
   which bore her name, but  was  not  necessarily  her  own  or  a  genuine
   passport.  The passport was red but she had  never  stated  that  it  was
   Malaysian, or that it  had  been  stolen.   She  did  not  know  why  her
   screening interview said that. Someone was  going  to  meet  her  in  the
   United Kingdom and arrange work  so  that  she  could  repay  the  agent.
   Instead she was arrested and imprisoned.   The  agent  wrote  to  her  in
   prison, asking for the money.  She had not heard from him since.

17. The appellant explained that  she  had    had  another  child  with  her
   husband, a son.   She   had  four  children.   She  refuted  her  earlier
   statement  that  she  was  having  difficulties  with  her  husband;  the
   difficulties were with accommodation,  not  with  him,  they  were  still
   together and he was the father of both her United Kingdom-born  children.
   She had been advised that the marriage in China was not  lawful  and  she
   had therefore gone through a form of marriage with her  present  husband.
   She did not know if he would stand by her if she returned  to  China  and
   took responsibility for all four children.

18. The appellant had a photograph of herself with her eldest  child,  taken
   in Jing Jie in or about October 2002.  She was almost illiterate, able to
   read a little and to print her own and  her  husband's  names.   She  was
   unable to contact her family in China, as she could not  write  a  letter
   and there was no telephone number.  She felt guilty and in  debt  to  her
   Chinese children for leaving.

Oral evidence

19. After adopting her latest witness statement, the appellant was  tendered
   for cross-examination.  She stated  that  she  had  not  known  how  many
   children she could have until she was asked to accept sterilisation, just
   before she left home.  She was not an educated woman and had no idea that
   there were rules about how many children she could have.  Her husband had
   left her in 2004, just after Chinese New Year,  and  her  mother  in  law
   stated that it was because  he  had  been  approached  about  the  family
   planning policy.  He ran away because he was scared of  being  sterilised
   himself.  He was also having an affair.

20. The appellant went into work the next day but did  not  sleep  at  home.
   She discussed voluntary  sterilisation  with  her  workmates  during  her
   overtime at work: they recommended  it,  stating  that  it  was  'nothing
   special'.  The chronology as to when the appellant  discovered  that  she
   was not permitted to have two children in China was  very  confused:   at
   the previous hearing she had told the Tribunal that her colleagues  would
   not discuss these matters with her.

21. The appellant's evidence about whether she left her home area  and  then
   China with or without documents was hopelessly discrepant.  In her asylum
   interview, she stated that she had no documents and had left her identity
   card at home when fleeing.  In her evidence to us  she  stated  she  took
   clothing, money, and her identity card.  She claimed to  have  been  lent
   the down payment of RMB 20,000, at a time when she was earning RMB 500 in
   a good month, and that the loan was by a 'friend' whose address she never
   knew but who ran a fast food business in the town.  She did not know  how
   much the friend earned.  The loan was  equivalent  to  four  and  a  half
   years' income and the vagueness of this  part  of  her  account  did  not
   assist the appellant's credibility.

22. The appellant stated that she used a passport with her photograph on  it
   to leave China, and then threw it away.  She did not know whether it  was
   genuine.  It was put to the appellant that in her  asylum  interview  she
   had stated specifically that  her  passport  was  stolen  at  gate  4  in
   Singapore airport on  the  way  to  Departures.   She  really  could  not
   remember why she had been so specific, when now she was saying she  threw
   it away.  The interpreter intervened at this point to state  that  'lost'
   and 'thrown away' are the same in Mandarin Chinese,  but  that  does  not
   help explain the appellant's precision at  interview,  and  her  present,
   much vaguer account.   The appellant had stated later that she threw  the
   passport down the toilets at the rear of the plane:  she  now  said  that
   'they' had provided an additional passport  after  hers  was  stolen,  to
   enable her to board the plane, and apparently had been able to  give  her
   another passport immediately.

23. In relation to the journey, the  appellant  stated  that  she  transited
   first Singapore and then Malaysia and then a third country of  which  she
   never knew the name.  She met the man who introduced her to the agent  at
   a bus stop in her home town but she never knew the agent's  name  or  his
   contact details:  he stated that he would find her for the  rest  of  the
   money.  Nobody had ever approached her in the United Kingdom save that in
   prison, she received a letter with no name on it,  saying  that  she  had
   money and should repay them or her children would be in danger.  She  did
   not know who to pay; she had not got the money anyway.  The Tribunal  was
   left with the clear impression that  the  appellant  did  not  intend  to
   disclose details of her journey to the United Kingdom and that nothing in
   this part of her account could be treated as reliable.

24. The appellant had no contact with her family in China  since  coming  to
   the United Kingdom.  She did not write  to  them;  she  was  not  a  good
   writer.  She only had two photographs of her children there, and no other
   evidence of their birth in China.  She was puzzled by questions as to why
   she had left her children behind when fleeing; she could do nothing about
   it.  Her husband had been with another woman; she had no  concerns  about
   the children, whom  she  did  not  regard  as  her  responsibility.   The
   appellant had travelled before to Singapore in 2003 but did not take  the
   children with her, and could not remember if  she  had  used  a  visa  or
   passport; she just paid the travel agent and they organised it all.   Her
   visa had to be extended because she was  ill  in  Singapore;  the  travel
   agent had organised all that and she did not know what had been required.



25. There was no re-examination.

Evidence of appellant's husband

4 November 2009:  Witness statement

26. In his witness statement, the husband confirmed his name  and  his  date
   of birth.  He is currently 36 years old.  He lived with the appellant and
   their two children at an address in Doncaster.  He was a Chinese  citizen
   from a rural part of Anhui province, 5 or 6  kilometres  outside  Ji  Nan
   city, where he had lived with his parents.  They had a  rural  hukou.  He
   was an only child and his parents  grew  rice,  earning  only  enough  to
   survive.  The husband had a job in China, in a clothes factory,  an  hour
   by bicycle from his home.

27. The husband had made an asylum claim in  2000  which  was  unsuccessful.
   He understood that his appeal was being considered in the  latest  legacy
   exercise.  He did not wish to return to China, because his wife 'had huge
   debts' and he could not possibly pay them.  He could not predict  whether
   they would stay together in those circumstances; he simply did  not  know
   what he would do.

Oral evidence

28.  At  the  hearing,  the  husband  adopted  his  witness  statement   and
   confirmed, after asking to see the signature, that he wished to  rely  on
   it as his evidence-in-chief and that he had understood the contents  when
   he signed it. There was a supplementary question in chief: he  was  asked
   what he would do if the appellant's claim was unsuccessful  and  she  was
   required to return to China.   He  had  not  thought  about  it  yet;  he
   reminded the Tribunal that there was a problem or a burden  in  that  she
   had other children in China.

29. In cross-examination, the witness confirmed that  he  had  been  in  the
   United Kingdom since 2000, when he unsuccessfully claimed asylum.  He had
   not understood English on arrival.  He had not showed up at  the  hearing
   of his own appeal.  He met the appellant in  or  about  March  2005.   If
   returned to China,  he  feared  being  incarcerated  by  the  authorities
   because he was a failed asylum seeker.  He would not be able to afford to
   bring up four children.  He had no idea  how  old  the  Chinese  children
   were, though his wife said she missed them and he understood that the boy
   was older than the girl.  His wife was from somewhere in Hunan  Province,
   but he did not know where, or whether she had worked when she was  there.
   He had not asked.  He  was  aware  that  she  owed  some  money  for  the
   arrangement fee to bring her to the United Kingdom, but he  had  no  idea
   how much.

30. He was asked about the close  similarities  between  the  names  of  the
   claimed Chinese children and  the  children  born  to  the  appellant  in
   England.  He stated that such close naming was normal.

31. There was no  re-examination.   In  answer  to  a  question  from  Judge
   Gleeson, the husband said that he had  worked  sometimes  in  the  United
   Kingdom as a cleaner but was not working at the moment.  He  had  primary
   school education and his parents were still in China.  He was in  contact
   with them, but he and his wife would have to look for  their  own  place,
   since the appellant would not live with  her  in-laws  and  his  parents'
   place was only just big enough for them.

32.  Attempts  to   locate   the   husband's   asylum   determination   were
   unsuccessful.  It bears a CC  file  number  from  the  year  2000,  which
   suggests that it was a certified appeal.  Her husband accepted  that  his
   asylum appeal had been finally disposed of and that his claimed  fear  of
   return arose from his status as a former asylum seeker, rather  than  any
   other reason.


                                 Appendix D

                   Respondent's Country of Origin evidence

1. We have taken into account the current Country of Origin Report on  China
   (24 August 2011). Family  planning  is  dealt  with  in  section  28  and
   includes  consideration  of  evidence  given  to  the  October  2010   US
   Congressional-Executive Committee on China (CECC):

   "28.02. ...

      -During the  Commission's  2010  reporting  year,  central  and  local
      authorities continued to interfere with and control  the  reproductive
      lives  of  Chinese  women  through  an  all-encompassing   system   of
      population planning Regulations. Population  planning  policies  limit
      most women in urban areas  to  bearing  one  child,  while  permitting
      slightly more than half of Chinese women-located in many rural  areas-
      to bear a second child if their first child is female. The  Commission
      notes the emergence of a growing debate in  the  Chinese  media  about
      possible reform of these policies, but has  not  yet  seen  government
      action to introduce national reform measures.

      -Local officials  continue  to  monitor  the  reproductive  cycles  of
      Chinese women in order to prevent  unauthorized  births.  The  Chinese
      government requires married couples to obtain a  birth  permit  before
      they can lawfully bear a child and forces them to employ contraceptive
      methods at other times. Although Chinese law prohibits officials  from
      infringing upon the rights and interests of citizens  while  promoting
      compliance with population  planning  policies,  reports  from  recent
      years indicate that abuses continue.

      Violators of the policy are routinely punished with fines, and in some
      cases, subjected to forced sterilization, forced  abortion,  arbitrary
      detention, and torture. In some cases surgical  sterilization  may  be
      required of Chinese women following the birth of their  second  child.
      Mandatory  abortion,  which  is  often  referred   to   as   'remedial
      measures'(bujiu cuoshi) in government reports, is endorsed  explicitly
      as an official policy instrument in the Regulations of 18  of  China's
      31 provincial-level jurisdictions. In 2010, the Commission found  that
      local  officials  continued  to   coerce   women   with   unauthorized
      pregnancies to undergo abortions in both urban and rural areas  across
      China's major regions.

      -China's  population  planning  policies  in  both  their  nature  and
      implementation violate international human rights standards.  Although
      implementation tends  to  vary  across  localities,  the  government's
      population planning law and Regulations contravene international human
      rights standards by limiting the number of  children  that  women  may
      bear and by coercing compliance with population targets through  heavy
      fines."

2.  At paragraph 28.03, the COI records that in February  2009  the  Chinese
   Government's website, www.china.org, stated that  double-single  families
   whose first child was a girl could have a second child, even those living
   in cities.   In rural areas, families who were not  double-singles  could
   have a second child if the first was  a  girl.  People  who  remarried  a
   childless person could also have a second child.  Also in February  2009,
   The Guardian reported the criminal conviction  of  a  Chinese  woman  who
   hired a man to strangle her nine-year-old son when she remarried, so that
   she could have a child with her new husband.

3. At paragraph 28.04, based on  a  BBC  report,  the  COI  noted  that  the
   concessions were  less  generous  than  they  at  first  appeared.   Many
   families would have a first boy, rather than a first girl, so that  there
   would be only 36% of families in China with two children and only 1% with
   three.  36% is a statistically significant proportion. Extracts from  the
   US State Department Report for 2010, published on 8 April  2011,  confirm
   that the penalties were generally financial, but that:

      "28.05. ...The law requires family-planning officials to obtain  court
      approval before taking  'forcible'action,  such  as  detaining  family
      members or confiscating and destroying property of families who refuse
      to pay social compensation fees. However, in practice this requirement
      was not always followed, and national authorities remained ineffective
      at reducing abuses by local officials."

4.  The 12th 5-year plan, for 2011-2015, confirmed the continuation  of  the
   family planning policy but indicated that adjustments would be  made  for
   'the problem of unequal birth sex ratios'.  The policy is not  inflexible
   in times of national emergency, for instance:

   "  28.11.      On 27 May 2008 The Telegraph reported:

      "China has said it will drop its one-child policy for the  parents  of
      children who died in the Sichuan earthquake  [on  12  May  2008].  The
      Population and Family Planning Committee in Chengdu,  the  capital  of
      Sichuan province, said the exemption could also apply to  those  whose
      children were disabled or seriously injured. The  announcement,  which
      applies to Chengdu and neighbouring cities  Dujiangyan  and  Pengzhou,
      may have been timed in an effort to  calm  the  mounting  anger  among
      parents whose children died in the disaster... The Chinese  government
      said yesterday that more than 65,000 people died in the disaster,  and
      has previously said that at least 9,000 of  those  were  children  and
      teachers who were in class when the earthquake struck. The  government
      is also struggling to deal with 5,500 children who  were  orphaned  by
      the earthquake.""

5. The COI confirmed the monitoring and  constant  surveillance  of  married
   women in rural areas, including regular pregnancy tests to  ensure  early
   termination of unauthorised pregnancies. In section 27  concerning  Child
   Abduction, the COI records China's historical problem with  abduction  of
   boy children and child farming, for  illegal  adoption,  particularly  in
   poor rural areas. Up to 20,000 children a year were abducted or  sold  to
   meet the needs of childless couples for a son.  In 2009, the Ministry  of
   Public Security started a DNA database of missing children  and  children
   recovered in law enforcement operations, to try to reunite  parents  with
   missing children.

6. The COI quotes an article in The Times newspaper (31 May 2009)  regarding
   child abduction:

      "27.15 ..."Small boys have long been abducted for sale in  China,  but
      in recent years the country's strict birth control policy,  which  has
      led to abortions of girls in families intent on having a boy, has left
      the countryside short of female babies. According to a  recent  report
      in the British Medical Journal, 124 boys are born for every 100  girls
      in the country as a whole, and in one province the figure has risen to
      192.  Stolen  girls  have  therefore  become   increasingly   valuable
      commodities in an [sic] cruel trade. Many are bought  by  farmers  who
      want wives for their small sons when they come of age or  by  men  who
      want a child bride without a dowry, say police and  the  state  media.
      The public  security  ministry  says  that  between  2,000  and  3,000
      children and young women are kidnapped  every  year,  but  the  state-
      controlled newspapers have put the figure as high as  20,000.  Only  a
      handful of cases are solved... The  Chinese  government  accepts  that
      child abductions are growing... In raids over the past  month,  police
      have freed 51 girls  from  kidnappers,  according  to  official  media
      reports. This is a complex criminal challenge. Police who  raided  one
      village in Guangnan county in southern Yunnan found that  babies  were
      being raised for sale and families were acting as  brokers  for  other
      peasants who wanted to sell off surplus' infants."

7. At paragraph  28.23-28.24,  BBC  news  reports  are  set  out,  with  the
   following information.  On 2 July 2009, the state-owned Chinese  Southern
   Metropolitan News reported that in one county in Guizhou province,  about
   80 baby girls had been seized when parents could not pay the  steep  fine
   (about �1800) for their unauthorised birth.  The BBC understood that  the
   girls were taken into orphanages and adopted  by  American  and  European
   couples, with the adoption fee split between  the  orphanages  and  local
   officials.   Child  trafficking  was  widespread  and  state   protection
   ineffective.  At 28.24, a more recent report by the BBC stated that:

      "28.24.      On 10 May 2011 the BBC reported:

      "China is investigating reports that about 20 babies were seized under
      the country's one-child-per-family policy and put up for international
      adoption.  Chinese  media  say  family  planning  officials  in  Hunan
      province took the children from poor homes unable  to  pay  fines  for
      having more than one child. The  children  were  allegedly  listed  as
      orphans and adopted by foreigners for fees of  about  $3,000  (�1,800)
      each. Xinhua news agency said some were now in the US, the Netherlands
      and Poland. The reports first appeared in Caixin magazine  and  caused
      such outrage that the  Hunan  provincial  government  has  launched  a
      formal investigation... Caixin reported that  when  some  families  in
      poorer parts of Hunan were unable  to  pay  their  fines,  authorities
      would tear down their houses. Then - about 10 years  ago  -  officials
      started confiscating their children, it is claimed."

8. On 17  April  2010,  The  Independent  newspaper  reported  that  in  the
   province of Puning,  'extraordinary measures' were  taken  to  deal  with
   actual or intended breach of the family planning regime.   However,  that
   report failed to distinguish between detention of elderly  parents  until
   sterilisation is carried out, all of  which  are  plainly  unlawful,  and
   excluding additional children from state schooling and health  insurance,
   which, as already set out, forms part  of  the  core  group  of  economic
   sanctions for those who are no longer holders of a SCP. The CECC for 2010
   recorded similar practices in Jiangxi, Jiangsu,  Anhui,  Gansu,  and  the
   Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, as well as other unlawful actions  such
   as nullification of hukou for unsterilised women, refusal to register the
   unauthorised children, or cancellation of state benefits and permits  for
   other family members.

9. The COI also deals with methods of evasion  by  parents  who  can  afford
   either to  travel  abroad  (mainly  to  Hong  Kong  and  Macao)  to  have
   additional children, or by in vitro fertilisation (IVF), which  leads  to
   multiple births from a single  authorised  pregnancy.    On  14  February
   2006, China Daily reported on the multiple IVF  birth  stratagem,  noting
   that there were no penalties for multiple births (paragraph 28.38), apart
   from the loss of the SCP Certificate.

10. Information on returning overseas Chinese in the material before  us  is
   sparse and out of date.  Such information as is available dates  back  to
   2001-2005 and is summarised in the respondent's Country of Origin Report,
   which deals principally with parents returning from Hong Kong and  Macao.
   After a landmark decision in  2007,  Hong  Kong  has  been  flooded  with
   'mainland mothers' seeking to evade the  family planning scheme by giving
    birth in Hong Kong, to the extent that the Hong Kong  administration  is
   now seeking to limit the number of mainland births, which  now  represent
   almost half the number of children born in Hong Kong.  Parents travelling
   to Hong Kong to have additional children regard it as 'fashionable and  a
   proof  of  your  status'.   Packages  including  the  necessary  hospital
   treatment are available at HK$ 50000 (about �4100).  That  is  more  than
   twice the fine for the additional child. The scale of overseas travel for
   additional births supports our understanding that the  greatest  risk  is
   during pregnancy, and that Chinese women do not fear returning  with  the
   additional children.

11.  Other  information  on  the  risk  to  returning  overseas  Chinese  is
   extracted from Canadian IRB research responses  in  2005.   The  lack  of
   concrete information as to any penalties or treatment of such parents, in
   the light of the  international  interest  in  this  question,  does  not
   suggest that  significant  difficulties  are  in  fact  experienced.   At
   paragraph 28.47, the COI summarises  Fujian  Province's  family  planning
   Regulations.  Fujian is China's  most  outward-facing  province  and  the
   source of the vast majority of its  migrants  abroad.    Couples  with  a
   Fujian-based hukou are permitted a second child if the wife  is  pregnant
   on return; if they returned with one child less than six  years  earlier;
   where all their other children are overseas;  and  so  on.   Foreign-born
   children who remain outside China are not counted  among  the  number  of
   children to which a couple has given birth.  Specific Regulations are not
   available for other provinces.

12. The November 2011 OGN deals with the  question  of  family  planning  at
   section 3.10.  The overall position is summarised at paragraphs  3.10.13-
   3.10.15:


           "3.10.15    Conclusion. The country's population control  policy
           relies on education, propaganda and economic incentives as  well
           as on more coercive measures.  Those who violate the policy face
           severe disciplinary measures  such  as  heavy  fines,  known  as
           social compensation fees, job loss or demotion, loss  of  career
           opportunities, expulsion from the CPP and  other  administrative
           punishments, including in some cases the destruction of  private
           property. There are also some reports  of  forced  sterilisation
           and abortion.  Although the one child policy is well established
           nationally, there are a number of exemptions that allow  couples
           to have more than one child  and  also  regional  variations  in
           enforcement of the policy.  Case owners are advised to  consider
           each case on its individual merits,  since  not  all  applicants
           will necessarily face penalties.

        3.10.16   Where  applicants  are   likely   to   incur   penalties,
           consideration should be given to the type and  severity  of  the
           likely penalty, based on the  particular  circumstances  of  the
           applicant. Given the variation in enforcement from  province  to
           province,  case  owners  should  consult   Country   of   Origin
           Information Service for details of application of the policy  in
           the claimants home area in individual cases.  Where there  is  a
           real risk of  enforced  termination  of  pregnancy  or  enforced
           sterilisation, a grant of asylum as a  member  of  a  particular
           social group will be appropriate.  Asylum should also be granted
           in cases where even though the punishment is less harsh,  it  is
           likely to have severe consequences for the individual  concerned
           and his or her family."

13. Further guidance at paragraphs 3.10.1-3.10.14 emphasises the  variations
   in enforcement of the policy, the real risk of compulsory termination  of
   pregnancy in 18 of China's 31 provinces,  and  the  pressure  to  undergo
   sterilisation.  The Guidance notes variations in the enforcement  of  the
   policy and in the enthusiasm of different provinces for its retention:

      "3.10.2     ...While the national  family  planning  authorities  have
      shifted their emphasis from lowering fertility  rates  to  maintaining
      low fertility rates and claim to emphasise quality of care  in  family
      planning practices,  the  country's  birth  limitation  policies  have
      retained harshly coercive elements in law and practice.  Although  the
      government announced adjustments would be implemented to  address  the
      problem of unequal birth sex ratios, it has affirmed  the  orientation
      of its  family  planning  policy  at  the  highest  levels,  including
      maintaining the policy as part of the 12th Five-Year Plan that will be
      in effect 2011-15. ...


      3.10.5      The government  announced  it  would  drop  its  one-child
      policy for the parents of children who died in the Sichuan  earthquake
      in 2008.  The Population and Family  Planning  Committee  in  Chengdu,
      capital of Sichuan Province, said the exemption could  also  apply  to
      those whose children were seriously injured or disabled.  In addition,
      recognised ethnic minorities are partially exempt from the 'one  child
      policy'.  In ethnic minority areas, more preferential policies  permit
      some families to have three children, and in the farming and  pastoral
      areas in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,  families  are  allowed  to
      have four children. In Tibet's farming and pastoral areas, there is no
      restriction on childbirth.


      3.10.6      Female infants in China have a higher mortality rate  than
      male infants, contrasting with global rates.  Although the Law on  the
      Protection of Juveniles forbids infanticide, there  is  evidence  that
      female  infanticide,  sex-selective  abortions,  and  abandonment  and
      neglect of infant  girls  and  disabled  children  continues,  due  to
      cultural preferences for sons combined  with  the  one  child  policy.
      Authorities are investigating reports that in  2011  about  20  babies
      were seized under the policy and put up  for  international  adoption.
      Chinese media say family planning officials in Hunan province took the
      children from poor homes unable to pay fines for having more than  one
      child. The Hunan provincial government is investigating the claims.


      3.10.7      Penalties for violating family planning laws  are  strict,
      leaving many women little choice but to abort pregnancies. In the case
      of families that already  had  two  children,  one  parent  was  often
      pressured to undergo sterilisation. (28.27  and  28.28).   Reports  of
      physical coercion by officials trying to meet birth targets  continued
      through 2010.  ...


      3.10.8       Although  the  law  standardises  implementation  of  the
      policy, enforcement  varies  significantly.   ...  Mandatory  abortion
      (sometimes referred to as 'remedial measures' in  government  reports)
      is explicitly endorsed as an official policy within the Regulations of
      18 of China's 31 provincial-led jurisdictions.  In 2010, it was  found
      that local  officials  continue  to  coerce  women  with  unauthorised
      pregnancies to undergo abortions in both urban and rural areas  across
      China.


      3.10.9      Regulations requiring women who  violate  family  planning
      policy to terminate their pregnancies still exist in the provisions of
      the Population and Family Control Regulations of Liaoning,  Jilin  and
      Heilongjiang provinces  respectively.   An  additional  10  provinces:
      Fujian, Guizhou, Guangdong, Gansu, Jiangxi, Qinghai, Sichuan,  Shanxi,
      Shaanxi and Yunnan require unspecified  "remedial  measures"  to  deal
      with out-of-plan pregnancies. ...


      3.10.12     It was reported  in  July  2011  that  Guangdong,  China's
      richest and most populous province, has asked the  central  government
      to relax family planning laws. Guangdong has asked  to  lead  a  pilot
      project that  will  allow  some  families  to  have  a  second  child.
      Officials are concerned about a rapidly aging population  which  could
      affect social and economic development. There is  speculation  that  a
      gradual roll-back of the policy will start with pilot schemes  in  the
      five provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Zhejiang and Jiangsu.
      An  official  at  the  Population  and   Family   Planning   Committee
      acknowledge that a change in the rules was being discussed.

      3.10.13     With regard to returnees  from  overseas,  information  is
      scarce but some  reports  suggest  that  Chinese  nationals  who  have
      children while abroad may not be  subject  to  the  one-child  policy.
      Chinese citizens studying or working in foreign countries  can  return
      with more than one child without serious problems. A specialist stated
      that the policy varies considerably throughout the  country  and  that
      some people in southern Fujian and Guangdong provinces had reported no
      problems in returning after having children abroad.  However,  another
      analyst believed "there is no reason to expect" that  women  who  have
      children abroad will be treated differently than those who give  birth
      in China" although no specific information was cited."


                                 Appendix E

                           The 2010/2011 documents

14.  In  November  2010,  the  Tribunal  received  from  the  appellant  the
   following further documents: the respondent's November  2010  Country  of
   Origin Report on China; the Congressional-Executive  Committee  on  China
   Annual Report for 2010; a document from the same  committee  dated  March
   2010 entitled "Migrant Workers'  Children  Face  Barriers  to  Education,
   Activists Call for Fair Treatment"; and a document from the Canadian  IRB
   entitled, "Family planning laws, enforcement and exceptions;  reports  of
   forced abortions or sterilization of men and women, particularly  in  the
   Provinces of Guangdong and Fujian" (2007-May 2010).

15. For the December 2011  hearing,  the  respondent  sent  the  Tribunal  a
   further copy of Professor Fu's 30 June 2011 report (which  is  considered
   as part of his evidence in the body of the determination), extracts  from
   the August 2011 COI on China, the 11 October  2011  Operational  Guidance
   Note (which takes account of much of  the  expert  evidence  and  country
   evidence presented during the hearing of this  appeal),  and  a  document
   entitled 'Summary of Background Evidence in Support  of  China  One-Child
   Policy and Forced Sterilisation' dated 12 December 2011, which  contained
   excerpts and web links for a significant  number of further documents.

16. The appellant presented a bundle of  evidence  concerning  consideration
   of her situation under the respondent's  legacy  policy,  which  did  not
   appear to have reached a conclusion, despite her pursuing it through  her
   solicitors vigorously; and a bundle of further documents  which  are  set
   out in the Schedule to this determination, dealing with current  evidence
   on the risk to the appellant on return.  We also had written  submissions
   from both parties, and heard  oral  submissions  at  the  hearing  on  19
   December 2011.

17. A CECC press release, produced by the appellant but  not  considered  in
   the August 2011 COI, concerned the  children  of  migrant  workers.   The
   following is an extract from its  executive summary:

      "China's household registration system places strict limits  on  where
      its citizens may legally reside. Given that access to social  services
      is tied to household registration, some migrant workers' children face
      discrimination and are turned away from urban  schools.  In  light  of
      this, two Beijing-based activists have asked the city's authorities to
      allocate more money to increase the number of state-run  kindergartens
      in order to accommodate the children of migrant workers  who,  already
      facing discrimination in  an  environment  where  slots  are  severely
      limited, often are denied admission to schools. Some migrant  children
      end up in unlicensed kindergartens that  may  lack  proper  oversight.
      Recent articles and studies have highlighted migrants' difficulties in
      obtaining equal access to schools for their children, and the  factors
      that discourage many urban state-run schools  from  accepting  migrant
      children."

18.  The  statistics  for  schools  in  Beijing  indicate  that   there   is
   substantially more non-state kindergarten provision, but that there is an
   ever-increasing need for  kindergarten  provision  for  the  children  of
   migrants:

      "In Beijing, demand for kindergarten is high,  and  if  no  action  is
      taken to accommodate  more  students,  the  number  of  students  will
      continue to outpace available school slots in  coming  years.  Between
      2006 and mid-2009, more than 460,000 babies were born in Beijing,  and
      about 51 percent of them did not hold Beijing household  registration,
      according to a June 30, 2009, Xinhua report. As Li Fangping told Radio
      Free Asia (RFA) in a January  29,  2010,  article,  the  birthrate  of
      migrant  children  in  Beijing  had  already  exceeded  the  city-wide
      children population by 50 percent.  Of  the  city's  migrant  children
      population, RFA notes that about 200,000 are  in  the  pre-school  age
      range. Still, according to the June 30 Xinhua piece and the February 2
      CLB  report,  as  it  stands,  there  are  1,266  legally   registered
      kindergartens in Beijing, of which over  300  are  state-run,  and  an
      additional 1,298 "self-organized kindergartens"  not  registered  with
      the government; the legal ones-both  state-run  and  private-only  can
      accommodate  half  of  the  admissions  demand.  A  Beijing  Municipal
      Political Consultative Conference  study  cited  in  the  RFA  article
      indicates that 90 percent of parents prefer to enroll  their  children
      in the state-run schools, since these  institutions  are  cheaper  and
      have a lower turnover of teachers."

19.  That indicates that State-run  provision  of  pre-school  education  is
   substantially  in  the  minority,  standing  at  10-15%  of  the  overall
   provision, although, naturally, most parents would prefer to use the free
   state schooling.   Overall,  education  is  available  for  half  of  the
   children whose parents wish to enroll them, albeit on a fee  paid  basis.
   The levels of children born to those without a  Beijing  hukou  are  very
   high.  The COI notes that the highest concentrations of migrant  children
   are in Henan, Guangdong, Anhui and Sichuan provinces, with a 25% increase
   in migrant children in Henan during the years 2000-2006.  It is  unclear,
   however, whether the other statistics  in  the  article  are  recent,  or
   relate to that earlier period.

20. A Canadian IRB  Research  Response  entitled:   "Family  planning  laws,
   enforcement and exceptions; reports of forced abortion  or  sterilization
   of men and women particularly in the provinces of  Guangdong  or  Fujian"
   covers a two and a half year period from 2007 to May  2010.   It  records
   that  double-single  couples  are  permitted  second  children  in  every
   province but Henan, according to a March 2010  New  York  Times  article.
   Guangdong province began permitting such couples two children as long ago
   as 1986; in Shanghai, the policy had only been adopted in 2004 and, since
   2009, was positively encouraged because Shanghai had a low birth rate and
   an ageing population.

21. In 2010, the United States CIA World Factbook estimate of the number  of
   children per woman in the population of China was 1.54, as  against  1.58
   in Canada. According to the 2011 report, the figures for China and Canada
   are the same:  the 2011 report gives a figure of 1.91 children per  woman
   in the United Kingdom.

22. The most relevant parts of the Canadian IRB Response are as follows:

      "Sources report that forced abortions and forced sterilizations  still
      occur in China (AI 22 Apr. 2010; US 11 Mar.  2010,  Sec.  1f;  Freedom
      House 2010) although Freedom House states  that  "compulsory  abortion
      and sterilization by local officials are less common than in the past"
      (Freedom House 2010). The use of forced abortion and sterilization  is
      banned by Chinese law; however, sources report  some  local  officials
      resort to coercion due to pressure to meet government-regulated  birth
      targets (AI 22 Apr. 2010; US 11 Mar. 2010, Sec. 1f; CHRD 5 Nov.  2008,
      8). A report by the Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD),  a  network
      of Chinese and  international  human  rights  activists  (CHRD  n.d.),
      indicates that relatives of women facing sanctions may be "questioned,
      fined, detained, beaten or have  their  property  confiscated"  unless
      they help persuade the women to comply (CHRD 5 Nov. 2008, 8).  Sources
      report that officials are rarely  prosecuted  or  punished  for  those
      types of abuses (AI 22 Apr. 2010; CHRD 5 Nov. 2008, 8).

      Freedom  House  reports  that  "[a]ccording  to   official   websites,
      authorities in some areas of Yunnan and Fujian  mandated  the  use  of
      abortion in 2009" (2010). Country Reports 2009 states that, "[s]everal
      provinces - Anhui, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hubei, Hunan, Jilin, Liaoning,
      and Ningxia - require 'termination  of  pregnancy'  if  the  pregnancy
      violates provincial family-planning Regulations (US 11 Mar. 2010, Sec.
      1f). As well, Country Reports 2009  adds  that  ten  provinces,  which
      include Guizhou, Gansu, Jiangxi, Qinghai,  Sichuan,  Shanxi,  Shaanxi,
      and Yunnan in addition to Fujian  and  Guangdong  provinces,  "require
      unspecified 'remedial measures' to deal with unauthorized pregnancies"
      (ibid.).  According  to  the  CECC's  Annual  Report  2009,  the  term
      "remedial measures" (bujiu cuoshi), found  in  official  reports  from
      local governments, "is used synonymously with compulsory abortion" (US
      10 Oct. 2009, 153).

      Information on the forced sterilization of men was  scarce  among  the
      sources consulted by the Research Directorate. However, a 2 June  2010
      article by Xinhuanet, translated by the Women of China website,  which
      is operated by the All-China's Women  Federation  (ACWF)  states  that
      37.5 million Chinese  men  (7.39  percent)  have  had  vasectomies  in
      comparison to the 221.5 million women who have had tubal ligation.

      Guangdong and Fujian

      According to the Xinhuanet article, [t]he Family Planning  Regulations
      of Guangdong Province advise women of childbearing age with one  child
      to use intrauterine contraceptive devices,  and  either  the  wife  or
      husband in  a  couple  with  two  children  to  undergo  sterilization
      (Xinhuanet 2 June 2010).

      Several sources report that in April 2010, according to Chinese media,
      officials  in  Puning  City  in  Guangdong  conducted  a  campaign  to
      sterilize almost 10,000 people who had violated family planning  rules
      (Sky News 23 Apr. 2010; AI 22 Apr. 2010; Times Online 17  Apr.  2010).
      Sources  reported  that  relatives  of  those   being   targeted   for
      sterilization were detained to persuade the  targeted  individuals  to
      comply, although such action is a contravention  of  official  Chinese
      policy (AI 22 Apr. 2010; Times Online  17  Apr.  2010).  According  to
      Times Online, the website of British  newspapers  The  Times  and  The
      Sunday Times, officials in Puning  were  under  pressure  due  to  the
      city's high birth rate (ibid.). The article quoted one man as agreeing
      to undergo the procedure (ibid.).

      Sources report that in 2009, three women acting as  surrogate  mothers
      were forced to undergo abortions in Guangzhou (US 11 Mar.  2010,  Sec.
      1f; Reuters 30 Apr. 2009). The CECC's Annual Report 2009 states that a
      woman in Shenzen in  Guangdong  province  was  forced  to  undergo  an
      abortion six days before the due date of a second  child  because  the
      officially mandated waiting period for her to have a second child  had
      not been observed (US 10 Oct. 2009, 153). The COI provided details  on
      several other cases of forced abortion (ibid., 153-156).

      According to a December  2009  online  article  by  the  Beijing-based
      Global Times, Fujian province announced it would  implement  a  "real-
      name abortion system" by starting  to  require  women  to  show  their
      identity cards for abortions (29 Dec.  2009).  The  policy  was  being
      implemented "in order to monitor abortion trends  and  improve  family
      planning policies" and counter illegal gender-based abortions  (Global
      Times 29 Dec. 2009). The article also states that "[t]he province will
      continue implementing the family planning policy, and  crack  down  on
      illegal child bearing", without providing further details (ibid.)."

23. The appellant's updated material in  December  2011  included  a  report
   from the  US  House  of  Representatives  Committee  on  Foreign  Affairs
   entitled, 'China's One-Child  Policy:   The  Government's  Massive  Crime
   against Women and Unborn Babies', 21 September 2011.  The testimony given
   was anti-abortion, in support  of  a  bill  which  would  permit  the  US
   President to exclude from entry to the  United  States  '...any   Chinese
   official involved in forcing abortions  and  sterilisation  on  unwilling
   women in China, an act that  would  be  a  clear  crime  in  [the  United
   States]', together with the family members of such persons.

24. The evidence includes the testimony  of  Chai  Ling,  who  converted  to
   Christianity after reaching the United States.  When in China, before she
   was married, Ms Chai had three abortions. She had then regarded  abortion
   as the right choice if circumstances made  keeping  the  baby  difficult.
   Abortion was simply a way of life:  it had not occurred to her  that  she
   could give the babies away instead, or that she might try to  keep  them.



25. The testimony of Reggie Littlejohn noted that because of the  effect  of
   the family planning policy over time, China  now  had  37  million  'bare
   branch' young men who could not find wives  within  China.  Her  evidence
   concluded:

      "In China, a woman's body is not her own.  It belongs to the state.  A
      woman's womb is the most intimate  part  of  her  body  -  physically,
      emotionally and spiritually.  For the Chinese Communist Party  to  act
      as 'womb police' and crush the life inside  her  is  a  heinous  crime
      against humanity."

26. The evidence of Valerie M Hudson,  Professor  of  Political  Science  at
   Brigham  Young  University  concentrated  on  the  female  sex   deficit,
   speculating that a significant  number of 'bare branches', that  is,  men
   with no issue, would lead to social and  economic  instability  over  the
   next thirty years.  Her evidence concluded:

      "Whilst it is true that the demographic die has been cast for the next
      few decades in China, it is also true that relinquishing the One-Child
      Policy would positively affect China's future prospects for stability,
      security and prosperity.  That the Chinese Government is now pondering
      whether to turn to a Two-Child Policy is an  interesting  development,
      indicating that the Government now  sees  more  clearly  the  security
      issues that the One-Child Policy has raised.  Even  so,  steering  the
      ship of culture to a new heading is a very difficult undertaking.   In
      experiments performed by the Government in selected areas, institution
      of a Two-Child  Policy  did  not  change  the  fertility  rate.   Most
      families still preferred to have only one child.  And  son  preference
      did not abate, either.  On the basis of these  experimental  findings,
      we are now forced to wonder whether the  One-Child  Policy  will  have
      significant cultural effects that will long outlast the policy itself.
       If that is the case, that will truly be a tragedy for China."

27. The evidence of Ji Yeqing related the experiences she  and  her  husband
   had.  She had a daughter first, but chose not to have  an  IUD  inserted.
   She bought contraceptive pills, then stopped doing so, and  tried  for  a
   baby, after four years (there is no indication that  she  applied  for  a
   birth permit).   The account of the two successive forced  abortions  she
   endured all pre-dated the change of approach in 2005.  It is  interesting
   to note that her parents in law encouraged the  couple  to  keep  trying,
   even after the first abortion, promising to  make  the  SUC  payments  on
   their behalf.  The family were determined and regarded the  SUC  as  just
   necessary to achieve the desired son.    In  2008,  her  Chinese  husband
   divorced her, the appellant met another man, and came  with  him  to  the
   United States.  She had no children yet with him;  she  suffered  medical
   problems which she ascribed to her forced abortions.

28. The evidence of Ping Liu again concerned the pre-2005 regime.   Ms  Ping
   had five abortions, followed by  the  insertion  of  an  IUD,  which  she
   endured for ten years before coming to the United States where she became
   a Christian.  Her husband joined her there and the marriage  failed.   In
   due course, however, they were reconciled, with the help of  the  church.
   They had no children together.

29. The evidence of  these  Chinese  women  indicates  that  abortions  were
   regarded by them  as  routine,  before  they  were  exposed  to  American
   Christianity, which as they describe it seems  to  have  a  strong  anti-
   abortion bias.  It also seems that these women did have  pre-marital  sex
   when they were younger than the age for marriage.  A  report  from  Radio
   Free Asia recorded at least one forced abortion in February  2011.    The
   full report of Reggie Littlejohn which formed the basis of  her  evidence
   to the committee completed the appellant's new evidence.  It is  strongly
   worded but adds little to the information already before us.
                                 Appendix F

                   Chinese Guidance Documents and Case law

      Professor Fu produced with his report a number of  guidance  documents
      issued by the Chinese authorities.

      The first,  a  Ministry  of  Public  Security  notice  concerning  the
      Treatment of Persons Entering and Leaving China Unlawfully (Gong  Tong
      [1992] no 32, 21 May 1991), shows inward  migration  from  Sri  Lanka,
      Bangladesh, Thailand, Venezuela, Pakistan, Iran  and  Afghanistan,  as
      well as difficulties with Chinese leaving unlawfully or  having  their
      return  lawfully  delayed  for  a  variety  of  reasons.    Embassies,
      consulates and representative offices  abroad  are  required  to  make
      strict checks of passports; passports are to be carefully inspected on
      entry, to ensure no part of the passport or the entry  visa  has  been
      replaced or tampered with.  Persons seeking to transit China, with  no
      visa for the next country to which they wish  to  travel,  are  to  be
      refused entry.  The document deals with the return of Chinese citizens
      who have left unlawfully:

        "V.            The border inspection authorities should accept  and
        investigate Chinese citizens who, having  left  China  with  forged
        passports  and/or  visas,  are  refused  entry  by   the   relevant
        authorities at their destination country and  return  to  China  on
        their original means of transport. Those who have not committed any
        other crime are to be dealt  with  as  ordinary  illegal  migrants.
        ...Where persons claim to be  Chinese  citizens  but  do  not  have
        sufficient evidence to prove their identities the Chinese embassies
        or consulates abroad  should  verify  the  identities  through  the
        public security departments of bureaus in the  relevant  provinces,
        autonomous regions or cities under the direct jurisdiction  of  the
        central government. If such persons are  confirmed  to  be  Chinese
        citizens the  embassies  or  consulates  are  to  issue  single-use
        "People's  Republic  of  China  Travel   Documents".   The   border
        inspection authorities are to investigate repatriated persons after
        their entry into China. ...Chinese  citizens  who  are  found  when
        leaving China to be holding forged passports,  visas  or  documents
        are also to be treated in accordance with these principles if  they
        do  not  fall  within  the  range  of  those  to  be  inspected  or
        controlled.

        VI.             Persons  returned  to   China   by   the   relevant
        authorities of foreign countries are in  principle  to  be  refused
        entry if they do not have sufficient documents to prove  that  they
        are Chinese citizens and their identities have not been verified by
        Chinese embassies or consulates abroad and the  original  means  of
        transport is to be  responsible  for  carrying  them  back  to  the
        country they departed from. If they remain in  China  because  they
        cannot be carried back on the  day  of  their  arrival  the  border
        inspection authorities are to be responsible for their custody  and
        liability for the costs of their food,  accommodation  and  custody
        are to be borne by the persons  in  charge  of  original  means  of
        transport. If it is necessary for  them  to  change  the  means  of
        transport the costs thereof are also to be borne by the persons  in
        charge of original means of transport."

      That accords with the background evidence as to what actually  happens
      on return.  Chinese citizens must prove their citizenship but, as long
      as there is no other criminal offence involved, they will be processed
      as illegal migrants and, it appears, allowed to proceed.

      The next document is a Notice from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
      Ministry of  Public  Security  regarding  the  Better  Performance  of
      Verifications of Repatriation (Gong Bian (2001) No. 9, 1  June  2001),
      sets  out  the  procedures,  including  a  principle   of   permitting
      repatriation, and a requirement to verify whether any serious criminal
      charges are outstanding in the hukou area:

           "In recent years it has been impossible to stop Chinese citizens
           from going abroad unlawfully and the  departments  concerned  in
           foreign countries  have  requested  repatriation  of  increasing
           numbers of illegal migrants. At the same  time  many  areas  met
           with problems when implementing the Notice, such as the channels
           for verifying repatriation  being  obstructed  or  unclear,  the
           operability of some rules  being  weak  and  verification  being
           slow,  all  affecting  normal   repatriation   work.   Verifying
           repatriation is an important phase in attacking the  problem  of
           illegal migration, and notice regarding the requirements for the
           verification  work  is  given  as   below,   for   its   further
           standardisation:

           ...When arranging repatriation Embassies and  consulates  abroad
           should first  and  in  good  time  inform  the  public  security
           departments and bureaus of the  relevant  provinces,  autonomous
           regions and cities under the direct jurisdiction of the  central
           government and those of the ports of entry of the flights, ports
           of arrival and documents held, etc., and at the same time report
           to the Border Control Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security,
           the Border  Entry  and  Exit  Administration  and  the  Consular
           Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If the  entry  is
           to be through  Beijing,  Tianjin,  Shanghai  Xiamen,  Guangzhou,
           Shenzhen,  Zhuhai,  Shantou  or  Haikou,  the  Entry  and   Exit
           Inspection Headquarters at those places should also be informed.
           If repatriation must be via a third country  then  depending  on
           circumstances the embassy or consulate concerned may provide co-
           ordination."

      Professor Fu had also been able to identify a number of  decisions  in
      the university database, bearing on the issues in the present  appeal.
      He produced six reported decisions.  Two of them predated the  present
      r�gime.   The actions of local  authorities  in  these  cases  clearly
      illustrated the mixture  of  aggression  and  corruption  which  local
      Regulation entailed, and which in 2002 led to the  introduction  of  a
      national scheme.

      In HUANG Huanghui v People's Government of Fengzhou  Township,  Nan'an
      City,  (Quanzhou People's Intermediate Court,  Fujian,  Administrative
      Judgment),Mr Huang sued the People's Government of  Fengzhou  Township
      for limiting his personal freedom and for compensation.   He  and  his
      wife had four children, and had concealed the  third.  In  July  1998,
      during the 'Five Cleanups' programmed, the local authorities  detained
      him for what they described as  'study  of  national  family  planning
      policy', along with others in  the  same  position.   No  'study'  was
      provided.  He was detained without trial  for  166  days.   The  first
      instance court rejected the claimant's application for damages  and  a
      declaration of unlawfulness.  The claimant appealed.

      The appellate court held that while  it  was  proper  for  the  family
      planning authorities to arrange compulsory study for those  in  breach
      of the rules, on the facts:

        "... The Respondent had not followed the law and  policy  strictly;
        there was clear subjectivity and action on a whim,  ...  such  acts
        were not implementation of the family planning  laws  but  unlawful
        acts both beyond and abusing the respondent's authority."

      The court declared the detention of 166 days unlawful and ordered  the
      respondent to pay the claimant damages of RMB 6096.78 and  costs.   It
      dismissed his claims for emotional damage (not well founded)  and  for
      loss of earnings (no supporting evidence).

      In Xishan Neighbourhood Office, Ezhou, v Yu M. (People's Higher Court,
      Hubei Administrative Judgment (2000) E Xing Zhong No.  32),   Mr  Yu's
      wife, Mrs Yin, was suspected of having an out of plan child.  In  July
      1998, she went with the new baby for a lengthy visit to her brother-in-
      law and other relations.  Employees of the Xishan Neighbourhood Office
      went to pick her up at her brother-in-law's house  about  three  weeks
      later, taking her to their  7th  floor  offices  'to  investigate  the
      birth'.  Mrs Yin could not produce  the  child's  'Permit  to  have  a
      Child' on the spot.  After being held for five hours, during which her
      brother-in-law and his works health officer attempted to  negotiate  a
      financial settlement, she fell from  the  7th  floor  offices  of  the
      Neighbourhood Office building.  She was badly injured (cranio-cerebral
      injury and fractures of both legs, grade 1 permanent disability).  She
      died  eight  months  later,  and  her  husband  was  joined  into  the
      proceedings in her stead.

      The first instance  court  had  awarded  the  widower  RMB  263406  in
      damages, together with RMB 180 per month for  three  persons  formerly
      supported by the couple, and costs of RMB  17510.   The  Neighbourhood
      Office appealed, arguing that its actions were lawful and there was no
      direct causal link between its actions and Mrs Yin falling out of  the
      window, becoming disabled and dying.  The widower appeared in  person,
      seeking payment of his  wife's  funeral  expenses  and  the  costs  of
      educating her two daughters. The court considered that the authorities
      in Xishan were 70% rather than 100% responsible.  They set  aside  the
      original decision, found that the Xishan Office had acted  unlawfully,
      gave credit for the sums  already  paid  and  the  adjusted  level  of
      responsibility, and ordered the office to pay RMB 163,675  within  one
      month.  The claimant's claims for funeral and education expenses  were
      rejected.

      The cases which apply the present scheme were as follows:

      In Wang Jun v People's Government of Qiangbai  Township,  Dali  County
      (People's Court of  Qiangbai  Township,  Dali  County,  Administrative
      Judgment (2004) Li Xing Chu No. 002, the claimant  husband,  Mr  Wang,
      had been married twice.  He had a child with his first wife, from whom
      he was divorced.  He remarried, and went on to have two children  with
      his second wife, four years apart.  The Dali  County  Family  Planning
      Bureau fined him for unauthorised birth of his second child  with  his
      second wife.   He paid RMB 6000 of an RMB 8000 fine.

      A year later, the Qiangbai Township Government purported to levy  SUC,
      this time of RMB 18000, for the same child.   They  issued  a  seizure
      notice and seized 36 rolls  of  cloth  and  17  bed  sheets  from  the
      claimant's shop.  He applied to the People's Court to  set  aside  the
      SUC, for the return of his goods and for damages.  During the hearing,
      a settlement was reached whereby the seized goods were returned  'with
      the exception of ten or so bed sheets'. The claimant was successful in
      his civil claim that imposition of SUC for his second child  with  his
      second wife included an  element  of  unlawful  double  imposition  in
      respect of the fine he had already paid  to  the  Dali  County  Family
      Planning Bureau for the same child. The  People's  Court  quashed  the
      first instance decision and ordered restitution and costs.

      In HUAI Yonghong and others v Family Planning  Bureau  of  the  Shilin
      Yizu Autonomous County, Hunnan Province (People's Court of Shilin Yizu
      Autonomous County, Yunnan, Administrative Judgment (2004) Shi Xing Chu
      No. 2), Mr Huai and his wife  were  both  unemployed  and  on  minimum
      benefits.  They had paid a fine  for  unlawful  pregnancy  before  the
      coming into force of the new statutory r�gime.  The child who was  the
      subject of  the  unlawful  pregnancy  was  born,  very  soon  after  1
      September  2002  when  the  national  r�gime  came  into  force.   The
      appellant's local authority imposed a fine for the birth of the child,
      disregarding the unlawful pregnancy fine for the same child in  utero,
      of which RMB 9000 had already been paid.  The fine was huge:   maximum
      SUC (10 x average local income) and no adjustment was made for the low
      income of the parties.  The People's Court quashed the SUC imposed and
      required the local authority to remake the decision, having regard  to
      the earlier pregnancy fine and the couple's financial position.

      The local authority appealed.  The Court's reasoning noted the  change
      from local  implementation  of  family  planning  Regulations  to  the
      overarching national Legislation Law of 2000, under which  the  Family
      Planning Law and Regulations were made and implemented.  The  national
      statutory scheme was designed to bring the responsibility  to  control
      fertility to public attention, and to regulate it.

        "1.      ... In the 1980s family planning underwent a  change  from
        "punishing too many births" to "charging  for  births  outside  the
        plan" and the Population and Family Planning Law  of  the  People's
        Republic of China passed on 29 December  2001  explicitly  provided
        for "social upbringing charges", which was the same  in  nature  as
        earlier charges though different in name.

        In this case the Claimants gave birth unlawfully  on  15  September
        2002, that is, the unlawful act occurred after [the  implementation
        of SUC]. The Claimants had been charged for an  unlawful  pregnancy
        before the new legislation was implemented;  but  after  they  were
        implemented what law should be applied when making a  levy  against
        them? And how was the amount of the  levy  to  be  determined?  And
        should the earlier levy be deducted?... [We find that]  the  charge
        for an unauthorised birth first levied  by  the  Respondent  is  in
        essence the same  as  the  Social  Upbringing  Charges  and  should
        therefore have been deducted from the Social Upbringing Charges.

        2.... In essence, the Respondent's failure to determine the  amount
        of  the  levy  in  accordance  with  the  levy  principles  in  the
        administrative rules promulgated by the State Council was a  breach
        of the law,  and  the  Respondent's  specific  administrative  acts
        should be seen as unlawful, and  this  should  not  be  seen  as  a
        question of the reasonableness of lawful administrative acts on the
        part of the Respondent. For these reasons the  judgment  cancelling
        the Respondent's specific  administrative  act  and  requiring  the
        Respondent to make another specific administrative act is correct.

        In administrative law there is no clear specific  boundary  between
        reasonableness and  lawfulness,  and  severe  unreasonableness  may
        amount to unlawfulness. But it can be seen from the  principles  in
        the  Administrative  Proceedings  Law  regarding  People's  Courts'
        investigations of the lawfulness of  specific  administrative  acts
        that  People's  Courts  have  no  right   to   enquire   into   the
        reasonableness of such acts. Therefore how judges  hearing  a  case
        decide whether a defect in an administrative act is one of  law  or
        one or reasonableness has become a key question in their judgments.
        In this case the judges dealing with it have applied the principles
        laid down by the  law  and  their  making  a  judgment  as  to  the
        lawfulness of the Respondent's specific legal acts may be seen as a
        courageous attempt."

      The decision by the lower court to  remit  the  second  SUC  levy  for
      decision afresh was upheld.

      In WANG Jiasheng v People's Government of Zhengping Township,  Xinfeng
      County,   (Intermediate   People's   Court   of   Ganzhou,    Jiangxi,
      Administrative Judgment (2006) Gan Zhong Xing Zhong No. 17),  Mr  Wang
      appealed against the level of administrative compensation  awarded  to
      him for being publicly accused of breaching family planning  rules  in
      relation to a recent birth, which in fact  was  not  an  out  of  plan
      birth.  Eight of the respondent's employees  went  to  the  claimant's
      house, where he explained that there  was  no  breach  of  the  family
      planning rules, but 'tempers rose on both sides'.  The claimant picked
      up a knife and threatened the officials, who responded by beating him.
      The claimant received soft tissue injuries in a number  of  places  on
      his body which were described as 'slight injuries grade 1'.  He needed
      hospital and outpatient treatment.  The Xinfeng Population and  Family
      Planning Committee published a circular criticising the officials  and
      pointing out that beating  citizens  was  unlawful.   Negotiations  on
      compensation failed due to  a  'comparatively  great  dispute'  as  to
      quantum.  The matter went to court.

      The court of first instance awarded the claimant loss  of  income  and
      primary treatment costs, but nothing  for  emotional  damage,  nursing
      fees, transport to hospital and additional food  costs  which  he  had
      claimed.  The claimant appealed.  The appellate court established  the
      appropriate level of transport and nutrition costs, and awarded costs.
       They rejected the claims for emotional damage and nursing fees.

      In People's Government of Chongxing Rural District,  Fengdu  County  v
      ZHANG  Guoliang  (People's  Third   Intermediate   Court,   Chongqing,
      Administrative Judgment (2006) Yu San Zhong Xing  Zhong  No.  46),  Mr
      Zhang and his wife Mrs Xiang had an out of plan second child,  a  son.
      The officials who attended his home  to  'carry  out  family  planning
      work' consisted of four or more Chongxing Government  employees,  four
      Village Committee officials, and the leader  of  his  workplace  team.
      The appellant, his wife, and their two children  were  not  home  when
      these nine or so officials arrived.  They lit a fire to keep warm, and
      put some rice on to boil.   It  was  late  December  2005.   When  the
      appellant came home, he was understandably upset to find at least nine
      assorted officials in his home,  burning  a  fire  and  boiling  rice.
      There was a scuffle in which he kicked one of  the  officials  on  the
      leg, causing slight injuries.  The official was taken to hospital  and
      a Deputy Secretary of  the  Chongxing  Township  Party  Committee  was
      called upon.  The following paragraphs from the judgment explain  what
      happened next:

        "... it was decided to take away 615 kg of grain, 10 pigs, 1  large
        table, 16 stools, a rice thresher and a pulveriser by force.  Later
        Zhang GL bought the rice thresher and pulveriser back for 100  Yuan
        and the other property was sold for 2,259 Yuan."

      The reason given for such extensive seizure was  to  pay  the  medical
      expenses of the injured official.

      Mr Zhang took  the  local  officials  to  court  for  restitution  and
      damages.  The  first  instance  court  found  for  the  claimant;  the
      Chongxing Government appealed, arguing that the officials were  acting
      in the pursuance of their family planning work duties.  On appeal, the
      court found that:

        "...The Chongxing Government should have complied strictly with the
        law and behaved in a civilised manner in the performance  of  their
        work and should not have infringed the lawful rights and  interests
        of a citizen. In this case the actions of the Chongxing Government,
        on the grounds that Zhang GL's son  was  a  second  child  born  in
        breach of family planning rules, in organising personnel to  go  to
        the home of Zhang GL and Xiang DH to carry out family planning work
        but on arrival lighting a fire, without authority, to keep warm and
        boiling some rice, and then taking assets by force from the home of
        Zhang GL and Xiang DH had no basis in law; they were  an  abuse  of
        authority, and such actions were an infringement  upon  the  lawful
        rights and interests of Zhang GL and Xiang DH; the judgment of  the
        court of  first  instance  and  the  law  the  court  applied  were
        correct."

      The original judgment of the first instance court was upheld  and  the
      Chongxing government was ordered to pay costs for both hearings.
