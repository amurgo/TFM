For the Appellant:     Mr D Katani, of Katani & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Malaysia, born on 3 December  1991.   The
    respondent refused his asylum and human rights claim  for  reasons  set
    out in a letter dated 7 March 2019.

 2. A panel of the FtT comprising Designated Judge  Murray  and  Judge  Rea
    dismissed the appellant's appeal by a decision promulgated  on  17  May
    2019.

 3. The appellant's grounds of  appeal  to  the  UT  are  attached  to  his
    application  for  permission  dated  31  May  2019.   The  FtT  granted
    permission on 17 June 2019.

 4. Ground 1 says that  the  FtT  misunderstood  the  significance  of  the
    finding  under  the  "National  Referral  Mechanism"  (NRM)  that   the
    appellant was a victim of  trafficking,  and  the  appellant  has  been
    "prejudiced" as a result.

 5. Ground 2 is that the FtT made contradictory findings at [23  &  24  c],
    and that [24 c] is irrelevant to risk on return.

 6. Ground 3 says that at [24] the FtT (a) did not  consider,  or  did  not
    adequately consider, the reasonableness of relocation within  Malaysia,
    and (b) erred by saying the appellant had not sought assistance of  the
    police in Malaysia, when he had said at Q/A 130 - 131 of his  interview
    that he did.

 7. Ground 4 says that  in  assessing  insurmountable  obstacles,  the  FtT
    failed to take into account that the appellant had been assessed  as  a
    victim of human trafficking, and made no finding on whether  "being  in
    witness protection" would be an insurmountable obstacle to family life.

 8. Having heard submissions from both parties, I reserved my decision.

 9. Ground 1 is rather vague about the significance which should have  been
    attached to the NRM finding, how that demonstrates error  by  the  FtT,
    and how that impacted on the outcome of  the  appeal.   Explaining  the
    ground further, Mr Katani said that the SSHD, through the NRM, accepted
    that the appellant was a victim of trafficking.  That was tested on the
    balance of probability, a higher standard than applies to a  protection
    claim.  He said that it was therefore inconsistent for  the  respondent
    to issue a decision on the protection claim declining  to  accept  that
    the appellant had a genuine  and  well-founded  fear  of  loan  sharks.
    Both decisions drew on the same interview and other  evidence,  and  so
    could not rationally come  to  different  conclusions  on  credibility.
    The matter had been raised as a "preliminary issue" in the FtT, in  the
    hope of obtaining a concession on credibility from the respondent.   On
    such a concession, the case would have turned only  on  sufficiency  of
    protection and internal relocation.

10. I asked why no copy of the NRM decision was before the FtT.  It appears
    that the respondent does not, as a matter of policy, file copies of NRM
    decisions in subsequent appeals.   The appellant  might  have  filed  a
    copy, but did not.  Parties agreed that nothing turned on its  absence,
    because all that such decisions say is that it has been  accepted  that
    the party was a victim of  trafficking,  with  no  further  details  or
    analysis.

11. The respondent's decision of 7 March  2019  says  at  [44],  "Your  NRM
    decision was made on 17 May 2018 and it was concluded that  you  are  a
    victim of human trafficking.  Your status as a  victim  is,  therefore,
    assessed in a separate decision under the  NRM  process,  whereas  this
    letter considers whether you need international protection".


12. After analysing the appellant's account in some  detail,  the  decision
    says at [63], "You have not been able to say who  borrowed  the  money,
    how much money was borrowed, the name of the man who made you work, the
    name of the woman you worked with or  the  location  of  the  caf�  you
    worked at.  Furthermore, the account you  gave  the  police  about  the
    police not being interested in the  loan  shark  is  inconsistent  with
    external evidence."

13. The decision continues at [64], "In light of all the evidence above  it
    is not accepted that you have a genuine and well-founded fear of a loan
    shark".

14. While the submissions for the appellant focused on  those  passages,  I
    note also that under  the  heading  "assessment  of  future  fear"  the
    respondent at [81] found "no genuine subjective fear" and at [81] found
    that any fear was "not objectively well founded".

15. The decisions of the  respondent  and  of  the  FtT  need  to  be  read
    carefully  and  in  detail,  but  once  that  is  done,  there  is   no
    inconsistency.

16. The respondent and the FtT accepted that in Malaysia in 2007,  when  he
    was aged 15, the appellant was forced by a loan shark to work in a caf�
    over debts owed by his father, brother and sister - which  amounted  to
    trafficking.

17. Nothing in their decisions departs from that.

18. It did not follow from accepting that past state of  affairs  that  the
    appellant on return to Malaysia in 2019 would be at risk  from  a  loan
    shark.

19. The FtT at [23] explained the extent to which the  appellant's  account
    was credible, which included being a victim of  trafficking.   At  [24]
    the FtT went on to the question whether there was "a real risk that the
    persecution or ill treatment he has suffered will be  repeated  in  the
    event of his return ...".

20. The FtT was plainly entitled to find that  the  evidence  disclosed  no
    such risk.  The reasons given are plainly sensible.

21. Everything else in the case is incidental.

22. Ground 2 turns  on  the  same  oversimplified  view  of  the  decisions
    separately reached on past trafficking and on further risk.  There  is,
    for the reasons above, no contradiction between [23] and [24 c].

23. As to ground 3 (a), the case did not turn on relocation, but on absence
    of risk.

24. Ground 3 (b) does show an error or oversight at [24  e].   By  his  own
    account, the appellant and his family made more than one  complaint  to
    the police.  The FtT gives no reason for taking those efforts not to be
    serious.  However, nothing turns on that.


25.  Absent  a  finding  of  risk,  there  was  no  evidence  which   might
    realistically have reached the high test of insurmountable obstacles to
    family life (ground 4).

26. The grounds do not show that the making of  the  decision  of  the  FtT
    involved the making of any error on a point of law, such that it  ought
    to be set aside.  That decision shall stand.

27. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
