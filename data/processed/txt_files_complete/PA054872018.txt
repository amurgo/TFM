                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     No Appearance.
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant in this case is the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department. However, for the sake of clarity, I shall use the titles by
    which the parties were known before the First-tier  Tribunal  with  the
    Secretary of State referred to as "the Respondent" and Mr S C P as "the
    Appellant".

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe  who  made  an  application  for
    international protection. That application was refused and he appealed.
    Following a hearing in Bradford, and in a decision  promulgated  on  25
    March 2019, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Ince allowed the appeal on
    both asylum and human rights grounds.

 3. The Respondent sought permission to appeal. It was granted by Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Wilson in a decision dated 17 April  2019.  The
    reasons for that decision were: -

         "1.  The grounds seek permission (in time) to appeal a decision and
         reasons of First-tier Tribunal Judge Ince who  in  a  decision  and
         reasons promulgated on 25 March 2019 both allowed and dismissed the
         Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision to refuse  his
         application for asylum

         2.   The grounds assert that  despite  rejecting  in  totality  the
         Appellant's claim [32-36] the judge in his "summary  of  decisions"
         allows the Asylum and Human Rights Appeals.

         3.   In an otherwise considered and careful decision the judge  has
         included contradictory statements  as  to  whether  the  appeal  is
         allowed or dismissed. This is an arguable material error of law

         4.   As this arguable material error of law  has  been  identified,
         all the grounds are arguable."

 4. Thus, the appeal came before me today.

 5. The Appellant did not appear at today's hearing. Indeed,  I  note  from
    paragraph 2 of the Judge's decision that there was also  no  appearance
    at the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.

 6. I am satisfied that the Appellant was served with notice of hearing  at
    his last address provided to the Tribunal.  Pursuant  to  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and in particular the  overriding
    objective within rule 2, I decided  to  proceed  to  hear  this  appeal
    today.

 7. Mr Mills relied upon the  grounds  seeking  permission  to  appeal.  In
    particular that despite  Judge  Ince  rejecting  the  totality  of  the
    Appellant's claim the appeal was erroneously allowed.

 8. I find that to be the position. Throughout his decision Judge Ince  has
    given cogent reasons for  his  adverse  credibility  findings  and  the
    rejection of the Appellant's claim.

 9. It is plain that in allowing the appeal in the final paragraph  of  his
    decision he has made an inadvertent error. This amounts to  a  material
    error of law.

Conclusions

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I remake the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
