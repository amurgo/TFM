                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr M Haque, Kalam Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The respondent is a citizen of Bangladesh and her date of  birth  is  5
    March 1991.  I shall refer to the respondent as the appellant  as  she
    was before the First-tier Tribunal.

2.   The appellant made an application in July 2013 for entry  clearance  as
    e the partner of Mr Minaj Uddin,  the  sponsor.   Her  application  was
    refused by the ECO Dhaka in a decision of  24  September  2013  on  the
    basis that the appellant is  unable  to  satisfy  the  substantive  and
    evidential requirements of Appendix FM. The appellant  has  to  provide
    specific evidence in  accordance  with  FM-SE  to  establish  that  the
    sponsor earns at least �18,600 per annum. The appellant's case is  that
    the sponsor has two jobs. He is employed as a support worker for  Susan
    Bush and his salary for the year ending April 2013 was �16,672.  He  is
    also employed by Boxmore Catering Limited on a part-time basis and from
    this employment he earns �50 per week which he receives in cash.

3.       According to the ECO the sponsor submitted his  P60  for  2012/2013
    but the information contained  therein  did  not  correspond  with  the
    records held by HMRC.  In addition the sponsor did not provide a letter
    from  Boxmore  Catering  Services  confirming  his  salary  and   other
    information required under the Rules.  In addition the bank  statements
    that he submitted with his  application  do  not  correspond  with  the
    sponsor's stated salary during the relevant period.

4.   The appellant appealed against the decision of the ECO and  her  appeal
    was allowed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Metzer in a decision of
    12 November 2014 following a hearing at  Taylor  House  on  30  October
    2014.  Permission to appeal against the decision of  Judge  Metzer  was
    granted  to  the  Secretary  of  State  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Robertson in a decision of 7 January 2015.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

5.   The Judge made the following findings:-

         "14.     I was impressed by  the  sponsor  who  I  found  to  be  a
             credible witness.  I accept that the appellant and the sponsor
             are  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship.   That  is
             evidenced by the documentary evidence of their relationship as
             well as the fact that he visited her in 2014.  I  also  accept
             that the appellant delayed making the  application  until  the
             sponsor could meet the criteria  in  terms  of  the  financial
             requirement.


         15.      In respect of the financial evidence, the  P60s  from  the
             appellant, including from his  second  employment  at  Boxmore
             Catering demonstrate clearly that the sponsor has the relevant
             income  for  the  relevant  six  month  period  prior  to  the
             application and in all the circumstances, I find the appellant
             has had no difficulty in establishing to the relevant standard
             that all of the requirements under Appendix FM are satisfied".



The Grounds of Appeal

6.   The grounds of appeal argue that the appellant was not able to  satisfy
    the mandatory requirements of Appendix FM-SE.  The bank statements that
    had been submitted did not show payments from Boxmore Catering  Limited
    going into  the  account  and  the  income  from  Susan  Bush  was  not
    sufficient to meet the requirement of the Rules.   All  money  received
    from employment must be paid directly into  the  bank  and  this  is  a
    mandatory requirement.

7.   I heard oral submissions from both parties. It was  very  disappointing
    that neither party seemed to have an  adequate  understanding  of  what
    evidence was before the  ECO  or  the  FtT.  In  any  event  Mr  Nath's
    submissions were in the context of the grounds of appeal and Mr Haque's
    submissions were made in the context of a skeleton  argument  submitted
    with the covering letter from the solicitors of 29 January 2015.


The Relevant Rules


8.    The relevant parts of Appendix FM-SE read as follows

         "Evidence of Financial Requirements under Appendix FM

                  counted as income under  this  Appendix,  subject  to  the
                  relevant evidential requirements of this Appendix."

          "2.     In respect of salaried employment in the UK [(except where
             paragraph 9 applies)], all of the following evidence  must  be
             provided:

                      their current employer for at least six  months  (and
                      where paragraph  13(b)  of  this  Appendix  does  not
                      apply); or


                  (ii) any period of salaried employment in  the  period  of
                      twelve months prior to the date of application if the

                      for less than six months (or at least six months  but
                      the person does not rely on paragraph 13(a)  of  this
                      Appendix), or in the financial year(s) relied upon by
                      a self-employed person.


             (b)  A letter from the employer(s) who issued the [pay  slips]

                      and


                  (iv)  the  type  of  employment  (permanent,  fixed   term

                  that the salary has been paid into an account in the  name
                  of the person or in the  name  of  the  person  and  their
                  partner jointly.


             ...


         Family Members - Specified Evidence


         ...


         D.   (a) In deciding an  application  in  relation  to  which  this
                  Appendix states that specified documents must be provided,
                  the Entry Clearance Officer or Secretary  of  State  ("the
                  decision maker") will consider documents  that  have  been
                  submitted with the application,  and  will  only  consider
                  documents submitted after the date  of  application  where
                  sub-paragraph (b) or (e) applies.


             (b)  If the applicant:


                  (i)  Has submitted:


                      (aa) a sequence of bank statements and  some  of  the
                           documents in the sequence have been omitted (e.g.
                           if one bank statement from a series is missing);


                      (bb) a document in the wrong format [(for example, if
                           a  letter  is  not  on  letter-headed  paper   as
                           specified)]; or


                      (cc) a document that is a copy and  not  an  original
                           document; or


                      (dd) a document which does not  contain  all  of  the
                           specified information; or


                  (ii) has not submitted a specified document,


                  the decision  maker  may  contact  the  applicant  or  his
                  representative in writing or otherwise,  and  request  the
                  document(s)  or  the  correct  version(s).   The  material
                  requested must be received ... at the address specified in
                  the request within a reasonable timescale specified in the
                  request.


             (c)  The decision maker will not request documents where he or
                  she does not  anticipate  that  addressing  the  error  or
                  omission referred to in sub-paragraph (b) will lead  to  a
                  grant because the application will be  refused  for  other
                  reasons.


             (d)  If the applicant has submitted:


                  (i)  a document in the wrong format; or


                  (ii) a document  that  is  a  copy  and  not  an  original
                      document, or


                  (iii)    a document that  does  not  contain  all  of  the
                      specified information, but the missing information is
                      verifiable from:


                      (1)  other documents submitted with the application,


                      (2)  the website of the organisation which issued the
                           document, or
                      (3)  the website of the appropriate regulatory body,


                  the application may be  granted  exceptionally,  providing
                  the decision maker is satisfied that  the  document(s)  is
                  genuine and that the applicant meets  the  requirement  to
                  which the document relates.  The  decision-maker  reserves
                  the right to request the specified original document(s) in
                  the correct format in all cases  where  sub-paragraph  (b)
                  applies, and to refuse applications if  this  material  is
                  not provided as set out in sub-paragraph (b).


             (e)  Where the decision maker is satisfied  that  there  is  a
                  valid  reason  why  a  specified  document(s)  cannot   be
                  supplied, e.g. because it is not issued  in  a  particular
                  country or has  been  permanently  lost,  he  or  she  may
                  exercise discretion not to apply the requirement  for  the
                  document(s)  or  to  request  alternative  or   additional
                  information or document(s) be submitted by the applicant.


             (f)  Before making  a  decision  under  Appendix  FM  or  this
                  Appendix, the decision maker may contact the applicant  or
                  their representative in writing or  otherwise  to  request
                  further information or documents.  The material  requested
                  must be received ...  at  the  address  specified  in  the
                  request within a reasonable  timescale  specified  in  the
                  request."



Error of Law

9.   The appellant could not meet the requirement of the rules for a  number
    of reasons. The  most  obvious  reason  is  that  the  bank  statements
    produced by the appellant did not show his salary from Boxmore Catering
    Limited going into his account. He submitted payslips and his  evidence
    is that he is paid in cash.  He referred  to  cash  deposits  into  the
    account which reflected this income, but it was conceded by Mr Haque at
    the hearing before me that the deposits do not reflect the  information
    on the payslips. Thus for this reason only the  appellant  cannot  meet
    the requirement of the rules. In  addition  there  was  a  letter  from
    Boxmore Catering Limited before the FtT but it does not comply with the
    requirement of the rules. It does not appear  that  the  appellant  has
    ever produced a letter in relation to Susan Bush  which  satisfies  the
    requirements of the rules. There was additional evidence before the FtT
    which was not before the ECO (wage slips from Boxmore Catering  Limited
    and bank statement which showed  some  deposits  corresponding  to  the
    payslips in relation to Susan Bush). The application had been  improved
    upon but still fell short of meeting the requirement of the rules.

10.  The Judge made a material error of law.  It was  not  open  to  him  to
    allow the appeal under the Rules.  I set aside the  decision  to  allow
    the appeal under the Rules. I  remake  the  decision  and  dismiss  the
    appeal under the Rules.

11.  Mr Haque in submissions advanced an argument that was  not  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  He drew my attention to  Appendix  FM-SE  A1  (m)
    (above).  This does not assist the appellant because she is not able to
    meet the relevant evidential requirement of the rules for  the  reasons
    identified.

12.  Mr Haque also relied on evidential flexibility  contained  in  Appendix
    FM-SE at D.  However he was not able to explain to me  how  this  could
    assist the appellant. It was not explained  to  me  how  the  appellant
    could have rectified the problem in relation  to  his  employment  with
    Boxmore Catering Limited. In addition there were other reasons why  the
    application failed to meet the  rules  and  therefore  the  application
    would have been refused for other reasons even  if  the  appellant  had
    been able to rectify  the  problem  in  relation  to  Boxmore  Catering
    Limited.

13.  Finally Mr Haque submitted that the  Secretary  of  State  should  have
    invoked discretion under Appendix FM-SE.  However, the request had been
    made with the application by the appellant for the  decision  maker  to
    invoke  any  discretion  (Sultana  and  Others  (rules:  waiver/further
    inquiry; discretion) [2014] UKUT 00540.

14.  The sponsor was found by the FtT to  be  a  credible  witness  and  the
    relationship was found to be genuine  and  subsisting.  These  findings
    were not challenged by the secretary of state.  The  appellant  is  not
    able to meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  and  for  this
    reason her appeal must be dismissed under the rules.

15.  Article 8 was not raised by Mr Haque; however, it  was  raised  in  the
    original grounds of appeal. It does not appear  that  it  was  expanded
    upon before the FtT or UT and as such it would be appropriate for me to
    consider that the ground has been abandoned. Nevertheless in  the  hope
    of bringing finality to these proceedings I will go  onto  to  consider
    Article 8. There is family life between the appellant and the  sponsor.
    In my view the issue is one of proportionality and I must consider  the
    circumstances at the  date  of  the  decision.   There  is  no  witness
    statement from the appellant and the evidence of the sponsor, contained
    in his witness statement of 23 October 2014, is that he  and  his  wife
    are distressed and anxious  as  a  result  of  the  refusal  for  entry
    clearance. The  evidence  in  relation  to  Article  8  is  lacking.  I
    understand that this decision will cause the appellant and the  sponsor
    more anxiety and uncertainty and this  is  unfortunate.   However,  the
    appellant submitted an application, through her  solicitors,  that  did
    not meet the requirement of the rules and  it  was  decided  to  appeal
    against this decision, when the requirements of the rules  could  still
    not be satisfied, instead of submitting another application. It may  be
    that the appellant has been poorly advised. A state  does  not  have  a
    general obligation to respect  an  immigrant's  choice  of  country  of
    residence.  I must consider Article 8 through the prism of section 117B
    of the 2002 Act.  The decision is in the public interest.  There was no
    evidence before me that that sponsor could not  relocate  to  Pakistan.
    The interference with the appellant's private life is justified

16.  I remake the decision and dismiss the appeal under the Rules and  under
    Article 8 of the 1950 Convention on Human Rights.

17.  No anonymity direction is made.
