Representation:
For the Appellant:       Mrs Mughal of  Pillai & Jones Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Savage, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant, Mrs Misira Khatun date of birth 19th November 1969, is a
    citizen of Bangladesh.  Having considered all the  circumstances  I  do
    not make an anonymity direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the determination of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Kanagaratnam promulgated  on  23rd  December  2014,
    whereby  the  judge  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  against   the
    decisions of the Respondent dated 23rd September 2014. The decisions by
    the Respondent were to refuse the Appellant further leave to remain  in
    the UK and to remove the Appellant from the UK.

 3. By decision made on the 12th February 2015 Judge C Andrew gave leave to
    appeal to the Upper  Tribunal.  The  case  now  appears  before  me  to
    determine in the first instance whether or not there is an error of law
    in the original determination.

 4. The first two grounds of appeal relate to whether the  Appellant  could
    rely upon  the  Immigration  Rules,  specifically  Appendix  FM.  Judge
    Kanagaratnam had ruled that, as the Appellant was a visitor at the time
    of making the  application,  she  was  excluded  from  relying  on  the
    provision of Appendix FM because  of  the  provisions  with  regard  to
    Immigration Status within the rules/Appendix FM.

 5. The relevant provisions of Appendix FM provide:-

         Immigration status requirements
         E-LTRP.2.1. The applicant must not be in the UK-
         (a) as a visitor;
         (b) with valid leave granted for a period of 6 months or less,
         unless that leave is
         as a fiancï¿½(e) or proposed civil partner;) or
         (c) on temporary admission


         E-LTRP.2.2. The applicant must not be in the UK in breach of
         immigration laws
         (disregarding any period of overstaying for a period of 28 days or
         less), unless paragraph EX.1. applies.

 6. Judge Kanagaratnam has referred to the provision in paragraph 7 of  the
    decision.

 7. The Appellant had entered the UK on the 11th August 2012 with leave  as
    a visitor valid until the 25th November 2012. On the 31st October  /1st
    November the Appellant had made application for further leave to remain
    in the UK as the spouse of a British national in the UK. At the time of
    the application the Appellant was a visitor and therefore in accordance
    with the extract from the rules set out could not rely on Appendix FM.

 8. Once the Appellant made an  application,  her  leave  would  have  been
    extended, in accordance with Section 3C of the  1971  Act.  That  would
    mean that the leave as a visitor would be extended until any appeal was
    finally determined. Whilst Judge Kanagaratnam has referred to the  fact
    that the Appellant  has  overstayed  the  period  of  leave  originally
    granted by the visa that does not alter the fact that the Appellant was
    a visitor at the time  of  making  the  application  and  therefore  is
    excluded under the provisions of the Rules identified from  relying  on
    Appendix FM.

 9. In the circumstances the first two grounds do not disclose any error of
    law.

10. Judge Andrews in granting leave has given leave also on the basis  that
    Judge Kanagaratnam has not taken account of all the evidence  that  was
    before  him,  particularly  the  medical  evidence  in  coming  to  the
    conclusion that the Appellant and her husband,   Mr  Jamshid  Ali,  can
    live in Bangladesh.

11. Mr Ali has been diagnosed with a number of ailments but these  ailments
    are  long  standing.  He  has  latent  sysphilis  diagnosed  in   1968,
    schizophrenia diagnosed in 1978, "squamous"cell carcinoma diagnosed  in
    July 2001 resulting in the amputation of the right leg in 2004. He  has
    diabetes also long standing [ in the letter from the  medical  practice
    page 16 there is reference to amputation of the foot/leg as a result of
    diabetes in 2004]. Mr Ali has "poor left leg hygiene" with  scaly  skin
    and marked onychogryphosis [nail distortion  and  thickening].  Mr  Ali
    also  appears  to  suffer  from   mental   problems   associated   with
    schizophrenia, athough he does not appear to be a danger to himself  or
    anyone else. For some years prior to 2010 Mr Ali was residing in the UK
    and being treated here.

12. There is no prognosis of the ailments indicating any  deterioration  in
    Mr Ali's condition. There is no evidence as to what  treatment  Mr  Ali
    was receiving in Bangladesh. There is no  statement  from  the  medical
    professionals that any of the conditions referred to required immediate
    intervention.  The  letters  from  the  medical   centres   relate   to
    acknowledging the conditions and setting up  appropriate  care  package
    for Mr Ali. There is no suggestion that any medical  care  received  in
    Bangladesh was inadequate or lacking.

13. Whilst Article 8 outside the rules is raised it is the relationship  of
    the appellant to her husband,  Mr  Jamshid  Ali,  that  is  central  to
    Article 8 in the case.  No aspect of private life of the Appellant  has
    been raised. Issues arise in respect of the medical  condition  of  the
    Appellant's husband, Mr Jamshid Ali, and his needs  and  dependency  on
    the Appellant but it is not the private life of the Appellant herself.

14. The Appellant and her husband, who is  a  British  citizen,  had  lived
    together in  Bangladesh  for  three  years  immediately  prior  to  the
    Appellant coming to the UK. They own a house in Bangladesh. Up to  2010
    Mr Ali was in a "Care/Nursing" home  "Rosewood"  in  Bradford  but  the
    family took him out of the home and Mr Ali went  to  Bangladesh  to  be
    looked after by the Appellant. There appears to have been other  family
    members in Bangladesh. There is reference to  the  Appellant's  and  Mr
    Ali's son sending money to Bangladesh.

15. In the statements the reason that Mr Ali was brought back to the UK was
    given as :-

       Paragraph 14 Appellant's statement

       My son realised that his financial remittances  was  being  used  by
       family members hence why we decided to  come  and  live  in  the  UK
       permanently

       Paragraph 5 of the son's statement

       Other family members took advantage of the financial support

16. In the letter from Brunswick medical centre dated 17th August there  is
    also reference to the fact that "all his benefits were  being  used  by
    family members" and because of that Mr Ali was brought down  to  London
    by the son. Again there is no medical reason for moving Mr Ali.

17. It is clear that the decision was that the Appellant  and  her  husband
    were coming back to the UK permanently but an application for entry  on
    the legally correct basis was not made in  respect  of  the  Appellant.
    Despite Mr Ali having been in the UK for some years prior  to  2010  it
    appears that the Appellant was in Bangladesh and only came  to  the  UK
    for the first time in 2013 on the visit visa. As noted by the judge she
    was being brought to the UK to look after her husband,  who  was  being
    brought back to the UK because of the issue of finances.  There  is  no
    suggestion of a medical reason for bringing the husband back to the UK.



18. There are references in the statements to Mr Ali's  medical  conditions
    but no references to Mr Ali's health deteriorating or of there being  a
    requirement  of  medical  intervention.   Whilst   Mr   Ali's   medical
    conditions have been listed there is no evidence that treatment was not
    available in Bangladesh or that Mr Ali was not receiving  treatment  in
    Bangladesh. There is a list  of  his  ailments  but  no  evidence  that
    medical treatment would not be available  in  Bangladesh  albeit  at  a
    price.

19. There is nothing in the medical reports that indicate that Mr  Ali  was
    not receiving medical  treatment  in  Bangladesh  and  could  not  have
    continued to do so. The reason given  for  the  Appellant  and  Mr  Ali
    coming to the UK is that other  family  members  appear  to  have  been
    misusing the money sent to support  them  in  Bangladesh,  not  medical
    reasons.

20.  Accordingly  the  evidence  disclosed  that  the  son  had  taken  the
    Appellant's husband out of a care home to send him to Bangladesh to  be
    looked after by the Appellant. When issues arose  with  regard  to  the
    money being used by other family members, it was decided to  bring  the
    Appellant and her husband back to  the  United  Kingdom,  in  the  full
    knowledge that the Appellant was coming to  live  permanently  to  look
    after her husband. No medical justification for that has been  set  out
    in the brief letters from the medical practitioners  dealing  with  the
    husband. No evidence has been adduced that the medical treatment  would
    not be available in Bangladesh at a price.

21. The judge clearly took account of the medical issues as is evident from
    paragraph 4 of  the  decision  but  there  was  no  evidence  that  the
    appellant's husband needed treatment in the UK that was  not  available
    in Bangladesh or that only the Appellant could provide such care.  Care
    had been provided in the past in a secure Care home environment but the
    family had decided to remove Mr Ali from that environment.

22. The family clearly circumvented the Immigration Rules by  bringing  the
    Appellant into the United Kingdom as a visitor when they knew  she  was
    coming to stay.

23. As is evident from what the judge says  he  did  consider  the  medical
    evidence and set out in paragraph 4. Circumstances otherwise would seem
    to indicate that the Appellant had lived all  her  life  in  Bangladesh
    whilst her husband had lived most of his life over  the  years  in  the
    United Kingdom separated from his wife. The Appellant and  her  husband
    had lived in Bangladesh for three years and the  only  issue  was  with
    regard to family members misusing the money sent to support them. There
    is no suggestion that the circumstances in Bangladesh were not adequate
    or that Mr Ali's medical condition  was  not  being  adequately  looked
    after.

24. In light of the evidence the judge was entitled to  conclude  that  the
    Appellant and her husband could live in Bangladesh. There  was  nothing
    on the medical  evidence  that  indicated  that  that  compromised  the
    medical conditions of Mr  Ali.  In  the  circumstances  the  judge  was
    entitled to conclude that the decision appealed against did not  breach
    the Article 8 rights of the Appellant or her husband.

25. In light of  all  the  factors  there  is  no  material  error  in  the
    determination of the judge.

26. Even if there were an error of law in the determination  by  the  judge
    taking account of all the evidence presented I would in any event  have
    found that the decision to  remove  the  appellant  is  proportionately
    justified.

27. Whilst Mr Ali does have medical conditions there is  no  evidence  that
    they could not be treated in Bangladesh. The Appellant and Mr  Ali  had
    lived for three years in Bangladesh and the only  reason  for  bringing
    them back to the United Kingdom was financial, that is  family  members
    were misusing the money sent. There is no reason why appropriate  steps
    could not be taken to  ensure  that  the  money  sent  to  support  the
    Appellant and Mr Ali is applied properly. The Appellant and Mr Ali have
    a house in Bangladesh, which they could occupy.

28. If Mr Ali wants to remain in the UK to receive medical treatment, there
    is nothing to indicate that  he  requires  the  personal  care  of  the
    Appellant. If they want the Appellant to live with Mr Ali in the United
    Kingdom there is no reason why she could not make  an  application  and
    seek to comply with the rules.

29. Thus even if there were an error of law taking  all  the  circumstances
    into account I am satisfied that the decision would in  any  event  had
    been proportionately justified.

30. There is a no material error of law in the determination.  I uphold the
    decision to dismiss this appeal on all grounds.
