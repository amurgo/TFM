                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a determination
        First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Tully  promulgated  on  7  July  2014,
        following a hearing at Stoke, in  which  the  Judge  dismissed  the
        appeals of this family unit under the Immigration Rules but allowed
        them on human rights grounds. The reference  to  'Appellant(s)  and
        Respondent' shall be to the status of the parties before the First-
        tier Tribunal.


     2. The Appellants are a family unit composed of a father born on  18th
        February 1966, his wife born on 22nd February 1972 and three  minor
        children aged 15, 11, and 4 at the date of the hearing  before  the
        First-tier Tribunal.


     3. The immigration history shows that the First Appellant entered  the
        United Kingdom lawfully as a student in September 2005. Such  leave
        was extended to November 2010 followed by a period of  leave  as  a
        Tier 2 (General) Migrant to 7 October 2013.  The  Second  Appellant
        entered the United Kingdom as a dependent spouse with the Third and
        Fourth Appellants in February 2006. The Fifth Appellant was born in
        the United Kingdom in April 2010. All are citizens of Nigeria.


     4. An application was made for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom
        on  the  basis  of  family  and  private  life  under  either   the
        Immigration Rules, Appendix FM, or outside the Rules under  Article
        8 ECHR. This application was rejected by  the  Secretary  of  State
        leading to the appeal before Judge Tully.


     5. The findings of fact  and  credibility  are  to  be  found  between
        paragraphs 18 to 23 of the determination.  It is  noted  that  very
        little of the evidence concerning the Appellant's circumstances was
        in dispute although a number of elements of the  Appellants'  cases
        were rejected and it found the First Appellant  in  particular  had
        sought to exaggerate his case to enhance the claim which  adversely
        affected his general credibility. The Judge  specifically  rejected
        the contention that the minor appellants  will  be  prevented  from
        being educated or that they will be adversely affected due to their
        lack of Igbo, as it was found they could attend an English speaking
        school as the two older children had previously whilst in  Nigeria.
        The Judge also rejected the assertion the First Appellant  and  his
        wife will have difficulty securing employment,  finding  that  they
        will be well placed to obtain employment  if  they  returned.   The
        First Appellant's reference to the dangers of living in Nigeria was
        rejected and it found that neither he  nor  his  family  will  face
        persecution on return and that, in any event, he not made an asylum
        claim. There was no evidence to  suggest  the  relationship  formed
        with relatives in the United Kingdom amounted to family life in the
        context of Article 8.


     6. In relation to the appeal under the Immigration  Rules:  the  Judge
        noted that the Appellants are in the United  Kingdom  legally,  had
        made a valid application and that there was no suggestion they  did
        not meet the suitability requirements when applying R-LTRP. It  was
        found, however, that for these provisions to apply  the  Appellants
        had to show they met all the eligibility requirements to  be  found
        in E-LTRP  or  alternatively  paragraphs  1.2  -1.12  and  2.1  and
        paragraph EX.1.  A key requirement in 1.2 is  the  requirement  for
        the First and Second Appellants  to  show  that  their  partner  is
        either a British citizen, present and settled,  or  a  person  with
        asylum or humanitarian protection, which applies to neither of  the
        adult appellants.  The inability of the First and Second Appellants
        to satisfy the eligibility requirements prevents  them  from  being
        able to benefit from paragraph EX.1.


     7. Paragraph 276 ADE relating to private life claims is not be met and
        the  three  minor  appellants  fail  under  Appendix  FM   as   the
        applications made by their parents did not succeed.


     8. The Judge correctly found that the Appellants' could not  meet  the
        requirements of the Immigration Rules and proceeded to consider the
        matter outside the Rules in relation to which a number of  findings
        were made which can be summarised as follows:


     i.   In this matter the appellant's cannot  benefit  from  Appendix  FM
          because they are a family unit all of whom  are  here  temporarily
   [31]


     ii.  The parties in the case  are  in  a  genuine  relationship  living
   together as             a couple and a family unit. All  five  appellants
   enjoy family life                together in the United Kingdom  although
   did not enjoy family life             with other family  members  in  the
   United Kingdom [34].


     iii. The family  enjoyed  private  life  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The
   question            in the appeal is one of proportionality [34].


     iv.  The first  appellant  has  been  in  United  Kingdom  since  2005,
     appellants 2, 3 and 4 since  2006.  They  have  been  law  abiding  and
   have  not  overstayed.  They  have  employment   that   they   would   be
   required to leave  if  removed.   Although  employment  is  available  in
   Nigeria they may  face  some  problems  in  their  working  lives  whilst
   they re-establish themselves [35].


     v.   The family will potentially lose contact with friends  in  the  UK
          although the appellants have always been here on a temporary basis
              and any friendships they have formed were made at a time  when
          they did not have leave to stay on a permanent basis and that they
              might have to leave if they had no basis on  which  to  extend
   their stay              [36].


     vi.  Appellants 1-4 were born in Nigeria. All  are  Nigerian  citizens.
   The            first and second appellants have maintained ties and  they
   have                parents and siblings living in Nigeria who  would  be
   supportive if           they returned. Although removal mean the loss  of
   society from                 extended family in the  United  Kingdom  the
   family  as  a  whole  would                benefit   from   living   near
   grandparents who remain in Nigeria [37].


     vii. In assessing what is in the  best  interests  of  children  it  is
   generally           accepted that the best interests of the children  are
   to stay within an            established family unit which would  not  be
   affected if the family           were returned  as  a  group  to  Nigeria
   [39].


     viii.    The fourth appellant came to the United Kingdom  when  he  was
     three years old and has lived here for over eight years of his life. He
              has little recollection of living in Nigeria. He is,  however,
   young          enough to adapt with the support of his family. He can  be
   educated            in a British speaking school and  his  lack  of  Igbo
   language will not be             a barrier to education. He is likely  to
   adapt particularly given that he              can undertake his education
   in English. In the first appellant's own           words, having  a  good
   understanding of English is important to               success in Nigeria
   [40].


     ix.  The primary  concern  is  the  impact  of  removal  on  the  third
   appellant.              She was seven years of age when she came  to  the
   United Kingdom               and  whilst  is  likely  to  have  a  better
   recollection of her childhood in              Nigeria, has spent nearly 8
   years of her life in the UK during which           time she  has  studied
   and  is  likely  to  have  formed  deeper   friendships               and
   associations than the younger children [41].


     x.   The third appellant is partway through her GCSEs. Removal at  this
          time would be likely to have a considerable impact on her. Even if
              allowed to remain for a short period to complete  examinations
   she            would be restarting school in Nigeria at a  very  advanced
   stage of her            education. It will be considerably harder for her
   to adapt in these            circumstances than the younger children. She
   could be educated in             English and no doubt  this  will  be  of
   assistance to her [42].


     xi.  The length of stay relevant for paragraph  EX.1  is  seven  years.
          Although this provision does not apply to the third appellant  she
   has            spent eight years in the United Kingdom at a critical time
   when she            was forming her  personality  and  social  links.  It
   would be unfair to           use a higher starting point when  assessment
   of the reasonableness  of               return  in  her  case  than  that
   envisaged in the Rules. Although the           parents  knew  they  might
   have to  return  this  was  not  the  third                   appellant's
   choice, it is not her fault she is in this position [43].


     xii. The role of the Human Rights Act is not to fill a  gap  where  the
          appellant was not able to meet the Immigration Rules for  whatever
          reason. There is a strong public interest argument in enforcing  a
   fair            and  transparent  immigration  policy.   The  Judge   was
   persuaded that               the impact on the third  appellant  is  such
   that it would  be                       unreasonable  to  expect  her  to
   return to Nigeria at this stage of her              education  and  life.
   Given that her family had been law abiding and              not  breached
   the Immigration Rules, that they are in employment               and  the
   other  factors  as  found,  the  decision  to  refuse  leave  was   found
   not be a proportionate breach to  the  right  to  private  life  for  the
     appellants [44].


     9. The Secretary of State was granted permission  to  appeal  on  25th
        July 2014 on the basis it was said to be arguable  that  the  Judge
        had failed to set out the exceptional circumstances justifying  her
        decision and that in considering the best interests of the children
        had arguably erred in law in placing too great an emphasis on their
        education and personal ties.



Discussion



    10. Having heard detailed submissions  from  the  advocates  the  Upper
        Tribunal found that the Judge had made a legal error although there
        was as issue as to whether that error was material. I  find  it  is
        and substitute a decision to dismiss the  appeal.  I  now  give  my
        reasons.


    11. The  finding  the  Appellants  are  unable  to  succeed  under  the
        Immigration Rules is not the subject of a  cross-appeal  and  shall
        therefore stand. It is, in any event, legally correct.


    12. The Judges decision is based upon a reliance on E-A  (Article  8  -
        best interests of  child)  Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT  00315  which  was
        decided  prior  to  the  amendments  to   the   Immigration   Rules
        incorporating the Secretary of State's  view  in  relation  to  how
        Article 8  issues  should  be  assessed  and  later  more  relevant
        decision of the Upper Tribunal and Senior Courts. In July 2012  new
        Immigration Rules were brought into force which  were  endorsed  by
        Parliament to give them democratic approval. There  has  been  much
        case law relating to this area. The question of how to proceed when
        Rules are not met has been in a state of  some  flux  although  the
        current thinking suggests that a full assessment outside the  Rules
        is required.


    13. The traditional general starting point for assessing and Article  8
        ECHR claim is the judgment in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27  in  which  the
        House of Lords set  out  five  steps  to  follow  when  determining
        Article 8 outside of the Rules:


          (i)     Does family life, private  life,  home  or  correspondence
   exist within the             meaning of Article 8


          (ii)    If so, has or will the right  to  respect  for  this  been
   interfered with.


              (iii)    If so, is the interference  in  accordance  with  the
   law.


              (iv)     If so, is the interference in pursuit of one  of  the
   legitimate aims set out in            Article 8(2); and


          (v)     If so, is the interference proportionate to the pursuit of
   the legitimate aim?


    14. Earlier post July 2012 case law, even if indicating there would  be
        no change in approach, supports the argument that the weight to  be
        attached to immigration control when the Rules  were  not  met  has
        increased.    A number of recent cases have  continued  to  provide
        guidance,  such  as  Ahmed  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
        Department [2014] EWHC 300 (Admin) in which the  appellant  entered
        as a spouse but then overstayed. He did not have a recognised  ESOL
        Skills for Life course. Mr Justice Green held that  application  of
        the  rules  and  guidance   ordinarily   meant   that   Article   8
        considerations had been catered  for:  R  (on  the  application  of
        Nagre) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720
        (Admin) applied. It  was  found  important  to  avoid  a  tick  box
        mentality when applying the exceptional circumstances policy. After
        working through the analysis required, it was  essential  to  stand
        back and formulate a view on whether overall there might be a  good
        arguable case of disproportionality if leave was  not  granted.  In
        the  instant  case,  no  good  arguable   grounds   were   advanced
        particularly as it was found that family  life  could  continue  in
        Pakistan and they were no British citizen children.


    15. In Meera Muhiadeen Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA  Civ  558  Lord  Justice
        Beatson confirmed that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  who  allowed
        the appeal erred in his approach to Article 8 because  he  did  not
        consider the case for remaining in the United Kingdom on the  basis
        of his private and family life against  the  Secretary  of  State's
        policy  as  contained  in  Appendix  FM  and  Rule  276ADE  of  the
        Immigration Rules. In order for  leave  to  remain  to  be  granted
        outside of the provisions of the Immigration Rules, there needed to
        be  compelling  or  exceptional  circumstances   not   sufficiently
        recognised under the new rules that outweighed the public  interest
        in deportation. In the instant case the First-tier Tribunal gave no
        explanation of why the  case  was  compelling  or  exceptional.  It
        identified no particular features which justified the consideration
        of proportionality outside the  rules.  The  declaration  that  the
        Immigration Rules worked  harshly  against  the  Claimant  did  not
        suffice. These new  provisions  in  the  Immigration  Rules  are  a
        central part of the legislative and policy  context  in  which  the
        interests of immigration control are balanced against the interests
        and rights of people who have come to  this  country  and  wish  to
        settle in it. Overall the Secretary of State's policy as to when an
        interference  with  an  Article  8  right  will  be   regarded   as
        disproportionate is more particularised in the new  Rules  than  it
        had previously been. The new Rules require stronger bonds with  the
        United Kingdom before leave will be given under them. The  features
        of the policy contained in the Rules include  the  requirements  of
        twenty year residence, that the applicant's partner  be  a  British
        citizen in the United Kingdom, settled here, or here with leave  as
        a refugee or humanitarian protection, and that where the  basis  of
        the application rests on the applicant's children  that  they  have
        been residents for seven years. Lord Justice Beatson also confirmed
        it necessary to find "compelling circumstances" for  going  outside
        the Rules. He confirmed that "the passages from  the  judgments  in
        the cases of Nagre and  MF  (Nigeria)  appear  to  give  the  Rules
        greater  weight  than  as  merely  a   starting   point   for   the
        consideration  of  the  proportionality  of  an  interference  with
        Article 8 rights". He did not consider that it is necessary to  use
        the  terms  "exceptional"   or   "compelling"   to   describe   the
        circumstances, and it will suffice if that can be said  to  be  the
        substance of the tribunal's decision.


    16. In MM(Lebanon) and others [2014] EWCA Civ 985 it was suggested that
        where a particular set of the immigration rules are not a  complete
        code, then the issue of proportionality under  Article  8  will  be
        more at large.  In  this  respect  in  R  (on  the  application  of
        Ganesabalan [2014] EWHC 2712 (Admin) it was held that unlike  other
        Rules  which  have  a  built-in  discretion  based  on  exceptional
        circumstances, Appendix FM and Rule  276ADE  are  not  a  "complete
        code" so far  as  Article  8  compatibility  is  concerned  because
        Appendix  FM  and  Rule  276ADE  have  no  equivalent  "exceptional
        circumstances" provision.


    17. In R (on the application of Ganesabalan it was held that:


          (i)     Unlike other Rules which have a built-in discretion  based
   on exceptional               circumstances, Appendix FM and  Rule  276ADE
   are not a "complete code"             so far as Article  8  compatibility
   is concerned. Appendix FM and Rule            276ADE have  no  equivalent
   "exceptional circumstances" provision.                 "Plainly", as  was
   held in Amin at paragraph 26, they are not "exhaustive";              but
   there is "always a residual  discretion"  (see  paragraph  42).   As  the
     Court of Appeal explained in MM (Lebanon) (paragraph 134): " ... if the
              relevant group of [Immigration Rules] is not ...  a  'complete
   code' then the               proportionality test will be more at  large,
   albeit guided by the Huang tests              and UK and Strasbourg  case
   law".  The Immigration Rules are the               important first  stage
   and the focus of Article 8 assessments. Indeed it  will                be
   an error of law not to address Article 8 by reference to the Rules.   The
          position is explained by the Court of Appeal  in  Halleemudeen  at
          paragraphs 40 to 42, 47 and 51.


          (ii)    The Immigration Rules operate alongside important guidance
   which is            itself part of the relevant overall  code  and  which
   guidance recognises the               discretion outside  the  Rules  and
   the duty  on  the  SSHD  to  consider                    exercising  that
   discretion  in  the  individual  case.  So  far  as  this  is  concerned,
   the relevant guidance for the purposes of  this  case  was  in  the  IDIs
      December  "Family  Members  Under  the  Immigration  Rules"  (December
   2012) at  paragraph  3.2.7d  headed  "Exceptional  circumstances".   This
   states              'Exceptional' does not mean  'unusual'  or  'unique'.
   Whilst all cases are to               some extent  unique,  those  unique
   factors do not generally render them          exceptional. For example, a
   case is not exceptional just because the criteria            set  out  in
   EX.1.  of  Appendix  FM   have   been   missed   by   a   small   margin.
   Instead, exceptional' means circumstances in which refusal  would  result
   in             unjustifiably harsh consequences for the  individual  such
   that refusal of the              application would not be  proportionate.
   That is likely to be the case only            very rarely. In determining
   whether there are exceptional circumstances,           the decision maker
   must consider all relevant factors.  The guidance               describes
   in  mandatory  terms  a  duty  to  consider  all  relevant   factors   in
   order to make  a  determination  as  to  whether  there  are  exceptional
     circumstances.  That follows from the phrase  "in  determining  whether
     there are exceptional circumstances, the decision maker  must  consider
   all            relevant factors". So far as exceptional circumstances are
   concerned, the               guidance makes clear that it  is  describing
   "circumstances in which refusal           would result  in  unjustifiably
   harsh consequences for the individual such             that  the  refusal
   of the application would not be proportionate". The court            held
   that it follows from the factual premise in this case and the analysis of
              the law that there was  an error of law because  the  decision
   letter and              notice contained no indication or reasoning which
   demonstrates that the            SSHD  had  considered  the  exercise  of
   discretion or the question of                  exceptional  circumstances
   or the question of proportionality.  In order to            be  a  lawful
   decision  the  SSHD  was  required   to   address   her   mind   to   the
   question of the discretion and was required in her reasons to demonstrate
              that she had done so and what conclusion she had reached.


    18. In R (on the application of Esther Ebun Oludoyi & Ors) v  Secretary
        of State for the Home Department (Article  8  -  MM  (Lebanon)  and
        Nagre) IJR [2014] UKUT 00539  (IAC)  it  was  held  that  there  is
        nothing in R (Nagre)  v  SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin),  Gulshan
        (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 640
        (IAC) or Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014]  UKUT  00085  (IAC)
        that suggests that a threshold test was being suggested as  opposed
        to making it clear that there was a need to look at the evidence to
        see if there was anything which has  not  already  been  adequately
        considered in the context of the Immigration Rules and which  could
        lead to a successful Article 8 claim. These authorities must not be
        read as seeking to qualify or fetter the assessment of  Article  8.
        This is consistent with para 128 of R (MM & Others) v  SSHD  [2014]
        EWCA Civ 985, that there  is  no  utility  in  imposing  a  further
        intermediate test as a preliminary to a consideration of an Article
        8 claim beyond the relevant criterion-based Rule. As is held  in  R
        (Ganesabalan) v SSHD [2014] EWHC 2712 (Admin), there  is  no  prior
        threshold which dictates whether the exercise of discretion  should
        be  considered;  rather  the  nature  of  the  assessment  and  the
        reasoning  which  are  called  for  are   informed   by   threshold
        considerations.


    19. The 'exceptionality' requirement  referred  to  in  cases  such  as
        Gulshan is also reflected in some ECHR decisions.   In  Jeunesse  v
        the  Netherlands  Application  12738/10  the   ECtHR   said   where
        confronted with a fait accompli the  removal  of  the  non-national
        family member by the authorities would be incompatible with Article
        8 only in exceptional circumstances. The Court  must  thus  examine
        whether  in  the  applicant's  case  there  are   any   exceptional
        circumstances  which  warrant  a  finding  that   the   Netherlands
        authorities  failed  to  strike  a  fair  balance  in  denying  the
        applicant residence in the Netherlands.


    20. The Judge clearly accepts  that  the  adult  Appellant's  cases  in
        isolation, and those of the Fourth and  Fifth  Appellants,  satisfy
        neither the Immigration Rules nor give rise to  circumstances  that
        make the decision disproportionate. The Judge's focus is  upon  the
        Third Appellant and makes findings relating  to  her  time  in  the
        United Kingdom, educational activities, and impact of removal.


    21. In E-A(Article 8 - best interests of child) the Tribunal held that:


              (i) The correct starting point in considering the welfare  and
   best                    interests of a young child would be that it is in
   the best interests of a                    child  to  live  with  and  be
   brought up by his or her  parents,  subject  to                 any  very
   strong  contra-indication.  Where  it  is  in  the  best   interests   of
   a child to live with and be brought up by his or her  parents,  then  the
          child's removal with his parents does not involve  any  separation
   of                  family life.


              (ii)     Absent other factors, the  reason  why  a  period  of
   substantial                       residence  as  a  child  may  become  a
   weighty consideration in the                       balance  of  competing
   considerations is that in the course of such time               roots are
   put   down,    personal    identities    are    developed,    friendships
   are  formed  and  links  are  made  with  the   community   outside   the
     family unit. The degree to which these elements  of  private  life  are
          forged and therefore the weight to be given to the passage of time
                  will depend upon the facts in each case.


              (iii)    During a child's very early years, he or she will  be
   primarily focused                 on  self  and  the  caring  parents  or
   guardian. Long residence once the                   child  is  likely  to
   have   formed   ties   outside   the   family   is   likely    to    have
   greater impact on his or her well being.


              (iv)     Those who have their  families  with  them  during  a
   period of study in               the UK must do so in the  light  of  the
   expectation of return.


              (v) The Supreme Court in ZH(Tanzania)[2011]  UKSC  4  was  not
   ruling                  that the ability of  a  young  child  to  readily
   adapt to life in  a  new                     country  was  an  irrelevant
   factor, rather that the adaptability of the                 child in each
   case    must    be    assessed    and     is     not     a     conclusive
   consideration on its own.


    22. The finding that it is necessary for the adaptability of the  child
        to be properly assessed does not appear on the facts to  have  been
        adequately considered by  the  Judge  in  the  determination  under
        challenge.


    23. The decision of the Judge is based upon the  extent  of  the  Third
        Appellant's integration into the United Kingdom and her  desire  to
        continue with her education in this country which can  be  inferred
        from the Judge's concerns relating to the ability of the  child  to
        maximise her potential in this respect elsewhere. Before the  Upper
        Tribunal the First Appellant confirmed that  his  daughter  had  in
        fact nearly completed her GCSE examinations  at  the  time  of  the
        appeal hearing, her last examination being taken in June/July 2014.
        The finding in paragraph 42 of the  determination  that  the  Third
        Appellant was "partway through her  GCSEs"  is  therefore  somewhat
        misleading as the Third Appellant was fact at the conclusion of her
        GCSE studies and examinations and at the point of a  natural  break
        in her education. The reference to a period being allowed to enable
        her to complete examinations indicates this must  be  an  issue  of
        which the Judge was aware.


    24. The First Appellant also stated that his daughter had commenced her
        A-level studies and wished to go on to university and qualified  as
        a doctor. The Judge indicates that it would be considerably  harder
        for the Third Appellant to adapt than  for  the  younger  children,
        although also accepts she could be educated in English in  Nigeria.
        The First Appellant indicated that for a person  to  qualify  as  a
        doctor in Nigeria it is important they are able to speak  Igbo  but
        this statement is not corroborated by any country  information  and
        it was found the First Appellant exaggerated  his  evidence  in  an
        attempt  to  enhance  the  claim  which  adversely   affected   his
        credibility. Even if there is a requirement to speak  both  English
        and Igbo the Third Appellant lived in Nigeria for a number of years
        and if she is capable of achieving the required academic levels  to
        qualify as a doctor, it has not been shown she is unable  to  learn
        this language. It has also not been  shown  on  the  evidence  that
        having to spend time learning the language, even if this  puts  her
        back  in  her  studies,  and  while  she  completed  the   Nigerian
        equivalent of A-levels would result in consequences detrimental  to
        her well-being.


    25. Miss Johnstone also referred to the assessment of the best interest
        of the children by reference to the case of EV (Philippines) [2014]
        EWCA Civ 874. At paragraphs 36 and 37 of their judgment  the  Court
        found:
              36. In a sense the tribunal is concerned with how emphatic  an
   answer falls to                  be given to the question: is it  in  the
   best interests of the child to  remain?                  The  longer  the
   child  has  been  here,  the  more  advanced  (or  critical)  the   stage
   of his education, the looser his ties with the country in  question,  and
   the                 more deleterious the consequences of his return,  the
   greater the weight that                   falls  into  one  side  of  the
   scales.   If   it    is    overwhelmingly    in    the    child's    best
   interests that he should not return, the  need  to  maintain  immigration
              control may well not tip the balance. By contrast if it is  in
   the child's best                 interests to remain, but only on balance
   (with some factors pointing the               other way), the result  may
   be the opposite.
              37. In the balance on the other side there falls to  be  taken
   into account the                 strong weight to be given to the need to
   maintain immigration control in                pursuit  of  the  economic
   well-being    of    the    country    and    the    fact     that,     ex
   hypothesi, the applicants have no entitlement to remain. The  immigration
              history of the parents may also be relevant e.g. if  they  are
   overstayers, or                  have acted deceitfully.
    26. In this appeal the children are not British and have  no  right  to
        remain in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  basis  of  their  status  is
        temporary with no legitimate expectation that permanent leave  will
        be granted. The children have been educated at the  public  expense
        during their time here but there is no obligation upon  the  United
        Kingdom to continue to fund or provide future education. It has not
        been shown on the available material presented  to  the  First-tier
        Tribunal that the Third Appellant  will  be  unable  to  reach  her
        potential in terms of her education in Nigeria.  The evidence  does
        not support a finding that it was overwhelmingly not in  the  Third
        Appellant's best interests to return with the rest of her family to
        Nigeria.


    27. The Judge at paragraph  43  also  refers  to  EX.1.  claiming  this
        provision applies when an individual has seven years  residence  in
        the United Kingdom which the Judge opines is the benchmark level of
        assessment. As the Third Appellant had been in the  United  Kingdom
        for eight years it was found to be unfair to use a higher  starting
        point for the assessment of the reasonableness of return than  that
        envisaged by the Rules.  If this is the case it is  incumbent  upon
        the Judge to accurately record  the  specific  provisions  of  EX.1
        which are:


              EX.1. This paragraph applies if
              (a)      (i)  the  applicant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
   parental relationship                 with a child who-


                       (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was under the
   age of 18                    years when the applicant was first granted
   leave on the basis                    that this paragraph applied;
                       (bb) is in the UK;
                       (cc) is a British Citizen or has lived in the UK
   continuously for                      at least the 7 years immediately
   preceding the date of                         application ;and
                  (ii) it would not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to
   leave the UK; or
               (b)       the  applicant  has  a   genuine   and   subsisting
   relationship with a                       partner who is in the UK and is
   a British Citizen, settled in the UK or                 in  the  UK  with
   refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and there                   are
   insurmountable   obstacles   to   family   life   with    that    partner
   continuing outside the UK.


    28. The assessment cannot be made based upon time alone in  the  United
        Kingdom as this provision is now  enshrined  within  the  Rules  in
        paragraph 276ADE,  requiring  20  years  residence.   The  loss  of
        connections with the individual's  home  state  is  a  factor  also
        included in the Rules at 296 ADE (vi). EX.1 requires an  assessment
        of both time in the UK, which must be continuously for at least the
        7 years immediately preceding the date of application, and a proper
        assessment of whether it would not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
        child  to  leave  the  UK.  This  requires  a  properly   conducted
        proportionality assessment to be undertaken.


    29. Miss Johnstone also referred to the case of Zoumbas v  SSHD  [2013]
        UKSC 74 which reviewed earlier  authorities  and  confirmed,  inter
        alia, that (1) the best interests of a child are an  integral  part
        of the proportionality assessment under  Article  8  ECHR;  (2)  In
        making that assessment, the best interests of a  child  must  be  a
        primary  consideration,  although  not  always  the  only   primary
        consideration; and the child's best interests do not of  themselves
        have the status of the paramount consideration;  (3)  Although  the
        best interests of a child  can  be  outweighed  by  the  cumulative
        effect of other  considerations,  no  other  consideration  can  be
        treated as inherently more significant;....


    30. The finding of the Supreme Court in paragraph 24 is as follows:


          24. There is no irrationality in the conclusion that it was in the
   children's best                  interests to go with  their  parents  to
   the Republic of Congo. No doubt it would           have been possible  to
   have  stated  that,  other  things  being  equal,  it  was  in  the  best
   interests of the children that they  and  their  parents  stayed  in  the
   United                  Kingdom so that they could obtain  such  benefits
   as  health  care  and  education               which  the  decision-maker
   recognised might be  of  a  higher  standard  than  would              be
   available in the Congo. But other things were not equal.  They  were  not
   British             citizens. They had no right to future  education  and
   health care in this country.              They were part of a  close-knit
   family with highly educated parents and were of             an  age  when
   their emotional needs could  only  be  fully  met  within  the  immediate
   family unit. Such integration as had occurred into United Kingdom society
                  would have been  predominantly  in  the  context  of  that
   family  unit.  Most                 significantly,   the   decision-maker
   concluded that they could be removed to the            Republic of  Congo
   in  the  care  of  their  parents  without  serious  detriment  to  their
   well-being. We agree with Lady Dorrian's succinct summary of the position
   in             para 18 of the Inner House's opinion."




    31. It was therefore necessary for  the  Judge  not  only  to  properly
        assess the best interests but then to weight them as  part  of  the
        overall proportionality assessment as illustrated by the case of EV
        (Philippines).  The Judge recognises in paragraph 44 that there  is
        a  strong  public  interest  argument  for  having  a   transparent
        immigration policy but then appears to  discount  this  by  stating
        that it was unreasonable to expect the Third Appellant to return to
        Nigeria at that stage of her education and  life.   When  assessing
        whether the decision  is  proportionate  a  Judge  is  required  to
        balance all parties competing interests. The  Third  Appellant  was
        unable to meet Appendix FM which sets out the  requirements  to  be
        met  and  reflects  how,  under  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
        Convention, the balance will be struck between the right to respect
        for private and family life and the legitimate aims  of  protecting
        national security, public safety and the economic well-being of the
        UK; the prevention of disorder and crime; the protection of  health
        or morals; and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
        It also takes into account the need to safeguard  and  promote  the
        welfare of children in the United Kingdom.


    32.  It is also important to set out the weight  to  be  given  to  the
        basic principles of Article 8 which can  often  be  overlooked  and
        which were recently repeated by the European Court of Human  Rights
        in the case of BIAO v. DENMARK - 38590/10 - Chamber Judgment [2014]
        ECHR 304 (25 March 2014) in which it was stated:


              52. The Court notes that the essential object of Article 8  is
   to protect the                        individual against arbitrary action
   by the public authorities. There  may  in                 addition  be  a
   positive  obligation  inherent  in  effective   "respect"   for   private
     and family life  (see,  for  example,  S�derman  v.  Sweden  [GC],  no.
   5786/08,                � 78, 12 November 2013). In the context of  both
   positive and  negative                      obligations  the  State  must
   strike a fair balance between the competing                 interests  of
   the  individual  and  of  the  community  as   a   whole.   However,   in
   both contexts the State enjoys a certain  margin  of  appreciation  (see,
   inter               alia, Osman v. Denmark, no. 38058/09, � 53,  14  June
   2011). The present case                   concerns the refusal  to  grant
   the second  applicant  family  reunion  in                       Denmark.
   Therefore, this case is to be seen as  one  involving  an  allegation  of
          failure on the part of the  respondent  State  to  comply  with  a
   positive                     obligation (Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer
   v. the Netherlands, no. 50435/99,                  � 38, ECHR 2006-I).


              53.      The Court reiterates that a State is entitled,  as  a
   matter of well-established                international law  and  subject
   to   its    treaty    obligations,    to    control    the    entry    of
   aliens into its territory and their  residence  there  (see,  among  many
   other               authorities, Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the
   United Kingdom,                       judgment of  28  May  1985,  �  67,
   Series A no. 94, Boujlifa v. France,  judgment                    of  21
   October  1997,  �  42,  Reports  of  Judgments  and  Decisions  1997-VI).
          Moreover, Article 8 does not entail a  general  obligation  for  a
   State to                     respect immigrants' choice of the country of
   their residence and to                    authorise family reunion in its
   territory.  Nevertheless, in  a  case  which                    concerns
   family  life  as  well  as  immigration,  the   extent   of   a   State's
     obligations to admit to its territory  relatives  of  persons  residing
   there   will                     vary   according   to   the   particular
   circumstances of the persons involved and                    the  general
   interest  (see,  for  example,  Butt  v.  Norway,  no.  47017/09,  � 70,
     4 December 2012; Antwi and Others v. Norway, no. 26940/10,  �� 88-89,
              14 February 2012; Nunez v. Norway, no.  55597/09,  �� 66-70,

   265/07, � 64, 31 July 2008;                    Rodrigues  da  Silva  and
   Hoogkamer v. the Netherlands, cited above, � 39 and �                43,
   ECHR 2006-I; Priya v. Denmark (dec.), 13549/03, 6 July 2006 and  G�l  v.
          Switzerland,  judgment  of  19 February  1996,  Reports  1996-I).
   Factors to be                taken into account in this context  are  the
   extent to which family life is                     effectively  ruptured,
   the  extent   of   the   ties   in   the   Contracting   State,   whether
   there are insurmountable obstacles in the way of the family living in the
                  country of origin of one or more of them and whether there
   are factors of                    immigration  control  (for  example,  a
   history of breaches of immigration                 law) or considerations
   of   public   order   weighing    in    favour    of    exclusion    (see
   Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer, cited above; Ajayi and  Others  v.  the
   United                  Kingdom  (dec.),  no.  27663/95,  22  June  1999;
   Solomon  v. the  Netherlands  (dec.),                  no.  44328/98,  5
   September     2000).     Another     important      consideration      is
   whether family life was created at a time when the persons involved  were
              aware that the immigration status of one of them was such that
   the                     persistence of that family life within  the  host
   State would  from  the  outset                be  precarious  (see  Jerry
   Olajide Sarumi v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.                43279/98,
   26 January  1999  and  Andrey  Sheabashov   v.   Latvia   (dec.),   no.
     50065/99, 22 May 1999). Where this is the case the removal of the non-
          national family member would be incompatible with Article  8  only
   in                  exceptional circumstances (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and
   Balkandali, cited                     above, � 68; Mitchell v. the United
   Kingdom (dec.), no. 40447/98, 24                       November 1998, and
   Ajayi and Others, cited above; and Rodrigues da Silva                 and
   Hoogkamer, cited above).


    33. In assessing the approach taken by the Judge the  key  question  to
        concentrate on is whether the Judge struck a fair  balance  between
        the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a
        whole. I find for the reasons  set  out  above  and  an  inadequate
        assessment of the  competing  interests  in  the  determination  by
        refernce to the later case law, that it  cannot  be  said  in  this
        instance  that  the  Judge  has  undertaken  a  properly   balanced
        proportionality exercise .


    34. I set the determination aside and proceed to  remake  the  decision
        based upon the  evidence  that  was  available  to  the  First-tier
        Tribunal and in light of  an  additional  factor  of  the  need  to
        consider the statutory provisions  now  incorporated  in  2002  Act
        which  I  have  reffered  above.  This  respect  Mr  Khan  in   his
        submissions  refers  to  section  117  and  the  changes   to   the
        Immigration Rules. These provisions are to be taken into account in
        all decisions made after 28 July 2014.


    35. A case involving similar issues to that this  appeal  is  R(on  the
        application of Osanwemwenze) v SSHD [2014] EWHC 1563 which,  whilst
        not specifically concerned with section 117B, has some relevance in
        terms of the reasonableness of a child  leaving  the  UK.  In  this
        case, the claimant's 14-year-old stepson from Nigeria had  been  in
        the United Kingdom for more than 7 years and had leave to remain in
        his own right. It was held that this was an important  but  not  an
        overriding consideration  and  it  was  reasonable  to  expect  the
        claimant's family including the stepson to relocate to Nigeria. The
        parents had experienced life there into adulthood and would be able
        to provide for the children and help them to reintegrate.


    36. The statutory provisions provide:


         "PART 5AArticle 8 of the ECHR: public interest considerations

         117A Application of this Part
         (1)  This Part applies where a court or  tribunal  is  required  to
determine whether a             decision made under the Immigration Acts-

              (a) breaches a person's  right  to  respect  for  private  and
family life under Article               8, and

              (b) as a result would be  unlawful  under  section  6  of  the
Human Rights Act                1998.

         (2)  In considering the public  interest  question,  the  court  or
tribunal must (in                   particular) have regard-

              (a) in all cases, to  the  considerations  listed  in  section
117B, and

              (b) in cases concerning the deportation of foreign  criminals,
to the                          considerations listed in section 117C.

              (3) In subsection (2), "the public  interest  question"  means
the question of                 whether  an  interference  with  a  person's
right to respect for private and                 family  life  is  justified
under Article 8(2).

         117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
cases
         (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in  the
public interest.

         (2)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
interests of the economic well-         being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
persons who seek to enter or remain in  the             United  Kingdom  are
able to speak English, because persons who can speak                English-


              (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

              (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
interests of the economic well-         being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
persons who seek to enter or remain in  the             United  Kingdom  are
financially independent, because such persons-

              (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

              (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)  Little weight should be given to-

              (a) a private life, or

              (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

                  that is established by a person at a time when the  person
is in the United                Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)  Little weight should be given to a  private  life  established
by a person at a time           when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
precarious.

         (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
public interest does            not require the person's removal where-

               (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
relationship with a                     qualifying child, and

              (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
the United Kingdom.



    37. The Tribunal must, in particular, have regard (a) in all cases,  to
        the considerations listed in section 117B.  Subsection (2) provides
        that "the public interest question" means the question  of  whether
        an interference with a person's right to respect  for  private  and
        family life is justified under Article  8(2).  Section  117A(2)  is
        mandatory.  As the public  interest  provisions  are  contained  in
        primary  legislation  they  override  existing  case  law.  Section
        117A(3) confirms that the Tribunal  is  required  to  carry  out  a
        balancing exercise.  In other words, the Tribunal cannot just  rely
        on the listed public interest factors as a basis  for  rejecting  a
        claim but must carry out a  balancing  exercise  where  a  person's
        circumstances engage article 8(1) to decide  whether  the  proposed
        interference is proportionate in all the circumstances.


    38. In this appeal all Appellants are able to speak English, and it  is
        not suggested they will be a burden to taxpayers  or  will  not  be
        able to integrate into society. It is also the case, however,  that
        they seek to rely upon private life established at a time  when  it
        is arguable their immigration status is precarious. It must be  the
        case that unless a person has permission to remain  in  the  United
        Kingdom by way of a grant of settled status or leave to remain that
        their status is precarious, i.e. there is no guarantee they will be
        permitted to remain. In this respect little weight can be given  to
        the private life this family unit rely upon.


    39. Mr Khan submits this is a law  abiding  family  but  in  Nasim  and
        others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 25 (IAC) it was held that a person's
        human rights are not enhanced by not committing  criminal  offences
        or not relying on public  funds.  The  only  significance  of  such
        matters in cases concerning proposed or hypothetical  removal  from
        the United Kingdom is to  preclude  the  Secretary  of  State  from
        pointing to any public interest justifying removal, over and  above
        the basic importance of maintaining a firm and coherent  system  of
        immigration control.


    40. It has not been established that this is a  case  in  which  family
        life will be lost or in which the Third Appellant will be unable to
        continue her education in her home state even allowing for the need
        to make certain adjustments. The fact there may be  differences  in
        that education when  compared  to  that  available  in  the  United
        Kingdom,  or  that  such  education  may  not  be  free,   is   not
        determinative. This  family  could  have  had  no  assurance  of  a
        guaranteed permanent settlement. It has not  been  shown  that  the
        child will be unable to reach  her  full  potential  but  has  been
        shown, based upon the changes to the Immigration  Rules,  statutory
        provisions and case law referred to above, that Article 8 does  not
        give individuals the right to choose where they wish  to  live  and
        nor is there any obligation upon the United Kingdom  to  educate  a
        person in a situation such as that of the Third  Appellant  who  is
        not settled and has no lawful right to remain.


    41. If the third Appellant wishes to study in the United Kingdom  there
        is always an option available to her upon return, and provided  she
        obtains the required grades, of making an application to allow  her
        to re-enter as a student. This places the Third  Appellant  in  the
        same situation as any other non-British national seeking  to  study
        at a UK educational institution. That is, however a matter for  her
        in the future. In relation  to  the  present,  there  is  no  right
        established for her and all other family  members  to  remain.  The
        Secretary  of  State  has   proved/established   that   it   is   a
        proportionate decision.   Removal and re-adjustment  has  not  been
        shown to result in consequences of sufficient gravity to  make  the
        decision disproportionate to the legitimate aim relied upon.


    42. The findings that the First, Second, Fourth and  Fifth  Appellant's
        have no basis to remain in their own right is a preserved  finding.
        It has not been established that it is disproportionate  to  remove
        the Third Appellant with her family and on that basis  the  appeals
        of all five appellants must be dismissed.





Decision

    43. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. The appeals are dismissed.


   Anonymity.


    44. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such order pursuant to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
