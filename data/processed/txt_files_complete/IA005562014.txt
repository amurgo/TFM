                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
PART 1

1.   This is an appeal brought  by  the  appellant  against  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge's  determination,  Judge  Ievins,  promulgated  on   26
    September 2014 whereby he dismissed the appeal against the Secretary of
    State's decision to refuse to grant him a residence card as a spouse of
    an EEA national exercising EEA treaty rights in  the  UK,  namely  Miss
    Elona Ivanova.  The application was made  under  paragraph  17  of  the
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  ("the   EEA
    Regulations").  The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan with a  date  of
    birth of 8 June 1965 so he is now 49 years old or so.  Miss Ivanova  is
    Latvian with a date of birth of 2 November  1988.   They  claimed  that
    they married on 23 March 2013.

2.   In the Secretary of State's detailed Reasons for Refusal  Letter  dated
    28 November 2013 she concluded that Miss Ivanova was not  a  worker  as
    detailed under Regulation 6 of the EEA Regulations.  Additionally,  she
    concluded that the appellant was  not  a  spouse  for  the  purpose  of
    Regulation 7 of the EEA Regulations since the marriage between him  and
    Miss Ivanova was, in  her  judgment,  one  of  convenience  only.   The
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal Judge took place on 18 September
    2014 and both the appellant and Miss Ivanova gave evidence.  The  judge
    found that the appellant was in a genuine marriage  with  Miss  Ivanova
    but went on to find that it  was  not  proven  that  Miss  Ivanova  was
    currently exercising treaty rights in that she was not a worker.

3.   In reaching that conclusion the judge said as follows:

         "As to whether the EEA sponsor is working, whilst there is a letter
         from Local Link Recruitment dated 11 July 2014, and another  letter
         dated 10 September 2014 brought to the hearing, and payslips  dated
         4 and 11 July 2014 there was nothing more recent to show  that  her
         work was continuing at the date of the hearing.  There were no bank
         statements in the bundle  showing  the  salary  entry  in  the  EEA
         sponsor's account.  During the hearing the EEA sponsor found a bank
         statement which she had with her dated 26 June  to  10  July  2014.
         There was a credit of �114.36 on 4 July 2014.  The EEA sponsor told
         me that this represented her pay of �129.36 less �15 which had been
         deducted for a driver.  There  was  nothing  else  which  indicated
         whether she was still employed or  otherwise  a  qualified  person.
         The EEA sponsor's own status was clearly in  issue  and  it  should
         have been a simple thing to ensure that all relevant documents were
         before me if she were indeed exercising treaty rights."

4.   On this appeal Miss King for the appellant asserts that the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge did not consider all the documentary evidence before her
    before making the finding that Miss Ivanova had not proved that she was
    working in the UK and thus exercising treaty rights.

5.   For the Secretary of State it is submitted  firstly,  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge directed herself appropriately in relation  to  the
    exercise of treaty rights and was entitled to conclude that the  burden
    of  proof  in  relation  to  the  question  of  working  had  not  been
    discharged.  Mr Tufan for the Secretary of State  goes  on  to  make  a
    separate attack on the First-tier Tribunal  Judge's  finding  that  the
    appellant was in a genuine marriage.   He  complains  that  the  judge,
    unlawfully, failed to  engage  with  the  detailed  reasons  given  the
    Secretary of State's refusal notice for concluding  that  the  marriage
    was a sham and one of convenience only, and he refers in particular  to
    the case of Madaga v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2006]
    EWCA Civ 820 in particular at paragraph 20.  There it was said  by  the
    Court of Appeal that  in  their  judgment  it  was  imperative  for  an
    adjudicator to explain how  she  reached  her  main  conclusion  having
    regard  to  the  response  statement,   the   discrepancies   and   the
    discrepancies in question.  It was insufficient simply to say that  the
    adjudicator had had regard to the response statement.

6.   It is also  said  for  the  Secretary  of  State  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge made a fundamental error in concluding  as  she  did  in
    paragraph 9 of her judgment that there was an entirely plausible reason
    for the appellant and Miss Ivanova not living in the same town  because
    the appellant did not have the necessary visa  documentation  entitling
    him to obtain work where Miss Ivanova lived, namely in Boston.   It  is
    said that that finding was wholly inconsistent with an  acknowledgement
    letter said to have been sent to the appellant on 15 April  2013  which
    assured him in  terms  that  he  was  permitted  to  accept  offers  of
    employment in the UK or to continue in employment in the UK whilst  his
    application for a residence card was under consideration.  And  it  was
    apparently said in this letter as a matter of standard wording that the
    document in question, namely the acknowledgment, should be kept because
    an employer might ask to see the document as evidence of eligibility to
    work.

7.   We comment even at this stage that this letter does not appear to  have
    been placed before the First-tier Tribunal Judge either as  a  document
    or even by way of reference as to its substance.

8.   There was at the beginning of this hearing a potential question  as  to
    whether or not the Secretary of State should be  entitled  to  mount  a
    challenge to the First-tier Tribunal Judge's  finding  in  relation  to
    marriage permission having been sought and without  a  separate  appeal
    notice having been issued.

9.   We are persuaded in  reliance  on  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department v EG  and  NG  [2013]  UKUT  143  (IAC),  in  particular  at
    paragraph 46 that in circumstances where a respondent does not seek  to
    challenge the outcome but seeks to raise additional grounds upon  which
    reliance should be place under  Tribunal  Rule  2008,  Rule  24(3f)  no
    separate appeal notice is required  and  the  Secretary  of  State  has
    properly raised the matter in the response letter that has been  served
    in these proceedings.

10.  We turn against that background to consider  the  two  issues  in  this
    case.  We remind ourselves that  an appeal to this Tribunal  only  lies
    on a basis of an error of law, see Section 11 of the Tribunals,  Courts
    and Enforcement Act 2007 and for example the clear statement as to what
    an error of law consists of in R (Iran) v Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982.

11.  As to the First-tier Tribunal  Judge's  findings  on  the  question  of
    marriage, we are not persuaded that any material error of  law  exists.
    In essence the Secretary of State is doing  no  more  than  disagreeing
    with a First-tier's conclusions of fact.  She was fully  aware  or  the
    many inconsistencies in the appellant's interviews and  those  of  Miss
    Ivanova and he took into  account  those  inconsistencies  additionally
    highlighted through the exercise  of  cross-examination.   However  she
    went on to find overall that what the appellant and Miss  Ivanova  said
    had the ring of truth.  She  found,  as  we  have  said,  there  was  a
    plausible reason for them not living together.  She placed reliance  on
    the fact that the appellant and Miss Ivanova knew  about  each  other's
    family and friends and she placed reliance on the  texts  between  them
    suggesting  contact  and  meeting  regularly,  which  she  accepted  as
    genuine.

12.  Having seen and heard them, in our judgment, she was entitled to  reach
    the conclusion that she did on the question of  marriage.   We  do  not
    accept the criticism that there was some unlawful  failure  to  address
    the detailed reasoning of the Secretary of State  in  her  Reasons  for
    Refusal Letter.  She clearly had that letter well in mind.  She records
    on several occasions in her judgment the fact that  inconsistencies  in
    the evidence are present but goes on to state in terms why she does not
    consider them to be reason of  themselves  to  reject  the  appellant's
    version of events and his credibility on the question of marriage.

13.  As for the Secretary of State's reliance on the acknowledgement  letter
    of 15 April 2013, it cannot be said by reference to that document  that
    the learned judge below made any material error of  law.   As  we  have
    already recorded, the letter itself was never produced  to  the  court,
    indeed nor was it even referred to.  It was not, so it appears  and  as
    appears to be a matter of common ground before us,  not  to  have  been
    relied on in any way either by way of submission or,  for  example,  by
    way of cross-examination of the appellant and  Miss  Ivanova  who  both
    relied on and referred to the visa situation as being an impediment  to
    them living together in Boston.

14.  It follows that neither the appellant nor Miss  Ivanova  ever  had  the
    opportunity to respond to the assertion that the acknowledgement letter
    of 15 April 2013 meant that there was no impediment  to  the  appellant
    obtaining work in Boston.

15.  Finally we record the fact that Mr Tufan realistically accepts  in  his
    submissions  that  the  15  April  letter  and  the  question  of  visa
    impediment to working is not, as he put it, a  central  matter  in  any
    event.

16.  We therefore reject that ground of appeal raised by  the  Secretary  of
    State and we turn to the ground of the appellant's appeal which is,  as
    we have recorded, an attack on the  correctness of the judge's decision
    not to find on a balance of  probabilities  that  Miss  Ivanova  was  a
    worker.

17.  Having  carefully  considered  the  competing  submissions  and  having
    carefully examined the contents of paragraph  11  of  the  judgment  in
    particular, we are persuaded that there was a material error of law  on
    the part of the First-tier Tribunal Judge in  failing  to  give  proper
    consideration to all the evidence before  her.   In  our  judgment  she
    ignored, and it is clear on the face  of  the  judgment  that  she  did
    ignore, for example payslips  postdating  11  July  2014,  for  example
    payslips up to 15 August 2014.

18.  Secondly, whilst she referred to a letter from Local  Link  Recruitment
    dated 10 September 2014, she does not explain in any way  why,  in  the
    light of the contents of that letter, she effectively rejected  it  and
    nevertheless concludes that Miss Ivanova was not a worker.

19.  The letter of 10 September read as follows:

         "Employment certification letter.  This letter is  to  verify  that
         Elona Ivanova at the current address ... has been  an  employee  of
         Local Link Recruitment since 25  June  2014.   Miss  E  Ivanova  is
         working on the position of manual worker."

    That letter is dated 10 September as we have recorded and thus predates
    the hearing by only a week and one day.

20.  To that then one adds the witness evidence of the  appellant  and  Miss
    Ivanova herself.  As already indicated,  they  had  been  found  to  be
    credible on the question of marriage.   They  were  cross-examined  and
    their evidence was tested on both issue of marriage and worker.

21.  Nowhere in the judgment does the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  give  any
    reasons for rejecting their evidence to the effect  that  Miss  Ivanova
    was working as a manual worker at time of  the  hearing  and  in  those
    circumstances we conclude that a material error of law was made and  we
    set aside the determination below for that reason.

                              ================
PART 2

22.  For reasons given in an earlier determination we  have  set  aside  the
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge's  decision  in  one  limited  but  material
    respect, namely as to the question of whether or not Miss Ivanova,  the
    appellant's sponsor, is an EEA national exercising treaty rights  as  a
    worker.

23.  Having set that part of the  decision  aside  we  are  now  invited  to
    remake it. We are content to do so, on the basis of  the  evidence  and
    the findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge below, and the additional
    material now placed before us.  We   take  into  account  the  material
    before the judge below, her findings so far as material and undisturbed
    by our  earlier  determination  and  the  new  documentation  available
    including

    (a)  A letter from a recruitment agency dated today  in  the  following
         terms:


             "Please accept this letter as confirmation that Elona  Ivanova
             has worked for us since 11 December and is currently still  on
             an ongoing assignment."


         That  certification  is  signed  by  David  Joyner,  an  operations
             director.

    (b)  Payslips up to 12 December 2014, that is to say last week, showing
         earnings a process stage, a national insurance number  and  finally
         bank account details up  to  12  December  2014  showing  the  sums
         recorded in the payslips going into Miss Ivanova's account.

24.  On the basis of these matters, we  are  satisfied  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities that the appellant has established now that Miss  Ivanova
    is an EEA national exercising treaty rights as  a  worker.   For  those
    reasons we allow this appeal.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Before the First-tier Judge no fee award was made  because  the  appeal  has
been  dismissed.   In  light  of  this  Tribunal's  decision  the  following
decision is  substituted.   The  appeal  has  been  allowed  both  upon  the
material before the original Tribunal and more recent material  but  in  any
event a fee was paid of �140  and  in  the  light  of  the  outcome  of  the
decision today it is appropriate for a fee award  to  be  made  against  the
respondent.

No anonymity order was requested nor is necessary.
