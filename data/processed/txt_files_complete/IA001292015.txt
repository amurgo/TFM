For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 25 December 1981. On 21
      June 2014 he made an application for a Residence Card as the  extended
      family member of his cousin, Mr Saqib Ali Qureshi,  a  Dutch  national
      exercising Treaty rights in the UK. The application  was  refused  for
      reasons set out in a letter  dated  24  November  2014  which  can  be
      briefly reduced to the point  that  the  appellant  had  not  provided
      sufficient evidence to show  he  was  dependent  on  his  cousin.  The
      appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and elected to have  his
      appeal decided on the papers without an oral hearing.


   2. In a decision promulgated on 30 July  2015  Judge  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal G Jones QC dismissed the appeal. He said  the  appellant  had
      "adduced no documents to be relied upon at the  appeal",  although  he
      had provided a witness statement and also a brief statement  from  his
      cousin.  The  judge  was  not  satisfied  there   was   any   familial
      relationship between the appellant and his cousin due to the fact  the
      expression  "cousin"  is  not  necessarily  synonymous  with  a  blood
      relative in Pakistani culture. He found the appellant was not a member
      of his cousin's household before coming to the UK in 2011 or  that  he
      was a member of his cousin's household in the UK.


   3. Permission to appeal  was  refused  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  but
      granted on a  renewed  application  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.  It  was
      arguable the Judge  had  erred  in  two  ways:  (1)  by  treating  the
      relationship as being in issue given it was not raised in the  reasons
      for  refusal  letter;  and  (2)  by  failing  to  consider   financial
      dependency as an alternative to membership of the same  household  and
      overlooking the evidence of two remittances from  the  cousin  to  the
      appellant in June 2011 and payments from the cousin to  the  appellant
      in 2014.


   4. The appellant wrote to the Tribunal on  10  March  2016  requesting  a
      decision on papers. The Tribunal replied to his letter  the  same  day
      explaining the hearing would go ahead as the respondent  may  wish  to
      make submissions and that a decision would be made on the basis of the
      documents in the file.


   5. Ms Fijiwala made brief submissions, which I have recorded.


   Error of law


   6. Ms Fijiwala did not argue the Judge's decision  was  not  vitiated  by
      error of law and I agree with her.


   7. The Judge erred on a fairness point by raising a new issue, not  taken
      against the appellant  in  the  refusal  letter,  without  giving  the
      appellant an opportunity to present evidence on the issue.  There  was
      some evidence in the form of the family registration  to  confirm  the
      relationship in any event, which the Judge did not address.


   8. He also erred by limiting his consideration to membership of the  same
      household. The EEA Regulations read in relevant part as follows:


             "8. - "Extended family member"
             (1) In these Regulations  "extended  family  member"  means  a
             person who is not a family member of  an  EEA  national  under
             regulation  7(1)(a),  (b)  or  (c)  and  who   satisfies   the
             conditions in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).
             (2) A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if  the
             person is a relative of an EEA national,  his  spouse  or  his
             civil partner and-
             (a) the person is residing in a country other than the  United
             Kingdom and is dependent upon the EEA national or is a  member
             of his household;
             (b) the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a) and is
             accompanying the EEA national to the United Kingdom or  wishes
             to join him there; or
             (c) the person satisfied the condition in paragraph  (a),  has
             joined the EEA national in the United Kingdom and continues to
             be dependent upon him or to be a member of his household."


   9. In Dauhoo (EEA Regulations - reg 8(2)) Mauritius [2012] UKUT 79  (IAC)
      the Upper Tribunal explained the  various  permutations  available  to
      applicants seeking to show they  are  extended  family  members  under
      Regulation 8(2):

         "Under the scheme set out in reg 8 (2) of the Immigration (European
         Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006,  a  person   can   succeed   in
         establishing that he or she is an "extended family member"  in  any
         one of four different  ways,  each  of  which  requires  proving  a
         relevant connection both prior to arrival in the UK and in the UK:


                         i. prior dependency and present dependency


                        ii. prior membership  of  a  household  and  present
                            membership of a household


                       iii. prior dependency and  present  membership  of  a
                            household;


                        iv. prior membership  of  a  household  and  present
                            dependency.


          It  is  not  necessary,  therefore,  to  show  prior  and  present
         connection in the same capacity:  i.e.  dependency-  dependency  or
         household membership-household membership ((i) or  (ii)  above).  A
         person may also qualify if able to show (iii) or (iv)."


  10. As noted, the Judge only considered membership of the  same  household
      before and after the appellant came to the UK. He did not consider the
      assertions made and evidence submitted regarding dependency.


  11. I therefore set aside the decision of Judge Jones.


   Re-making the decision
  12. The appellant was advised in standard directions that, if an error  of
      law were found, the Tribunal may go on to re-make the  decision.  This
      point was made again to the appellant in response to his request for a
      decision on the papers. The appellant has chosen  not  to  attend  his
      appeal hearing and not to file further evidence.  The  only  documents
      available are those filed in advance of the hearing in the  First-tier
      Tribunal. Given the appellant's  preference  for  a  decision  on  the
      papers (in both Tribunals) I saw no reason to adjourn. I proceeded  to
      hear the appeal so as to re-make the decision.


  13. I have read the documents contained in the  respondent's  bundle,  the
      witness statements and the two remittance slips.


  14. I shall proceed on the basis the appellant and his cousin are related.
      There is no  limitation  to  the  type  of  relationship  which  would
      qualify.


  15. Ms Fijiwala asked me to dismiss the appeal on the basis that  none  of
      the four possible permutations identified in Dauhoo applied.


  16. The burden of proof is on the appellant with regard to any  assertions
      of fact which he makes and the standard of proof is the civil standard
      of a balance of probabilities.  I  may  consider  evidence  about  any
      matter which I think  relevant  to  the  substance  of  the  decision,
      including evidence which concerns a matter arising after the  date  of
      decision.


  17. Guidance has been given  on  the  interpretation  and  application  of
      Regulation 8(2) in a number of cases.


  18. In Moneke (EEA - OFMs) Nigeria [2011]  UKUT  00341  (IAC),  the  Upper
      Tribunal said the requirements to show dependency or membership of the
      same household must be on a person who  is  an  EEA  national  at  the
      material time.


  19. In Moneke (EEA - OFMs - assessment of evidence)  Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT
      00430 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal reminded Tribunals that the supporting
      evidence should be scrutinised with  some  care.  In  determining  the
      appeals in that case, some weight was given to the fact the appellants
      had misrepresented their intentions when seeking entry as visitors.


  20. In Reyes (EEA Regs: dependency)  [2013]  UKUT  314  (IAC),  the  Upper
      Tribunal said:


         "19. From the above, we glean four key things. First, the  test  of
         dependency is a purely factual test. Second,  the  Court  envisages
         that questions  of  dependency  must  not  be  reduced  to  a  bare
         calculation of financial dependency but should be construed broadly
         to involve a holistic examination of a number of factors, including
         financial, physical and  social  conditions,  so  as  to  establish
         whether there is dependence that is genuine.  The  essential  focus
         has to be on the  nature  of  the  relationship  concerned  and  on
         whether it is one characterised by a situation of dependence  based
         on an examination of all the factual circumstances, bearing in mind
         the underlying objective of maintaining the unity of the family. It
         seems to us that the need for a wide-ranging fact-specific approach
         is indeed enjoined by the Court of Appeal in  SM  (India):  see  in
         particular Sullivan LJ's observations at [27]-[28].  Third,  it  is
         clear from the wording of both Article 2.2 and regulation 7(1) that
         the test is one of present, not past  dependency.  Both  provisions
         employ the present tense (Article 2.2(b) and (c)  refer  to  family
         members who "are dependants" or  who  are  "dependent";  regulation
         7(c) refers to "dependent direct relatives..."). Fourth  (and  this
         may have relevance to what is understood  by  present  dependency),
         interpretation of the meaning of the term must be such  as  not  to
         deprive that provision of its effectiveness."


  21. In Lim (EEA - dependency) [2013] UKUT 00437 (IAC), the Upper  Tribunal
      considered the meaning of dependence and noted the  Court  of  Justice
      had expressly approved dependency of choice in the  form  of  choosing
      not to take up employment.

  22. The evidence of prior membership of a household consists of  the  bald
      assertions in the statements of the appellant and his cousin.  It  was
      absent from the affidavit of sponsorship made by Mr Qureshi on 9  June
      2014. There are no documents supporting the assertion.  The  reference
      in paragraph 3 of Mr Qureshi's statement to  visiting  Pakistan  after
      moving to the Netherlands at a time that the  appellant  was  residing
      with his cousins also undermines the notion  that  the  appellant  was
      residing in Mr Qureshi's household. I find as fact that he was not.


  23. As for prior dependency, the sole  evidence,  apart  from  assertions,
      consists of two remittance slips. These purport  to  show  Mr  Qureshi
      sending the appellant �1198 on 6 April 2011 and �999 on 30 June  2011.
      The statements do not make specific reference to these remittances and
      only refer in general to remittances. No information has been provided
      as to why these amounts were sent to the appellant. There is reference
      in the statements to Mr Qureshi arranging the appellant's studies  but
      I cannot speculate this was the  reason  for  the  money  being  sent.
      Standing in isolation these two documents are not sufficient  evidence
      to show regular remittances to support the appellant in Pakistan.  The
      statements  suggest  the  appellant  was  primarily  supported  by  Mr
      Qureshi's family. There is no evidence showing the money mentioned  in
      the remittance slips leaving Mr Qureshi's account or being received in
      Pakistan by the appellant, let alone what he used the money for. I  am
      not satisfied the appellant has established he was  dependent  on  his
      cousin before coming to the UK.


  24. It follows that the requirements of the Regulations are not fulfilled.
      I should say that I would  also  find  the  appellant  has  not  shown
      dependency or membership of the  same  household  in  the  UK.  Whilst
      assertions are made in the statements and  there  is  evidence  of  Mr
      Qureshi transferring money to the  appellant's  Lloyds  bank  account,
      this evidence does not satisfy me the dependency is  genuine.  I  note
      that the bank statements give the  appellant's  address  as  21  [  ],
      Hounslow, which is Mr Qureshi's address. However,  the  appellant  now
      gives his address as 724A [  ],  Hounslow.  There  is  no  independent
      evidence showing this is also the address now occupied by Mr  Qureshi.
      It would be a very straightforward matter to provide such evidence and
      I draw an adverse inference from  the  failure  to  present  any  such
      evidence given the centrality of the issue to the appeal.


  25. The appeal is dismissed.
