                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the determination of the First-tier Tribunal,
    comprising a panel, presided over  by  Designated  Judge  McClure,  and
    accompanied by First-tier Tribunal Judge Trent, promulgated on 15th May
    2019, following a hearing at  Manchester  on  7th  May  2019.   In  the
    determination,  the  panel  dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,
    whereupon the Appellant subsequently  applied  for,  and  was  granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant, NN, is a citizen of South Africa, and  she  applied  for
    leave to remain in the UK as a spouse of a person present  and  settled
    in the UK.  Her application was refused on 28th April 2015.  The  basis
    of her claim is that she is HIV positive, and is married  to  a  person
    known as EN, who originally had refugee status in the UK, as a  citizen
    of Zimbabwe, but now has full British citizenship, and is based in this
    country.  He too, however, is HIV positive.   There  is  evidence  that
    upon entry into the UK in 2004, the Appellant properly registered  with
    the Leicester Royal Infirmary for HIV treatment  (paragraph  42).   She
    also takes tablets for high blood pressure, as does  her  partner,  EN.
    The essence of  her  claim  is  that  there  would  be  limits  on  the
    medication available to her in Africa.  She herself  is  a  citizen  of
    South Africa.

The Judges' Findings

 3. The panel concluded  that  the  Appellant  and  her  partner  were  not
    prevented from enjoying family  life  either  in  South  Africa  or  in
    Zimbabwe.  The Appellant herself was born in South Africa and had spent
    nearly 30 years there.   There  were  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life being continued in South Africa (paragraph 65).  There were
    medical facilities available both in South Africa and in Zimbabwe.   It
    may be that medical treatment has to be paid for, but given the  income
    of EN (who earnt in the region of ï¿½47,000 per annum (see paragraph  48)
    such treatment remained accessible to them.  They could afford  to  pay
    for the drugs in South Africa or  in  Zimbabwe,  "at  least  while  the
    Appellant is in one such country to make an application  for  entry  to
    the UK" (paragraph 66).

 4. The reason why the Panel took the view that this was simply a matter of
    the Appellant returning in order to make an application to return  back
    as a spouse of EN, was that EN himself now had settled status in the UK
    as a British citizen.  The Panel accepted that they were  both  married
    in 2001 and they had two children, who had been left behind in Zimbabwe
    with relatives (see paragraphs 59 to 60).  Therefore, the view  of  the
    Panel  was  that,  "there  are  no  insurmountable  obstacles  or  very
    significant obstacles to the Appellant returning  to  South  Africa  or
    Zimbabwe  and  making  an  application  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom
    lawfully" (paragraph 69).  Finally, in relation to whether  there  were
    "exceptional circumstances" the panel decided that, "we have considered
    further whether or not there  are  exceptional  circumstances.   Having
    considered all the evidence we find that there are no such  exceptional
    circumstances" (paragraph 75).

 5. The appeal was dismissed.

The Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application states that the panel erred in two respects.
     First, it conflated the issue of  whether  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing outside the UK with  the  issue  of
    whether the Appellant could be expected to return to South  Africa  and
    make an application for entry clearance.  However, the Respondent  Home
    Office's own policy on "Family  Migration:  Appendix  FM  Section  1.0b
    Family Life (as a Partner or Parent) and Private Life: 10-Year  Routes"
    (Version 4.0, 11th April 2019), made it clear that in  cases  of  "very
    serious hardship" involving "a serious illness which  requires  ongoing
    medical treatment", an application could  succeed  because  this  would
    amount to insurmountable obstacles.  Second, in  stating  that  it  was
    open to the Appellant to return back to Zimbabwe to make an application
    the  Tribunal  misdirected  itself  or  misapplied  the  authority   of
    Chikwamba, because there  was  no  public  interest  in  requiring  the
    Appellant to do so, in circumstances where the Appellant was  otherwise
    certain to be granted leave to enter.

 7. On 22nd July 2019, permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal on both grounds.

Submissions

 8. At the hearing before me on  3rd  September  2019,  the  Appellant  was
    represented by Miss Cleghorn of Counsel  and  she  submitted  that  the
    Tribunal had actually failed to take note of what had been said in Chen
    [2015] UKUT 189 where the Tribunal found that "there may  be  cases  in
    which there are  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  being
    enjoyed outside the United Kingdom where temporary separation to enable
    an individual to  make  an  application  for  entry  clearance  may  be
    disproportionate".  She submitted that this was the  case  here.   Both
    she and EN suffered from HIV/Aids.  Secondly, the judge's treatment  of
    "exceptional circumstances" (at paragraph 75) is jejune as it is  short
    and without any accompanying reasons.

 9. For his part, Mr Mills submitted  that  the  fact  here  was  that  the
    Appellant's legal representatives  had  failed  to  provide  clear  and
    irrefutable evidence of difficulties that the Appellant would  face  in
    procuring medical treatment in Zimbabwe.  In fact, the appeal had  been
    dogged  by  years  of  incompetent  legal  representation.   When   the
    Appellant first embarked on her appeal, she was  coughing  blood.   The
    judge adjourned the matter and gave a direction that there should be  a
    medical  report  on  her  condition.   She  may  have  had   infectious
    tuberculosis or other illnesses.  Despite  that  direction,  the  legal
    representatives failed to comply with what was required of them.   This
    happened yet  again  the  second  time,  when  proceedings  had  to  be
    adjourned again.  On the third occasion the judge  proceeded  with  the
    hearing, despite non-compliance, only to be corrected on appeal on  the
    basis that he ought really to have adjourned.  All that was before  the
    Tribunal panel on this occasion was some newspaper accounts  confirming
    that there would be difficulty in accessing treatment in South  Africa,
    of which the Appellant is a citizen, were she  to  be  returned  there.
    There was no cogent evidence however.

10. The procedural history had so far been overlooked and it  may  well  be
    that it could have pointed to  where  the  public  interest  lay.   The
    panel's view was that the Appellant's husband earnt enough money to  be
    able to pay for treatment overseas.  Unless that could be  successfully
    challenged, it was a view that was open to the panel.  There  would  be
    no insurmountable obstacles.  It is true that there was delay  in  this
    appeal and that too could point  to  where  the  public  interest  lay,
    because it had been accepted as long ago as EB  (Kosovo)  that  a  long
    period of delay has an impact on the public interest in  removal  of  a
    person who in normal circumstances should be removed, but  who  due  to
    the passage of time has now laid down roots such that he or she  should
    be allowed to remain.

Error of Law

11. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  panel  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.  First, this is a case where both
    the Appellant and EN, her partner, are HIV positive.  He was a  citizen
    of Zimbabwe, but is now a citizen of the  United  Kingdom.   She  is  a
    citizen of South Africa.  Given that they are both HIV positive,  there
    is a Home Office policy, which the Grounds of Appeal make reference to,
    on family migration, which makes it clear that,

         "Independent medical evidence could establish that  a  physical  or
         mental  disability,  or  serious  illness  which  requires  ongoing
         medical treatment, would lead  to  a  very  serious  hardship:  for
         example, due to the lack of  adequate  healthcare  in  the  country
         where the family would be  required  to  live.   As  such,  in  the
         absence  of  a  third  country  alternative,  it  could  amount  to
         insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing overseas."

12. The panel does not address this Home Office policy and its implications
    for the Appellant.  What the  panel  does  do  is  to  address  medical
    treatment for the Appellant  in  circumstances  where  she  would  only
    temporarily be in South Africa  (or  Zimbabwe)  in  order  to  make  an
    application for entry clearance.  However, if the Appellant's claim  is
    that  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  both  herself  and  EN
    continuing family life in either of these countries, then the issue  of
    temporary residence is irrelevant, and the Home Office policy needs  to
    be properly looked at.  This is especially so,  given  that  there  was
    evidence before the panel (which it has  not  overlooked  as  evidence)
    that "the burden of disease in South Africa had led to  the  demand  of
    healthcare  to  grow  exponentially,  leaving  the  system   'extremely
    overloaded'", according to the Minister of Health in South Africa,  who
    had said that "this has resulted in very long waiting times in most  of
    the facilities and lowering of quality in others" (see the  article  by
    Alex Mitchley, "the public healthcare system is  very  distressed,  but
    not collapsing - Motsoaledi" (News 24, 5th  June  2018)).   The  matter
    needed proper consideration because in relation to EN, he is a  British
    citizen, who is already in receipt of  HIV  medical  treatment  in  the
    United Kingdom.  To require him to forego his entitlement, as a British
    citizen, to free specialist treatment under the NHS, if it is the  case
    that he would face inferior treatment in South Africa (or Zimbabwe), is
    a matter which would render the decision disproportionate.

13. Second, it does  appear  that  the  panel  has  misdirected  itself  in
    relation to the Chikwamba point.  This is a case where the  couple  are
    lawfully married, and enjoyed a family life  both  in  Zimbabwe  (where
    they have two children) and have been doing so in the  United  Kingdom.
    There is no illegality and no public interest in the refusal  of  leave
    to the Appellant to remain in this country as her sponsoring  husband's
    wife.  Were she to be able to return back to a country in order to make
    an application to enter as her spouse, it  would  appear  that  she  is
    "otherwise certain to be  granted  leave  to  enter"  (see  Agyarko  at
    paragraph 51).  The question is whether "there was any sensible  reason
    as to why he will be required to do so" (see MA (Pakistan) [2009]  EWCA
    Civ 953).  It does not appear that there are any  sensible  reasons  at
    all for why they should be required to do so, if it is indeed the  case
    that there are "insurmountable obstacles" by virtue of  the  fact  that
    the Appellant succeeds under the Home Office's  own  policy  in  Family
    Migration: Appendix FM Section 1.0b Family Life, because the  Appellant
    suffers "a serious illness which requires  ongoing  medical  treatment,
    which would lead to very serious hardship".

14. Third, this is a case where the panel has gone on to  consider  whether
    there are  "exceptional  circumstances".   However,  although  this  is
    addressed in the final paragraph (at paragraph 75), all that is said is
    that "having considered all of the evidence we find that there  are  no
    such  exceptional  circumstances".   This,  however,  is   insufficient
    reasoning.  This is because, as the decision in Agyarko [2017] UKSC  11
    explains,  "the  European  Court's  use  of  the  phrase   'exceptional
    circumstances' in this context was considered by the Court of Appeal in
    MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 (at paragraph 56).  The Supreme Court
    goes on to say that,

         "Ultimately it has to decide whether the refusal  is  proportionate
         in the particular case before it, balancing  the  strength  of  the
         public interest in the removal of the person  in  question  against
         the impact on private and family life.  In doing so, it should give
         appropriate weight to the Secretary of State's policy, expressed in
         the Rules and Instructions, that the public interest in immigration
         control can be outweighed,  when  considering  an  application  for
         leave to remain brought by a person in the  UK  in  breach  of  the
         Immigration Rules, only where there are 'insurmountable  obstacles'
         or 'exceptional circumstances' as defined." (Paragraph 57).

15. What is interesting here  is  that  the  Supreme  Court  then  provided
    helpful guidance when it went on to say in Agyarko that,

         "The Secretary of State has not imposed a test of exceptionality in
         the sense that the case should exhibit some highly unusual feature,
         over and above the application of the test for proportionality.  On
         the contrary, she had defined the  word  'exceptional'  as  already
         explained, as meaning circumstances  in  which  the  refusal  would
         result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual  such
         that the refusal of the application would  not  be  proportionate."
         (Paragraph 60).

16. All the evidence suggested, that with the healthcare  system  in  South
    Africa  being  "very  distressed"  that  the   Appellant   would   face
    "unjustifiably harsh consequences" if she were to be required to  leave
    the UK to go back to that country and make an application to  re-enter.



Remaking the Decision

17. I have remade the decision on the basis  of  the  evidence  before  the
    Tribunal below, the findings made by that Tribunal, and the submissions
    that I have heard today.  I am allowing this  appeal  for  the  reasons
    that I have already set out above.




Notice of Decision

18. The decision of the panel below amounted to an error of law  such  that
    it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of the panel of the
    UTJ McClure.  I remake the decision under Section 12(2) of TCEA 2007 as
    follows.  This appeal is allowed.

19. An anonymity direction is made.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
