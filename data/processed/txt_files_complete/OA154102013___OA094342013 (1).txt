Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr K Alim, Counsel, instructed by Yaqub & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants are nationals of India being a mother and  daughter  who
    applied to join their husband/father  in  the  United  Kingdom.   Their
    applications were refused and subsequent  appeal  dismissed  under  the
    Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Ross in a determination promulgated on 29th April 2014.

 2. Grounds of application were lodged on a number of points.  Firstly,  it
    was said that the first Appellant had made an application on 18 October
    2012 prior to the second Appellant but had withdrawn  that  application
    because she did not pass the English language requirement. As such  the
    judge was wrong to say that there was no application made by the  first
    Appellant until after the refusal of entry clearance to his daughter.

 3. Secondly, paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE of the Rules provided the  Home
    Office caseworkers with flexibility to  request  missing  evidence  and
    that should have been done in this case.  Finally it was said that  the
    judge had failed to apply relevant case law. A judge of the  First-tier
    Tribunal found all the  grounds  arguable  and  granted  permission  to
    appeal.

 4. The Home Office lodged a Rule 24 notice saying that while it  might  be
    demonstrated that the  judge  was  wrong  in  finding  that  the  first
    Appellant did not apply for entry clearance until after her daughter it
    was immaterial in that the judge found that the  correct  evidence  had
    not been submitted in accordance with Appendix FM -SE.

 5. Thus the matter came before me on the above date. For the Appellant  Mr
    Alim submitted that the judge was wrong to have treated  Article  8  in
    the way he had.  He had ignored the written and oral  evidence  of  the
    sponsor and also the written evidence of the Appellant Mrs Kaur at page
    8  of  the  bundle  who  confirmed  their  marriage  was  genuine   and
    subsisting.  No findings had been made  in  regard  to  that  evidence.
    Rather the judge had wrongly concluded that if the daughter's claim had
    succeeded the evidence suggested that the mother would  have  continued
    to live in India with her other daughters and that  she  was  separated
    from her husband.  Such a finding was not justified and I  was  invited
    to find there was a material error of law and to a order a rehearing of
    the case.

 6. Separately, while it was accepted that the Appellants did  not  satisfy
    the detailed requirements of Appendix  FM-SE  the  Secretary  of  State
    should have exercised her discretion under paragraph FM-SE-D and called
    for the missing documents to be lodged.

 7. For the Home Office it was said that the  application  did  fail  under
    Appendix  FM  for  reasons  found  by  the  Secretary  of   State   and
    subsequently by the judge.  I was  referred  to  the  particular  Rules
    which applied as at the date of decision (I was  very  grateful  to  Mr
    Jarvis for producing these).  In particular what was  missing  was  any
    documentation from Ralston Tools.  The bank statements were inadequate.
     The evidential flexibility policy did not assist the Appellant in this
    case.  Given that there was nothing compelling about the  circumstances
    of this application and as such the judge did not err  in  law  in  his
    consideration of Article 8 ECHR.

 8. I reserved my decision.

Conclusions

 9. The difficulty in the judge's determination is his  assessment  of  the
    Appellant's  claim  under  Article  8  ECHR.   He  attached  particular
    importance to the fact that the Sponsor's wife had made no  application
    to join him until after the refusal of entry clearance to his  daughter
    on 12th March 2013.  In paragraph 11 of his determination he  makes  it
    clear that if the daughter's claim had succeeded the evidence suggested
    that the mother  would  continue  to  live  in  India  with  her  other
    daughters and that she was separated from her  husband.   It  was  said
    there was no evidence of devotion between husband and wife.

10. However it seems that  the  factual  foundation  for  this  finding  is
    unsound.   It  is  not  disputed  that  the  first  Appellant  made  an
    application on 18 October 2012 (reference number given)  and  that  the
    second Appellant made her application on 22  November  2012  (reference
    number given).  It does not  appear  to  be  disputed  that  the  first
    Appellant did not continue with the application  because  she  did  not
    pass the English language requirement and  that  the  second  Appellant
    would have been over age if she did not continue.

11. The judge did not consider  this  explanation.  Because  there  was  no
    evidence of devotion between the husband and wife he concluded that the
    marriage was not subsisting.

12. It is fair to say that there was a considerable body of evidence before
    the judge that the marriage was subsisting.  By implication he  rejects
    this evidence although he does not say so in terms.

13. The written evidence of the Sponsor says that they  have  been  married
    since 2nd December 1988 and have lived together as a husband  and  wife
    until 2001.  They have three children. He has been unable to return  to
    India while his case was going  on;  however  he  has  always  been  in
    contact with his wife and children and provides remittance receipts  in
    support of his claim.  He adopted his statement in  his  oral  evidence
    before the judge.  He produced his passport which showed trips to India
    in November 2011 and 2013. He referred to photographs in the bundle and
    said he was working. He said that he spoke to his wife every other day.
    In her statement Mrs  Kaur  says  that  the  marriage  is  genuine  and
    subsisting.  They have been living together  since  their  marriage  in
    1988.  They have again lived together as husband and  wife  during  his
    two visits to India as mentioned in his statement.  They are in contact
    with each other by telephone.  He supports her financially.   She  adds
    that the period of separation did not weaken their relationship but has
    cemented it. They  love  each  other  and  the  separation  period  has
    strengthened their marriage and relationship.  They  are  committed  to
    each other for a life time.  She points out that her daughter Kiran has
    also signed the statement.

14. If  all  or  most  of  this  evidence  was  being  rejected  (which  by
    implication it was) then the Appellants were entitled to proper reasons
    why that is so and none have  been  given  (apart  from  the  erroneous
    factual finding set out above). As such the judge has erred in  law  by
    failing to give adequate reasons on a material matter.

15. The position of the Home Office is that because the Appellants  do  not
    qualify under  Appendix  FM  there  is  nothing  compelling  about  the
    circumstances in this case and as such  the  Appellant  cannot  succeed
    under Article 8 ECHR and the decision should stand.

16. I do not consider that such a point  has  been  reached.  I  adopt  the
    approach in R (Nagre) v SSHD  [20132]  EWHC  720  (Admin)  and  Gulshan
    (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] 640 (IAC) in that  it
    is only after applying the requirements of the Rules and only if  there
    may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to go outside  them  is
    it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether  there
    are compelling circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised  under  the
    Rules.  In my view this case falls into that category.  While there  is
    no near miss argument for the Appellant the judge did make a finding at
    paragraph 13 in that the P60 produced shows an income of around ï¿½24,000
    in excess of the sum required under  the  Immigration  Rules.   As  the
    Sponsor put in his statement, he has never  claimed  any  benefits  and
    offers evidence that he is  able  to  support  the  Appellants  without
    recourse to public funds. It seems to me that these are  factors  which
    require to be considered under  Article  8.    I  have  concluded  that
    because the judge failed to make proper findings as to whether  or  not
    the marriage was subsisting at the date  of  decision  that  the  judge
    materially erred in law and I agree with Mr Alim that a  fresh  hearing
    is required to allow the credibility of parties to be fully assessed.

17. In saying that Mr Alim freely conceded that the Appellant did not  meet
    the terms of Appendix FM.  I make no findings  on  whether  or  not  in
    terms of Appendix  FM-SE-D  the  Secretary  of  State  was  obliged  to
    exercise  flexibility  and  consider  documents  submitted  after   the
    application was made - that will also be a matter for  the  First  tier
    Tribunal to determine.

18. In all the circumstances the determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    is set aside in its entirety. No findings of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    are to stand. Under Section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice
    Statement 7.2 the nature and extent of judicial fact finding  necessary
    for the decision to be remade is such that it is appropriate  to  remit
    the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

Decision

19. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

20. I set aside the decision.

21. I remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.
