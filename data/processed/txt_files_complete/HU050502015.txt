                                   Before

                                   Between

                            DOROTEA BELTRAN-BELL
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION TO SET ASIDE

1.   In light of the evidence now produced showing that  the  appellant  was
   granted entry clearance on 1  February  2017  and  that  her  appeal  was
   confirmed as withdrawn in a Notice of Withdrawal issued by the First-tier
   Tribunal on 9 March 2017, it is clear that the appeal  before  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Jones on 5 April 2017 was a nullity.

2.    On  the  basis  that  there  was  a  procedural  irregularity  in  the
   proceedings, in that Judge Jones was clearly unaware of the fact that the
   appeal had been withdrawn, his decision is hereby set aside under Rule 43
   of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

3.   The appeal is confirmed as withdrawn.
