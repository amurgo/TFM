Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Karim
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh  born  in  1987.   He  appeals
    against a decision of the Respondent made on  2  September  2015  under
    paragraph 322(2) of the Immigration Rules it being alleged  that  in  a
    previous application for leave on 30 October 2012 he submitted a  false
    TOEIC certificate.

 2. He also appeals against a decision made on 15  December  2015  refusing
    his application for a residence card.  It was refused  because  it  was
    concluded  that  his  marriage  to  a  Spanish  national  was  one   of
    convenience.

 3. Following a hearing at Taylor House on 9 September 2016  Judge  of  the
    First-tier I Ross dismissed both appeals.

 4. He dealt first with the residence card  case.   Having  heard  evidence
    from the Appellant and his EEA national  spouse  his  findings  are  at
    paragraphs 12 to 14.   In  summary,  he  found  their  evidence  to  be
    'inconsistent, vague and lacking in credibility'.  He found  it  to  be
    unlikely that the Appellant happened to be living away from home at  an
    address which was raided by immigration officers on  3  December  2015.
    Also that his wife was staying with a friend.

 5. The judge did not believe their evidence that they had moved out of the
    marital house because of a pest  infestation.   Inadequate  documentary
    evidence had been provided in that regard.

 6. The judge gave 'no weight' to a letter purporting to be from a flatmate
    of the Appellant and to letters from the parents of  his  wife  because
    their letters 'comprise wholly of self serving  statements  created  by
    the appellant'.

 7. The judge also noted inconsistencies between the Appellant and his wife
    in relation to the date of their engagement, and whether he bought  her
    a ring.

 8. Turning to the TOEIC case his findings are at paragraphs 23 to 26.   He
    concluded that the Respondent had discharged the evidential  burden  of
    establishing that the  Appellant  procured  his  TOEIC  certificate  by
    deception.  Having noted and  found  persuasive  the  generic  evidence
    submitted by the Respondent he went on to find the Appellant's evidence
    'unsatisfactory in several respects': he dealt with the taking  of  the
    test in September 2012 'in a vague and perfunctory way unable  to  name
    the college or give any meaningful description of it or of  the  taking
    of the test'.  The judge did not believe the claim that it was not  the
    Appellant who was named in the invalid test analysis document.

 9. He also found that the fact that the Appellant  may  be  proficient  in
    English did not assist in determining whether he or a  proxy  took  the
    test.  Nor did he have to determine what  the  Appellant's  motive  (or
    lack of) may have been.

10. He sought permission to appeal which was granted on 25 April 2017.

    Error of law hearing

11. At the error of law hearing Mr Karim made the following submissions  in
    respect of the EEA case: the evidential burden  to  justify  reasonable
    suspicion was back to front, this being with  the  Respondent  not  the
    Appellant  as  stated;  it  was  unfair  to  comment  on  an   unlikely
    coincidence for the Appellant to  be  absent  and  the  Sponsor  to  be
    staying with a friend when the house was  raided,  when  the  raid  was
    directed at a different person; it was unfair to comment  on  vagueness
    and inconsistency without identifying why and given  that  on  the  one
    hand there was no interview and on the other corroboration was provided
    including pest control evidence and letters  from  housemates  and  his
    wife's parents.  Also, he failed  to  consider  photographic  and  bank
    evidence which supported the claim that the relationship was genuine.

12. On the second case Mr Karim submitted that  the  judge  erred  when  he
    criticised the Appellant for not knowing the name of  the  test  centre
    when he specified this precisely in his witness  statement;  the  judge
    erroneously relied  upon  an  October  2012  CAS  referred  to  by  the
    Respondent when there was no such document, the only CAS produced being
    dated May 2013; he was also wrong to give a lack of credit for evidence
    of good English which would have made cheating at ETS otiose.

13. In reply Mr Tarlow's position was that the decisions were  sustainable.
    The judge had approached the issues correctly and  reached  conclusions
    that were open to him on the evidence.

    Conclusions

14. In considering this I look first at the EEA case.  I see  no  merit  in
    the claim that the judge reversed  the  burden  of  proof.   The  judge
    referred to Papajorgji (EEA spouse - marriage  of  convenience)  Greece
    [2012] UKUT 00038 at paragraph 6.  He states  'The  burden  of  proving
    that the marriage is one of convenience is on the respondent...There is
    an evidential burden on the Appellant to  address  evidence  justifying
    reasonable suspicion that the matter has  been  entered  into  for  the
    predominant purpose of securing residence rights'.  That  approach  was
    approved in Agho v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 1198 where  it  was  noted  (at
    [14]):

         'The UT in Papajorgji concluded at para 39

         "In summary, our understanding is that, where the issue  is  raised
         in an appeal, the question for the judge will therefore be  in  the
         light of the totality of the information before  me  including  the
         assessment of the claimant's answers and any information  provided,
         am I am satisfied that it is more probable than not that this is  a
         marriage of convenience"

         Consistently with the prior discussion,  that  clearly  places  the
         burden of proof on the Secretary of State (or ECO).'

15. In my judgment the judge properly applied the burden.

16. The problem with the judge's brief  findings  can  be  briefly  stated.
    Whilst it is not necessary for a judge to comment  on  every  piece  of
    evidence before him, in this case the judge failed to  have  regard  to
    significant  amounts  of  evidence  which  appeared  to   support   the
    Appellant's case.  In itself  he  was  entitled  to  conclude  that  an
    undated and uninformative note  by  a  pest  control  company  did  not
    advance the case, that little weight should be  given  to  letters  and
    that there were several inconsistencies between the Appellant  and  his
    wife in respect of the date of engagement, the length of engagement and
    whether he bought her  a  ring.   However,  he  made  no  reference  to
    photographs bearing to show the  couple  together,  to  claims  in  his
    statement that he was required by the officers to  show  them  intimate
    photographs of his wife which he  did,  reluctantly,  from  his  phone.
    Also, several bank documents which individually showed them at the same
    address (92 The Sandlings  London)  and  at  least  one  (Lloyds  Bank,
    Appellant's bundle (p92)) which is in joint names at that address.

17. In failing to pay heed to and give adequate reasons on material matters
    the judge erred.

18. As for the ETS case, which like the EEA case was dealt with briefly  by
    the judge I find error for the same reason.  It suffices  to  note  the
    following.  The judge found the Appellant's  oral  evidence  about  the
    taking of the test to be 'vague & perfunctory' he was 'unable  to  name
    the college or give any meaningful description of it or of  the  taking
    of the test'.  He appears not to have been  aware  of  the  Appellant's
    statement which was before him and where it stated, inter alia:

         'I attended the test in September 2012.  The test centre was  about
         15 minutes walking distance from my house where I used to  live  at
         the time and the centre used to be a college before,  the  name  of
         the college being Advance College. Before taking the exam I took  a
         3 day course and two mock tests from the college. I paid ï¿½300 which
         included the test fee and the 3 day course fee.'

19. Also, in his witness statement the Appellant referred to his  past  and
    post qualifications including IELTS and ACCA parts 1, 2, 3 which it  is
    claimed demonstrates his English language ability and lack  of  motive.
    He gave evidence in English. The judge found that he 'may be proficient
    in English...'[25]. In my judgement he was  wrong  to  find  that  such
    apparent proficiency necessarily did not assist in determining  whether
    he or a proxy took the test.

20. The judge should have had regard to SM and  Qadir  (ETS-Evidence-Burden
    of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229 during  the  course  of  which  the  Tribunal
    states: 'every case belonging to the ETS/TOEIC stable  will  invariably
    be fact sensitive.  To this we add that every appeal will be determined
    on the basis of the evidence adduced by the parties'.  Also,  in  Qadir
    [2016] EWCA Civ 1167 the court said that the UT was entitled  to  reach
    its conclusion on the English language ability of the claimant based on
    the evidence before them.

21.  The decisions of the First-tier Tribunal show material  error  of  law
    such that they are set aside. None of its findings are  to  stand.  The
    nature of the cases is such that it is appropriate in terms of  section
    12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice Statement 7.2 to remit  the
    case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing, not before Judge I Ross.

22. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
