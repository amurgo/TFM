Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr M Nadeem, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Miss A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are all citizens of Nepal.  The first Appellant was born
    on 11th May 1985, and the second and third Appellants are  respectively
    his wife and child being born on 25th  April  1986  and  22nd  February
    2017.  The Appellants sought leave to remain in the UK on the basis  of
    family and private life by way of an application  dated  20th  November
    2017.  That  application  recited  the  extensive  immigration  history
    beginning when the first Appellant was granted leave  valid  from  29th
    November 2007 as a student.  The Appellants' applications were  refused
    by Notice of Refusal dated 28th March 2018.

 2. The Appellants appealed and the appeals came before Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Swaniker sitting at Taylor House on  7th  November  2018.
    In a decision and reasons promulgated on 8th April 2019 the Appellants'
    appeals were dismissed on human rights grounds.

 3. On 22nd April 2019 Grounds of Appeal were lodged to the Upper Tribunal.
     On 14th May 2019 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal P J  M  Hollingworth
    granted permission to appeal.  That grant of  permission  is  extensive
    and runs to two pages albeit in one paragraph.  The judge refers to the
    test centre at West Link College not being in London where  the  second
    Appellant lived and it was not by her account in a place  or  area  she
    was familiar with.  Judge Hollingworth considered that it was  arguable
    given the lapse of time that the judge attached too much weight to that
    which the Appellant could  not  recollect  set  against  the  backcloth
    depicted by the judge and it was arguable  that  the  boundary  between
    inability  to  recall  and  evasiveness  has  not  been  lineated  with
    sufficient clarity set against the chronology.  Further  he  considered
    it was arguable that insufficient attention had been paid to the layout
    internally of the room in which the Appellant sat the test in  relation
    to the question  of  how  many  people  were  in  the  room  given  the
    methodology adopted at test centres to separate those taking the  tests
    and to making due allowance for the equipment required.  Therefore,  in
    granting permission the judge considered that it was arguable that  the
    weight attached by the judge to the factors identified at  the  opening
    of paragraph 24 was insufficient and it was arguable that the  analysis
    of  the  absence  of  a  satisfactory  rebuttal  of  the   Respondent's
    allegation of fraud was flawed.   Thereafter  he  considered  that  the
    approach towards credibility expressed by the judge may be erroneous.

 4. It is on this basis that  the  appeal  comes  before  me  to  determine
    whether or not there is a material error of law in the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge.  The Appellants appear by  their  instructed
    Counsel Mr Nadeem.  Mr Nadeem is very familiar with this matter  having
    appeared before the First-tier Tribunal.  The second Appellant is  also
    in attendance.  She fully understands the proceedings and presented  as
    an articulate and intelligent person.  Mr Nadeem appears on  behalf  of
    all three Appellants.  The Secretary of  State  appeared  by  her  Home
    Office Presenting Officer Miss Fijiwala.

Submissions/Discussion

 5. Mr Nadeem points out that it is for a Tribunal to assess whether or not
    an Appellant can speak a language.  He reminds me at paragraph  22  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  found  that  in  the  light  of  the  second
    Appellant's  fluency/command  of  the  English  language  during   oral
    evidence and external/objective evidence, namely the production of  her
    academic qualifications, there was a prima facie case that she did  not
    use a proxy to take her TOEIC test.  He reminds me  that  her  academic
    qualifications consist of an award from Sunderland University in  April
    2013 graduating with a Masters Degree in Business  Administration,  the
    Association  of  Business   Practitioners   Postgraduate   Diploma   in
    Management Studies which was awarded in April 2012 and the  Institution
    of Administration Management Diploma awarded in 2011 after successfully
    passing each of the three relevant levels.  Further he points out  that
    the British Council endorsed IELTS certificates  awarded  in  2008  and
    that all these courses were taught in English.

 6. It is his submission the  judge  at  paragraph  22  fails  to  consider
    material evidence pointing out that  the  Institute  of  Administrative
    Management Diploma was sufficient to  secure  her  admission  onto  the
    degree programme and that notwithstanding  this  the  second  Appellant
    submitted her TOEIC certificate with her application for  an  extension
    of her visa.  He submits that it begs the question  why  the  Appellant
    would  have  submitted  her  TOEIC  certificate  with  her  immigration
    application if indeed she had acquired it by deception  and  that  this
    was a material consideration and the one that favours  her  credibility
    that she did not use a proxy.  He reminds me that when the  Appellant's
    leave decision was certified she sought to challenge  this  by  way  of
    judicial review and did not decide to pack up her bags and leave the UK
    and that the only  reason  why  her  judicial  review  application  was
    refused was because at the time, the law as it stood, did not allow for
    an in-country right of appeal.  He submits that the judge has failed to
    provide a proper analysis of the Appellant's credibility.

 7. He further submits  that  the  second  Appellant  had  not  misled  the
    Tribunal with regard to the test centre merely stating that  she  could
    not remember and that this is hardly surprising bearing in mind that it
    was seven years since she had been in the centre.  He reminds  me  that
    the Appellant only put her TOEIC certificate in  with  her  papers  for
    completion of documentation and that it was not necessary for her to do
    so as it was not needed.  Thereafter he points out she spent ï¿½1,000  on
    judicial review as she wanted to  clear  her  name  but  this  was  not
    considered by the judge.  He submits that there are material errors  of
    law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge in that the  judge
    failed to consider material evidence and that the judge had  failed  to
    give any consideration of this fact even to the extent that  it  was  a
    mitigation bearing in mind the length of  time  that  had  passed.   Mr
    Nadeem submits that the Appellant was being honest and that this  is  a
    question of balance which the judge has failed to approach.

 8. So far as the  reference  the  judge  makes  at  paragraph  23  to  the
    appellant's demeanour is concerned he rejects that and reminds me  that
    this is a judge that has taken  some  five  months  to  promulgate  his
    decision.  He submits there are material errors of law  and  that  this
    case needs reconsideration and he asked me to  remit  it  back  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for rehearing with none of the findings of fact  to
    stand.

 9. In brief response Miss Fijiwala submits  that  what  has  been  put  is
    merely a disagreement and that the judge has  taken  into  account  the
    oral evidence.  She refers me to paragraph 8 of the decision  and  that
    the Appellant had been advised that she should provide  the  TOEIC  and
    that the burden of proof fell  upon  her.   She  further  submits  that
    paragraphs 23 to 25 of the judge's decision set out  why  her  evidence
    had not been accepted.  The judge she submits concluded this was not an
    innocent explanation and that there had been an attempt to mislead  the
    Tribunal.  She asked me to dismiss the appeal.

The Law

10.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

11. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings on Error of Law

12. As a starting point I take into account the fact  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge for reasons unknown to me took  nearly  five  months  to
    produce his decision.  Guidance has been given on  this  point  by  the
    Court of Appeal in The Queen on the application  of  SS  (Sr  Lanka)  v
    Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2018]  EWCA  Civ  1391.
    Therein Lord Justice Leggatt comments that where the credibility of  an
    Appellant is in issue, there is no such Rule that a delay of more  than
    three months between the hearing of oral evidence and the date  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal's decision renders the decision unsafe and that the
    correct approach is to ask whether the delay has caused the decision to
    be unsafe so that it would be unjust to let it stand.  So far  as  that
    aspect of this appeal is concerned I  do  not  consider  the  delay  in
    promulgating alone would be  sufficient  to  show  that  there  is  any
    material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    albeit that the Tribunal is entitled to be  critical  of  a  judge  who
    without explanation, has taken as  long  as  this  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge has to produce his determination.

13. The question arises as to whether or not therefore the  judge  in  this
    decision has reached findings on  credibility  which  contain  material
    errors of law.  I have heard, albeit not in oral  testimony,  from  the
    second Appellant and it is clear both from her academic  qualifications
    and having heard her speak that she would on the face of it  appear  to
    speak and understand English very well.  It does beg the question as to
    why she would even contemplate admitting a false TOEIC certificate.   A
    proper approach to credibility  would  require  an  assessment  of  the
    evidence and of the general claim.  In asylum claims  relevant  factors
    are firstly  the  internal  consistency  of  the  claim,  secondly  the
    inherent plausibility of the claim and thirdly the consistency  of  the
    claim with external factors of the sought typically  found  in  country
    guidance.  Theoretically I acknowledge that it is correct  that  all  a
    claimant need do is to state his claim but that claim still needs to be
    examined for consistency and inherent plausibility and in nearly  every
    case as here external information against  which  the  claim  could  be
    checked would be available.  In this case such information would be the
    documentary evidence provided  by  the  second  Appellant  both  as  to
    academic qualifications - which have been produced - and  the  evidence
    she produced on her judicial review albeit that that  was  aborted  for
    legal reasons.

14. Grounds given by  the  judge  indicate  criticism  of  the  Appellant's
    demeanour.  This is of  course  a  factor  which  may  well  have  been
    recorded by him in his notes to which I am not privy but that apart  it
    has still taken him some five months to recall call such factors in his
    decision.  In addition, it seems strange to accept that the failure  by
    an intelligent and articulate  Appellant  to  be  able  to  recall  the
    internal structure of the test centre being  evidence  that  should  be
    held against her.

15.  I  agree  with  the  approach  adopted  when  granting  permission  by
    Immigration  Judge  Hollingworth  in  that  the  boundary  between  the
    inability  to  recall  and  evasiveness  has  not  been  created   with
    sufficient clarity set against  the  chronology  and  that  the  weight
    attached by the judge to the  factors  identified  at  the  opening  of
    paragraph 25 are insufficient as are the matters referred  to  in  this
    context at paragraph 25 to the extent that too  much  weight  has  been
    attached to what was described as a failure/omission.  The end  product
    of such analysis is that the Respondent's allegation in the absence  of
    satisfactory rebuttal is flawed  and  the  approach  of  the  judge  to
    credibility is also flawed.

16. In such circumstances there are material errors of law in the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal Judge and in the interests of  fairness  and
    justice the correct approach is to set aside the decision and remit the
    matter back to the First-tier Tribunal with none  of  the  findings  of
    fact to stand.
