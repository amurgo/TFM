Representation:
Appellant   Miss Harris, Counsel, instructed by Farani Javid
      Taylor Solicitors LLP
Respondent  Ms Johnstone (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who entered the  United  Kingdom
    on April 6, 2006 as a student with leave until August 30, 2008. On June
    30, 2008 his leave was extended as a participant of  the  International
    Graduate Scheme until June 30, 2009. On June 17, 2009  he  was  granted
    leave as a Tier 1 post study migrant until June 30, 2010  and  on  July
    12, 2010 he was granted leave as a Tier  4  student  until  August  17,
    2011. On August 16, 2011 he applied to extend his  stay  as  a  tier  4
    student but the respondent refused this application on  June  18,  2014
    under paragraph 322(1A) HC 395 and on the basis the  Immigration  Rules
    were not met. At the same time a decision was taken to  remove  him  by
    way of directions under section  47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The appellant appealed that decision on July  18,  2014  under  section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 3. The matter came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Fox on  October
    24, 2014 and in a decision promulgated on October 30, 2014  he  refused
    the appellant's appeal finding he failed to satisfy the requirements of
    the Immigration Rules although he found the  appellant  had  not  acted
    dishonestly.

 4. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on November 18, 2014  submitting
    the FtTJ had erred by placing the burden of proof on the appellant  and
    by finding the appellant's appeal failed due to deception.

 5. On January 12, 2015 Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Cheales  gave
    permission to appeal finding the FtTJ's conclusions  were  unclear  and
    that he had not given clear reasons for his decision.

 6. The matter came before me on  the  above  date  and  the  parties  were
    represented as set out above. The appellant was in attendance.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

 7. Miss Harris argued that the FtTJ erred because  he  should  never  have
    required the appellant to prove anything because the evidence of  fraud
    was based on poor evidence. There was no evidence of dishonesty and the
    FtTJ should not have found the bank  document  was  a  forgery  because
    there was nothing on the document that suggested it was a forgery. Miss
    Harris did accept that if the FtTJ's finding on the document was upheld
    there was no evidence that demonstrated the financial requirements were
    met.

 8. Ms Johnstone adopted the Rule 24 letter  dated  January  19,  2015  and
    submitted Miss Harris's submissions had no  merit.  The  appellant  had
    accepted in his grounds of appeal, statement and oral evidence that the
    bank statement was false and the  FtTJ  was  entitled  to  accept  this
    concession because the appellant knew the documents were false.  Whilst
    the FtTJ accepted the appellant had not acted dishonestly he  had  also
    found the appellant had not satisfied the Rules and as at today's  date
    he had still not provided  any  evidence  that  he  met  the  financial
    requirements at the date of his application.

    DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

 9. I have reviewed the papers and in particular the grounds of appeal, the
    appellant's witness statement and the FtTJ's  determination  and  asked
    Miss Harris why this argument was now being raised when  it  was  clear
    from the above documents that this was  not  something  that  had  been
    raised prior to this hearing.  Miss  Harris  submitted  that  the  FtTJ
    should  not  have  accepted  the  appellant's  concession  because  the
    respondent had  failed  to  provide  adequate  evidence  to  prove  the
    statement was a forgery.

10. I referred Miss Harris  to  the  original  grounds  of  appeal  and  in
    particular paragraphs [10] and [11]. At paragraph  [10]  the  appellant
    accepted he had  been  naï¿½ve  and  that  a  forged  document  had  been
    submitted without his knowledge and at  paragraph  [11]  the  appellant
    claimed he had the funds in  another  bank  account.  Miss  Harris  had
    already conceded that there were no bank statements before the Tribunal
    that demonstrated the appellant met the financial requirements and  she
    also had to accept that the appellant accepted he was  aware  a  forged
    statement had been used.

11. I suggested to Miss Harris that if she was now seeking  to  argue  that
    the respondent had not proved the statement was a forgery then this was
    an argument that should have been the cornerstone  of  the  grounds  of
    appeal, his statement and oral evidence. The bank  statement  concerned
    was a UK bank statement and it had been open to the appellant to  bring
    the matter to the attention of the respondent and  submit  the  correct
    statement.

12. The appellant's witness statement was a rehash of the grounds of appeal
    and the FtTJ recorded in his determination at paragraph [11]  that  the
    appellant accepted the agent had provided fraudulent documents.

13. Whilst the FtTJ never referred to the burden of proof on the respondent
    this was not material for two reasons:

          a. The FtTJ accepted the respondent had not acted dishonestly.

          b.  The  appellant  had  failed  to  provide  the  required  bank
             statement and could not meet the Rules in any event.

14. Miss Harris argued that paragraph [14] of  the  determination  did  not
    make clear on what basis the appeal had been refused. I disagreed  with
    her submission because the FtTJ made clear in this statement-

         "I am satisfied that the  agent  acted  entirely  unilaterally  and
         independently of the appellant and the bank statements submitted on
         behalf of the appellant by his agent were forged. This was  out  of
         his control... It would be wrong in my view for the  respondent  to
         hold an allegation of dishonestly against this appellant  in  light
         of the facts established in this case."

15. This statement makes clear  that  the  appeal  was  not  refused  under
    paragraph 322(1A) HC 395. The FtTJ also made clear in paragraph [14] of
    his determination that the appellant had been  free  to  make  a  fresh
    application  with  the  correct  documents  and  bank  statements.  The
    appellant did not and as has already been conceded there  are  no  bank
    statements that demonstrate he met the Rules. Whilst the FtTJ  did  not
    make clear the basis of refusal I am satisfied  this  is  not  material
    because the appellant never demonstrated he could meet the Rules.

16. The respondent's delay in taking almost three years to  deal  with  the
    application was a disgrace but it had been open  to  the  appellant  to
    rectify  the  problem  and  submit  the  correct  documents   with   an
    explanation. He chose not to and is  now  left  with  the  refusal  and
    dismissal of his appeal  on  the  grounds  he  failed  to  satisfy  the
    financial requirements laid out in Appendix C of the Immigration Rules.



17. I dismiss the appellant's appeal.

    DECISION

18. There was no material error. The original decision is upheld.

19. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I see no reason to alter that order.
