                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. On 20 September 2019 I wrote to the parties as follows:

         "I have reviewed the file in this case.

         Permission was granted by a lengthy decision amounting in effect to
         the expression of serious  concerns  that  the  judge  insisted  in
         proceeding with the hearing despite evidence of the possibility  of
         representation  being  provided  soon,  and  of   the   appellant's
         vulnerability.  The appellant is in detention.

         I propose to set the determination  aside  for  error  of  law  and
         direct rehearing by the First-tier Tribunal without more ado.

         Any submissions to the contrary  will  be  considered  if  received
         within 14 days of the date of this letter."

 2. No response has been received.

 3. I now set aside the decision of Judge Sullivan for  error  of  law  and
    direct that the appellant's appeal be determined afresh by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.




                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                              IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBER
                                                      Date: 16 October 2019.
