For the Respondent:    Mr Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside by order  of
    Upper Tribunal Judge Storey. The resumed hearing came before me in  the
    Upper Tribunal on 7 September 2015.  Following a brief discussion  with
    the representatives, I decided that the decision in the  appeal  should
    be remade in the First-tier Tribunal and  not  the  Upper  Tribunal.  I
    direct accordingly that the appeal  be  listed  forthwith  for  hearing
    before a judge of the First-tier Tribunal. None of the findings of fact
    shall stand.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal having been set  aside  by  decision
of Upper Tribunal Judge Storey, this appeal is remitted  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal for that Tribunal to remake the decision.  None of the findings  of
fact shall stand.



Note: I regret that an administrative accident unfortunately has led to  the
delay in the promulgation of this decision.


Signed                              Date 10 October 2016

Upper Tribunal Judge Clive Lane
