For the Appellant:     Mr A. Maqsood, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr I. Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born  on  26th  July  1988.   He
    appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 3rd April  2014  to
    refuse his application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom  as  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  His appeal was  allowed  at  the  first
    instance by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Ross sitting  at  Richmond
    on 22nd October 2014.  The Respondent appeals with leave  against  that
    decision.  For the reasons which I have set out below, I have  set  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside and have remade the  decision
    on the appeal in this case.  Thus although the matter  comes  initially
    before me as an appeal by the Respondent, for the sake of convenience I
    will continue to refer to the parties  as  they  were  known  at  first
    instance.

2.   The Appellant entered the  United  Kingdom  with  leave  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student on 2nd October 2010 valid until 30th January 2012. On
    13th March 2012 he was granted further leave to remain this time  as  a
    Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant valid until 13th March 2014.  On  13th
    March 2014 before his last leave was due to expire he made the  present
    application for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant  the
    refusal of which has given rise to these proceedings.

The Application

3.   The  Appellant's  application  was  that  he  and  another  citizen  of
    Pakistan Mr Shoaib Irfan operated a  business  in  the  United  Kingdom
    called Zash Solutions Ltd ("Zash").  Zash described itself as a company
    of IT and telecom specialists providing services to customers.

4.   In order to succeed the Appellant and his team member had  to  be  able
    to score 75 points under Appendix A  for  Attributes  and  provide  the
    specified documents.  This was broken up into three  parts,  25  points
    for access to at least �50,000 by way of funds, 25 points for the funds
    to be held in a regulated financial institution(s) and  25  points  for
    the funds to be  disposable  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The  Appellant
    produced the following evidence in support of his application:

    (i)  a bank statement from Barclays dated 13th March 2014 in  the  name
         of Mrs Sumaira Manzoor showing a balance of �42,327.32;

    (ii) a declaration from Mrs Manzoor dated 11th March 2014 stating  that
         she had �40,000 in her account and would make it  available  to  Mr
         Irfan and the  Appellant  and/or  Zash.   The  money  would  remain
         available to them until it was transferred  to  them  and/or  their
         business.

    (iii)    letters from Arthur & Co Solicitors attesting to Mrs Manzoor's
         signature and from Lennons Solicitors to the same effect.

     In order to reach the figure of �50,000 required under  the  Rules  the
    Appellant produced evidence to show that �10,713.04  was  held  in  the
    name of Zash and when added to the money held by Mrs Manzoor the  total
    came to more than the �50,000 required.

5.   After posting the applications for  Mr  Irfan  and  the  Appellant  the
    Appellant's solicitors Maxim Law wrote a letter to  the  Respondent  on
    13th March 2014 stating that Mrs Manzoor had not been  able  to  obtain
    the specified bank letter from Barclays Bank as "Barclays has a  policy
    of not issuing any customised letters as required  by  the  Immigration
    Rules therefore no Barclays customer can obtain a  letter  outside  the
    set templates of Barclays". The solicitors requested the Respondent  to
    consider the alternative documents provided with the application  under
    the evidential flexibility policy or to request or to contact  Barclays
    directly for such a letter and obtain it under what was referred to  as
    the Respondent's "statutory powers".

The Explanation for Refusal

6.   The Respondent refused both applications of Mr Irfan and the  Appellant
    on 3rd April 2014.  Mrs Manzoor's bank statement was not acceptable  as
    the account was not in  the  name  of  the  Appellant  as  required  by
    paragraph 41-SD(c)(ii)(4) of Appendix A which states:

         "The account must be in the applicant's  own  name  only  (or  both
         names for an entrepreneurial team) or where it is a  joint  account
         with the applicant's spouse, civil partner or partner  set  out  in
         paragraph 53 below, not in the name of a business or third party."

7.   No letter from the financial institution in which Mrs  Manzoor's  funds
    were held was supplied to establish that those funds were accessible to
    the Appellant's business as specified under  paragraph  41-SD(c)(i)  of
    Appendix A.  This latter provision states  that  the  letter  from  the
    financial institution holding the funds must be  an  original  document
    not a copy; be on the institution's headed paper; have been  issued  by
    an authorised official of that institution; have been  produced  within
    the three months immediately before the date  of  application;  confirm
    that the institution is regulated by the appropriate  body;  state  the
    applicant's name and his team partner's name where relevant;  show  the
    account number and state the date  of  the  document  and  confirm  the
    amount of money available from the applicant's own funds if  applicable
    that are held  in  that  institution;  confirm  that  the  third  party
    [Sponsor] has informed the  institution  of  the  amount  of  money  he
    intends to make available and that the institution is not aware of  the
    third party having promised to make that money available to  any  other
    person; confirm the name of each third party and their contact details.

8.   The letter from Lennon Solicitors was not  acceptable  as  it  did  not
    state either the Appellant's or Mr Irfan's name and did not confirm the
    number, place of issue and dates of issue and expiry of  Mrs  Manzoor's
    identity document.  The Respondent rejected the  monies  held  by  Zash
    because of the wording of subparagraph  (c)(ii)  which  I  have  quoted
    above.

9.   If funds were held in a business bank account evidence that  the  funds
    had  already  been  invested  was  required.   The  Appellant  had  not
    submitted the specified evidence as listed under paragraph 41-SD and 46-
    SD to establish that he had access to the funds he was claiming.  Where
    monies invested in the business were in the form of a  director's  loan
    that must be shown in the relevant set  of  accounts  together  with  a
    legal agreement between the applicant and company showing the terms  of
    the loan (paragraph 46-SD(a)(iii)).

10.  The Respondent considered her discretion under paragraph 245AA  of  the
    Immigration  Rules  whether  to  request  additional  documentation  or
    exceptionally consider the application  under  that  paragraph.    This
    provides that where the Rules state that specified  documents  must  be
    provided the Respondent will only consider  documents  that  have  been
    submitted  with  the  application  and  will  only  consider  documents
    submitted after the application in certain circumstances for example if
    the applicant has submitted specified documents: (i) in which  some  of
    the documents in a sequence have been omitted for example if  one  bank
    statement from a series is missing; (ii) a document  is  in  the  wrong
    format for example if  a  letter  is  not  on  a  letterhead  paper  as
    specified; (iii) a document is a copy  and  not  an  original;  (iv)  a
    document does not contain all of the specified information.   In  those
    circumstances  the  Respondent  may  contact  the  applicant   or   his
    representative in writing and request the correct documents.  Documents
    will not be requested where the Respondent  does  not  anticipate  that
    addressing the omission or error will  lead  to  a  grant  because  the
    application will be refused for other reasons.

11.  Under subparagraph (d) if  the  applicant  has  submitted  a  specified
    document in the wrong format, which is a copy or does not  contain  all
    of the specified information but the missing information is  verifiable
    from other documents submitted with the application or  an  appropriate
    website the application  may  be  granted  exceptionally  provided  the
    Respondent is satisfied that the specified documents  are  genuine  and
    the applicant meets all the other requirements. The Respondent  decided
    against tasking for more information as it  was  not  anticipated  that
    addressing the omission or error in the documentation would lead  to  a
    grant of leave.

12.  As the Appellant could not show access to  funds  the  Respondent  also
    refused to award any points for funds held  in  a  regulated  financial
    institution or funds disposable in the United Kingdom,  the  Respondent
    in effect taking the view that there were no monies available.  As  the
    Appellant had not demonstrated  access  to  funds  she  was  unable  to
    accurately assess either of the two remaining Attributes.

The Appeal

13.  The Appellant lodged an appeal against that decision but  as  Mr  Irfan
    (according to Maxim Law) did not have a statutory right of  appeal  the
    solicitors wrote to the  Respondent  on  23rd  April  2014  asking  the
    Respondent to reconsider her refusal.  The letter stated:

         "Following filling in of the application forms on  7th  March  2013
         there was change of  circumstances  within  the  above  applicant's
         business i.e. Zash Solutions  Ltd  whereby  the  Appellant  had  to
         invest �10,000 in their business which they did on 12th March  2014
         and with a view to this change, the specified documents in Appendix
         A were posted to you on 13th March 2014 after the applications  had
         been posted that morning.  There seems to be  no  record  of  these
         documents in the refusal letters and we  attach  a  copy  of  those
         documents now for your attention.  We understand that had this post
         been taken into account there would not have been an  issue  as  to
         the investment of �10,000.  We therefore request you to  reconsider
         the evidence received in support of the above applications."

14.   The  letter  submitted  that  the  correspondence  from  Arthur  &  Co
    Solicitors and Lennons Solicitors did meet the requirements of Appendix
    A but if there was a minor error it  was  correctable  under  paragraph
    245AA(b)(vi).  The letter repeated the point that Barclay's policy  was
    not to issue customised letters and their set templates did not include
    all the information required by Appendix  A.  The  Respondent  had  not
    exercised her discretion, the decision was not in accordance  with  the
    law and breached the Appellant's human rights.

The Hearing at the First Instance

15.  The Judge heard evidence from the Appellant  and  his  team  member  Mr
    Irfan.  It  was  argued  that  the  refusal  letter  had  confused  the
    requirements  of  the   third   party   declaration   and   the   legal
    representatives' letters.  Notification of an allotment  of  shares  of
    �10,000 in Zash was sent to the Respondent in the letter of 13th  March
    2014.  Mr Irfan told the Judge that he had been issued with a residence
    card on 31st July  2014  valid  until  31st  July  2017  as  a  Tier  1
    Entrepreneur.  His first application had  been  rejected  (as  had  the
    Appellant's) but he had made a second application although he  had  not
    provided any new documents relating to the third  party  funding.   The
    day-to-day manager of the company was the Appellant.

16.  At paragraph 13 of his determination the Judge  directed  himself  that
    he might only consider evidence which was submitted in support  of  and
    at the time of the application.  "However it is well  established  that
    the period of the application is not closed until the decision has been
    made".  (I pause to note here that in stating this the Judge appears to
    have overlooked the Supreme Court decision of Patel).  The  Judge  held
    that the further documents referred to were sent to the Respondent even
    though the Respondent had no record of having received them.

17.  In relation to  Mrs  Manzoor's  bank  statement  the  Judge  stated  at
    paragraph 15 of his determination:

         "I consider that this does comply with the Rules because in respect
         of English bank accounts there is no  requirement  to  specifically
         state that the money is available to the applicant and in any event
         Barclays Bank are not prepared to make this declaration which is in
         the circumstances entirely meaningless since they did not know what
         is in the mind of a client in relation to the investment of  funds,
         their role is purely to look after the  money  for  her  until  she
         decides to spend it."

18.  In relation to the balance of �10,000 which the Appellant had  to  show
    the Judge wrote at paragraph 16:

         "The remaining �10,000 balance is held in the bank account  in  the
         name of Zash  Solutions  Ltd.   The  Appellant  has  now  submitted
         accounts from his accountant showing that this money  was  invested
         in the company by way of shares.  Since Zash Solutions Ltd  is  the
         name of the company which the Appellant is intending to run  as  an
         entrepreneur in the UK  I  consider  that  the  Appellant  has  now
         satisfied the requirements of the Rules and the appeal is allowed."

The Onward Appeal

19.  The Respondent appealed against this decision arguing  that  the  Judge
    had made a material misdirection of law.  The case  of  Durrani  [2014]
    UKUT 295 had held that there was no difficulty in the third party  bank
    with its customer's consent expressing its understanding based  on  the
    customer's  instructions  that  the  use  of  specified  funds  in  the
    customer's bank accounts is contemplated or proposed  by  the  customer
    for the purpose of financing the applicant's proposed business venture.
     Accordingly there was no substance in the argument that  the  relevant
    requirements contained in paragraph 41-SD(a)(i) produce the same result
    and must therefore be interpreted in some other manner.

20.  The Judge had erred in finding that a letter from Barclays  Bank  would
    be entirely meaningless and was not required as the funds  were  to  be
    held in a UK bank account.  Further the Judge had  considered  evidence
    in the form of accounts from  a  firm  of  accountants  that  were  not
    submitted with the application.  He was prevented from  doing  this  by
    Section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  which
    provides  that  the  Tribunal  may  consider  evidence  adduced  by  an
    Appellant only if it was submitted in support of and  at  the  time  of
    making the application to which the immigration  decision  related.  It
    applies where the immigration decision appealed  against  concerned  an
    application of a kind identified in the Immigration Rules as  requiring
    to be considered under the points based system. There is  an  exception
    for evidence which is adduced to prove that a document  is  genuine  or
    valid.

21.  The application for permission came on  the  papers  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Nicholson on 18th December 2014.  In granting permission
    to appeal he wrote:

         "Exception 2 of Section 85A restricted the Judge  to  consideration
         of evidence adduced by the Appellant in support of and at the  time
         of making the application.  Since it is arguable that at  paragraph
         16 the Judge considered (and placed material reliance on) a  letter
         from accountants which was not submitted with the application it is
         arguable that the Judge erred in law.   Permission  is  accordingly
         granted on  this  ground.   I  do  not  refuse  permission  on  the
         remaining grounds."

    Directions were sent to the parties following this grant  which  stated
    that the parties should prepare for  the  forthcoming  hearing  on  the
    basis that if the Upper Tribunal decided to set aside the determination
    of the First-tier Tribunal any further evidence including supplementary
    oral evidence that the Upper Tribunal might  need  to  consider  if  it
    decides to remake the decision should be available to be considered  at
    that hearing.

The Error of Law Stage

22.  When the matter came before me I had  to  decide  in  the  first  place
    whether there was an error of law such that the decision of the  First-
    tier should be set aside and the decision remade.  For  the  Respondent
    reliance  was  placed  on  the  decision  of  Durrani  the   evidential
    requirements had to be complied with as set out in  the  Rules.   There
    was nothing perverse about the requirements in the Rules as to what the
    documentation from the bank  should  provide.   If  the  provisions  of
    Appendix A were perverse the remedy would be by way of judicial  review
    not an appeal to the Tribunal.

23.  In reply for the Appellant it was conceded  that  paragraph  41-SD  did
    require a letter from the bank and not just a bank statement.   However
    there was a difficulty in obtaining such a letter from the  bank.   The
    case  of  Durrani  had  been  raised  at  the  hearing   but   it   was
    distinguishable from the present  case  as  the  Appellant  could  have
    relied on the provisions of paragraph 245AA.   The  same  documentation
    was again provided by Mr Irfan in his application in July 2014 when  he
    was granted Tier 1 leave to remain. He had used the  same  letter  from
    Barclays that the Appellant had produced (and which the Respondent  had
    rejected) which said they could not provide  the  kind  of  information
    required by the Rules.  It was therefore open  to  the  Judge  find  an
    inconsistency in the Respondent's decision making that Mr  Irfan  could
    be found to meet the Rules whereas the Appellant could not.

24.  The Sponsor obtained a (post decision) letter addressed  to  her  dated
    24th April 2014 from Barclays Bank, Chesham Branch  which  stated  that
    "We are unable  to  provide  details  to  yourself  of  the  customer's
    intentions of what they will do with the funds held in their  own  bank
    account".  The Judge had exercised his discretion under paragraph 245AA
    which the Respondent could have exercised to admit the evidence.

25.  Having heard these submissions I found that there was an error  of  law
    in the Judge's determination such that it fell to be  set  aside.   The
    Judge  had  relied  on  documents  produced  after  the  date  of   the
    application which he was not permitted to do. He was wrong  in  law  to
    find that the bank account of Mrs Manzoor complied with the Rules as he
    mistakenly believed that there was no requirement  to  state  that  the
    money was available to the applicant, alternatively such a  requirement
    was meaningless.  The case of Durrani had effectively dealt  with  that
    argument and it was not in my view distinguishable on  its  facts  from
    the instant case before the Judge.  I therefore set aside the  decision
    at first instance and enquired whether in those  circumstances  it  was
    intended  that  the  Appellant  would  give  any  oral  evidence.   The
    Appellant's solicitor stated that oral evidence would not  be  of  much
    assistance in this  case  and  the  matter  would  proceed  by  way  of
    submissions.

The Re-hearing

26.  I heard submissions first  from  the  Appellant's  representative  then
    from the Respondent then finally from the  Appellant's  representative.
    Confirmation that Mr Irfan  had  been  granted  a  residence  card  was
    contained in the Appellant's  bundle.   The  Appellant  had  drawn  the
    Respondent's attention to the fact that Barclays could not provide  the
    specified  information  and  therefore  discretion  should  have   been
    exercised under paragraph 245AA.  That was the only explanation how the
    Appellant's Tier 1 team member, Mr Irfan ,  could  have  been  granted.
    The Appellant did not know the process under which discretion had  been
    exercised in favour of Mr Irfan  and  the  Tribunal  was  requested  to
    adjourn the case in order  for  the  Respondent  to  provide  documents
    showing how Mr Irfan's application had  been  allowed.  I  declined  to
    adjourn. Directing  myself  that  the  test  was  one  of  fairness,  I
    considered that the Appellant had had ample time to obtain any  further
    evidence he might need (including making requests of  the  Respondent).
    The decision in favour of Mr Irfan had been known for a very long time.



27.  The Presenting Officer argued that the Appellant's submissions  had  no
    weight whatsoever.  The letter from Barclays Bank dated 24th April 2014
    postdated the refusal  by  21  days.   The  letter  was  therefore  not
    admissible, see the case of Raju.  The argument as  to  the  effect  of
    paragraph 245AA was also wrong.  Discretion would only be exercised  to
    grant an application where information could be verified from somewhere
    else.  None of the information required in this case was verifiable and
    even if the Respondent had tried to exercise discretion that would  not
    have been possible.  If the Respondent had asked for  information  from
    Barclays she would have received the same response that Mrs Manzoor had
    received.  Paragraph 245AA did not require the Respondent to  go  on  a
    Fact-Finding Mission for the benefit of the Appellant (see Rodriguez in
    the Court of Appeal).

28.  It was evident  from  the  wording  of  the  refusal  letter  that  the
    Respondent had had regard to her discretion under paragraph  245AA  but
    had decided not to ask for further documentation.

29.  The argument that Mr Irfan was granted leave but the Appellant was  not
    was only relevant in the context of any claim  under  Article  8.   The
    Appellant had  to  show  something  compelling  about  his  case.   The
    allegation was that his team member had been granted leave on the  same
    facts as his case.  However there could only  be  a  finding  that  the
    Respondent's decision was not in accordance with the law if it could be
    shown that there  was  systemic  inconsistency  by  the  Respondent  in
    decision making, see the case of Nasim.  Given the very large number of
    applications which the Respondent had to deal with during the course of
    a year it was inevitable that some inconsistency  was  bound  to  occur
    within the system and that was recognised by the judicial  authorities.
    To show a systemic inconsistency the Appellant would  have  to  make  a
    freedom of information request as was done in the Nasim case.  In Nasim
    the Appellant's Counsel had referred to the cases of two people who had
    been granted leave where an Appellant had not.  That was  held  not  to
    place a burden  on  the  Respondent  to  show  that  the  decision  was
    rational.  It did not expose systemic inconsistency.

30.  In conclusion the Appellant's representatives stated  that  the  letter
    from Barclays Bank of  24th  April  2014  was  not  enclosed  with  the
    application  but  was  sent  to  the  Respondent.   The  document   was
    admissible under Section 85A  by  reason  of  subsection  (4)(c)  which
    states that evidence postdecision may be considered if adduced to prove
    that a document is genuine or valid.   Discretion  in  the  Appellant's
    case should have been exercised in the same manner as was exercised  in
    the team member's Mr Irfan's case.  It was not just that the two  cases
    were alike, they were in fact the team members which enabled this  case
    to be differentiated from decisions such as Nasim.   Here  it  was  not
    about two totally independent cases but about the same application.  No
    submissions were made in relation to Article 8.

Findings

31.  The Appellant and his team member had to show that they had  access  to
    �50,000 in funds in order to be granted  leave  to  remain  as  Tier  1
    Entrepreneurs.  The Appellant proposed to do this by showing a  sum  in
    excess of �40,000 held by Mrs Manzoor and a sum in excess of �10,000 in
    the business, Zash.

32.  The difficulty was that the documentation submitted  by  the  Appellant
    with his application went nowhere near to showing either of  these  two
    sources of funds.  The �40,000 held  by  Mrs  Manzoor  was  held  in  a
    Barclays Bank account but there was no indication that  the  money  was
    available to the Appellant.  The requirement that  evidence  should  be
    produced to show  that  money  is  available  to  a  would  be  Tier  1
    Entrepreneur is not irrational.  The mischief it is  aimed  against  is
    that an applicant might show that a third party has funds without there
    ever being any possibility that the applicant  would  be  able  to  use
    those funds for the applicant's business.

33.  Banks are reluctant to spell out the terms  on  which  their  customers
    are holding money but as the case of  Durrani  points  out  it  is  not
    impossible for them to do so. The requirement in the Rules  is  neither
    absurd nor irrational.  It was acknowledged  that  the  bank  statement
    submitted with the application did not satisfy the requirement  of  the
    Rules but neither did the letter dated 24th April 2014  from  Barclays.
    There were two problems with it, firstly it was  too  late  because  it
    postdated  the  decision  and  secondly  it  still  did  not  give  the
    information required by the Rules.

34.  The Respondent (who only had the bank statement  from  Barclays  before
    her) decided that there was little to be gained from writing to request
    further information as the original application fell so  far  short  of
    what was required.  There was indeed no  purpose  to  be  served.   The
    Respondent was aware of her discretion but it was open to  her  not  to
    request further documentation or consider the application  outside  the
    Rules.  There was nothing unlawful about the Respondent's decision.

35.  The Judge was wrong in law to find that Mrs  Manzoor's  bank  statement
    complied with the Rules.  It was not impossible for  Barclays  to  find
    out what was in the mind of one of their clients.   They  could  simply
    ask Mrs Manzoor what was her intention with the  money  and  she  could
    have instructed them that her intention was to make  the  �40,000  plus
    available to the Appellant and his team member.

36.  If the Appellant could not show that  he  had  the  �40,000  available,
    whether he could show the remaining  �10,000  or  not  was  beside  the
    point.  In fact he could not show that  either  since  the  information
    that he relied on from his accountants itself postdated the application
    and was therefore not admissible.  Similarly the Respondent  was  under
    no obligation to request further documentation in relation to that sum.
     Even if Zash had �10,000 in its bank account it still had to show  how
    that money had got there  whether  by  way  of  a  director's  loan  or
    otherwise and that information had to be supplied at the time of making
    the application not after the decision.

37.  The Appellant relied on the fact  that  his  team  member  was  granted
    leave to remain but he was not.  It was argued that the team member was
    granted on the basis of the same facts as the Appellant.  However it is
    well settled that a Respondent's decision is not  to  be  taken  as  an
    acceptance of any particular fact contained  in  an  application.   For
    example if an applicant is granted asylum at an  earlier  date  by  the
    Respondent without a Tribunal hearing it is not to be  taken  that  any
    particular finding as to the credibility  of  the  applicant  has  been
    made.  Where Mr Irfan was granted but the Appellant was  not,  it  does
    not follow that the  Respondent  has  considered  the  same  facts  and
    matters in arriving at the two different  decisions.   There  might  be
    many reasons why Mr  Irfan  was  granted  and  the  Appellant  was  not
    relating to Mr Irfan's personal circumstances which it is not  open  to
    the Tribunal to speculate about.

38.  I do not  consider  that  just  because  two  separate  decisions  were
    arrived at in this  case  the  decision  to  refuse  the  Appellant  is
    perverse.  It may be for example that the  decision  in  favour  of  Mr
    Irfan was a generous one (granting an application  outside  the  Rules)
    but that would not mean that the Respondent was bound to  exercise  the
    same generosity in relation to the Appellant.  The  Appellant  did  not
    have any form of legitimate expectation that his application  would  be
    granted by the Respondent once Mr Irfan's was.  Both team  members  had
    to be able to show that they could both comply with the requirements of
    the Rules.  Otherwise one could have the situation where simply because
    somebody is a team member they must be granted even if they clearly  do
    not meet the Rules, where the first team member has been granted.  Each
    case must be decided on its own facts and on the  particular  facts  of
    this case the Appellant could not meet the Immigration Rules.

39.  No arguments were made to me regarding Article 8.  This must  be  right
    since the Appellant had only been in the United  Kingdom  a  relatively
    short time, he had no established family life and his  status  in  this
    country was precarious as a student and post-study migrant with limited
    leave.  Even if Article 8 was engaged in this case it would clearly  be
    proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued to remove the Appellant.  I
    therefore dismiss the Appellant's appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside.

I remake the decision in this case  by  dismissing  the  Appellant's  appeal
against the Respondent's decision to refuse leave.

Appellant's appeal dismissed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have set the decision of the First-tier aside as  it  made  a  material
error of law, I have set aside the fee award  made  at  the  first  instance
such that no fee is payable by the Respondent in this case.
