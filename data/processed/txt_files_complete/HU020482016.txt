Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Dhanji, Counsel instructed by Malik & Malik,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant appeals the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated
    on 10th April 2017  dismissing  her  appeal  against  the  respondent's
    refusal dated 12th January 2016  of  her  human  rights  claim  on  the
    grounds of Article 8 (family and  private  life),  having  refused  her
    further leave to remain in the United Kingdom as the spouse of a person
    present and settled here.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nepal born on  8th  April  1980  and  she
    entered the United Kingdom on 27th April 2013 with entry clearance as a
    spouse valid from 26th  March  2013  until  26th  December  2015.   Her
    application was considered under Appendix FM and paragraphs  276ADE  of
    the Immigration Rules.  The refusal of January 2017 reasoned  that  the
    appellant failed to meet Appendix FM-SE because she had not supplied an
    employer's letter or sufficient amount of wage slips  or  corresponding
    bank statements.

 3. The Secretary of State was not satisfied that there were insurmountable
    obstacles in accordance with paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM, such  that
    there would be very significant difficulties which would  be  faced  by
    the appellant or her spouse in continuing family life outside the UK in
    Nepal.  There was no evidence that  relocating  to  Nepal  would  cause
    serious hardship.  The appellant had no dependent children and  it  was
    found there were no exceptional circumstances.

 4. On the dismissal of the appeal by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Bowler  an
    application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was made  on
    the following grounds

           i)  it was submitted that there was a finding that the appellant
              and her husband were in a  genuine,  subsisting  relationship
              and thus family life was engaged, and the  question  for  the
              court was whether or not it was rationally justifiable as  to
              whether the decision was proportionate in the  light  of  all
              the circumstances.  The appellant could not  be  expected  to
              enjoy her Article 8 rights elsewhere and the judge failed  to
              take into account all the relevant  circumstances,  including
              compelling and compassionate circumstances.   To  expect  the
              appellant  and  his  wife  to  return  to  Nepal   would   be
              unjustifiably harsh.  Beoku-Betts was cited,  such  that  the
              Article 8 rights of the family should be taken  into  account
              and the judge had failed to address  the  core  values  which
              Article 8 protected.

          ii) the reasoning of the First-tier Tribunal Judge was inadequate
              and insufficient in  all  the  circumstances  and  the  judge
              committed an error of law  in  finding  that  there  were  no
              compassionate or compelling circumstances.

         iii) the findings made by the judge were not open to him  and  the
              findings should be set aside.

 5. Permission to appeal was initially refused by Designated Tribunal Judge
    McClure.  He found that in making the  application  the  appellant  and
    sponsor had failed to submit relevant documentation under Appendix  FM-
    SE and although further documentation had  been  submitted,  the  judge
    indicated there was  still  a  lack  of  evidence  in  respect  of  the
    employer's letter and the lack of payslips.  The appellant did not meet
    the requirements of the Rules.  In  that  light  the  judge  considered
    Article 8 and was satisfied there were no insurmountable obstacles  and
    was fully justified in coming to his conclusions.

 6. Upper Tribunal Judge Canavan found that the grounds of appeal were  not
    particularised but that arguably the judge's  finding  at  27  required
    further consideration as to whether the decision struck a fair  balance
    and finding that the evidence that showed the appellant and her husband
    had a combined income of over �18,600 at the date of the hearing and it
    was at least arguable that the public policy consideration underpinning
    the Immigration Rules had been addressed and  that  the  weight  to  be
    placed in the  public  interest  was  thereby  diminished  (see  99  MM
    (Lebanon) v The Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017]  UKSC
    10).  It was argued that the Tribunal erred in failing to consider  how
    the balancing exercise should be assessed in the light of  recent  case
    law.

The Hearing

 7. At the hearing Mr Dhanji submitted that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    had erred in the identification of  the  public  interest  and  in  the
    balancing  exercise.   It  was  clear,  and  Mr  Dhanji  accepted  from
    paragraph 27 that the appellant could not meet  the  Immigration  Rules
    with respect to Appendix FM-SE because not all the documents  had  been
    submitted, but the judge also identified  that  the  Immigration  Rules
    were only the starting point.  It was held in MM (Lebanon)  that  where
    the Tribunal was satisfied that an  appellant's  level  of  income  was
    above �18,600 that was a relevant  factor  and  should  be  taken  into
    account.  I was referred to paragraphs 93 to 99 of MM (Lebanon).

 8. The judge had addressed MM (Lebanon) but had considered it in  relation
    to alternative financing, but that was not the only application  of  MM
    (Lebanon).  Albeit that the appellants did not  meet  the  requirements
    with respect to the specified evidence they did also satisfy a  minimum
    income requirement.

 9. Mr Tufan raised the case of SS (Congo) v  SSHD  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  317,
    which although had been overturned on  its  facts,  the  law,  on  this
    point, was not overturned.  I was referred to paragraphs 82 and  89  in
    relation  to  the  proportionality   exercise.    The   Supreme   Court
    promulgated MM (Lebanon) at the same time  as  Agyarko  &  Ors  v  SSHD
    [2017] UKSC 11 which concluded the relevant test  when  Article  8  was
    refused,  was  whether  the  refusal  or  removal   would   result   in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences.  It was open to the appellant to make
    a further application if she wished to do so within 28 days.

10. Mr Dhanji at this point submitted that in fact any new application  had
    to be made within fourteen  days  and  otherwise  there  needed  to  be
    exceptional circumstances.  Mr Dhanji also accepted that  MM  (Lebanon)
    had not overturned SS (Congo) on the points discussed, but paragraph 99
    of MM (Lebanon) was authority for the  proposition  that  although  the
    Rules may be restrictive it is open to the judge to take  into  account
    his finding in the balancing  exercise  and  the  judge  had  erred  by
    distinguishing MM (Lebanon).

Conclusions

11. The grounds are interwoven but the judge clearly addressed the  essence
    of Article 8.  He was aware of the background and context of the appeal
    and that there was a genuine and subsisting  relationship  between  the
    appellant and her husband. It was open to  the  judge  to  address  the
    Immigration Rules as a basis for his subsequent findings on  Article  8
    and for which he addressed the relevant factors.  As the judge noted at
    paragraph 12  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules  sets  out  the
    eligibility requirements to remain as a spouse, and one of the bases to
    stay requires that the  applicant  provides  specified  evidence  of  a
    specified gross annual income of at least �18,600.  Appendix FM-SE sets
    out the specified evidence that applicants need to provide to meet  the
    requirements of the Rules, and paragraph A1 of Appendix FM-SE  confirms
    that to meet the financial requirement  the  applicant  must  meet  the
    level of financial requirement and the requirements specified as to the
    evidence required for each permitted source relied upon.

12. The judge considered  whether  the  appellant  had  complied  with  the
    financial requirements of the Immigration  Rules  and  identified  that
    with regards the appellant she had three jobs and that  the  employer's
    letter for her first job was deficient and that no  employers'  letters
    had been provided for her two further part-time jobs.  Further, for the
    second employment she had not provided  the  requisite  six  months  of
    payslips.  In relation to the third employment there were  no  payslips
    for the said employer, but payslips for another employer.  Further, the
    appellant had provided bank statements for a year  before  the  hearing
    but not for the six months before the application.

13. For the appellant's husband's income, the  employer's  letter  did  not
    state for  how  long  his  earnings  had  been  paid  or  the  type  of
    employment.  Once again, the appellant's husband's employment  did  not
    meet the required six month period for either  the  period  before  the
    application or the period prior to the hearing.   The  bank  statements
    for the appellant's husband showed varying payments from his  employer.
    It was the P60s alone for the tax year to 5th April 2016 that indicated
    the appellant's husband and the appellant earned in excess of  �18,600,
    and at paragraph 27 the judge found ultimately:-

         "27.     Considering the evidence in the employer's letters and the
             P60's (sic) I find that the Appellant and her  husband  had  a
             combined income in the year ending 5 April 2016 in  excess  of
             �18,600 and also have an ongoing income in excess of �18,600.

         28.       However,  the  Appellant  has  failed  to   satisfy   the
             requirements of Appendix FM-SE.  First, the requirements apply
             to the period  prior  to  the  date  of  application  and  the
             additional evidence provided for the  hearing  did  not  cover
             that period.

         29.      Even if I was to consider the period prior to the date  of
             the hearing there is insufficient evidence regarding  her  and
             her husband's employment.  The �18,600 amount could  be  shown
             by providing the specified evidence  regarding  her  husband's
             employment and one of her part time  jobs.   The  evidence  in
             relation to her Excel Cleaning  job  is  substantially  there,
             although the employer's letter is  missing  one  confirmation.
             However, there are insufficient  payslips  for  her  husband's
             employment and  his  employer's  letter  omits  one  piece  of
             information.

         30.      The Appellant has had ample time to  provide  the  correct
             documentation  or  to  provide  explanations  why  it  is  not
             available as the refusal letter made  clear  what  information
             was missing.  The Appellant did  explain  why  she  could  not
             provide employer letters for two of her jobs, but there is  no
             reason for the lack of payslips for her husband's work, or for
             the  failure  of  the  employment  letters  provided  for  the
             Appellant  and  her  husband  to  set  out  all  the  required
             information.  These are maters (sic)  about  which  her  legal
             representatives should have been in a position to advise her."

14. Mr Dhanji was essentially reliant on the finding at [27] by  the  judge
    that the financial requirements had been met but that is not the  whole
    of the judge's reasoning which needs to  be  read  in  context  of  the
    decision as a whole.

15. Whilst the judge finds initially that on the face of the  evidence  the
    income for the year ending 5th April 2016 showed a combined  income  in
    excess of �18,600, he also found this was not adequately evidenced even
    at the date of the hearing (as can be seen from the reference above  at
    paragraph 29).  At [30] the judge clearly has found that the  appellant
    has had ample time to provide the correct documentation and  there  was
    no reason for the lack of payslips for her husband's work  or  for  the
    failure of the employer's letter for the appellant and her  husband  to
    set out all the required information.  It was  open  to  the  judge  to
    accord what weight he did on the underpinning evidence.

16. In my view the judge had found that there had been, on the face of  it,
    an income in excess of �18,600, but had not found  that  the  appellant
    had indeed evidenced that income over the relevant period, either prior
    to the application or  prior  to  the  hearing.  As  such  it  was  not
    reliable.   MM (Lebanon) confirms that:-

         "The issue is always whether the authorities  have  struck  a  fair
         balance between the individual and public interests and the factors
         identified by the Strasbourg court have to be taken  into  account,
         among them the 'significant weight' which has to be  given  to  the
         interests of children."

17. The Supreme Court in MM (Lebanon) upheld the Immigration Rules  finding
    that the Rules were not couched in a form which made non-compliance  in
    individual cases practically inevitable, and in essence found  that  at
    paragraph 58:-

         "58.     Consistently with that approach,  when  dealing  with  the
             appeal  in   SS   (Congo)   (para   256),   she   accepts   as
             'uncontroversial'  the   appellant's   submission   that   the
             requirements of rules 'do  not  absolve  decision-makers  from
             carrying out a full  merits  based  fact-sensitive  assessment
             outside the rules'.

         ...

         65.       Secondly,  it  was  wrong  to  interpret  the  House   as
             indicating that individual decisions should be  made  entirely
             on a case-by-case basis, without regard to  the  Secretary  of
             State's  policy,  or  to  the  need  for  predictability   and
             consistency. Paragraph 16 of the opinion is quite clear as  to
             the importance of such factors:

             'There  will,  in  almost  any   case,   be   certain   general
                  considerations to bear in mind: the general administrative
                  desirability of  applying  known  rules  if  a  system  of
                  immigration  control  is  to  be  workable,   predictable,
                  consistent and fair as between one applicant and  another;
                  the damage to good administration and effective control if
                  a system is perceived by applicants internationally to  be
                  unduly porous, unpredictable or perfunctory ...'

             As was said, the giving of weight to such factors is  part  of
             the ordinary  judicial  task  of  weighing  up  the  competing
             considerations  and  'according  appropriate  weight  to   the
             judgment of a person with responsibility for a  given  subject
             matter  and  access  to  special  sources  of  knowledge   and
             advice'."

18. As emphasised in MM (Lebanon), and recognised in Huang  v  SSHD  [2007]
    UKHL 11, "fairness and consistency are important considerations at both
    levels"  but  recognised  that  the  courts  may  look  at  the   wider
    circumstances:-

         "The Secretary of  State  can  give  guidance  to  entry  clearance
         officers and expect it to be followed, but has  no  such  power  to
         influence the decisions  of  tribunal  judges  in  respect  of  the
         Convention. Frustrating though it  may  be  for  the  Secretary  of
         State,  under  the  present  legislation  the  task  of   promoting
         consistency at that  level  falls  to  the  tribunals  themselves."
         (Paragraph 71)

19. Nonetheless, the judgment continues at paragraph 75:-

         "As Lord Reed has shown  (Hesham  Ali,  paras  46f),  although  the
         tribunal must make its own judgment, it should attach 'considerable
         weight to judgments made by the Secretary of State in the  exercise
         of her constitutional responsibility for immigration policy'."

20. It is clear that not everything in the Rules need be  treated  as  high
    policy, or peculiarly within the province of the  Secretary  of  State,
    and there is a difference between considerations which would  apply  to
    Rules reflecting the Secretary  of  State's  assessment  of  levels  of
    income required to avoid a burden on public resources and Rules and  to
    the quality of evidence necessary to satisfy that test.

21. In this case the judge  had  found  that  the  payslips  had  not  been
    provided, even at the date of hearing.  This was despite his finding in
    relation to the overall income presented in the P60s.

22. MM (Lebanon) found that the Rule may cause hardship but  that  did  not
    mean that it was incompatible with Convention rights, and at  paragraph
    98 the Supreme Court confirmed that with regards to the minimum  income
    requirements

           "In our view, it was not irrational in the common law sense  for
           the Secretary  of  State  to  give  priority  in  the  rules  to
           simplicity of operation and ease of verification".

      At paragraph 99, the Supreme Court  considered  that  the  restrictive
      approach outside the Rules  was  a  different  matter  and  much  more
      difficult to justify under the  Human  Rights  Act.   Specifically  at
      paragraph 99 it stated

           "Certainly, nothing that is said in  the  instructions  to  case
           officers can prevent the tribunal on appeal from looking at  the
           matter more broadly"

    and further

           "There is nothing to prevent the tribunal, in the context of the
           HRA appeal, from judging  for  itself  the  reliability  of  any
           alternative sources of finance in  the  light  of  the  evidence
           before it".

23. It is not, however, the case in this instance that the judge failed  to
    consider the evidence  as  at  the  date  of  hearing,  and  indeed  an
    important aspect of the factors to be taken into account in the Article
    8 consideration, that is proof of the income, was  not  present  before
    the judge and that is  made  clear  by  paragraph  30  of  the  judge's
    decision which I have quoted above.

24. The judge at  paragraph  51  makes  clear  that  it  was  open  to  the
    respondent to indicate criteria by which reliability  of  such  sources
    may be judged, and as he states, by  allowing  the  appellant's  appeal
    outside the Rules it would, in effect, be simply applying a  near  miss
    approach.  The judge's reasoning at paragraphs 51  and  52  make  clear
    that

      'there was nothing to prevent the tribunal,  in  the  context  of  the
    human rights appeal, from judging for itself  the  reliability  of  any
    alternative sources of finance in the light of the evidence before  it.
    However the case makes clear that it was  open  to  the  Respondent  to
    indicate criteria by which reliability of such sources may be  judged'.



    It would appear that the judge is, in effect, adopting the criteria  of
    the Secretary of State as to assessing reliability.  That approach  was
    open to the judge.

25. An overall reading of the decision demonstrates that the judge directed
    himself appropriately.  He considered  the  obstacles  both  appellants
    would face on return (belying the suggestion that the husband's  rights
    were not considered) and found that it  would  be  reasonable  for  the
    family to conduct their family life in Nepal if they chose not to  make
    another application to stay in the United  Kingdom.   If  anything  the
    judge applied too lenient a  test  but  that  was  to  the  appellant's
    advantage and discloses no  error  of  law.  Reading  Agyarko  into  MM
    (Lebanon) there are no unjustifiably harsh circumstances set out in the
    evidence and recorded by the judge, and as such he was entitled to take
    the decision he did.

26. As set out in SS Congo v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 317 at paragraph 89

           "The FTT also erred in saying that it would not be proportionate
           to  expect  FA  to  make  a  further  application.  Since   FA's
           application failed to comply with the Immigration Rules  and  no
           compelling circumstances were identified why those Rules  should
           not be applied in her case in the usual way, there  was  nothing
           disproportionate in applying the Rules in accordance with  their
           terms, with the effect that  FA's  application  failed  and  she
           would have to make a new one. The Entry Clearance  Officer  (and
           the FTT) was not required to waive the operation of the Rules as
           some sort of goodwill gesture because of the way in  which  FA's
           previous application had been dealt with."

27. SS (Congo) was not overturned by MM (Lebanon)  on  this  point  and  SS
    (Congo) confirmed that an alternative application could be made,  which
    is precisely the reasoning the judge has adopted.  As the judge states,
    finally, in paragraph 53 that it was open to  the  appellant  to  apply
    again providing  all  the  required  evidence.   As  underlined  in  MM
    (Lebanon) it is open  to  the  judge  to  take  into  account  relevant
    factors, when undertaking the proportionality balancing exercising, not
    just those factors under the Immigration Rules.

28. The grounds of permission to appeal cited  Beoku-Betts  v  SSHD  [2008]
    UKHL 39 but the husband's interests were taken into account overall. It
    is relevant, and the judge was  aware  that  there  were  no  children.
    Nothing in the decision suggests that the judge failed to  address  the
    wider issues outside the Rules, having properly used them as a starting
    point, and as he is enjoined to do by the courts. That said it was open
    to the judge to place emphasis on the rules, the  lawfulness  of  which
    has been upheld by the  courts.   Ultimately,  the  judge  applied  the
    correct test at paragraph 54, namely whether the decision taken by  the
    respondent was necessary and proportionate.  The  judge  addressed  the
    relevant issues and gave cogent  and  full  reasoning  having  directed
    himself appropriately on the law.

29. For the reasoning above, I  find  no  error  of  law.   The  judge  was
    entitled to take the approach that he did and the decision shall stand.

30. No anonymity direction is made.
