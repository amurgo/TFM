                                   Notice

 1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan born on 15 January 1988.  In  a
    decision dated 4 September 2014 the respondent refused the  appellant's
    application, made on 9 October 2013, for further leave to remain  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant.   The  respondent  stated  that  the
    appellant had no right of appeal against the decision which was not  an
    immigration decision under section 82(2)(d) of  the  2002  Act  as  the
    appellant had no valid leave in the UK when he made the application  on
    9 October 2013.   The  4  September  2014  letter  indicates  that  the
    appellant had previously been refused on 20 August 2013 with a right of
    appeal but those rights were not exercised.

 2. The issue of whether the appellant had a right of appeal was considered
    on 10 November 2014 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Fisher  who  indicated
    that the matter was arguable and could be  decided  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge. The hearing on  18  May  2015  was  adjourned,  without
    considering the validity of the appeal,  to  allow  the  respondent  to
    produce further evidence. First-tier Tribunal Judge Kimnell sitting  on
    24 June 2015 found that the appellant did not have a  valid  in-country
    appeal.

 3. The appellant applied for leave to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, on the
    grounds that the Judge was wrong to conclude that the judge had no  in-
    country right of appeal and secondly that  the  Judge  failed  to  give
    adequate reasons for his decision.  In  a  decision  dated  20  October
    2015, the First-tier Tribunal Judge considering permission stated  that
    he was not satisfied that there  was  'any  arguable  merit  in  either
    complaint' and set out why this was the case, including the history  of
    the appellant's  leave  which  was  valid  until  28  June  2013.   The
    appellant made an in-time application to vary that  leave  on  28  June
    2013.  This application was refused on 20 August 2013 and a section  47
    removal decision was made.  Although those  immigration  decisions  did
    carry a right of appeal the appellant did not exercise  that  right  of
    appeal and therefore s3C could not operate to extend  his  leave.   The
    appellant made a further  application  on  9  October  2013  which  was
    refused on 4 September 2014 due to the lack of a valid CAS and  alleged
    reliance upon a fraudulently obtained ETS certificate.

 4. However, despite clearly intending to refuse permission  to  appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal for the reasons  summarised  above,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision was headed:  'Permission  to  appeal  is  granted'.
    Although Mr Adophy argued valiantly that there  was  no  error  in  the
    permission decision dated 20 October 2015, he conceded, as  an  officer
    of the court, that the decision pointed to a refusal.

 5. I considered the grounds of appeal.   Mr  Adophy  argued  that  the  20
    August 2013 decision had not been served on the appellant or 'at  all'.
    I had a copy of this letter and note it was addressed to the  appellant
    at an address in Ilford, Essex, which is  the  same  address  that  the
    Tribunal hold for the appellant.  Mr Adophy suggested that the decision
    letter had not been served on the correct address and he relied on  his
    skeleton argument which argued that another letter, from Opal  College,
    had  also  been  'wrongly  addressed'  and  was  not  received  by  the
    Appellant.

 6. I do not find any merit in these arguments, not least  because  despite
    claiming that the wrong address was on the respondent's decision letter
    of 21 August 2013, Mr  Adophy  had  to  concede  that  the  appellant's
    grounds of appeal to the Tribunal dated 22 September 2014 contained the
    same address.  It is difficult to see how the respondent could be  said
    to have had the wrong address for the appellant in August 2013 when the
    appellant was still using this address in September 2014  (and  no  new
    address has been received by the  Tribunal).   The  appellant's  bundle
    also included a letter from the appellant to the respondent,  dated  19
    August 2013 which gives the same address for the  appellant.   Although
    Mr Adophy pointed to the 21 August 2013 refusal letter not being in the
    Home Office 'bundle' the information produced by the respondent related
    to the out of time application against which there is no valid  appeal,
    rather than the earlier decision.  The bundle was also not in the usual
    'appeal bundle' form, and it is stated on the cover sheet that  as  the
    appellant was 'served with IS151A therefore caseworker hasn't  prepared
    any PF1  and  annexes  for  this  case'  presumably  as  this  was  not
    considered to be a valid appeal.

 7. The appellant relied on the further letter dated 23 September 2013 from
    the  respondent  to  the  appellant  in  response  to  the  appellant's
    indication in a letter dated  19  August  2013  that  his  sponsor  had
    withdrawn his CAS.  This letter stated that:

         '... there is as nothing we can do about this.  You  will  need  to
         obtain a new CAS and submit a new application if you wish to remain
         in the United Kingdom'.

    However, this is  not  a  case,  as  Mr  Adophy  suggested,  where  the
    appellant was allowed 60 days to obtain a new CAS and was being advised
    of that right.  The appellant's application had already  been  refused.
    The appellant did subsequently submit a new application  which  led  to
    the refusal with no right of appeal.

 8. There is no merit in the argument that the appellant  did  not  receive
    the 21 August 2013 refusal letter and I note that the  'wrong  address'
    argument has now been made about two separate letters:  from  the  Home
    Office (in 2013) and  Opal  College  (it  is  stated  in  the  skeleton
    argument that this was July 2014, although it may well be that this was
    intended to say July 2013).  Given that the Home Office sent the letter
    to the appellant's longstanding  address  in  Ilford  (and  it  is  not
    suggested that the appellant did not  receive  the  23  September  2013
    letter from the  respondent  again  sent  to  the  same  address)  this
    argument cannot succeed.

 9. Although Judge Kimnell may not have specifically addressed the issue of
    the 21 August 2013 decision (and it  does  not  appear  that  such  was
    raised before him by the appellant) any error is not material as  Judge
    Kimnell correctly identified that the appellant had  lodged  a  further
    application, on 9 October 2013, after his leave expired.

Decision

10. I affirm the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge that there is no
    valid right of appeal.
