               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Spurling, Counsel instructed by Barnes Harrild &
Dyer
For the Respondent:    Mr Clerk, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. By my decision promulgated on 6 September  2019  I  set  aside  the
         decision of the First-tier Tribunal. I now remake that decision.

      2. At the outset of the hearing, Mr Clerk conceded that in light of HB
         (Kurds) Iran CG [2018]  UKUT  00430  (IAC)  the  appeal  should  be
         allowed as there is  a  real  risk  that  the  appellant  would  be
         questioned, and asked for access to his Facebook account, on return
         to Iran.

      3. In light of the respondent's concession, I remake the  decision  of
         the First-Tier Tribunal by allowing the appellant's appeal  against
         the refusal of his protection claim on the basis that  his  removal
         from the UK would breach the U.K.'s obligations under  the  Refugee
         Convention.

|                                  |                                  |
|                                  |                                  |
