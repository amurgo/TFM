Anonymity - Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge A A Wilson (the judge), promulgated on 10 November 2016,
    by which he dismissed the Appellant's appeal.   That  appeal  had  been
    against the Respondent's decision of 27 April 2015, refusing his  human
    rights claim.  That decision arose from an application made in February
    2015 relying on a relationship with a Latvian national (the application
    was on human rights grounds rather than under the EEA  Regulations  for
    some reason).

The judge's decision

 2. Over the course of time since the Respondent's decision the Appellant's
    circumstances had changed.  He had entered into a relationship  with  a
    British national and they had had a child together.

 3. The Appellant's appeal first came before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in
    June 2016 where amended grounds of appeal were submitted and the issues
    of new relationship and the child were canvassed.  At that hearing  the
    Presenting Officer disputed the genuineness of the relationship and the
    paternity of the child.  In light of this  an  adjournment  application
    was made and then granted.  The judge concluded that it  was  important
    for the Appellant to be able to obtain  DNA  evidence  in  relation  to
    paternity.  At that stage  no  clear  directions  as  to  the  possible
    application of section 85(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
    Act 2002, as amended, were made.

 4. The matter then came before the judge on 25 October 2016.  DNA evidence
    was produced.  The judge considered the application of section 85(5) as
    a preliminary matter.  He set out the relevant provision  and  then  in
    paragraph 6 concluded that the First-tier  Tribunal  had  no  power  to
    direct the Respondent to consider any "new matter".  In light  of  this
    (and  on  the  assumption  that  the  judge  was  regarding   the   new
    relationship as a "new matter")  he  decided  it  would  be  futile  to
    adjourn  the  hearing.   He  therefore  concluded  that   he   had   no
    jurisdiction to consider the issue of  the  new  relationship  and  the
    British child.

 5. Between paragraphs 8 and 11 the  judge  goes  on  to  make  alternative
    findings  and  conclusions  on  the  Article  8  claim,  including  the
    relationship and the child.  On the basis of the law and  findings  set
    out in these paragraphs,  the  judge  concluded  that  if  he  had  had
    jurisdiction he would have found that it was  not  reasonable  for  the
    child to leave the United Kingdom and therefore the appeal  would  have
    been allowed, with particular reference to section 117B(6) of the  2002
    Act.

Grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 6. The grounds assert (albeit not entirely clearly) that the Appellant had
    varied his grounds of appeal and that the Respondent had taken no issue
    on these.  In other words, by implication it is said that the issue  of
    section 85(5) was never raised.  The grounds go  on  to  say  that  the
    judge did not raise this issue either,  and  that  he  had  acted  with
    procedural unfairness  in  taking  the  point  himself  and  concluding
    against the Appellant.

 7. Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge P J M  Hollingworth
    on 8 May 2017.




The hearing before me

 8. At the outset of the hearing I enquired of both representatives  as  to
    whether section 85(5) had ever in fact been raised by the Respondent at
    any time: having looked at the Record of Proceedings  for  both  First-
    tier Tribunal hearings I could see no  indication  that  this  was  the
    case.  Mr Tarlow indicated that there was  nothing  in  the  Presenting
    Officer's minutes to suggest that the issue of a new  matter  had  been
    raised.  For his part, Mr Kannangara informed me that  no  such  matter
    had been raised (he had in fact appeared at both hearings).

 9.  Mr  Kannangara  submitted  that  the  change  in  the  nature  of  the
    Appellant's case on appeal was not a "new matter" for the  purposes  of
    section 85(5).  It was simply an element  of  his  original  Article  8
    claim.

10. Alternatively, he submitted that if it had been  a  "new  matter",  the
    Respondent, by her actions/inactions, had given implicit consent to the
    Tribunal considering the matter.  In light of this the judge was  wrong
    to have taken the point against the Appellant, particularly when he had
    not raised the matter with the representatives at  the  hearing  before
    him.  Mr Kannangara suggested that  I  should  set  aside  the  judge's
    decision and remake the decision for myself, adopting  in  effect  what
    the judge had said in paragraphs 8 to 11 of his decision.

11. Mr Tarlow acknowledged that he could see no reference to the  issue  of
    section 85(5) ever having been raised or relied upon by the Respondent.
     He agreed that I could, if I were to find there was an error  of  law,
    remake the decision on the evidence before me.   He  candidly  accepted
    that in light of the unchallenged evidence, the  Appellant  would  very
    probably succeed with regards to the British child and  the  effect  of
    section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act.

Decision on error of law

12. I find that the judge has made material errors of  law.   I  base  this
    conclusion on the following matters.

13. In my view the change in emphasis of the  Appellant's  case  after  the
    Respondent's initial decision did not constitute a "new matter" for the
    purposes of section 85(5), with reference to section 85(6).

14. The relevant provisions of section 85 read as follows:

         "(5) But the Tribunal must not consider a  new  matter  unless  the
             Secretary of State has given the Tribunal consent to do so.

         (6)  A matter is a 'new matter' if -

             (a)  it constitutes a ground of appeal of  a  kind  listed  in
                  Section 84, and

             (b)  the Secretary of State has not previously considered  the
                  matter in the context of -

                  (i)  the decision mentioned in section 82(1), or

                  (ii) a statement made by the Appellant under section 120."

15.  My  reasons  for  concluding  that  the  judge  was   wrong   in   his
    interpretation of the law are as follows.

16. First, the effect of section 85(5) is to limit the jurisdiction of  the
    Tribunal.  Therefore, in my view, it  is  necessary  to  interpret  the
    meaning of the phrase, "a new matter" with caution and narrowly.

17. Second, the "matter" which constitutes the second element of the  term,
    "new matter" clearly means that it is one  of  the  grounds  of  appeal
    under section 84. In the  present  appeal,  the  ground  of  appeal  in
    question is that contained in section 84(2): that the  refusal  of  the
    human rights claim is unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights  Act
    1998. The ground of appeal does not specify "an Article 8 claim".

18. In this case the Appellant's original application was made on the basis
    of Article 8.  The specific  facet  of  the  Article  8  claim  related
    initially to family life with a previous partner.   As  time  moved  on
    there was a change of circumstances and the Appellant sought  to  bring
    into his Article 8 claim his relationship with  the  new  partner.  The
    limited change  in  emphasis  has  not  taken  the  claim  outwith  the
    boundaries of  "a  human  rights  claim",  nor  has  it  changed  in  a
    substantive way the basis upon which the Appellant resists  removal:  a
    removal in consequence of the refusal of the claim  is  unlawful  under
    section 6 of the 1998 Act.

19. Third, in this regard I note the wording of Article 8(1) itself:

         "Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life,
         his home and his correspondence."

20. In my view, Article  8(1)  encompasses  what  may  be  described  as  a
    'composite right',  comprising  two  elements  of  the  same  protected
    fundamental right. They are, in effect, part and  parcel  of  the  same
    protected right.  I note that the Court of Appeal has stated that there
    is no substantive difference between the assessment of the  two  facets
    of this right where removal is proposed (see, for example, Singh [2015]
    EWCA  Civ  630,  at  paragraph  25).   Relationships  are  part  of  an
    individual's private life, just as they are part  of  family  life  (as
    confirmed in Strasbourg on numerous occasions: see, for example,  Petty
    v UK [2002] 35 EHRR 1 and Niemietz v Germany  App  No.  13710/88).   In
    other words, any distinction to be drawn  is  one  without  a  material
    difference.

21. Fourth, if any distinction is to be made within the ambit  of  a  human
    rights claim (and the right of appeal attached to the refusal thereof),
    it would lie as between an Article 8 case  on  the  one  hand,  and  an
    Article 3 protection case on the other. There is an easy line  to  draw
    here.

22. Fifth, I have borne in mind the Respondent's guidance on the changes to
    appeal rights brought about by the Immigration  Act  2014  (a  document
    dated 8 May 2017),  but  it  is  just  that:  guidance.  It  is  of  no
    assistance in interpreting the correct meaning of the section 85(5) and
    (6).  I have not been provided with any other materials to aid with the
    issue of construction.  I have been able to  look  at  the  explanatory
    memorandum which accompanied the introduction of the amendments through
    the Immigration Act 2014, but could find nothing of any value therein.

23. Sixth, even on a generous interpretation of  what  constitutes  a  "new
    matter", the change in the Appellant's case was  one  of  evidence  and
    fact only. He was not even 'switching'  from  private  life  to  family
    life.

24. Seventh, even if  I  were  wrong  about  that  interpretation  of  what
    constitutes a "new matter", in  light  of  the  evidence  before  me  I
    conclude that the Respondent either did not regard the matter as  being
    a "new matter", or implicitly gave consent to the Tribunal  considering
    the issue on appeal.  There is absolutely no indication  whatsoever  in
    either of the Records of Proceedings or  in  the  Presenting  Officer's
    minutes, or anything from the Appellant's side, to show that the  point
    was ever taken by the Respondent.  Indeed, the evidence  firmly  points
    towards the Respondent's willingness to deal with the merits of the new
    relationship.

25. It is clear from what occurred at the first hearing in June  2016  that
    the Presenting Officer had taken issue  with  the  genuineness  of  the
    relationship and paternity, but was  not  stating  that  section  85(5)
    applied and therefore the issue was irrelevant for the purposes of  the
    appeal.  Further, I note that in respect  of  the  hearing  before  the
    judge, there was cross-examination of the Appellant  and  his  partner.
    Plainly, the Respondent was addressing and testing the  merits  of  the
    new relationship.  If the Respondent had taken the view that this was a
    "new  matter:  and/or  that  consent  was  being  withheld,   no   such
    questioning or submissions would have been put forward.  Therefore, the
    judge erred in taking the jurisdictional point at all.

26. Eighth, if the judge was to take the jurisdictional point  of  his  own
    volition it was incumbent upon  him  to  raise  the  matter  with  both
    parties at the outset of the hearing (particularly in view of the  lack
    of clarity on the  issue  following  the  previous  hearing).   On  the
    evidence before me this did not occur.  There was  at  the  very  least
    procedural unfairness on the part of the judge.

27. Ninth, the errors were clearly material given the  judge's  alternative
    findings in paragraphs 8 to 11 of his decision.

28. In light of the above I set aside the judge's decision.

Remaking the decision

29. Both representatives were agreed that  I  should  remake  the  decision
    myself and that I now do.

30. There has been no challenge or dispute as to the judge's  findings  and
    conclusions set out in paragraphs 8 to 11.  Although they were  put  in
    the alternative, and in light of what the judge concluded was a lack of
    jurisdiction, they nonetheless represent a clear assessment of relevant
    factors.  All of the points he has made are backed up by  the  evidence
    before me, and Mr Tarlow has taken no issue with any  of  the  evidence
    whatsoever.

31. In light of the above, I make the following findings.

32. The Appellant has been and is in a genuine and subsisting  relationship
    with his current partner, a British national.  I find that  she  has  a
    chronic physical disability and a history of depression.  I  find  that
    she also has two  children  from  a  previous  relationship.   The  two
    children live with her, aged fifteen and eleven. Both are  British.   I
    find that the older child  has  regular  contact  with  his  biological
    father. I find that the Appellant is the father of the couple's British
    citizen child, and he has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with
    that child.

33. There has been no suggestion that the Appellant can succeed in  respect
    of the Article 8-related Rules.  The new partner is not a "partner" for
    the purposes of GEN.1.2 of Appendix  FM.  The  Parent  Route  does  not
    assist because the family unit live together.

34. I consider the claim outside the scope of the Rules.  I move  first  to
    section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act and have regard to the decision of  the
    Court of Appeal in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705 and AM  (Pakistan)
    [2017] EWCA Civ 180.

35. The best interests of the couple's child as a British  citizen  lie  in
    being with both of his parents and in remaining in the country  of  his
    nationality.

36. In respect of the partner's  two  other  children  I  note  that  their
    respective ages, being eleven and fifteen.  One is about to  move  into
    secondary education, the other will be in the midst of GCSEs. The older
    child at least has contact with their biological father, and it must be
    in their best interests for this to continue. All  of  this,  plus  the
    fact of their own nationality, make it wholly unreasonable for them  to
    leave the United Kingdom.

37. I have regard to all other aspects of the public  interest  factor  set
    out in  section  117B  including  the  overriding  public  interest  in
    ensuring effective immigration control, what appears to be  a  lack  of
    financial independence on the Appellant's part, the  precariousness  of
    his status during the currency of the relationship and  the  fact  that
    best interests are never a trump card.  The English language  point  is
    neutral. I also have regard to section 55 of the  Borders,  Citizenship
    and Immigration Act 2009, together with  the  Respondent's  own  policy
    guidance on Appendix FM  at  paragraph  11.2.3.   The  policy  guidance
    clearly supports the Appellant's case.

38. As it would be unreasonable for the partner's other children  to  leave
    the United Kingdom,  she  could  not  leave  either.  This  is  a  very
    significant factor in the Appellant's favour.

39. I fully agree with the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  that,  taking  all
    relevant matters in  the  round,  it  would  be  unreasonable  for  the
    couple's child to leave the United Kingdom.

40. In light of the above, I conclude that the Appellant is  able  to  meet
    the criteria set out in section 117B(6) and that therefore he  succeeds
    in his appeal.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal's decision contained material errors of law.

I set aside that decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

I re-make the decision by allowing the Appellant's appeal.  The  refusal  of
the Appellant's human rights claim is unlawful under section 6 of the  Human
Rights Act 1998.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of �140.00. Although  the  Appellant's  case  did  change  over  time,
relevant evidence had been submitted before the First-tier Tribunal and  the
Respondent has been aware of the essential facts for a  considerable  period
of time now, and has maintained her original position, despite  the  obvious
merit in the appeal (as indicated by the Senior  Presenting  Officer  before
me).
