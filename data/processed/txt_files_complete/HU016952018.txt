                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant has been  granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal from the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Bowler
    sitting at Hatton Cross on 14  December  2018)  dismissing  her  appeal
    against the decision of an Entry Clearance Officer to refuse her  entry
    clearance for the purposes of settlement as a child under the age of 18
    of a person present and settled here.  The First-tier Tribunal did  not
    make an anonymity direction, and I do not consider that  the  appellant
    requires anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for Granting Permission to Appeal

 2. On 29 March 2019 First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Hollingworth  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal as it was arguable, in the light of what
    was accepted by the Respondent, that the  Judge  had  not  applied  the
    correct criteria under Rule 297.

Relevant Background

 3. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, whose  date  of  birth  is  28
    December 2018.  Just before her 18th birthday, she  applied  for  entry
    clearance to join her mother in the UK. She presented documents to show
    her father had died on 14 December 2009.

 4. On 27 October 2017 an Entry Clearance  Officer  gave  his  reasons  for
    refusing her application by reference to Rule 297.   He  accepted  that
    her mother was her sole surviving parent. But he was not satisfied that
    her  mother  had  had  sole  responsibility  for  her  upbringing;   or
    alternatively that the criteria in Rule 297(i)(f)  were  satisfied.  In
    addition, he was not satisfied that there would be adequate maintenance
    and accommodation for her and her mother  without  recourse  to  public
    funds, having regard to the guidance given in Ahmed (Benefits; Proof of
    Receipt: Evidence) Bangladesh [2013] UKUT 84 (IAC).

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 5. There was no legal representation for  the  appellant  at  the  hearing
    before Judge  Bowler.   The  Judge  received  oral  evidence  from  the
    Sponsor.

 6. In his subsequent decision, Judge Bowler found  that  the  Sponsor  was
    exercising very little responsibility for the appellant; and  that  her
    welfare was not prejudiced by her current living arrangements.

 7. The Judge then turned to consider an Article 8 claim outside the Rules.
    He observed that the Sponsor's wages of  less  than  �1,350  per  month
    gross as shown by the payslips totalled �16,200, which  was  less  than
    the figure of �18,600 per annum  which  was  "generally  applied  as  a
    financial requirement". Alternatively, the appellant had not shown that
    her mother's wages were sufficient to maintain and accommodate her  and
    her mother without recourse to public funds, "especially as the rent is
    stated to be for a one bedroom flat". The Judge  went  on  to  conclude
    that the interference with family and private life consequential on the
    maintenance of the refusal decision was proportionate.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

 8. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Mr Gilbert briefly  developed  the  appellant's  case.  Mr  Tarlow
    conceded that the Judge had materially erred in law in not  considering
    the application of Rule 297(i)(d).  I accepted Mr Tarlow's  concession,
    and held that an error of law was made out.  My reasons for so  finding
    are set out below.

 9. For the purposes of remaking the decision, I sought clarification  from
    Mr Tarlow as to his  position  on  the  maintenance  and  accommodation
    requirements. He said that  he  was  not  challenging  the  documentary
    evidence on this issue that  had  been  contained  in  the  appellant's
    bundle for the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.  He  made  it  clear
    that he  was  content  that  the  decision  should  be  remade  in  the
    appellant's favour.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

10. Rule 297 provides that the requirements to be met by a  person  seeking
    indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom as the child of a  parent,
    parents or a relative  present  and  settled,  or  being  admitted  for
    settlement into the United Kingdom, are that he:

         (i) is seeking leave to  enter  to  accompany  or  join  a  parent,
         parents or a relative in one of the following circumstances:

              ...

             (d) one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom or
             being admitted on the same occasion  for  settlement  and  the
             other parent is dead (my emphasis); or

             (e) one parent is settled  in  the  United  Kingdom  or  being
             admitted on the same occasion for settlement and has had  sole
             responsibility for the child's upbringing; or

             (f) one parent or a relative is present  and  settled  in  the
             United Kingdom or being admitted  on  the  same  occasion  for
             settlement and there are  serious  and  compelling  family  or
             other  considerations  which  make  exclusion  of  the   child
             undesirable and suitable arrangements have been made  for  the
             child's care; and

         (ii) is under the age of 18; and

         (iii) is not leading an independent life, is unmarried and is not a
         civil partner, and is not from an independent family unit; and

         (iv) can, and will,  be  accommodated  adequately  by  the  parent,
         parents or relative the child is seeking to join  without  recourse
         to public funds in  accommodation  which  the  parent,  parents  or
         relative  of  the  child  is  seeking  to  join,  own   or   occupy
         exclusively; and

         (v) can, and will be maintained adequately by the  parent,  parents
         or relative of the child is seeking to join,  without  recourse  to
         public funds; and

         (vi) holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance for entry in this
         capacity; and

         (viii) does not fall for refusal under the general grounds for  the
         refusal.

11. The Judge gave adequate reasons for finding that the appellant did  not
    satisfy the gateway requirement of sole responsibility or  the  gateway
    requirement of there being  serious  and  compelling  family  or  other
    considerations which  made  her  exclusion  undesirable.   However,  he
    failed to address the question of whether the appellant  qualified  for
    entry clearance on the simple basis that  her  father  was  dead.  Even
    though the point had not been  taken  by  the  appellant  -  which  was
    understandable, as she was not legally represented - it was a "Robinson
    obvious" point which needed to be addressed, as it was accepted in  the
    RFRL that the appellant's father was dead and that the Sponsor was  her
    sole surviving parent.

12. The Judge also erred in not giving adequate reasons  for  finding  that
    the appellant did not meet the requirements of Rules 297(iv) and (v).

13. The reasoning which underpinned the  Judge's  negative  findings  under
    Rules 297(iv) and (v) was that the evidence as to the Sponsor's  income
    and the amount of rent she was paying each month only  consisted  of  a
    "simple statement" to this effect. But this was not true. The bundle of
    documents filed for the hearing contained a Tenancy  Agreement  showing
    that the Sponsor was paying �500 per month and the following sources of
    evidence for the Sponsor's earnings and disposable  income:  a  P60,  a
    series of wage slips, money transfer receipts, and an employment letter
    from Sun Foods Ltd.

14. The Judge also appears to have assumed that a one bedroom flat will  be
    inherently unsuitable to accommodate  the  appellant  as  well  as  her
    mother, although this was not a point taken in the RFRL. As pleaded  in
    the permission application, under the Housing Act 1985 there  will  not
    be statutory over-crowding where two adults share a one bedroom flat.

15. For the above reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains
    an error of law such that it must be set aside and remade.

Discussion and Findings on Remaking

16. It is accepted in  the  RFRL  that  the  appellant's  father  is  dead.
    Accordingly, the  appellant  is  able  to  bring  herself  within  Rule
    297(i)(d) as her mother is present and settled in the  United  Kingdom,
    and "the other parent is dead".  It appears to have been  the  view  of
    the Entry Clearance Officer who refused the application that the  death
    of the father was not the reason why the appellant  was  seeking  entry
    clearance just before her 18th birthday, which is  probably  true,  and
    that therefore  his  death  was  irrelevant  to  the  question  of  the
    appellant's ability to bring herself within the scope of Rule 297  (i).
    But this approach was misconceived. The appellant was not  required  to
    justify her motivation.  All that the Rule requires is that one of  the
    set of  circumstances  set  out  in  sub-paragraph  (i)  applies.   The
    appellant was applying in circumstances where one parent was settled in
    the UK, and the other parent was dead.  That was all that the appellant
    needed to prove.

17. The Entry Clearance Officer put  in  issue  the  Sponsor's  ability  to
    maintain and accommodate the appellant adequately without  recourse  to
    public funds, due to the paucity of the supporting  documents  provided
    with  the  application.  As  Mr  Tarlow  accepts,  the  appellant   has
    adequately addressed this concern by filing the documents which I  have
    listed in [13] above. It is common ground that the appellant  does  not
    need to meet the MIR. She has provided sufficient evidence to show that
    her mother's net income comfortably exceeds the rent  she  has  to  pay
    each month, and that, after taking into  account  additional  outgoings
    such as utility bills, there is still likely  to  a  be  a  substantial
    surplus in the mother's disposal income so as to enable her to maintain
    and accommodate her daughter adequately in the UK without  recourse  to
    public funds.

18. As all the relevant requirements of Rule 297 are met, the  question  of
    proportionality does not arise. The appellant has  made  out  her  case
    that the decision to refuse her human rights claim by reference to Rule
    297 is unlawful under Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted:

The appellant's appeal is allowed.

I make no anonymity direction.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed this appeal, I have given consideration as to  whether  to
make a fee award in respect of any fee which has been paid  or  is  payable,
and I have decided to make a whole fee award of �80 as the  main  ground  of
refusal was misconceived.
