                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant claims to be a  national  of  Burma  born  in  1988.   He
    appeals with permission the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge
    Shergill) to dismiss his protection and human rights appeal.


    Anonymity


 2. Having regard to the fact that this is  a  protection  claim,  and  the
    Appellant has been found to be a victim of trafficking, I  am  prepared
    to make the following direction for anonymity, pursuant to Rule  14  of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the Presidential
    Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders.


        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This direction applies both to the Appellant  and  to  the
        Respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction  could  lead  to
        contempt of court proceedings".




    Background and Decision of the First-tier Tribunal


 3. The basis of the Appellant's linked protection and human rights  claims
    is that he faced a well-founded fear of persecution in Burma because of
    his ethnicity/membership of a particular social group: he claims to  be
    a Rohingya Muslim.   He claims that he was brought to Bangladesh by his
    parents when he was approximately three years old.   They  lived  in  a
    refugee camp. When the Appellant was about six years  old  his  parents
    sent him out of the camp in the care  of  another  man.  The  Appellant
    thereafter lived in Bangladesh, outside of the Rohingya camps, until he
    was about 28 years  old.  During  those  years  he  worked  in  various
    capacities, running chores, pulling rickshaws, and latterly as  a  shop
    assistant.   The Appellant further claimed to have  been  a  victim  of
    trafficking: this element of his claim was accepted  by  the  Competent
    Authority in its 'Conclusive Grounds' decision of the 9th July 2016.

 4. The Respondent accepts that the Appellant  would  face  persecution  in
    Burma/Myanmar if he is Rohingya; the  Respondent  would  not  in  those
    circumstances  expect  the  Appellant  to  turn   to   Bangladesh   for
    protection.    The Respondent does not however accept  the  Appellant's
    claimed ethnicity.   As to the trafficking  aspect  of  the  claim  the
    Respondent, by his letter  dated  the  20th  January  2018,  notes  and
    accepts the Conclusive Grounds decision of the Competent Authority  but
    makes no further comment upon it.

 5. When the matter came  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  Appellant
    relied on his own  evidence,  and  a  document  which  he  said  was  a
    registration paper given to  his  family  upon  their  arrival  in  the
    refugee camp in Bangladesh. The Appellant is named  on  that  paper  as
    part of his father's household and this, he states, establishes that he
    is in fact Rohingya.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal rejected the  Appellant's  evidence  about  his
    claimed ethnicity. The determination  is  long  and  detailed  but  the
    reasons given can be summarised as follows:

              i) The Appellant has given  a  detailed  account  of  why  his
                 family fled Burma, and a description of where  they  lived.
                 He states that he has this information because his  parents
                 used to tell him about it when they lived in the camp.  The
                 Tribunal does not accept that a child of six  would  retain
                 such information and be able to recall it,  over  20  years
                 later,  with  such  "crystal  clear"  clarity.  It  is  not
                 plausible that the Appellant would be able to remember this
                 information. It does not fit in with what can be considered
                 as "ordinary human experience";


             ii) It was curious that he was able to give  information  about
                 some matters, yet on other matters he was unable to do so;

            iii) The refugee registration  document  is  not  reliable.  The
                 colour is too vivid for it to have been issued in 1991, and
                 given the evidence that the Appellant has  lived  destitute
                 and in very difficult circumstances for many  years  it  is
                 not plausible that the  document  would  have  remained  in
                 "near  pristine"  condition.  Taking   into   account   the
                 prevalence of forged documents in Bangladesh  the  Tribunal
                 concludes that the  paper  is  of  dubious  provenance  and
                 attaches no weight to it;

             iv) Whilst the Tribunal notes the evidence that  the  Appellant
                 can speak some Rohingya, it found that if he were  actually
                 Rohingya he would be able to speak that language  fluently,
                 given that he would have spoken nothing else until the  age
                 of six;

              v) It was implausible that  after  many  years  the  Appellant
                 would tell his employer in Bangladesh that he was  Rohingya
                 rather than just telling him  that  he  was  an  orphan  or
                 abandoned as a child;

             vi) The Appellant failed to claim asylum  in  France  and  this
                 diminishes the weight to be attached to his testimony

 7. As to the Competent Authority's finding that the Appellant was a victim
    of trafficking the First-tier Tribunal was  apparently  not  minded  to
    accept it. It is repeatedly described as "odd" [see ï¿½6, 27 and 34]. The
    Respondent's position at  the  hearing  was  that  this  had  been  the
    decision  of  the  Competent  Authority,  reached  applying  the  civil
    standard of proof, and the Respondent did not intend to go  behind  it.
    Although the positive finding had been made, no grant of  discretionary
    leave had ensued. The Tribunal considered that this did not  "fit  into
    what would be expected in these sorts of cases". At  paragraph  27  the
    Tribunal concludes:


         "the account he has given about his journey and time in the  United
         Kingdom is not consistent with being trafficked.  It  is  therefore
         somewhat odd that there is no NRM letter,  no  discretionary  leave
         was granted and yet the refusal conceded this  point  -  a  curious
         concession but I conclude there are no hallmarks of persecution"

 8. The appeal was therefore dismissed on all grounds.


    The Appeal

 9. The parties before me were in agreement that the First-tier  Tribunal's
    findings on the trafficking issue were not sustainable.   Although  the
    Tribunal had not had sight of any  correspondence  from  the  Competent
    Authority (the Respondent having failed to comply with a  direction  to
    produce  it),  there  was  no  dispute  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    recognised as a victim of trafficking. Mrs Pettersen conceded  that  in
    those  circumstances  the  Tribunal's  disparaging  of  the   Competent
    Authority amounted to an error of law. As the Court of Appeal have made
    clear, the Tribunal may only supplant the  decision  of  the  Competent
    Authority with a view of its own where the original decision  has  been
    found to be irrational: Secretary of State for the Home Department v MS
    (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 594.  Persistently describing  the  decision
    as "odd" does not  amount  to  a  reasoned  finding  of  irrationality.
    Neither party was able to shed any light on  Judge  Shergill's  comment
    that the outcome of the trafficking enquiry did not  fit  in  with  his
    experience of these "sorts of cases". As Mrs Pettersen pointed out,  it
    is frequently the case that leave will be refused even where a positive
    Conclusive Grounds decision is reached.


10. The parties were further in agreement that the error in approach to the
    trafficking decision was material.   The Tribunal conducts no  reasoned
    analysis of whether, as a victim of trafficking, the Appellant would be
    at risk upon return to Bangladesh (for that is where he will be removed
    if his  claim  is  not  made  out),  either  because  of  circumstances
    connected to his historical experiences or because  he  would  be  more
    vulnerable in the future. Nor, might I add, does the Tribunal weigh the
    positive Conclusive Grounds decision in the round when considering  the
    overall credibility of the claim.

11. Were that not enough I am further satisfied that the  findings  on  the
    'ethnicity' aspect of the claim are contradictory and  irrational.  The
    Judge appears to reject  the  Appellant's  childhood  memories  on  the
    grounds that he would not be able to recall them, whilst  at  the  same
    time weighing against him the fact that he is no  longer  fluent  in  a
    language that he last spoke  as  a  six-year-old.    Nowhere  does  the
    Tribunal weigh in the Appellant's favour the evidence that he can speak
    some Rohingya; nor does it  consider  how  that  might  be  so  if  the
    Appellant is not, in fact, from that ethnic group.

12. I reject the Appellant's third ground, which is that the Tribunal erred
    in failing to weigh in the balance the Respondent's "failure" to verify
    the camp registration document. The Respondent is under  no  obligation
    to prove the Appellant's case for him. The burden lies on the Appellant
    and this document was not of the species considered in MA(Bangladesh) v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 175.

13. That finding notwithstanding I am satisfied that there  are  sufficient
    grounds to set the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  aside  in  its
    entirety. I note that in granting permission First-tier  Tribunal  Gibb
    expressed some ambivalence about whether there was  any  merit  in  the
    challenge to the Article 8  findings  and  I  share  that  ambivalence.
    Certainly on the facts as found by the Tribunal there was nothing wrong
    with that element of the final decision. I am however mindful that  the
    consequences of the Appellant's trafficking experience  have  not  been
    explored and in those circumstances it  would  not  be  appropriate  to
    fetter his case going forward. I therefore direct that the matter is to
    be determined de novo. Given the extent of the  fact  finding  required
    the most  appropriate  forum  for  that  would  be  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, where the matter must be listed before  a  Judge  other  than
    Judge Shergill.


    Decisions


14. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal  is  flawed  for  material
    error of law and it is set aside.


15. The matter is to be determined de novo by the First-tier Tribunal.


16. There is an order for anonymity.
