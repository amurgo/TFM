For the Appellant:     Mr G Dewar, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent decided to deport the appellant for reasons explained in
    her decision dated 1 February 2016.

 2. Designated FtT  Judge  Murray  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  for
    reasons explained in her decision promulgated on 8 February 2017.


 3. The appellant has permission to appeal  to  the  UT  on  grounds  which
    (lightly edited) run as follows:

      Failure to take relevant evidence into account.

      At paragraph 56 the judge concludes that  the  appellant  is  not  gay
      because, inter alia, "The only evidence I have of him being homosexual
      is his own evidence".

      Apart from the appellant's own witness  evidence  there  was  evidence
      that he has been convicted of a  number  of  sexual  assaults  against
      other men (and none against women). There is also a social work report
      which stated that the appellant "undoubtedly  would  have  experienced
      'sexual thoughts' prior to the offences being committed".  The  author
      of the report is presumably objective and appears to benefit from some
      degree of expertise in the assessment of sexual offenders.

      By failing to consider this evidence and  to  assess  the  appellant's
      evidence in the round with it, the judge materially erred in law.

      Error by imposing requirement of corroboration.

      Further and in any event by dismissing this aspect of the claim due to
      an (alleged) absence of corroboration the judge made a  further  error
      in law by requiring corroboration in  a  jurisdiction  were  this  not
      required.

      Application of incorrect (higher) standard of proof.

      The  judge  in  effect  applied  a  standard  of  proof  higher   than
      "reasonable degree of likelihood"  on  this  point.  The  Home  Office
      decision accepted that the appellant  "may  well  be  gay".  The  Home
      Office made clear that this was not intended as a concession and it is
      accepted that it is does not go as far as an explicit concession  that
      the appellant is gay. However, if any fact "may well" be correct  then
      there must be a "reasonable degree of likelihood" that it is  correct.
      To conclude otherwise is illogical. It is impossible to  see  how  the
      judge  could  have  concluded  otherwise  without  imposing  a  higher
      standard of proof.

      Making a finding that is unreasonable and irrational.

      At paragraph 56 the judge concludes that the appellant did not  commit
      sexual offences against men because he is gay but because "he could be
      bisexual or could be seeking revenge against men for  some  reason  ".
      Neither of these eventualities (based upon speculation in  any  event)
      would absolve him of risk on return to Chad. If driven to seek  sexual
      gratification with men (for whatever reason) he could be  at  risk  of
      persecution in Chad. By apparently concluding that he would not be  at
      risk if bisexual or "seeking revenge against men" the judge  proceeded
      in a manner that is unreasonable and irrational.

      Further failure to take relevant evidence into account and failure  to
      reach conclusion on core aspect of claim.

      At paragraph 64 the judge says "I see no reason why he  would  not  be
      able to get through the airport [on removal to Chad]. I do not believe
      he would be at risk of detention"...  she  has  failed  to  take  into
      account a relevant and material factor...

      In his supplementary witness statement at paragraph  4  the  appellant
      said, "I believe the authorities  of  Chad  would  ask  me  about  [my
      criminal record] at the point of return".

      It was the appellant's case that if  asked  about  this  he  would  be
      exposing himself to a risk of persecution because his criminal  record
      indicates that he is (a) a sex offender and (b) gay. If this creates a
      risk of persecution, he cannot be expected to lie to avoid it ... This
      is not something the judge appears to have  taken  into  account  when
      reaching her conclusion that she sees "no reason" why  he  would  face
      problems at the airport.

      In relation to the same point ... the appellant's  assertion  that  he
      would be asked about such matters by the authorities in  charge  seems
      entirely credible. By analogy, immigration officers in the UK would be
      expected to ask such questions of any returnee to the UK. This went to
      the core of the claim and the judge was obliged to consider the  point
      and reach a conclusion on it. Failure to do so is a further  error  of
      law.

      The appeal should be reheard de  novo  by  a  differently  constituted
      First-tier Tribunal.

 4. The submissions for the appellant were along the lines of the  grounds.
    The main further points which I noted were as follows. It was  accepted
    that although the grounds are set out under 5  headings,  they  overlap
    significantly. The evidence that the appellant is  homosexual  was  not
    only his own. The social enquiry report provided to the High  Court  on
    the appellant is at page Q1 of the  respondent's  bundle.  At  page  Q6
    there is the passage quoted in the grounds. As the author of the report
    observed, the commission of the offences required motivation. This  was
    evidence to support the proposition that the appellant is gay. That was
    the inference which ought to have been drawn. It was not clear what the
    judge meant at paragraph 56. There was also an inference  to  be  drawn
    from the appellant's criminal conduct. The authorities in Chad would in
    any event draw the inference that he was gay, which was  sufficient  to
    give rise to a need for protection. It was  accepted  that  is  not  an
    error that the judge did not include a self-direction on  the  standard
    of proof. The question was the standard of  proof  which  she  applied,
    which was pitched too high in effect at paragraph 56. The  Home  Office
    did not concede that the appellant is gay, but went so far  as  to  say
    that he "may be homosexual".  That could only  logically  be  taken  as
    substantial grounds for believing that he might be, and  as  sufficient
    to meet the lower standard of proof, at  least  a  serious  possibility
    that the appellant is gay. The judge's findings  regarding  what  might
    happen at the airport in Chad failed to take account of the probability
    that the appellant would be questioned on return. It was accepted  that
    the appellant was the only source of evidence about that, but it was an
    obvious likelihood, and although the  appellant  might  have  been  not
    generally credible, it did not follow that  he  might  not  be  correct
    about that.

 5. The presenting officer submitted along these lines. The appellant  said
    that the sentencing report disclosed a  high  probability  that  he  is
    homosexual, but it only says that  he  must  have  experienced  "sexual
    thoughts", not that these were necessarily of a homosexual nature.  The
    judge had been well aware of the issue  between  the  parties  on  this
    point, which she set out carefully at paragraph 6.  It  was  not  shown
    that the appellant's sexual offending necessarily related to his sexual
    orientation. His attitude towards his offending was highly inconsistent
    and unclear. There was no other evidence about his orientation. He gave
    no comprehensible account of either his motivation  or  his  sexuality.
    There was no concession made and no presumption arose.  The  judge  did
    not find the appellant a reliable witness, noted that he had  not  been
    living in the UK "as an openly gay man", and at paragraph 59  expressly
    declined to find that he is homosexual. As to return  to  the  airport,
    there was no reliable evidence of what the authorities  of  Chad  might
    do. It  was  far  from  obvious  that  the  appellant  would  be  asked
    questions.  There  was  no  evidence  that  returnees   under   similar
    circumstances to the UK would be questioned  by  immigration  officers.
    The little evidence there was on the point came  from  someone  who  is
    well established to be a liar.

 6. Mr Dewar in reply said that the key point for the appellant went to the
    standard of proof. The decision did not demonstrate  that  the  correct
    standard had in effect been applied.  There had  been  material  before
    the FtT more than adequate for the appellant to succeed in proving  his
    sexual orientation. Applying the correct standard to the evidence,  the
    judge could logically have drawn only one conclusion.

 7. I reserved my decision.

 8. The respondent said that the appellant  might  be  gay,  but  expressly
    stopped short of a concession, to the lower standard.  The respondent's
    letter written in course of proceedings (27 September  2016)  took  the
    position that although convicted of a number of violent sexual assaults
    against men, a distinction was to be drawn between  those  matters  and
    his sexual orientation.

 9. The respondent's point was made in a particular context,  both  in  the
    original decision and in  the  further  correspondence:  "While  it  is
    accepted you may well be homosexual, it is not considered  there  is  a
    significant risk that you would come to harm because of  this  on  your
    return to Chad".  That aspect  has  rather  been  lost  sight  of;  the
    evaluation was in the alternative that the appellant might be gay.  For
    completeness, that was a necessary part of the  respondent's  decision-
    making.

10. In any jurisdiction, particular facts in contention  may  be  shown  to
    varying  degrees,  from  the  faintest  of  possibilities  to   virtual
    certainty.  What the tribunal had  to  do  was  to  apply  the  correct
    standard to the overall decisive issue.

11. The respondent's position did not require the judge to  find  that  the
    appellant had established  his  homosexual  orientation  to  the  lower
    standard of proof.  It was for her to gauge the degree of  possibility.



12. The nature of the offending was not conceded to speak for itself as  to
    the appellant's sexual  orientation.   I  do  not  think  it  has  been
    contended that the offending obliged the judge to find in his favour on
    the issue.  In any event, her decision explains why she  did  not  find
    that point conclusive.

13. The social enquiry report is not a separate source of evidence that the
    appellant is gay, but at best a commentary upon the evidence.   It  was
    there to be considered, but its terms offer no real additional  support
    to the proposition that the appellant is  gay.   The  author  does  not
    purport to say that the perpetrator of such offences must be so.

14. There may have been evidence by which the judge could  have  found  one
    way or the other  on  the  appellant's  orientation,  but  it  was  not
    evidence by which she was bound to come to  only  one  conclusion,  and
    there was no error in coming down on the side she did.

15. In any event, the appellant's sexual orientation was  not  decisive  of
    his case.

16. The judge found no evidence that in Chad  the  appellant  would  behave
    openly as a gay man, or that anyone would know about or  be  interested
    in his sexuality.  At the date of the hearing,  homosexuality  was  not
    illegal in Chad.  No error has been shown in those conclusions.

17. The evidence that the appellant might be questioned at the  airport  on
    return to Chad (leading him to disclose his convictions) was as  skimpy
    as it could be, no more than his own (convenient) guess.

18. Even if there had been some realistic evidence that the authorities  in
    Chad question citizens whose return is enforced, it is far  from  clear
    that the appellant would be entitled to have  his  case  considered  on
    that basis.  The appellant did not develop  this  aspect  of  his  case
    either in the FtT or in the UT,  but  refusal  to  return  voluntarily,
    where that course is available, does not qualify for protection,  as  a
    matter of general principle.

19. (On that point, see e.g. Macdonald's Immigration Law and Practice,  9th
    ed., �12.24, citing AA v SSHD, LK v SSHD [2006] EWCA  Civ  401,  [2006]
    NLJR 681, [2007] 1 WLR 3134.  Put another way, "A person cannot rely on
    their own failings (as where they do not co-operate in  securing  valid
    travel documentation) to obtain international protection":  Macdonald's
    Immigration Law and Practice, 9th ed., �12.28, citing HF v SSHD  (Iraq)
    [2013] EWCA Civ 1276.)

20. There is no reason to think that the appellant might not, if he  chose,
    return  to  Chad  in  his   true   identity   on   regularly   obtained
    documentation.

21. In short, the judge was not bound to find that the  appellant  is  gay;
    made no error in declining so to find; and in any event, even if he had
    established that he is gay, the appellant failed to make the case  that
    his orientation placed him at risk on  return  to  Chad,  arising  from
    questioning at the airport, or otherwise.

22. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

23. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
