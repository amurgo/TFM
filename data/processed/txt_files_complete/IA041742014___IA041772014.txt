                                                                 Respondents


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Shilliday
For the Respondents:   Ms Mallick


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Mr Greene is a citizen of the Republic of Ireland born  in  1964.   Mrs
    Sterling is a citizen of Jamaica  born  in  1960.   Mr  Green  appealed
    against a decision of the Secretary of State made on 18  December  2013
    to refuse to issue a  permanent  residence  card  because  he  did  not
    satisfy the requirements of regulation 15(1) of the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.  Mrs Sterling appealed  against  a  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State to refuse to issue a  permanent  residence  card  as
    family member of an EEA national.

 2. Although in proceedings  before  me  the  Secretary  of  State  is  the
    Appellant, for convenience I refer to the parties as they  were  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.  Thus, Mr Greene  is  the  'first  Appellant',
    (hereafter simply 'the Appellant'), Mrs Sterling the 'second Appellant'
    and the Secretary of State 'the Respondent'.

 3. In respect of the Appellant the Respondent noted the claim that he  was
    a qualified person for a continuous five year period but  that  he  had
    ceased to be a worker due to  permanent  incapacity.   The  Respondent,
    however, was not satisfied that the Appellant was  a  worker  or  self-
    employed for two  years  before  he  had  ceased  activity  (regulation
    15(1)(c)). Also, that  he  was  permanently  incapacitated  (regulation
    5(3)).  The Respondent also considered that he posed a  threat  to  the
    requirements of public policy if allowed to remain in the UK.

 4. The application in respect of the second Appellant as family member  of
    an EEA national was refused in line  under  15(1)(d)  because  her  EEA
    national partner was not a  worker  or  self-employed  person  who  had
    ceased activity.

 5. They appealed.

 6. Following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 21 August and  23  October  2014
    Judge of the First-tier Adio allowed the appeals under the  Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations.

 7. Paragraph 15 (1) states that the 'following people  shall  acquire  the
    right to reside in the UK permanently-

         '...

         (c) a worker or self employed person who has ceased activity;

         (d) the family member of a worker or self employed person  who  has
         ceased activity; '

 8. His findings are at paragraphs [30]ff.  He considered  the  application
    of  regulation  5  'worker  or  self-employed  person  who  has  ceased
    activity'.

         Regulations 5(3) reads:

             'A person satisfies the conditions in this paragraph if -

             (a)  he terminates his activity in the  United  Kingdom  as  a
                  worker or self-employed person as a result of a  permanent
                  incapacity to work; and

             (b)  ...

                  (i)  he resided in the  United  Kingdom  continuously  for
                      more than two years prior to the termination ...'

 9. Looking first at 5(3)(b) the judge  noted  that  'there  is  no  single
    document which gives a definite period  of  employment  for  the  first
    Appellant" in the UK, however, there were documents indicating that  he
    was registered with HMRC.  Also, a letter from HMRC dated 15 April 2012
    'which notes that he did not send in his tax return for the year ending
    February 2011 in time and was therefore liable to a fine of ï¿½100' [30].

10. The judge also noted that the Appellant had submitted an Inland Revenue
    registration  card  and  an  identification   card   for   'underground
    railways'.  He further noted oral evidence and  a  statement  from  the
    Appellant that he recollected working at the Arndale  Halifax  shopping
    centre in 1980 for about five years and that he later  worked  for  the
    underground for about six years but cannot remember a lot.   He  thinks
    he stopped working about 2007. He did not have his P60 and P45 as  they
    had been left behind when he had to move out of where he was previously
    living.

11. The judge also noted oral evidence  from  the  second  Appellant  that,
    having met him in 2007 he was working in a steel fixing company. He had
    worked up to 2008 when he stopped when he became ill.

12. The judge concluded 'Bearing in mind (his) alcohol and drug problems  I
    find it credible that it is possible he has mixed up  a  lot  of  dates
    with regards to his employment that due to the fact that he had to move
    out of a property that he did not have documents with him' [31].

13. Further, 'Taking the totality of evidence before me I  am  prepared  to
    find on the balance of probability that (he) would have  worked  for  a
    period of two years in the United Kingdom.  I have taken  into  account
    the oral evidence albeit that there is a problem with (him) remembering
    exactly the period he started and stopped working but  there  are  some
    documents which show that (he) has worked in the United Kingdom.  (His)
    partner also recollected that he has  worked  in  the  United  Kingdom'
    [32].

14. Turning to consider whether the Appellant had terminated  his  activity
    as a result of permanent incapacity the judge appeared to  accept  that
    the Appellant's problems started with depression in 2006 following  his
    mother's death from cancer.  He noted in that regard a  medical  letter
    from SW London and St George's Mental Health NHS Trust dated 4 November
    2008 which also stated he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act  in
    Ireland and was under the care  of  Fulham  CMHT  for  several  months.
    Further, that he was reported as having slashed and  stabbed  his  arms
    and also tried to hang himself as well as taking overdoses  of  tablets
    [33].

15. The judge noted  that  the  writer  of  that  letter  stated  that  the
    Appellant's history suggests that he has  'longstanding  mental  health
    issues for which he has not been treated currently'.   The  doctor  was
    concerned about his mental state and medium to long term  risk  issues.
    Although that medical letter and another dated 30  June  2012  did  not
    state that he is permanently  incapacitated,  (the  latter  from  a  GP
    stating 'in view of his longstanding history of  psychiatric  problems,
    drug and alcohol dependence...his incapacity is a very longstanding one
    and may even be permanent'), the judge considering the medical  letters
    in combination, along with the Appellant's evidence concluded that such
    'indicate that he has not been able to work as a  result  of  permanent
    incapacity to work.  I have taken into account the  piecemeal  evidence
    before me and the quality of evidence indicates that the reason why the
    Appellant has not been able to work in the UK since 2007 onwards is due
    to being permanently incapacitated from working as a result of  a  long
    history of psychiatric problems, drug and alcohol dependence' [34].

16. The judge concluded on this matter: 'My judgment of the opinion of  the
    medical  staff  in  stating  that  the  Appellant's  incapacity  is   a
    longstanding one and may even be permanent should be equated  as  being
    one which is permanent as the reality of  the  situation  is  that  the
    Appellant is  unable  to  return  to  work  according  to  the  medical
    evidence' [35].  He thus satisfied Regulation 5(3) and 15 (1) (c)  with
    the result that the second Appellant succeeded under 15 (1) (d).

17. He also found that the Respondent  was  wrong  to  refuse  to  issue  a
    residence card on the grounds of public policy.

18. The Respondent sought permission to appeal which was granted by a judge
    on 16 December 2014.

19. At the error of law hearing before me Mr Shilliday relied solely on the
    grounds, in effect, that on the evidence no reasonable  tribunal  could
    have accepted the Appellant's case as to 'two years employment',  'self
    employment, or 'permanent incapacity'.  The judge had either misapplied
    the standard of proof or reached conclusions which were not open to him
    on the evidence in respect of the claim that the Appellant was employed
    or self-employed for two years.  There was effectively  no  documentary
    evidence.  The only testimony was that of the Appellant who  the  judge
    had accepted has memory problems. The  second  Appellant  had  repeated
    what she was told by him.

20. As for permanent  incapacity  the  judge  had  concluded  that  as  the
    Appellant's  incapacity  is  longstanding  such  equates  to  permanent
    incapacity.  Such a conclusion  on  the  evidence  was  not  made  out.
    Further, he is receiving care which is aimed at his recovery and  there
    is nothing  to  suggest  that  treatment  is  merely  to  maintain  his
    condition.  Moreover, the judge indicated that the Appellant is 'now on
    his way back to being rehabilitated in society with the support of  his
    partner' [39].  Such is contradicted by  his  earlier  finding  of  the
    Appellant 'being permanently incapacitated from working as a result  of
    a long history of psychiatric problems, drug  and  alcohol  dependence'
    [34].  Mr Shilliday invited me to set aside the decision and remake  it
    by dismissing it.

21. Ms Mallick referred me to a skeleton argument.  In summary  the  appeal
    by the Respondent is on the grounds of perversity.   The  threshold  is
    high.  The reality was  that  the  Respondent's  position  amounted  to
    disagreement  with  the  decision.   The  judge's  findings  about  the
    Appellant' work were supported by oral evidence  from  him  given  some
    support by the second Appellant.  Whilst it may have been largely  what
    he told her it was relevant and allowed her to give  evidence  to  that
    effect.

22. The judge also relied on documentary evidence in support of  the  claim
    to have worked.  There was no requirement for corroboration.  Also,  he
    accepted the Appellant's  account  as  to  why  there  was  a  lack  of
    documents.

23. On the issue of permanent incapacity the judge was entitled to find  on
    the evidence that the Appellant suffered from depression in  2006,  was
    sectioned,  self-harmed  and  that  the  mental  health   illness   was
    longstanding.  Also a medical opinion that the prognosis was of  medium
    to long term risk. Further, a medical letter (30 June 2012) that he was
    not able to work.  There was enough by way of personal history, medical
    evidence and oral evidence to allow the  judge  to  conclude  that  the
    Appellant had a longstanding illness and was permanently incapacitated.

24. In considering this matter I look first  at  the  judge's  approach  to
    whether the Appellant had shown two years work or  self  employment  in
    the UK before cessation of activity.  He noted the correct  burden  and
    standard of proof.  He noted that there was no single document giving a
    definite period of employment  and  that  documentation  generally  was
    slight: registration with HMRC, a penalty notice for failing to provide
    a tax return for 2011, an identification card for London Underground.

25. Despite the dearth of documentary support the judge  having  heard  the
    oral evidence of the Appellant, accepted  it.   In  summary,  that  the
    Appellant worked for a shopping centre for some years.  He then  worked
    for London Underground in station maintenance for six years until 2007.
     He then worked for a steel  fixing  company  in  London  and  that  he
    stopped  because  he  was  ill.   He  was  not  able  to  produce  more
    significant documents such as P60 and P45 because these had  been  left
    behind because he was messed up by medication and had  been  threatened
    out of his accommodation. The second Appellant gave evidence in support
    albeit that that evidence was mostly what the Appellant had  told  her,
    they having met in 2007 but  also  for  a  year  or  so  from  her  own
    knowledge until he left his last job because of illness.

26. There is no requirement for  corroboration  (see  ST  (Corroboration  -
    Kasolo) Ethiopia [2004]  UKIAT  00119.   However,  'where  evidence  to
    support an account given by a party is or should readily be  available,
    a judge is, in my view, plainly  entitled  to  take  into  account  the
    failure to provide that evidence and any explanation for that  failure'
    [15].

27. In this case the judge did not simply rely on oral evidence.   He  also
    relied on some, albeit limited, documentary evidence in  particular  in
    support  of  his  claim  to  have  worked   for   London   Underground.
    Significantly, he accepted the Appellant's account as to why there  was
    a lack of documents namely the mess to his life caused  by  his  mental
    health condition, and his medication. Also, that he had left  behind  a
    lot of documents in previous accommodation because he  was  'threatened
    out of the property' [10]

28. On the issue of permanent  incapacity  the  judge  concluded  that  the
    Appellant had suffered from depression from 2006 and that he  had  been
    sectioned under the Mental Health Act.  Also he had had tried  to  kill
    himself.   He  concluded  from  the  medical  letter  that  gave   that
    information (4 November  2008)  that,  as  the  doctor  indicated,  the
    Appellant had longstanding mental health problems and  that  there  was
    medium to long term risk of his continuing to suffer from mental health
    issues.

29. He also noted a later letter (30 June 2012) from a GP  which  concluded
    'In view of his longstanding history of psychiatric problems, drug  and
    alcohol dependence, in (the doctor's opinion) his incapacity is a  very
    longstanding one and may even be permanent'. I find  no  merit  in  the
    ground (not raised orally) that the  writers  of  the  letters,  one  a
    doctor from the Wandsworth Community Drug  Team,  part  of  the  Mental
    Health Trust, and a GP were  not  sufficiently  senior  to  give  their
    opinions.

30. The judge concluded that 'the combination of the  letters'  along  with
    the evidence of the Appellant 'indicate that he has not  been  able  to
    work as a result of  permanent  incapacity  to  work'.   He  took  into
    account the 'piecemeal evidence' before him and the quality of evidence
    which 'indicates that the reason why (he) has not been able to work  in
    the UK onwards is due to being permanently incapacitated  from  working
    as a result of a long history of psychiatric problems, drug and alcohol
    dependence'.  Further, his judgment of the opinion of the medical staff
    in stating that the Appellant's incapacity is a 'longstanding  one  and
    may even be permanent should be equated as being one which is permanent
    as the reality of the situation is that the Appellant is unable to work
    according to the medical evidence'.

31. The Respondent appeals on the grounds of perversity/irrationality.  The
    threshold is high.  Perversity amounting to an  error  of  law  can  be
    established if the 'decision is one to  which  no  reasonable  decision
    maker, properly instructing himself on the law could have come  on  the
    evidence before him' (Miftari v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 481).

32. Mere disagreement with a Tribunal decision is far from  sufficient  for
    an Appellate Tribunal to be satisfied that the original conclusions  on
    the merits were perverse. As the court said in  KU  (Pakistan)  v  SSHD
    [2012] EWCA Civ 391 (at [17]) 'the  fact  that  a  contrary  conclusion
    could properly have been reached did  not  mean  that  the  Immigration
    Judge's conclusion in paragraph 25 was perverse.'

33. On the issue of employment the judge's findings were supported by  oral
    evidence.  He did  not  simply  rely  on  oral  evidence  but  on  some
    documentary evidence in  particular  that  he  has  worked  for  London
    Underground.  He accepted the Appellant's account as to why there was a
    lack of documents in support.

34. I consider that the judge made findings that were open to him to  reach
    on the evidence before  him.   The  grounds  amount  to  no  more  than
    disagreement  with  the  judge.   There  is  nothing  perverse  in  his
    decision.

35. Nor  did  the  judge  make  a  perverse  decision  in  finding  that  a
    longstanding illness that has  resulted  in  the  Appellant  not  doing
    employed work since 2007, amounted to permanent incapacity.  The  judge
    had evidence from doctors competent  to  comment,  of  his  psychiatric
    condition, his history of battling with his condition and oral evidence
    as to why he could not work.  There  was  enough  by  way  of  personal
    history, medical documentary evidence and oral  evidence  that  allowed
    the  judge  to  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the  Appellant  had  a
    longstanding illness  and  was  permanently  incapacitated  within  the
    meaning  of  regulation  5(3).  The  comment  that  he  is  trying   to
    rehabilitate himself does not detract from his conclusion. It  may  be,
    particularly in this aspect of the claim, that the judge's decision was
    generous and a  different  tribunal  might  have  reached  a  different
    decision. However, his conclusion  that  all  the  evidence  points  to
    permanent incapacity was, again, one he was entitled to  reach  on  the
    evidence before him.  Again, the grounds amount to  mere  disagreement.
    The threshold of perversely is not reached.

36. On the grounds pleaded and argued by the Respondent I conclude that the
    judge's decision allowing the appeals is sustainable for the reasons he
    gave.
