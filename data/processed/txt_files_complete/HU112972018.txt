                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Woolley promulgated on the 29th October 2018 whereby the
    judge dismissed the appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent to refuse the  appellant  indefinite  or  further  leave  to
    remain in the UK as a partner under Appendix FM  and  thereafter  under
    family life rights based on Article 8 of the ECHR.

 2. I have considered whether or not it is appropriate to make an anonymity
    direction. Having considered all the circumstances I do not consider it
    necessary to do so.

 3. Leave to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge E M  Simpson  on  20th  November  2018.  Thus  the  case
    appeared before me to determine whether or not  there  was  a  material
    error of law in the decision.

    Factual background

 4. The appellant is a citizen of Nepal born  on  12  September  1993.  The
    appellant had entered the United Kingdom on 26 June 2015 with leave  us
    a spouse valid from 13 May 2015 until 13 February 2018.

 5. On 24 January 2018 the appellant had made an application ostensibly for
    indefinite leave to remain under appendix FM and on the basis of family
    life under article 8.

 6. The appellant continues to reside with her husband, the sponsor of  her
    original application. It is not suggested that  their  relationship  is
    anything other than  genuine  and  subsisting.  The  appellant  can  be
    accommodated without recourse to public  funds.  The  appellant  speaks
    English. It was conceded in the refusal letter that the  appellant  met
    all the requirements under the suitability criteria of Appendix FM.

 7. With regard to the requirements for indefinite leave to remain  it  was
    pointed out that the appellant had  not  completed  at  least  5  years
    continuous residence in the United Kingdom as a partner or  the  longer
    period of continuous period of residence at  least  10  years  required
    otherwise.

 8. In respect of the requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE  the  appellant  had
    failed to produce the required documentation for the  six-month  period
    prior to the application.

 9. The grounds for refusing the appellant indefinite leave are clearly set
    out within the refusal letter and include the fact that  the  appellant
    did not  meet  time  periods  prescribed  within  the  rules  and  that
    otherwise the appellant did not meet the requirements  with  regard  to
    Appendix FM-SE.

10. The appellant had appealed and the appeal had as indicated  above  been
    heard by Judge Woolley who found that the appellant did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the rules, specifically with regard to Appendix  FM-SE,
    that the  documentation  to  be  submitted  to  substantiate  that  the
    appellant did not met the requirements of the rules.

11. The judge went on to consider whether  or  not  the  appeal  should  be
    allowed otherwise under family life on article 8 grounds. In seeking to
    deal with family life the judge has referred to a significant number of
    cases including MM & Ors v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ.

12. In the submissions the appellant's representative seek to rely  amongst
    other things upon the case of MM in the Supreme Court [MM  (Lebanon)  v
    SSHD [2017] UKSC 10], specifically paragraph 99 thereof provides:-

         99.      Operation of the same  restrictive  approach  outside  the
         rules is a different matter, and in our view is much more difficult
         to justify under the HRA. This  is  not  because  'less  intrusive'
         methods might be devised (as Blake J  attempted  to  do:  paragraph
         147),  but  because  it  is  inconsistent  with  the  character  of
         evaluation which article 8 requires. As has been  seen  avoiding  a
         financial burden on the state can be relevant to the  fair  balance
         required by the article. But  that  judgement  cannot  properly  be
         constrained by rigid restriction in the rules.  Certainly,  nothing
         that is said in the instructions to case officers can  prevent  the
         tribunal on appeal from looking at the matter more  broadly.  These
         are not matters of  policy  on  which  special  weight  has  to  be
         accorded to the judgement of  the  Secretary  of  State.  There  is
         nothing to prevent the tribunal, in the context of HRA appeal, from
         judging for  itself  the  reliability  of  alternative  sources  of
         finance in the light of the evidence before it...

13. It was accepted before me that whilst the appellant may not be entitled
    to indefinite leave to remain on the basis of Article  8  family  life,
    the appellant's and her husband's right to family life under article  8
    should be recognised and the appellant should be entitled to some  form
    of leave.

14.  It was accepted before me that the broader approach advocated  in  the
    case of MM with regard to the financial requirements of the  rules  had
    not been considered by Judge Woolley in assessing the Article 8  rights
    to family life of the appellant and her spouse. Whilst  the  judge  had
    considered the guidance in the Court of Appeal clearly the guidance  in
    the Supreme Court as identified was relevant.

15. In assessing the financial requirements of the rules it had been  found
    by the judge that not only did the appellant herself earn some  �17,269
    but that her partner had an income  of  over  �34,000.  Whilst  it  was
    correct to say that the appellant  and  her  sponsor  partner  had  not
    submitted the required documents under appendix FM-SE  for  the  period
    prior to the application, the evidence from the decision to the date of
    the hearing otherwise was sufficient to show  that  the  earnings  were
    genuine. In part the problem may be rather than showing income for  the
    period for 6 months prior to the date of the application  most  of  the
    evidence produced related to post the application. However the evidence
    did confirm the considerable  income  not  only  on  the  part  of  the
    appellant herself but on the part of her sponsor. Thus whilst they  did
    not meet the evidential requirements set out in appendix  FM-SE,  there
    was more than sufficient evidence to prove otherwise the income level.

16. With regard to other factors it was noted that the appellant had  given
    evidence in English without any difficulty.

17. On behalf of the respondent it was accepted that the  broader  approach
    advocated in MM Supreme Court had not been  applied  in  assessing  the
    article 8 rights of the appellant and her partner.

18. I find that  the  judge  has  failed  to  apply  the  broader  approach
    advocated in MM in assessing the article 8 rights of the appellant  and
    her spouse. In looking at that broader approach I find the  failure  by
    the judge to apply that broader approach is such as  to  constitute  an
    error of law on the part the judge.

19. I indicated to the parties that I saw no reason why  in  the  light  of
    that that I need to make any comment with regard to the 2nd  ground  of
    appeal.

20. I asked the respondent's representative how best this appeal  could  be
    determined. It was accepted that if I saw fit to determine  the  appeal
    on the basis of the evidence before me and the findings of fact made by
    the judge applying the broader approach, I would be able to  deal  with
    the appeal without hearing further  evidence.  In  effect  I  would  be
    determining the matter on the basis of the article 8 family life rights
    of the appellant and her spouse.

21. The appellant's representative accepted  that  the  appellant  was  not
    entitled to indefinite leave to remain on the basis of the  immigration
    rules but accepted that applying a broader  approach  within  MM  would
    recognise the appellant's rights under article 8 and  that  that  would
    entitle the appellant to have some form  of  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom.

22. In the event and I therefore determine that there was an error  of  law
    in the assessment of the appellant's article 8 rights and the article 8
    rights of her spouse and that I was able to deal with the case  on  the
    basis of the evidence before me.

23. On the basis of  the  evidence  before  me  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    appellant has a significant and substantial family life in  the  United
    Kingdom with her husband. I am satisfied that the decision sufficiently
    and significantly interferes with that family life. Whilst the decision
    is in accordance with the law  and  for  the  purposes  of  maintaining
    immigration control as an aspect of economic well-being of the country,
    I have to consider whether  or  not  the  decision  is  proportionately
    justified in all the circumstances.

24. Taking account of the fact that the appellant entered on the  basis  of
    her relationship with her spouse; that she is able  to  speak  English;
    that she and her spouse earn sufficient to support  themselves  without
    recourse to public funds; that the couple are accommodated without  any
    problem;  that  they  have  both  settled  lifestyles  with  regard  to
    employment being in settled occupations and  otherwise;  and  that  the
    appellant is clearly become integrated into the United Kingdom settling
    into lifestyle with a husband, I find for the reasons set out that  the
    decision is not proportionately justified.

25. I find that the appellant's rights to family life in the United Kingdom
    are breached and that the appropriate step is to allow  the  appeal  on
    article 8 grounds.

    Notice of Decision

26. I allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds.
