For the Appellant:     Mr P Saini, Counsel, instructed by Hanson Young
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a national of Pakistan born on 20 November  1982.   He
    appealed against the respondent's decision dated  27  October  2014  to
    refuse his application dated 28 August 2014 for leave to  remain  as  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and to remove him from the United Kingdom
    under Section 47 of the 2006 Act.   First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Talbot
    dismissed the appellant's appeal in a  determination  dated  20  August
    2015.   Permission  to  appeal  was  initially  refused  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Hollingworth on 19 January 2016.  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Grubb granted the appellant permission to appeal  stating  that  it  is
    arguable whether  the  judge  properly  considered  that  the  evidence
    actually submitted did or did not predate 11 July 2014 and whether  his
    conclusion  in  relation  to  whether  the  website  was  or  was   not
    established is flawed.

2.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge  made  the  following  findings  which  I
    paraphrase.  The judge's findings are found primarily in paragraphs  11
    and 12 of the decision.  He stated at paragraph 11  that  there  is  no
    indication that any of these advertising items were published before 11
    July 2014.  The appellant claims that additional advertising  materials
    were submitted with the  application  that  the  respondent  failed  to
    consider.  The  problem  for  the  appellant  is  that  none  of  these
    materials show that they were produced or published prior  to  11  July
    2015. The appellant places particular emphasis on his  website  and  on
    advertising media.  The problem is that there is no evidence as to when
    this website went live.  The  appellant  asked  me  to  accept  on  the
    balance of probabilities that the website went live before 11 July 2014
    given that the business had existed since 29 May 2014.  He  pointed  to
    contracts  dated  20  June  2014  and  invoices  as  evidence  of   the
    appellant's  trading  activity.   However,  neither  invoices  nor  the
    contracts display the website address unlike the later invoices and the
    judge found this  to  be  surprising  that  if  the  website  had  been
    operational at that time and in the absence of any adequate evidence he
    could not therefore accept that the appellant's claim that the  website
    went live prior to 11 July 2015.  He concluded that given the  lack  of
    evidence that any of the advertising materials predated  that  date  he
    must  conclude  that  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  had  not  been
    fulfilled.

3.   At paragraph 12 he sets out that the Immigration  Rules  are  extremely
    detailed and prescriptive and this means that applicants may feel  that
    the consequences of them which are particularly harsh.  The  particular
    Rule  change  which  has  affected  the  appellant  was  introduced  in
    Parliament by a minister  to  have  almost  immediate  effect  and  was
    clearly intended as a further tightening up of the  Rules.   He  states
    that this does  not  render  the  respondent's  decision  unlawful  and
    dismissed the appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules.

4.   The grounds of appeal state in summary  that  the  appellant  submitted
    the required specified documents in line with  the  Immigration  Rules.
    They state that the fact that the business had been incorporated  since
    May 2014 speaks volumes  and  highlights  the  appellant's  ability  to
    conduct business and full use of his leave to remain.  The  appellant's
    business plan and market  research  are  comprehensive.   He  has  done
    extensive market research and provided his marked research and analysis
    to the  respondent.   They  have  got  other  challenges  such  as  the
    respondent's duty of evidential  flexibility  and  that  there  was  no
    period of time which the applicants had  to  abide  by  the  new  Rules
    because there was no transition period.

5.   At the hearing I heard submissions from  both  parties  as  to  whether
    there was an error of law in the determination.  I  will  not  set  out
    these submissions but the full notes of  these  are  in  my  Record  of
    Proceedings.

        Findings as to whether there is an error of law

6.   Now my findings as  to  whether  there  is  an  error  of  law  in  the
    determination.  The judge's findings are essentially made at  paragraph
    11.  He states that the appellant had not provided  any  evidence  that
    his business had been established or running prior  to  11  July  2014.
    The judge noted that there were several invoices  as  evidence  of  his
    trading activities and  said  that  neither  these  nor  the  contracts
    display the website address unlike the later invoices.

7.   Essentially the judge did not take into account  the  invoice  dated  6
    June 2014 for graphic and print design (letterhead,  leaflet,  business
    card  and   marketing):   online   advertisements,   printing,   domain
    registration,  one  year  hosting,  website  design   and   development
    amounting to �791.54.  The judge noted that there is no evidence but in
    fact there was evidence.  There was evidence of that invoice  and  most
    importantly there was also evidence of the appellant.  The appellant in
    his witness statement stated that he  had  advertised  on  the  website
    before  that  date.   The  judge  seemed  not  to  have  accepted   the
    appellant's evidence as evidence and gave no reasons  for  why  he  did
    not. The appellant's evidence is as good as any other evidence,  unless
    there is reason not to believe him.  Coupled with the invoice which was
    not considered by the judge's determination,  I  do  not  consider  the
    determination to be safe.  I therefore set aside the determination  and
    remake the decision.

         The re-making of the decision

8.   The  evidence  is  that  the  appellant  made  an  application  for  an
    entrepreneur visa on 20 August 2014.  He was not  represented  when  he
    made his application.  In  support  of  his  application  he  submitted
    evidence  of  invoices  and  evidence  in  his  witness  statement   to
    demonstrate that his business had been advertised and  marketed  before
    11 July 2014 which is one of the requirements of the immigration rules.
    The invoice dated 6 June 2014 for graphic and print design (letterhead,
    leaflet, business card and marketing): online advertisements, printing,
    domain registration, one year hosting, website design  and  development
    amounting to �791.54 demonstrates that the appellant had  marketed  and
    advertised his business before that date. There is no reason for me not
    to accept the appellant's evidence that he had  indeed  advertised  and
    marketed his business before 11 July 2014.

 9.  I  therefore  find,  on  a  balance  of  probabilities  I  accept  the
    appellant's evidence that the advertising and marketing was done before
    11 July 2014.   I  therefore  remake  the  decision  and  I  allow  the
    appellant's appeal as I find  that  the  appellant  has  satisfied  the
    requirements of the immigration rules for further leave  to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom as an entrepreneur.

10. Mr Saini  indicated  at  the  hearing  that  he  had  said  that  Judge
    Hollingworth said that the appeal was out of time when in fact  it  was
    timely made.


11. The upshot is that the decision of the first-tier  Tribunal  dismissing
    the appellant's appeal is set aside as it is  materially  erroneous  in
    law and I remake the decision allowing the appellant's appeal.
