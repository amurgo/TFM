                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The claimants are members of the same family and are  all  citizens  of
    Pakistan.  They sought entry clearance as  family  members  of  an  EEA
    national.  This matter comes before me for consideration as to  whether
    or not there was a material error of law in the determination by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Newberry (FTJ) who allowed the appeals in his  /her
    determination promulgated on 8 May 2014.  The Secretary of State is the
    appellant in these proceedings and for ease of reference I shall  refer
    to the parties as the Secretary of State and the claimants.

Background

2.   The claimants made applications to visit the sponsor, Mr  Rao  Muhammad
    Ali Khan who was married to Maria Ali Khan an EEA national from Poland.
     The application was supported by copies of passports, bank  statements
    in the name of the  sponsor  Mr  Muhammad  Khan  and  accounts  for  HB
    Services International Limited a company in which the sponsor  and  his
    wife are directors.

3.   In reasons for refusal dated  25  June  2013  the  Secretary  of  State
    refused the applications under Regulation 12 of the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.  Specifically the Entry Clearance  Officer  found  no
    evidence of the claimed relationship with the sponsor  and/or  evidence
    of financial dependence.  The same reason was  given  in  each  of  the
    refusal decisions.  In a  review  dated  21  November  2013  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager  took  into  account  documents  submitted  with  the
    application together with documents submitted with the appeal.  He  was
    not satisfied that the sponsor qualified as an EEA national;  he  is  a
    national of Pakistan and a family member of an EEA national and he  has
    a residency card.  The evidence of financial dependency was limited and
    the claimants have not fully addressed the concerns raised by the Entry
    Clearance Officer.


4.   In a determination promulgated on 8 May 2014 Judge Newbury allowed  the
    appeals finding that there was evidence to show that the claimants were
    related to the sponsor as claimed and were financially dependent on the
    sponsor who made funds available.  [10 &11].

Grounds of Appeal

5.   The Secretary of State argued firstly, that  the  FTJ  failed  to  take
    into account a material matter namely that the proposed sponsor for the
    purposes of the application was a Pakistani national who was the spouse
    of an EEA national who does  not  qualify  as  an  EEA  national  under
    Regulation 12.

6.    Secondly,  the  FTJ  failed  to  correctly  apply  the  provisions  in
    Regulation 12 in that it is the circumstances of the EEA  national  who
    should be assessed not those of the sponsor.  There was no  independent
    evidence to show the sponsor's wife was earning �1,000 per month and/or
    that she was exercising treaty rights.

Permission to Appeal

7.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Shimmin granted permission  on  28  May  2014
    concluding that it was arguable that the judge erred in that:

    (1)  the sponsor  was  a  Pakistani  national  and  spouse  of  an  EEA
         national; the ECM states that the sponsor does not  qualify  as  an
         EEA national; the judge made no finding on this matter;


    (2)  the judge failed to correctly apply the provisions  of  Regulation
         12.  He assessed the circumstances of the non-EEA national and  not
         the EEA national; the evidence  was  insufficient  to  support  the
         finding in respect of the EEA national and the claimants failed  to
         establish dependency on the EEA national.


The error of law Hearing

8.   Mr Duffy relied on the grounds of the appeal.   It  was  accepted  that
    the sponsor was the spouse of an EEA national and that he himself had a
    residence card that recognised that the  EEA  national  was  exercising
    treaty rights.  He accepted  Regulation 7(1)(a-c) (2006 Regulations)  a
    "family member" included the spouse of  an  EEA  national.   The  issue
    concerning the Secretary of State was the judge's failure  to  consider
    evidence to show that  Treaty  Rights  were  being  exercised  and  his
    failure to engage  with  evidence  to  show  the  EEA  national  was  a
    qualified person.

9.   Mr  Rao  Muhammad  Ali  Khan,  sponsor,  attended  the  hearing  .   He
    submitted that the Tribunal Judge had taken into account  the  evidence
    of accounts showing that his wife  Mrs  Khan,  the  EEA  national,  was
    exercising Treaty Rights as a self-employed person.  He submitted  that
    he adduced evidence to meet the concerns  raised  in  the  Reasons  for
    Refusal Letter and Entry Clearance  Manager's  review.   Should  it  be
    necessary  he  would  be  able  to  submit  further  evidence  such  as
    documentation concerning taxation from HMRC.

10.  Mr Duffy responded that there was no independent  evidence  to  confirm
    Mrs Khan's self-employment.

11.  I indicated to Mr Duffy that the issue of  the  EEA  national  being  a
    "qualified person" was not  specifically  raised  in  the  Reasons  for
    Refusal Letter and  the determination  made no reference to the  issues
    being  raised  at  the  hearing  where  the  sponsor  was  not  legally
    represented.  Mr Duffy accepted that the matter  was  not  specifically
    raised in either the  Reasons  for  Refusal  Letter  or  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager.  He argued that it was a  standard  requirement  and
    approach in EEA cases, that the parties must always establish that  the
    EEA national is a qualified person exercising treaty rights.  Mr  Duffy
    posed the possibility of an adjournment of the error of law hearing  so
    that the sponsor could produce independent evidence to  establish  that
    his wife was a qualified person.  I pointed out that this would  amount
    to the introduction of new evidence that was not before the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Mr Khan strongly argued that he  had  already  provided  the
    necessary evidence to meet the reasons for the refusal and was  waiting
    a long time for his parents to be able to visit him.   He did  not  see
    that he should now be required to produce more evidence.

12.  At the end of the hearing I reserved my  decision.  I   indicated  that
    having taken the views of both Mr  Duffy  and  Mr  Khan  that  I  would
    carefully consider how to proceed in the event that I found there to be
    an error of law in the  determination,  and  that  at  this  stage  all
    options were open.

Discussion and Decision

13.  I am satisfied that there was no material error of law in  the  judge's
    determination.  The Secretary of  State  raised  two  concerns  in  the
    Reasons for Refusal Letter, firstly evidence of  the  relationships  as
    between the sponsor (Mr Rao  Khan)  and  the  claimants  and  secondly,
    evidence of dependency by the claimants on the sponsor.  There were  no
    other issues raised in the reasons for refusal. Mr  Khan  attended  the
    hearing prepared to meet the concerns raised in the refusal notices and
    repeated in the Entry Clearance Manager's  review.   I  find  that  the
    Tribunal Judge proceeded to determine the appeal having regard to those
    two specific concerns.  There is  no  indication  in  the  reasons  for
    refusal or in the determination that the issue of whether  or  not  the
    EEA national was a qualified person was raised.  This is the issue that
    Mr Duffy now seeks to pursue.  He concedes  that  the  sponsor  as  the
    spouse of an EEA national who  himself  has  a  residence  card,  comes
    within the definition of a family member in accordance with Regulations
    7.  In effect Mr Duffy conceded that the reasons  given  in  the  entry
    clearance  review  were  wrong  and  in  contradiction  with  the   EEA
    Regulations.

14.  I am satisfied that throughout it has always  been  the  position  that
    the EEA national has been named as Mrs Maria  Ali  Khan  and  that  the
    claimants are related to her husband who himself is a family member  of
    an EEA national with a residence card.  As such the  Regulations  allow
    for applications to be made in these circumstances.   (Ihemedu(OFM's  -
    meaning) Nigeria 2011 UKUT 00340 (IAC)) In the event  that  there  were
    concerns as to whether or not the EEA national  was  exercising  treaty
    rights and was a qualified person, I find that this was a  matter  that
    requires to be specifically raised to enable the  claimant  to  address
    those concerns in grounds of appeal. I find that that it was not raised
    in this particular case.  I find no reference  to  this  issue  in  the
    Reasons for Refusal Letter. In the  Secretary  of  State's  grounds  of
    appeal it appears to be referred to in a somewhat roundabout way.

15.  Mr Duffy made no application to amend his  grounds  of  appeal.  It  is
    evident that Mr Duffy was aware of the  difficulties  in  pursuing  the
    appeal on the grounds concerning the definition of a family member  and
    I take the view that his case has been  argued  on  a  different  basis
    because the original grounds have no substance.

16.  I am  satisfied that the determination is  sound  and  that  the  judge
    reached a decision that was open to him on the evidence before him  and
    that he appropriately and correctly engaged with the issues  raised  by
    the Secretary of State and addressed by the  sponsor  at  the  hearing.
    The FTJ found the sponsor's evidence to be credible  and  accepted  the
    evidence of the employment and income of the EEA national [9] and found
    evidence that the claimants were dependent on the sponsor [9-11].  (Jia
    Migrationsverket case C-1/05 & Lu 15.2.07).

17.  I find no material error of law in the determination of the First  tier
    Tribunal, which shall stand.  The appeal is dismissed.  I  direct  that
    the Entry Clearance officer do issue an EEA family permit in accordance
    with Regulation 12.
