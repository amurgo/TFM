                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge L. Murray, promulgated on 21st January 2014, following a  hearing
    at Columbus House, Newport, on 8th January 2014.  In the determination,
    the judge allowed the appeal of AKM Borhan Uddin Khan,  to  the  extent
    that it remained outstanding before the Respondent Secretary of  State,
    because  the  latter  had  not  exercised  his  discretion  under   the
    "evidential flexibility" policy to make  enquiries  of  the  Appellant,
    such as to enable him to reach a proper decision  in  relation  to  the
    Appellant's application.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant's application  is  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  He made the application on 31st January  2013.
    The application fell to be determined under paragraph 245DD of HC  395.
    On 4th June 2013, the  Respondent  Secretary  of  State  rejected  that
    application  on  the  basis  that  the  information  required  by   the
    Immigration Rules had not been  provided.   The  Appellant,  who  is  a
    Bangladeshi national, born on 1st  July  1982,  appealed  against  that
    decision.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge heard evidence that the Appellant had access to  ï¿½50,000  and
    intended to invest the money in the UK.  He was the director  and  sole
    owner of his company.  There were  deficiencies  with  respect  to  the
    availability of a contract but "the contract was not a vital  document"
    (paragraph  8).   Furthermore,  "the  advertising  material  was   also
    available to the Appellant but he did not know it was required as  part
    of  his  application".   In  these  circumstances,  if  there  was  any
    deficiency  the  Respondent  Secretary  of  State   could   apply   the
    "evidential flexibility" policy and make enquiries.

 4. At the hearing, Mr Muquit, who represented the Appellant, stated in his
    skeleton argument, that  "the  evidence  which  was  missing  from  the
    application  was  the  marketing  material  which  was   now   present"
    (paragraph 11).  Therefore, it was being suggested that, "on  the  face
    of it there was sufficient evidence for the Respondent  to  investigate
    to see whether the company was advertising itself" (paragraph 12).

 5. The judge concluded that,

         "The  Appellant  did  not  submit  advertising  material  with  the
         application as required by paragraph 410SB(e)(iii)  and  I  do  not
         accept Mr Muquit's submission that by  providing  evidence  of  his
         company's registration at Companies House the  Appellant  satisfied
         the requirement by providing 'personal registration  with  a  trade
         body linked to the applicant's occupation'.  However I  agree  that
         the Respondent could have asked for  such  information"  (paragraph
         18).

    Given these findings, the judge held that, the failure of the judge  to
    make further enquiries, was not in accordance  with  the  law,  in  the
    light of the  "evidential  flexibility"  policy,  and  the  application
    remained outstanding before the Respondent (paragraph 20).  The  appeal
    was allowed to that extent.





Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application state that the judge erred by  allowing  the
    appeal under the policy of evidential  flexibility  because  the  plain
    fact was that the Appellant had not provided the  required  advertising
    material, which  was  a  requirement  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  and
    therefore  any  further  consideration  would  have  been  speculative.
    Moreover, there were insufficient reasons to believe that the documents
    actually existed.  The judge had not explained why the Respondent might
    have believed that the missing documents actually existed.

 7. On 2nd April 2014, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

 8. Appearing before me, Mr Hossain, of Counsel, represented the  Appellant
    on 6th May 2014.  He was double-booked  and  therefore  was  unable  to
    commence with this appeal until he had been released from court in  the
    other hearing.   This  was  not  an  ideal  way  in  which  to  provide
    representation before these Tribunals and I  indicated  to  Mr  Hossain
    that care should be taken to avoid this in the future.  Ms  A.  Everett
    who appeared for the Respondent Secretary of State, explained that  the
    core problem lay in the fact that the judge does  not  provide  reasons
    for concluding  that  the  current  director  appointment  report  from
    Companies House, was provided by the Appellant, in circumstances  where
    the Respondent stated that it had not (see paragraph 17).  This  report
    was not in  the  file.   It  was  still  not  there.   If  it  was  the
    Appellant's case that it had been provided, it was open to  Mr  Hossain
    to now explain where it was.  It simply was not there.

 9. For his part, Mr Hossain submitted that he would deal with the question
    of the advertising material.  He would do so by explaining  that  there
    was  no  provision  in  the  application  form  that  dealt  with   the
    advertising  material,  although  it  was  accepted  that  this  was  a
    requirement under the Immigration Rules, and the  fact  that  this  was
    prone to cause an injustice, was recognised by the fact that  the  form
    had since then been amended.

10. Given this, this was exactly the sort of situation where the evidential
    flexibility policy should have been applied by the Secretary of  State.
    It is true that the case of Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy) [2013]  UKUT
    00042, saw  the  Court  of  Appeal  restrict  the  application  of  the
    "eventual flexibility" policy, but this was much later, and it was  not
    a decision that applied  to  the  judge  when  he  made  his  decision.
    Ultimately the Secretary of State had to act fairly in  exercising  her
    discretion: see Ukus (discretion: when reviewable)  [2012]  UKUT  00307
    (IAC).

11. In reply, Ms Everett  submitted  that  the  plain  fact  was  that  the
    Appellant could not succeed under the Immigration Rules and  there  was
    no suggestion that paragraph 245AA did not apply.  The Court of  Appeal
    in Rodriguez did not say that paragraph 245 is not to  be  applied.   I
    should make a finding of an error of law and remake the decision.



Error of Law

12. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I  should  set  aside  that  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

13. First, the requirement of advertising  material  for  the  purposes  of
    marketing appears in the Immigration Rules at  paragraph  245.   It  is
    true that it was not specifically mentioned in the  form  at  the  time
    that the Appellant completed his form.  Nevertheless, the Rules require
    such information.  It was not provided.  The application was  therefore
    not made in accordance with the Immigration Rules.

14.  Second,  the  judge  heard  submissions  from  Mr  Muquit,  who   then
    represented the Appellant.  The judge only said that "Mr Muquit in  his
    skeleton argument... added that the evidence which was missing from the
    application  was  the  marketing  material  which  was   now   present"
    (paragraph 11).  However, it is not clear whether  this  statement  was
    ever made good in any way.  Certainly, it was not before this Tribunal.
     In any event, it did not comply with the Immigration Rules.

15. Third, the judge also concluded that the  Appellant  had  provided  the
    current  director  appointment  report  from  Companies   House.    The
    Respondent Secretary of State had argued that it was not provided.  The
    Appellant stated that he did provide this with his application and that
    the copy is attached to page 6 of his bundle.  It was still not  there.
    Ms Everett, appearing  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant,  stated  in  her
    submissions before me today, that there may well be an explanation,  if
    this documentation had been provided but was not there, which could  be
    put before this Tribunal.  If so this could be done.   Mr  Hossain  did
    not provide any such explanation.  Therefore, the position remains  the
    same, namely, that at paragraph 17, in concluding that such information
    had been provided, the judge failed to give reasons.  He failed to  say
    that he had himself seen this information at page 6 of the bundle.

16. Finally, the judge relied upon the "evidential flexibility"  policy  to
    state,  in  these  circumstances,   that   the   application   remained
    outstanding.  In short, this amounted to an error of law.

Remaking the Decision

17. I have remade the decision on the basis  of  the  findings  before  the
    original judge, the evidence before him, and  the  submissions  that  I
    have heard today.  I  am  dismissing  this  appeal  for  the  following
    reasons.

18. First,  the  requirement  under  the  Immigration  Rules  was  for  the
    marketing  material  to  be  provided.   It  was  not  provided.    The
    application was therefore not in accordance with the Rules.

19. Second, the evidential flexibility policy does not extend to the extent
    of requiring the Secretary of State to make enquiries about outstanding
    material,  such  as  the  marketing  material,  which  is   clearly   a
    requirement of the Rules.

20. Third, there is no evidence that this material was presented before the
    original judge (as submitted in the skeleton argument of Mr Muquit: see
    paragraph 11).   For  all  these  reasons,  this  appeal  falls  to  be
    dismissed.




Decision

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    dismissed.

22. No anonymity order is made.
