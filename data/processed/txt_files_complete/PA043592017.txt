Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr A Burnett, instructed by JD Spicer Zeb Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269), I make an anonymity  direction.  Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings
    or any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly
    identify the appellant.

 2. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Frankish  promulgated  12.7.18,  dismissing  his  appeal
    against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State,  dated  21.4.17,  to
    refuse his protection claim.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Andrew  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    13.8.18. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul granted permission to appeal  on
    7.2.19.

 4. The error of law consideration came before Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins
    on 8.3.19. His decision promulgated 11.3.19 accepted the concession  of
    the respondent  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    defective for absence of findings on the appellant's ability to  obtain
    a CSID, necessary to his safe return. Further, the First-tier  Tribunal
    failed to determine if the appellant's home is safe.

 5. Judge Perkins found errors of law, set the decision aside, and reserved
    the remaking of the decision in the appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.  He
    also held that the findings of the First-tier Tribunal,  including  the
    adverse credibility findings, stand "unless  necessarily  displaced  by
    findings on the availability of the CSID and the  safety  of  the  home
    area."

 6. The resumed appeal hearing was allocated to me pursuant to  a  transfer
    order made by the Principal Resident Judge on 8.4.19.

 7. The preserved findings including the following:

      a) That the appellant is not a credible witness in his own cause [15];

      b) The  core  factual  account  was  found  to  be  untrue  [22].  The
         contradictions to the appellant's core account were found to be  so
         deep, central and pervasive that they are  not  true.  The  claimed
         murder of the appellant's brother and the threats of murder to  the
         appellant and his father, and the  alleged  circumstances  thereof,
         were entirely rejected, although it may  be  that  the  brother  is
         deceased and there may have been  some  "fractious  disputes"  over
         grazing land;

      c) Khalid's family were not all-powerful as claimed and the  assertion
         that they were endowed with  power  through  KDPI  connections  was
         rejected;

      d) The family  sold  assets  to  finance  the  transportation  of  the
         appellant to Northern Europe as an economic migrant [24].  However,
         he abandoned the endeavour following a failed claim in  Switzerland
         and returned home, only to  be  sent  back  again  by  his  family.
         Nothing new has transpired at home since that claim;

      e) The appellant was fingerprinted in Bulgaria  but  failed  to  claim
         asylum there, which undermined his credibility pursuant to s8;

      f) "The appellant accepted that his representatives in Switzerland had
         his identity document but  he  left  before  waiting  for  them  to
         retrieve it and pass it to him [25];"

      g) With his family connections in Iraq and the proceeds of the sale of
         assets held for him by his brother-in-law, there is  no  risk  that
         the appellant will be destitute on return to  Iraq.  He  will  also
         have ï¿½1,500 available to him from  the  assisted  voluntary  return
         scheme;

      h) The claim that the appellant's lost his parents in  a  forest,  the
         suggestion that they may be deceased, or alternatively  that  their
         whereabouts unknown to him was rejected as not credible [23];

      i) In any event, the appellant has other family in Iraq, including his
         sister and brother-in-law, as  well  as  a  paternal  uncle  living
         locally to his family.

 8. At the hearing before me, in his oral evidence  the  appellant  adopted
    his previous  and  new  witness  statement  of  22.3.19,  in  which  he
    maintains he remains unaware of the whereabouts of his parents and that
    he is not in contact with his sister in Iraq or his paternal uncle,  or
    any other family member in Iraq. He points to belated attempts to  make
    contact with his family through the Red Cross and I have been  provided
    with a single letter from the Red Cross,  dated  3.1.19,  confirming  a
    very recent tracing enquiry. The letter states that  updates  would  be
    provided every three months, but no further communication from the  Red
    Cross has been produced, the absence of which is not explained. He  was
    then cross-examined by Mr Jarvis.

 9. A full note of the  oral  evidence  and  the  submissions  of  the  two
    representatives is with the  tribunal's  case  file  and  need  not  be
    recited here. However, I point out that the appellant was  specifically
    challenged as to the whereabouts of his identity documents.  He  denied
    the account recorded at [25] of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    that his representatives in Switzerland had his identity  document  but
    he left before waiting for them to retrieve it  and  pass  it  to  him.
    Before me, he claimed that he had one ID card which was taken from  him
    by the police at the point of arrest in Switzerland. He thought it  had
    been taken to the court but was not given back to him. He said he asked
    his representatives for it and they told him they could not get it back
    for him. He was unable to wait any longer as he had been given  a  date
    by which he had to leave the country. This account is inconsistent with
    that recorded in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  no
    evidence other than the word of  the  appellant  has  been  adduced  to
    demonstrate that the judge had inaccurately recorded the  evidence.  If
    that had been the case  some  substantive  evidence  should  have  been
    provided of the alleged inaccuracy. Mr Burnett suggested that what  the
    appellant was recorded  as  saying  was  consistent  with  his  present
    account. I do not accept that at all; it is plain that the account  now
    given was not put before the First-tier Tribunal. In the circumstances,
    to the extent that his present account differs from that as recorded in
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal I cannot accept it as truthful.
    I must proceed on the basis that the appellant did  have  an  Iraqi  ID
    document which was held, or at the very least accessible to  his  legal
    representatives in Switzerland. He left the country without waiting for
    it to be retrieved and returned to him. It follows  that  the  document
    must still be available and yet no effort has been made to seek it.

10. In the light of the preserved findings and  the  inconsistency  between
    those and his new  and  existing  statements,  as  well  as  the  clear
    rejection of the appellant's credibility and his core factual  account,
    I also find that I cannot accept the appellant's renewed claim in  oral
    evidence to have no contact with his family in Iraq. It follows that  I
    must proceed on the basis that not only will he be able to make contact
    with family  members  in  Iraq  but  benefit  from  their  support  and
    financial assistance, entirely consistent  with  the  findings  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

11. Applying the amended country guidance from AA (Iraq) v SSHD [2017] EWCA
    Civ 944 and AAH (Iraqi Kurds - internal relocation) Iraq CG [2018] UKUT
    00212 (IAC), it is necessary to consider whether the appellant will  be
    able to obtain a CSID before or shortly after  returning  to  Iraq,  to
    assess the risk on return in his home area, and  determine  whether  he
    will be able to return to the home area, or alternatively  relocate  to
    Baghdad or the IKR.

Return to the Home Area or Relocation Elsewhere?

12. It was not made very clear in the First-tier Tribunal decision, but  it
    is common ground that the appellant originates from Alawa Mahmoud [24],
    which it is agreed lies outside the IKR, in the vicinity of Kirkuk. The
    question arises whether he can return to his  home  area.  The  amended
    Country Guidance  of  AA  is  to  the  effect  that  Kirkuk  remains  a
    'contested area' with a risk of article 15(c) indiscriminate  violence.
    Mr  Jarvis  urged  on  me  that  there  has  been  such  a  change   of
    circumstances since the demise of  ISIS  that  the  home  area  can  be
    regarded as safe and that I should depart from the Country Guidance. He
    referred me to the most recent CPIN of November 2018 and in  particular
    paragraphs 2.3.20 to 2.3.36, as well as the  charts  at  section  8.  I
    accept that there is evidence demonstrating a reduction in incidents of
    violence. However, I am not satisfied that pursuant to SG (Iraq) v SSHD
    [2012] EWCA Civ 940, that the evidence relied on amounts to very strong
    grounds supported by cogent evidence  to  justify  departing  from  the
    Country  Guidance.  In  the  circumstances,  I  find  that  it  is  not
    reasonable to expect the appellant to return to his home area.

13. Neither am I satisfied on the application of the Country Guidance  that
    the appellant as a Sunni Kurd with no known family  support  there  can
    safely relocate to Baghdad. Mr Jarvis made the point that  it  was  for
    the appellant to demonstrate  that  it  would  be  unreasonable  and/or
    unduly harsh to  expect  him  to  relocate  to  Baghdad.  However,  the
    appellant would have no network of  support  there  and  would  on  two
    grounds be a member of a minority ethnic or religious grouping with  no
    evidence that he speaks Arabic or has any means  to  establish  himself
    there.

14. In the circumstances, I have turn to consider relocation  to  the  IKR,
    applying the amended  Country  Guidance.  As  the  appellant  does  not
    emanate from the IKR he cannot be returned there directly but will have
    to make his own way there from Baghdad. However, the appellant would be
    no more than a transit passenger at Baghdad Airport. Whilst AAH  stated
    that flights to the IKR, to Erbil and Sulaymaniyah had been  suspended,
    that is no longer the case and there are direct flights from Baghdad on
    a daily basis. I understand that  the  Home  Office  will  not  enforce
    return  beyond  Baghdad  but  that  a  through  ticket  for  Erbil   or
    Sulaymaniyah will be  provided  on  request.  There  are  international
    flights to IKR airports from a number of countries,  including  Austria
    and Jordan but as the appellant cannot be returned directly to the IKR,
    these are not available to him. However, to be able to board  a  flight
    to the IKR from Baghdad Airport, the Country  Guidance  indicates  that
    the appellant will need a CSID.

The CSID

15. From the Country Guidance in both AA and AAH, I accept that whether  or
    not return is presently feasible, it is necessary to  consider  whether
    the appellant will have access to a CSID before or shortly after return
    to Iraq, within a reasonable time frame. Amongst the  relevant  factors
    in that consideration held in AAH is  whether  the  appellant  has  any
    other form of documentation available  to  him,  or  other  information
    about the  location  of  his  entry  in  the  civil  register.  I  have
    considered the factors set out in AAH including  the  location  of  the
    civil registry office and whether there are family  members  who  could
    attend  the  office  to  obtain  the  necessary  information.   Country
    background information also suggests that there are a number  of  other
    ways to obtain a CSID, including whilst still in the  UK  provided  the
    appellant has the information of the book volume and page number of his
    family entry in the register.

16. On the evidence and the preserved findings I find  that  the  appellant
    either has access to his CSID or will  be  able  to  access  sufficient
    information to obtain a renewal of the  CSID  before  leaving  the  UK.
    First, as stated above, there is no evidence that either the  appellant
    or his present legal representatives have made any contact  with  those
    legal representatives  to  seek  the  Iraqi  ID  document  he  left  in
    Switzerland. It follows that this is one source of identification  that
    will enable the appellant to retrieve that ID document and  use  it  to
    obtain a CSID to enable his return to  Iraq.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    noted this was one means to overcome the documentation problem.

17. Second, I have rejected the appellant's claim to have lost contact with
    his family in Iraq. It follows that he has  family  members,  including
    male relatives, who can act on his behalf either as a family member  or
    as a proxy to obtain the relevant information  necessary  to  obtain  a
    CSID. The  finding  has  been  preserved  that  the  family  also  hold
    financial resources, certainly more than enough to  twice  finance  his
    journey as an economic migrant to  Europe.  With  such  resources,  the
    appellant can also employ a lawyer or other representative acting  with
    a power of attorney to  obtain  the  relevant  details  or  indeed  the
    renewed document.  I also note that  there  is  no  evidence  that  the
    appellant has made any attempt to renew his CSID  via  the  embassy  or
    consulate in the UK. It follows that I am satisfied that the  appellant
    will have access to a CSID before returning to Iraq and  thus  will  be
    able to board a flight to the IKR. The Country Guidance is  that  as  a
    Kurd he will not be denied entry and will not be required to leave.

18. Whilst the appellant cannot himself be expected to go  to  Kirkuk,  his
    home area is a relatively short distance from the IKR. I  am  satisfied
    that he is in contact with family members and has not lost  contact  as
    claimed. He will be able to make contact and renew his family ties from
    within the IKR. It would not be unreasonable  to  expect  those  family
    members to also contact the appellant in the IKR and visit  him  there.
    With the assisted voluntary return funds and the financial resources of
    his family he will be able to provide  accommodation  for  himself  and
    give himself time to establish himself in the IKR. He will not face any
    risk of indiscriminate violence there and  being  able  to  demonstrate
    that he has come from the UK, he will not be suspected of ISIS sympathy
    or of having come directly from ISIS territory. There is no known  ISIS
    link in his family background and there is no evidence that he will  be
    regarded with suspicion.

19. On the evidence taken as a whole, I am  satisfied  that  the  appellant
    will not need to access a critical shelter arrangement and  given  that
    he is able-bodied he will be able to seek  work  in  the  same  way  as
    others. I have found he will also have or be  able  to  obtain  a  CSID
    relatively quickly so that he will be able to access both accommodation
    and legitimate employment, as  well  as  government  support  services.
    Whilst there may be challenges, his position with  family  support  and
    financial resources will be rather  better  than  many  others.  He  is
    physically fit and would want to work. In all the circumstances, I find
    that he will be able to establish himself and lead a relatively  normal
    life in the IKR without facing a  risk  of  destitution  or  living  in
    inhuman conditions  such  as  to  breach  article  3  ECHR.  It  would,
    therefore, not be unduly harsh to expect the  appellant  to  return  to
    Iraq via Baghdad and relocate to the IKR.

20. It follows from the above and for the reasons set out that  the  appeal
    cannot succeed on  asylum,  humanitarian  protection  grounds,  or  the
    narrow ambit of articles 2 and 3 ECHR grounds.

Decision

21. It was previously found that the making of the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on a point of  law
    such that the decision should be set aside. The decision was set aside.
    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on all grounds.
