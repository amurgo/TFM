                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent
Representation

For the appellant:         Mr E Fripp, Counsel instructed by Sutovic &
Hartigan
                       Solicitors.

For the respondent:        Mr J Parkinson, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer



                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS
   1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 7 January 1977.   She
      entered the United Kingdom on 9 April 2010 with entry clearance  as  a
      potential organ donor valid to 25 September  2010.   On  15  September
      2010  the  appellant  applied  for  further  leave  to  remain.    Her
      application was rejected on 25 October 2010 and the appellant did  not
      challenge that rejection.

   2. On  6  December  2010,  the  appellant  claimed  asylum,  humanitarian
      protection and leave to remain on  human  rights  grounds  (Article  8
      ECHR) based on threats made to  her  in  the  United  Kingdom.  On  17
      December 2010, the respondent refused to grant leave to remain on  any
      of those grounds.

   3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.   Her  appeal  was
      dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Tiffen.  The appellant appealed
      to the Upper Tribunal which on 21 March 2011 found a material error of
      law and adjourned the appeal for the decision to  be  remade,  in  the
      Upper Tribunal. It was then considered possible that the appeal  might
      be suitable for a country guidance decision, but in the light  of  the
      anonymity order which has been made, the appeal is not  being  treated
      as  country  guidance  and  it  is  now  time  for  it  to  be   heard
      substantively.

   4. It is now over 5 years since the last time  that  the  facts  in  this
      appeal were assessed.  Since the appeal  is  no  longer  suitable  for
      potential country guidance, there is no good reason to  retain  it  in
      the Upper Tribunal for fact-finding and for the  substantive  remaking
      of the decision.

   5. The respondent's file has been lost.  The Upper Tribunal has  provided
      such  copy  documents  as  it  can  to  assist  the  respondent.   The
      directions below make provision for copy documents to be  provided  by
      the appellant to assist the respondent, and the basis  on  which  they
      are to be provided.

DIRECTIONS

   6. I make the  following  directions  for  the  future  conduct  of  this
      hearing:


              1) This appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.  It  is
                 listed for substantive hearing at Taylor House  on  5  July
                 2016 with a time estimate of 1 day.

              2) The anonymity order is maintained.


              3) The appellant's Grounds of Appeal (unless  further  amended
                 or varied  on application to the First-tier Tribunal) shall
                 be as set out in her Amended Grounds of Appeal/ Schedule of
                 Heads of Claim dated 16 January 2015;


              4) The findings at paragraphs 20, 21, and 23 of the First-tier
                 Tribunal decision are preserved, with the exception of  the
                 final sentence of paragraph 23, subject as  always  to  the
                 displacement of those findings  in  the  light  of  further
                 evidence and/or other changes which the First-tier Tribunal
                 considers to be relevant to the continued validity of  such
                 findings;


              5) By consent, and following  the  loss  of  the  respondent's
                 file, it is agreed that:

                 a) The appellant by his  representatives  Messrs.  Sutovic
                    and Hartigan shall provide to the respondent a copy  of
                    all documents which the  appellant  obtained  from  the
                    respondent by Subject Access Request and  all  and  any
                    documents previously served by  the  appellant  on  the
                    respondent in support of her appeal.

                 b) Such documents shall include copies of any relevant  CD
                    or CDs on which reliance is to be placed.

                 c) The respondent will reimburse Sutovic and  Hartigan  at
                    the rate of 5p per copy page to a maximum of  ï¿½200  for
                    such copy documents.


              6) The parties shall if possible agree, serve and file a joint
                 bundle before the substantive  hearing  in  the  First-tier
                 Tribunal.

              7) If no joint bundle is agreed,  and  subject  to  any  order
                 which  may  be  made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  as  to
                 evidence, the parties shall file and serve  their  evidence
                 for the substantive  hearing,  addressing  all  significant
                 issues to be  considered  at  such  hearing  and  including
                 witness statements for  any  witness  upon  whose  evidence
                 either party will rely at the hearing, as follows:


                 a) Not later than 21 days before the substantive hearing of
                    this appeal in the First-tier  Tribunal,  the  appellant
                    shall file and serve all evidence upon which he  intends
                    to rely at the hearing;

                 b) Not later than 14 days before the substantive hearing of
                    this appeal in the First-tier Tribunal,  the  respondent
                    shall file and serve all evidence upon which she intends
                    to rely at the hearing.

              8) The First-tier Tribunal may decide to fix a case management
                 review; in default, it remains  open  to  either  party  to
                 apply for a case management review to  be  fixed,  in  good
                 time before the substantive hearing.

              9) Liberty  to  either  party  to  apply  to  vary  the  above
                 directions, on written notice to the other  party  and  the
                 Tribunal.
