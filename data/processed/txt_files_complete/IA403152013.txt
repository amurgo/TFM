Representation:

For the appellant:     Not represented
For the respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Luisa Ximena Lira Jimenez, date of birth 14.2.81,  is  a
    citizen of Mexico.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Dickson promulgated 2.10.14, dismissing her  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent, dated 3.10.13, to  refuse  her  application
    made on 1.2.13 for a permanent residence  card  as  confirmation  of  a
    permanent right to reside in the UK, pursuant to the Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.  The Judge heard the appeal on 22.9.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Macdonald granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    18.11.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 6.1.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Dickson should be set aside.

 6. The grounds of application for permission to appeal  contend  that  the
    judge made a material error by considering that  the  phrase  "residing
    with" meant that the appellant had  to  be  living  together  with  her
    husband, from whom she was separated in 2010.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Macdonald noted that the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge found that the appellant and her EEA spouse had not
    lived together for a continuous period of 5 years, which  approach  was
    an arguable error of law.

 8. Mr Duffy conceded that the judge was in error. As held in the  case  of
    PM (EEA - spouse - "residing with") Turkey [2011] UKUT 89 (IAC) and the
    European case of Diatta v Land Berlin, resided with means in  the  same
    EEA state  whilst  the  marriage  is  continuing.  She  can  acquire  a
    permanent right of residence under regulation 15(1)(b) if  her  husband
    keeps on working in the UK during the requisite period of  five  years,
    without having to reside with him. But if her husband stops working, or
    she cannot prove that he has been exercising Treaty  rights,  her  five
    years' residence will not lead to a permanent right of residence,  even
    if she has herself been working.

 9. It follows that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  cannot  stand
    and must be set aside and remade. The application was refused primarily
    because the Secretary of State was not satisfied that  the  EEA  spouse
    was economically active in the five year period between the marriage in
    2008 and when he left for Israel in 2013. That issue was  preserved  in
    the Rule 24 response, relying on rule 24(3)(e), even though the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge found at ï¿½19 that the EEA spouse, Mr  Soussan,  had
    exercised Treaty rights as a  self-employed  worker  for  more  than  5
    years.

10. However, Mr Duffy conceded that the Rule 24 response had  been  drafted
    without sight of the appellant's 300-page bundle and only on the  basis
    of the documents submitted with the application. We therefore took some
    time during the hearing to look through some of  the  bundle  with  the
    assistance of the appellant. I was able to see  and  point  out  to  Mr
    Duffy that there are letters from the accountant enclosing  HMRC  self-
    assessment calculations including a profit and loss statement for  each
    of the relevant tax years for Mr  Soussan.  In  the  circumstances,  Mr
    Duffy did not resist the appeal against the original refusal  decision.



11. It follows that I find that the appellant meets the requirements of the
    Regulations for the permanent residence card she sought and the  appeal
    should be allowed.





Conclusion & Decision:

12. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside and remade.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by  allowing  it
                    under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a whole fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been allowed.
