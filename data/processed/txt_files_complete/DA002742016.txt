For the Respondent:    In person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State I shall  refer  to
    the parties as in the First-tier Tribunal. The Appellant  is  a  Polish
    national who was born on 25th November 1982.  His  appeal  against  the
    Respondent's  decision  to  deport  him  under  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006 was allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge B Lloyd in  a
    decision dated 19th August 2016.
2.   The Respondent appealed on the grounds that given  the  seriousness  of
    the index offence, which was reflected in the severity of the sentence,
    the  judge's  conclusion  that  the  personal  conduct  of  the  person
    concerned did not represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
    threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of  society  amounted
    to an error of law.

3.    The  judge  found  that   the   Appellant's   deportation   would   be
    disproportionate, but because of the  seriousness  of  the  offence  it
    would only be in very extreme cases that this  would  in  fact  be  the
    case. The judge had not adequately explained, given the seriousness  of
    the conviction in Poland, why the Appellant  did  not  meet  Regulation
    21(5)(c).

4.   Permission to appeal was granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  M  J
    Gillespie on the grounds that the reason given for the finding that the
    Appellant was not a genuine, present and  sufficiently  serious  threat
    was effectively the view of the judge that the Appellant must  rue  the
    day on which he committed his trigger offence in the UK and came "three
    millimetres away from the ruination of his life  in  the  UK".  It  was
    fairly arguable that the reasons are subjective in appearance  and  not
    adequate given the apparent seriousness of the  offence  of  which  the
    Appellant was convicted.

5.    The  Appellant  was  convicted  of  attempted  murder  and  destroying
    documents in Poland in 2000 [the index offence]. He was sentenced to 13
    years' imprisonment. He served his sentence in Poland. He came  to  the
    UK in December 2011. On 23rd February 2016, he was convicted of failing
    to provide a specimen, driving otherwise in accordance with a  licence,
    using a vehicle while uninsured and possessing a prohibited weapon [the
    trigger offence]. He was sentenced to a community  order,  disqualified
    from driving and ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work.


Submissions

6.   Mr Clarke submitted that there was one substantive  ground,  namely  an
    inadequacy of reasoning.  The  Appellant  had  been  convicted  of  two
    offences, attempted murder in Poland for which he had received thirteen
    years' imprisonment and offences in the UK in February  2016  of  drink
    driving, driving without a licence or insurance and having an offensive
    weapon.

7.   The judge found that the decision to deport was not  proportionate  and
    that the Appellant was not a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious
    threat.  Although  there  may  be  a  low  risk  of   reoffending   the
    consequences  of  harm  were  so  serious  that  it   would   make   it
    proportionate. The Appellant did not have five  years'  residence.  The
    judge's finding that he was in the wrong place at the  wrong  time  was
    perverse.  Given  the  offences  of  attempted  murder  which  required
    intention,  and  driving  a  car  whilst  drunk,  both  of  which  were
    deliberate acts, it could not be said that the  Appellant  was  in  the
    wrong place at the wrong time.

8.   The judge failed to engage with the  seriousness  of  the  offence  and
    what would be the consequences of further offending. The Appellant  had
    acted in a way which fortunately had not caused loss of  life,  but  he
    had acted in a way to be a danger to  public  safety.  There  would  be
    catastrophic  consequences  for  the  public  if  he  reoffended.   The
    threshold was a low one. The acts of the Appellant were  not  accidents
    but deliberate.

9.   At paragraph 46, the judge did not recognise  that  the  Appellant  was
    found guilty of  attempted  murder  and  evidence  from  the  Appellant
    seeking to diminish his  actions  was  inconsistent  with  the  serious
    nature of the offence. It was impossible to see  how  the  judge  could
    make such a finding that the Appellant was in the wrong  place  at  the
    wrong time and accordingly his findings were perverse.

10.  Mr Sidor submitted that his friend had asked him to drive  the  car  in
    relation to the offence in the UK and he did him a favour. He regretted
    harming his family in this way.  The situation was difficult in  Poland
    and he had spent ten years in prison. It was difficult to start  a  new
    life for seven years after leaving prison.  There  had  only  been  one
    offence connected with the car and he regretted  it  so  much  that  he
    would stay  away  from  any  problems  connected  with  the  law.  Most
    important were his family and his children. The  last  six  months  had
    been very difficult and  stressful  both  physically,  emotionally  and
    financially.  He was just waiting for a time to return to work  because
    he was responsible for his family and children and would like to return
    to a normal life.


Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

11.  The judge took into account the  evidence  of  the  Appellant  and  the
    evidence of the Appellant's partner and he set  out  that  evidence  at
    paragraphs 42 to 52 of his decision. The  Appellant  was  convicted  of
    attempted murder in 2000 and was sentenced to 13  years'  imprisonment.
    The judge found that shortly after he completed that sentence  he  came
    to the UK looking for work and a new life. The  Appellant  appeared  to
    have followed the "straight and narrow" while in the UK until a  stupid
    and thoughtless decision early in 2016 led to a conviction for  driving
    under the influence  of  alcohol  and  without  a  driving  licence  or
    insurance. To compound matters he was found to be in  possession  of  a
    pepper spray, the only purpose of which could have  been  an  offensive
    weapon.

12.  The judge found that the Appellant's removal would be  disproportionate
    and he was not satisfied that  the  Appellant  represented  a  genuine,
    present and sufficiently serious threat to the public if he remained in
    the UK.  He made the following findings:

         "58. I am satisfied  having  listened  to  the  Appellant  and  his
         partner that he must  rue  the  day  that  he  was  so  stupid  and
         irresponsible as to drive his friend home. Whilst  not  only  under
         the influence of alcohol but also without a licence  or  insurance.
         Moreover to compound matters  he  was  accustomed  to  carrying  an
         offensive weapon whilst albeit legal in Poland  was  certainly  not
         lawful in the UK.


         59.  However, I do not by any means conclude that this Appellant is
         a bad man intrinsically.  He has on two occasions in his life - and
         more especially in 2000 - been caught upon events which put him  in
         the wrong place at the wrong time.  That is not to condone his lack
         of responsibility or  massive  ill-judgment.   However,  I  do  not
         believe that the circumstances before me bring  me,  fairly,  to  a
         conclusion that he is a genuine, present and  sufficiently  serious
         threat to those around him in the UK.


         60.  I believe that this Appellant has  truly  learned  his  lesson
         because he  has  come  to  but  three  millimetres  away  from  the
         ruination of his life in the UK and his return to his home  country
         which he had decided to abandon for a new life in the UK."



Discussion and conclusion

13.  Mr Clarke submitted that the judge's finding that the Appellant was  in
    the wrong place at the wrong time was a perverse finding for  which  he
    gave no reason because it could  not  be  said  that  the  offences  he
    committed were done by  accident  given  that  they  both  amounted  to
    deliberate acts on the part of the Appellant.

14.  I am not persuaded by this submission because it is clear from  reading
    paragraph 59 that the judge  was  not  suggesting  that  the  Appellant
    committed the offences by accident. The judge stated that he did not to
    condone the Appellant's lack of responsibility or massive ill-judgment.
    The judge was well  aware  that  the  actions  of  the  Appellant  were
    deliberate. The phrase "wrong place at the wrong time" referred to  the
    Appellant's explanation. It was not a perverse  finding  for  which  no
    reasons were given. Nor was it material to the judge's  acknowledgement
    of  the  seriousness  of   the   offences   and   his   assessment   of
    proportionality.

15.   There  were  no  credibility  issues  and  the  judge   accepted   the
    Appellant's account. When the Appellant committed the offence in Poland
    he was only 17 years old; he was na�ve and lacking  in  confidence.  He
    had been out with some young female friends of  his.  They  were  being
    harassed and intimidated by an older man who was seeking  to  ply  them
    with alcohol for sexual purposes. He and a friend of  his  had  ushered
    the girls away and he and a friend had tried to warn the  man  off  and
    admonish him for his bad behaviour. The man had become  violent  and  a
    fracas  ensued  in  which  the  man  had  become   seriously   injured.
    Unfortunately his friend  had  compounded  the  matter  by  seeking  to
    destroy the man's Polish identity card. The Appellant  had  shared  the
    blame for that also.


16.  The judge found at paragraph  47:  "The  Appellant  fully  acknowledged
    that offences for which he had  been  convicted  in  Poland  were  very
    serious indeed. He regretted that episode in Poland  bitterly;  but  he
    had received a very harsh punishment indeed.    He  had  served  almost
    thirteen years in prison.  It had ruined his life  in  Poland  and  had
    given him an indelible stain on his character. It was a matter which he
    now bitterly regretted. He had resolved  that  he  would  lead  a  more
    responsible life.  He  could  not  deny  that  he  had  lapsed  in  his
    responsibility early in 2016 when he stupidly tried to help his  friend
    by driving him home."

17.  It is clear from paragraphs 58 to 60 that  the  judge  finds  that  the
    Appellant acknowledges the serious nature of the offences  and  regrets
    his actions such that he has put himself in a situation where  he  will
    not reoffend in the future.  The judge was entitled to rely on the oral
    evidence of the Appellant and his wife in finding  that  the  Appellant
    did not represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to
    the public. This finding was open to the judge and therefore looking at
    the evidence of the Appellant's circumstances as a  whole  his  removal
    would not be proportionate  under  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
    2006.

18.  I find that the judge gave adequate reasons  for  his  conclusions  and
    those conclusions were open to him on the  evidence  before  him.   His
    decision was not perverse and he did not fail to take into account  all
    relevant factors in assessing whether  the  Appellant  was  a  genuine,
    present and sufficiently  serious  threat.  The  index  offence  was  a
    serious one, but had taken place when the Appellant was only  17  years
    old and he had served a very severe punishment. The trigger offence was
    such that the  Appellant  had  learned  his  lesson  and  the  risk  of
    reoffending was low.

19.  Accordingly, I find that there was no  error  of  law  in  the  judge's
    decision dated 19th August 2016 and the Secretary of State's appeal  is
    dismissed.
