For the Appellant:     Mrs Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Ashraf, Blakewater Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Pakistan  date  of  birth  1st  January
    1991. On the 14th June 2016 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge AK  Simpson)
    allowed her appeal against a decision to  refuse  to  grant  her  entry
    clearance with a view to settlement as a 'partner' under Appendix FM of
    the Immigration Rules. The Entry Clearance Officer now  has  permission
    to appeal against that decision.


 2. The only matter in issue before the Tribunal was  whether  Mrs  Sajid's
    husband  in the United Kingdom, Sajid Hussain,  had demonstrated,  with
    reference to the 'specified evidence' listed in Appendix FM-SE  of  the
    rules, that he earned in  excess  of  �18,600  per  year,  the  minimum
    household income set out in E-LTRP.3.1.

 3. The evidence on application was that Mr Hussain had two jobs. He stated
    that he had been employed by Khanjra & Co since October 2005  and  that
    he earned �11,197.08 per year there. He also worked for  Accrol  Papers
    and in that job earned �16,749.64.  In respect of both  employments  he
    had to produce, for the six months prior to the application being  made
    (March - September 2013) the following documents:

          . Every wage slip
          . Bank statements showing salary deposited
          . Letter from the employer confirming the terms of his  employment
            and salary

 4. It did not appear to be in  issue  that  Mr  Hussain  was  employed  as
    claimed during the relevant period, or that he earned  well  above  the
    minimum income threshold.   Nor does it appear to be in issue  that  he
    continued to do so at the date of the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, nor that he does so today. The problem identified by the  ECO
    was that he had not provided all of the specified evidence, namely  all
    of the consecutive payslips accompanied by  all  of  the  corresponding
    bank statements.


 5. In its determination the Tribunal notes that there does appear to  have
    been some confusion caused by the fact that during the relevant  period
    Mr Hussain had opened a new bank account.  He had given evidence to the
    effect that when the ECO prepared his bundles  some  of  the  documents
    that had been  submitted  by  Mrs  Sajid  were  missing.  There  is  an
    admission to that effect by Entry Clearance Manager in his review dated
    1st September 2014. Of this the Tribunal notes:

         "It is common ground that only 25 payslips from Accrol Papers  were
         included in the Respondent's bundle, albeit it is asserted that  26
         were  provided.  Given  that  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  (ECM)
         acknowledges that some of the original documentation could  not  be
         found and photocopies had to be relied on, it is possible that  the
         26th wage slip has gone the same way as the missing  original  bank
         statements! Be that as it may, it is also quite clear that the  ECM
         does  not  appear  to  have  examined  the   Santander   statements
         submitted, as these clearly  show  the  apparently  missing  Accrol
         Papers salary payments. Given that these statements  are  contained
         within the Respondent's bundle it cannot be said that they were not
         available prior to the ECM's review, in which case  they  ought  to
         have been taken into account.

 6. The Tribunal goes on to direct itself to the guidance in  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department v SS (Congo) and Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387,
    in particular that: "if an applicant can show that there are individual
    interests at stake covered by Article 8 which give  rise  to  a  strong
    claim that compelling circumstances may exist to justify the  grant  of
    LTE outside the Rules, the fact that their case is also a  'near  miss'
    case may be a relevant  consideration  which  tips  the  balance  under
    Article 8 in  their  favour".    The  determination  concludes  by  the
    Tribunal identifying what that "strong claim" is in this case: this  is
    a genuine marriage, the financial requirements are met, the couple have
    not acted in a way that undermines immigration control, the sponsor  is
    a British citizen in full time employment, there  has  already  been  a
    lengthy delay and the "benefit of the doubt" in respect of  the  single
    missing payslip should be given to Mrs Sajid,  particularly  given  the
    ECOs acknowledgement that some of the  material  has  gone  missing  at
    Post.  The appeal was allowed with reference to Mrs Sajid's  Article  8
    rights.


 7. The ECO now appeals on the following grounds:


              i) There has been a failure to apply the guidance in Secretary
                 of State for the Home Department v SS (Congo) & Ors  [2015]
                 EWCA Civ 387


             ii) The Tribunal appears  to  have  impermissibly  allowed  the
                 appeal on the grounds that there had been a 'near miss'  of
                 the Rules




    My Findings


 8. The first question raised  in  this  appeal  is  whether  the  Tribunal
    properly directed itself as to the current  state  of  the  law  as  it
    relates to Article 8, and Appendices FM and FM-SE  in  particular.   It
    appears to me quite plain that it did. Specific reference is made to SS
    (Congo) and the need for the appellant to demonstrate  a  strong  claim
    that compelling circumstances exist.

 9. The next question  is  whether  that  guidance  was  properly  applied.
    Before me Mrs Aboni pointed out that there are many genuine couples who
    fall foul of the strict evidential requirements now  contained  in  the
    Rules, albeit that they do in fact earn over the required amount.  That
    this is so, and that this will not of  itself   constitute  'compelling
    circumstances' is expressly recognised in SS (Congo).  What  took  this
    case above the generality of cases, in the view of Judge Simpson,  were
    two factors.

10. First, this was a case which failed under  the  Rules  for  want  of  a
    single payslip. That this  was  a  'near  miss'  was  not  however  the
    relevant issue. The point was rather that it appeared entirely possible
    that the 'missing' payslip had in fact been supplied, but had for  some
    reasons been lost at the entry clearance  post  along  with  the  other
    documents referred to by the ECM.  Judge Simpson was not in a  position
    to make a definitive finding one way or the other, but she  noted  that
    possibility, the apparently credible evidence of the Sponsor,  and  the
    admission by the ECM that some documents had indeed gone astray. In her
    view the cumulative effect of these factors was that Mrs  Sajid  should
    be given the "benefit of the doubt". The author of the grounds  queries
    why that finding was not expressed more clearly as a  positive  finding
    in Mrs Sajid's favour that the Rules had in fact been met.  That  is  a
    good point: this being an 'old style'  appeal  the  matter  could  then
    simply have been allowed under the Rules.

11.  The  second  feature  which  caused  Judge  Simpson  concern  was  the
    inordinate delay  that  had  occurred  between  Mrs  Sajid  making  her
    application for entry clearance in October 2013 and  the  matter  being
    listed before the First-tier Tribunal in March  2016.    Judge  Simpson
    was justifiably struck by the length of  that  wait  for  this  genuine
    couple. I would add my own regret at that passage  of  time:  it  would
    seem that it arose in part due to listing difficulties in the  Tribunal
    and in  part  due  to  the  application  being  'shelved'  pending  the
    resolution of the challenge in MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ 985.

12. It was these features, in addition to the other matters  listed  above,
    which in the opinion of Judge Simpson rendered this particular decision
    disproportionate.  This was, it appears to me, a finding which was open
    to Judge Simpson on the evidence before her.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    properly directed itself that to allow the appeal on Article 8  grounds
    some particularly compelling  feature  would  need  to  be  identified.
    Having applied that  direction  the  appeal  was  allowed.  Whilst  the
    features identified may not have weighed heavily with another Tribunal,
    I cannot say that hers was an irrational decision.


    Decision


13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain  an  error  of
    law such that the decision must be set aside.
