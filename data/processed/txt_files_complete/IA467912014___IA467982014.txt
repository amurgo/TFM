For the Appellants:    Mr A Chohan, SZ, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the appellants against a decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge  Cameron)  dismissing  their  appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision made on 10 November 2014  refusing  them  further
    leave as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) and partner.



Background

 2.  The appellants are citizens of Pakistan.   The  first  appellant  ("the
    appellant") was born on 2 February 1986 and the second  appellant,  her
    dependent partner for the purposes of this application, was born on  23
    January 1986. The appellant was  granted  leave  to  enter  the  UK  in
    October 2006 as a student and was subsequently granted an extension  of
    leave in the same capacity and then as a Tier 4 (General) Student.   On
    4 September 2014 she applied for further leave to remain as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant.

3.   Her application was refused on 10 November 2014 as the  respondent  was
    not satisfied that she was  able  to  meet  the  requirements  of  para
    245DD(b) as she had failed to produce evidence as specified under  para
    41-SD(e)(iii) to show that since before 11  July  2014  and  up  to  no
    earlier than three months before the date of her  application  she  had
    been continuously engaged in business activities, which did not  amount
    to activities pursuant to a contract of service with a  business  other
    than her own.  It was the respondent's view that the appellant did  not
    have a right of appeal as her leave to remain had expired on 21  August
    2014.  However, on that issue, the First-tier Tribunal Judge held  that
    the present application should be treated as made on 20 August 2014  as
    the respondent had failed to discharge the assertion  that  a  previous
    application was invalid because the specified fee had  not  been  paid.
    The appellant, therefore, had a right of appeal as the application  was
    valid by virtue of the appellant having section 3C leave.

The Hearing of the First-tier Tribunal

4.   The judge went on  to  consider  whether  the  appellant  had  met  the
    requirements of  para  41-SD(e)(iii)  of  showing  trading  covering  a
    continuous period commencing before 11 July 2014 and up to  no  earlier
    than three months before the date of her application,  which  had  been
    refused because the respondent was not  satisfied  that  the  documents
    provided covered the period before 11 July  2014.   The  appellant  had
    submitted a leaflet and a booklet but they were found not to  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules  as  they  were  not  dated.  Business  cards
    submitted were also not dated and failed  to  state  the  services  the
    company provided.  The appellant had also relied on a  Gumtree  on-line
    print-out but that was posted on 14 August 2014 which, as it post-dated
    11 July 2014, was not acceptable evidence.  The appellant also provided
    a company website but again this was  not  acceptable  as  it  was  not
    registered until after 11 July 2014.

5.   At the hearing before the judge the appellant said that so far  as  the
    advertising material was concerned on 18 June 2014 she had arranged for
    the printing.  She was not  sure  of  the  design  and  had  gone  back
    afterwards and asked for the materials to be  printed.   She  had  been
    sent an invoice by email on 4 July 2014.  When she received the proofs,
    she had contacted  them.   She  had  paid  in  cash  and  obtained  the
    brochures on 8 August 2014.  She had  then  distributed  the  materials
    mostly in Ilford and had given out her cards and brochures and that was
    how she had started her advertising.  The judge recorded at  [17]  that
    the appellant was asked if the proofs were ready on 18 June and sent on
    4 July when she had physically received and distributed them. She  said
    that it was probably 10 July.  She  had  paid  ï¿½900  and  received  100
    copies on 10 July and the rest  on  8  August.   She  thought  she  had
    ordered 500 of each. In cross-examination she accepted that the Gumtree
    notice had been posted on 14 August 2014 and the website registered  on
    23 July 2014.

6.   It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that  the  evidence  could
    not support a finding that the appellant was  trading  before  11  July
    2014 whereas it was argued on her behalf that she  had  obtained  cards
    and leaflets, collecting the initial supply on 10  July  and  that  her
    chronology was  supported  by  the  invoice  dated  4  July  2014.   It
    followed, so it was submitted, that the appellant had  shown  that  she
    had at least one  source  of  advertising  and  had  produced  evidence
    showing that this was before the date of application.

7.   Having considered the evidence relating  to  the  documents  the  judge
    dealt with the issue as follows:-

         "32. The appellant states that she did provide advertising material
             in the form of a brochure and that  this  would  therefore  be
             sufficient. She states the brochure was dated 4 July 2014  and
             that the respondent  overlooked  the  date  mentioned  on  the
             marketing material.

         33.  In support of her statement she  refers  to  an  invoice  from
             Sandhu Innovations which is dated 4 July 2014  and  refers  to
             their  undertaking  services  'in  connection  with   business
             website designing, designing the letter  head,  business  card
             and providing A4 leaflets and business cards'.

         34.   The  appellant  in  her  oral  evidence  indicated  that  she
             collected 100 of these documents on 10 July and the  remainder
             on 8 August. Although she stated  in  evidence  that  she  had
             thought she had ordered 500 of each  the  invoice  appears  to
             indicate that it was 1000.

         35.  The appellant has also provided at page 21  of  the  bundle  a
             proof of presumably the leaflet and at page 22 a copy  of  the
             business card. There is a further document at  page  23  which
             has a date of the 18 June 2015.

         36.  It is clear that it  is  for  the  appellant  to  provide  the
             required specific documents at the date of application.  There
             is no dispute between the appellant and  the  respondent  that
             the appellant must show one or more of the following specified
             documents in relation to advertising or marketing material.

         37.  The appellant has provided a number  of  documents  which  she
             states were provided to the  respondent  in  relation  to  her
             leaflets and business cards.  It is however the case that  the
             documents submitted by the appellant within her bundle are not
             dated other than the document at page 23 which has the date of
             18 June 2015 and clearly does not  comply  with  the  relevant
             requirements.

         38.  The only document submitted by the appellant in support of her
             appeal  that  she  submitted  advertising   material   for   a
             continuous period commencing before 11 July 2014 and up to  no
             earlier than three months before the date of  the  application
             is an invoice from Sandhu Innovations.  There is  no  evidence
             from the appellant that this particular document was  in  fact
             submitted to the respondent.   The  appellant's  statement  at
             paragraph 21 of her witness statement that she had provided  a
             brochure dated 4 July 2014 is not supported from the  evidence
             she has submitted as the leaflet at page 21, which  presumably
             is the brochure she is referring to, given  that  the  invoice
             refers to leaflets and business cards only, does  not  have  a
             date on it.

         39.  Although I have considerable sympathy for the appellant  given
             that she met the other requirements  of  the  rule  I  am  not
             satisfied that she has shown on  a  balance  of  probabilities
             that at the date  of  application  she  provided  evidence  of
             advertising  or  marketing  material  showing  a  commencement
             before 11 July 2014."

The Grounds and Submissions

8.   In the grounds it is argued that the judge failed  to  distinguish  the
    evidence that was submitted with the application that was dated 4  July
    2014  including  visiting  cards,  letterhead  and  brochure  and   the
    continuing evidence that was included as part of the appellant's bundle
    which was dated June 2015.  It is further argued that the  judge  erred
    at [32] when he said that the appellant stated that  the  brochure  was
    dated 4 July 2014 and that the respondent overlooked the date mentioned
    on the marketing material whereas at para 21 of her statement she  said
    that the brochure was dated 18 June 2014.

9.   Permission to  appeal  was  refused  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  but
    granted by the Upper Tribunal for the following reasons:

         "The appeal concerns  the  issue  of  whether  the  appellants  had
         provided specific evidence (advertising material) as required under
         paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii).  The issue rested on the material that had
         been sent with the application (see paragraph 16 of the grounds  in
         which it is asserted that the documents sent with  the  application
         included the invoice of 4 July 2014.).  The respondent's bundle did
         not include all  the  documents  that  had  been  provided  by  the
         applicant and the judge did not appear to  make  any  reference  to
         what documents had been placed in the respondent's bundle and  what
         had not.  Consequently in the  light  of  that  ambiguity  and  the
         effect upon the decision reached, I grant permission.

         When the matter is listed before the Upper Tribunal the  respondent
         should ensure that a full copy of the bundle is  available  to  the
         Tribunal  including  the   documents   that   did   accompany   the
         application."

10.  At the hearing before me Mr Chohan relied on  his  grounds  arguing  in
    particular that the judge had not appreciated that the invoice dated  4
    July 2014 had  accompanied  the  application.   He  accepted  that  the
    evidence relating to Gumtree and the website post-dated  11  July  2014
    but the position was  different  so  far  as  the  visiting  cards  and
    brochure were concerned.  He submitted that the documents at pages  20-
    24 of the bundle had all been included with  the  application.  At  the
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal it was his recollection that the
    Presenting Officer had looked through the  file  and  agreed  that  the
    documents had been received.  He submitted therefore that the judge had
    erred in law by failing to take into account the date on the invoice of
    4 July 2014 and the appellant's oral evidence about how  the  brochures
    and other documents were obtained and put into use.

11.  Although the respondent has failed  to  provide  a  full  copy  of  the
    bundle as requested when permission was granted, Mr Tufan was  able  to
    confirm that the documents referred to by the  appellant  were  on  the
    case file save for the invoice dated 4 July 2014  which  he  could  not
    immediately find.  He submitted that the judge had  reached  a  finding
    properly open to him on the evidence and had been entitled to find that
    the appellant had failed to provide evidence with  her  application  of
    advertising or  marketing  material  showing  the  business  commencing
    before 11 July 2014.

Consideration of whether the First-tier Tribunal erred in law

12.  The relevant part of the Rules the appellant had to meet and  which  is
    in dispute between the parties is whether the  appellant  provided  the
    following evidence:

         "(iii)   one or more of the following specified documents covering,
             either together or individually a continuous period commencing
             before 11 July 2014 or 6 April 2015 (as applicable) up  to  no
             earlier than three months before the date of his application:

             (i)  advertising or marketing material, including printouts of
                  online advertising, that has  been  published  locally  or
                  nationally

                  (a)  showing the applicant's name (and  the  name  of  the
                      business if applicable) together  with  the  business
                      activity; or

                  (b)  where his business is trading on  line,  confirmation
                      of his ownership of the domain name of the business's
                      website."

13.  It is clear that the judge was not satisfied that the invoice  dated  4
    July 2014 had been included  with  the  documents  submitted  with  the
    application.  It is argued that the judge misunderstood the appellant's
    evidence in this respect and that she had stated that she had submitted
    the invoice for 4 July 2014.

14.  In para 21 of the appellant's witness statement  dated  3  August  2005
    she said:

         "I submit that contrary  to  the  respondent's  contention,  I  had
         indeed provided a brochure that was  dated  4  July  2014.   For  a
         reason unknown to me the caseworker overlooked the  date  mentioned
         on this marketing material.  I am enclosing an invoice from  Sandhu
         Innovations confirming that I had obtained my marketing material on
         4 July 2014 and proof of the brochure dated the same.  (Page  20-21
         of the appellant's bundle)."

15.  The judge made the point that the brochure submitted  at  page  21  was
    undated and that there was no evidence from  the  appellant  that  this
    particular  document,  the  invoice,  was  in  fact  submitted  to  the
    respondent.  It is argued that the judge  misunderstood  the  assertion
    the appellant was seeking to make in para  21  of  her  statement.   It
    referred to a brochure dated 4 July 2014 whereas it  is  common  ground
    that the brochures were not dated and indeed this was  the  reason  for
    the respondent not accepting them as meeting the  requirements  of  the
    Rules.  The only document that was dated 4 July 2014 was  the  invoice.
    It was for the judge to assess the evidence and it was open to  him  to
    find that the invoice dated 4 July 2014 had not been submitted with the
    application.

16.  However, I am satisfied there was evidence before the  judge  that  the
    documents submitted pre-dated 11 July 2015. At [23] there is a business
    card dated 18/06/15 but that was dismissed by the respondent and by the
    judge as not meeting the other  requirements  of  the  Rules.  However,
    according to para 41-SD(e)(iii) documents submitted must cover,  either
    together or individually, a continuous period commencing before 11 July
    2014.  There is no reason why the one  dated  document  should  not  be
    taken into account in  considering  whether  the  advertising  material
    submitted as a whole indicates a business was being carried out  before
    11 July 2014.  There is nothing to indicate  that  the  judge  had  any
    doubts about whether  that  document  was  genuine  and  there  was  no
    suggestion that the date was inaccurate.  The judge therefore erred  by
    failing to consider the documents submitted  cumulatively  as  well  as
    individually and it follows that he erred in law by failing to consider
    the documents together as required by the Rules.

Re-making the Decision

17.  I am satisfied that the  judge's  error  was  such  that  the  decision
    should be set aside and re-made. Both  representatives  were  satisfied
    that if that was the case I should proceed to re-make the decision.   I
    am satisfied that there was documentary  evidence  submitted  with  the
    application from which it can properly be inferred that the appellant's
    business was being carried out before 11 July 2014.  The  date  on  the
    business card of 18 June 2015  assessed  in  the  light  of  the  other
    documents submitted satisfies me at least on a balance of probabilities
    that the requirements of the Rules were  met.  Accordingly  the  appeal
    should be allowed.



Decision

18.  The First-tier Tribunal erred in law and the decision is set aside.   I
    re-make the decision by allowing the  appeal  against  the  refusal  of
    entry clearance as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur).
