Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Malik (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   I shall refer to the parties as "the appellant" and  "the  Respondent".
    This is an error of law hearing to consider whether or not there  is  a
    material error  of  law  in  the  decision  the  Designated  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge McCarthy) ("FTT") promulgated  on  4th  April  2017  in
    which he dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction.



Background

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Philippines and she applied  for  an  EEA
    residence card as an extended family member.

FTT decision

3.       The FTT followed the decision in Sala [2016] UKUT  00411  (IAC)  in
    finding that the 2006 EEA Regulations do not provide a right of  appeal
    to a person relying on Regulation 8 as an extended family member.

Application for permission to appeal

4.   In grounds it was contended that the FTT erred by following Sala  which
    was not binding and/or was wrong and the FTT had jurisdiction  to  hear
    the appeal.

Permission grant

5.   Permission was granted by FTJ Chamberlain who  found  that  there  were
    arguable grounds showing an error having regard to Khan [2017] EWCA Civ
    1755 in which it was decided that  a  refusal  to  an  extended  family
    member was an appealable decision.

Discussion and conclusion

6.   Both parties were agreed that the judgment in Khan  was  presently  the
    applicable law.  Whilst there was a judgment  from  the  Supreme  Court
    pending, the time scale was not known. I agreed that the most pragmatic
    course to take was to remit the matter to the First-tier  Tribunal  for
    hearing.

Decision

7.   There is a material error of law in the decision  which  shall  be  set
    aside.  The appeal is to be remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  at
    Taylor House (not before DFTJ McCarthy) for a hearing de novo.
