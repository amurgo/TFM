Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Richardson, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms E Savage, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant was born on 4th  February  1983  and  is  a  national  of
    Pakistan.  He applied on 10th May 2014  for  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  under  the  Points
    Based System (PBS).  The respondent refused  his  application  on  16th
    June 2014. He appealed against the respondent's decision at  a  hearing
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Rose (the  Judge)  at  Sheldon  Court,
    Birmingham, on 14th October 2014. The Judge dismissed the appeal on all
    grounds in a determination promulgated on 22nd October 2014.

 2. The appellant was granted permission to appeal against the decision  of
    the Judge by First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio on 2nd  February  2015  for
    the following reasons:

         The judge had dismissed the appeal on the basis that the  applicant
         submitted the relevant  information  requested  by  the  respondent
         after the date of decision. In the onward  grounds  of  appeal  the
         applicant notes there is  proof  of  posting  of  a  document  from
         Pakistan and  a  letter  requesting  extension  of  time  from  the
         respondent.  He also asserts that the letter from HMRC was received
         by the respondent before the date of decision.  It is  argued  that
         the judge failed to consider whether the Rules are met.

         I find that once the  respondent  decided  to  exercise  discretion
         under paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules there was a  bit  of
         room for flexibility with regards to the receipt of documents.  The
         judge  recognised  this  at  paragraph  18  of  the  determination.
         However bearing in mind  one  of  the  documents  was  coming  from
         Pakistan and the applicant had written for the extension of time to
         submit documents which he found difficult in  obtaining  the  judge
         should  have  considered  whether  the  respondent  exercised   its
         discretion correctly particularly as the  respondent's  case  notes
         reflected that the appellant had requested an extension.   In  view
         of the evidence from the applicant  there  should  have  been  more
         consideration  of  the  failure  of  the  respondent  to   exercise
         discretion in favour of the applicant before concluding that  there
         was no breach by the respondent to deal fairly with the applicant's
         application.  All  the  grounds  are  arguable  as  there   is   an
         identifiable error of law as argued.

 3. The matter accordingly came before me to determine whether  the  making
    of the Judge's decision involved the making of an error on a  point  of
    law. The respondent indicated opposition to the appeal  in  advance  of
    the hearing under Rule 24 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008.  The respondent contends that the  Judge  directed  himself
    properly and without error; the computerised case notes make clear that
    the respondent did not have all  the  required  evidence  by  the  date
    requested or thereafter.  The respondent  asserts  that  there  was  no
    obligation having once extended time for documents to be  submitted  to
    continue to do so; the appellant should have provided all the  required
    documentation at the date of application;  there  could  have  been  no
    expectation that discretion once exercised would continue to flow.

 4. The application was made on 10th May 2014 and the refusal was  for  the
    following reasons set out in the respondent's letter  dated  16th  June
    2014. The appellant was found to have failed to meet  the  requirements
    of paragraph 245DD(b) and paragraph 41 of Appendix A of the Immigration
    Rules  because specified documents had not been submitted as  required.
    The respondent disallowed the 25 points claimed by the appellant  under
    Appendix A for Access to Funds of ï¿½50,000 claimed by the  appellant  to
    be available to him from a third party.  The  appellant  was  noted  to
    have provided a  bank  letter,  a  declaration  from  Mrs  Ghazala  w/o
    Muhammad Asim Khan and a legal  representative  letter  from  M  Farhan
    Afzal.

 5. The respondent found the legal  representative  letter  from  M  Farhan
    Afzal to be unacceptable as it did not contain  the  number,  place  of
    issue and dates of issue and  expiry  of  Mr  Farhan  Afzal's  identity
    documents. The specified evidence under paragraph 41-SD was accordingly
    absent and the respondent found a lack of proof of access to  funds  as
    claimed by the appellant.  The application was further refused  because
    the appellant claimed points for  being  self-employed  but  failed  to
    show, in accordance with Appendix A,  that  he  had  been,  on  a  date
    falling within 3 months prior to the date  of  application,  registered
    with HMRC as self employed. The respondent contacted the  appellant  on
    19th May 2014 to request submission of the necessary documents by  29th
    May 2014. In particular, the appellant was asked to submit the original
    welcome letter from  HMRC  containing  his  unique  taxpayer  reference
    number.  Following the respondent's finding that the  appellant  failed
    to produce these documents the application was  refused  on  16th  June
    2014.

 6. The Judge took account in paragraphs 5 - 10 of his determination of the
    appellant's written and oral evidence. In  his  written  statement  the
    appellant said that he had been waiting to receive a letter  containing
    his unique taxpayer reference number from the HMRC; on 29th May 2014 he
    had sent his business contract to the Home  Office  and  explained  the
    HMRC position. He stated that his Pakistani  legal  representative  had
    posted a letter to the Home Office with the necessary details  on  28th
    May 2014. In his oral evidence the appellant told the Judge he did  not
    receive the Home Office letter dated 19th May 2014 requesting documents
    until 27th May 2014.  He said that he contacted his  representative  in
    Pakistan who posted a letter directly to the Home Office; he  sent  his
    business  contract  with  a  letter  of  explanation  that  his   legal
    representative's letter was coming from abroad and might therefore take
    a few days to arrive.

 7. At paragraph 10 of his determination the Judge records further evidence
    he heard during submissions from the appellant about his  contact  with
    HMRC that he had subsequently received from them which he had sent.  He
    added: "I apologise I have missed the proof  of  posting,  otherwise  I
    would have sent that as well". In his findings the Judge noted that  it
    was not disputed that the appellant had not  sent  the  welcome  letter
    with his application.  In his witness statement the appellant said that
    he had supplied online confirmation that he was registered  with  HMRC,
    but the welcome letter may take 4 - 6 weeks to  arrive.   On  29th  May
    2014 he was told by HMRC that it would take 10 working days or more for
    the letter with his unique taxpayer reference  number  to  arrive.   On
    29th May 2014 HMRC told him that they would issue the letter again  and
    it would take "more than two weeks" to come.

 8. Having considered  the  evidence  before  him  the  Judge  reached  the
    following findings in paragraph 18 and 19 of his determination:

         18. The documents in the appellant's bundle included a letter  from
         HMRC dated 29th  May  headed  "Confirmation  of  UTR".   I  am  not
         satisfied that this letter was submitted to the Home Office  before
         the date of decision.  The appellant's evidence  was  that  he  had
         received it in the first week of June and posted it as soon  as  he
         received it.  He was then asked when he had  sent  the  letter  and
         said: "as soon as I received it, I think within the first  10  days
         of June."  In my judgment, if as  he  claimed,  the  appellant  had
         chased HMRC for the letter, knowing that it  was  required  by  the
         Home Office, had received it after the deadline  specified  by  the
         Home Office for the submission of the further  documents,  and  had
         then sent it to the Home Office, it is  improbable  that  he  would
         have no more specific recollection or record of when he sent it.

         19. There was a post office receipt dated 29th May.  I  infer  that
         that related to the appellant's letter to the Home Office  at  page
         21 of the appellant's bundle, in which he asked for a few more days
         in order to submit the documents requested. The  Home  Office  case
         notes record receipt of a  letter  requesting  further  time.   The
         appellant accepted in his evidence that he had no proof of  posting
         in respect of the letter from HMRC which he claimed to have sent in
         early June.  There was no explanation as to why he had not obtained
         proof of posting in respect of that letter.

 9.  The  Judge  did  not  consider  the  Home  Office  case  notes  to  be
    determinative as to whether, or when, documents were received from  the
    appellant. However, he found no indication in the Home Office  printout
    that any documents were received from the appellant on  or  after  30th
    May, apart from the letter requesting further time to produce documents
    and a contract for work. The Judge found that  no  inference  could  be
    drawn from the wording of the notice of  decision  that  documents  had
    been received after 29th May 2014. In the  light  of  all  the  matters
    before him the Judge endorsed, in paragraph 22  of  his  determination,
    his finding that he could not be satisfied that the welcome letter  was
    submitted to the respondent before the date  of  decision.   The  Judge
    observed that he could not therefore have regard to  the  document  now
    contained in the appellant's bundle in determining the appeal under the
    Immigration Rules.

10. Mr Richardson's submission to me in relation to  the  Judge's  findings
    about the  HMRC  letter  was  that  his  reasoning  is  not  sound.  Mr
    Richardson contended that the Judge gave flimsy reasons  for  rejecting
    the evidence of the appellant because he had no proof  of  posting  and
    could not remember  the  specific  date  of  sending  the  letter.   Mr
    Richardson submitted that there was evidence before the  Judge  of  the
    letter dated 29th May 2014, but the appellant was frank in relation  to
    the HMRC letter in stating that he could not remember, or provide proof
    of, the date of sending to the Home Office.

11. Mr Richardson submitted that the appellant's oral evidence  of  sending
    the letter to the Home Office in the first part of June should not have
    been disbelieved because there  would  have  been  no  reason  for  the
    appellant not  to  have  sent  the  letter  as  soon  as  possible.  Mr
    Richardson submitted that the appellant had taken all steps  to  obtain
    the necessary documents and to keep the Home  Office  informed  of  his
    progress. The Judge should accordingly have found  that  the  appellant
    sent the HMRC letter with his  UTR  as  claimed,  before  the  date  of
    decision.

12. Mr Richardson further relied upon a document he obtained from the Upper
    Tribunal in advance of the hearing before me relating to  this  appeal.
    He said that a letter dated 11th June 2014 from the  appellant  to  the
    respondent had  been  retrieved  from  the  Tribunal  file  and  he  is
    instructed that this letter was before  the  Judge  at  the  First-tier
    hearing but had been overlooked by the Judge. It is the covering letter
    sent by the appellant with  the  HMRC  letter  to  the  respondent.  Mr
    Richardson submitted that it is strongly likely that  this  letter  was
    sent as claimed and it serves to undermine the findings of  the  Judge.
    The appellant would be bound to have sent the further evidence  in  the
    light of the extension of time by the respondent for doing so.

13. I reject the submission for the  appellant  that  the  Judge's  finding
    about the HMRC letter is not  sustainable.  I  find  that  he  properly
    reached his conclusion on the evidence before him that the  letter  was
    not shown to have reached the respondent by the  date  of  decision.  I
    consider the submission that the appellant's  letter  dated  11th  June
    2014  must  have  been  before  the  Judge  to  be   speculative;   the
    circumstances suggest otherwise.  The  letter  found  its  way  to  the
    Tribunal or the Upper Tribunal at some stage but it was not included in
    the appellant's bundle before the Judge; it is not  referenced  in  the
    appellant's statement dated 3rd  October  2014  which  was  before  the
    Judge.  Other documents submitted, such as a Royal  Mail  receipt,  the
    legal representative's letter and  its  courier  service  receipt,  are
    specifically referred to in the appellant's statement.

14. The Judge set out the content of the  written  statement  and  gives  a
    detailed account of the appellant's oral evidence. In the oral evidence
    recorded by the Judge the appellant makes no mention   at  all  of  the
    letter of 11th June 2014 but said firstly that the HMRC letter had,  he
    thought, been received by him in the first  week  of  June  and  posted
    immediately to the respondent, but then that he thought he had sent the
    letter within the first ten days of June.  His evidence was found to be
    uncertain by the Judge and I find it unlikely that the appellant  would
    fail to refer at all to the 11th June letter when questioned if it  had
    been before the Judge as now claimed.

15. There was in any event a lack of any proof of posting of  this  letter,
    aside from the appellant's oral evidence which  was  not  accepted.   I
    find that the judge did not err by failing to find that  the  appellant
    would have, or must obviously have, sent the HMRC letter in time to the
    respondent simply because it was in his interests to do so or  that  he
    would have no reason not to do  so.   Such  findings  would  have  been
    speculative on the part of the Judge.

16. The appellant was represented at  the  First-tier  hearing,  albeit  by
    different solicitors from those now instructed, and the Judge  recorded
    the submissions made to him  at  the  hearing.   No  reference  by  the
    appellant's representative to the 11th June 2014 letter is recorded  by
    the Judge  at  paragraph  13  of  his  determination.  He  records  the
    submission that the  appellant's  case  is  put  on  the  basis  of  an
    inference from the notice of decision that documents had been  received
    by the respondent, an inference specifically rejected by the Judge.  It
    was submitted for the appellant before the Judge, without reference  to
    the 11th June letter, that the documents had been received in time  and
    that the respondent had acted unfairly.

17. This leads to the next submission before me for  the  appellant  by  Mr
    Richardson that  the respondent acted unfairly and that the Judge erred
    in failing to make that finding and by failing to find that  discretion
    should have been exercised differently by allowing greater  flexibility
    to the appellant and under paragraph 245AA of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    In this regard I accept the submissions  for  the  respondent  from  Ms
    Savage that whilst the Secretary of State may  exercise  discretion  in
    applying flexibility to the evidence there is no obligation to  do  so.
    An extension of time was allowed to the appellant to  submit  documents
    but the extension did not have to be renewed.

18. I find that that the Judge gave proper and  adequate  consideration  to
    this issue in paragraph 23 of his determination when he dealt with  the
    paragraph 245AA ground of appeal before him.  His previous findings set
    out in the determination and those made in  paragraph  23  in  my  view
    support his conclusion that the appellant failed to establish that  the
    respondent had acted in breach of any obligation to  deal  fairly  with
    his application. The Judge took account of and gave  due  consideration
    to all the relevant facts and I find that  he  properly  dismissed  the
    appeal for the reasons given. I am therefore further satisfied that the
    Judge  did  not  err  in  law  by  finding,  in  paragraph  25  of  his
    determination,  that  it  was  unnecessary  for  him  to  consider  the
    remaining issue  of  the  letter  from  the  legal  representative.   I
    therefore give no further consideration to the  submissions  before  me
    about the legal representative's letter  made  by  Mr  Richardson.  The
    appellant's appeal in the Upper Tribunal fails.

Notice of Decision

19. I find that making of the Judge's decision did not involve  the  making
    of an error on a point of law. It follows that decision of  the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  stands  and  this  appeal  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  is
    dismissed.

Anonymity

    The position remains that the First-tier  Tribunal  made  no  anonymity
    order.
