For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal came before the Upper Tribunal on 29 November 2018, when  I
    found material errors of law in the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Eban  and  adjourned  the  appeal  for  a  resumed  hearing  with
    directions. A copy of that  decision  and  reasons  promulgated  on  22
    January 2019 is appended.  The directions  were  complied  with  and  a
    short bundle of evidence was submitted on 12 March 2019 with statements
    from the Appellant's stepmother, Pushpa Kumari Gurung, his half-brother
    Joshvir Gurung as well as statements from the Appellant and his Sponsor
    and father, Mr Jhamu Gurung.  Also appended  to  those  statements  are
    previous decisions from Judge Abebrese on  2  November  2011  where  he
    allowed the appeal under Article 8 and a decision of Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Cockrill  promulgated  on  8  May  2012,  dismissing  the
    appeal.

     Hearing

 2. Unfortunately there was no Nepali interpreter in court and after taking
    instructions, Mr Shepherd informed the Tribunal that the Appellant  was
    able to give evidence in English. I therefore agreed to proceed to hear
    the evidence  on  the  basis  and  understanding  that  if  there  were
    difficulties in comprehension that the appeal could be adjourned  to  a
    new date in the near future with a Nepali interpreter present.

 3. The Appellant  was  called  to  give  evidence  where  he  adopted  his
    statement dated 11 June 2018.  He was cross-examined by Mr Bramble  who
    asked if he currently worked or studied or whether he did anything  for
    the community. The Appellant replied in the negative.  Aside  from  his
    immediate family, the Appellant stated he had one cousin and when asked
    what he would do if he succeeded with the appeal, he said he would look
    after his father who has paid for him and looked  after  him  since  he
    arrived in the UK in 2007 and he would do that by working  hard.   When
    asked what work he would do, given that he had not worked in the UK  or
    Nepal, the Appellant said he would  do  any  kind  of  job,  albeit  he
    accepted that he had not worked in  Nepal  because  his  father  looked
    after him financially. He accepted his father  had  a  farm  in  Nepal,
    although he said that it did not  produce  enough  food  and  that  his
    father still owned the farm.  He said no-one was looking after it.   He
    was not able to say really how big it was and when asked why  he  could
    not work in Nepal the Appellant stated he did not study enough  and  it
    was hard to find a job there.

 4. In response to my questions, the Appellant  stated  that  he  had  been
    living in Pokhara, that he had not had contact with  his  mother  since
    2007, albeit he had been told she was still in Pokhara.  There  was  no
    re-examination.

 5. The appellant's father, Mr Jamhu Gurung, then gave evidence and adopted
    his statement dated 11 June 2018.  He was asked in examination-in-chief
    whether when he came to the UK if  he  made  any  application  for  the
    Appellant to join him, to which he replied that at  that  time  Gurkhas
    were not allowed to bring family over and if he had tried it would  not
    have worked. The witness confirmed that he owned a farm in Nepal, which
    he described as a rupani. He said it was the size of a football  ground
    and the farm grew wheat, rice,  corn,  vegetables  and  some  tea.   Mr
    Gurung stated that his ex-wife, the  appellant's  mother,  was  looking
    after the farm and that he did not really have contact with her because
    she was very bitter when the marriage ended.

 6. In cross-examination, the previous decision of Judge Cockrill  was  put
    to the witness at [22] where it states that the witness gained  custody
    of the Appellant following his divorce, which the  witness  agreed  was
    correct.  He agreed that his second wife was a British citizen and that
    he had obtained his British passport in 1992 having previously come  to
    the UK on a six month fianc� visa and had then been  granted  leave  to
    remain as a spouse.  The witness said he had not sought legal advice as
    to whether he could bring his son to the UK because he knew that he was
    not able to do this and that he had made the application in  2007  once
    he saw that other Gurkhas were bringing their children over.

 7. When asked if the Appellant was unsuccessful what would stop  him  from
    returning to Nepal and living on the farm, the witness stated  that  if
    he went back to Nepal his mother would not want to see him and  he  did
    not think the Appellant could go and live with her, because she was not
    only bitter towards him but towards all the children and does not  want
    to see them.  The witness stated his other son in Nepal had a  business
    buying and selling and doing whatever he could.   When  asked  why  the
    Appellant could not do this too, the witness stated that he  has  lived
    in the UK a long time, he did not think he  would  be  happy  or  could
    manage in Nepal.

 8. In respect of whether the witness would be able  to  continue  to  send
    funds to him, he accepted that whilst he was supporting  the  Appellant
    now because he was not allowed to work in the UK, that he had  to  look
    after his family and himself; that he had paid his British Army pension
    to his ex-wife and that was now hers and that he continued to work full-
    time at the Ministry of Defence as a civil  servant.   However  he  was
    going to be 70 in July of this year and  would  not  continue  to  work
    indefinitely. There was no re-examination of the witness.

 9. The appellant's half-brother, Mr Joshvir Gurung, was briefly called  to
    give evidence  where  he  confirmed  his  statement  and  that  he  was
    currently 23 years of age. He said that he worked full-time as  a  life
    insurance broker.  When asked if the Appellant works in the UK or  what
    work the Appellant could do in the UK, he stated that he is a very good
    chef and very good in the kitchen and cooked mostly Nepali food.   When
    asked further questions by Mr Shepherd as whether he had  contact  with
    people outside the family, the witness stated that  the  Appellant  has
    friendship groups in Farnborough.

     Submissions

10. In his submissions, Mr Bramble sought to rely upon the refusal  letter.
    He submitted that the Appellant could not succeed under Appendix  K  of
    the Immigration Rules, which was a point  accepted  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant.   Thus  the  issue  was  whether  the  Appellant   met   the
    requirements of Article 8 outside the Rules.  His case was not based on
    paragraph 276ADE(vi) of the Immigration Rules and  whether  there  were
    potentially very significant obstacles to his integration in Nepal.

11. Mr Bramble submitted given that this was a situation  of  relationships
    between adults and there was no evidence that there were more than mere
    normal emotional ties between the family members. Therefore,  he  would
    argue that this was not a family life case but a private life case  due
    to the length of residence.

12. Mr Bramble also sought to distinguish the  Appellant's  case  from  the
    normal "Gurkha" cases where the case law  is  quite  clear  that  where
    there has been  historic  injustice  along  with  no  poor  immigration
    history or other issues, which was sufficient to waive the requirements
    in favour of the Appellant.  He submitted this case was slightly unique
    in that the sponsor had come to the UK to marry his second wife and did
    not come to the UK as a  Gurkha  but  as  a  fianc�  and  had  attained
    settlement and British citizenship  as  a  spouse  not  a  Gurkha.   He
    submitted the other previous decisions were academic and this was not a
    sole responsibility case. [10] of the decision of Judge Cockrill  shows
    that the Appellant's father had custody of him.  Therefore,  there  was
    an avenue for the Sponsor to have brought the Appellant over to the  UK
    as a child because the Sponsor was settled  whilst  the  Appellant  was
    still a child.

13. Mr Bramble submitted that the Appellant's status in the UK  has  always
    been precarious and that his private life was generated at a time  when
    he was a visitor and then an overstayer.  He accepted the Appellant  is
    not dependent on the public purse, but he is financially  supported  by
    his father.  He was not disputing the genuineness of the  relationships
    with his family members in the UK, nor that the Appellant wants to  get
    work if he attained status.  However, he was a 38 year old man with  no
    medical problems,  he  does  have  family  members  in  Nepal  and  the
    financial support of his father.  He has a limited education and skills
    set.  Whilst he has been out of the  country  since  2007,  Mr  Bramble
    queried whether that was sufficient given that he can speak  Nepali  as
    well as English and to justify allowing his appeal on Article 8 grounds
    outside the Rules.  He submitted it was not and that once the  historic
    injustice aspect was removed, that this was an ordinary  case  with  no
    compelling factors which go in the Appellant's favour.

14. In his submissions, Mr Shepherd did not seek  to  rely  on  a  skeleton
    argument aside from the previous one  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dated 12 June 2018.  He submitted  that  it  was  manifestly  important
    derived from the evidence of the Sponsor that he was  unable  to  apply
    for his son to come to the UK when he  came  to  the  UK  himself.   Mr
    Shepherd submitted it was a unique case in the context  of  the  Gurkha
    adult dependent cases because the Sponsor came as a fianc� and that did
    not allow him to bring his son with him.  However he sought to rely  on
    the decision in Gurung and that, but for the  historic  injustice,  the
    Sponsor would have settled in the UK at  a  time  when  his  dependants
    would have been able to accompany him  under  the  age  of  18  and  he
    therefore would have brought his child, but for the fact  that  Gurkhas
    were not permitted to do so.

15. Mr Shepherd submitted the Appellant has formed a private life in the UK
    over the past eleven years, he has friends, he cooks for the family, he
    is in a loving and supportive nuclear family set up and has  lost  ties
    with his mother in Nepal.  He submitted that had the Appellant not been
    prevented  from  coming  to  the  UK  in  the  first   instance,   this
    conversation  and  argument  would  not  be  happening.   Mr   Shepherd
    submitted that the historic injustice  is  a  powerful  aspect  in  the
    balance of  proportionality  and  should  resolve  the  appeal  in  the
    Appellant's favour.

     Findings and Reasons

16. I begin consideration of the appeal by having regard  to  the  previous
    decisions of the First tier  Tribunal,  as  I  am  required  to  do  by
    Devaseelan [2002] UKIAT 00702. However,  the  decision  of  First  tier
    Tribunal Abebrese, which was promulgated on 2.11.11 and  at  which  the
    Appellant was neither present  nor  respresented,  appears  to  contain
    findings  relating  to  a  different  Appellant  and  was  subsequently
    overturned by the Upper Tribunal, albeit the decision and  reasons  are
    not available. Thus I place no weight on that decision.

17. The appeal, which was against a decision by the  Respondent  dated  May
    2008 refusing to grant ILR, then came before First tier Tribunal  Judge
    Cockrill for hearing on 27 April 2012. There was no appearance by or on
    behalf of the Appellant. The Judge proceeded to  determine  the  appeal
    with reference to paragraph 317 of the Immigration Rules and  dismissed
    it. There was no reference to the arguments currently before me  as  to
    the particular position of Gurkhas and historic injustice.  Thus  I  do
    not derive particular assistance from this  decision,  apart  from  the
    finding that the Appellant did not qualify for leave to remain  in  the
    UK pursuant to paragraph 317 of the Rules.

18. The extant appeal relates to an application  for  leave  to  remain  on
    human rights grounds,  which  was  made  on  15  September  2016.  This
    application was refused in a decision dated 6 June 2017  on  the  basis
    that the Appellant did not fall within the Home Office policy  set  out
    at Annex K of the Immigration Rules  in  respect  of  the  children  of
    former  Gurkhas;  the  Appellant  had  not  shown  that  he   met   the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE(vi)  of  the  Rules  and  it  was  not
    accepted that the historic injustice caselaw is  applicable  and  there
    were no exceptional circumstances justifying a grant of  leave  outside
    the Rules.

19. The Respondent's position in both the refusal and before me is that the
    historic injustice caselaw is not applicable to this Appellant's  case.
    This is because his father and Sponsor was discharged from the  British
    army in 1987 and came to the UK the same  year  as  a  fianc�  and  not
    pursuant to any of the Gurkha policies which came into force from  2004
    onwards, initially only with regard to those who had retired within the
    previous two years. Thus the primary  question  I  need  to  decide  is
    whether or not the historic injustice caselaw does apply on  the  facts
    of this case.

20. In Ghising and others (Ghurkhas/BOCs: historic  wrong;  weight) [2013]
    UKUT 00567 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal held inter alia as follows:

         "59. ...where Article 8 is held to be engaged and the fact that but
         for the historic wrong the Appellant would have been settled in the
         UK long ago is established, this will ordinarily determine the
         outcome of the proportionality assessment; and determine it in an
         Appellant's favour. The explanation for this is to be found, not in
         any concept of new or additional "burdens" but, rather, in
         the weight to be afforded to the historic wrong/settlement issue in
         a proportionality balancing exercise. That, we consider, is the
         proper interpretation of what the Court of Appeal were saying when
         they referred to the historic injustice as being such an important
         factor to be taken into account in the balancing exercise. What was
         crucial, the Court said, was the consequence of the historic
         injustice, which was that Gurkhas and BOCs:

             "were prevented from settling in the U.K. That is why the
             historic injustice is such an important factor to be taken
             into account in the balancing exercise and why the applicant
             dependent child of a Gurkha who is settled in the UK has such
             a strong claim to have his article 8(1) right vindicated,
             notwithstanding the potency of the countervailing public
             interest in maintaining of a firm immigration policy". [41]

         In other words, the historic injustice issue will carry significant
         weight, on the Appellant's side of the balance, and is likely to
         outweigh the matters relied on by the Respondent, where these
         consist solely of the public interest just described.

         60.  Once this point is grasped, it can immediately be appreciated
         that there may be cases where Appellants in Gurkha cases will not
         succeed, even though their family life engages Article 8(1) and the
         evidence shows they would have come to the United Kingdom with
         their father, but for the injustice that prevented the latter from
         settling here on completion of his military service. If the
         Respondent can point to matters over and above the "public interest
         in maintaining of a firm immigration policy", which argue in favour
         of removal or the refusal of leave to enter, these must be given
         appropriate weight in the balance in the Respondent's favour. Thus,
         a bad immigration history and/or criminal behaviour may still be
         sufficient to outweigh the powerful factors bearing on the
         Appellant's side. Being an adult child of a UK settled Gurkha ex-
         serviceman is, therefore, not a "trump card", in the sense that not
         every application by such a person will inevitably succeed. But, if
         the Respondent is relying only upon the public interest described
         by the Court of Appeal at paragraph 41 of Gurung, then the weight
         to be given to the historic injustice will normally require a
         decision in the Appellant's favour."

21. The Sponsor's evidence as set out in his  witness  statement  dated  11
    June 2018 at [5] is that when he left the British  army  in  1987,  the
    Appellant was only 6 years old and would have been able  to  settle  in
    the UK as his dependent if he had been allowed to settle.  However,  he
    was not allowed to and he would have done  if  he  had  been  permitted
    because he held a senior position in the  British  Army  and  was  well
    qualified for employment in the UK and  so  would  have  been  able  to
    provide his family with all the support they needed and they would have
    been able to grow up in safety and with  modern  education  and  health
    services available to them. In his oral evidence,  the  Sponsor  stated
    that because he knew he was not permitted to bring the Appellant to the
    UK he only did so in 2007  once  other  Gurkhas  began  bringing  their
    children over.

22. I find that the Sponsor is  entirely  credible  witness.  His  military
    conduct is described in his certificate of service  by  his  Commanding
    Officer as exemplary ie. the highest level. There was no attempt by  Mr
    Bramble to impugn his evidence, which was that he  would  have  brought
    the Appellant to settle with him in the UK had he been permitted so  to
    do. I have concluded in light of the judgments in Ghising (op cit)  and
    Gurung [2013] EWCA Civ 8 that the Sponsor was prevented from  settling
    in the UK as a retired Gurkha, which would have enabled him  to  settle
    with his family members. The fact that he married a British citizen and
    so obtained settlement via a different immigration route is  irrelevant
    and does not detract from his  entitlement  to  rely  on  the  historic
    injustice argument.

23. I find that the Appellant has established  close  ties  with  his  half
    brother and stepmother during  this  time,  as  they  attest  in  their
    witness statements and the oral evidence of Joshbir Gurung, who was  12
    at the time the Appellant came to live with the family and has no other
    siblings. I find, in light of the judgment in Rai v ECO [2017] EWCA Civ
    320 at [18]-[20] that the Appellant has been living in  a  family  unit
    with his father, stepmother and half brother for the past 11 and a half
    years and the relationship between them can properly  be  described  as
    constituting family life.

24. In respect of the statutory public interest considerations set  out  in
    section 117B of the NIAA 2002,  I  find  that,  having  given  evidence
    competently in English that the Appellant does speak English and  that,
    although he is not permitted to work, his presence has not impacted  on
    the public purse as he has been financially supported throughout his 11
    and a half years in the UK by  his  father,  who  is  employed  by  the
    Ministry of Defence.

25. It is clear from [60] of the judgment in Ghising that,  absent  factors
    such as criminality or a bad immigration  history,  the  weight  to  be
    given to the historic injustice will normally require a decision in the
    Appellant's  favour.  Mr  Bramble  submitted,   correctly,   that   the
    Appellant's status in the UK has always been precarious  and  that  his
    private life was generated at a time when he was a visitor and then  an
    overstayer.

26. The Appellant's immigration history is that he obtained a 6 month visit
    visa and arrived in the United Kingdom on 16 September 2007. He made an
    in time application for ILR, pursuant to paragraph 317 of the Rules  on
    19 February 2008, which was refused in a decision dated 14 May 2008. He
    was neither present nor represented at the appeal hearings  before  the
    Tribunals, which ultimately resulted in the  decision  and  reasons  of
    Judge Cockrill dismissing his appeal. On 28 April 2016,  the  Appellant
    wrote  to  the  Respondent  enquiring  as  to  the  progress   of   his
    application. Thus it appears  for  unknown  reasons  that  the  refusal
    decision of 14 May 2008 had not been served. On 22  June  2016  he  was
    informed that his appeal had been dismissed and copies of the  decision
    and reasons were sent  to  him.  On  15  September  2016,  he  made  an
    application for leave to remain as  the  adult  children  of  a  former
    Gurkha, which led to the decision of 6 June 2017, which is the  subject
    of the extant appeal.

27. The question is whether  this  outweighs  the  historic  injustice  and
    renders the Appellant's removal proportionate. I find that this is  not
    a case where the Appellant has gone  to  ground  but  rather  that  the
    Appellant does not  appear  to  have  received  the  appeal  decisions,
    otherwise he would not have  written  on  28  April  2016,  asking  for
    progress in his application. Following receipt of the  appeal  decision
    and reasons on 22 June 2016,  he  instructed  solicitors  to  make  the
    application  current  under  appeal.  The  application  form  and   the
    Appellant and Sponsor's statements  are  dated  23  August  2016.  Thus
    whilst his immigration history cannot be described as good, I find that
    there are reasons why the Appellant became  an  inadvertent  overstayer
    and that he and his father acted  in  a  reasonably  prompt  manner  to
    remedy the situation.

28. I have concluded on the particular facts of the case, for  the  reasons
    set out above, having full  regard  to  the  public  interest  and  the
    historic injustice element balanced against the Appellant's established
    family and private life in the United  Kingdom,  that  removal  of  the
    Appellant would not be proportionate

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A O'Callaghan, Counsel instructed by N.C.
                    Brothers & Co. solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nepal  born  on  5  February  1981.   He
    arrived in  the  UK  on  16  September  2007  with  a  visit  visa  and
    subsequently made unsuccessful applications  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain as the dependant of a relative present and settled  in  the  UK.
    He appealed against that decision.  His appeal was allowed but then set
    aside  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  subsequently  dismissed.   On  15
    September 2016, the Appellant applied for leave to remain on the  basis
    he is the adult child of a former Gurkha who had been discharged  prior
    to 1 July 1997.  On 6 June 2017 the Respondent refused the application.
     The Appellant appealed and his appeal came before First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Eban for hearing on 13 June 2018.

 2. In a decision and reasons promulgated on 27 June 2018, the  appeal  was
    dismissed, the judge finding at [24] that the Appellant's father  would
    not have come with the Appellant upon discharge from the  British  Army
    because by that time the family unit had already broken down and he was
    in a new relationship. She noted that the Appellant's  father  came  to
    the UK to marry the  year  he  ceased  service  as  a  Gurkha  and  she
    proceeded to find that it would not  be  unjustifiably  harsh  for  the
    Appellant to return to Nepal.

 3. Permission to appeal was sought, in time, on the basis that  the  judge
    had erred materially in law:  firstly  in  finding  that  the  test  of
    proportionality does not involve the requirement of  exceptionality  in
    light of the decision in  ZB  (Pakistan)  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  834.   She
    submitted the judge further had erred in failing to apply the  judgment
    in Gurung [2013] EWCA Civ 8:

         "If a Gurkha can show that but for the historic injustice he  would
         have settled in the UK at a time  when  his  dependant  (now  adult
         child) would have been able to accompany him as a child  under  the
         age of 18,  that  is  a  strong  reason  for  holding  that  it  is
         proportionate to permit the adult child to  join  the  family  now"
         [42]

 4. The grounds submitted that the relevant finding is what the Gurkha  can
    show in relation to his settlement  in  the  UK  at  a  time  when  the
    Appellant would have been able to accompany him.   It  does  not  state
    that the Gurkha needs to show that he would have applied for the  child
    to accompany him.  The grounds sought to rely on [5] of  the  Sponsor's
    statement:

         "When I left the British Army in 1987 Birendra was only 6 years old
         and so would have been able to settle in the UK as my dependant  if
         I had been allowed to settle. Birendra would have undoubtedly  been
         able to settle as my dependent child."

 5. Permission to appeal was granted in a decision dated 2 October 2018  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge P J M Hollingworth, on  the  basis  that  the
    matters relied upon in the permission application at [7] and  [8]  have
    been accorded insufficient weight and that it was arguable at [9]  that
    the  judge  has  applied  too  high  a  test  in  the   assessment   of
    proportionality.

     Hearing

 6. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal, Ms O'Callaghan on  behalf  of
    the Appellant sought to rely on the issue of historic  injustice.   She
    noted at [19] the judge accepted that  the  Appellant  had  established
    private life in the UK and accepted that the Sponsor would have applied
    to come to the UK, however, not with the Appellant as he had  formed  a
    new relationship and came to the UK to marry the year he ceased service
    as a Gurkha.  In respect of the Sponsor, while she acknowledged he  was
    not present at the hearing before the First tier Tribunal, the issue of
    whether or not he would have applied for his son to come to the UK with
    him at the time of his discharge was not raised at  any  point  in  the
    refusal decision or at the hearing and it was not  an  issue  that  was
    challenged.  She submitted that the finding by the judge that due to  a
    family breakdown the Sponsor would not have applied for his son to join
    him is contrary to the evidence in his statement.  She  submitted  that
    it was never a live issue in the case until after the hearing, when  it
    became one in light of the judge's findings.  Ms O'Callaghan  submitted
    that the separation of the parents did not in and of itself  mean  that
    the Sponsor would not have applied for the Appellant to come to the  UK
    at the time,  that  no  weight  had  been  attached  to  the  Sponsor's
    statement and no finding made as to the evidence the Sponsor did  give.



 7. She further submitted that no weight had been placed on  the  different
    nature of the policy from the Rules and the fact, for example, there is
    no requirement to meet the language requirements. The point was whether
    the Appellant could have accompanied the Sponsor rather than whether he
    would have accompanied him and that the judge had failed to  apply  the
    correct  test  as  set  out  in  Gurung.   In  any  event  and  in  the
    alternative, the judge's findings were not based on the evidence before
    her.  She submitted that there were no factors such as criminality or a
    bad immigration history by the Sponsor  or  the  Appellant  that  would
    outweigh the historic wrong and that weight should have  been  attached
    to this as part of the proportionality exercise.

 8. In her submissions, Ms Pal submitted at [17] that the judge found  that
    there was no family life established  between  the  Appellant  and  his
    father.  They re-met when the Appellant was 26, having  been  separated
    for twenty years.  The judge did find at [19] that the Appellant had  a
    private life in the UK by virtue of being in the UK for  almost  eleven
    years. At [20] to [21] the judge considered whether there would  be  an
    interference with his private life and at [22] onwards, considered  the
    proportionality exercise.  She submitted that the judge did  accept  at
    [24] that the Appellant's  father  may  have  applied  to  settle  upon
    discharge, if that had been open to him at the time rather than come to
    the UK as a fianc�.  However the judge also found that had the  Sponsor
    made that application he would  not  have  applied  to  come  with  the
    Appellant as, by that time, the family unit had  broken  down  and  the
    Appellant's father was in a new relationship.  The judge further  found
    that the year the Sponsor's service ceased as a Gurkha was the year  he
    came to the UK to marry.

 9. Ms Pal submitted that the judge further found  there  was  no  evidence
    that the Sponsor sought to bring the Appellant over whilst he was still
    a minor, although this was possible between  April  1989  and  February
    1999 and the Sponsor made no attempt to facilitate entry at a time when
    he could have done so.   She  submitted  that  the  historic  injustice
    arguments do not assist the Appellant in light of the findings at  [24]
    and the finding there was no family life between the Appellant and  the
    Sponsor.  She submitted that the  judge  was  entitled  to  make  those
    findings of fact.  The judge at [25] considered the factors as  to  why
    the Respondent's decision was proportionate, noting that the  Appellant
    did not speak English and at [10] that he had been in the UK for eleven
    years without leave and thus his private life was precarious.   Ms  Pal
    submitted that the judge did not materially err in  law  and  that  her
    decision should stand.

10. In reply, Ms O'Callaghan submitted that the family life point was not a
    relevant consideration for the purposes of the appeal  given  that  the
    judge found that private life existed and Article 8(2) was engaged, see
    Ghising at [54] where reference is made  to  both  family  and  private
    life. She submitted the judge has erred in placing  no  weight  on  the
    Sponsor's evidence in terms of not applying for the Appellant  to  come
    to the UK.  She submitted  that  historic  injustice  should  be  given
    substantial weight over and above the other factors at [56] of  Ghising
    and what would outweigh those factors.  She invited the Upper  Tribunal
    to allow the appeal and if  it  was  considered  there  was  sufficient
    evidence, to remake the decision.

     Findings and reasons

11. I find material errors of law in the decision of  First  tier  Tribunal
    Judge Eban. Whilst the Judge did not have the benefit of oral  evidence
    from the Appellant's Sponsor and father as he was unable to attend  due
    to prior work commitments, the Judge failed to take account of material
    evidence viz [5] of the Sponsor's witness statement, where he sets  out
    in terms that if he had been eligible to settle in the UK when he  left
    the British army in 1987 the Appellant would undoubtedly have been able
    to settle in the UK. Whilst the Judge was entitled to find  that  there
    was no evidence that the Sponsor  had  applied  for  the  Appellant  to
    settle in the UK as his dependent under the Rules whilst he was still a
    minor, I find she further failed to take into  consideration  the  fact
    that settlement under the Rules is much more onerous than that pursuant
    to the Home Office policy in relation to Gurkhas and that,  given  that
    the Appellant's mother is alive, it would have been necessary  to  show
    that the Sponsor had sole responsibility for him  or  that  there  were
    exceptional or compelling circumstances rendering  his  exclusion  from
    the UK undesirable.

12. I further find that these errors materially  impacted  on  the  Judge's
    decision  that  there  were  no  exceptional  circumstances  justifying
    consideration of Article 8 outside the rules  and  the  proportionality
    assessment,  such  that   her   conclusions   in   this   respect   are
    unsustainable.

     Notice of decision

13. For the reasons set out above, I set aside the decision  of  the  First
    tier Tribunal Judge and adjourn the appeal for a hearing de novo before
    the Upper Tribunal.

14. I make the following directions:

                            ____________________

                                 DIRECTIONS

                            ____________________

1.   The appeal is to be listed for 2 hours on the first available date.

2.   Witness statements from the Appellant and Sponsor, his  stepmother  and
stepbrother to stand as evidence in chief, which should  be  served  on  all
parties 5 working days before the hearing.

3.    If  a  Nepali   interpreter   will   be   required   the   Appellant's
representatives must inform the Upper Tribunal in advance of  the  re-listed
hearing.

4.   The parties are to use their best endeavours to obtain  copies  of  the
decisions of the Tribunal dated 11.11.11, 8.12.11 and 27.4.12 to  be  served
on all parties in advance of the re-listed hearing.
