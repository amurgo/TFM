                                     and

               The Secretary Of State For The Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. In my letter to the parties of 16 August 2013,  I  stated  that  the
       First-tier Tribunal's  decision  that  the  appellant's  removal  to
       Indonesia would not violate the  appellant's  rights  and,  to  that
       extent, the appeal must fail.


    2. In the letter I gave my explicit view that a determination in  these
       terms did not, without more, sanction  the  appellant's  removal  to
       Iran.


    3. I proposed to determine the appeal in the following terms  unless  I
       received a proposal to the contrary within 14 days:


         The First-tier Tribunal did not  err:  its  decision  was  properly
         motivated and made it clear that removal to Indonesia  was  lawful.
         The Upper Tribunal would emphasise that there has been no  decision
         that removal to Iran would be lawful,  and  would  not  regard  the
         Tribunal's  decision  as  justifying  the  Secretary  of  State  in
         removing the appellant to Iran.


    4. There has been no response to my proposal.


DECISION

    The Judge made no error on a point of law and the original
    determination of the appeal shall stand.





                                                               ANDREW JORDAN
                                                 JUDGE OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
