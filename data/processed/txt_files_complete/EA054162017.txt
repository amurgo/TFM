Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Pountney, Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit
For the Respondent:    Mr C Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1.  The  appellant  appeals  with  permission  against  the  decision   of
    Designated First-tier Judge McClure, promulgated  on  23  January  2018
    dismissing her appeal against a decision of the respondent taken on  25
    May 2017 to refuse her an EEA residence card.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Gambia and is married to EJ, a citizen of
    the Netherlands.  They have a child born in 2013.

 3. The appellant's case  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  that  her
    husband was exercising treaty rights in the United  Kingdom;  or,  that
    she is entitled to a derivative right of residence in  accordance  with
    the principles set out in Zambrano [2011] EUECJ C-34/09, Dereci  [2011]
    EUECJ C-256/11 and Alokpa [2013] EUECJ C-6/12 on the basis as the child
    is a citizen of the EU and now in full-time education, he has  a  right
    to remain in the United Kingdom and thus the appellant derives a  right
    to remain here from the child's right to remain in the United Kingdom.

 4. The respondent's case was that the  appellant  is  not  entitled  to  a
    residence card as there was no  evidence  that  EJ  had  ever  been  in
    gainful employment in the United Kingdom nor that he had carried  on  a
    business, was self-sufficient or was otherwise a qualified person.  The
    respondent relied on evidence from HMRC to the effect that there was no
    record of him ever having worked or paid tax  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    The respondent did not accept either that the appellant was entitled to
    a derived right of residence in the United Kingdom.

 5. The judge heard evidence from the appellant as well as submissions from
    Mr Pountney who  appeared  for  the  appellant  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal as he does before us.  Before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the
    respondent was represented by Mr Phillips.

 6. The judge held that:-

      i) EJ was never a qualified person [15] and thus the appellant was not
         entitled to any rights under  the  Regulations  stemming  from  her
         marriage to EJ [16];

     ii) Zambrano, Dereci and Alokpa fell to be distinguished on the grounds
         that they considered the rights of an  EU  national  child  in  the
         country of their  nationality  [20],  [22]  and  [24],  not  an  EU
         national child in another EU state;

    iii) having had regard to Articles 20 and 21 TFEU as well as Articles 7,
         12 to 14 of Directive 2004/38  ("the  Citizenship  Directive"),  in
         order for there to be rights derived from a child there would be  a
         need to have comprehensive sickness insurance which  had  not  been
         provided.  The child had therefore not acquired rights;

     iv) the child is not a qualified person  either  as  a  self-sufficient
         person or as a student as he did not  have  comprehensive  sickness
         insurance, nor was there evidence of resources to ensure  that  the
         child  and  his  mother  will  not  become  dependent  upon  social
         assistance [39];

      v) the appellant and his mother did not fall within  Regulation  16(2)
         of the EEA Regulations and there was no  evidence  that  they  were
         self-sufficient (Reg 16(2)); or with regard to Regulation 16(3)  as
         the EU parent had never been a worker in the  United  Kingdom  nor,
         with respect to Regulation 16(5) could it be said to apply as there
         is no evidence that the child will not be able  to  reside  in  the
         country of his nationality, the Netherlands  [43];  and,  thus  the
         child will not have to leave the EU [44].

 7. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had erred:-

      i) In not engaging with the argument that the appellant had a right to
         reside in the  United  Kingdom  pursuant  to  Zambrano  as  if  the
         appellant had to leave the United Kingdom her  son  would  have  no
         choice but to  leave  the  EU  relying  in  part  on  Ahmad  (Amos;
         Zambrano; Reg 15A(3)(c) [2006] EEA Regs) [2013] UKUT 00089;

     ii) in finding on the evidence before him that the child would be  able
         to reside in the Netherlands, the appellant's son not being able to
         reside with his father due to domestic violence; and as neither the
         appellant or her son spoke Dutch, had any friends or family in  the
         Netherlands other than her husband's family or had ever been to the
         country; and, that there would be difficulties for the appellant in
         obtaining health insurance in the Netherlands; and,  in  line  with
         Ahmad, the judge should have considered whether it  was  reasonable
         for the appellant and her son to relocate to the Netherlands;

    iii) in failing to take into  account  the  EU  Charter  of  Fundamental
         Rights and Freedoms which was engaged in  this  case,  specifically
         Articles 7 and 24; and, that it was in the child's  best  interests
         to remain in the United Kingdom;

     iv) in not having regard to Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and
         Immigration Act 2009.

 8. On 4 April 2019 Upper Tribunal Judge Allen granted permission.

 9. We heard submissions from both parties.  Mr Pountney submitted that the
    judge appeared not to have properly understood Alokpa, thereby focusing
    only on the laws that related to citizens who are  in  the  country  of
    nationality, rather than the factual  situation  in  Alokpa  where  the
    children in question were French nationals living  in  Luxembourg  with
    their mother who was a citizen of Togo.  Mr Pountney submitted that the
    child could not go there to the Netherlands without his mother and that
    the mother would require health insurance as was seen from  a  document
    issued by the Dutch authorities (appellant's bundle, page 87).

10. Mr Pountney submitted that the appellant was in a "Catch  22"  scenario
    in that the she could not  get  health  insurance  in  the  Netherlands
    unless she was there; and, she  could  not  get  there  without  having
    health insurance.

11. Mr Pountney submitted that it could not be considered as  proportionate
    pursuant to Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms
    to require the family to go to the Netherlands as they had never  lived
    there, had no connections, did not speak the language and that it  will
    be difficult accordingly for the mother to obtain a job.

12. Mr Bates submitted  that  the  appellant  was  wrong  to  rely  on  the
    concession given by the Secretary of State in Ahmad given that this was
    withdrawn when  it  went  to  the  Court  of  Appeal,  reported  as  NA
    (Pakistan) v SSHD [2015] EWCA 140.  It also  had  to  be  seen  in  the
    context of the response from the Court of Justice to the questions  put
    to it by the Court of Appeal by way of preliminary reference.

13. Mr Bates submitted that in this case the mother would have a "Zambrano"
    right in the Netherlands.  At present the child would be able to reside
    in the Netherlands and would require health insurance but he  submitted
    that not all the necessary steps had been taken in the circumstances of
    applying to the Netherlands.  It was submitted it was unlikely that, as
    the mother would get three months initially, that the Netherlands would
    impose impossible conditions on them.

14. Mr Bates submitted further that there were  in  terms  of  Article  7/8
    avenues pursuant to the Immigration Rules which the family could follow
    and asked us to note that there  was  no  removal  decision  made.   He
    accepted that there had been no reference to Article 7 of  the  Charter
    in the decision.

15. In response, Mr  Pountney  submitted  that  the  judge  had  failed  to
    consider what difficulties the appellant and the child would  face  and
    had failed properly to ask the question of whether at the  end  of  the
    day the child would have to leave the European Union.

The Law

16. We bear in mind that the sole ground of appeal in this case is that the
    decision was contrary to the United Kingdom's obligations  pursuant  to
    the EU Treaties.  That is, of necessity, wider than an appeal solely on
    the basis  that  the  decision  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  EEA
    Regulations.

17. It is, we consider, appropriate to start with the  decision  in  Alokpa
    which concerned a Togolese national, living in Luxembourg,  caring  for
    her children who were French nationals.  As in this  case,  Mrs  Alokpa
    had no right to remain in Luxembourg and her children born there had an
    EU nationality through their father.  It was not in  dispute  that  the
    children had never enjoyed a family life with their father nor had they
    exercised their right to free movement [18].  The  court  characterised
    the question put as follows:

         "21  Therefore, question referred by the  national  court  must  be
         construed as seeking  to  ascertain,  in  essence,  whether,  in  a
         situation such as that at issue in the main  proceedings,  Articles
         20 TFEU and 21 TFEU  must  be  interpreted  as  meaning  that  they
         preclude a Member State from  refusing  to  allow  a  third-country
         national to reside  in  its  territory,  where  that  third-country
         national has sole responsibility for her  minor  children  who  are
         citizens of the European Union, and who have resided  with  her  in
         that  Member  State  since  their  birth,  without  possessing  the
         nationality of that Member State and having made use of their right
         to freedom of movement.


         22   In  that  regard,  it  should  be  recalled  that  any  rights
         conferred on third-country nationals by the  Treaty  provisions  on
         Union citizenship are not autonomous rights of those nationals  but
         rights derived from the exercise of freedom of movement by a  Union
         citizen. The purpose and justification of those derived rights,  in
         particular rights of entry and residence of  family  members  of  a
         Union citizen, are based on the fact that a refusal to  allow  them
         would  be  such  as  to  interfere  with  freedom  of  movement  by
         discouraging that citizen from exercising his rights of entry  into
         and residence in the host Member State (see, to that effect, Case C-
         87/12 Ymeraga and Ymeraga-Tafarshiku [2013] ECR  I-0000,  paragraph
         35 and the case-law cited)."


18. The court held as follows:-

         "32  Concerning, in the second place, Article 20  TFEU,  the  Court
         has held that there are very specific situations in which,  despite
         the fact that the secondary law on the right of residence of third-
         country nationals does not apply and the  Union  citizen  concerned
         has not made use of his freedom of movement, a right  of  residence
         cannot, exceptionally, without undermining the effectiveness of the
         Union citizenship that citizen  enjoys,  be  refused  to  a  third-
         country national who is a family member of his if, as a consequence
         of refusal, that citizen would be obliged in practice to leave  the
         territory of the European Union altogether, thus  denying  him  the
         genuine enjoyment of the  substance  of  the  rights  conferred  by
         virtue of the status of citizen of the European  Union  (see  Iida,
         paragraph 71, and Ymeraga and Ymeraga-Tafarshiku, paragraph 36).


         33   Therefore, if the referring court holds that Article  21  TFEU
         does not  preclude  Mrs  Alokpa  from  being  refused  a  right  of
         residence in Luxembourg, that court must  still  determine  whether
         such a right of residence  may  nevertheless  be  granted  to  her,
         exceptionally - if the effectiveness of the Union citizenship  that
         her children enjoy is not to be undermined - in light of  the  fact
         that, as a consequence of such a refusal, those children would find
         themselves obliged in  practice  to  leave  the  territory  of  the
         European Union altogether, thus denying them the genuine  enjoyment
         of the substance of the rights conferred by virtue of that status.


         34   In that regard, as the Advocate-General stated  in  points  55
         and 56 of his Opinion, Mrs Alokpa, as the mother of Jarel  and  Eja
         Moudoulou and as sole carer of those children  since  their  birth,
         could have the benefit of a derived right to reside in France.


         35   It follows that, in principle, the refusal by  the  Luxembourg
         authorities to grant Mrs Alokpa a right of residence cannot  result
         in her children  being  obliged  to  leave  the  territory  of  the
         European Union altogether. It is, however, for the referring  court
         to determine whether, in the light of all of the facts of the  main
         proceedings, that is in fact the case. "


19. We have also had regard to Rendon-Marin [2016] EUECJ C-165/14  at  [78]
    to [79] where the court said this:

         "78  Thus, if - a matter which is for the referring court to check -
          the refusal to grant residence to Mr Rend�n Mar�n, a third-country
         national, to whose sole care those children  have  been  entrusted,
         were to mean that he had to leave the  territory  of  the  European
         Union, that could  result  in  a  restriction  of  that  right,  in
         particular the  right  of  residence,  as  the  children  could  be
         compelled to go with him, and therefore to leave the  territory  of
         the European Union as a whole. Any obligation on  their  father  to
         leave the territory of the European Union would thus  deprive  them
         of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights  which  the
         status of Union citizen nevertheless confers  upon  them  (see,  to
         this effect, judgments of 15 November 2011, Dereci and Others,  C-
         256/11, EU:C:2011:734, paragraph 67; of 8 November 2012, Iida, C-
         40/11, EU:C:2012:691, paragraph 71; of 8 May  2013,  Ymeraga  and
         Others, C-87/12, EU:C:2013:291, paragraph 36; and  of  10 October
         2013, Alokpa and Moudoulou, C-86/12, EU:C:2013:645, paragraph 32).


         79   Several Member States which have submitted  observations  have
         contended that Mr Rend�n Mar�n and  his  children  could  move  to
         Poland, the Member State of  which  his  daughter  is  a  national.
         Mr Rend�n Mar�n, for his part,  stated  at  the  hearing  that  he
         maintains no ties with the family of his  daughter's  mother,  who,
         according to him, does not reside in Poland, and  that  neither  he
         nor his children know the Polish language. In this  regard,  it  is
         for the referring court to check whether, in the light of  all  the
         circumstances of the main proceedings,  Mr Rend�n  Mar�n,  as  the
         parent who is the sole carer of his children, may in fact enjoy the
         derived right to go with them to Poland and reside with them there,
         so that a refusal of the Spanish authorities to grant him  a  right
         of residence would not result in  his  children  being  obliged  to
         leave the territory of the European Union as a whole (see, to  this
         effect, judgment of 10 October 2013, Alokpa and Moudoulou, C-86/12,
         EU:C:2013:645, paragraphs 34 and 35)."


20. We turn next to Ahmed (Amos; Zambrano; reg  15A(3)(c)  2006  EEA  Regs)
    [2013] UKUT 00089 (IAC) upon which the appellant has sought to rely  in
    her grounds.  At [68] the Upper Tribunal stated:

         "68. We accept that nothing said by the Court of Justice in any  of
         the Article 20 TFEU cases excludes  the  potential  application  of
         Zambrano  principles  to  third-country  national  parents  if  the
         practical effect of a refusal decision is  that  the  children  are
         obligated  to  leave  the  territory  of  the  Union  as  a  whole,
         notwithstanding that the children are not, as in Zambrano, citizens
         of the host member state. That was also the stated position  of  Mr
         Deller, Ms Asanovich and Mr Weiss.   Ordinarily in such a  case  it
         would be necessary  for  applicants  to  prove  that  the  children
         concerned were prevented from living in the territory of their host
         Member State (of nationality) together  with  their  parent(s)  and
         that may not be easy to do, given that for a child to have acquired
         citizenship of a Member State his  or  her  third-country  national
         parent will often have lived there lawfully in  the  past.  In  the
         appellant's case, however, there is no suggestion of  the  children
         being able to live with the father  and  Mr  Deller  said  that  he
         accepted that it was not realistic to expect that she could live in
         Germany with her children. He also accepted that for  her  and  her
         children there was no alternative Union  territory  location  other
         than the UK.  In  our  view  Mr  Deller  was  right  to  make  that
         concession. The appellant did not have any  immigration  status  in
         Germany nor could she rely in Germany on any EU right of  residence
         (to our understanding she would  only  be  entitled  to  reside  in
         Germany as a matter of EU law if able to show (as she clearly could
         not) that she was a self-sufficient parent in accordance  with  the
         principles set out by the Court of Justice in Chen  [2004]  ECR  1-
         9925).  Accordingly, in our judgment the appellant is able to  rely
         on her children's Article 20 right of Union citizenship  under  the
         Treaty."


21. It must, however, be borne in mind that this decision was  appealed  to
    the Court of Appeal both by the  appellant  and  by  the  Secretary  of
    State.  The first was reported at [2014] EWCA Civ 995 and resulted in a
    reference to the Court of Justice.  The Secretary of State's appeal was
    reported at [2015] EWCA Civ 140 where at [6] - [7] the Court of  Appeal
    said this about the concession made before the Upper Tribunal:

         "6.  At the adjourned hearing on the 19th and 20th of January  2015
         it was common ground that the Upper Tribunal's conclusion  that  NA
         had a Zambrano right to remain in the UK because she could not rely
         on any EU right of  residence  in  Germany  was  wrong.  As  German
         nationals, both of NA's daughters, MA and IA, are entitled to  live
         in Germany. If MA and IA were to move to Germany NA, who  is  their
         parent with sole care, would have a derived right of  residence  in
         Germany applying Zambrano principles.


         7.    The  Respondent  submitted  that  her  Presenting   Officer's
         concession before the Upper Tribunal (paragraph 5  above)  that  it
         was not realistic to expect that NA could live in Germany with  her
         children was a concession that was made  in  the  context  of  NA's
         Article 8 claim, and should not be construed as a  concession  that
         to deny NA a right of residence in  the  UK  would  compel  her  in
         practice to leave the territory of the EU together with MA and  IA.
         If the concession was to be so construed it was withdrawn as having
         been wrongly made. The Respondent did not dispute  the  Appellant's
         contention that refusing to grant NA, the sole parent with  custody
         and care of MA and IA, a right to reside in the UK would  force  MA
         and IA to leave the UK with her."


22. The questions put to the CJEU by the Court of Appeal were as follows:

         "30. Accordingly, we pose the following questions for the Court:


             (1)  Does an EU citizen have a  right  to  reside  in  a  host
             member  state  under  Articles  20  and  21  of  the  TFEU  in
             circumstances where the only state within the EU in which  the
             citizen is entitled to reside is his state of nationality, but
             there is a finding of fact by a competent  tribunal  that  the
             removal of the citizen from the host member state to his state
             of nationality would breach his rights under Article 8 of  the
             ECHR or Article 7 of the Charter?


             (2)  If the EU citizen in (1) (above) is  a  child,  does  the
             parent having sole care of that child have a derived right  of
             residence in the host member state if the child would have  to
             accompany the parent on removal of the parent  from  the  host
             member state?


             (3)  Does a child have a right to reside in  the  host  Member
             State pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation  1612/68  EEC  (now
             Article 10 of Regulation 492/2011/EU)  if  the  child's  Union
             citizen parent, who has  been  employed  in  the  host  Member
             State, has ceased to reside in the host  Member  State  before
             the child enters education in that state?"


23. The Court of Justice gave its ruling in June 2016, reported as  SSHD  v
    NA [2016] EUECJ C-115/15.  The court held this:-

         "79  Last, the Court has held  that,  where  Article 21  TFEU  and
         Directive 2004/38 grant a right to reside in the host Member  State
         to a minor child who is a national of another Member State and  who
         satisfies the conditions of  Article 7(1)(b)  of  that  directive,
         those same provisions allow a parent who is that national's primary
         carer to reside with that national in the host  Member  State  (see
         judgment  of  10 October  2013,  Alokpa  and  Moudoulou,  C-86/12,
         EU:C:2013:645, paragraph 29).


         80   The Court has held that a refusal to allow a parent, whether a
         national of a Member State or of a third country, who is the  carer
         of a minor child, who is a Union citizen and who  has  a  right  of
         residence under Article 21 TFEU and Directive 2004/38,  to  reside
         with that Union citizen in the host Member State would deprive that
         citizen's right of residence of any useful effect, since  enjoyment
         by a young child of a right of residence necessarily  implies  that
         the child is entitled to be accompanied by the person  who  is  his
         primary carer and accordingly that the carer must be in a  position
         to reside with the child in the host Member State for the  duration
         of such residence (see judgments of 19 October 2004, Zhu and Chen,
         C-200/02, EU:C:2004:639, paragraph 45, and 10 October 2013, Alokpa
         and Moudoulou, C-86/12, EU:C:2013:645, paragraph 28).


         81   In the light of the foregoing, the answer to  the  second  and
         third questions is as follows:


             -    Article 20 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning  that  it
             does not confer a right of residence in the host Member  State
             either on a minor Union citizen, who has resided  since  birth
             in that Member State but is not a national of that  State,  or
             on a parent who is a third-county national and  who  has  sole
             custody of that minor, where  they  qualify  for  a  right  of
             residence in that Member State under a provision of  secondary
             EU law.


             -    Article 21 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning  that  it
             confers on a minor Union citizen a right of residence  in  the
             host Member State, provided that that  citizen  satisfies  the
             conditions set out in Article 7(1) of Directive 2004/38, which
             it is for the referring court to determine. If so,  that  same
             provision allows the parent who is the primary carer  of  that
             Union citizen to reside with that citizen in the  host  Member
             State."


24. The important distinction between NA and this case is that  in  NA  the
    court held that there was no  derived  right  pursuant  to  Article  20
    because on the facts NA had a right of residence pursuant to Article 12
    of Regulation 1612/68) (see NA at paragraph 67). That is not applicable
    here.

25. Pausing there to take stock, we consider that it must be recalled  that
    a Zambrano right arises only when there is no other basis on  which  an
    individual has a right to remain in the host member state; that is what
    happened on the facts in NA and it is in that  context  that  the  CJEU
    held that Article 20 does not confer a right on the parent of a  minor;
    it was because she already had a right under a provision  of  Directive
    1612/68. That does not apply here as the appellant's husband had  never
    exercised Treaty Rights and so the provisions of Directive 1612/68  and
    its successor, Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 do  not  apply.  Given  the
    findings as to lack of sickness insurance and lack of self-sufficiency,
    there is no basis, other than a derived right on the basis  of  Alokpa,
    that the appellant could remain in the United Kingdom.

26. We consider that what Alokpa requires is a factual  evaluation  of  the
    circumstances of the non-EEA state parent and the children to determine
    whether the reality would be that the non-EEA child would  be  required
    to leave the territory of the EEA. This, we consider,  could  occur  if
    the parent caring for the child could  not  enter  that  state  of  its
    nationality, and the other parent cannot be traced.  The effect of this
    would be that the child would have to be separated if  they  could  not
    live in the host state.

27. There is an intersection here between Articles 7 and 24 of the  Charter
    of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms in that these inform the  assessment
    of whether the genuine enjoyment of child's rights would be  restricted
    to such an extent as to render them ineffective. This would, we accept,
    on the basis of domestic authorities be the case were the child to have
    to go into care.

28. In what is otherwise a very careful decision by an experienced judge it
    does not appear from the decision that consideration was  given  as  to
    whether the appellant (as opposed to her son) could go to live  in  the
    Netherlands.  It is not in doubt that she has sole care  of  the  child
    and that without her there would, in effect, be a  deprivation  of  the
    effective  enjoyment  and  substance  of  the   rights   conferred   on
    citizenship.  In effect the question that needs to be asked is  whether
    the appellant would be able to go and live in the Netherlands with  her
    son.  EU law was engaged in this case and accordingly, regard  must  be
    had to Article 7 and 24  of  the  Charter  of  Fundamental  Rights  and
    Freedoms.

29. Accordingly, we set  aside  the  decision  on  this  narrow  point  and
    accordingly, we remake the decision on that point, that is to  consider
    whether the appellant has shown that she would not  able  to  accompany
    her child.

    Remaking the decision

30. We heard evidence from the appellant, Mr Pountney having  explained  to
    us that the child's passport had now expired.  We accept that is so  as
    it is clear from the copy of the passport that it was valid only  until
    2018.

31. The appellant was asked what steps she had taken  to  renew  her  son's
    passport.  She said that she contacted the Consulate and been told that
    she needed the father's consent but that she was not  in  contact  with
    him.  She said she had been advised to  get  a  tracing  agent  to  get
    consent from him but that she did not have the means  to  do  so.   She
    said also that if he had been summoned to court and did not appear  and
    the judge made an order, that she would have the  rights  necessary  to
    obtain a passport.  She confirmed that the advice was given to her  but
    that she would start proceedings in the United Kingdom to obtain a  new
    passport for her son.  She said that her son  is  in  school,  will  be
    starting year two in September.

32. Cross-examined, the appellant said that she had explained everything to
    the Consulate but that  it  was  their  rule.   She  said  she  had  no
    documentary evidence and that it had all been done by  telephone.   She
    was asked if she enquired if there was any  other  way  that  he  could
    enter the Netherlands with an expired passport; she replied she did not
    think there is any other way.  It was put to her that she had not asked
    and just assumed that you need passports; she said they have no ties to
    the Netherlands and she does not have a permit to go there or a visa as
    he is still a minor.

33. The appellant was asked if she had made any enquiries if her son  could
    re-enter the Netherlands and ask what assistance  would  be  available.
    She said she did not think that there would be any  benefits,  that  it
    was not just him and that she would need to go as well.  She  said  she
    was not qualified and that he could not go without her.  Asked why  she
    would not be able to go work in the Netherlands if  allowed  to  enter.
    She said it is a Dutch speaking country and she does  not  speak  Dutch
    and had never been there.  She said if forced to choose between  living
    in the Netherlands and the Gambia she said it would be the Netherlands.

34. Mr Bates submitted that the appellant had failed to provide  sufficient
    evidence that they would be denied entry.  He asked us to note that  no
    formal application had been made; the evidence about the passports  was
    oral only and it was clear that not all avenues had been explored,  for
    example there was no attempt to obtain an emergency passport.  He asked
    us to note also that the appellant would have a Zambrano right  in  the
    Netherlands and that it was reasonable to assume that she would not  be
    forced to return to Gambia with the child.

35. Mr Bates submitted also that the child was not a qualified child of the
    United Kingdom, he was dependent on his mother and that  an  inadequate
    investigation had  been  made  as  to  what  he  would  obtain  in  the
    Netherlands.   He  submitted  that  although  there  may  be   language
    difficulties, if he went to live in the Netherlands he would  have  the
    added benefit of residing in the country of nationality.

36. Mr Pountney submitted that the appellant had given clear evidence  with
    regard to his entry into the Netherlands and that there was  no  reason
    to dispute that she had been in contact to resolve the issues.  He said
    that she had explained her difficulties with the  father  and  that  no
    other options were given to her  by  the  Dutch  authorities.   It  was
    submitted that there would be significant difficulties in going to  the
    Netherlands and so that in effect the appellant would have to leave the
    EU and so would her son; and, accordingly, Zambrano would then apply.

37.  Mr  Bates  drew  our  attention  to  the  protracted  nature  of   the
    proceedings.  The first application had been made in  2014  and  a  new
    decision had been made in 2015.  It had been once remitted,  remade  in
    2017 and now, some four years after the  decision,  it  was  still  not
    resolved.  It is submitted it was relevant whether it was reasonable to
    expect the appellant and her son to leave the United Kingdom given that
    he is now 6 and was established at school here.  He submitted  that  in
    all the circumstances it would not be proportionate.

38. It is for  the  appellant  to  show  that  she  could  not  go  to  the
    Netherlands to live with her son.

39. We accept that the child's passport has expired.  That  is  clear  from
    its expiry date.  We do not profess to have any knowledge of  what  the
    position is under Dutch law with regard to whether a single parent  can
    apply for a passport.  There are of  course  clearly  child  protection
    issues where one parent who is not living with the  other  and  applies
    for a passport.  We do not have the precise details of what is involved
    nor, surprisingly, has any written documentation been provided  to  us.
    It may well be that the Consulate would be satisfied with an order from
    a court for example giving all parental rights to the appellant but  we
    simply do not know.

40. We do not know whether it would be  possible  to  obtain  an  emergency
    passport and there is no indication that any such enquiries  have  been
    made.  Similarly, there appears to have been no proper application made
    by the appellant, nor does she appear to have set out  in  writing  the
    particular circumstances of her case and  asked  for  advice  from  the
    Dutch Consulate.  This deficiency was drawn to her attention in  cross-
    examination and also formed the basis of submissions.

41. We do not accept  the  material  referred  to  us  by  Mr  Pountney  is
    sufficient evidence to show that it  would  not  be  possible  for  the
    appellant to accompany her son to the Netherlands.  We note  the  email
    from the Dutch Immigration and Naturalisation Service at pages 87 to 88
    of the bundle but this was dated 7 November  2014.   We  note  that  it
    requires  the  mother  to  contact  the  Dutch  Embassy  to   issue   a
    facilitating visa  and  then  to  make  an  appointment  to  submit  an
    application.  There is no indication this has  been  done  or  that  an
    attempt has been made recently to do this.

42. We note that the letter concludes as follow:-

         "In addition, the following evidence is required in general:


           . a copy of a valid passport of the third country parent;


           . evidence that  both  the  community  national  and  the  third
             country national are insured for medical costs;"


43. It is the requirement for medical insurance which appears to be, as  Mr
    Pountney put it the main difficulty.  But what this letter does not say
    is what type of medical insurance would be sufficient.   Nor  for  that
    matter is it clear what is meant by "in general"; or whether that would
    apply here.

44. Whilst there is material, again from 2014 at pages 89 to 90  about  the
    requirements of health insurance in the Netherlands,  this  states  "he
    must take out  Dutch  health  insurance  within  four  months  of  your
    permanent residence permit."  It is unclear how this advice would apply
    in a situation as here.  The material at page 91  indicates  also  that
    those under 18 are insured for free but the point remains that what the
    appellant  has  not  done  is  make  a  proper  enquiry  to  the  Dutch
    authorities as to what difficulties she would  face  or  what  benefits
    would be available to her were she to be  located  to  the  Netherlands
    with her son.  It is instructive that there  is  no  indication  of  an
    email or other information sought by GMIAU from the  Dutch  authorities
    since 2014 on the health insurance point.   This  is  surprising  given
    their involvement with this from such an early stage.

45. Accordingly, we are not satisfied by the evidence before  us  that  the
    appellant has shown that she could not enter the Netherlands  with  her
    son or that she would not be able to access any social  support  there.
    We note also that the appellant, when questioned, said that  she  would
    prefer to live in the Netherlands with her son rather than in Gambia.

46. With regards to Article 7 and 24, we bear in mind that  these  were  in
    play in Alokpa, and that the CJEU identified a limited basis on which a
    derived right  could  arise,  that  is  that  there  needed  to  be  an
    evaluation of whether the children would have to leave the EU. We  bear
    in mind that the right  of  free  movement  is  not  absolute.   It  is
    circumscribed and it requires activities to be undertaken  -  see  Dano
    [2014] EUECJ C-333/13.  There is no evidence  of  treaty  rights  being
    exercised in this case either by the father or by the  child  and  thus
    there are no EU rights being exercised in the United Kingdom.  This has
    the effect that the child has no  right  of  residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

47. We remind ourselves that the CJEU has on several occasions stated  that
    it follows the case law of the ECtHR on Article 8 in assessing  article
    7 of the Charter. We consider also that, by analogy, CS [2016] EUECJ C-
    304/14, is relevant here in relation to the nature of the exceptions to
    the general rule that a right of residence is not granted to the third-
    country national family members of EU nationals who have not  exercised
    Treaty Rights.

48. In CS, the court stated:

         "29. In this connection, the Court has already held that there  are
         very specific situations  in  which,  despite  the  fact  that  the
         secondary law on the right of residence of third-country  nationals
         does not apply and the Union citizen concerned has not made use  of
         his freedom of movement, a right of residence must nevertheless  be
         granted to a third-country national who is a family member  of  his
         since the effectiveness of citizenship of the Union would otherwise
         be undermined, if, as a consequence of refusal  of  such  a  right,
         that citizen would be obliged in practice to leave the territory of
         the European Union  as  a  whole,  thus  denying  him  the  genuine
         enjoyment of the substance of the rights conferred by virtue of his
         status (see, to this  effect,  judgments  of  8 March  2011,  Ruiz
         Zambrano,  C-34/09,  EU:C:2011:124,  paragraphs 43  and  44;   of
         15 November 2011,  Dereci  and  Others,  C-256/11,  EU:C:2011:734,
         paragraphs 66  and  67;  of  8 November  2012,  Iida,  C-40/11,
         EU:C:2012:691, paragraph 71; of 8 May 2013, Ymeraga and Others, C-
         87/12, EU:C:2013:291, paragraph 36; and of 10 October 2013, Alokpa
         and Moudoulou, C-86/12, EU:C:2013:645, paragraph 32).


         30.  The above situations have the common  feature  that,  although
         they are governed by legislation which falls, a priori, within  the
         competence of the Member States, namely legislation on the right of
         entry and residence of third-country nationals outside the scope of
         provisions of secondary legislation which provide for the grant  of
         such a right under certain conditions,  they  nonetheless  have  an
         intrinsic connection with the freedom of movement and residence  of
         a Union citizen, which prevents the right of  entry  and  residence
         being refused to those nationals in the Member State  of  residence
         of that citizen, in order not to interfere with that freedom  (see,
         to this effect,  judgments  of  8 November  2012,  Iida,  C-40/11,
         EU:C:2012:691, paragraph 72, and of 8 May 2013, Ymeraga and Others,
         C-87/12, EU:C:2013:291, paragraph 37)."


49. Unlike in CS, in this case, for the reasons set out above, there is  no
    prospect of the child being  deprived  of  his  rights  under  EU  law.
    Further, we remind ourselves that in the cases referred to  above,  the
    CJEU was clearly aware of the impact  of  articles  7  and  24  of  the
    Charter.

50. We adopt the  5  stage  test  set  out  in  Razgar  which  mirrors  the
    jurisprudence of the ECtHR.   We accept that the first 4 steps are  met
    in the appellant's favour. We accept also that there is a  family  life
    between the appellant and her son; and, that they  have  private  lives
    here.

51. The starting  point  must  be  a  consideration  of  the  child's  best
    interests as set out in article 24 of the  Charter.  It  is  a  primary
    consideration as it is under domestic law.

52. Mr Pountney did not address us in any detail on this aspect of the case
    beyond asserting that it will be difficult for the child  to  relocate,
    that at present his best interests would be to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom rather than to relocate to the  Netherlands  given  that  there
    would be difficulty in him integrating at least in the short term  into
    a new schooling system, home and into a country with which  he  has  no
    familiarity and with which his mother has  no  familiarity.  There  is,
    however, insufficient detail as to current circumstances, and what  the
    situation would be in the Netherlands. Much of  the  difficulties  that
    are said to exist are matters of conjecture.

53. We bear in mind that the appellant and her  son  have  not  shown  they
    could not continue to live as a family unit in the Netherlands. Neither
    of them have the right to remain in the United Kingdom, under  domestic
    or EU law and weight must be attached to that fact. There is nothing in
    the jurisprudence of the ECtHR to suggest otherwise.

54. We accept that the child is now 6 and has started  school.  There  will
    inevitably be disruption to his life were he now to relocate, but he is
    still young.

55. These considerations are outweighed by the fact that  the  neither  the
    appellant nor her son has shown that he has the right to remain in  the
    United  Kingdom.  It  is  not  shown  that  they  cannot  live  in  the
    Netherlands, or that the change of  circumstances  of  which  there  is
    little evidence, only conjecture,  would  be  such  that  the  need  to
    maintain control of immigration, even of those who are EU citizens,  is
    outweighed.

56. Accordingly, for these reasons, we are not satisfied that the  decision
    breaches the United Kingdom's obligations under the EU Treaties and  we
    dismiss this appeal.

Notice of Decision

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and we set it aside.

57. We remake the decision by dismissing the appeal.
