                                                                  Respondent



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, a citizen of Turkey, born on the 6th June 1987,  appeals
    with permission against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge
    Pedro), who dismissed the Appellant's appeal against  the  decision  of
    the Respondent made on the 22nd February July 2012 to refuse her  entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom.

 2.   The Appellant made an application for entry clearance for  settlement
    with her fianc�, the sponsor, under Paragraph 352AA of the  Immigration
    Rules HC 395(as amended). The sponsor is a recognised  refugee,  having
    been granted status on the 18th August 2010.

 3. In a determination promulgated on 28th September 2012,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Pedro) dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules
    and on human rights grounds.

 4.  The Appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  that  decision.  In  the
    grounds for permission, it stated that it  had  been  conceded  in  the
    appeal that the Appellant could not succeed under  Paragraph  352AA  of
    the Rules nor could she succeed under paragraph 290 as the sponsor  was
    not settled in the UK as he only had limited leave to remain  but  that
    all  the  other  requirements  could   be   met,   including   adequate
    accommodation  and  maintenance,  (see  grounds  for   permissions   at
    paragraph 2). However, it  was  submitted  that  the  appeal  therefore
    proceeded on Article 8  grounds  with  reference  to  the  decision  of
    Aswatte (fianc� of refugees (Sri Lanka) [2011] UKUT 00476. No issue had
    been taken by either the ECO or the Presenting Officer at  the  hearing
    with regard to the sponsor's ability to  maintain  or  accommodate  the
    Appellant.  However, in  dismissing  the  appeal,  the  judge  was  not
    satisfied  that  the  Appellant  was  able  to  meet  the   maintenance
    requirement of paragraph 290. Thus it was submitted that  the  decision
    of the FtT  was  in  error  by  failing  to  put  the  sponsor  or  the
    representative on notice that this was an issue as  the  same  had  not
    been raised by the ECO or the Presenting Officer  and  that  is  was  a
    matter of procedural unfairness.  Thus the grounds raised the issues of
    whether the judger should have reached the decision on a material issue
    without giving the Appellant, through her sponsor  and  representative,
    the opportunity to deal with at issue.

 5. On 6th November 2012 permission to appeal  was  granted  by  the  First
    -tier Tribunal (Judge Sharp).

 6. The notice of decision for permission to appeal  was  served  upon  the
    parties and in addition directions were served to the filing of further
    evidence  in  respect  of  this  appeal.   At  paragraph  4  of   those
    directions, the parties were on notice that the  Upper  Tribunal  would
    consider all documentation received by it in response to the directions
    before deciding whether or not it is necessary to have an oral hearing.
     In respect of those directions, a response to the  Grounds  of  Appeal
    under Rule 24 was received on behalf of the  Secretary  of  State.   In
    that response at paragraph 2 it is stated that the Respondent  did  not
    oppose the Appellant's application for permission to appeal and invited
    the Tribunal to  "determine  the  appeal  with  a  fresh  oral  hearing
    (continuance) hearing to consider whether the Appellant is entitled  to
    entry clearance under Article 8. This is because maintenance was  taken
    as an important issue in the assessment and according  to  Judge  Sharp
    who has granted permissions there is  no  evidence  on  the  record  of
    proceedings that the sponsor was ever given an opportunity  to  address
    this matter which clearly concerned the judge. "

 7. In the light of the content of the grounds  for  permission  to  appeal
    which is  based  on  a  procedural  irregularity  which  gave  rise  to
    unfairness and the response to the Grounds of Appeal under Rule  24  in
    which it is conceded that the determination discloses an error of  law,
    both parties appeared to agree in effect that the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal could not stand.

 8. On the 13th January 2013, the Upper Tribunal issued directions  in  the
    following terms:

    "In the light of the  issues  raised  in  the  grounds,  the  grant  of
    permission  and  the  response  from  the  respondent  in   which   the
    application for permissions is not opposed, it is my  provisional  view
    that the decision of the  First tier Tribunal discloses an error of law
    in that there had been a  procedural irregularity before  the  FTT  and
    that the proper course would be to set aside  the  decision  and  remit
    this appeal to be heard by the First Tier Tribunal in  accordance  with
    Section 12(2)(b) of the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act  and
    Paragraph 7(2) of Practice Statement of 10th February 2010(as amended).

                       DIRECTIONS:

    Any submissions to the contrary are to be filed no later than  14  days
    after the date on which this direction is sent out."

 9.  No further submissions were filed in respect of those  directions.  It
    is not clear why there has been a delay  since  those  directions  were
    sent out. I have now been asked to  give  further  directions  for  the
    appeal. I consider it appropriate to decide whether an error of law has
    been established without a  hearing  under  Rule  34(1)  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal Procedure Rules.  For  the  reasons  given  in  the  grant  of
    permission (read with the grounds) and the response received  from  the
    Respondent, I conclude that the First tier Tribunal has made  an  error
    of law.   In those circumstances, the appropriate  course  is  for  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal to be set  aside.   The  Respondent
    invites the Tribunal to determine the appeal with a fresh oral hearing.
     In that context, I am satisfied that the appropriate course is for the
    appeal to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  there  to  be  an
    assessment for the evidence. Whilst it is not the ordinary practice  of
    the Tribunal to remit cases  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  there  are
    reasons why in this case such a course should be adopted, having  given
    particular regard to the overriding objective of the efficient disposal
    of appeals and that there are issues of fact that are central  to  this
    appeal that require  determination  which  have  not  been  taken  into
    account or assessed due to a procedural irregularity that occurred with
    the case before the First-tier Tribunal.  In that sense the case  falls
    within the practice statement of paragraph 7.2(a) and (b) (as amended).



10. Therefore the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside and  the
    case is to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Hatton Cross for a
    hearing in accordance with Section 12(2)(b) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts
    and Enforcement Act at paragraph 7.2 of the practice statement of  10th
    February 2010 (as amended).

Decision

The decision of the Immigration Judge is to be set  aside  and  remitted  to
the First-tier Tribunal for a hearing in accordance  with  Section  12(2)(b)
of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act and practice statement of  10th
February 2010 (as amended).




Signed                                  Date: 1st July 2013.
