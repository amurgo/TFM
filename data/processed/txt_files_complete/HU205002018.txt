                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Vietnam born in March  1993.  He  appeals
    against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  L   Shand   QC
    promulgated on 12 June 2019 dismissing his appeal against  the  refusal
    of leave to remain on human rights grounds.

2.   Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Gill  on  28
    August 2019 for the following reasons:-

         "It is arguable that Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  L  Shand  QC
         may have erred in law by failing to consider whether the  appellant
         satisfies EX.1(b) of Appendix FM.

         Para 7 of the grounds contends that the judge was mistaken when she
         said, at para 41 of her decision, that it was not contended on  the
         appellant's behalf that his family life claim could succeed if  she
         did not find that the appellant had a parental relationship with O.
          I agree that it is arguable that the judge may have misapprehended
         the appellant's case in this respect, given that  para  15  of  the
         skeleton argument that was before her  contended  that  there  were
         insurmountable obstacles to the Appellant and his  wife  continuing
         their family life together outside the UK."

3.   It was accepted at the outset of the hearing that the  judge  had  made
    an error of law in failing to consider and apply paragraph  EX.1(b)  of
    Appendix FM. Ms Mac submitted that I should remake the decision on  the
    facts found by the First-tier Tribunal. She submitted that  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  continuing  outside  the  UK
    because the Appellant's wife had shared custody of her 10 year old son.
    She invited me to allow the appeal.

4.   Mr Bramble submitted that there was insufficient evidence to show  that
    there would  be  unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  if  the  Appellant
    returned to Vietnam to obtain entry clearance.   The  Appellant's  wife
    could live without the Appellant in the UK with her son as she had done
    in the past. Ms Mac submitted that this was not a  requirement  of  the
    Immigration Rules, but in any event the Appellant's wife could not meet
    the financial requirements and therefore the  Appellant  would  not  be
    able to obtain entry clearance. Family life could not continue  outside
    the UK.



Conclusions and reasons

5.   The Appellant  entered  the  UK  clandestinely  in  2013  and  remained
    illegally. He met his wife in December 2015, and  they  started  living
    together in April 2017. On 27 November 2017 the Appellant  applied  for
    leave to remain on the basis of his family life with  his  partner  and
    her son. The Appellant married his partner in March 2018.  There was no
    challenge  to  the  finding  that  the  Appellant  did  not  meet   the
    requirements of EX.1(a). The judge  found  that  it  was  in  the  best
    interests of the child to remain in the UK with both  his  parents  and
    the Appellant had no parental relationship.

6.   At paragraph 41 of the decision the judge stated:-

         "I have also considered the appeal based on Article 8  outside  the
         Rules on the basis of the appellant's private life and  his  family
         life  with  his  wife,  although  it  was  not  submitted  on   the
         appellant's behalf that his appeal could succeed on either of these
         grounds if I did not find that he has a parental relationship  with
         O."

7.   I am of  the  view  that  the  judge  has  misunderstood  the  case  as
    presented by the Appellant. It appears from the  bundle  submitted  for
    the First-tier Tribunal hearing in April 2019 that  the  Appellant  did
    rely on paragraph EX.1(b) of Appendix FM and submitted that there  were
    insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  continuing  outside  the  UK
    because the Appellant's wife had shared custody for her son. There  was
    evidence in the Appellant's witness statement to support the contention
    that there were insurmountable obstacles. The skeleton argument drafted
    by counsel for the hearing, dated 9 April 2019, clearly  puts  this  in
    issue at paragraph 15.

8.   It is agreed that the judge has  erred  in  law  in  failing  to  apply
    paragraph EX.1.(b) of the Immigration Rules which states:-

         "EX.1.(b)      the  applicant  has   a   genuine   and   subsisting
                  relationship with a partner who is in  the  UK  and  is  a
                  British Citizen, settled in the  UK  or  in  the  UK  with
                  refugee leave or humanitarian protection,  and  there  are
                  insurmountable obstacles to family life with that  partner
                  continuing outside the UK."

         "EX.2.   For the purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  'insurmountable
                  obstacles' means the very significant  difficulties  which
                  would be faced  by  the  applicant  or  their  partner  in
                  continuing their family life together outside the  UK  and
                  which could not be overcome or would entail  very  serious
                  hardship for the applicant or their partner."

9.   I find that the judge erred in law in failing to  apply  this  relevant
    provision to the facts as she found them, and I set aside her  decision
    to dismiss the appeal on Article 8 grounds.

10.  I am not persuaded by Mr Bramble's submission that there  needs  to  be
    further evidence in this case, in particular  in  relation  to  whether
    there would be unjustifiably harsh consequences were the  Appellant  to
    return to Vietnam to obtain entry clearance.  I  find  this  is  not  a
    requirement of the test set out in EX.1(b) as clarified  by  EX.2.  The
    test is whether there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    continuing outside the UK.

11.  It is quite clear on the facts of this case  that  family  life  cannot
    continue outside the UK. The Appellant's wife is unable to relocate  to
    Vietnam because she has to remain in the UK to  care  for  her  British
    citizen child when he is not cared for by his father.  The  Appellant's
    wife has shared custody of her 10 year old  son,  O,  from  a  previous
    relationship. O lives with his mother and the Appellant for half of the
    week and lives with his biological father the other half of  the  week.
    This is set out in a child arrangement order dated  6  May  2016  which
    does not permit O to be taken out of the country without  his  father's
    written consent or leave of the Family Court.  The  court  order  makes
    clear the elements of this arrangement.

12.  The Appellant's wife cannot leave the UK to go and resettle in  Vietnam
    with the Appellant because of her British citizen child and the  shared
    custody arrangements. I find that there are insurmountable obstacles to
    family life continuing outside the UK.  It is not relevant whether  the
    Appellant can go out of the country to obtain entry  clearance  because
    that is not part of the test explained in EX.2. Such an argument  would
    only be relevant to an assessment of Article 8 outside the  Immigration
    Rules.

13.  Given that the Appellant satisfies the Immigration Rules, it  would  be
    disproportionate  to  remove  the  Appellant.  Further,  Mr   Bramble's
    argument on Article 8 could not succeed because the evidence before the
    First-tier Tribunal and before me is that the Appellant would be unable
    to obtain entry clearance to re-enter because his wife earns  �520  per
    month which is insufficient to satisfy the financial  requirement.  The
    Appellant's removal would split the family  permanently  and  therefore
    there would  be  unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  in  requiring  the
    Appellant to return to Vietnam and obtain entry clearance.

14.  Accordingly, I find that there are  insurmountable  obstacles  in  this
    case and the Appellant has satisfied paragraph EX.1(b) of Appendix  FM.
    His appeal is allowed under the Immigration  Rules  and  on  Article  8
    grounds.
