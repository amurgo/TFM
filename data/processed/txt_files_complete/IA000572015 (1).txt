                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. [HK] is a citizen of India born on [ ] 1985.  I will refer  to  her  as
    "the Applicant".  She came to the United Kingdom on 6th April 2007 with
    a visa as a spouse valid until the 3rd April 2009.   She  submitted  an
    application for further leave to remain as a spouse on 5th  July  2011.
    That was refused but she was granted discretionary leave to  remain  on
    the basis of her marriage.  On 28th August 2014 application was made on
    her behalf for indefinite leave to  remain  as  a  victim  of  domestic
    violence and she also applied for leave  to  remain  on  the  basis  of
    family and private life.  These were refused and  she  made  a  further
    application for leave to remain on the  basis  of  family  and  private
    life.  The applications were refused and a decision made to remove  her
    to India.

 2. The Applicant's appeal against refusal to vary her  leave  and  removal
    was heard before First-tier Tribunal Judge Phull on 22nd July 2015.  In
    a decision promulgated on 13th August 2015  the  appeal  was  dismissed
    under the Immigration Rules but allowed  under  Article  8  ECHR.   The
    Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal  to  this  Tribunal
    against the judge's decision.

 3. In the grounds it was said that the judge  had  not  provided  adequate
    explanation as to why Article 8 was breached.  The judge  had  accepted
    that there was domestic abuse but acknowledged that the Applicant could
    not succeed under the Immigration Rules.  The judge then considered the
    impact upon the children of a relative should the Applicant be  removed
    to India.  The judge stated that the issue had not been dealt  with  by
    the Secretary of State although it would not have formed  part  of  any
    general consideration but  only  featured  in  the  balancing  exercise
    regarding Article 8 which the judge could have considered.   There  was
    no explanation, it was said, as to why  the  lack  of  the  Applicant's
    presence in the UK would breach  her  rights  under  the  Human  Rights
    Convention or those of the children.  The judge found that it would  be
    disproportionate to remove the Applicant because of domestic  abuse  to
    which she was no longer subject and a relationship  with  a  relative's
    children but had not explained what the result of the removal might be.
     She had found that there was  not  anything  in  the  public  interest
    warranting removal of the Applicant but effective immigration  controls
    were of public interest and there was nothing exceptional in  the  case
    that would warrant visiting the Human  Rights  Convention.   Permission
    was granted.

 4. The Applicant's representatives put in a detailed response under  Upper
    Tribunal Procedure Rule 24 arguing that there was no material error  of
    law in the judge's decision.  The judge had found that there was family
    life and that the Applicant  cared  for  the  cousin's  children.   The
    existence of family life was a matter of fact. There was  a  degree  of
    dependency between the Applicant and her cousin and the  Applicant  had
    been ostracised by her family in India.  The cousin's British  children
    enjoyed family life with the Applicant and would be adversely  affected
    if she were removed.  Finally it was said that the judge had found that
    the application for  settlement  under  the  Rules  could  not  succeed
    because  the  Applicant  had  been  granted  discretionary  leave   and
    therefore could not satisfy the requirements of  the  Rules  to  obtain
    indefinite leave to remain on the grounds of domestic violence but  the
    judge  did  find  that  the  marriage  had  broken  down   during   the
    probationary  period  and  the  Immigration  Rules  do   not   preclude
    overstayers from applying for  indefinite  leave.   The  Applicant  had
    applied in the correct manner and the only reason she could not succeed
    under the Rules was because she had been granted discretionary leave to
    remain.   These  factors,  it  was  said,  were  all  relevant  to  the
    proportionality assessment.

 5. At the hearing before me Mr Mills addressed me first.  He said that the
    application could not have been allowed under the Rules  and  had  been
    allowed under Article 8.  There was a reference to the marriage  having
    broken down during the probationary  period  but  it  had  broken  down
    during a period of discretionary  leave  and  therefore  the  Applicant
    could not meet the requirements of  the  Rules.   The  judge  found  at
    paragraph 32 of her decision that  there  was  nothing  in  the  public
    interest to deflect from the fact that the Applicant was  a  woman  who
    had suffered domestic violence.  Mr Mills submitted  that  this  was  a
    classic example of sympathy by a judge for an Applicant  and  a  belief
    that Article 8 was a general dispensing power.  But the  Supreme  Court
    had disapproved of such an approach in cases such as Patel and others v
    SSHD [2013] UKSC 72.  He said that the purpose of the domestic violence
    concession and subsequent rule was so that an abusive  British  sponsor
    should not use an Applicant's immigration status as a lever in order to
    abuse.  That was why the rule was specific.  If the requirements of the
    Rules were met ILR was  granted  and  that  was  a  route  out  of  the
    violence.  He submitted that this was not the  case  with  the  current
    matter.  Parliament  had  decided  where  the  balance  of  the  public
    interest fell.  The  judge  appeared  to  think  that  any  finding  of
    domestic violence would lead to a right to remain but that was not  the
    case.  If there was a risk on return  the  Applicant  could  apply  for
    asylum.

 6. He continued that the finding  that  the  Appellant  was  a  victim  of
    domestic violence was arguably perverse.  It was  based  on  the  judge
    excluding a police report which the  judge  had  assessed  selectively.
    The  inference   (at   paragraph   15)   was   that   the   Applicant's
    representatives had been unable to obtain the full report  because  the
    former husband's family worked with the police.  The judge acknowledged
    she had the report but said that she was ignoring  it  because  it  had
    been redacted.  She did not give a basis on which she  said  she  could
    not rely upon it.  Even  if  her  view  was  not  perverse  but  merely
    generous she had not demonstrated how the  requirements  of  Article  8
    were met.  The Applicant did not meet the requirements of the Rules and
    the judge appeared to think the fact that she had "suffered enough" was
    an adequate explanation.

 7. He continued that the judge found that there was  family  life  with  a
    cousin but the hearing had only taken place in the middle of  2015  and
    the Applicant had lived with her cousin for a little over a  year.   At
    paragraph 26 the judge found that  the  interests  of  the  cousin  and
    children were relevant.  With regard to the welfare of the children she
    found that the decision under appeal was not in accordance with the law
    as  the  best  interests  of  the  children  had  not  been  adequately
    considered.  It was not clear that it  was  ever  argued  that  it  was
    against the interests of  the  children  if  the  Applicant,  a  second
    cousin, were removed.  He said the interests of the children were fully
    served by living with their own parents and  the  suggestion  that  the
    interests of the children should  be  considered  without  evidence  of
    significance was not tenable.  To add to the error the judge found that
    the decision was not in accordance with the law due  to  a  failure  to
    consider the best interests of the children, in which case  she  should
    not have gone on to consider proportionality.  She had never considered
    the best interests of the children herself and had  not  explained  how
    significant they were in the balance.  The Applicant  had  been  living
    with her cousin but had been working herself.  There was no evidence of
    dependency and nowhere was there consideration of  whether  there  were
    compelling  factors  outside  the  Rules  requiring  Article  8  to  be
    considered.

 8. Finally Mr Mills said that the judge had not  considered  in  substance
    Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   She
    commented at paragraph 24 that she had had regard to  the  Section  but
    she had not actually addressed  it.   Section  117B(5)  indicated  that
    little  weight  should  be  given  to  private  life  where  leave  was
    precarious.  The judge had not considered that.  It had  come  down  to
    the judge having sympathy for  the  Applicant  and  thinking  that  she
    deserved to stay but that was not sufficient.

 9. In reply Miss Norman referred to the Rule  24  response  on  which  she
    relied.  She said the starting point  was  that  the  judge  found  the
    witnesses to be credible.  She said it was na�ve to  suggest  that  the
    judge should have relied on the police report when it had been redacted
    and there had been no explanation for that redaction.  She  said  there
    was ample evidence of domestic violence and  the  marriage  had  broken
    down during the probationary period.  It was  the  violence  which  had
    prevented the Applicant from making a further application in time.  The
    test under the Rules was  whether  the  relationship  had  broken  down
    during the probationary period and the judge had accepted that it  did.
    She found that the Applicant had not been able to make the  application
    earlier.  If she had done so, on the judge's findings, she  would  have
    been granted ILR.  The state could not have acted as it would have done
    because of the nature of the domestic violence.  The  effect  was  that
    the Applicant was vulnerable, would be ostracised in  India  and  could
    not return to her family.

10. She continued by saying that with regard  to  Article  8  the  coercive
    control demonstrated was not in the public interest.  It was  suggested
    that it had not been shown that  there  was  family  life  but  as  was
    apparent from the Rule 24 response family life covered a diverse  range
    of relationships.  The judge had explained this,  she  submitted.   She
    was involved in the family of the cousin and her children.  They looked
    after each other.  There was an emotional dependency.   The  judge  had
    been entitled to find that  and  to  say  that  the  interests  of  the
    children would be harmed if the Applicant had to leave With  regard  to
    the Rules there  was  no  precluding  of  an  overstayer  applying  for
    indefinite leave  to  remain  yet  the  grant  of  discretionary  leave
    prevented it.

11. As to Section 117B of the Rules Miss Norman said  that  the  judge  had
    considered that section but she did not have to consider each and every
    step.  Finally Mr Mills said in response  that  there  was  a  lack  of
    reasoning as to why family life was engaged.  If the matter turned only
    on private life little weight could  be  given  to  it.   The  ultimate
    reasoning was simply that  the  Applicant  was  a  victim  of  domestic
    violence.

12. Having considered those submissions I reserved my decision which I  now
    give.  The judge clearly felt great sympathy for this  Applicant.   She
    heard evidence from the Applicant and her cousins and found that  there
    had been domestic violence.  She did however accept that the  Applicant
    could not meet the requirements of the Rules and in addressing  matters
    under paragraph 276ADE (at paragraph 21 of her decision) she found that
    the Applicant had not explained what significant obstacles there  might
    be for her integration into India should she be required to  leave  the
    UK.  Whilst the judge believed that the Applicant would  be  ostracised
    by her own family the fact that she had not shown that she  would  face
    significant obstacles were she to return  was  not  factored  into  the
    balancing exercise under Article 8.

13. The judge addressed the question of the existence of private and family
    life at paragraph 25 of her decision.  She noted that the Applicant was
    in a relationship with her cousins with whom she had been living  since
    February 2014 and that she helped to care for the cousin's children, to
    take care of the cousin when she was unwell and they were  close.   The
    judge went on to find that this established that there was family  life
    within the terms of Article 8.  As was  pointed  out  in  the  Rule  24
    response the existence of family life  for  Article  8  purposes  is  a
    question of fact but it  needs  to  be  explained  why  a  relationship
    between adults and the children of relatives does amount to family life
    for these purposes.  There appears to have been no financial dependency
    as the Applicant was working, at one point  in  the  convenience  store
    owned by her former in-laws and subsequently as a  care  assistant.   I
    find that the judge in this instance has  not  explained  according  to
    criteria in cases such as Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ  31  how  the
    connection amounted to family life for the purposes of Article  8.   It
    may be that there is family life between  adults  but  the  element  of
    dependency establishing that family life needs to be expressed.

14. I found there was force in the submission that if the judge found  that
    the decision was not in accordance with the law by virtue of failure to
    consider the best interests  of  the  cousin's  children  then  it  was
    inappropriate to go on to consider proportionality.  On  the  basis  of
    the information which was before the Secretary  of  State  the  judge's
    finding in that regard does not  however  appear  to  have  been  well-
    founded as the Secretary of State did consider the  best  interests  of
    the children at paragraph 30 of the refusal letter.

15. With regard to proportionality the question whether there  was  or  was
    not family life was of core importance bearing in mind Section 117B  of
    the 2002 Act.  Whilst the judge referred to Section 117B  she  did  not
    address  the  relevant  sub-paragraphs  in  reaching  her  decision  on
    proportionality.  It is clear from cases such as Dube (ss117A - ss117D)
    [2015] UKUT 00090 (IAC) and Bossade (ss117A  -  D  -  interrelationship
    with Rules) [2015] UKUT 415 that she should have done so, at  least  in
    substance.  Miss Norman submitted that the judge had in fact  performed
    this  exercise  but  she  did  not  for  instance  mention  that  under
    subsection (5) of Section 117B little weight should be given to private
    life established when a  person's  immigration  status  is  precarious.
    That was clearly relevant to the weight to be given to the  Applicant's
    private life.  I have therefore come to the conclusion that there  were
    material errors of law in the judge's decision,  which  should  be  set
    aside.  I  did  raise  with  the  representatives  what  would  be  the
    appropriate course were I to reach this finding and  they  both  agreed
    that the appeal should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a new
    hearing in accordance with Practice Statement of  the  Immigration  and
    Asylum Chamber of the Upper Tribunal 7.2 and under  the  provisions  of
    Section 12(2)(b)(i) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

Decisions

The making of the decision by the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of a material error of law and that decision is set aside.   The  appeal  is
remitted for rehearing in accordance with the directions below.

There was no application for an anonymity order and none is made.

The fee award made by the First-tier Tribunal  necessarily  falls  with  the
setting aside of the decision of that Tribunal.
