Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms S Vidyadharan, Senior Presenting Officer
For the respondent:    Mr Keith Haywood of Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department and the
    respondent is a citizen of Sierra Leone born on [ ~ ]  1977.   However,
    for convenience, I refer below to Mr [A] as the appellant  and  to  the
    Secretary of State as the respondent, which are the  designations  they
    had before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Secretary of State appeals with permission to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge PGS White promulgated
    on 5 July 2018, allowing the appellant's appeal pursuant to  Article  3
    against the decision of the Secretary of State in which he refused  the
    appellant's claim for asylum and humanitarian protection in the  United
    Kingdom.

    The First-tier Tribunal Judge's findings

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge gave the following reasons for  allowing  the
    appellant's appeal pursuant to Article 3.

       i. The six reports and assessments prepared by Prof Katona  in  2014
          have been given consideration. The appellant was detained in this
          country following his arrest in  January  2012  and  he  remained
          detained  under  criminal  investigation  and  under  immigration
          powers until September 2013 of which for 3 � months he was  in  a
          psychiatric hospital. He subsequently brought a claim through his
          litigation friend for damages for  false  imprisonment.  In  late
          2016 his claim was settled with an agreed amount of  �100,000  to
          be paid to the appellant as damages. Given the appellant's mental
          health and ability to manage the sum of money, it was agreed that
          the sum be held in trust for the appellant by the  solicitor  who
          had acted in those proceedings.




      ii. The appellant  suffers  from  schizophrenia,  and  illness  of  a
          fluctuating nature. He has  a  significant  degree  of  cognitive
          impairment, and is a  significant  contributor  to  his  learning
          disability and is a potential contributor. He was  most  recently
          assessed as significantly depressed. Prof  Madden  believed  that
          there was limited scope for nonpharmacological components of care
          because the appellant's mental state has responded only partially
          to medication and remains grossly impaired.  His  decision-making
          capacity is likely to have fluctuated but  on  a  "good  day"  he
          might have or have had capacity to instruct  his  solicitors  for
          his immigration case. He has already suffered severe  psychiatric
          damage prior to his immigration detention which  was  exacerbated
          by him not taking his medication during two periods of detention.


     iii. The joint expert reports focuses on  the  appellant's  claim  for
          damages, but it  does  not  address  the  possible  risk  to  the
          appellant on  return  to  Sierra  Leone.  Prof  Katona's  earlier
          reports had  expressed  the  view  about  other  aspects  of  the
          appellant's prognosis, and at Prof Madden at paragraphs 211 - 221
          of the report she commented on some of this. She agreed that  the
          appellant's mental health is likely to  deteriorate  without  the
          support he receives from his half-brother and the  mental  health
          team in this country.


      iv. The most recent evidence of the appellant's condition comes  from
          a further report of Prof Katona dated 16 April  2018.  It  turned
          out when the appellant refused to attend an appointment with Prof
          Katona and had refused his medication for three  months  and  his
          condition had deteriorated. One symptom of this deterioration  is
          a complete neglect of personal hygiene. This failure was not life-
          threatening because of the support of his  half-brother  and  his
          mental health team.


       v.  The  medical  evidence  presents  a  broadly  a  consistent  and
          uncontroversial position. The appellant suffers from a  disabling
          mental illness and has  done  so  for  many  years.  Although  it
          fluctuates as severe and even at its best even below the level of
          mental  health  and  functioning.  Without  his  medication   the
          appellant's condition is likely and rapidly to deteriorate, given
          his lack of insight, and indeed failing or  refusing  medication,
          he needs external help and support to avoid  such  deterioration.
          The appellant suffers from apathy, which means that even  if  his
          condition remained stable he needs  help  to  support  his  basic
          needs. There is force to the observation that his recent  serious
          relapse, after a lengthy period (when his damages claim settled),
          makes it inherently less likely that his  condition  will  remain
          stable.


      vi. In the past the appellant has had auditory hallucinations  urging
          suicide. There is no evidence that suicide has  in  fact  been  a
          real risk in the past and it is now nearly 11 years since he  was
          diagnosed and therefore his present risk is low. Therefore, he is
          not at risk of suicide on return but that is not  the  only  risk
          alleged.


     vii. More than 700,000 people have had severe mental  health  problems
          in Sierra Leone needing medical treatment. There is evidence from
          a psychiatric nurse, from Kissy Mental Hospital  that  there  are
          psychiatric  patients  roaming  the  streets,  but  nobody  cares
          because they are insufficient drugs in the  hospital.  The  Judge
          was not persuaded that the treatment that the appellant  requires
          would be available to him in Sierra Leone.


    viii. Consideration has been given  to  Dr  Hopwood's  report  who  has
          worked  in  mental  health  care  in  Sierra  Leone.  The  report
          indicates that there are  three  psychiatrists  who  are  halfway
          through their training and have to go abroad for three  years  to
          complete it. There is one hospital for psychiatric inpatients  in
          Freetown. Staffing levels are a problem. Patients  see  a  doctor
          once a week and will spend most of the time in bed. Around 80% of
          patients are chained to their beds. This policy of being  chained
          was initially  supposed  to  only  apply  to  patients  who  were
          aggressive, but there was no way of monitoring whether they  were
          properly so categorised. When patient's behaviour is  problematic
          they may be beaten. Discharge from hospital is dependent  on  the
          availability of care either from family,  or  possibly  from  the
          community, and without it, patients  may  stay  in  hospital  for
          years. Although the hospital has  capacity  of  250  patients  in
          practice there are only slightly over  100.  Generally,  patients
          need family to pay for admission and supply  patients  with  food
          and essentials while in hospital, otherwise they may  be  refused
          admission, or if they stop paying, they may be discharged. It  is
          entirely clear the possibility of early discharge  from  lack  of
          family funding and support links. There  is  the  possibility  of
          being detained for years because of a lack of family  support  on
          discharge.




      ix. Apart from Hospital in Freetown  there  are  14  district  mental
          health units covering almost every district in the  country.  The
          total staff of these 14 units are 17 people. They see  perhaps  2
          to 4 patients per month  and  have  little  or  no  capacity  for
          assertive outreach, the  proactive  approach  mentioned  by  Prof
          Madden. Patients who do not actively seek and engage in treatment
          will not get it.


       x. There are also issues in hospital units over medication. There is
          no reliable source of antipsychotic medication, particularly  the
          long acting  intramuscular  injections  the  appellant  currently
          receives, and often medication which  are  available  expired  or
          sometimes counterfeit.


      xi. It was also observed by Dr Hopwood that people with mental health
          issues are heavily stigmatised. Families  may  refuse  to  accept
          back a member with mental health issues and can  be  beaten.  The
          police will not offer any protection, but it was suggested by  Dr
          Hopwood that they were joining in the beatings. Where people  are
          perceived as having mental health problems and needing  treatment
          that treatment is likely to be traditional and religious healing,
          such treatment  may  vary  from  actions  which  simply  have  no
          positive effect to treatments which may actively cause harm.


     xii. Dr Hopwood next reference, both in general terms  in  her  report
          and more specifically in the conclusions about what may happen to
          the appellant due to his lack of family support in Sierra  Leone.
          There are problems arising from the need to pay for treatment for
          medication and for food when in hospital and sometimes for to the
          need to pay bribes in order to receive treatment at all, at rates
          clearly beyond the reach of someone earning the average  wage  in
          Sierra Leone.


    xiii. In Prof Katona's report, she does not appear to  comment  on  the
          fact that the appellant would not necessarily be dependent on the
          typical wage in Sierra Leone because he has a fund of a  �100,000
          to support him.  I  appreciate  that  there  may  be  significant
          practical difficulties in his trustee ensuring that the money  is
          safely dispersed in Sierra Leone  for  the  appellant's  benefit,
          rather than being sent out and either wasted  by  him  or  stolen
          from him. One thing which might be possible would be to arrange a
          supply from abroad of appropriate medication  but  ensuring  that
          the appellant took it might be another matter.


     xiv. The refusal letter records  that  the  appellant  has  a  mother,
          sister and half-brother in Sierra Leone presumably on  the  basis
          of details given by him in his initial claim.  The  Judge  stated
          that he has no direct evidence either way. He did  not  think  he
          can simply assume as Dr Hopwood does that he will  be  unable  to
          make contact with them; said  "I  simply  do  not  know".  Again,
          whether the fact of his mental illness will cause them or  refuse
          to help the appellant is a separate question.




      xv. The WHO report of mental illness which was referred by Dr Hopwood
          has been considered. This report dates from  2012  but  certainly
          confirms as of that date the picture provided by Dr Hopwood  more
          recently and makes reference to  the  general  stigmatisation  of
          mental illness. It includes a list  of  psychotropic  medications
          regarded by WHO as essential medicines for mental disorders, none
          of which were then available government health facilities.


     xvi. The mentally ill  in  Sierra  Leone  are  viewed  by  society  as
          different from  and  inferior  to  the  majority  and  they  face
          discrimination, stigma, and  sometimes  worse,  because  of  that
          illness. Mental illness is an innate  characteristic  which  they
          cannot change if it is not curable. The Judge concluded that  the
          mentally ill people in Sierra  Leone  form  a  particular  social
          group for the purposes of the Refugee Convention.




    xvii. The Judge found that the appellant is liable to be  subjected  to
          traditional forms of treatment, which will vary from the harmless
          to the actively harmful.  They  are  undoubtedly  at  some  risk,
          although it is  difficult  to  estimate  how  serious,  of  being
          chained  and  beaten  by  their  families  or  by   their   local
          communities.  They  are  unlikely  to  find  work,   which   will
          inevitably  impact  on  their  ability  to   support   or   house
          themselves, and some certainly may be  at  risk  of  destitution.
          There are likely not to be able to access appropriate  treatment.
          For the very few  who  can  be  treated  at  the  country's  only
          psychiatric hospital they are at high risk of  being  chained  to
          their beds. The Judge found that such ill-treatment can  properly
          be characterised as inhuman and degrading, and as persecution.


   xviii. The appellant will  cease  to  receive  the  treatment  which  he
          currently needs and receives in this country.  He  will,  on  the
          medical evidence, lack the capacity to get it for himself and the
          overstretched facilities there will  not  have  the  capacity  to
          reach out to him. The medication he needs  is  not  in  fact  not
          available, and while it is possible that his money could be  used
          to arrange a supply from this country seems to be  overwhelmingly
          improbable that he will in practice be able to take advantage  of
          such a supply: he will  need,  as  he  does  here,  some  medical
          facility to receive the drugs and administer it  and  whether  he
          will have any support from relatives is unclear, and on one  view
          the absence is something he has not proved, but in  this  country
          even the existence  of  support  from  his  half-brother  is  not
          sufficient. In the absence of  medical  treatment  his  condition
          will rapidly deteriorate. Although the appellant's  condition  is
          in itself not  life-threatening  or  there  is  a  real  risk  of
          suicide,  but  his  history  in  this   country   suggests   that
          deterioration will not only increase the frequency and  force  of
          his former auditory hallucinations,  it  will  also  lead  to  an
          inability to care  for  himself  in  any  way,  and  to  erratic,
          aggressive and potentially criminal behaviour.




     xix. One consequence of suffering from untreated or untreatable mental
          illness in Sierra Leone is plainly a risk  of  being  reduced  to
          destitution. The appellant has available  to  him  �100,000  this
          country but from the evidence it  is  clear  that  he  lacks  the
          capacity to manage his  money  or  use  the  money  for  his  own
          benefit.


      xx. The Judge concluded that there is a real risk that the  appellant
          will be subject to ill-treatment which amounts to persecution  by
          reason of his membership to a  particular  social  group  of  the
          mentally ill in Sierra Leone and his claim for asylum succeeds as
          does his claim under Article 3, paragraph 276 ADE and  Article  8
          grounds.

    Grounds of appeal

 4. The respondent's grounds of appeal which I summarise are the following.
    It is not contested that  the  appellant  suffers  from  mental  health
    problems, namely schizophrenia and it is accepted that this is a  long-
    term condition for which  he  is  receiving  treatment  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 5. The Judge found that the Convention reason was that the  appellant  had
    an immutable  characteristic.  Mental  health  problems  cannot  be  an
    immutable characteristic. The fact that treatment mitigates and changes
    the manifestations of the  condition  means  the  condition  cannot  be
    immutable. It is therefore outside the scope of the Refugee Convention.

 6. This case therefore can only come within the scope of the Human  Rights
    Convention. In this case the key issue is the availability of treatment
    for the appellant Sierra  Leone.  The  appellant  provided  significant
    objective  evidence  to  show  that  current  treatment   is   severely
    restricted Sierra Leone. However,  the  appellant  is  in  the  unusual
    position of having �100,000 available to him. By Sierra Leone standards
    this is the average earnings of two decades of income. While  treatment
    in Sierra Leone may be restricted, it is  questionable  that  treatment
    may be available for someone with significant resources.

 7.  Furthermore,  it  is  not  clear  why  the  appellant  United  Kingdom
    representatives have not explained why  they  cannot  setup  some  care
    programme  scheme  under  Sierra  Leone  equivalent  of  the  power  of
    attorney. In such cases it is hard to conceive that this  is  not  some
    form of adequate treatment available and it is therefore submitted that
    the Tribunal erred in allowing this appeal.

    The hearing

 8. At the hearing both parties make submissions whether there is an  error
    of law.

    Findings as to whether there is an error of law

 9. There was no dispute that the  appellant  suffers  from  mental  health
    problems and is being treated in the United Kingdom with medication and
    other interventions as required by his medical team. There was also  no
    dispute that the appellant has �100,000 which was  awarded  to  him  in
    damages for unlawful imprisonment in this country. There can also be no
    dispute that this would translate into two decades or  more  of  income
    for an average person in Sierra Leone as evidenced  by  the  background
    evidence. There is therefore a substantial amount of  money  by  Sierra
    Leone standards available to the appellant on his return.

10. The Judge found that the appellant belongs to a particular social group
    for the purposes of the Refugee Convention as a mentally ill person  in
    Sierra Leone. He stated that mental illness  of  the  appellant  is  an
    innate characteristic, and the case of those  who  are  incurable,  one
    they cannot change. Given that  treatment  mitigates  and  changes  the
    manifestations of the condition means  that  the  condition  cannot  be
    immutable. The evidence was that the appellant has gone  through  lucid
    moments as he has been able  to  instruct  lawyers  for  his  case  for
    unlawful imprisonment by  the  respondent  for  which  he  was  awarded
    �100,000 damages. The Judge noted that "his decision-making capacity is
    likely to have fluctuated but on a "good day" he might have or have had
    capacity to instruct his solicitors for his immigration case.

11. The Judge materially erred by finding that the appellant is a member of
    a particular social group and by allowing his appeal under the  Refugee
    Convention.

12. The Regulations.  The  Refugee  or  Person  in  Need  of  International
    Protection (Qualification) Regulations 2006. Regulation 6 states:

       (1) In deciding whether a person is a refugee....
      (d) a group shall be considered to  form  a  particular  social  group
      where, for example:
      (i) members of that group share an innate characteristic, or a  common
      background that cannot be changed, or share a characteristic or belief
      that is so fundamental to identity or conscience that a person  should
      not be forced to renounce it, and
      (ii) that group has a  distinct  identity  in  the  relevant  country,
      because it is perceived as being different by the surrounding society;


      (e) a particular social group might include a group based on a  common
      characteristic of sexual orientation but sexual orientation cannot  be
      understood to include acts considered to  be  criminal  in  accordance
      with national law of the United Kingdom;

13. In Minister voor Immigratie en Aisel  v X, Y  and  Z  C-199/12  and  C-
    201/12 CFEU Fourth Chamber it  was  held  that  the  definition  of  "a
    particular  social  group"  in  Article  10(1)  of  the   Qualification
    Directive required that two conditions were met. First, members of such
    a group had to share an innate characteristic or belief, so fundamental
    to identity or conscience that they should not be  forced  to  renounce
    it. Secondly, it was necessary for the  group  to  possess  a  distinct
    identity in the relevant country  because  members  were  perceived  as
    different by the surrounding society.


14. In SSHD v K and Fornah v SSHD 2006  UKHL  46  and  IAS  16.11.06   Lord
    Bingham derived the following principles from  the  legal  authorities,
    including the Qualification Directive. (1) The Refugee  Convention  was
    not concerned with all cases of discrimination, only  with  persecution
    based on discrimination, the making of distinctions which principles of
    fundamental human rights regarded as inconsistent  with  the  right  of
    every human being. (2) To identify a social group the society of  which
    it formed part had to first be identified; a  particular  social  group
    might be recognisable as such in one country but not in another. (3)  A
    social group need not be cohesive to be recognised as such.  (4)  There
    could only be a particular social group if it existed independently  of
    the persecution to which it was subject.

15. Lord Bingham indicated that a particular social  group  may  be  formed
    either because its members  share  a  characteristic  which  cannot  or
    should not be  changed  (the  protected  characteristics  approach)  or
    because they are  perceived  as  having  a  distinct  identity  by  the
    surrounding society (the social  perception  approach).   Lord  Bingham
    noted EU Council Directive 2004/83/EC Article 10(d) (i) and (ii)  which
    are effectively reproduced at Regulation  6(d)  (i)  and  (ii)  of  the
    Qualification Regs but said that  if  (i)  and  (ii)  both  had  to  be
    satisfied then the test in the Regulations was more stringent than  was
    warranted by international authorities. He said that the  Qualification
    Directive should not be read as requiring both features to  be  present
    in order for there to be a social group for the purposes of the Refugee
    Convention.  Either will do.  It appears therefore that  this  decision
    goes beyond what the HL said in Shah and Islam.

16. Lord Rodger of Earlsferry (in SSHD v K and Fornah v  SSHD)  adopted  an
    Australian proposition that, while it is not  necessary  that  all  the
    members of a social group be persecuted before one can say that  people
    are being persecuted for reasons of their membership of that group,  it
    is generally necessary that all the members  of  the  group  should  be
    susceptible to persecution. It was also said that  that  there  was  no
    requirement that the persecution be carried out by persons who were not
    members of the social group.

17. In Shah and Islam and Others v SSHD HL (1999) INLR 144  Steyn  LJ  said
    that "A particular social group consisted of a  group  of  persons  who
    share a common immutable characteristic  that  either  was  beyond  the
    power  of  an  individual  to  change  or  was  so  fundamental  to  an
    individual's identity or conscience that it ought not to be required to
    be changed".  The existence of such  a  group  did  not  depend  on  an
    element of cohesiveness, co-operation or interdependence amongst  group
    members, but the group must exist  independently  of  the  persecution.
    Hoffman LJ said that "It is a fallacy to  say  that,  because  not  all
    members  of  a  class  are  being  persecuted,  that  it  follows  that
    persecution of a few cannot be on grounds of membership of that class".
     Hope LJ said that the word "social" means that we are being  asked  to
    identify a group that is recognised as a particular  group  by  society
    and as social customs and attitudes differ  from  one  country  to  the
    next, the context of enquiry has  to  be  the  applicant's  country  of
    nationality.  He pointed out that  discrimination  may  set  the  group
    apart and the concept of discrimination does  not  offend  against  the
    rule that the group must exist  independently  of  persecution  because
    people can be discriminated against without being persecuted.

18. The Judge did not consider all the jurisprudence  set  out  above  when
    deciding whether the appellant is a member  of  the  particular  social
    group and had he done so he might have come to a different  conclusion.
    I find that there was not  sufficient  evidence  before  the  Judge  to
    conclude that mentally ill people in Sierra  Leone  form  a  particular
    social group.

19. The Judge considered the position of the appellant  on  his  return  to
    Sierra Leone and came to  the  conclusion  after  taking  into  account
    objective evidence and reports by experts that there  is  insufficiency
    of medical treatment for mental illness in Sierra Leone.  However,  the
    expert reports and the objective evidence does not say that there is no
    medical treatment available but that it is not sufficient for  everyone
    and the conditions under which mental patients are held are  considered
    inhumane as there is a possibility that they are chained to their  beds
    if deemed to be aggressive.

20. The objective evidence suggests that if a person has resources, medical
    attention is available  although  it  is  not  to  the  high  standards
    available in this country. Objective evidence also suggests that  there
    are many cases of mentally ill persons in Sierra Leone  and  those  who
    are disfranchised without financial and family support  face  hardship.
    The Judge noted that Prof Katona does not take into  account  that  the
    appellant has available to him �100,000 on his  return  in  his  expert
    report.

21. The Judge said he does not know whether the appellant  has  family  who
    can assist  him  in  Sierra  Leone.  The  respondent  stated  that  the
    appellant when he made his claim for asylum indicated that he  has  his
    mother, sister and half-brother in Sierra Leone. Despite this evidence,
    the Judge found that he does not know whether the appellant has  family
    in Sierra Leone. The  appellant's  evidence  at  his  asylum  interview
    clearly was that he has family Sierra Leone including his mother. There
    was no evidence upon which the Judge  could  have  concluded  that  the
    appellant does not have family but instead  stated  that  he  does  not
    know. As the appellant has stated that he has family  Sierra  Leone  at
    his asylum claim, there was no reason for the Judge to say that he does
    not know.

22. The Judge did not properly assess that evidence including the fact that
    the appellant has �100,000 available to him which  would  make  him  an
    attractive proposition for his family who will  have  an  incentive  to
    look after him. Prof Katona in her report did not refer to the  sum  of
    money available to the appellant in her expert report and whether  that
    would make a difference to the care that the  appellant  will  receive.
    The Judge failed to consider that  the  level  of  financial  resources
    available to the  appellant  would  go  a  long  way  in  ensuring  the
    appellant's proper care. Background evidence also makes it  clear  that
    those who have money are able to get treatment.

23. The Judge noted  that  Prof  Madden  in  her  report  stated  that  the
    appellant" might sometimes exaggerate his symptoms, as it is common for
    this condition, they were in any event the severe end of the spectrum".
    The Judge did not consider that the appellant who was able to  instruct
    lawyers for his suit for damages, will be able to with the help of  the
    family to receive adequate treatment even if it is not to the standards
    of this country.

24. Therefore, the objective  evidence  does  not  say  that  there  is  no
    treatment available but states that it is not available  to  everybody.
    However objective evidence makes clear that if a  mentally  ill  person
    has family and financial resources,  he  has  the  ability  to  receive
    mental health treatment.

25. In HM (Mental Health) Sierra Leone CG [2002] UKIAT 04459 the  appellant
    had been a victim of  rape.   Her  father  and  her  husband  had  been
    murdered.  She  suffered  from  depression  and  post-traumatic  stress
    disorder. The doctor recommended anti-depressants and counselling,  the
    latter over a period of 12 months.  There was evidence  concerning  the
    availability of mental healthcare in Freetown. It  was  said  that  the
    Kissy Mental Hospital in  Freetown  was  the  only  hospital  providing
    mental health care in Sierra Leone and it was said to be managed by the
    only Sierra Leonian psychiatrist in  the  country.  However,  a  report
    entitled War Related Sexual Violence in Sierra Leone by Physicians  for
    Human Rights referred to anecdotal evidence  suggesting  that  existing
    psychosocial services, provided almost exclusively by NGOs, was proving
    to be very valuable inside IDP camps in larger towns such  as  Freetown
    and  Kenema.  It  was  also  noted  that  recently  the  World   Health
    Organisation had begun to assist the  government  of  Sierra  Leone  in
    coordinating their mental health response to the crisis.  The  Tribunal
    noted that mental healthcare in Freetown was  limited.  However,  there
    was a psychiatrist there and there was no indication that he or she was
    not  able  to  prescribe  anti-depressants,  nor  unable   to   provide
    counselling. In all the circumstances, the appeal was refused.

26. Since the date of this decision,  background  evidence  evidences  that
    mental health services have improved but  still  lacking.  There  is  a
    hospital for mentally ill patients and those with  financial  resources
    are able to receive treatment. The appellant has his mother  and  other
    relatives in Sierra Leone to assist him.

27. I find that there is a material error of law in the  decision  for  the
    reasons set out above. Consequential to my  finding  that  there  is  a
    material error of law, I set aside the decision of  Judge  this  P.J.S.
    White. I remake the decision taking into account all the  evidence  and
    dismiss the appellant's appeal.




    Decision




28. The appeal by the Secretary of State is allowed and the decision of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge is set aside.  I remake the decision and
    dismiss the appellant's appeal.
