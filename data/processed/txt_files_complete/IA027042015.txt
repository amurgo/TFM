For the Respondent:    Mr M. Murphy Counsel instructed by Farani Javid
Taylor Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the determination of Immigration
    Judge Boardman promulgated on 26 August 2014 in which  he  allowed  the
    appeal of Mr Vashishat.  For the sake of continuity I shall refer to Mr
    Vashishat as the appellant as he was before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The allegation that was made by the Secretary  of  State  is  that  the
    appellant was guilty of fraud in that he made use of  the  services  of
    Migration Gurus who engineered payments from Ransab Limited  or  Ransab
    Managed Services to the appellant in order to bolster his earnings  for
    the purposes of bettering his position in the eyes of the Secretary  of
    State when considering the grants of  further  leave.   The  allegation
    that is made forms part of an application dated 27 March 2009 in  which
    the appellant claimed points for previous earnings from Ransab  Managed
    Services.  The expression "Ransab Managed Services" is  used  twice  at
    least in the decision letter and the expression "Ransab Limited" is not
    mentioned at all in the documents which are supporting this allegation.
     Accordingly, what Ransab Managed Services was or is  remains  entirely
    in doubt.  It could not reasonably refer simply Ransab Limited  because
    there would have been no reason for the decision maker to have conjured
    up a different name.  There must have been something before  him  which
    referred to Ransab Managed Services but there is nothing before  me  or
    was before the judge or indeed was before the Upper Tribunal Judge  who
    set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge in finding that
    there was an error of law.

 3. The background evidence however can be fairly easily derived, I  think,
    from a number of documents.  First of  all  there  is  the  application
    which whilst not actually dated 27 March 2009 is probably the  document
    referred to, (it being judged by the date that it arrived  rather  than
    the date which the document itself bears).  The document  is  dated  25
    March 2009 and is signed by V J Sorthia from  Migration  Gurus  and  at
    section 3A, L7 it refers to Ransab and it refers to  payments  made  of
    �6,000.  It also refers  to  a  letter  from  an  accountant  and  bank
    statements and remittance advice It covers dates from 1  February  2008
    to 31 March 2009.  It suggests that Ransab is a contractor.

 4. The supporting letters from accountant are found in the  bundle  at  G1
    and the letter from Migration Gurus is found at F1.   The  letter  from
    Migration Gurus dated 25 March 2009 shows at item 3 a remittance advice
    from Ransab with corroborating bank statements.  Although we  have  not
    got the remittance advice, we have got the bank statements.   The  bank
    statements make reference to two payments, the first payment is that of
    4 March 2009, the second payment is of 25 March 2009 and combined  they
    add up to �6,000.  They refer to transactions where there are  payments
    from Ransab Limited.  Those are then featured in the amounts which  are
    put forward by the appellant in support of the claim of  his  earnings.
    At G1 is a letter dated 26 March 2009 referring to contract  work  with
    Ransab showing payments of �6,000 and remittance advice 1  and  2.   On
    the basis of these documents I am sure that the reference to Ransab  is
    a reference to Ransab Limited and they show two payments which together
    total �6,000.  In my judgment there was, without any doubt,  a  payment
    of �6,000 to this appellant from an  account  held  by  Ransab  Limited
    which was used  by  him  to  seek  leave  to  remain  pursuant  to  the
    application that was made on 27 March 2009.  The curious fact  is  that
    these transactions take place on 24, 25  and  26  March  2009  and  the
    application was received on 27 March 2009. This is apparently referable
    to the fact that there was to be a change in the  Rules  and  this  was
    done hurriedly in order to show that the level of earnings was properly
    before the decision maker before  a  change  in  the  Rules  came  into
    effect.  This is the evidence of payment.  What the Secretary of  State
    says in the decision letter is that Ransab  Managed  Services  was  the
    relevant company.  There is no reference to Ransab Managed Services  in
    any of the documents that I have seen and so the  reference  to  Ransab
    Managed Services being a non-genuine company is something of a mystery.
     Save for the name, there is no evidence of  the  relationship  between
    Ransab Managed Services and Ransab Limited. I am invited to infer  that
    in this allegation of fraud Ransab Managed  Services  is  the  same  as
    Ransab Limited.  For the reasons that I will later give I do not  think
    it is easy to make that inference in the circumstances of this case.

 5. The evidence that was adduced in support of the allegation of fraud was
    an allegation from DC Laura Curry.  Part of her witness statement is to
    be seen in the papers before me.  Unfortunately it is very difficult to
    read.  It has a curious pagination.  You have page 1 of 1 but we do not
    have page 2 of 2 and then we have pages 3 of 3 onwards until page 19 of
    19.  There is no suggestion of any concluding paragraph but it  appears
    that the witness statement continues on.  We  have  not  got  the  full
    statement.

 6. There are however references within the document to Ransab Limited, for
    example there are payments referred  to  as  'Cash  Ransab'  and  'Cash
    Ransab' on page 19 of 19.  The appellant's name does not appear in  any
    of these documents.  The opening statement  of  the  witness  DC  Laura
    Curry is to the effect that  information  was  received  regarding  the
    activities of an immigration consultancy named Migration  Gurus.   This
    company was operated by two directors one of whom was Vijay Sorthia and
    he was the gentleman who filled in the application dated 25 March  2009
    which was received by the Secretary of  State  on  27  March.   In  the
    course of the statement it appears that a Blackberry mobile  phone  was
    found in the office of Migration Gurus on the cabinet next to the  desk
    used by Vijay  Sorthia.   The  download  relating  to  this  phone  was
    deciphered.  One sees on page 12 of 12 that there  are  two  pro  forma
    letters.   They refer to a number of companies.

 7. At 12 of 12, one of the companies is Ransab  Limited.   The  pro  forma
    letter reads

     'Can you please credit your monthly amount to  the  following  account:
         ...'   Name:  Ransab Limited.  Do not forget to mention  your  name
         and  case  reference  number   in   payment   reference   and   SMS
         confirmation.

 8. What the prosecution were saying in relation to the criminal trial  was
    that Vijay Sorthia and Migration Gurus  were  inviting  individuals  to
    make a monthly payment into an account of Ransab  Limited  then  Ransab
    Limited would then pay on that amount to the individual in what was  an
    entirely circular transaction so it would seem  as  if  Ransab  Limited
    were in fact making payments whereas all they  were  doing  was  paying
    back money that  had  already  been  provided  to  them.   It  is  said
    elsewhere in the statement that this was a  shell  bogus  company.   We
    know that it existed as a company and it was certainly described  as  a
    shell  company  and  we  also  know  that  there  were  various   named
    individuals who were apparently identified as people who were  involved
    in the payments of money.

 9. As far as we know the appellant himself  was  never  interviewed  about
    these events and was never charged or prosecuted.

10. The transaction is perhaps better set out at page 14 of  14  where  the
    spreadsheet shows the start date which relates  to  the  date  payments
    were to be paid to the bogus shell company bank  account.   UPC  stands
    for 'You pay company' and relates to the amount of money the client has
    to circulate through the bogus shell company bank account.  WPU  stands
    for 'We pay you' and relates to the amount of circulated money.   Vijay
    Sorthia pays that to the client to look like wages.  DIF refers to  the
    difference in the amount of money the client pays to  the  bogus  shell
    company bank account and the amount of money Vijay Sorthia transfers to
    the client's personal bank account which suggests that this was the cut
    that Vijay Sorthia made on each transaction.  That difference showed  a
    monthly surplus of �10,000 odd which DC Laura Curry suspected would  be
    the profit for Vijay Sorthia.

11. There is no evidence either from DC Curry or from any other source that
    the appellant himself was named in the documentation.   On  that  basis
    the Secretary of State says that one should infer the payment of monies
    to Ransab Limited by this appellant and that the  �6,000  that  he  was
    paid was in fact money that he paid to Ransab  Limited.   According  to
    the letter which I have referred to all of the transactions  were  done
    through the banking system.  They were paid into  the  Ransab  account.
    They did not apparently go into Migration Gurus'  account.   There  was
    simply a circular transaction.  There  is  some  evidence  that  Ransab
    Limited had expenses.  Whether there were ever any expenses paid by the
    company, we do not know.

12. It is the appellant's case that he was working legitimately for  Ransab
    Limited and that he was paid for carrying out some work on the computer
    system.  Now the obvious difficulties in the case as put forward by the
    respondent were that first of all the decision made by the Secretary of
    State  referred  to  Ransab  Managed  Services,  a  reference   to   an
    organisation which is nowhere else referred to and which we  are  asked
    to say must be Ransab Limited.  That does not entirely explain  how  an
    organisation so peculiarly named as Ransab Managed  Services  could  be
    mistaken for Ransab Limited.  It could not be from the letter from  the
    accountant nor could it be from the bank statements and since the  bank
    statements were accompanied by the remittance advice, although we  have
    not got the remittance advice, they must have been  remittance  advices
    to the same bank account and so all suggest that it was Ransab  Limited
    that was the company involved.  It is therefore not  easy  to  see  how
    Ransab Managed Services came to be mentioned.

13. The other difficulty is that although it was clear the prosecution  had
    before them a great many other transactions  no  transaction  involving
    this appellant is referred to.  The allegation is of generic  guilt  on
    the part of anybody who had any dealings with Ransab Limited, that  all
    are equally guilty of the offences of which some named individuals were
    undoubtedly guilty.

14. The third problem is that the evidence insofar as it  related  to  this
    appellant consists simply in the receipt of money.  One  has  to  infer
    that there was a related payment by him to Ransab Limited perhaps in  a
    slightly greater amount containing the cut which  Vijay  Sorthia  would
    receive.  That  cut  would  have  resulted  in  Ransab  paying  to  the
    appellant the �6,000 which we see in the bank statements.  On any  view
    there is a great deal of additional paperwork which  the  Tribunal  was
    invited to infer was in existence in order to support  the  allegations
    that this appellant was acting fraudulently.  There is indeed  a  great
    deal of suspicion.  If the standard of proof was a real  risk,  I  dare
    say I would find that the case is made out but to have been established
    on balance of probabilities  or  beyond  reasonable  doubt  is  a  very
    different matter.

15. Immigration Judge C M Phillips had this  to  say  having  reviewed  the
    evidence and the case-law in paragraph 35 of his determination:

         "I find that it is clear from relevant case-law that dishonesty  is
         required to found a refusal under paragraph 322(2).  I find that in
         this case the appellant does not accept that he has been  dishonest
         and he has  provided  the  unchallenged  company  print  out,  bank
         statement and HMRC documents  that  I  have  noted  and  considered
         above."

     Pausing there, it is clear that the appellant  provided  evidence  that
    he had paid tax on the sums received.  That of course is neutral as far
    as whether it was a legitimate payment.  The judge continues:

         "Having considered all the evidence I find that the respondent  has
         raised suspicion  but  has  not  provided  sufficient  evidence  to
         justify a finding that the respondent has discharged the burden  of
         proof that the requirements of paragraph 322(2) have  been  met  in
         respect of  the  appellant's  previous  application.   Because  the
         refusal under paragraph 322(1A) follows on from  and  is  dependent
         upon a finding that the requirements of paragraph  322(2)  are  met
         his appeal is allowed because I find that the  appellant's  current
         application does not fall for  refusal  under  paragraph  276B(iii)
         (general grounds for refusal)."

     He therefore found that the evidence provided by the respondent  raised
    suspicion but had not  provided  sufficient  evidence  to  justify  the
    finding of dishonesty.

16. When the matter came  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  appeal  by  the
    Secretary of State Judge Chamberlain who found that there was an  error
    of law said (quoting from the passages that I have  referred  to)  also
    looked at paragraph 32 which deals with the witness  statement   of  DC
    Curry.  He quotes the First-tier Tribunal Judge as saying:

         "I have looked at the evidence on the basis that the appellant  has
         provided evidence from Ransab Limited, which is also referred to as
         a shell company in the witness statement of DC Curry.  As  set  out
         above, I find that the  evidence  raises  the  suspicion  that  the
         appellant made false representations because  his  application  was
         submitted by Migration Gurus"

17. Judge Chamberlain however found that the judge failed to  pay  adequate
    attention to DC Curry's  statement.   Ransab  Limited  was  not  merely
    referred to but listed in DC Curry's statement as a bogus company.   He
    found that the judge had failed to fully consider this evidence.

     'The evidence showed that Ransab Limited was a  false  company  set  up
         for the purpose of assisting applicants to show that they  had  had
         the required income for Tier 1 applications.'

     He pointed out that the appellant claimed  to  have  received  earnings
from this     company.  He continued:

     'The fact that the  appellant  is  not  named  in  DC  Curry's  witness
         statement does not detract from the fact that he  claimed  earnings
         from the company which the evidence showed to  be  false.   In  his
         reasoning the judge ignores the evidence that  Ransab  Limited  was
         not a legitimate functioning company but was a bogus company.   The
         standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities and I find  in
         failing to take into account the  evidence  that  the  company  was
         false and in stating that the evidence only  showed  suspicion  the
         judge applied too high a burden of proof.'

18. Judge Chamberlain also went on to  point  out  the  evidence  that  the
    appellant had provided and commented that there  was  a  printout  form
    Companies House and the fact that the appellant declared this income to
    HMRC did not mean the income was genuine.  In  those  circumstances  he
    found that there was a material error of  law  and  he  set  aside  the
    decision for it to be re-made.  It is in this context that  the  matter
    comes before me.

19. I have come to the conclusion that  I  share  the  view  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge CM Phillips and that the evidence does indeed raise  the
    most serious suspicions but is not sufficient to establish  on  balance
    of probabilities that every transaction that was  conducted  by  Ransab
    Limited was inevitably an unlawful transaction.  We do not know because
    the evidence does not tell us that every transaction that this  company
    entered into was bound to have been a dishonest one.  Inevitably it was
    directed towards the dishonest transactions which were the  subject  of
    the criminal proceedings.  It would have been a  simple  enough  matter
    for DC Curry to have expanded her  statement  to  have  included  other
    named individuals including this appellant and to have said that  these
    transactions were false.  More importantly it would have been  possible
    to have shown that there was money coming into Ransab Limited which was
    directly referable to the payments payable by this appellant to  Ransab
    Limited which could only be attributed to the circularity which is  the
    feature of this appeal.

20.  There  were  indeed  grave  suspicions  that  this  was  a   dishonest
    transaction  or  two  dishonest  transactions   but   it   requires   a
    considerable amount of speculation even assuming that the reference  in
    the decision letter to Ransab  Managed  Services  was  a  typographical
    error and should have read Ransab Limited.  The transaction took  place
    in 2009 so it may well be it is now impossible to  recreate  events  as
    easily as it was at the time this prosecution was conducted.  We do not
    know what the full extent of the evidence of the police was in relation
    to this transaction but for the reasons that I have stated  I  consider
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge was correct in saying that it raised
    suspicion but was not sufficient to establish  that  every  transaction
    conducted by Ransab Limited was inevitably a dishonest one without  the
    specific reference provided by DC Curry to this appellant and  the  two
    specific transactions which we know are recorded as payments to  Ransab
    Limited.

21. In these circumstances on re-making the decision I  conclude  that  the
    Secretary of State did not discharge the burden of proof on balance  of
    probabilities as she was required to do.

DECISION

                 1. Judge Chamberlain found the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
                    made an error on a point of law and  that  the  decision
                    required re-making.
                 2. In re-making the decision, I substitute a  determination
                    allowing the appeal  of  Munish  Vashishat  against  the
                    decision of the Secretary of State refusing to vary  the
                    claimant's leave to remain and to remove him by  way  of
                    directions under s.47 of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
                    Nationality Act 2006.
