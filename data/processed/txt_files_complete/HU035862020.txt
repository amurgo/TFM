                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


 1. I shall refer to the Respondent as the Appellant as he was known before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of India.  His date of birth is  22  October
    1992. The judge did not make a direction to  anonymise  the  Appellant.
    However, he anonymised the Appellant, referring to her as 'P.'  In  the
    light of  the  evidence  of  P's  health  condition,  I  anonymise  the
    Appellant to protect P's identity.

 3. On 31 December 2020 the Secretary of State was  granted  permission  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes to  appeal  against  the  decision  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Shergill (promulgated on  17  November
    2020) to allow the Appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State (dated 19 February 2020) to refuse  the  Appellant's
    application for leave to remain on human rights grounds (on  the  basis
    of family life with his partner, P).   The matter  came  before  me  to
    determine whether Judge Shergill made an error of law.

 4. The Appellant came to the UK on 20 September 2014 having  been  granted
    entry clearance as a student.  He made an application on  human  rights
    grounds which was refused and certified  as  clearly  unfounded  on  21
    January 2019.  On 6 August 2019 he made another application  to  remain
    here under Article 8.  This application was refused under paragraph 353
    of the Immigration Rules on 5 November 2019.  As a  result  of  a  pre-
    action protocol letter the Secretary of State agreed to reconsider  the
    application.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The matter started by way of a remote hearing however, the  judge  said
    at paragraph 4 that there were problems with the Respondent being  able
    to connect to the hearing.  The judge said that he decided to deal with
    the case in "a pragmatic way" and had the clerk email a memo  from  him
    to the Appellant's solicitor copied to  the  Respondent.   It  read  as
    follows:

         "The tribunal has been informed that there are widespread IT issues
         preventing the HO from being able to access emails, files  and  CVP
         (phone and video).  I understand there is no timetable for this  to
         be resolved.

         Even prior to being notified of this, I had  considered  this  case
         was suitable for  submissions  only.   The  HO  have  accepted  the
         genuineness of the relationship, yet the various additional witness
         evidence only speak to these issues.  I would not have  anticipated
         much if any cross examination of those witnesses.

         The appellant and his partner set out a fairly clear set of reasons
         why they would face problems if the appellant was to return.  There
         is nothing new in any of this that has not  been  set  out  on  the
         refusal and/or skeleton.

         The pivotal evidence is the doctor's letter.  That is  a  matter  I
         will need to take account of  whether  I  consider  it  amounts  to
         insurmountable obstacles (over and  above  that  has  already  been
         pleaded about the problems she will face as not  being  from  India
         etc).

         The case law is Agyarko and more recently Lal [2019] EWCA Civ 1925.
          The case really boils down  to  whether  the  evidence  before  me
         satisfies the second formulation of those  obstacles  in  Lal  that
         "could be overcome but to do so would entail very serious  hardship
         to one or both of them".

         Even a generous view taken that  the  problems  claimed  amount  to
         insurmountable obstacles is not the end of the  matter  as  section
         117B bites.  There are factors I would have to consider whether any
         permanent rupture in family life, which is effectively what appears
         may happen, is proportionate.  That is confirmed in case law that a
         person's immigration status may "greatly affect the  weight  to  be
         given to their right to respect for family life" (para 48  of  Lal,
         and paras 47-55).  As I understand it the appellant has  overstayed
         by 3 years  but  there  is  nothing  else  of  adverse  immigration
         interest?

         In the alternative, my usual approach would be to consider why  the
         appellant cannot return temporarily and  make  an  out  of  country
         application (i.e., Chikwamba, Chen case law).  That  is  where  the
         medical letter comes in - as do factors that  the  [partner]  earns
         over the �18,600 threshold and there is  nothing  else  substantive
         pleaded in the  refusal  about  the  public  interest  which  would
         suggest  the  application  would  not  succeed.   That  leaves  the
         tribunal to consider why is it in the public  interest  to  require
         the appellant to leave, to make an application on the  face  of  it
         likely to succeed but  would  leave  the  partner  in  a  stressful
         situation.  That also seems to engage GEN3.2  exceptional  circs  -
         and I have previously held that exceptional circs  can  lead  to  a
         different outcome to insurmountable obstacles on  the  same  facts.
         Obviously, I have not made up my mind on matters, but I am  scoping
         out what I see as  a  relatively  narrow  legal/evidential  set  of
         issues for me to consider.

         In considering these matters, I see no reason why the  case  cannot
         be concluded with 48 hours being given to the  HO  to  produce  any
         brief written submissions  if  they  wish  to  make  any,  and  the
         appellant's reps being given a further 48 hours to do the same.   I
         can then consider matters on the papers.

         The appellant's rep will be invited to address the tribunal."

 6. The Appellant's representative, Ms Barton was recorded by the judge  as
    having agreed with  the  suggestion  save  for  the  concern  that  the
    Respondent might have wanted to  cross-examine  the  witnesses.   As  a
    result, the judge sent directions to the parties which she set  out  at
    paragraph 5 of the decision:

         "1.  In exercise of its  case  management  functions  the  tribunal
             asked the clerk to send a preliminary view of the  key  issues
             in the case setting out why the case was suitable for  written
             submissions only.  As this  was  a  possible  option,  it  was
             considered in the interests of justice to attempt  to  proceed
             rather than adjourn.

         2.   The HOPO had not responded to the email or been able  to  join
             the CVP hearing and it is noted in lieu of a written record of
             proceedings that Ms Barton  was  amenable  to  the  tribunal's
             proposed approach.  Her only concern was that if the HOPO  had
             wanted to ask questions of the intended  witnesses  it  leaves
             the door open to an appeal.  I indicated I thought  given  the
             skeleton and contents of the statements  that  little  if  any
             cross-examination was likely, but it was appropriate to obtain
             the respondent's input into that (an informal approach via the
             clerk phoning before we convened had been deemed inappropriate
             by the tribunal).

         3.   The case was therefore reserved on the basis that  it  can  be
             considered  on  the  available  evidence  with   any   written
             submissions as per my  email  save  that  the  respondent  may
             request a resumed hearing before me  if  there  are  important
             issues that require cross-examination.

         The Following Directions are made: -

         1.   The respondent is  to  notify  the  tribunal  and  appellant's
             solicitors by email/fax if  they  object  to  the  case  being
             considered on the papers within 48 hours of service  of  these
             directions.

         2.   If that is the case, then the  respondent  is  to  list  which
             witnesses   are   required   for   cross-examination   and   a
             resumed/part-heard  hearing  will  be  listed   before   Judge
             Shergill on the next available date.

         3.   Alternatively, if the respondent is content to proceed on  the
             papers and make  written  submissions  then  these  should  be
             served within 48 hours of service of these directions.

         4.   The solicitors are to file  any  rebuttal/further  submissions
             within 48 hours of receipt of the document listed  at  para  4
             above.  The case will  then  proceed  to  be  decided  on  the
             papers.

         5.   The tribunal may issue further directions if required."

 7. The judge said that the directions were emailed on 2 November 2020  and
    as there was no response from the Secretary of State by the end of that
    week further directions  were  made  that  the  solicitor  should  make
    further representations by 10 November 2020.  The judge  recorded  that
    there was no communication from either party and therefore he proceeded
    to determine the appeal on the documents before him.

 8. The judge made findings at paragraphs 8 to 17.  The  judge  found  that
    there would not  be  "very  significant  obstacles"  to  the  Appellant
    returning to India. The judge said  that  the  Appellant  has  a  "poor
    immigration history" (see  paragraph  9).   The  judge  said  that  the
    Appellant's "entire family life and private life (apart from one  year)
    has been established whilst he has been here  unlawfully  and  as  such
    little weight is attached to it."

 9. The judge stated:-

         "The public interest weighs against his private life claims and  in
         favour of the legitimate aim  of  the  economic  interests  of  the
         United Kingdom through maintaining effective  immigration  control.
         I am not satisfied that there is any unlawful  or  disproportionate
         interference with the Appellant's private life whatsoever if he was
         to be removed from the United Kingdom."

10. The judge at paragraph 10 said that he accepted that the Appellant  was
    in a genuine relationship and that they could rely on Appendix FM in  a
    future application.  He said the "question really boils down  to  where
    the public interest lies as a result" (see paragraph 10).

11. At paragraph 11 the judge said as follows:

         "11. I do not consider it is controversial to conclude P would face
             very serious hardship if she was required to  move  to  India.
             As a British citizen, and a white woman she is likely to  face
             a culture shock in reformulating her life out there.  This  is
             portrayed in a bleak way of the  couple  living  in  the  home
             village  and  the  traditional  nature  of   that   lifestyle.
             However, India  is  a  vibrant,  multi-cultural  country  with
             various large metropolitan areas the couple could move to.   I
             see no reason why  they  could  not  reformulate  their  lives
             together and become self-sufficient.  There is  no  persuasive
             evidence of probative value as to why P could not find work as
             a foreigner.  Her main issue is her mental health.  However, I
             note she holds down a  full-time  job  here.   The  doctor  is
             concerned with her reformulating  her  life  in  India,  which
             would be alien to her.  However,  he  has  failed  to  explain
             whether her mental health problems could be managed (including
             the suicidal thoughts) in a way similar to an Article 3 claim.
              By that I mean, managed through medication here and abroad in
             order to alleviate her situation.  I also note on the one hand
             P has strained family connections and relies on the appellant,
             yet she has some contact  with  them  too.   The  evidence  is
             equivocal and portrayed in bleak terms  in  my  view.   In  my
             assessment, people adapt  to  finalised  decisions  more  than
             being left in limbo.  There is no evidence of probative weight
             as to the impact of a finalised decision for the appellant  to
             leave the country and what the impact on P would be if she was
             to actually go with him  or  how  she  would  manage.   I  was
             concerned how  much  of  the  claims  of  difficulties  to  be
             overcome  were  anything  more  that  a  worst-case   scenario
             envisaged by the protagonists.  P cannot  have  expected  that
             the appellant would have  been  permitted  to  stay  from  the
             outset of their relationship, so some  form  of  temporary  or
             permanent return is likely to have at least been at  the  back
             of their minds.  Ultimately, P  may  leave  with  him  or  may
             remain here and try to get him to come back.  A future out  of
             country application is the most likely scenario  and  as  such
             there is not likely to be a permanent rupture.

         12.  Even taking the case at its highest, the impact on P rupturing
             the relationship with the appellant has to  be  considered  in
             light of the statutory framework.  Paragraphs  47  onwards  of
             Lal confirms the jurisprudence in this area of someone who has
             had no lawful status.  I take a dim view  of  the  immigration
             history of an appellant who has overstayed a visa and not made
             any attempt at regularising  his  position  for  a  number  of
             years.  I was not satisfied that he had a good reason  why  he
             was unable to navigate the immigration  system  to  regularise
             his position, or return to India,  rather  than  overstay  and
             start a relationship.  Something he should  have  done  before
             2018.  I note that a person's immigration status may  "greatly
             affect the weight to be given to their right  to  respect  for
             family  life"  (para  48  of  Lal).   The  duration   of   the
             relationship  is  relatively  short,  albeit  they  have   now
             recently married.  It was  established  at  a  time  when  the
             appellant was here unlawfully.  I am not  satisfied  P  is  an
             innocent victim in any of  this.   It  is  therefore  entirely
             justifiable on public interest grounds that little  weight  is
             given to the relationship.  Section 117B(4)(b) applies  and  I
             attach  little  weight  to  the  family  life  rights  of  the
             appellant or P (para 55 of Lal).  This is not  an  exceptional
             case requiring an  article  8  grant  of  leave  save  for  my
             observations below (para 47).  Those are my conclusions  under
             insurmountable obstacles and the relevant case law there."

    He then stated as follows:-

         "13. On the face of it the appellant falls under the Chen, Dulagan,
             and Chikwamba line of  authorities  i.e.  that  he  should  be
             expected to return and make an out of country application.   I
             found there was no persuasive evidence as to why he could  not
             go back to his family or  rent  accommodation.   He  could  be
             expected to leave the  UK  and  comply  with  the  rules  like
             everyone else for entry clearance."

         14.  However, there is an aspect of 'exceptionality' to this  case.
             I note P has depression and "frequent suicidal thoughts".  She
             has had a difficult childhood and  was  a  looked-after  child
             early on and then in later adolescence.  She has some  contact
             with others but the GP is of the  view  that  "her  only  real
             support" is her husband.  I note she works in a clerical  role
             earning over the �18,600  threshold.   Whilst  ordinarily  the
             appellant might be required to leave the country  to  make  an
             out  of  country  application,  I  note  the  following.   The
             application is likely to succeed  given  the  content  of  the
             refusal not taking great issue with  any  aspect.   I  take  a
             different, 'dim view' of  the  immigration  history  than  the
             respondent, but I note the respondent's policy would not treat
             the immigration history in the same way as my 'dim view' on an
             out of country application.  I also note there is the  context
             of a global pandemic and the appellant's potential  return  to
             country with a raging COVID-19 crisis; but that  aside,  there
             will be ongoing uncertainty and a  lack  of  finality  to  the
             immigration status.  I accept this may exacerbate  P's  mental
             health problems.  It is somewhat churlish  to  put  P  through
             that anguish only for the appellant to jump through  formality
             hoops with a likelihood of being permitted to return to the UK
             as a spouse.

         15.  I accept P's situation is unusual and the  impact  on  her  is
             significant looking at  the  history  of  what  she  has  been
             through in her past, and her likely  emotional  dependence  on
             the appellant as a result.  In the context of a Chikwamba type
             case, I accept  this  amounts  to  exceptional  circumstances.
             Those exceptional circumstances  arise  because  refusing  the
             appellant leave to remain would result in unjustifiably  harsh
             consequences for P because it is likely  to  lead  to  adverse
             mental health issues, in particular suicidal thoughts.  She is
             likely to be faced with isolation and  significant  disruption
             to her  emotional  well-being  when  looking  at  all  of  the
             evidence in the round and  taking  into  account  the  medical
             evidence and her past history.  It is disproportionate to  put
             her through that turmoil  and  separation,  even  short-lived,
             just to await an out of country application that has  all  the
             hallmarks of being allowed."

The grounds of appeal

12. The grounds assert that the judge  makes  contradictory  findings.   He
    dismisses the Appellant's private life claims and finds that there  are
    no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  continuing  in  India.
    Moreover, he finds that there is nothing exceptional  about  the  case.
    Yet he then finds that there are exceptional circumstances and  applies
    Chikwamba.  The First-tier Tribunal has misinterpreted Chikwamba v SSHD
    [2008] UKHL 40.  It is not necessarily  the  case  that  the  Appellant
    would satisfy the requirements for entry clearance.  In any event there
    are no "exceptional Article  8  grounds".  The  case  of  Chikwamba  is
    distinguishable. There are no exceptional Article 8 grounds that  would
    make it disproportionate for the Appellant  to  return  and  apply  for
    entry clearance.  In Chikwamba there was a risk to the individual which
    is not the case here. The judge had found that the couple can  maintain
    a life in India.

13. The parties made submission. Mr Tan relied on the grounds of appeal. Ms
    Barton           relied on her skeleton argument.

14. There is no cross challenge by the Appellant in respect of any  of  the
    findings of fact. Neither party raised  an  issue  in  respect  of  the
    procedure adopted by the judge determining the appeal.

The Appellant's skeleton argument

15. It is accepted by the Appellant that the wording used by the judge "may
    be seen as  clumsy  and  could  be  seen  as  somewhat  contradictory",
    however, the FTTJ has not erred. He found an aspect of "exceptionality"
    and said that the case  is  unusual.  Having  regard  to  Chikwamba  he
    accepted that the case amounts to exceptional  circumstances.   Failure
    to consider Younas (section  117B(6)(b);  Chikwamba;  Zambrano)  [2020]
    UKUT 00129 does not amount to an error of law. Each case turns  on  its
    facts. The judge was entitled to conclude  on  the  evidence  that  the
    Appellant would on an  application  for  entry  clearance  be  able  to
    satisfy the Rules.  While the judge does not find anything exceptional,
    he then considered P's  circumstances. He  concluded  that  the  appeal
    should  be  allowed  under  GEN.3.2  (2)   because   there   would   be
    unjustifiably harsh consequences for her. He said that if he  is  wrong
    about that, the decision breaches her  rights  under  Article  8.   The
    judge properly considered the public interest considerations.

Error of law

16. The judge found that  there  are  not  very  significant  obstacles  to
    integration (paragraph 276ADE (1) (vi)). He found that  there  are  not
    insurmountable obstacles to family  life  continuing  in  India  (EX.1.
    Appendix FM). He concluded that little weight should be attached to the
    family life as between the Appellant and his partner. Finally, he found
    that this is not an exceptional case requiring the grant of leave under
    Article 8. There is no cross challenge to any  of  these  findings.  He
    does not meet the requirements of the Rules and he finds that there  is
    no reason to allow the appeal outside of the Rules. Properly understood
    the judge found that the decision to refuse the  Appellant  leave  does
    not breach the Appellant's substantive rights under Article 8.




17. However, he then went onto consider whether it would  be  proportionate
    to expect the Appellant to return to India to make an  application  for
    entry clearance. This is totally at odds  with  the  finding  that  the
    decision does not breach the Appellant's rights under Article 8. Having
    dismissed the appeal on Article 8 substantive grounds, an appeal cannot
    succeed on procedural grounds. His conclusions  are  contradictory  and
    perverse.  It is difficult to understand how the  substantive  decision
    does not breach the Appellant's rights under Article 8, but to  require
    the Appellant to make an application for entry clearance  would.   This
    is a clear material error of law.


18. I set aside the decision of the judge to allow the appeal on Article  8
    procedural grounds.

Conclusions


19. The judge made clear findings that the decision does not interfere with
    the Appellant's Article 8 rights. He does not meet the  Rules  and  the
    decision to refuse to grant him leave does  not  otherwise  breach  his
    rights  under  Article  8.   The  appeal  therefore  should  have  been
    dismissed at this stage.  In the absence of a cross challenge, I remake
    the appeal and dismiss it on substantive Article 8 grounds.

Notice of Decision

The Appellant's appeal is dismissed under Article 8.
