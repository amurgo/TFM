Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr A Chohan, Counsel


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    I shall refer to the  parties  as  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
      Appellants are citizens of Pakistan born on 15th March  1976  and  1st
      February 1996. Their appeal against the Respondent's decision of  18th
      February 2014 refusing entry clearance  under  paragraph  319  of  the
      Immigration Rules was allowed by the First-tier Tribunal on 22nd  July
      2014.


2.    Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Holmes
      on 8th August 2014 on  the  grounds  that  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Burnett found that the bank statements of the type  "Business  Current
      Account" were personal bank statements because the Sponsor was a  sole
      trader.

3.    At  the  hearing  before  me,  Mr  Duffy  submitted  that  Appendix  E
      paragraph  (j)  stated  that  the  applicant  must  provide  specified
      documents as set out in  paragraph 1B of  Appendix  C.  The  specified
      documents are personal bank or building society statements covering  a
      90 day period. It was accepted that the Sponsor was a sole trader, but
      he had submitted statements from a business account, not his  personal
      account. This was not acceptable under the Immigration Rules.

4.    Mr Chohan submitted that the Sponsor's account was for his  use  alone
      because he was a sole trader not a limited company.  The  Sponsor  was
      responsible for the account and there was no third party involved. The
      Sponsor was operating the account and had sole access to the funds. He
      made cash withdrawals and there was nothing to indicate that the funds
      were not available for the Sponsor's personal use.

5.    I find that the bank statements submitted were business  bank  account
      statements and not personal bank account statements and therefore they
      did not comply with the Immigration Rules. I  also  indicated  at  the
      start of the hearing that the statements did not cover a 90 day period
      in any event.  Mr  Chohan  accepted  that  there  were  no  statements
      covering the period from 11th October 2013 to 3rd November 2013.

6.    Accordingly, I find that the  Judge  erred  in  law  in  allowing  the
      appeal under the Immigration  Rules.  The  bank  statements  were  not
      personal bank statements and did not  cover  the  required  period.  I
      allow the Respondent's appeal and set aside  the  determination  dated
      22nd July 2014. I remake the  decision  as  follows:  The  Appellants'
      appeal under the Immigration Rules is dismissed.  The  Appellants  did
      not rely on Article 8.

7.    The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant  to  rule  45(4)(i)  of
      the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005. There  was
      no application to vary or discharge the anonymity  order.  I  continue
      that order (pursuant to rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
      Tribunal) Rules 2008).
