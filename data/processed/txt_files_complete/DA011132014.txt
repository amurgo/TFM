                          DETERMINATION BY CONSENT

    Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and by the consent of the parties the following order is made:

         Upon the parties agreement that the determination of the First-tier
         Tribunal promulgated on 14th  October  2014  discloses  a  material
         error of law, it is hereby order by consent that:

          1. The judge applied the incorrect Immigration Rule  in  reaching
             his decision,

          2. The determination is set aside with no findings preserved, and



          3. The matter is remitted to be heard by a judge  of  the  First-
             tier Tribunal other than Judge I. Ross.

         The Secretary of State's appeal in the Upper Tribunal is  therefore
         allowed.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside  for
         legal error.
