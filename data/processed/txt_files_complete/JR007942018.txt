                              APPROVED JUDGMENT
                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -



MR JUSTICE WAKSMAN:


 1. This is an application  for  judicial  review  of  a  decision  by  the
    Secretary of State not to grant a right of abode to the  applicant,  Mr
    Abdul Matin Abdul Mannan, to whom I shall refer as "Mr Mannan".

 2. Permission to bring judicial review  proceedings  was  granted  by  the
    Upper Tribunal  on  28  November  2018.  Mr  Mannan  is  a  Bangladeshi
    national, and it is common ground that if he can show that  his  father
    was Mr Abdul Rashid, a Bangladeshi national, but who resided  here  for
    some time and obtained various citizenship rights here, then the  right
    to abode is made out.  This therefore a very  straightforward  question
    of fact which I have to decide on the evidence before me, to see if  Mr
    Mannan can establish on the balance of probabilities that Mr Rashid  is
    his father.

 3. This is one of those  judicial  reviews  where  the  issue  is  one  of
    precedent fact and so I am now the fact-finding Tribunal. Let  me  make
    some key introductory points.

 4. DNA testing has shown that Mr Mannan is the half-sibling of Mr Hoq,  so
    either they share the same mother or the same father.  Mr Hoq, for  his
    part, obtained the right of abode from the First-tier  Tribunal  on  22
    August 2014 by succeeding in his appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  against
    the decision of the Secretary of State not to grant him that right.  He
    had to show, and he did show in the satisfaction of that Tribunal, that
    his father was Mr Rashid.  Mr Mannan, and indeed Mr Hoq,  say  that  it
    was the father that they had in common, not their mother.



The Evidence

 5. I have had an array of documentary evidence sent to support Mr Mannan's
    application, and of course the DNA results, though by  themselves  they
    could not be sufficient; but I have also heard and  seen  Mr  Hoq  give
    evidence, which in my view was important.  He came to court because  he
    is now living here, and although he needed an interpreter, Mr Ahmed, to
    whom I am very grateful, his evidence was no less clear  for  that.   I
    did not hear from Mr Mannan, still in  Bangladesh.   It  is  true  that
    there was in theory the possibility of adducing evidence by video  link
    from Bangladesh in the rural area where he lives, though I am not  sure
    of the practicalities of successfully doing that, but I must,  and  do,
    take into account that I have had no direct oral evidence from him.   I
    also take into account the fact that neither  his  brief  affidavit  in
    support of his application, nor the witness statement of  Mr  Hoq  said
    very much about their lives together in Bangladesh and with Mr  Rashid.
    That detail was elicited in the course of Mr Hoq's oral  evidence  this
    morning.

 6. I need to read certain passages from the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in relation to Mr Hoq's application.  Paragraph 3 recites that
    Mr Rashid had become a British citizen in 1952.   In  paragraph  4  the
    judge recites the relevant documents before him, the appellant's  birth
    certificate registered in 1972 (and that was the original), there  were
    then the land documents which I  will  come  back  to  later,  and  the
    father's name is referred to  in  various  pages  of  those  documents.
    There was an affidavit from the midwife and there was testimony of  the
    villagers, and there were school documents showing  Mr  Hoq's  father's
    name.  The land documents show the names of both Mr Hoq and his father.
     There was a marriage  certificate,  his  father's  national  insurance
    card, his Siemens ID card, and therefore a  vast  number  of  documents
    which were original and contemporary showing the name of the  appellant
    and his father.

 7. At paragraph 11 the judge said that there was  a  wealth  of  documents
    before him to show that Mr Rashid and the  appellant  were  father  and
    son.  The original documents could  not  possibly  have  been  produced
    solely for the benefit of the appeal. While the respondent stated  that
    fraudulent documentation was readily available in Bangladesh  and  seen
    on a regular basis at the High  Commission,  that  was  very  far  from
    substantiating or even alleging that false documents were used in  this
    particular application.  While the  applicant  did  indeed  wait  until
    after Mr Rashid's death before applying for citizenship, that  did  not
    invalidate his application.  The judge said that he  was  satisfied  on
    the balance of probabilities that  he  was  related  to  Mr  Rashid  as
    claimed and therefore the appeal was allowed.

 8. Let me turn to the evidence of Mr Hoq before me.  I am going to set  it
    out all in one go for convenience sake.

 9. First, let me deal with  the  early  years.   Mr  Hoq  in  his  witness
    statement said that Mr Rashid had been married twice.   He  married  Mr
    Mannan's mother, Joymona Banu, on 4 July 1939.  At the time  there  was
    no marriage registration system in place, consequently people were only
    required to register their marriage through a deed.  A copy of his late
    father's marriage deed is enclosed.  From this marriage his father  had
    two children, namely the applicant and his younger sister, both of them
    currently reside in Bangladesh.  Mr Hoq further confirms that his  late
    father married his mother, the late Khoyrun Nessa ("Ms Nessa"),  on  15
    June 1960.  At the time she was 17 years old and he enclosed a copy  of
    that marriage certificate.  There were two children of  that  marriage,
    Mr Hoq and his younger sister who is currently residing in Bangladesh.

10. Also I record what Mr Hoq said in paragraph 8 because I shall  need  to
    refer to it hereafter. He mentioned  that  in  Bangladesh  it  is  very
    common for a man to marry more than once.  The  law  allows  a  man  to
    marry more than one woman and be married up to four women at  the  same
    time, and therefore his father married in accordance with the law.   He
    then refers to the DNA testing.

11. As to the marriage deed to which Mr Hoq referred, I have a copy  of  it
    here.  If it is correct, recording a marriage in  1960,  and  recording
    that the bride, Ms Nessa, was a maiden in the sense that  she  had  not
    been married before and was 17 years old,  then,  if  all  of  that  is
    right, and if Mr Mannan is right to say that he was born in 1956,  then
    for he and Mr Hoq to have shared Ms Nessa as their  mother,  she  would
    have been unmarried at the time of his birth and only 12 or 13.  It  is
    possible, but I agree with Mr Karim, it is highly unlikely,  especially
    in rural Bangladesh and given the  prevailing  Muslim  culture  at  the
    time.

12. I will say now some more about Mr Hoq's evidence at  paragraph  8.   He
    said in oral evidence that his  mother,  Ms  Nessa,  that  Mr  Mannan's
    mother had died before Mr Rashid had remarried.   In  other  words,  he
    remarried only after his first wife had died and Mr Hoq was very  clear
    about this in evidence, but if so that raises the question as to why he
    felt  it  necessary  to  refer  to  the  permissibility  of  polygamous
    marriages where Mr Rashid had not engaged in polygamous marriages.   He
    said by way of explanation today that this was normal, but in this case
    it not did not apply but he simply mentioned it.  That is  not  a  very
    full answer to the point and I take that into account.

13. Then I turn to the biographical history of Mr Mannan, Mr Rashid and  Mr
    Hoq.  Mr Hoq said that he knows Mr Mannan.  He is ten or  twelve  years
    older than him, but they stayed and grew up in the same house.  He also
    had the opportunity to know  Mr  Rashid,  although  not  for  too  long
    because if the documents are right, Mr Rashid died in 1977, whereas  Mr
    Hoq was only born in 1965.  He said that Mr Mannan lived with  him  and
    he said that they lived together after Ms Nessa had died.  He was aware
    of the fact that subsequently Mr Mannan went to Saudi Arabia  for  some
    period of time.  He said that when Mr Rashid  had  died  his  land  was
    divided between the children, certainly between the two sons  being  Mr
    Mannan and being Mr Hoq.  The land that was left to Mr  Hoq,  he  said,
    was not in the house where he had been living and where his mother  had
    lived, but about fifteen minutes away in this rural  area  he  said  he
    went to the land that he was given and built a house there.  Mr  Mannan
    stayed on in the original house.  Indeed, this was  the  basis  of  the
    land documents which he was able to produce to the First-tier  Tribunal
    which named both him as successor, and the original landowner, being Mr
    Rashid.  Mr Hoq was clear that the same thing happened to Mr Mannan who
    got a plot as well.  That obviously raised the question as  to  whether
    there was not a land document which Mr Mannan could produce but has not
    done so in the course of these proceedings.  Mr  Hoq  said  that  there
    would be and there should be and Mr Mannan would have it.

14. Dealing with the later  period  in  their  lives,  even  after  Mr  Hoq
    obtained his citizen right of abode here, he kept in  contact  with  Mr
    Mannan and saw him when he went back for a visit to Bangladesh in 2015.
     He last spoke to him he said on the telephone three or four  days  ago
    and therein regular telephone contact, so it cannot really be  disputed
    that they seem to know each  other  pretty  well.   If  I  accept  that
    evidence as true, then Mr  Mannan  and  Mr  Hoq  grew  up  together  as
    brothers or half-brothers for at least a number of years,  even  though
    Mr Mannan was ten to twelve years senior to Mr Hoq.   They  both  lived
    with Mr Rashid and Ms Nessa, they both knew Mr Rashid,  though  Mr  Hoq
    less well, because of when Mr Rashid is said to have died.  I  have  to
    say that on its face I found Mr Hoq's account to be clear and  coherent
    and not vague in any important respects as Ms Dring had submitted.   It
    is true that the early life  details  did  not  feature  in  a  witness
    statement, but in one sense that is to Mr Hoq's credit because  it  was
    not as if he had a particular script to follow.   He  was  volunteering
    the details as and when they were asked of him.  On the other hand, one
    can ask why these details had not been put in a  witness  statement  as
    they should have been, and I take that into account, but as I say I did
    not find Mr Hoq's evidence on these points to be rehearsed in any  way.
    Indeed, when Mr Hoq volunteered that Mr Mannan  should  have  the  same
    sort of land documents as he would have, that was what I thought was  a
    genuine concession because,  of  course,  it  would  indeed  raise  the
    inevitable question as to why then it had not  been  produced  on  this
    application.

15. So far as the obtaining of documents is concerned, Mr Hoq said that  he
    obtained  the  documents  so  far  from  Mr  Rashid.   So  far  as  his
    application was concerned from his mother when she was still alive, she
    having obtained them from her husband, Mr Rashid.  Later on,  after  he
    had successfully obtained a right of abode and when Mr Mannan had  come
    back from Saudi Arabia, he then helped Mr Mannan with this application,
    and in particular by enabling Mr Mannan to go to  his  home  nearby  in
    Bangladesh and obtain copies of the documents pertaining to  Mr  Rashid
    that Mr Hoq had used, and that is why  we  have  them  here  before  us
    today.

16. So far as other documents are concerned, relied on by Mr Mannan,  while
    Mr Hoq said he suggested that Mr Mannan get them in the same  way  that
    he had done,  he  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  obtaining  of  those
    documents. He explained in his evidence that although Mr Hoq was in the
    process of making his application from 1993 onwards and had some  legal
    advice about it, he accepted he did not tell Mr Mannan about that,  but
    that is because he said he was in Saudi Arabia, but  it  was  later  on
    that he informed him of what had been happening with him and  what  the
    process was, and he said he was a long time in Saudi Arabia and I  have
    no reason to disbelieve that.  Mr Hoq had been able to produce his  own
    birth certificate which mentioned Mr Rashid for his application.   That
    showed that the birth was registered in 1972,  some  considerable  time
    before he made his application and in fact before his father had  died.



17. Overall, I consider that taken by itself, Mr Hoq was a witness of truth
    notwithstanding the imperfections or defects referred to above; and  as
    Mr Karim has pointed out this  is  not  a  question  of  Mr  Hoq  being
    inaccurate, if he was, by mistake.  The reality is that either  Mr  Hoq
    has come here to tell the truth, or he has come here  deliberately  and
    colluded with Mr Mannan to lie in order to support Mr Mannan's case,  a
    point which I should record was never put to him in  cross-examination.
    Moreover, if the latter was the case it would be done in the  knowledge
    that they did not in fact share the same father but  the  same  mother.
    On the assumption that the marriage certificate in respect of Ms  Nessa
    is genuine, and I cannot see why it is not,  then  as  I  have  already
    said, the likelihood they share the same mother is very  small,  in  my
    judgement.

18. Ms Dring in the course of her submissions  suggests  that  perhaps  the
    answer to that was that Ms Nessa was not the mother of either  of  them
    and that their mother was someone else, but in my judgement  that  goes
    so far into the realms of  speculation  that  I  can  discount  it.   I
    consider Mr Hoq has come here to tell the truth and not  to  present  a
    bogus case.  I agree that  the  lack  of  detail  of  the  biographical
    evidence from Mr Mannan himself is  an  impediment,  but  it  does  not
    matter if you accept the evidence of Mr Hoq, and that is so even though
    that detail was not put in his witness  statement  as  it  should  have
    been.  If you then add Mr Hoq's evidence the DNA findings and, and  the
    unlikelihood of Ms Nessa being the mother of both Mr Mannan and Mr Hoq,
    and stop there,  that  would  take  Mr  Mannan's  case  well  over  the
    threshold of a balance of probabilities. However  this  does  not  take
    account of the  documentary  evidence  which  may  either  help  or  on
    analysis hinder Mr Mannan's case, so I turn to that now.

19. Ms Dring helpfully divided the documents into  three  categories.   The
    first were the documents that referred to Mr Rashid alone.   Obviously,
    they do not directly show a link to Mr Mannan.  We know on the evidence
    how he got them and they were supplied by Mr Hoq.  The first  of  these
    is Mr Rashid's passport.  It was issued in 1962 and it is a fair  point
    to make that in the section which  refers  to  any  children,  that  is
    simply struck out, i.e. it is blank and  the  obvious  point  is  made,
    well, if he had two children why were they not referred to, and I agree
    that that is odd.  Secondly, there is the national identity  card  from
    the Ministry of Labour in Stepney permitting Mr Rashid to work here and
    that is dated 1954.  Thirdly, there is the underlying application  form
    which is from 1952.  None of them themselves of course assist Mr Mannan
    because they do not show any connection to him.  Indeed, Ms Dring makes
    the point that if he was here in 1952 and 1954 and  was  back  here  at
    some time from 1962 onwards, it could call into question whether he was
    actually back in Bangladesh in 1956 when Mr Mannan was supposed to have
    been born.  I take that point, although as he clearly travelled, and on
    the face of the documents  was  married  at  the  time  to  a  wife  in
    Bangladesh, it is quite possible he was going back and forth.

20. We then have Mr Rashid's marriage certificate to the lady who was  said
    to be his first wife,  Joymona  Banu.  She  is  later  referred  to  as
    "Joymona Bibi", but I do not consider there  is  anything  particularly
    problematic about that, as I understand that Bibi  can  be  used  as  a
    denomination for a wife.  Now here, there is only a copy that has  been
    made available and the copy was obtained on 28 February  2016  when  Mr
    Mannan's application was well under way, but what  this  document  does
    show is that the marriage took place on 4 July 1939.  If that is right,
    then this is the woman that Mr Hoq says was Mr Rashid's first wife  and
    Mr Mannan's mother.  Of course, Mr Hoq could be making all of this  up.
    The certificate itself could be a forgery or  bogus;  although  I  take
    that into account I do not think it very likely here.

21. One then goes to the death certificate which is dated  27  March  2016.
    The date of death is given as 22 April 1977  from  Mr  Rashid  and  the
    document records that the death was registered on 4 October 1998.  Now,
    on any view that is some  considerable  time  after  the  death  of  Mr
    Rashid, but if it was  registered  then,  this  was  before  Mr  Mannan
    applied for abode here.  Of course, again in theory it could be  bogus,
    but if so it is a bit odd to have recalled a registration date of 1998.
     One would have thought that if one was creating a  bogus  paper-trail,
    the date of registration would be much closer to the date of death.

22. I agree that otherwise this does not inherently help Mr Mannan because,
    of course, it does not give any connection to him, so I  then  turn  to
    the second category of documents which were the subject of  submissions
    by Ms Dring, those which show the names of Mr Rashid and Mr Mannan.

23. First, there is what is said to be a true copy of a  birth  certificate
    in relation to Mr Mannan which records that his father was  Haji  Abdul
    Rashid and the mother's name Joymona Bibi.  I  do  not  think  anything
    turns on the spelling of "Roshid" as opposed to "Rashid", and indeed Ms
    Dring did not make much of that particular discrepancy, if that is what
    it was. More importantly, this document shows that  not  only  was  the
    issue of the certificate or a copy made on 18 February  2016,  but  the
    birth itself was only registered on 18 February, so that is not  really
    of much help.  I do not know what evidence Mr Mannan might have had  to
    submit (if any) in  relation  to  his  father  in  order  to  get  that
    reference to him on the birth certificate.

24. Secondly, there is the national ID  card.   This  is  potentially  more
    useful because the date of issue was 6  August  2008,  although  it  is
    right to say that by then Mr Mannan had been applying because he  first
    started the process in 2002; but it is of some assistance.

25. Thirdly, there is the school leaving certificate. This was clearly only
    put together in 2016 because the certificate itself records Mr Mannan's
    present age as 59 years 11 months; so it is not a question  of  a  copy
    taken directly from some entry in a register or other document  from  a
    much earlier time.  From the original which I have been shown, it looks
    as if this is a standard document, save for  all  the  details  of  the
    individual and the parents and the dates which have to be inserted.  On
    any view this does not really add anything, even  if  it  is  accurate.
    There are simply the same references to Mr Rashid and Joymona,  but  it
    is possible that this is simply self-serving.

26. There is then Mr Mannan's own the marriage certificate.   Now,  a  copy
    here was obtained in 2016 from the register.  The  extract  shows  that
    the marriage took place  in  1975  on  28  October  and,  that  it  was
    registered contemporaneously on 4 November 1975, giving his age as  20,
    which would be about right. Now, if this is  a  genuine  document  then
    this is helpful because the original entry was made a  very  long  time
    before Mr Mannan was considering making an application here.

27. There is then the passport of Mr Mannan. This one, and it is not  clear
    if it was the first one, is dated 1 November 2015 and it does state  as
    his father's name "Mr Rashid" and the mother's name as "Joymona  Bibi".
    But again, this could be self-serving because he could have volunteered
    those details when obtaining that passport, and I am not provided  with
    any evidence as to say whether  parental  details  would  be  something
    investigated before the passport could be issued.

28. Pausing there, looking at those documents in the round and taking  into
    account the number of those documents, I consider that on balance  they
    do assist Mr Mannan somewhat.  However, it would not matter in terms of
    my conclusions even if they did not, because on any view the  documents
    do not hinder his case. The fact that there are some oddities with  the
    documents do not lead me to conclude  that  they  are  bogus  or  would
    otherwise damage the evidence which has already been put before  me  in
    support of the application, that is to say the DNA, the evidence of  Mr
    Hoq and the question about the age of Ms Nessa and the unlikelihood  of
    her being the shared mother. I  also  should  make  it  plain  that  in
    relation  to  the  oddities  which  have  been  pointed  out  in  those
    documents, I have considered that when making my overall assessment  of
    the truth or otherwise of Mr Hoq's evidence.

29. That just leaves a third category  of  other  documents.   Mr  Hoq  had
    testimony of villagers and the midwife who attended  his  birth  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.  Mr Mannan does not have the same  quality  of
    documents.  So  far  as  the  midwife  is  concerned,  that  is  hardly
    surprising since he was born 62  or  63  years  ago.   There  are  some
    limited documents so far as his character was concerned, both are dated
    from March 2016.  One is to certify that  Mr  Mannan,  the  son  of  Mr
    Rashid and Joymona Bibi was a permanent resident in this union and  had
    been personally known to him and his character was good, and then there
    is a similar document or reference provided as well from someone  else.



30. That is all the evidence before me and  I  have  already  indicated  my
    observations in relation to it.  In my judgement, having considered the
    totality of the evidence before me, but also having taken into  account
    what is not  before  me,  notwithstanding  some  imperfections  in  the
    evidence which are said to support his case, I am  of  the  clear  view
    that Mr Mannan has established on the balance of probabilities that  Mr
    Rashid is his father.  It is common ground and  must  therefore  follow
    that this application for judicial review will succeed.  I  am  greatly
    indebted to both Counsel for the excellence of their  oral  submissions
    and written submissions. [brief explanation of judgment for benefit  of
    Mr Hoq then followed].

31. On costs, I considered that the Claimant should receive only 60% of his
    costs since his success was largely due to the oral evidence  given  by
    Mr Hoq today, not previously set  out  in  any  witness  statement.  On
    assessment  I  take  the  view  that  the  starting  point  should   be
    �12,500.00.  60% of that on my calculation, is �7,500.00.  That is  the
    sum that I will award by way of costs.  That sum must be  paid  by  the
    Defendant in 28 days.
