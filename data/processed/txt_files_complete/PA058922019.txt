Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Although an anonymity direction was not  made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge,  the  appeal  involves  a  protection  claim.  Accordingly,   it   is
appropriate to make an anonymity direction. Unless and until a  tribunal  or
court directs otherwise, the Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of
these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member
of his family. This direction applies both  to  the  Appellant  and  to  the
Respondent.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND PRIOR TO THE HEARING

    1. By a decision promulgated on 18 November 2019,  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge NMK Lawrence dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the
       Respondent's decision dated 7 June 2019 refusing his protection  and
       human rights claims.


    2. The Appellant challenged Judge Lawrence's decision on  two  grounds.
       First, it was said that the Judge erred when finding the Appellant's
       claim to be at risk in his home area not to be credible.  Second, it
       was submitted that the Judge erred when finding that  the  Appellant
       could safely relocate to Kabul.

    3. On 30 January 2020, Designated First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Woodcraft
       refused permission to appeal in the following terms:


           "The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan.  He appealed against
           the refusal of asylum arguing that he was at  risk  upon  return
           from the Taliban.  The judge did not find the appellant to be  a
           credible witness, see [13] to  [22]  of  the  determination  and
           dismissed the appeal.
           The grounds of onward appeal disagree with the  judge's  adverse
           credibility and internal relocation findings  arguing  that  the
           judge only took one credibility  point  against  the  appellant.
           There is no merit in this ground.  That the judge did not accept
           some of the criticisms of the appellant's account  made  by  the
           respondent does not of itself mean that the account had then  to
           be accepted by the judge.  The inconsistency went to the core of
           the appellant's claim, how was he treated by  the  Taliban.   As
           the appellant's claimed ill treatment could not be accepted  the
           appeal itself fell away.   Contrary  to  what  is  said  in  the
           grounds, the judge did in fact take into account the evidence on
           internal relocation to Kabul.  At [25]  the  judge  pointed  out
           that Mr Foxley's report (paragraph 122) indicated  that  due  to
           the appellant's low profile the risk of return was significantly
           lower for the appellant in Kabul.
            The grounds do not demonstrate any arguable error of law on the
       judge's part."


    4. Following renewal of  the  application  for  permission  to  appeal,
       permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Mandalia on  2  March
       2020 in the following terms:


            "1.  The appellant, a national of Afghanistan, appealed against
           the respondent's decision of 7th June 2019 to  refuse  to  grant
           him asylum and/or humanitarian protection.  First-tier  Tribunal
           Judge NMK Lawrence dismissed the appeal for reasons set out in a
           decision promulgated on 18th November 2019.
            2.   It is at least arguable that in his assessment of the risk
           upon return and the question of internal relocation,  the  judge
           fails to give any or any  adequate  reasons  for  rejecting  the
           appellant's claim that he is not in contact with his  family  in
           Afghanistan.  As I grant permission on the second ground,  I  do
           not refuse permission on the first ground."


    5. By a Note and Directions sent on 29 April 2020, Upper Tribunal Judge
       C Lane indicated a provisional view that  the  error  of  law  issue
       could be determined on the  papers.   The  parties  were  given  the
       opportunity to provide written submissions on this course.   Neither
       party made any submissions.


    6. By a decision promulgated on 6 July 2020, Upper Tribunal Judge Coker
       found an error of law in Judge Lawrence's  decision.  She  therefore
       set aside the First-tier Tribunal decision and directed a  re-making
       at a remote hearing.  Judge Coker's reasons for finding an error  of
       law were as follows:


            "... 4.    The judge made  a  number  of  positive  credibility
           findings and found against the respondent's view on a number  of
           matters.  The judge refers to a  number  of  matters  not  being
           implausible.  The judge is required to do more than merely  find
           matters  not  implausible  -   findings   have   to   be   made,
           holistically,  and  the  weight  placed  by  the  judge  on  one
           inconsistency, in  the  context  of  the  other  matters  found,
           renders the decision infected  by  error  of  law,  particularly
           given the vulnerability of the appellant  at  the  time  of  the
           incidents that form the core of his claim and at the hearing.
            5.    The  issue  of  internal  relocation  is  not  adequately
           reasoned given the background evidence that was before  the  FtT
           judge, as subsequently confirmed by the later CG case.
            6.   I am satisfied the decision of the FtT judge should be set
           aside for error of law.
            7.   The appellant sought to have the appeal  remitted  to  the
           FtT with findings preserved.  The findings of the FtT  are  such
           that it is appropriate for the hearing  to  remain  in  the  UT;
           limited evidence is required."


    7. As I have recorded, Judge Coker's decision was made  on  the  papers
       without a hearing pursuant to rule  34  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  ("the  Procedure  Rules").   Since  the
       making of her decision, the Administrative Court has given  judgment
       in the case of  Joint  Council  for  the  Welfare  of  Immigrants  v
       President of the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) and
       Lord Chancellor [2020] EWHC 3103 (Admin).  In that case,  Fordham  J
       held that the Presidential guidance concerning the making  of  paper
       decisions during the Covid-19 pandemic was  unlawful  on  the  basis
       that it gave rise to an "overall  paper  norm".   The  Tribunal  was
       directed to inform those potentially affected by the judgment of  it
       and to give an opportunity for submissions to be made leading  to  a
       review of any decisions which fell within its ambit.  Although  that
       includes the present case, Mr Bradshaw for the  Appellant  confirmed
       that he takes no issue with Judge Coker's decision and does not seek
       to have that reviewed or set aside.  That is unsurprising since  the
       error of law decision was made in the Appellant's favour.   Although
       Mr Tufan indicated that the Respondent's position  would  have  been
       that there was no error of law  in  Judge  Lawrence's  decision,  he
       accepted that no submissions  had  been  made  arguing  against  the
       proposed  making  of  the  decision  on  the  papers  and  that   no
       application had been made since Fordham J's decision seeking to  set
       aside Judge Coker's decision on grounds of unfairness.


    8. The directions made by Judge Coker required  a  schedule  of  agreed
       findings of fact to be filed  no  later  than  21  days  before  the
       resumed hearing and skeleton arguments to be filed no later than  14
       days before the resumed hearing.   She  also  directed  that  either
       party could object to  the  appeal  being  determined  by  a  remote
       hearing within 14 days from the date her decision was sent.


    9. Following Judge Coker's  decision,  the  Appellant  was  obliged  to
       change solicitors as the firm previously representing him closed its
       legal aid department.  The Appellant's current  solicitors  informed
       the Tribunal that they were acting  by  e-mail  dated  10  September
       2020.  It appeared from that e-mail that, although  they  knew  that
       the appeal was listed for a resumed  hearing,  they  were  otherwise
       unaware of the direction permitting them to  object  to  the  appeal
       being determined via a  remote  hearing.   For  that  reason,  Upper
       Tribunal Judge Gill,  by  directions  given  on  21  September  2020
       extended time for objection to  be  made.   No  such  objection  was
       received.  By her directions, Judge Gill  also  confirmed  that  the
       remainder of Judge Coker's directions should stand.


DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE AND SUBMISSIONS


   10. On  26  January  2021,  the  Appellant's  solicitors  filed  further
       evidence with an application to adduce  that  evidence  pursuant  to
       rule 15(2A) of the  Procedure  Rules.   The  evidence  included  the
       Appellant's second supplementary  statement  dated  5  January  2021
       (which I refer to hereafter as "the Fourth  Witness  Statement"),  a
       statement from his brother ("SM")  also  dated  5  January  2021,  a
       Tribunal decision allowing SM's appeal and  a  statement  from  SM's
       friend, ("AM") dated 25 January 2021 as well as  evidence  from  the
       Appellant's college tutors.


   11.  By  a  letter  dated  5  February  2021,  the  Appellant's  current
       solicitors wrote to the Tribunal  indicating  that  they  wished  to
       adduce an updated report from Mr Tim  Foxley  who  had  provided  an
       expert report for the First-tier Tribunal hearing.  It appears  that
       no action was taken to obtain an updated report when the  solicitors
       were first instructed because it was considered that  the  situation
       in Afghanistan in 2020 was so fluid that any  updated  report  would
       quickly become obsolete.  The solicitors indicated that  they  would
       seek permission to adduce the updated report at the hearing  (as  to
       which see below).


   12. The solicitors also sought an extension of time to file the schedule
       of agreed findings of fact by 4pm on 12 February 2021  and  skeleton
       arguments by 2pm on  16  February  2021.   By  directions  dated  10
       February 2021, the Upper  Tribunal  lawyer  extended  time  for  the
       schedule of agreed findings of fact to 4pm on 12 February  2021  and
       for filing of skeleton arguments to 4pm on 15 February 2021.   Those
       were filed on 15 February 2021.


   13. In relation to the updated report of Mr Foxley, that was filed on 11
       February 2021 as part of a second application to adduce evidence.  I
       refer to Mr Foxley's second report hereafter as "the Updated  Expert
       Report".  In addition to the Updated Expert  Report,  the  Appellant
       also seeks permission pursuant to rule 15(2A) of the Procedure Rules
       to rely on further background evidence.


   14. In addition to the Updated Expert Report and additional evidence  to
       which I have referred above, I had before me a witness statement  of
       the  Appellant  dated  5  September   2017   ("the   First   Witness
       Statement"), the Appellant's bundle as it was before the  First-tier
       Tribunal  (referred  to  hereafter  as  [AB/xx])  which  includes  a
       statement of the Appellant dated 23 July 2019 ("the  Second  Witness
       Statement") and a supplementary statement of the Appellant  dated  8
       August 2019 ("the Third Witness Statement") and the first report  of
       Mr Foxley dated 9 October 2019 ("the Expert Report").   I  also  had
       the Respondent's bundle including the core documents.


   15. In relation to the applications to adduce evidence, the delay in the
       filing  of  evidence  is  said  to  be  the  difficulty  in   taking
       instructions and  contacting  the  witnesses  due  to  the  Covid-19
       pandemic, the various lockdowns and positive test results which have
       affected staff in the firm and which led to closure of  the  offices
       for four weeks with caseworkers unable to access files.  One of  the
       witnesses was also outside the UK until shortly before the filing of
       the evidence.  I have already referred to the reasons given for  the
       lateness of the Updated Expert Report.  Mr Tufan did not  object  to
       the admission of the additional evidence.  For reasons which I  will
       come to it was not necessary for me to  be  taken  to  much  of  the
       evidence.  I refer only to that which is relevant to  the  issues  I
       have to determine but I confirm that I have read and had  regard  to
       all the evidence.


THE HEARING - PROCEDURAL ISSUES


   16. The hearing before me was conducted  via  Skype  for  Business.  The
       Appellant and  SM  were  present,  and  a  Pashtu  interpreter  also
       attended to interpret their  evidence.   The  interpreter  confirmed
       that he could understand and was understood by the Appellant and SM.
        For reasons which I will come to, it was  only  necessary  to  hear
       from SM briefly.   There  were  some  minor  technical  difficulties
       experienced during the  giving  of  SM's  evidence  but  those  were
       overcome by questions and answers being repeated as necessary.   The
       representatives confirmed that they were able to follow the  hearing
       throughout.


   17. At the outset, I clarified with Mr Bradshaw what were the  issues  I
       had to determine.  Initially, those were stated to be:
                  a) The particular risk to the Appellant on return to  his
                     home area;
                  b) The general risk to the Appellant whether in his  home
                     area or in Kabul;
                  c) The reasonableness of internal relocation to Kabul.


   18. I also pointed out to both representatives that there  might  be  an
       issue of consistency between the Appellant's case and the case of SM
       as recorded in the Tribunal decision allowing his appeal.   However,
       when Mr Tufan was asked to clarify what of the facts included in the
       draft statement of facts could be agreed, he indicated that  he  was
       content to  take  the  Appellant's  claim  at  its  highest  on  the
       assumption that it was credible as he considered the material  issue
       to be whether the Appellant could reasonably be expected to relocate
       to Kabul to where he would be returned.  For  that  reason,  he  was
       content to agree the draft statement of facts.


   19. Mr Bradshaw expanded the draft statement of facts to a minor  extent
       by noting the Respondent's  concession  as  to  credibility  of  the
       Appellant's claim.  However, for that reason,  it  was  agreed  that
       oral evidence was not required to be taken from the Appellant.   His
       statements could stand as  read.   Mr  Bradshaw  asked  that  he  be
       permitted to ask SM a  few  questions  orally  in  relation  to  his
       ability to support the  Appellant  on  return.   I  agreed  to  that
       course.  I deal with SM's evidence below.

ISSUES AND LEGAL BACKGROUND


   20. In light of the Respondent's concession, the three issues identified
       above are narrowed to the general risk to the Appellant in Kabul and
       the reasonableness of internal relocation  to  that  place.   It  is
       accepted that the Appellant cannot return to his home area and I  do
       not therefore need to deal with that prospect.


   21. Article 15 of the Council Directive 2004/83/EC (the Qualification
       Directive) ("Article 15(c)") defines serious harm as including at
       Article 15(c) a "serious and individual threat to a civilian's life
       or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of
       international or internal armed conflict".   The reasonableness of
       internal relocation arises only if there is no real risk of serious
       harm in the area of relocation.  The burden to establish a real risk
       of serious harm is on the Appellant.

   22. The issues which remain are the subject of the  Tribunal's  decision
       in AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG [2020] UKUT 00130 (IAC)  ("AS
       (Afghanistan)").  The relevant guidance given is as follows:


           "Risk on return to Kabul from the Taliban
           (i)     A person who is of lower-level interest for the Taliban
           (i.e. not a senior government or security services official,  or
           a spy) is not at real risk of persecution from  the  Taliban  in
           Kabul.
            Risk of serious harm in Kabul
           (ii)   There  is  widespread  and  persistent  conflict-related
           violence in Kabul. However, the  proportion  of  the  population
           affected by indiscriminate violence is small and not at a  level
           where a returnee, even one with no family or other  network  and
           who has no experience living in Kabul, would face a serious  and
           individual  threat  to  their  life  or  person  by  reason   of
           indiscriminate violence.
            Reasonableness of internal relocation to Kabul
           (iii) Having regard to the security and humanitarian  situation
           in Kabul as well as the difficulties  faced  by  the  population
           living there (primarily the urban poor but also IDPs  and  other
           returnees, which are not  dissimilar  to  the  conditions  faced
           throughout many other parts of  Afghanistan)  it  will  not,  in
           general, be unreasonable or unduly harsh for a single adult male
           in good health to relocate to Kabul even if he does not have any
           specific connections or support network in Kabul and even if  he
           does not have a Tazkera.
           (iv) However, the particular  circumstances  of  an  individual
           applicant  must  be  taken  into  account  in  the  context   of
           conditions in the place of relocation, including a person's age,
           nature  and  quality   of   support   network/connections   with
           Kabul/Afghanistan, their physical and mental health,  and  their
           language,  education  and  vocational  skills  when  determining
           whether a person falls  within  the  general  position  set  out
           above. Given the limited options for employment,  capability  to
           undertake manual work may be relevant.
           (v)   A person with a support network or specific connections in
           Kabul is likely to be in a more advantageous position on return,
           which may counter a particular vulnerability of an individual on
           return. A person without a network may be able  to  develop  one
           following return. A person's familiarity with the  cultural  and
           societal norms of Afghanistan (which may be affected by the  age
           at which he left the country and his length of absence) will  be
           relevant to whether, and if so how quickly and successfully,  he
           will be able to build a network.
            Previous Country Guidance
           (vi) The   country   guidance   in AK   (Article    15(c))
           Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 163 (IAC) in relation  to  Article
           15(c) of the Qualification Directive remains unaffected by  this
           decision..."


   23. The test in relation to the reasonableness of internal relocation is
       found summarised and  discussed  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  its
       judgment relating  to  the  appeal  against  the  previous  Tribunal
       decision in AS (Afghanistan) at [61] to [68] ([2019] EWCA Civ  873).
       I have regard to the test as there discussed and articulated.  I  do
       not need to set that out.  In short, the question for me is whether,
       on a holistic assessment of the circumstances  which  the  Appellant
       would face on return to Kabul, it is reasonable and not unduly harsh
       for him to be removed there.


   24. As to the burden of proof which applies, I have regard  to  what  is
       said at [48] and [49] in AS (Afghanistan) as follows:


            "48. In  respect  of  whether  it  is  reasonable  for  him  to
           internally relocate, an evaluative and  holistic  assessment  is
           required, as explained  in  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
           Department v SC (Jamaica) [2017] EWCA Civ 2112 at  [36]  and  by
           the Upper Tribunal in MB(Internal relocation - burden of  proof)
           Albania [2019] UKUT 00392 (IAC) where it was stated:
                 The burden of proof remains on  the  appellant,  where  the
                 respondent has identified  the  location  to  which  it  is
                 asserted they could relocate, to prove  why  that  location
                 would  be  unduly  harsh,  in  line  with  AMM  and  others
                 (conflict; humanitarian crisis; returnees; FGM) Somalia  CG
                 [2011]  UKUT  445  (IAC),  but  within  that  burden,   the
                 evaluation  exercise  should  be  holistic.   An   holistic
                 approach to such  an  assessment  is  consistent  with  the
                 balance  sheet  approach  endorsed  later  in  SSHD  v   SC
                 (Jamaica) [2017] EWCA Civ  2112,  at  paragraphs  [40]  and
                 [41].  MM v Minister of Justice, Equality and  Law  Reform,
                 Ireland  (Common  European  Asylum   System   -   Directive
                 2004/83/EC) Case C-277/11 does not impose a burden  on  the
                 respondent or result in a formal sharing of the  burden  of
                 proof, but merely confirms a duty  of  cooperation  at  the
                 stage of assessment, for  example  the  production  of  the
                 country information reports.
            49.  We remind ourselves that, as stated in MB at [25]:
                 An over-emphasis on the overall burden of proof  can  be  a
                 distraction from that holistic assessment."


   25. Finally, I record that the Appellant accepts that no issue falls  to
       be determined in relation to his private and family life in  the  UK
       under Article 8 ECHR.  Mr Bradshaw expressly conceded that this  was
       not a ground of appeal and if the Appellant were  to  fail  in  this
       appeal, he would need to make further submissions to the  Respondent
       in that regard.


   26. With that framework firmly in mind, I turn to the relevant evidence.




AGREED FACTS AND ADDITIONAL FACTUAL EVIDENCE


   27. In light of the Respondent's position on the Appellant's  claim  (as
       set out at [18] above), I record the facts and issues as agreed:


            "..2.      The appellant in this matter is a 20-year-old  male,
           an Afghan national and Sunni Muslim.  His date of  birth  is  19
           July 2000.  The appellant was born and raised in Abkhul village,
           which is in Pul E Khumri district, Baghlan province.
            3.   The appellant lived in Abkhul with his mother, brother and
           sister, until his brother  left  Afghanistan.   The  appellant's
           father was associated with the Taliban and was killed in a  bomb
           blast when the appellant  was  approximately  6  years  of  age.
           Following  the  appellant's  father's  death,  the  family   was
           supported by the appellant's maternal uncle.
            4.   The appellant did not attend school  in  Afghanistan.   He
           speaks Pashto but cannot read or write in that language.  He has
           learned English in the United Kingdom and was able to sit GCSE's
           in May 2019.
            5.   After the death of the  appellant's  father,  the  Taliban
           sought  for  the  appellant's  brother  to   join   them.    The
           appellant's mother  feared  the  appellant's  brother  would  be
           successfully recruited, so, with the assistance of the  maternal
           uncle, the appellant's brother left Afghanistan to go to Europe.
            The Taliban then sought to recruit the  appellant  from  around
           one year before he left the country.  They attended his house on
           several occasions seeking to recruit him.
            6.   At the material time, the Taliban forcibly  recruited  and
           abducted children, generally, and  did  so  to  provide  suicide
           bombers.  The Taliban acted  with  persistence,  generally.   As
           such, the appellant's account of  abduction  and  the  Taliban's
           attempt to  use  him  as  a  suicide  bomber  is  plausible  and
           externally  consistent.   Further,  it  is  plausible  that  the
           Taliban acceded to the  appellant's  refusal  to  go  out  as  a
           suicide bomber and that he was escorted from the camp by a  cook
           who was the appellant's father's friend.  It is  also  plausible
           that  the  Taliban  failed  to  guard  the  appellant  properly,
           enabling him to escape.
            7.   The appellant's exit from Afghanistan was  facilitated  by
           his maternal uncle.  The appellant  left  around  April  or  May
           2015, along with 7 or 8 other  boys.   He  travelled  via  Iran,
           Turkey, Italy and France.  He did not claim asylum in  Italy  or
           France as he was under the control of an agent.   The  appellant
           arrived in the UK on 3 August 2016 and claimed asylum  the  same
           day.  He has been accommodated with a foster family  in  the  UK
           since September 2016.  The appellant  attended  his  substantive
           interview on 9 October 2017.  The respondent refused his  asylum
           claim on 7 June 2019.
            8.   ....
            9.   In August 2019, the British Red Cross confirmed  they  had
           located the appellant's mother and sister, but the appellant has
           been unable to reach them via the contact numbers he was  given.
           The appellant has, by chance, been able to re-establish  contact
           with his brother, who is in the UK.   Contact  between  them  is
           ongoing.
            10.  The appellant's brother has previously claimed  asylum  in
           the UK on the basis of attempted recruitment by the Taliban  and
           was found credible by Immigration Judge  Callender  Smith  in  a
           determination dated 24 January 2012.  The appellant's  brother's
           appeal was allowed on asylum and human rights  grounds.   Within
           his claim, the appellant's brother gives matching family history
           to that given by the appellant and also recounts their  father's
           earlier involvement with the Taliban."


   28. I need to make two observations about that statement of  the  facts.
       First, as regards [10], as I have already observed, the claims  made
       by SM and the Appellant are not  entirely  "matching"  as  asserted.
       The claim made by SM is not that the Taliban "attempted" to  recruit
       him as asserted in that paragraph but that they had done so  and  he
       had escaped (in other words, much the same account as is  now  given
       by the Appellant).  SM was asked to confirm this when he  gave  oral
       evidence before me and confirmed that  his  case  was  that  he  was
       detained by the Taliban but escaped.  That question and reply caused
       obvious consternation to Mr Bradshaw as it appeared to undermine the
       Respondent's  acceptance  of  the  credibility  of  the  Appellant's
       account.  I indicated however that it was my  understanding  of  the
       Respondent's position that, notwithstanding the discrepancy  between
       SM's and the Appellant's account as to SM's past, that had no impact
       on the credibility  of  the  Appellant's  account  as  to  what  had
       befallen him before he left Afghanistan.  Both representatives  were
       content with that position.


   29. Second, in those circumstances, and in  light  of  the  Respondent's
       concession, the Appellant's account as set out  above  is  accepted.
       In other words, it is accepted that:
                  a) The Appellant's father was  previously  involved  with
                     the Taliban and is now dead;
                  b) The Appellant was himself abducted by the  Taliban  to
                     serve as a suicide bomber, managed to escape and  fled
                     Afghanistan  thereafter,  assisted  by  his   maternal
                     uncle;
                  c)  The  Appellant's  mother   and   sister   remain   in
                     Afghanistan, in his home area but, although they  have
                     been traced, the Appellant has been unable to  contact
                     them;
                  d) The Appellant's  brother  SM  is  in  the  UK  and  is
                     entitled to remain as a refugee;
                  e) The Appellant left Afghanistan in 2015 when  he  would
                     have been aged a little under 15 years;
                  f)  The  Appellant  was  uneducated  in  Afghanistan  and
                     although he speaks some  Pashto,  he  cannot  read  or
                     write in that language;
                  g) The Appellant has been educated in the  UK  since  his
                     arrival in August 2016, has  learned  English  and  is
                     continuing his studies here.


   30.  As  indicated  above,  the  Respondent  having  proposed  that  the
       Appellant's case should be taken at its highest, there was  no  need
       for me to hear from him. His written statements are taken  as  read.
       I refer to those as necessary below.  I reiterate  the  Respondent's
       concession that, the Appellant's claim having been  accepted  to  be
       credible in relation to what happened to him in his  home  area  and
       therefore that the Appellant would be at risk there, the only  issue
       to be determined is whether there is a risk on return to  Kabul  and
       whether it is reasonable  to  expect  the  Appellant  to  internally
       relocate there.  If I conclude either that there is a risk on return
       to Kabul or that it is not reasonable to  expect  the  Appellant  to
       internally relocate  there,  then  he  is  entitled  to  succeed  on
       protection grounds.


   31. The Appellant deals with the prospect of  return  to  Kabul  in  the
       Second Witness Statement as follows:


            "..16.     I am unable to return and relocate within Kabul as I
           know that there is a lot of insurgency in Kabul from the Taliban
           with suicide bombings and Kabul itself  remains  unsafe.   Where
           would I return to?  Kabul is no longer safe.   There  are  daily
           attacks which I see in the media.  It  is  not  safe  for  those
           living in Kabul and I will be returned there."


   32. He expands on that position  in  the  Fourth  Witness  Statement  as
       follows:


            "..10.     I continue to fear my  life  and  cannot  return  to
           Afghanistan.  The Home Office considers Kabul to be safe for  me
           to return to.  I strongly disagree with this.
            11.  I see it in the media how Kabul as a city is insecure.  It
           is not safe.   There  are  always  spontaneous  random  acts  of
           violence in the capital city.  The Taliban do not have a base in
           the capital city but continue to target the city for their  acts
           of violence.  Kabul the city is vastly  different  to  villages.
           Kabul is modern and has developed  immensely.   It  is  seen  as
           westernised by the Taliban.  The Taliban  does  not  accept  the
           women leaving their houses without 'proper clothing' and without
           their heads/faces covered.  The women in  Kabul  are  much  more
           modern and wear  English  clothes.   The  Taliban  do  not  like
           children being in education and the  fact  that  media  channels
           streamed nationally in the country from Kabul portray them in  a
           bad light.   Therefore,  Taliban  target  Kabul  more  and  more
           frequently.  They do not state when they will commit an  act  of
           violence and randomly bomb the capital to prove their point, but
           reality is that they harm and kill innocent civilians.
            12.  I am presently studying  Access  to  Higher  Education  in
           Biology at Bourneville  College.  I  wish  to  study  Biomedical
           Science at undergraduate level in September 2021.  I  am  taught
           in English in the UK and speak Pashto.  If I were to be  removed
           to Kabul then I would be at a disadvantage with my education  as
           universities in Kabul are predominantly taught in Dari language,
           a language that I speak  truly  little  and  moreover  I  cannot
           read/write in Dari/Pashto.  There are universities in Kabul that
           do teach in English, but  reality  is  I  cannot  enrol  into  a
           university there as the qualifications I have obtained in school
           and further education from the UK will not be accepted there.  I
           will not be eligible to enrol at any university.
            13.  I will struggle to live  in  Kabul  alone.   There  is  an
           increase in small crimes throughout the city.  I  read  recently
           that someone was killed for a  mobile  phone.   The  looting  in
           Kabul  is  at  its  highest.   I  have  never  been  to   Kabul.
           Similarly, I had never been to Birmingham until I entered the UK
           but comparing Kabul and Birmingham  to  each  other  the  former
           remains unstable and dangerous compared to the  latter.   It  is
           wholly unfair for me to rely on my brother [SM]  to  support  me
           whilst he in the UK as given the present violence in Kabul I may
           not have a fixed address.  Also, if  I  was  to  be  removed  to
           Afghanistan the phoneline connection is not good and I can  lose
           contact with my brother again.  Something which I do not want.
            14.  Kabul's crime rate is at its  highest  and  the  terrorist
           acts by the Taliban are much more frequent and unplanned.   They
           target any area in Kabul they see fit.  In the chaos I could  be
           injured or harmed.  The SSHD is aware of this but continue their
           stance of returning me to war torn Afghanistan."


   33. I do not place much if any weight on what the Appellant  says  about
       the security situation in Kabul.  It is  clear  from  his  statement
       that his evidence is based only on media reports and  possibly  what
       he has been told by his expert.  The Appellant  has  never  been  to
       Kabul.  His brother has, so far as the evidence  shows,  never  been
       there  either  and,  in  any  event,  has  been  in  the  UK  for  a
       considerable period.  The Appellant does not have contact  with  any
       family members in Afghanistan and, so far as the evidence shows, has
       no family members in Kabul.


   34. I heard oral evidence from SM.  I have dealt above with  the  answer
       he gave in relation to his own claim but that is not something which
       need concern me for the reasons there given.


   35. In addition to that matter, SM confirmed that he had last spoken  to
       his mother and sister when he left Afghanistan about ten years  ago.
       He had tried to find them but could not.  He had tried to trace them
       through the Afghan communities in the  UK.   He  was  aware  of  the
       information emanating from the British Red Cross  via  his  brother,
       but they had been unable to contact the family in Afghanistan.


   36. SM was asked about  his  own  ability  to  provide  support  to  the
       Appellant  in  the  event  that  the  Appellant  were  returned   to
       Afghanistan.  SM said that he has his  own  business  but  that  has
       suffered during the lockdowns caused by the pandemic.  His shop  has
       been closed and he is struggling to pay his rent and other expenses.
        He said that he sometimes gives  the  Appellant  small  amounts  of
       money ("�10, �20, �30") but would be unable to provide  support  via
       money transfers to Afghanistan.  In  addition,  SM  intends  to  get
       married next year to a woman in the UK.  He says that thereafter  he
       will not be in a position to support the Appellant as he  will  need
       to support his own  family.   Mr  Tufan  sought  to  undermine  SM's
       evidence in this  regard  by  cross-examination.   However,  SM  was
       consistent in his answers and I accept his evidence that he  is  and
       would in  the  future  be  unable  to  provide  the  Appellant  with
       financial support were the Appellant to be returned to Afghanistan.

   37. The Appellant says in the Fourth Witness Statement (at �12 as  cited
       at [32] above) that he wishes to go on to study  Biomedical  Science
       at  University  later  this  year.   The  evidence  in  the  initial
       Appellant's bundle  about  his  educational  achievements  does  not
       necessarily reflect this as being a  realistic  ambition.   However,
       with the supplementary evidence to which I refer at [10] above,  the
       Appellant has included letters from tutors who  teach  him  now  and
       have taught him in the past.  There is a  document  confirming  that
       the Appellant is currently undertaking a course  entitled  "Level  3
       Access to  Higher  Education  Diploma  in  Science"  at  Bourneville
       College which is due to come to an end in July  2021.   There  is  a
       letter dated 22 October 2000 from Sarah Holmes who is  the  Head  of
       the School dealing with that programme which reads as follows:

           "[MIM] started at the college in  September  2017.   During  his
           first year at the college  I  taught  him  for  Enterprise,  and
           despite initial language difficulties, he persevered and  became
           a valuable member of the group.  He worked with other members of
           his team to set up an enterprise project to raise  money  for  a
           local  charity.   Although  often  quiet,  he  motivated   other
           students in his group to achieve the aims  of  the  project  and
           maximise the profits they made.
           [MIM] has worked his way up  and  is  now  studying  towards  an
           Access to Higher  Education  Diploma  in  Science,  where  I  am
           delighted to be teaching him  again.   He  is  approaching  this
           course with the same determination and perseverance as he showed
           when I first met him.  He has improved his English language  and
           academic skills considerably during this time, through hard work
           and diligence.  He now demonstrates all of the necessary  skills
           to succeed both at  university  and  in  his  chosen  career  of
           biomedical science.
           In the time that I have known him [MIM] has shown himself to  be
           a dedicated and committed young man.  Although things  have  not
           always been easy he works hard to overcome any difficulties  and
           always does this with a smile, whilst ensuring  that  his  peers
           (and teachers) are also doing well.   He  is  one  of  the  most
           caring and considerate students that I have the pleasure to work
           with.   He  has  shown  a  high   degree   of   resilience   and
           conscientiousness  and   has   made   excellent   use   of   the
           opportunities he has been given."


   38. That and the other evidence regarding  the  Appellant's  educational
       achievements paints a picture of a  determined  young  man  who  has
       persevered in the face of difficult  circumstances.   On  the  other
       hand, it also shows that the Appellant has  been  supported  in  his
       endeavours by his tutors.


   39. In  terms  of  the  other  support  from  which  the  Appellant  has
       benefitted since his arrival, he has been in the care of  [SB],  his
       foster mother.  She has provided a letter dated  23  July  2019  (at
       [AB/6-7]).  She provides a  great  deal  of  information  about  the
       Appellant's integration in the UK.  She speaks  of  the  Appellant's
       relationship with her two children; he is like an elder  brother  to
       them.  Although the Appellant did not do well academically at school
       (which is consistent with the other evidence about his  early  years
       in the UK), she confirms  that  he  is  now  "a  keen  learner"  and
       determined to do well in his education.


   40. [SB] also provides evidence about the Appellant's character both now
       and when he arrived in the UK.  That evidence is as follows:


           "..During these initial weeks [following his arrival in the UK],
           [MIM] struggled to settle.  At night [MIM] would sleep with  the
           light on, he was very afraid of the dark and was fearful for his
           safety  due  to  originally  being  placed  with  Men  in  Adult
           accommodation and the scary journey he had made to the UK.
            ...
           [MIM] is an  honest,  polite,  kind,  generous  and  very  well-
           mannered son.  He is always thinking of others and is  happy  to
           go the extra mile.  He has  a  very  strong  connection  to  his
           foster brothers and they both look up to him.  He makes  friends
           very easily as he is very approachable and  always  smiles.   He
           has  never  taken  anything  for  granted.   He   has   remained
           consistent the entire time he has spent with our family,  always
           abided by curfews, never late for appointments or  meetings  and
           happy to help around the home.  Since joining our family he  has
           thrived academically and has grown  into  a  responsible  caring
           respectful citizen.  He  is  very  disciplined,  grown  well  in
           confidence and takes pride in himself."


   41. Whilst that evidence is consistent with what is said by the  college
       tutors about the Appellant's resilience, it also suggests  that  the
       Appellant is used to following orders from others and that, if faced
       with extreme adversity, does become frightened (albeit  I  recognise
       that when he arrived in the UK, he was aged only just under 15 years
       and is now nearly 21 years).


BACKGROUND AND EXPERT EVIDENCE


   42. Mr Bradshaw confirmed my view that I do not need to have  regard  to
       the background evidence contained in the original Appellant's bundle
       as that pre-dates the guidance given in AS (Afghanistan).


   43. I have before me two reports of Mr Tim  Foxley,  the  Expert  Report
       dated 9 October 2019 and the Updated Expert Report dated 8  February
       2021.  Again, since Mr Foxley's  initial  report  pre-dates  the  AS
       (Afghanistan) guidance, and he has in any event updated his  opinion
       in the second report, I do not need to  have  regard  to  the  first
       report.


   44. In terms of his expertise, Mr Foxley has been  studying  Afghanistan
       since 2001.  He currently runs his own consultancy based in  Sweden,
       focussing on Afghanistan.  He is a research fellow with the European
       Foundation for South Asian Studies.  He  has  a  Masters  degree  in
       Peace and Conflict studies from Malmo  University,  specialising  in
       Afghanistan.  He has in the past completed temporary positions  with
       the UK Foreign Office and MOD as  an  analyst  and  researcher  into
       Afghan issues.  He was based in Kabul for several months in 2006 and
       2011 and has undertaken "several field trips and operational  tours"
       there since 2002.  Mr Foxley  has  provided  expert  evidence  in  a
       number of appeals involving Afghan asylum seekers  although  he  was
       not one of the experts  who  gave  evidence  at  either  of  the  AS
       (Afghanistan)  hearings.    I  am  satisfied  though  that  he   has
       appropriate expertise in relation to the issues dealt  with  in  his
       reports and that I can give weight to that evidence.


   45. As a starting point, Mr Foxley does not disagree with  the  guidance
       given in AS (Afghanistan).  At [31] of the Updated Expert Report  he
       summarises the change in the security situation in Kabul.   He  says
       that "[i]n the last year or so, the Taliban have reduced the  number
       of mass-casualty terrorist attacks in Kabul".  Although he  assesses
       that they retain the capability to conduct such  attacks,  he  notes
       that they have focussed on "targeted explosions and  assassinations"
       against "low,  middle  and  high  profile  male  and  female  Afghan
       citizens and government officials, including journalists, civil  and
       human rights activists, judges and doctors, as well as military  and
       police personnel".  In Mr Foxley's view, that change of approach may
       be a waiting game to judge what action the US will take in May  2021
       when US troops are due to be withdrawn.  Whatever  the  reason,  and
       although Mr Foxley points out that the Appellant might  be  at  risk
       from indiscriminate attacks from the Taliban and  other  groups,  he
       does not suggest that the Taliban  would  target  the  Appellant  in
       Kabul ([103]; [116]).  Mr Foxley does point out though that there is
       "a growing violent crime  wave  in  the  capital"  ([44])  but  that
       assessment is based on only one press article from October 2020  and
       is not supported by any statistical analysis.


   46. Although not at risk of targeted attack, Mr  Foxley  points  out  at
       [61] that, "as a young man with limited schooling, no experience  of
       the wider Afghanistan [sic] or operating as  an  independent  adult,
       [the Appellant] is likely to struggle  to  seek  assistance  and  to
       understand  and  respond  to  the  security   situation   or   other
       threatening situations as effectively as  fully  experienced  adults
       might".


   47. Dealing with the reasonableness of return in general, Mr Foxley also
       points at [52] to a November 2020 analysis which suggests  that  36%
       of the population of Afghanistan face  "high  level  of  acute  food
       insecurity".   He also there  notes  that  "[t]he  Corona  virus  is
       bringing  additional  pressure  to  bear  on  an  already   weakened
       healthcare system".


   48. In terms of return to Kabul in particular, Mr Foxley refers to three
       key challenges for "internally displaced Afghans" - lack of housing,
       access to  food,  and  unemployment  ([58]).   He  opines  that  the
       Appellant, with no support network in Kabul, would be  dependent  on
       assistance from the Afghan  government,  charities  and  NGOs  which
       support is "low and unreliable".


   49. I do not place weight on Mr Foxley's report of verbal  and  physical
       abuse of returnees at the  airport  as  that  stems  only  from  one
       article dating from 2017.  The other information given  directly  to
       Mr Foxley is  that  the  Appellant  would  be  unlikely  to  attract
       attention.


   50. In terms of the support which might be offered to the Appellant,  Mr
       Foxley notes  at  [59],  that  the  International  Organisation  for
       Migration   and   charities   provide   advice,    health    checks,
       transportation, training and funds.  There is a government run short-
       term reception facility but that offers only temporary  support  and
       accommodation.


   51. Mr Foxley also draws attention to the problems  of  trafficking  and
       forced labour to  which  returnees  in  particular  are  vulnerable.
       Whilst it appears from the  report  that  the  problem  is  a  long-
       standing one as the footnotes date back in some instances  to  2014,
       Mr Foxley refers to NGO reporting of an increase in  trafficking  to
       which returnees and internally displaced  persons  are  particularly
       vulnerable ([63]).  The trafficking includes exploitation  of  young
       workers "in appalling work  conditions".   The  Afghan  government's
       performance in tackling trafficking has been the comment of  a  USDS
       2020 report downgrading the country.


   52. Mr Foxley accepts that risks arising from "westernisation" are lower
       in Kabul.   As  Mr  Foxley  notes  at  [69],  "Kabul  is  relatively
       cosmopolitan" and therefore "Western clothes, mannerisms  and  style
       are more commonplace than in the rest of the  country".   There  may
       though be a risk of becoming a victim of crime  based  on  perceived
       wealth ([71]) (although I note that the source of that comment dates
       back as far as 2012).


   53. In terms of accommodation, Mr Foxley points out at [85] that most of
       the available housing amounts to "informal constructs" which are not
       well constructed and  do  not  have  official  position.   They  are
       described as "slums". The Afghan government is said to be trying  to
       address lack of housing by "formalising informal  settlements",  but
       progress is slow.


   54. In Mr Foxley's  view,  the  Appellant  would  only  have  access  to
       education if he was able to afford private  schooling  although  his
       support for that contention dates back  to  a  2015  report  ([88]).
       There is though said  to  be  a  low  quality  of  schooling  across
       Afghanistan due to destruction of infrastructure, limited  resources
       and a lack of qualified teachers.


   55. The already difficult employment situation is, unsurprisingly,  said
       to be worse at  the  moment  due  to  corona  virus.   There  is  no
       unemployment benefit as such.  If the Appellant could not find work,
       he would be dependent on charity.  Although there is an informal job
       market, that is said to be "plagued with numerous  problems  placing
       workers' health, safety and livelihoods at risks, such as  hazardous
       working environments, very  low  paying  jobs,  harassment  by  city
       management authorities, and a lack of job security" ([94] - footnote
       [160]).




FINDINGS OF FACT AND DISCUSSION


   56. Having regard to the guidance in AS  (Afghanistan)  (which  decision
       has now been upheld by the Court of Appeal), the  evidence  in  this
       case and the Respondent's concessions recorded  above,  I  make  the
       following findings:
           1) As conceded by the Respondent, the Appellant is  at  risk  in
              his home area and cannot return there (see [30] above).
           2) There is no real risk that the Appellant would be of interest
              to or targeted by the Taliban in Kabul (see [45] above).
           3) There is no real risk of serious harm in Kabul falling within
              Article 15(c) arising from  the  general  security  situation
              there. I can give little if any weight to the Appellant's own
              evidence in this regard as it is based on  media  reports  or
              possibly what he has been told by his  expert  ([33]  above).
              His  expert,  Mr  Foxley,  accepts  what  is   said   in   AS
              (Afghanistan).   If  anything,  the  view  expressed  in  the
              Updated Expert Report  is  that,  for  whatever  reason,  the
              position has slightly improved ([45] above).
           4) Whilst there may be some evidence of a growing violent  crime
              wave, that evidence is limited and does not  give  a  general
              picture of  the  situation  ([45]  above).  The  evidence  is
              insufficient to show any general real risk that the Appellant
              would come to harm.  The evidence of risk based on  perceived
              wealth as a returnee from the UK is similarly  limited  ([52]
              above).  In any event, any  such  assertion  is  inconsistent
              with the Appellant's case  that  he  would  be  destitute  on
              return due to his circumstances.


   57. Based on those findings, I conclude that there is no  real  risk  to
       the Appellant on return to Kabul.   I  therefore  turn  to  consider
       whether it is reasonable  to  expect  the  Appellant  to  internally
       relocate there.


   58. I accept that the Appellant will have no support from family members
       in Afghanistan.  I accept, as was conceded by the Respondent,  that,
       although the British Red Cross has managed to trace the  Appellant's
       mother and sister in Afghanistan, the Appellant  and  SM  have  been
       unable to make contact with them using the phone number given  ((�9)
       at [27] above).   In any event, so far as the  evidence  shows,  the
       Appellant's mother and sister remain in the Appellant's home area to
       where it is accepted that the Appellant cannot return.

   59. I accept SM's evidence that  he  would  be  unable  to  provide  the
       Appellant with financial support were the Appellant to  be  returned
       to Afghanistan ([36] above).  The Appellant has been living  with  a
       foster family since his arrival in the UK and remains  supported  by
       the authorities in the UK.  The financial support which SM has given
       the Appellant since they regained contact is in the form of  "pocket
       money" for incidental expenses and  is  not  day  to  day  financial
       support. SM is himself struggling due to the impact of the  pandemic
       on his business and will, in the near future, have his own family to
       support as he intends to marry next year.


   60. I accept, as conceded by the Respondent, that the Appellant does not
       read or write in Dari or Pashtu ((�4) at  [27]  and  (�12)  at  [32]
       above).  The Appellant's evidence in this regard was not  challenged
       by the Respondent.  The Appellant does however speak Pashtu and also
       speaks English.   That he has  been  able  to  learn  English  to  a
       standard which has permitted him to advance to the level he  has  in
       his education is not only to his credit but also shows  his  ability
       to adapt.  If he were returned to Afghanistan,  therefore,  I  would
       expect that he would be able to pick up the languages  spoken  there
       fairly readily.  SM gave his evidence in Pashtu and it was  expected
       that the Appellant would give evidence also in that language had  he
       given  evidence.   That  suggests  that  he   is   fluent   in   his
       understanding and communication of that language.

   61. I accept that it is highly unlikely that the Appellant would be able
       to proceed with his university ambitions, at least in the short-term
       following return.  Although the Appellant  accepts  that  there  are
       universities in Afghanistan which teach  in  English,  the  evidence
       suggests that he would be unlikely to be able to access either those
       universities or indeed those which  teach  in  Pashtu  or  Dari.  Mr
       Foxley says that the only education to which the Appellant might  be
       able to gain  access  would  be  private.   The  evidence  which  is
       unchallenged is that the universities in Afghanistan are unlikely to
       accept the qualifications gained in  the  UK.   In  any  event,  the
       Appellant would have to find some means to  support  himself  whilst
       studying.  That is not a problem which he faces in the UK.

   62. I do not accept however that the inability  to  progress  to  higher
       education  would  render  return   of   the   Appellant   to   Kabul
       unreasonable.  The unchallenged evidence is that the Appellant never
       went to school in Afghanistan.  Whilst the loss of the opportunities
       which he has been given in the UK would no  doubt  be  disappointing
       for him, he could have had no expectation of any education let alone
       higher education had he remained in Afghanistan.

   63. This brings me on, however, to what the Appellant would be  expected
       to do on return to Kabul.  I accept that he  would  have  access  to
       some temporary support in  the  form  of  short-term  financial  and
       accommodation assistance from NGOs and other organisations ([243] to
       [246]  of  AS  (Afghanistan;  see  also  [48]   and   [50]   above).
       Thereafter, however,  the  Appellant  would  be  left  to  fend  for
       himself.

   64. It is at that point that the obstacles facing the Appellant's return
       become more obvious.  He left Afghanistan as a child.  He has  never
       lived in Kabul.  There is no evidence that he has ever worked  there
       or indeed in his home village.  There is little to  no  evidence  of
       the Appellant's economic and cultural background.  All that is  said
       is that his father was a member of  the  Taliban.   The  family  was
       supported by an uncle.  There is  no  evidence  that  the  Appellant
       undertook any form of work prior to leaving Afghanistan.

   65. Moreover, the Appellant comes from a  village  in  Afghanistan.   He
       does not come from a city.  He has  lived  in  a  city  in  the  UK.
       However, as he says in the Fourth Witness  Statement  (at  (�13)  at
       [32] above), life in Birmingham is a far cry from life in Kabul.

   66. As Mr Foxley points out, as a young man who left  Afghanistan  as  a
       child, the Appellant will not know how society operates (see extract
       from report cited at [46] above).  Whilst I do not accept (as I have
       already found) that the general security situation  or  violence  in
       Kabul is such as to put the Appellant at real risk on return  there,
       I do accept that it is relevant to the question of reasonableness of
       return for a young  man  with  no  understanding  of  how  to  avoid
       threatening situations.

   67. In terms of  employment,  without  connections  "stable  and  secure
       employment would be virtually impossible to  obtain"  ([234]  of  AS
       (Afghanistan)).  The Appellant does not have  connections,  and  nor
       does it appear  from  the  evidence  that  he  has  a  taskera.   As
       indicated by the guidance in AS (Afghanistan) at [234] to [236]  and
       [239] therefore, the Appellant would only be able to find employment
       in the informal job market.  He  would  then  be  at  the  mercy  of
       unscrupulous employers who look to exploit  returnees,  particularly
       young workers ([51] and [55] above).

   68. I accept that the evidence shows that the Appellant is a  personable
       young man who is determined and resolute  in  the  pursuing  of  his
       ambitions in this country which might be thought to  assist  him  in
       obtaining the sort of manual, unskilled labour which is available in
       Kabul informally.  However, in this country he has had support.   He
       is used to being guided by others, be it his foster  mother  or  his
       tutors.

   69. True it is that the Appellant faced a difficult and arduous  journey
       to reach the UK.  Again, that shows his resilience.   However,  even
       then, he was with others of his age and assisted  (if  that  is  the
       right word) by an agent.  He was not on his own,  left  to  his  own
       devices, in a strange city of which he has no previous knowledge and
       with no understanding of what to do to get by.  As I note above,  Mr
       Foxley's evidence is that persons in this position are  particularly
       vulnerable to exploitation ([51]  and  [55]  above).   Further,  the
       Appellant has no work experience whether in the UK or Afghanistan to
       "present himself in a way that would attract employers" ([236] of AS
       (Afghanistan))


   70. I accept that  there  is  available  accommodation  in  Afghanistan,
       albeit of very poor quality ([231] to [233] of AS (Afghanistan)  and
       [53] above).  However, I return to the points made about  employment
       above.  The Appellant has no-one to guide  him  or  to  turn  to  in
       Kabul.  He has never lived there.  He left Afghanistan  at  a  young
       age.  He would find it extremely difficult to find accommodation  by
       himself.  Furthermore,  he  would  need  some  means  to  fund  such
       accommodation in the longer term.

   71. Fortunately, the Appellant has not  been  scarred  by  his  previous
       experiences to the extent  of  developing  mental  health  problems.
       According to the evidence, he has neither mental nor physical health
       problems which would increase his difficulties on return.   However,
       the statement from [SB] (the  Appellant's  foster  mother)  suggests
       that the Appellant was traumatised when he first arrived in  the  UK
       ([40] above).  He is now an adult whereas he was then a child.  I do
       not place much weight on the evidence of the Appellant's  trauma  on
       arrival with his  foster  mother  but  it  does  indicate  that  the
       Appellant  is  perhaps  not  as  resilient  as  the  evidence  might
       otherwise suggest.

   72. I have to carry out a holistic assessment of all the  circumstances.
       There is no one factor  which  carries  the  day.   However,  as  is
       indicated at (v) of the headnote in AS  (Afghanistan),  "familiarity
       with the cultural and societal norms"  is  a  relevant  factor  when
       assessing reasonableness of relocation to Kabul for  those  with  no
       support  network  or  connections  in  that  place.   That  lack  of
       familiarity may arise, as here, because of the age the Appellant was
       when he  left  Afghanistan.   Although  the  evidence  is  that  the
       Appellant is a fairly resilient young man, he is able to be so  with
       the support which he has in  the  UK.   Faced  with  the  unfamiliar
       territory of a city which he does not know,  and  with  the  extreme
       difficulties  which  he  would  face  in  obtaining  employment  and
       accommodation there with no support, I am (just) persuaded  that  it
       is not reasonable to expect the Appellant to internally relocate  to
       Kabul.  It would be unduly harsh to return him to that  place.   For
       that reason,  the  Appellant  succeeds  on  Refugee  Convention  and
       Article 3 ECHR grounds.


    DECISION
    I allow the appeal on protection (Refugee Convention) and human  rights
    (Article 3 ECHR) grounds.
