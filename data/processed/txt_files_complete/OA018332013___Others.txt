For the Respondent:    Miss A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS



The History of the Appeal

1.   The Appellants are a mother and her  three  children  from  Bangladesh.
    One of the children, who is the fourth  Appellant,  appeals  against  a
    decision of the Respondent of 1 September 2013 refusing an  application
    for a certificate of entitlement to the right of abode in the UK.   The
    other Appellants appeal against  decisions  of  the  Respondent  of  21
    November 2012 refusing their application for entry clearance to the  UK
    as the wife and children of  their  husband  and  father  as  a  person
    present and settled in the UK.

2.   The appeal was heard by Judge Howard sitting  at  Hatton  Cross  on  28
    July 2014.  The Appellants were represented by  Mr  L  Youssefzan,  who
    appeared before me.  In a determination promulgated on 22  August  2014
    the appeals of the first, second and third Appellants  were  dismissed,
    whilst that of the fourth Appellant was allowed.

3.   Permission to appeal was refused by Judge Davies  on  20  October  2014
    and granted to the first to third Appellants on second  application  by
    Judge Goldstein on 12 February 2014 in the following terms:

         "1.  The renewed grounds amplify but  otherwise  continue  to  rely
             upon the original grounds submitted in support  of  the  first
             application for permission to appeal, and also  challenge  the
             reasoning of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  who  refused  such
             permission.

         2.   I am  persuaded  that  it  is  arguable  that  the  First-tier
             Tribunal, may have made an error of law  in  failing  to  give
             adequate reasons for its findings on material matters:  failed
             to resolve the issue as to whether  the  Respondent's  refusal
             under paragraph 320(7A) was appropriate, not least in light of
             the concession made at  the  hearing;  that  in  turn,  raises
             arguable  issues  as  to  whether  the  First-tier  Judge  was
             entitled in law to reach the conclusions that he did  for  the
             reasons given.

         3.   Further the First-tier Judge may have made  mistakes  of  fact
             about matters arguably relevant to this appeal.

         4.   In the circumstances permission is granted in respect  of  all
             of the grounds."

4.   In a Rule 24 response of 20 February  2015  the  Respondent  submitted,
    without access to the evidence, that Judge Howard had directed  himself
    appropriately.

5.   The Sponsor attended the error of law hearing before me.  Parts of  the
    proceedings were interpreted to him by somebody  who  accompanied  him.
    The hearing took the form of  submissions,  which  I  have  taken  into
    account, together with the grounds for permission  to  appeal  and  the
    Rule 24 response.   I  reserved  my  determination,  on  the  basis  of
    deciding whether the decision contained a material error of law and, in
    that event, with the  assent  of  both  representatives,  remaking  the
    decision.



Error of Law

6.   Mr Youssefzan and Miss Everett took  the  opportunity  to  discuss  the
    appeal before the start of the hearing.  In  consequence  Miss  Everett
    said that she confined her defence of the decision of Judge  Howard  to
    one issue.  Although the grounds for permission to appeal  are  lengthy
    and detailed, Mr Youssefzan moulded his submissions accordingly  and  I
    determine the application in that light.

7.    At  paragraph  16  of  his  decision  Judge  Howard  wrote  that   the
    maintenance requirements needed to embrace the  fourth  Appellant.   Mr
    Youssefzan  submitted  that  this  was  legally  incorrect.   When  the
    decision was made on 21 November 2012 in relation to  the  three  other
    Appellants, the application of the fourth Appellant was still  pending,
    and so remained until 1 September 2013.  Section 85(5) of the 2002  Act
    required the Tribunal  to  take  into  account  only  evidence  of  the
    position at the date of the decision on 21  November  2012.   I  accept
    this  submission,  whose  significance  is  that  it  feeds  into   the
    assessment of the adequacy of maintenance.

8.   In the fourth indented paragraph of the decision  in  relation  to  the
    third Appellant, who is the mother, of 21 November 2012, the Respondent
    identified weekly deductions of �100 for rent and �66 for council  tax.
    In a letter of 10 June 2013 the  third  Appellant  explained  that  the
    council tax was in fact �88 per  month.   Mr  Youssefzan  said  at  the
    hearing that this equated to around �20.38 per week, before  a  council
    tax deduction.  On that basis a schedule of  weekly  expenditure  which
    was in evidence before  Judge  Howard  discloses,  as  amended  at  the
    hearing, a net surplus of �91.15 per week.

9.   A letter from HMRC showed the gross  income  of  the  Sponsor  for  the
    financial year 2012/2013 as �12,024.  At paragraphs  4  and  5  of  his
    statement the Sponsor explained how this was mistaken  and  his  income
    for that period was in fact �20,350.   This  is  substantiated  by  his
    payslips and his statements of Halifax Bank, which correspond with  the
    payslips, for that period.

10.  Judge Howard addressed the inconsistency at paragraph  19.   He  stated
    that it was not easy to reconcile the two figures.  Both could  not  be
    right, and he must use the more reliable figure, which was one actually
    submitted to HMRC.  This he did.

11.  At the error  of  law  hearing  Miss  Everett  submitted  that  he  was
    entitled so to do,  and  thus  did  not  err  in  law.   Mr  Youssefzan
    submitted that in so doing he had not referred  to  or  considered  the
    evidence, both oral and written, of the Sponsor, nor  the  payslips  or
    Halifax bank statements.  Had he done so, he could not reasonably  have
    concluded from the evidence that  the  figure  submitted  to  HMRC  and
    utilised by them was the  more  reliable  one.   His  failure  to  take
    relevant evidence into account was an error of law.  This  I  so  find.
    As it happens, the submission is vindicated by a postdecision letter of
    2 October 2014 from HMRC which  Mr  Youssefzan  handed  to  me  at  the
    hearing showing the Sponsor's amended earnings for the  year  2012/2013
    as �20,350.  Whilst noting this I do not take it into account.

12.   The  judge  incorporated  the  fourth  child  into   the   maintenance
    calculation, overcalculated the council tax liability and  through  not
    taking account  of  relevant  evidence  undercalculated  the  Sponsor's
    earnings.  The combination of these errors led him to conclude that the
    surplus was insufficient to enable the Sponsor to maintain his  family.
    If these errors are corrected, the conclusion would have been that  the
    Sponsor had demonstrated his ability to do so.

13.  I accordingly set the determination aside in relation to the  first  to
    third Appellants.

Remaking the Decision

14.  It follows that, satisfying the  maintenance  requirements,  which  are
    the only limb of the permission application  to  which  the  Respondent
    maintained opposition, the first to third  Appellants  have  discharged
    the burden of showing their ability to maintain  themselves  adequately
    at the date of the  decision.   I  accordingly  substitute  a  decision
    allowing the appeals of the first to third Appellants.

Decision

15.  The original determination contained an error of law.  In  relation  to
    the first, second and third Appellants I set it aside.  In relation  to
    the fourth Appellant, whose appeal it allows, I preserve it.

16.  In relation to the first, second and third Appellants  I  substitute  a
    decision allowing the appeals.

17.  No anonymity direction is made.

18.  As fees have been paid, I make full fee awards in favour of the  first,
    second and third Appellants.
