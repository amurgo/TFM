                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Bannerman promulgated on 5 November 2019,  allowing
    on humanitarian protection grounds only the claimant's  appeal  against
    the decision of the Secretary of State, dated 8 August 2019, to  refuse
    his protection claim made on 5 December 2016.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Grant  granted  permission  to  appeal  on  9
    December 2019.

Error of Law

 3. For the reasons set out below I find there was an error of law  in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as to require it
    to be set aside and I remake the decision in the appeal  by  dismissing
    the claimant's appeal.

 4. Judge Bannerman accepted the claimant's factual claim to have been  the
    director of a short film depicting a fictional kidnapping of a woman by
    a terrorist group but rejected the claim that  it  had  been  shown  to
    hundreds of people, or that in consequence of that or any other  reason
    ISIS or others raided his home, or that he had for any such  reason  to
    flee  Iraq.   Neither  did  the  judge  accept  that  there   was   any
    longstanding family feud or threat of honour killing made  against  him
    as claimed.  I note that there has been no cross-appeal against any  of
    these findings and facts and therefore they must stand as made.

 5. Contrary to what appears in the screening interview, the judge accepted
    that the appellant had not stated that he had an ID card in the UK  and
    the judge found that at that time he did not have direct  contact  with
    his family in Iraq.

 6. At paragraph 84 of the decision the judge stated of the  appellant  "He
    has not made any genuine attempt to get a CSID card it appears,  and  I
    take this into account".  There is a confusing sentence at paragraph 85
    of the decision where the judge stated, "Returning to Iraq in the  case
    of AA, he does from have a CSID card or a passport and I  do  not  find
    that he can reasonable obtain one ...".  It may well be that the  judge
    intended to find that the claimant does not have a CSID card but it  is
    not entirely clear.  Mr Aziz submitted that it was an unfortunate  typo
    and I am inclined to agree.  However, the judge went on within the same
    paragraph to find that the claimant does not have family in Baghdad and
    that his family are in the Kurdish area (IKR).  As a Kurd he  would  be
    returning as a member of a minority community  without  a  sponsor  and
    would have no support on returning into Baghdad.

 7. At paragraph 86 the judge accepted that the claimant does  not  at  the
    present time have any form of documentation or  means  to  obtain  them
    through the civil registry in Baghdad.   More  significantly,  however,
    the judge pointed out in the same paragraph that there was no  evidence
    of any attempt by him to obtain a CSID in the UK.   Despite  that,  the
    judge found that his civil registry will be in  the  Kurdish  area  but
    that he does not at the moment have any family members who  can  assist
    him in obtaining documentation.  I confess that  I  do  not  understand
    that finding when there was no attempt  to  obtain  documentation.   At
    paragraph 87, the judge found that he would have to return via  Baghdad
    and although he is not a known ISIS associate or returning to  an  ISIS
    area he is a single man of fighting age.  For those  apparent  reasons,
    the judge concluded at paragraph 88 that  for  humanitarian  protection
    reasons the claimant would be unable to  safely  return  and  therefore
    allowed the appeal.

 8. In summary, the grounds assert that the judge's findings on  the  issue
    of availability of  a  CSID  card  are  contradictory  and  effectively
    irrational.  It is said to be irrational for the judge to find that the
    appellant cannot reasonably obtain a CSID on return whilst  finding  he
    has made no genuine attempt to  obtain  one:  "The  appellant  has  not
    demonstrated that the outcome of any genuine attempt would be fruitless
    and therefore could not obtain a CSID prior to or on return to Iraq".

 9. In granting permission, Judge Grant considered  it  arguable  that  the
    judge erred in finding that the appellant cannot  reasonably  obtain  a
    CSID on return to Iraq whilst at the same time finding that he has made
    no genuine attempt to obtain  one.   "The  findings  are  arguably  not
    reconcilable and amount to an arguable error of law which  is  material
    to the outcome of the appeal".

10. Even if the claimant does not presently have a CSID, it is  clear  that
    he has family in Iraq either in Kirkuk or within the IKR.   Bearing  in
    mind that ISIS is no longer in control of  the  Kirkuk  area  which  is
    relatively close in travelling distance  to  the  IKR  (less  than  120
    kilometres) there appears to be no reason  why  the  claimant's  family
    cannot assist him with providing or obtaining the necessary volume  and
    page number of the family book to enable him to renew  or  replace  his
    missing CSID, either from an Iraqi consulate  in  the  UK,  or  shortly
    after return to Iraq and the IKR.  If necessary, they could  travel  to
    the IKR to assist him to do that.  As the judge found that the claimant
    had made no genuine effort to obtain a CSID, I accept and find that  it
    was irrational and unreasonable for the judge to conclude that he would
    not be able to obtain  the  necessary  identification  document  on  or
    before returning to Iraq.

11. There are other difficulties with this decision.  Although the  refusal
    decision stated at paragraph 62 that the claimant was from  Kirkuk  and
    would be returned there via Baghdad and Sulaymaniyah (which is  in  the
    IKR) it was the appellant's case and the judge appears  to  have  found
    that he was living within the IKR at the time he decided to leave Iraq.
     He claims to have fled from there to Kirkuk from where he made his way
    out of Iraq and to the UK.  As he emanates from  the  IKR,  it  follows
    that he can be returned there directly and does  not  have  to  transit
    Baghdad.  The judge was informed by the respondent's representative  at
    the hearing, and provided with documentary evidence  in  support,  that
    direct flights to Erbil and Sulaymaniyah have resumed.  It follows that
    the claimant did not need to return via Baghdad at  all;  the  decision
    proceeded on an incorrect factual basis.  The judge  erred  in  law  in
    failing to explain whether this evidence of the availability of  direct
    flights was accepted, and if not why not.

12. On  the  evidence  that  was  available  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    confirmed in the recent country guidance of  SMO,  KSP  &  IM  (Article
    15(c); identity documents) Iraq CG [2019]  UKUT  0400  (IAC),  although
    promulgated after the First-tier Tribunal decision, it remains the case
    that the claimant can be returned directly to the IKR  without  needing
    to transit Baghdad, as  the  respondent  contended  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal appeal hearing.  In the light of the judge's factual findings,
    I am satisfied that even if he is not presently in direct contact  with
    his family, there is no good reason why he cannot make  contact  either
    from the UK or shortly after arrival in the IKR. In the  circumstances,
    I am satisfied that  the  claimant  will  have  available  to  him  the
    assistance of his family to provide the necessary information to obtain
    a CSID, either while still in  the  UK  from  an  Iraqi  consulate,  or
    shortly after arriving in the IKR from the civil registry.   Given  the
    availability of assistance from his  family,  it  is  the  respondent's
    case,  and  I  so  find,  that  return  will  be  feasible.   With  the
    information that his family can provide, he  will  be  able  to  obtain
    either a passport or a laissez passer which will allow him to  land  in
    the IKR.  SMO states that the laissez passer is confiscated on arrival,
    but that will not prevent the claimant from gaining entry to the IKR in
    the first place, as the Country Guidance available  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal explained.

13. In all the circumstances, I find that the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal contains such error of law that it cannot stand and has to  be
    set aside.  In setting it aside I preserve the findings of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal rejecting the factual claim  of  the  claimant  including
    that there is no family dispute to prevent him getting in contact  with
    his family members. It is not clear to me whether  his  family  are  in
    Kirkuk or the IKR.  It seems to have been assumed in the hearing before
    me that they are within the IKR, if so then it will  be  all  the  more
    easier to make contact with them. There is no reason for him not to  do
    so and nothing preventing  him  from  doing  so.   In  SMO,  the  Upper
    Tribunal pointed out that given the importance of  the  document,  most
    Iraqis will have memorised and know the page number and  volume  number
    of their CSID document.  Even if the claimant does not  have  his  CSID
    document information at the present time, I am  satisfied  that  it  is
    perfectly reasonable to expect him to make contact with his family  and
    to obtain the necessary information in order for him to renew his  CSID
    in the UK or at the very latest shortly  after  arriving  in  the  IKR.
    With  family  support,  with  a  CSID  card,  and  given  his  personal
    circumstances, there is no reason why the claimant would not be able to
    settle and integrate in the IKR. Whilst there is  a  high  unemployment
    the claimant is fit and healthy and able to work.  He will have  family
    support.  Given the assistance of return funds of up to �1,500 he  will
    be able to afford  accommodation  and  maintain  himself  even  without
    family assistance for several months and will  not  need  to  access  a
    critical shelter facility or an IDP camp.

14. In all the circumstances it is clear that this appeal cannot succeed on
    any grounds.  The asylum and Article 8 grounds  were  rejected  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal and there has been no  cross-appeal  against  those
    findings.

15. Considering the assistance that the  claimant  is  likely  to  have  on
    return  I  am  satisfied  that  the  appeal  cannot  succeed   on   the
    humanitarian protection grounds either or on Articles 2, 3 or 8 of  the
    ECHR.

16. In all the circumstances this appeal must be dismissed.

Notice of Decision

17. The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law such as to require the decision to
    be set aside.

18. I set aside the decision.

19. I remake the decision in the appeal by dismissing it  for  the  reasons
    set out above.
