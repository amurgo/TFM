For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms E Harris instructed by Nag Law Solicitors


                            REMITTAL AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698) I make an anonymity  order  on  the  basis  of  the
    respondent/claimant's circumstances.   Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or
    Court directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings shall  directly
    or indirectly identify the claimant.  This direction  applies  to  both
    the claimant and to the respondent and a failure to  comply  with  this
    direction could lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.

Introduction

 2. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge M Whitcombe) allowing AAMR's appeal  against
    a decision to remove him dated 7 November 2014 following the refusal to
    grant him asylum, humanitarian protection or leave under the ECHR.

 3. For convenience, I will refer to the respondent in this appeal  as  the
    "claimant" hereafter.

 4. The claimant is a citizen of Sri Lanka who was born on 31 January 1988.
     He is of Tamil ethnicity.  He claims to have arrived in the  UK  on  7
    February 2011.  However, he did not claim  asylum  until  30  September
    2014.  The basis of his claim was that his brother  and  brother-in-law
    were suspected by the Sri Lankan government  of  involvement  with  the
    LTTE.  His brother had been arrested and questioned in  September  2008
    and June 2009 but was released and had subsequently come to the UK.

 5. The claimant's case is that he was arrested on 30 August  2011  at  his
    parents' home by the Sri Lankan authorities.  They were looking for his
    brother.  The claimant was interrogated and asked about his brother and
    his brother-in-law whom they alleged was an intelligence officer in the
    LTTE.  The claimant was accused of passing information to him.   During
    his detention the claimant was physically abused  suffering  scars  and
    was also sexually abused.  After 2 � months in detention, the  claimant
    was released without conditions after his  family  paid  a  substantial
    bribe to secure his release.  Having received treatment in hospital for
    his injuries, the claimant shortly after obtained a student visa to the
    UK where he arrived on 7 February 2011.

 6. The Secretary of  State  rejected  the  claimant's  account  and  that,
    therefore, he would be at risk on return to Sri Lanka.   The  Secretary
    of State's reasons are set out in her decision letter dated 7  November
    2014.

Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 7. The claimant appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   At  the  hearing
    before the FtT, the claimant and his brother gave  oral  evidence.   In
    addition, the claimant relied upon a medical report dated 2 March  2015
    from Mr  M  Andrew  Mason,  a  Specialist  in  Accident  and  Emergency
    Medicine.  In addition, the claimant relied upon a summons  and  arrest
    warrant issued (he said) by the Batticaloa Magistrates' Court requiring
    the claimant to appear on 15 August 2014.

 8. Judge Whitcombe found the claimant to be credible.  He referred to  the
    expert report which, he noted, stated that the claimant's scarring  was
    "consistent" (and in  some  instances  "highly  consistent")  with  the
    claimant's account.

 9. In respect of the  summons  and  arrest  warrant  relied  upon  by  the
    claimant, the  Secretary  of  State  placed  into  evidence  (after  an
    adjournment to  obtain  them)  two  document  verification  reports  in
    respect of the summons and arrest warrant  obtained  from  the  British
    High Commission in Colombo prepared by an  officer  there  following  a
    faxed request to the Registrar of the Batticaloa Magistrates' Court and
    a telephone response from the Acting Registrar on 26 May  2015.   Those
    documents  stated  that  the  arrest  warrant  and  summons  were  "not
    genuine".  Nevertheless, the Judge considered that  there  were  "clear
    and worrying defects" in the verification reports and a certain lack of
    care in their preparation which undermined their probative value.  As a
    result, the Judge stated that he was:

         "... prepared to give the summons and arrest warrant  some  limited
         weight.  I give the Appellant the benefit of the doubt."

10. On the basis that the Judge accepted the claimant's account  concerning
    his arrest and detention and that of  his  brother  and,  additionally,
    taking into account that there was an extant warrant for his arrest, at
    paragraphs 45 and 55 the Judge found that the claimant fell within  the
    risk category in paragraph 7(a) of the Country Guidance decision of  GJ
    (Post-civil War: Returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013] UKUT 00319 (IAC).   The
    Judge also concluded that the claimant was at risk on return because he
    fell within the risk category in paragraph 7(d) of the head-note in  GJ
    because, given the extant arrest warrant, he would be on a "stop  list"
    and would be arrested at the airport.

11. As a consequence, the Judge allowed the  claimant's  appeal  on  asylum
    grounds and under Article 3 of the ECHR.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

12. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal  on  three  grounds.
    On 6 October 2015, the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Grant-Hutchinson)
    granted the Secretary of State permission to appeal on those grounds in
    the following terms:

         "It is arguable that the Judge erred in law  (a)  by  committing  a
         procedural irregularity capable of making a material difference  to
         the outcome and procedural fairness of the proceedings  by  placing
         little weight on inconsistencies not put to the Appellant in cross-
         examination when it is for the Judge to consider all  the  evidence
         particularly when  the  Appellant  had  made  a  witness  statement
         dealing with the reasons for refusal letter where he did not  rebut
         some of the points made; (b) by failing to  give  adequate  reasons
         why the expert  content  of  the  verification  reports  should  be
         discounted and (c) by finding that the Appellant was perceive to be
         a threat to the integrity of Sri Lanka  without  precisely  stating
         why the Sri Lankan  authorities  perceive  the  Appellant  in  that
         matter without taking into account the categories as set out in the
         Country Guidance case of  GJ  (Sri  Lanka)  CG  [2013]  UKUT  00319
         (IAC)."

13. At the hearing before me, Mr Richards relied  upon  all  three  grounds
    which he developed in his oral submissions.

14. On behalf of the claimant, Ms Harris contended that the Judge  had  not
    erred in law and that each of the three grounds was unsubstantiated.  I
    will deal with  the  substance  of  both  representatives'  submissions
    shortly.



Discussion

15. Dealing with each of the three grounds in turn, Mr  Richards  submitted
    that the Judge's positive credibility finding was  flawed  because  the
    Judge, in para 48 of his determination, had failed to take into account
    inconsistencies in the claimant's evidence set out in the  reasons  for
    refusal letter and  relied  upon  by  the  Presenting  Officer  at  the
    hearing.  Mr Richards submitted that the  Judge  was  not  entitled  to
    disregard those inconsistencies as "carry[ing]  little  weight"  simply
    because the Presenting Officer had not cross-examined the claimant upon
    them.  Mr Richards submitted that  there  was  nothing  unfair  to  the
    claimant who was represented and had a full  opportunity  both  in  his
    statement and in his oral evidence-in-chief  to  raise  any  matter  he
    wished to  in  respect  of  the  inconsistencies  relied  upon  by  the
    Secretary of State.   There was no unfairness and  the  inconsistencies
    remained unresolved.

16. Ms Harris submitted that the Judge had been entitled to disregard those
    inconsistencies unless they were put to the claimant (which  they  were
    not) in cross-examination.  She referred  me  to  the  decision  in  RR
    (Challenging Evidence)  Sri  Lanka  [2010]  UKUT  274  (IAC)  where  at
    paragraph 4 of the head-note it is stated:

         "If the Respondent does not put its case clearly  it  may  well  be
         difficult for the Tribunal to decide against an Appellant  who  has
         not been  given  an  opportunity  to  deal  with  the  respondent's
         concern."

17. Further, she submitted that in the grounds the Secretary of  State  had
    failed to point out what inconsistencies were in fact relied upon.  She
    drew my attention to paras 3(j) and (k) of the  refusal  letter  and  a
    number of answers given by the claimant in interview at  Questions  20,
    21,  32  and  51.   She  submitted  that,  in  fact,  there   were   no
    inconsistencies and the claimant had provided  an  explanation  in  his
    witness statement dated 17 March 2015 at  paras  10-12  in  particular.
    This dealt with matters raised in the refusal letter:

         (1)      whether the claimant had given inconsistent evidence where
             his family saw him when they came to the  prison  (inside  his
             cell or outside) and whether it was 1 or 2 � months after  his
             detention;

         (2)      whether he had said that his brother had been of  interest
             to the authorities because he was selling  insurance  policies
             to the LTTE or whether, as a  result  of  that  business,  his
             brother had travelled to an LTTE area where he had  come  into
             contact with individuals such as  the  claimant's  brother-in-
             law, involved with the LTTE;

         (3)      whether the claimant had said that he had been arrested at
             the family home because he was suspected of being his  brother
             or because the authorities could not find his brother there.

    Ms Harris submitted that the appellant's explanation at paras 10-12 and
    a sensible reading of the claimant's answers in interview  demonstrated
    that there were no real consistencies.  In  any  event,  she  submitted
    that  at  paragraph  46  the  Judge  had  dealt  with  the   issue   of
    inconsistencies and had considered them not material because they are:

         "... very minor matters explained by difficulties with translation,
         or minor mis-understandings ..."

18. There is no doubt that an appellant in a Tribunal hearing  is  entitled
    to know the case put against him by the Secretary of State  and  to  be
    given an opportunity to deal with the issues raised by his evidence  or
    otherwise (see RR).  Fairness requires nothing less.  What is  required
    is that the claimant knows the case against him.  The case  against  an
    appellant will usually be set out in the refusal decision.  Indeed,  it
    is common practice for Presenting Officers, in  their  submissions,  to
    begin by adopting the reasons for refusal letter.   In the  usual  case
    it will be clear to an  appellant  (particularly  one  who  is  legally
    represented) that, subject to any concession by the Presenting Officer,
    that the refusal letter and the reasons within it represent  the  basis
    of the respondent's case before  the  Tribunal.    It  is  not,  in  my
    judgement, necessary for  a  Presenting  Officer  to  cross-examine  an
    appellant on each and every point raised in a refusal letter before  it
    can be said that those matters are relied upon by  the  respondent  and
    with which an appellant must have an opportunity to deal in the  course
    of a hearing.  That opportunity will usually mean that an appellant, to
    the extent he wishes, gives written  and/or  oral  evidence  about  the
    matters raised where they relate to his evidence such as, in this case,
    claimed inconsistencies in what he said.

19. Of course, where the appellant is not legally  represented  the  issues
    raised in the refusal letter may  less  obviously  be  ones  which  the
    appellant can be taken to realise are live issues in the  hearing.   It
    is good practice in such cases for  the  Judge  to  identify  with  the
    appellant the issues raised by the respondent in the refusal letter  at
    the outset so that the appellant has a fair opportunity  to  deal  with
    them in his evidence.

20. Some issues may arise subsequent to the  refusal  letter,  for  example
    after the refusal letter is written and even  at  the  hearing  itself.
    Those matters will need to be dealt with in the hearing and, it may  be
    appropriate, by cross-examination, so that an  appellant  is  aware  of
    what is said against him by the respondent and has  an  opportunity  to
    respond.

21. There cannot, however, be an obligation on the  Presenting  Officer  in
    every case to cross-examine an  appellant  in  order  on  a  particular
    matter for it to be said that an issue arises  between  the  respondent
    and appellant and so that the appellant is given a fair opportunity  to
    deal with the  issue.   Each  case  must  depend  upon  the  particular
    circumstances, in particular whether the issue is  clearly  raised  and
    whether the appellant has been given a fair opportunity  to  deal  with
    it.

22. In paragraph 48 of his determination the  Judge  in  this  appeal  said
    this:

         "The other alleged inconsistencies referred to in the  reasons  for
         refusal letter were not put to the Appellant in  cross-examination.
         I made it  very  clear  to  the  Respondent's  representative  that
         anything to be relied on in closing would have to  be  put  to  the
         Appellant in order to ensure a  fair  hearing.   The  Appellant  is
         entitled to a fair chance to  comment  on  the  case  against  him.
         Alleged  inconsistencies  that  were  not  put  to  him  in   those
         circumstances carry little weight."

23. With respect to the Judge, that is not the correct approach.  Here, the
    matters relied upon by the Secretary of State  in  the  refusal  letter
    were in issue and the claimant had a  fair  opportunity  to  deal  with
    them.  As Ms Harris sought to contend in her submission,  the  claimant
    had effectively dealt with them in his witness statement. This was  not
    a case, as envisaged in RR in the citation from the head-note  set  out
    above, where the respondent had not clearly put her  case  against  the
    claimant.

24. In those circumstances,  the  Judge  was  required  to  deal  with  the
    substance of the issues relating to the claimant's evidence which  were
    relevant to his credibility and whether his account was to be accepted.
     As the Upper Tribunal recognised in Budhathoki (Reasons for  Decision)
    [2014] UKUT 00341 (IAC) (Haddon-Cave J and UTJ Coker) as set out in the
    head-note:

         "It is...necessary for Judges to identify and resolve key conflicts
         in the evidence and explain in clear and brief terms their reasons,
         so that the parties can understand why they have won or lost.."

25. Consequently, in this case it was, in my judgement, incumbent upon  the
    Judge to engage with the Secretary of State's reasoning in the  refusal
    letter and provide adequate reasons  for  accepting  or  rejecting  the
    points relied upon and their relevance to the Judge's ultimate decision
    on credibility.

26. Ms Harris submitted that the Judge had done just that in  paragraph  46
    of his determination where he said this:

         "Having applied those principles, I find the Appellant's account to
         be credible.  When interviewed he was asked a great many  questions
         about the fine detail of his detention and abuse  and  he  answered
         all of them in impressive detail.  In my assessment his account has
         been consistent, and the alleged  inconsistencies  are  very  minor
         matters  explained  by  difficulties  of  translation,   or   minor
         misunderstandings about (for example) the  difference  between  the
         occasion of his brother's arrest and earlier  voluntary  attendance
         for questioning.  In any event, those matters do not go to the core
         of the  Appellant's  account.   The  Appellant's  account  remained
         consistent throughout cross-examination.  His evidence  was  clear,
         firm and cogent."

27. Further, as I have already indicated,  Ms  Harris  submitted  that  the
    Judge was entitled to conclude that the inconsistencies  were  in  fact
    "minor matters" which did  not  go  to  the  core  of  the  appellant's
    account.

28. Whilst Ms  Harris'  submission  is  not  without  some  merit,  I  have
    concluded that the Judge's reasoning in para 46 is inadequate.   First,
    he fails to engage explicitly with the inconsistencies relied  upon  in
    the  refusal  letter.   It   is   far   from   clear   precisely   what
    inconsistencies he considers to be "minor matters" apart from  the  one
    example he gave.  It may well be that the Judge would  be  entitled  to
    take the view, in the light of the claimant's evidence in  his  witness
    statement, and reading his interview answers in a  reasonable  and  not
    overly rigid manner that the inconsistencies at least in part evaporate
    or were minor.  However, I cannot be confident that a  Judge  would  be
    bound to reach such a view.  The Judge's reasons in para 46 do not,  in
    themselves, adequately "identify  and  resolve  key  conflicts  in  the
    evidence and explain in clear and brief terms" why they do  not  damage
    the claimants' credibility.

29. Secondly, I am also not satisfied that the Judge's  additional  reasons
    for finding the claimant to be credible are such that any  error  would
    be immaterial.  The Judge  was  clearly  impressed  by  the  claimant's
    interview which he described as "impressive" in its  detail.   He  also
    noted that his account was largely consistent and also consistent  with
    the medical evidence.  The Judge's latter finding is at para 49 of  his
    determination and is not challenged. However, a  central  part  of  the
    claimant's case was that as a result of what had happened  to  him  and
    his family in Sri Lanka he was subject to a summons and arrest warrant.
     For the reasons I will give shortly,  the  Judge's  approach  to  that
    evidence is flawed.  It is quite impossible to say that, as  a  result,
    the Judge's overall positive credibility finding can stand.

30. I now turn to the  challenge  to  the  court  documents  which  is  the
    Secretary of State's second ground.

31. Mr Richards submitted that the Judge was not entitled to disregard  the
    verification reports on those documents on the basis given in paragraph
    50 of his determination.  There, the Judge said this:

         "I also give some weight,  but  not  great  weight,  to  the  court
         documents  produced  by  the  Appellant.   On  the  one  hand   the
         Respondent  has  obtained  verification  reports  disputing   their
         authenticity.  On the other, there are clear and  worrying  defects
         in the verification reports themselves.  The lack of  care  in  the
         verification reports undermines their probative value.  In all  the
         circumstances I am prepared to give the summons and arrest  warrant
         some limited weight.  I give  the  Appellant  the  benefit  of  the
         doubt."

32. Ms Harris submitted that the Judge had set out the "clear and  worrying
    defects" in the report and the  lack  of  care  in  preparing  them  at
    paragraph 31 of his determination where he said this:

         "In response, and following an adjournment of the  date  originally
         fixed  for  this  appeal  hearing,  the  Respondent  has   obtained
         "Document Verification Reports" from the British High Commission in
         Colombo.  An Entry Clearance  Assistant,  whose  name  and  contact
         details have been redacted, states that she or he has  checked  the
         authenticity of the court documents relied upon by  the  Appellant.
         On 13th May 2015 a verification request was faxed to the  Registrar
         of the Batticaloa Magistrate's Court.  On 26th May 2015 a reply was
         received by telephone from  the  Acting  Registrar  of  that  court
         stating that the arrest warrant and summons were  not  genuine  for
         the following reasons:

          i) the seals on the arrest warrant are not in the format  of  the
             seals used by the court (the correct seal is not described nor
             is any example given);

         ii) the format of the wording is not that used by the  court  (the
             usual wording is not given by way of comparison);

        iii) the handwriting does not match that of the relevant member  of
             staff (who is not identified);

         iv) the signature of the magistrate does not match that of the one
             present on the alleged date of issue (no names are given);

          v) similar points are made in relation to the  summons,  although
             rather  troublingly  the  document  verification   report   in
             relation to the  summons  erroneously  refers  to  the  arrest
             warrant.   Clearly  some  "cut  and  pasting"   has   occurred
             incorporating errors.  It  is  impossible  to  know  what  the
             document should have said in relation to the summons."

33. Ms Harris submitted that  the  Secretary  of  State's  case  (which  Mr
    Richards accepted was so before me) was that  the  documents  were  not
    genuine and therefore the burden was on the Secretary of State to prove
    on a balance of probabilities that  they  were  false  documents.   The
    reasons given by the Judge in paragraph 31 were, Ms  Harris  submitted,
    such that the Judge was entitled to find the Secretary of State had not
    discharged the burden of proof upon her.

34. By and large, the proper assessment of evidence is that special  domain
    of a first instance judge.  In the context of assessing  oral  evidence
    the Judge will have had the benefit of seeing and hearing  the  witness
    give evidence.  It is trite law to state that  an  appellate  court  or
    tribunal will be cautious in interfering with a Judge's  finding  based
    upon his or her assessment of the  oral  evidence  of  a  witness.   Of
    course, in  an  unusual  case,  the  Judge's  assessment  maybe  wholly
    irrational (or obviously unsustainable in the light of other  evidence)
    such that an appellate court or tribunal is  entitled  to  identify  an
    error of law in a Judge's assessment.

35. The reluctance, however, to interfere  with  a  Judge's  assessment  of
    evidence is much less marked where the evidence is  documentary  or  in
    written form in circumstances in which the appellate court or  tribunal
    is in as good a position to assess that evidence as the Judge at  first
    instance.

36.  Here,  I  am  concerned  with  the  assessment  of   two   documentary
    verification reports.  The Judge's conclusion in  respect  of  them  at
    para 50 is not entirely clear.  He plainly took  the  view  that  their
    probative value was undermined by "clear and worrying defects" and  the
    lack of care in preparing them.  In the result, the Judge  stated  that
    he was "prepared to give the summons and arrest  warrant  some  limited
    weight. I give the appellant the benefit of the doubt."

37. In fact, at para 53 in assessing the objective risk to the claimant  on
    return he took into account that "there is an extant  warrant  for  his
    arrest".  It is clear, therefore, that  he  rejected  the  verification
    reports which concluded that both the warrant  and  summons  were  "not
    genuine" and that the Secretary of State had not proved that they  were
    other than genuine.

38. In my judgement, the Judge was not entitled to reach that view for  the
    reasons he gave.  The verification reports were based upon a  telephone
    call, following an enquiry by the  BHC  in  Colombo,  from  the  Acting
    Registrar of the Court from which it was said the  summons  and  arrest
    warrant had been issued.  That evidence was clear that the seal on  the
    arrest warrant was not the format  used  by  the  Court.   It  was  not
    necessary for the verification report to set out what was  the  correct
    seal.  Secondly, the report stated that the format  of  both  documents
    was not that used by the Court.  The fact that the "usual wording"  was
    not included in the documents did  not  undermine  the  force  of  that
    evidence from an officer of the Court who would have been  fully  aware
    of the "usual wording" in making the comparison.  Thirdly, that reports
    both state that the handwriting of the "relevant member  of  staff"  in
    respect of each  document  was  not  a  match  with  the  staff  member
    designated.  Again, that evidence was not materially undermined  simply
    because  that  member  of  staff  was  not  identified.   Finally,  the
    documents both state that the signature  of  the  Magistrate  does  not
    match the one present on the date the documents  were  issued.   Again,
    the fact that the name of the relevant Magistrate was not  included  in
    the document does not undermine the strength of the evidence.

39. In para 31(v) the Judge finds "rather troubling" that the  verification
    report in relation to the  "summons"  refers,  at  one  point,  to  the
    "arrest warrant".  That is, of course, a mistake.  However, an  overall
    reading of the report in relation to the "summons" clearly demonstrates
    that the report relates to the "summons" and not the "arrest  warrant".
    The Judge's suggestion that there has been some "cut and  pasting"  is,
    with respect, highly speculative and, in any event, does not affect the
    evidence recorded in the document emanating from the  Acting  Registrar
    of the Court in Sri Lanka that each document has a number  of  features
    which are wholly inconsistent with either being a genuine document.

40. In my judgement, the Judge was not entitled,  in  effect,  to  conclude
    that the verification reports did not speak the truth for  the  reasons
    he gave in para 31 and which he incorporated by reference  in  para  50
    leading to him accepting that both  the  summons  and  arrest  warrants
    should be given "some limited weight" and, in relation  to  the  arrest
    warrant at least, accepting it as being genuine given his treatment  of
    the arrest warrant in paras 53 and 55 as  relevant  to  the  claimant's
    objective risk on return applying GJ and Others.

41. For these reasons, I accept Mr  Richards  submissions  that  the  Judge
    erred in law in his  approach  to  the  document  verification  reports
    which, in effect, he rejected and thereby accepted that the summons and
    arrest warrant were genuine documents upon which the  claimant  was  at
    least entitled to place "some limited weight" in his claim.

42. It is axiomatic, in my view, that the Judge in approaching the issue of
    the claimant's credibility had to  have  regard  to  all  the  evidence
    including the documentary evidence.  His acceptance of the summons  and
    arrest warrant as genuine documents - given the  issues  before  him  -
    must  necessarily  have  had  an  impact  on  his  overall  credibility
    assessment.  His error in approach to the genuineness  of  the  summons
    and arrest warrant therefore, in my  judgement,  tainted  his  positive
    credibility finding.

43. Given that that finding cannot stand, the  Judge's  assessment  of  the
    objective risk to the claimant applying GJ and Others in paras 52-55 is
    also necessarily flawed.  That assessment is based upon  an  acceptance
    of the claimant's past history, including the commencement of  criminal
    proceedings against him and the existence of an extant arrest  warrant.



44. It is,  therefore,  in  my  judgement  unnecessary  to  deal  with  the
    Secretary of State's third submission that the Judge's assessment  that
    the objective risk to the claimant on return was  not  supported  by  a
    proper understanding of the risk categories in GJ and Others.   In  the
    absence of a sustainable credibility finding, there is  no  basis  upon
    which the Judge could have found the appellant to be at risk on  return
    for the reasons he gave.

Decision and Disposal

45. Consequently,  the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  to  allow
    the appellant's appeal involved the making of an  error  of  law.   The
    Judge's  positive  credibility  finding,  including  his  findings   in
    relation to the Court documents, cannot stand and,  as  a  consequence,
    neither can his finding that  the  claimant  was  objectively  at  risk
    applying GJ and Others.  The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    allow the claimant's appeal on asylum grounds and under Article  3  is,
    consequently, set aside and must be remade.

46. Given the nature and the extent of the fact finding required,  applying
    para 7.2 of the Senior President's Practice Statement it is appropriate
    that the appeal be remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  order  to
    remake the decision by a judge other than Judge Whitmore.

47. Ms Harris invited me, if that was my decision, to preserve the findings
    in paragraphs 47 and 49 in respect of the relevance of  the  claimant's
    delay in claiming asylum to his credibility and, in that  regard  also,
    the Judge's conclusion that on the basis  of  the  medical  report  the
    claimant's scarring was "consistent" with his account.

48. Both of these matters go to the issue of  the  claimant's  credibility.
    That is  an  overarching  issue  which  the  First-tier  Tribunal  must
    determine  de  novo  at  the  remitted  hearing.    The   Judge   must,
    necessarily, consider all aspects of the evidence relied  upon  by  the
    claimant and the Secretary of State including  the  matters  raised  in
    paras 47 and 49.  It would  be  wholly  artificial  to  preserve  those
    limited findings given the need  for  the  Judge  to  make  an  overall
    assessment of the  evidence  in  reaching  a  view  on  the  claimant's
    credibility.  Consequently, none of the Judge's findings are preserved.
