For the Respondent:    Miss Savage


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant born on 3rd July 1985  is  a  citizen  of  Morocco.   The
    Appellant who was present was represented by Mr Hoshi.  The  Respondent
    was represented by Miss Savage a Presenting Officer.

Substantive Issues under Appeal

 2. The Appellant had applied for leave to remain as a spouse of a  British
    citizen on 9th September 2013.  The Respondent refused that application
    on 30th July 2014.  The Appellant had appealed that  decision  and  his
    appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Clark sitting  at  Taylor
    House on 5th January 2015.   The  judge  had  allowed  the  Appellant's
    appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 3. The Respondent  had  made  application  to  appeal  that  decision  and
    permission was granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Landes  on  23rd
    February 2015.  It was said that the grounds were arguable in  that  at
    the date of application the Appellant and  Sponsor  did  not  meet  the
    income threshold required and  the  judge  had  found  post-application
    salary increases to be determinative.  Directions were issued  for  the
    Upper Tribunal to decide firstly whether an error of law had been  made
    or not and  the  matter  comes  before  me  in  accordance  with  those
    directions.

Submissions on Behalf of the Respondent

 4.  Miss  Savage  referred  me  to  the  grounds  contained   within   the
    Respondent's application to appeal.

Submissions on Behalf of the Appellant

 5. Mr Hoshi referred to Section 85(4) of the 2002 Act and said  the  judge
    was entitled to consider circumstances at the date of hearing.

 6. I now provide my decision with reasons.

Decision and Reasons

 7. There was a single basis of  refusal  in  this  case  namely  that  the
    Appellant and his Sponsor wife did not meet the income threshold as  at
    the date of application.  There is no dispute  on  that  fact  and  the
    Appellant's application form discloses that at the date of  application
    his wife earned a salary of �18,000 per annum and one month  prior  had
    additionally earned �160 in a self-employed  capacity.   The  Rules  of
    Appendix FM and FM-SE applied in this case and  in  particular  it  was
    necessary for the Appellant to demonstrate the  income  threshold  over
    the appropriate period of time in  accordance  with  paragraph  3.1  of
    Appendix FM.  The Appellant could not meet the income threshold at  the
    date of application.  Although the  Appellant's  wife  had  had  a  pay
    increase taking her salary to �19,000 per annum that had only come into
    effect on 1st July 2014 whilst the  Appellant's  application  had  been
    made in September 2013.  Further the Respondent's refusal had also been
    made in July 2014.  It was not a case therefore that even at  the  date
    of refusal the Appellant  was  able  to  show  the  appropriate  income
    threshold over the required period  of  time  and  with  the  necessary
    documentation required by Appendix FM and FM-SE.

 8. It is clear that the  judge,  understandably,  had  sympathy  with  the
    position of the Appellant but  nevertheless  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules are clear and whilst perhaps in  some  respects  very
    prescriptive, that is the legal framework under  which  cases  must  be
    decided.  It was a material error of law for the judge  to  have  taken
    account of the increased salary that postdated the date of  application
    and in any event was not in itself evidenced by the necessary documents
    and period of time as prescribed  within  the  Immigration  Rules.   In
    reality the judge had little choice in this case  other  than  to  have
    dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules and the remedy for the
    Appellant, if he  wished,  was  to  make  a  fresh  application  where,
    presuming the salary increase had remained on the face of it, he  would
    have had no difficulty in  providing  the  evidence  and  documents  to
    demonstrate that the income threshold was met.

 9. There are no further documents before me and given the  nature  of  the
    error in this case as referred to above, having found a material  error
    of law was  made  in  remaking  that  decision,  I  would  dismiss  the
    Appellant's appeal.  However I would perhaps indicate to the  Appellant
    the remedy available to him in terms of a fresh application in  a  case
    where there were clearly no other concerns other than  his  failure  to
    meet the income threshold.

Notice of Decision

I find a material error of law was made by the judge in this  case  and  set
aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and for  reasons  given  above
in remaking that decision I dismiss the Appellant's appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
