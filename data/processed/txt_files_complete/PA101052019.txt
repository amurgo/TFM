                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
        Tribunal Judge Trent ('the Judge') promulgated on 25 November  2019
        in which the Judge dismissed the appellants  appeal  on  protection
        and human rights grounds. Permission to appeal  was  granted  on  a
        renewed application by a judge of the Upper Tribunal who  found  it
        was arguable for  the  reasons  advanced  in  the  grounds  seeking
        permission to appeal that the Judge did not approach  the  evidence
        holistically or properly assess the risk on return.




Background


     2. The appellant is a citizen of Turkey born on 8 May 1994 who arrived
        in the UK lawfully on 4 May  2019  on  a  short-term  student  visa
        issued on 17 April 2019, having flown  directly  from  Istanbul  to
        Stansted Airport using his own passport.
     3. The appellant claimed asylum on 4 June 2019 asserting  he  faced  a
        real risk on return to Turkey of being persecuted as he was  (a)  a
        supporter or member of the G�len movement  (b)  had  been  expelled
        from the Turkish Military Academy  on  31  July  2016  pursuant  to
        Emergency Decree 669 as a result of his G�lenist  affiliations  (c)
        came to the attention of the authorities again when on 6  May  2019
        someone from the Military Academy under torture identified him as a
        G�lenist and (d) the authorities raided his house in Turkey  on  11
        June 2019 accusing him of being a member of the G�len movement  and
        he is now the subject of an arrest warrant in Turkey.
     4. This is  a  detailed  determination  in  which  the  Judge,  having
        assessed both the documentary and oral evidence, sets out a summary
        of such evidence  in  relation  to  the  question  of  whether  the
        appellant is perceived as being involved by the Turkish state  with
        the G�len movement at 24 (a)-(i).
     5. The Judge set out the core findings of fact at 25  (a)-(i)  in  the
        following terms:

          a) During his time  in  Turkey,  the  Appellant  attended  weekly
             meetings of the G�lenist movement  and  read  G�lenist  books,
             giving weekly reports as to his activities. While  at  school,
             he spent time living in  G�lenist  accommodation.  He  had  no
             formal role in the G�lenist movement.


          b) The Appellant attended the Turkish Military Academy  until  it
             was closed pursuant  to  Emergency  Decree  669.  He  was  not
             expelled  from  the  Military  Academy  by  reason  of   being
             perceived to be a G�lenist. Rather,  he  transferred  to  Gazi
             University pursuant to Article  105  of  the  Decree  one  the
             Military  Academy  was  closed.  The  Appellant  was   not   a
             Lieutenant in the Turkish military. It follows that  there  is
             no link between the Appellants involvement with  the  military
             in Turkey and his claim to be perceived by the  Turkish  state
             as a G�lenist as a result of which the risk he claims to  face
             is not exasperated by his previous military involvement.


          c) After the coup attempt  in  July  2016,  the  Appellant  began
             working as an accountant for a  company  called  Emin  Yeminli
             Mali Musavirlik. He got this job through a connexion with  the
             G�lenist  movement,  but  the  company  was  not  a   G�lenist
             organisation.


          d) The Appellant did not leave Turkey and fly to the UK  in  fear
             of persecution.


          e) The Appellant's  name  has  not  been  given  to  the  Turkish
             authorities as being a G�lenist, whether on 6 May 2019  or  at
             all.


          f) The Turkish authorities are not carrying out any investigation
             into the appellant's involvement with the  G�lenist  movement,
             whether as referred to in the solicitor's letter of 22 October
             2019 or at all.


          g) The  Appellant's  father  is  not  perceived  by  the  Turkish
             authorities as being a G�lenist, and  the  appellant  has  not
             come under suspicion of being a G�lenist by  affiliation  with
             his father.


          h) It follows from the findings above,  taking  into  account  my
             finding as to his credibility, that the  Appellants  house  in
             Turkey was not raided by the Turkish authorities, and there is
             no warrant for his arrest in Turkey.


          i) The appellant is not come to  the  attention  of  the  Turkish
             authorities is being a G�lenist, and the  Turkish  authorities
             do not perceive him as such.


Error of law


     6. Ms Nnamani in her grounds seeking permission to appeal asserted the
        Judge had made a misdirection as to the risk on return  in  failing
        to adequately consider any such risk in the context of  a  returnee
        whose name had been given to the authorities  following  torture  ,
        the appellants background as a Military Academy attendee,  and  his
        overall association with the G�len movement.  It was submitted  the
        Judge misconstrued the evidence relating to the appellants  ability
        to leave Turkey legally and  his  father's  arrest  and  failed  to
        adequately consider  the  content  of  the  summons  which  it  was
        submitted supports the appellants case.  The Judge is said to  have
        failed to consider the situation in Turkey in  August  2018  for  a
        G�lenist. The appellant specifically asserts the  Judge  failed  to
        adequately consider "the reliable evidence that the authorities had
        taken recent interest in the appellant despite his  departure  from
        Turkey (legally)".  It is claimed the Judge erred in rejecting that
        evidence and dealt inadequately  with  evidence  which  showed  the
        appellant was wanted by the authorities and erred in  his  approach
        to the Turkish solicitor's letter when stating the letter  was  not
        genuine. The appellant asserts it was not  open  to  the  Judge  to
        determine genuineness or forgery or that the content of the  letter
        was untrue. The grounds  submit  that  given  the  Judges  positive
        findings on the appellant, the background material,  and  potential
        profile,  his  conclusion  there  was  no  risk  resulted  from   a
        misdirection and failure to adequately assess the country reports.
     7. It is important to specifically consider the  details  relevant  to
        this appeal. It was not in dispute that following the coup  attempt
        in Turkey in 2016 those perceived to be supporters of the  G�lenist
        movement did at that time face a real risk of being detained by the
        authorities although it is  also  clear  from  the  recent  country
        material that a considerable number  of  those  initially  arrested
        have been  released  without  charge.   It  is  accepted  there  is
        evidence of further interest in G�lenist since August 2016 as there
        is reference to investigation and  action  by  the  authorities  in
        Turkey against those perceived to be  supporters  of  the  G�lenist
        movement continuing at sporadic intervals, including  reference  to
        more recent action and detentions.  Considering the extend  of  the
        G�lenist movement within Turkish society, clearly recorded  in  the
        country material as being extensive, it is understandable  that  it
        will take time to investigate all those potentially of  concern  to
        the government.  It is accepted that a substantial number of  those
        in the Turkish military suspected of being G�lenist were  dismissed
        from  their  posts  and  some  detained  and  subject  to   ongoing
        proceedings.
     8. The appellant suggests that  as  a  result  of  his  attending  the
        Turkish Military Academy he may  somehow  be  viewed  with  similar
        suspicion to those who were detained as a result of their  military
        connexions. In his asylum interview at question  1.14,  when  asked
        his occupation in his home country, he claimed he was a student  in
        the Military Academy; but that interview took place on 4 June  2019
        when that response was clearly untrue.
     9. The appellant applied in his own name to UK Visas  and  Immigration
        on the 8 April 2019 for a short-term student visa to enable him  to
        undertake an  intensive  English  language  course  in  the  United
        Kingdom between 4 May 2019 and 27 July 2019.  The  Entry  Clearance
        Officer (ECO) noted the appellant  claimed  to  have  worked  as  a
        financial adviser since 1 June 2018 at  the  company  named  above,
        whilst at the same time preparing for the examination of  Certified
        Financial Advisors set by the Turkish government, for which he  was
        required to provide evidence of  a  certain  level  of  English  to
        enable him to obtain an international  tax  adviser  and  certified
        public finance  advisor  licence.  It  was  for  this  purpose  the
        appellant stated  he  wished  to  study  on  an  intensive  English
        language  course  in  the  UK.  The  appellant  was  asked  on  the
        application form about  details  of  his  employment  to  which  he
        confirmed he was  a  financial  specialist  who  had  undertaken  a
        compulsory internship at the  company  between  November  2017  and
        April 2018.  The ECO undertook the normal inquiries  into  such  an
        application and  contacted  the  company  who  confirmed  that  the
        appellant was employed by them in the capacity claimed, leading  to
        it being concluded that such employment was credible.
    10. The appellant was also asked in the application  form  to  set  out
        details about work he had done for a number of specified  types  of
        organisations  one  of  which  was  the  armed  forces,   including
        compulsory national military service, to which the appellant stated
        had not worked in any of  the  jobs  listed.   The  appellant  also
        stated his intention to return to Turkey when he had completed  his
        English language course.  There is  credible  evidence  based  upon
        enquiries made, as recorded in the  application  details  contained
        within the respondents bundle, that the appellants  employment  had
        been verified as genuine, that he had the intention to study in the
        United Kingdom,  and  return  to  Turkey  thereafter.  The  company
        confirmed the appellant had been granted leave  to  enable  him  to
        come to the United Kingdom to improve his English language and that
        the company were paying his expenses for such purpose.
    11. It is also  important  to  consider  the  purpose  of  the  Turkish
        Military Academy whose stated his aim is to educate and  train  the
        Corps of Cadets, offering courses to those who  study  not  all  of
        whom are likely to be active serving members of the  Turkish  armed
        forces. This is not an organisation  with  the  same  structure  as
        Sandhurst or Catterick which are set up for the  sole  purposes  of
        training applicants for active  military  service  in  the  British
        Army.
    12. The chronology shows the appellant obtained the diploma referred to
        by the Judge in  2016  having  undertaken  a  four-year  course  in
        Business Management, issued by the Gazi University.  The  appellant
        must have commenced his studies in 2012 and concluded them in  2016
        when he would have been 22 years of age.
    13. Ms Nnamani was asked about  the  appellant's  national  service  as
        there is no detailed  reference  to  this  in  his  statements  and
        ordinarily military service is required between the ages of 20  and
        41 but if a person has  a  degree  or  qualification  this  can  be
        deferred until they  have  completed  their  studies  for  which  a
        reduced time has to be served, but she was  unable  to  assist   in
        this point.
    14. Despite the Turkish government declaring the G�lenist  movement  to
        be an illegal terrorist organisation in May 2016, the Supreme Court
        ruling it was an armed terrorist organisation in  a  later  ruling,
        the attempted coup on 15 July 2016, and the imposition of  a  state
        of emergency four days later, there is no  evidence  the  appellant
        was arrested  or  detained  at  any  time  during  that  period  or
        thereafter during his time in Turkey.  The appellant was also  able
        to complete his studies at the Gazi University indicating a lack of
        interest in him by the authorities. This  is  the  finding  of  the
        Judge which has not been shown to be outside  the  range  of  those
        available to him.  Rather than being  detained  the  appellant  was
        transferred to another educational institution  to  enable  him  to
        complete his studies.  The Judge specifically notes at 24(a):

             "(a) In light of the Appellants inconsistent evidence to which
                  I have already referred as to his claimed  expulsion  from
                  the Military Academy,  or alternatively  the  military,  I
                  find (applying the lower standard of proof)  that  he  was
                  not expelled from  the  Military  Academy  in  July  2016.
                  Rather, bearing in mind Article 104-5 of  the  Decree  and
                  the  Appellants  diploma  certificate,  I  find  that  the
                  Military Academy was closed pursuant  to  the  decree  and
                  that the appellant was transferred to Gazi  University  to
                  complete his diploma. In light of the Appellant's name not
                  appearing on the list of dismissed military  personnel,  I
                  also find that the Appellant was not a Lieutenant  in  the
                  military at the time of Emergency Decree 699.  In light of
                  those findings, it follows that the Appellant had not come
                  to detention of the Turkish or authorities as  a  G�lenist
                  at the time of Emergency Decree 699 on 31  July  2016.  It
                  also follows that there is no link between his involvement
                  with the military in Turkey and his claim to be  perceived
                  by the Turkish state as a G�lenist, as a result  of  which
                  the risk he claims to  face  is  not  exasperated  by  his
                  previous military involvement."

    15. I find the appellant  has  failed  to  establish  any  legal  error
        material to this aspect of the  decision.    The  Judge's  findings
        have not been shown not to be within the range of those  reasonably
        open to the Judge on the evidence.
    16. The Judge also finds that when the appellant  left  Turkey  he  was
        able to travel through a recognised International  Airport  on  his
        own passport using a visa  issued  to  him  in  his  own  name  and
        encountering no problems on departure. The Judge is  criticised  by
        Ms Nnamani for such a finding; attempting to argue before the Upper
        Tribunal that the appellant  fled  before  there  was  any  adverse
        interest in him by the Turkish  authorities  and  when  there  were
        therefore no 'stop notices' or anything at the airport  that  would
        have prevented his departure.
    17. In relation to this claim it is important to look again at  the  UK
        Visa and Immigration application form in which  the  appellant  was
        asked  about  his  passport  details.  He  confirmed  the   issuing
        authority was the Turkish Passport Service and  that  the  passport
        was issued to him on 6 November 2018. I find no arguable  merit  in
        the submission by Ms Nnamani there may have been a  different  body
        responsible for issuing  passports  to  those  suspending  existing
        passports, as clearly there is one recognised  passport  agency  in
        Turkey who would act to do the governments bidding in terms of  the
        issue or suspension of  passports  relating  to  Turkish  Nationals
        being suspected of being G�lenist with the requisite profile.
    18. Ms Nnamani's submission that on 6 November 2018 when the  appellant
        left Turkey there was no evidence of adverse interest in  him  such
        as to warrant action  being  taken  is  undermined  by  a  document
        submitted pursuant to paragraph  15(2A)  of  the  Procedure  Rules,
        which was not before the Judge, recording the date of issue of  the
        passport and recording that on 13  March  2018  the  appellant  was
        subject to proceedings  being  commenced  in  the  "Heavy  Criminal
        Court"  in  relation  to  his  illegal  membership  of  a  G�lenist
        organisation which, as  noted  above,  had  been  declared  by  the
        authorities to be an illegal terrorist organisation in May 2016 and
        ruled to be an armed terrorist organisation by  the  Supreme  Court
        shortly thereafter. The appellant claims it  was  as  a  result  of
        suspected membership of this organisation that he faced a real risk
        and if, as he now claims, he  was  suspected  and  the  subject  of
        criminal proceedings as  a  result  in  early  2018  it  completely
        undermines his claim that he was issued with a passport in November
        2018 and was able to leave the country using that passport  without
        experience any difficulties because there was no interest in him.
    19. The appellant provided a letter  from  a  solicitor  in  Turkey  in
        support of his evidence which was considered by the Judge who  sets
        out findings at 24(i)  of  the  decision  under  challenge  in  the
        following terms:





             "(i) The Appellant said in  oral  evidence  that  there  is  a
                  warrant for his arrest in Turkey. No such warrant, nor any
                  evidence  of  its  existence,  has  been   produced.   The
                  Appellant claims that he has tried to access  the  warrant
                  via his  solicitor,  but  the  file  is  secret,  and  the
                  solicitor cannot obtain the evidence. In support of  this,
                  the Appellant has submitted a letter dated 22 October 2019
                  from a solicitor in Ankara who  claims  to  have  obtained
                  information  from  the  Ankara  Chief  Public  Prosecution
                  Office that an investigation has been opened  against  the
                  appellant under Turkish  Penal  Code  314/2,  case  number
                  2018/ 126312, accusing him of being a member  of  FETO/PDY
                  Armed  Terrorist  Organisation  (a   term   standing   for
                  Fethullah G�len Terrorist Organization, an  umbrella  term
                  used by the Turkish government since the coup attempt  for
                  persons of suspected of being G�lenist: CPIN para 6.10.1).
                  Importantly, there is no  suggestion  in  the  solicitor's
                  letter that any arrest warrant has  been  issued,  and  no
                  documents have been provided  to  support  the  assertions
                  made in the letter. The letter states in this regard  that
                  the investigation is confidential  and  that  "it  is  not
                  possible to obtain relevant information and  document[sic]
                  regarding the investigation". However, no  explanation  is
                  given  as  to  how,  if  the   investigation   is   indeed
                  confidential, the solicitor was able to find out that such
                  an investigation is ongoing, what  is  being  investigated
                  and even the case number, but is  nevertheless  unable  to
                  obtain any other information or documents,  including  any
                  information as to whether a warrant has  been  issued  for
                  the appellant's arrest. Finally,  although  the  appellant
                  claims that the letter was sent to him by email, there  is
                  no evidence of it being sent to him in that manner, and no
                  reliable evidence as to its provenance.  In  light  of  my
                  findings as to the appellants  credibility,  and  applying
                  Tanveer Ahmed, I  find  that  the  letter  is  either  not
                  genuine or that its content, including the statement  that
                  there is an ongoing investigation into the  Appellant  for
                  being a G�lenist, is untrue.  In  any  event,  the  letter
                  says nothing to support the appellants claim to be subject
                  of an arrest warrant."

    20. The Judge clearly considered the letter together with all the other
        evidence made available by the  appellant  cumulatively,  including
        the adverse credibility finding at [22] in which it was  found  "It
        is readily apparent from the evidence above that the  Appellant  is
        prepared not to tell the truth when he considers it will assist his
        case.  Although  some  of  the  matters  described  above  are  not
        fundamental to his account of the risk he claims to face on  return
        to Turkey, taken together they  nevertheless  materially  undermine
        his general credibility and required  the  tribunal  to  treat  the
        remainder of his evidence with caution ". The Judge  sets  out  the
        reasons for such a finding at [21] of the decision under challenge.
        These are findings clearly within the  range  of  those  reasonably
        open to the Judge on the evidence.
    21. This is not a case in which the respondent  asserted  the  document
        was forged, in which case the burden would  have  fallen  upon  the
        respondent to establish this fact, but of the Judge having assessed
        the content of the letter  against  the  evidence  concluding  that
        little weight could be placed upon it. That is a finding within the
        range of those reasonably open to the Judge when  the  evidence  is
        considered in the round.
    22. Mr Jarvis in his oral submissions  argued  that  the  three  points
        relied upon by Ms Nnamani did not match those on  which  permission
        had been granted, but that he was not prejudiced  in  dealing  with
        the same and argued they too did not  establish  arguable  material
        error.
    23. I find it is not made out that when assessing the evidence there is
        any thing to support a finding there was an  artificial  separation
        in the Judges thinking or  structure  sufficient  to  amount  to  a
        material error of law.
    24. The Judge makes clear findings as to a risk on return  noting  that
        as a result of the appellants failure to establish that  his  claim
        is credible or that he has any adverse profile of interest  to  the
        Turkish authorities that he will face any real risk  on  return  to
        Turkey of serious harm or  alleged  ill  treatment,  sufficient  to
        warrant a grant of international protection. Whilst  the  appellant
        may not like that conclusion and seek  a  more  favourable  outcome
        that does not establish arguable legal error, per se.
    25. The Judge was entitled to note that for three years after the  coup
        the appellant experienced no difficulties  in  Turkey,  was  issued
        with a passport, and able  to  leave  Turkey  using  that  passport
        without difficulties.  The Judge  clearly  considered  the  alleged
        summons in detail setting out at 24(e):

             "The Appellant claims that his father is currently subject  of
             a court case as a result of the authorities' suspicion that he
             is involved in the G�lenist movement, with which the Appellant
             says his father is  indeed  involved.  The  summons  documents
             produced by the appellant make no reference to  the  basis  of
             the court case against the appellant's  father.  In  fact,  it
             appears from those documents that the appellant's  father  has
             not been arrested and there is no warrant for his arrest:  the
             summonses states that he will  be  arrested  if  he  does  not
             appear on certain dates to give a statement.  The  Appellant's
             claimed fear that  he  will  be  arrested  immediately  if  he
             returns to Turkey is  not  consistent  with  the  evidence  in
             respect of his father's position."

    26. The Judge also notes there is no evidence other than the appellants
        own  word  that  he  is  a  G�lenist.   In  light  of  the  adverse
        credibility findings the Judge was entitled to treat such  evidence
        with caution.
    27. In her reply Ms Nnamani referred  to  the  CIPU  at  paragraph  5.3
        regarding the cancellation of passports in  which  it  is  recorded
        that those abroad suspected of supporting the G�lenist movement may
        have their passports cancelled rendering them either  stateless  or
        requiring their attendance at the Turkish High Commission to obtain
        a temporary one-way passport to enable them to re-enter Turkey. The
        authorities view is that they will then be able to appear before  a
        court and if it is established they are not G�lenist their passport
        returned to them. The country information  records  140,000  people
        having had their passports cancelled preventing them leaving Turkey
        but if those suspected of being  G�lenist  have  had  their  travel
        documents cancelled this undermines the appellant's claim as he was
        not only issued with a passport  but  also  able  to  leave  Turkey
        without difficulties at the airport.
    28. Whilst the appellant relies upon a report from the  London  Academy
        Organisation, a body which has analysed aspects of the Secretary of
        State's cases when dealing with G�lenist,  such  a  generic  report
        does not undermine the specific conclusions reached  by  the  Judge
        having had the benefit of seeing and hearing the oral evidence.
    29. The appellant also sought to rely upon a second document  that  was
        not  before  the  Judge,  under   paragraph   15(2A),   purportedly
        cancelling his passport and an order of December 2019 that he  must
        not leave Turkey.  It is not clear why such an order would be  made
        when it is the appellants case his father told the  police  he  had
        already left Turkey and they will have a record of this fact  as  a
        result of his having passed through the International Airport.  The
        appellant claimed this evidence was given to the  police  in  2019.
        The  order  cancelling  the  passport  also  seems  to  be   itself
        questionable as it states the passport was not cancelled  until  20
        August 2020 despite an earlier order that the appellant should  not
        leave the country  made  in  December  2019  when,  logically,  the
        matters would coincide.  It is also noted  the  cancellation  order
        indicates it is only valid for one month from 20 August 2020 to  20
        September 2020 which does not appear to be in accordance  with  the
        country information regarding  the  cancellation  of  passports  of
        those suspected being members of the G�lenist movement.
    30. In summary, this is a carefully considered and written decision  in
        which the Judge clearly had in mind  the  whole  of  the  available
        evidence relied upon by the appellant and the Secretary  of  State.
        The Judge sets out findings of fact which are supported by adequate
        reasons.  Whilst  the  appellant  disagrees  the  grounds  fail  to
        establish arguable legal error material to the decision to  dismiss
        the appeal sufficient to warrant the Upper Tribunal interfering any
        further in this matter.
