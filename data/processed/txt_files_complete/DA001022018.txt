               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                 PIOTR WEDA
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr G Rea, of Rea Law, Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Parties are as above, but the rest of this determination refers to them
    as they were in the FtT.

 2. This decision is to be read with:

      i) The SSHD's deportation decision dated 31 January 2018.

     ii) The appellant's grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

    iii) The decision of FtT Judge Green, promulgated on 26 April 2018.

     iv) The SSHD's grounds of appeal to the UT, stated in  the  application
         for permission to appeal dated 8 May 2018.

      v) The grant of permission by the FtT, issued on 1 November 2018.

 3. Mr Govan submitted along the lines of the grounds.  He  said  that  the
    judge gave undue weight to the absence of offending since the appellant
    was last released from custody, and since he came to the UK, which  was
    only a short period, to be put in context against a history of  serious
    offending over many years.  There was no  relevance  in  the  appellant
    being trusted to look after his 3-year-old great niece, when  his  past
    offending had nothing to do with children.  There was no explanation of
    why the misleading letter in the appellant's name  (C1  of  the  SSHD's
    inventory, paragraph 27 of the decision) had been found not  to  damage
    his case.

 4. I was not persuaded that the grounds disclosed  anything  amounting  to
    error of law, such that the decision of the FtT ought to be set aside.

 5. I saw some force in the SSHD's point that it was difficult to  see  why
    the judge found it significant that the appellant was recently  trusted
    with the care of a young child.  His offending does not relate  to  the
    domestic setting, and does not obviously imply that,  unless  reformed,
    he would "not be allowed to live under the same roof".

 6. That, however, that is only one  among  several  reasons.   The  judge,
    having explicitly noted the seriousness and persistence  of  offending,
    founded upon:

       . no offence since last released, and since coming to the UK in March
         2016;

       . no reason to come to SSHD's attention, but for the possibility that
         this was due to recent proactive checking of records;

       . support in the proceedings, and in respect of bail, from his niece,
         her fiancï¿½e, and his employer;

       . release on and compliance with bail;

       . support from witnesses aware of his criminal past; and

       . the appellant's oral evidence, found to be candid and reliable.

 7. At [27], discounting the misleading letter, the  judge  noted  that  it
    purported to be in the appellant's name, but was unsigned; that it  was
    written in English, which he does not speak;  and  that  the  appellant
    denied having ever seen it.  The SSHD does not show that those  reasons
    are legally inadequate.

 8. The judge had the advantage of hearing directly from the appellant  and
    other witnesses.  He explained why, based primarily on  that  evidence,
    he found the appellant to pose no risk of re-offending,  and  hence  no
    present threat.  His observation at the end of [26], "I do not see  how
    the respondent could  possibly  believe  that  the  appellant  poses  a
    present threat", may sound rather emphatic, in a case which looks  more
    finely balanced; but even if it was capable of  being  resolved  either
    way, the grounds resolve into no more than insistence and disagreement.



 9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

10. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
