Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr M Iqbal, Counsel instructed by Augustine Clement


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 1st August 1979  and  the
    husband of Ms Temituokpe Tonweh, a British citizen born on 6th February
    1983, and he applied for entry clearance to come to the United  Kingdom
    for settlement as the spouse of the sponsor.

 2. The application was made on 7th May 2013 and the respondent refused the
    appellant's application on 14th August 2013.

 3. The  issue  of  the  relationship  was  conceded  by  the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer at the hearing on 11th August 2014 before  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Aujla who  allowed the appeal finding that  the
    sponsor had shown sufficient income to meet the financial  requirements
    in paragraphs E-ECP.3.2. to E-ECP.3.4. of Appendix FM which requires an
    income threshold of ï¿½18,600 for a partner  to  be  met.   Following  an
    application for permission to appeal by  the  Secretary  of  State  the
    decision of Judge Aujla was set aside and the decision was remade.  For
    reasons given in the previous decision  promulgated  on  23rd  December
    2015 the matter was dismissed under the  Immigration  Rules.   However,
    Judge Aujla had not addressed the issue in  relation  to  Human  Rights
    which had been included in the grounds of appeal before the First  Tier
    Tribunal.

 4. In the absence of any objections written representations  were  invited
    by the parties on the human  rights  issues  alone.  Axiomatic  to  the
    decision  which  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal,  was   that   the
    maintenance requirements of the Immigration Rules were not met.

 5. In the written submissions the appellant's  representative,  Mr  Iqbal,
    asserted that the matter should be considered on an 'old  style'  human
    rights basis, applying the five stage Razgar  v  SSHD  [2004]  UKHL  27
    approach. There is no intermediate test  R (MM& Othrs)  v  SSHD  [2014]
    EWCA Civ 985 and it was clear that there was a  need  to  look  at  the
    evidence to see if there  was  anything  which  had  not  already  been
    adequately considered. Izuazu (Article 8 new rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT
    45 confirmed that the  requirement  for  exceptional  circumstances  or
    insurmountable  obstacles  had  been  authoritatively  declared  to  be
    erroneous one in the Article 8 Immigration  context  by  the  House  of
    Lords (now the Supreme Court) (Huang [2007] UKHL EB Kosovo [2008]  UKHL
    41 and by the Court of Appeal in VW (Uganda) [2009] EWCA Civ 5.

 6. It was submitted that the sponsor is  now  pregnant  and  had  provided
    ample evidence of her visits to the respondent in Nigeria. There was no
    suggestion that family life did not exist.   The  fourth  question  was
    that there was no issue about the interests of national security public
    safety, prevention of crime, the protection of health or morals or  for
    the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.  With  regards  to
    economic wellbeing of  the  country,  the  appellant's  sponsor  is  in
    gainful employment.  It was only a technical  point  that  the  Sponsor
    fell short of meeting the Immigration Rules.

 7.  Ms  Isherwood  on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State  submitted  a
    chronology.  This showed that the appellant had entered  the  UK  as  a
    visitor in 2005, remained as an overstayer  and  in  2010  applied  for
    leave to remain  on  humanitarian  and  compassionate  grounds.    That
    application was refused on 13th December 2010 and was unchallenged.  On
    17th September 2011 the appellant and sponsor were married and on  11th
    June 2012 the appellant applied for leave to remain as a  spouse  of  a
    settled person.  That application was refused and a further application
    on the same grounds was found to be invalid.  The appellant was  served
    with a notice of liability for removal and left the UK  voluntarily  on
    30th April 2013 and made an application for entry clearance  which  was
    refused on 14th August 2013 and is the subject of this appeal.

Conclusions

 8. The date for the purposes of my decision on human rights is 14th August
    2013, AS Somalia v ECO Addis Ababa [2009] EWCA  Civ  149.   It  is  the
    circumstances appertaining at that date  which  should  be  considered.
    Appendix FM  is  specifically  designed  to  incorporate  issues  under
    Article 8 and I considered whether there were any facts which  had  not
    been addressed, as at that date, by the Secretary of State.

 9. I note that the issue  of  the  genuineness  of  the  relationship  was
    conceded by the Home Office Presenting Officer at  the  hearing  before
    Judge Aujla.  This was not a matter which was taken into  account  when
    the decision by the Entry Clearance  Officer  was  made  and  following
    Singh v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74, I consider the  matter  with  all  the
    relevant circumstances, and apply the five stage Razgar test.

10. I accept that there is family life between the  appellant  and  sponsor
    and that the threshold for  the  engagement  of  such  rights  is  low.
    Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC)  confirms  that
    maintenance of immigration control is not a legitimate  end  in  itself
    but can be construed as an aspect of the economic  well  being  of  the
    country. This is clearly relevant in this case, as the appellant cannot
    fulfil the financial requirements  of the immigration rules and despite
    stiff challenge were not held to be unlawful by the Court of Appeal  in
    R (MM & Others) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985.  It is a requirement that I
    give weight to the position of the respondent as expressed through  the
    Immigration rules.  The fact is that the appellant could not  show  the
    relevant  income  to  meet  the  required  income  set  out  under  the
    Immigration rules.  I do not accept that  the  failure  to  meet  those
    requirements was merely a technicality as the appellant had to show the
    sponsor could demonstrate sufficient income in the six months prior  to
    the decision made and could not.   I therefore turn to  the  assessment
    of proportionality.

11. In relation to the proportionality and balancing exercise, I must  also
    take into account Section 117 of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum
    Act 2002 which applies to those seeking entry clearance.  Under Section
    117B the public interest considerations  applicable  in  all  cases  in
    relation to Article 8 are as follows:



            (1)The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
           public interest.

           (2)It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
           able to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

           (a)are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

           (b)are better able to integrate into society.

           (3)It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
           financially independent, because such persons-

           (a)are not a burden on taxpayers, and

           (b)are better able to integrate into society.

           (4)Little weight should be given to-

           (a)a private life, or

           (b)a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

           that is established by a person at a time when the person is in
           the United Kingdom unlawfully.

           (5)Little weight should be given to a private life established
           by a person at a time when the person's immigration status is
           precarious.


12. Although I accept  that  the  appellant  and  sponsor  have  a  genuine
    relationship, it is clear that the relationship was formed  at  a  time
    when the appellant was in the UK on a precarious basis as he entered as
    a  visitor  and  subsequently  overstayed.   The  appellant   made   an
    application on 9th November 2010 for leave  to  remain,  but  this  was
    refused on 13th December 2010, and was unchallenged. On 17th  September
    2011 when the appellant and sponsor were  married,  the  appellant  was
    clearly in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

13. On the evidence presented I am not persuaded that the  appellant  would
    not be a burden on the taxpayers for the reasons given  above  (failure
    to fulfil the Immigration
    Rules financial requirements) .   I note that the sponsor is a  British
    citizen and the judgment of  Sanade  (British  children  -  Zambrano  -
    Dereci) [2012] UKUT 00048 (IAC) but  Izuazu (Article  8  -  New  Rules)
    [2013]  UKUT  00045  (IAC)  a  panel  comprising  the  President,  Lord
    Bannatyne and UT Judge Storey clarified that  although  the  respondent
    continued to accept that EU law prevents  the  state  requiring  an  EU
    citizen, which the  sponsor  is,  to  leave  the  UK  nevertheless  the
    respondent "contends with good reason that this is to be  distinguished
    from a case where an independent adult  can  choose  between  continued
    residence in the UK or continued cohabitation abroad."

14. It is open to the appellant to make a further application to enter  the
    UK or alternatively, if they wish, to relocate  abroad.   It  is  clear
    that the appellant has family in Nigeria and no reason was shown as  to
    the difficulties which would present regarding relocation.

15. EB Kosovo v SSHD [2008] UKHL 41  confirmed  that  each  case  was  fact
    sensitive and it would be rarely proportionate to order  removal  of  a
    spouse 'if there is a close and genuine bond with the other spouse'  or
    sever a relationship between parent and child.  However, this is not  a
    decision ordering removal and secondly at  the  date  of  the  decision
    there was no child.  Parties to a marriage  cannot  necessarily  choose
    where to establish family life and it is open to a  state  to  regulate
    entry to within  its  borders.  The  sponsor  continues  to  visit  the
    appellant in Nigeria.

16. Following Huang v SSHD [2007] UKHL 11

    'In an article 8 case where this  question  is  reached,  the  ultimate
    question for the appellate immigration authority is whether the refusal
    of leave to enter or remain, in circumstances where  the  life  of  the
    family cannot reasonably be expected to be  enjoyed  elsewhere,  taking
    full account of all considerations weighing in favour of  the  refusal,
    prejudices the family life of the applicant in  a  manner  sufficiently
    serious to amount to a breach of the  fundamental  right  protected  by
    article 8. If the answer to this question is affirmative,  the  refusal
    is unlawful and the authority must so decide. It is not necessary  that
    the appellate immigration authority, directing itself along  the  lines
    indicated in this opinion, need ask in addition whether the case  meets
    a test of exceptionality'.

17. For the reasons given above I find that  neither  the  family  nor  the
    private life, (indeed the matter was presented on the basis  of  family
    life and following Patel and ors  v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72  that Article 8
    is not a general dispensing power), of the appellant is prejudiced in a
    manner sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of human rights.

Notice of Decision

The appellant's appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds.

Signed                                             Date 30th April 2015
