For the Respondent:    Miss S Leatherland, Home Office Presenting Officer

For the purpose of assessing adequacy of maintenance by reference to state
benefits, the standard amount of Income Support, or Jobseeker's Allowance
is the starting point for the able bodied: KA and others (Adequacy of
Maintenance) Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065 applied.

Where a sponsor has disabilities it should be assumed that enhanced
benefits, such as a higher rate of Income Support, or Disability Living
Allowance, have been awarded out of necessity and are not available to
support dependants coming from abroad.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant is a citizen of Somalia,  born  on  12  July  2004.   He
    applied from Ethiopia to the respondent  for  entry  clearance  to  the
    United Kingdom as a spouse.

2.    His wife is his sponsor.  She has been recognised as a refugee by  the
    United Kingdom.  She is deaf and dumb and lives in the  United  Kingdom
    with her sister, SG.  The sponsor's sister is a British citizen, having
    come here as a refugee.  The sponsor arrived in August 2000 with  other
    siblings, including her brother MG who is also deaf and dumb.  SG cares
    for both the appellant and her brother.   According  to  the  statement
    made by SG for the Immigration Judge' s hearing, the appellant, who  is
    living in Djibouti, came to the notice of the sponsor in 2003 after  MG
    travelled there.  The appellant was a childhood friend of the sponsor's
    family.  It is said that when the sponsor came to live in the  UK,  she
    had been disappointed  that  the  appellant  did  not  accompany  them.
    After his visit, MG brought  back  photographs,  which  he  showed  the
    sponsor, who became obsessed by them.   The  family  eventually  agreed
    that the appellant could marry the sponsor, provided he first travelled
    to  Ethiopia  and  spoke  to  the  sponsor's  mother.    Despite   some
    reluctance, her mother agreed to the wedding.

3.    After the wedding,  the  appellant  applied  for  entry  clearance  to
    enable him to come to the United Kingdom as 'the  spouse  of  a  person
    settled here'.  That application was refused on 7  December  2005.  The
    appellant appealed.

4.    The relevant immigration rule is Paragraph 281 of HC 395.  So  far  as
    relevant it reads:-
           281. The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to
        enter the United Kingdom with a view to settlement as the spouse
        ... of a person present and settled in the United Kingdom ... are
        that:
        (i) (a) the applicant is married to ... a person present and
        settled in the United Kingdom ... or
        (b...; and


        (iii) each of the parties intends to live permanently with the
        other as his or her spouse and the marriage is subsisting; and


        (iv) there will be adequate accommodation for the parties and any
        dependants without recourse to public funds in accommodation which
        they own or occupy exclusively; and


        (v) the parties will be able to maintain themselves and any
        dependants adequately without recourse to public funds; and


        (vi) ....


5.    In a determination, promulgated on 24 October 2006, Immigration  Judge
    Kelsey accepted that the marriage was genuine and subsisting.  He  also
    accepted that there would be adequate accommodation available  for  the
    appellant, without recourse to public funds.

6.    The Immigration  Judge  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  and
    sponsor could adequately maintain and support  themselves  without  any
    additional recourse to public funds, the  sponsor  living  entirely  on
    benefits  at  the  date  of  decision.   The  Immigration  Judge  heard
    argument, based on an  old  Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal  case,  Uvovo
    00/TH/01450, to the effect that as the sponsor  was  already  receiving
    income which was at a higher level  than  the  amount  of  job  seekers
    allowance paid to a married couple the appellant and sponsor  would  be
    able to maintain and support themselves without any additional recourse
    to public  funds.    He  did  not  accept  that  argument  because  the
    appellant's income is derived from income support,  plus  an  allowance
    because of her disabilities.   He  recognised  that  Uvovo  dealt  with
    income (by which he meant earned income) which was not a  large  amount
    but which was higher than  the  income  support  level  for  a  married
    couple.   He said this case was different.  In his words:

          "It stands to reason, it seems to me,  that  a  single  person  in
         receipt of certain benefits has  those  benefits  assessed  on  the
         basis that she is a single person and needs that  amount  of  money
         for her situation".


    He went on to say that, unless the appellant had a separate income  the
    appellant and sponsor would,  as  a  married  couple,  be  entitled  to
    reassessment and therefore higher benefits than  the  sponsor  receives
    now.  He also said that there must be an exception to the  decision  in
    Uvovo for a person who has additional  benefits  for  medical  reasons.
    He did not accept that the principle in Uvovo applied to the  facts  in
    this particular appeal.  He also said that if, as the sponsor had said,
    they wished to make an application  for  separate  accommodation,  that
    would give rise to further assessments being  made  and  an  inevitable
    increase in the award of public funds.

7.    The grounds in support of the  application  for  review  attack  those
    findings,   making  a  number  of  different  points.    First,  it  is
    suggested that the Immigration Judge erred in law by  speculating  what
    the position might be if, at some future point, the couple applied  for
    separate accommodation.   Second, it was asserted that the  Immigration
    Judge had erred in failing to apply Uvovo, saying that  the  principles
    had been restated in KA and others (Adequacy of  Maintenance)  Pakistan
    [2006] UKAIT 00065.  Third (but Mr Nathan did not proceed with this) it
    was argued that the Immigration Judge had failed to take  into  account
    evidence that the sponsor  lived  frugally  and  regularly  sent  money
    abroad to the appellant.

8.    In addition to those specific grounds, a number of generalised  points
    were made.   First,  that the  disability  benefit  which  the  sponsor
    received was not ring fenced, in other words it could be spent  as  she
    chose.  Second, there was evidence that  the  appellant  would  be  the
    sponsor's carer.   It was also said  that  there  had  been  no  direct
    evidence, or any evidence, from which it might  be  inferred  that  the
    Disability Living Allowance was actually spent by the  sponsor  on  her
    disability and therefore that it would not be available for the couple.
     Finally, the grounds argued that the couple would not be  entitled  to
    reassessment and higher benefits because the  appellant  would  not  be
    entitled to apply for at least six months.   (There was no evidence  to
    support that last assertion).  The grounds say  the  Immigration  Judge
    applied the wrong test and should merely have  asked  what  income  was
    available to the couple, as at the date of  decision,  and  whether  it
    would be adequate.

9.     Mr  Nathan's  first  argument  was  that  the   Immigration   Judge's
    arithmetic was wrong, and such a fundamental error amounted to an error
    of law.   He said the usual Job Seekers Allowance for a single  person,
    aged twenty five or over, was �57.45  per  week  but,  because  of  her
    disability, the appellant received an enhanced figure  of  �70.00.   In
    addition,  she  received  the  carer's  element  of  Disability  Living
    Allowance at �16.50 per week, and the  mobility  aspect  of  Disability
    Living Allowance at �16.50 per week,  that made a total  weekly  figure
    of �103.00.  He said this  should  be  compared  with  the  normal  job
    seekers allowance for couples of �90.10.  He argued that, put that way,
    it is clear that the  sponsor  received  more  than  was  necessary  to
    maintain a couple.   He  argued  that  the  extra  amount  required  to
    maintain the appellant (as assessed by the government) is �90.10  minus
    �57.45 being �32.65.   He said that, if the  amount  is  calculated  in
    that way, then the appellant and the sponsor have sufficient  funds  to
    enable the appellant to be maintained without any further  recourse  to
    public funds.

10.    Although it was not referred to by the Immigration Judge,   the  then
    current reported case on this issue was KA.  The headnote says:-

         "The requirement of adequacy is objective.  The level of income and
         other benefits that will be available if the  family  were  drawing
         income support remains the yardstick."


11.   The first thing we needed to decide was whether, when looking  at  the
    sponsor's income the Immigration Judge should only have considered  the
    basic income support level, or whether it was appropriate  to  consider
    the whole of the sponsor's benefits.  The latter would be considered on
    the basis that the  benefits  are  paid  to  her  as  being  necessary.
    Mr Nathan argued that the  Disability  Living  Allowance  of  �33  was
    available to the sponsor to spend as she  wished.   He  said  that,  at
    present,  the sponsor's sister is her  carer,  but  he  was  unable  to
    demonstrate that the �16.50, paid for help with the sponsor's care, was
    handed to her sister.  Unless it was, it is reasonable to  assume  that
    the sponsor used it for other expenses arising from her disability.  If
    so, it would not be available to spend on the  appellant,  even  if  he
    took over as carer.  At the date of decision, the proposal was that the
    appellant would go to live in the house occupied by the sponsor and her
    sister and brother.  Her sister and brother did not have anywhere  else
    to go.

12.   KA, and before it Uvovo, compare a low earning sponsor's  income  with
    income support levels.   In this  case  we  are  asked  to  regard  the
    enhanced benefits received by the sponsor in the same way as  earnings,
    with the Disability Living Allowance almost in  the  form  of  a  bonus
    which the sponsor could spend in any way she chose.

13.   The government  does  not  provide  "bonuses"  to  the  recipients  of
    benefits.  The �33.00  Disability  Living  Allowance  is  paid  to  the
    sponsor because she is perceived as having greater needs for funds than
    an able bodied person.   We do not accept that KA was  intended  to  be
    authority for the proposition that Disability Living  Allowance  is  an
    extra amount of money which a person may or may  not  need  and  which,
    together with the enhanced income support, would put the sponsor in the
    position that she had more funds than the joint  income  support  level
    which is the minimum level for an able bodied couple

14.   At paragraph 7 of KA the Tribunal said:-

         "7.       There is a good reason for using  the  levels  of  income
         support as a test.  The reason is that income support is the  level
         of income provided by the United Kingdom Government  to  those  who
         have no other source of income.   It follows  from  that  that  the
         respondent could not properly argue that a family who have as  much
         as they would have on income support is not adequately maintained.


        8. It perhaps does not necessarily  follow  that  in  order  to  be
         adequately maintained one has to have resources at least equivalent
         to those which would be available to a family  on  income  support.
         But there are very good reasons for taking that view.   The  family
         of British (or EU) citizens resident in this country will not  have
         less than that level.  It is extremely undesirable that  the  rules
         should be interpreted in  such  a  way  as  to  envisage  immigrant
         families existing (and  hence  being  required  to  exist,  because
         social security benefits are not available to  them)  on  resources
         less than those which will be available through the social security
         system to citizen families.   To do so is  to  encourage  the  view
         that immigrant families need less, or can be expected  to  live  on
         less, and in certain areas of the country will be prone  to  create
         whole communities living at a lower standard than even the  poorest
         of British citizens.   It is for  this  reason  that  a  number  of
         Tribunal cases .... have held that the basic task for an  appellant
         attempting to show that their maintenance will be "adequate" is  to
         show that they will have as much as they would have  if  they  were
         able to claim income support.  Similar considerations apply to  the
         different benefit structure where there is a disabled person in the
         family... There have been one or two  cases  which  have  indicated
         that a frugal lifestyle can  be  taken  into  account  in  deciding
         whether maintenance will be "adequate", in  our  view  those  cases
         should not be followed.  In particular we  doubt  whether  it  will
         ever be right to say that children can be  maintained  "adequately"
         at less than the level which will  be  available  to  a  family  on
         income support, merely because one of their  parents  asserts  that
         the family will live frugally.   The purpose of the requirement for
         adequacy is to ensure that a  proper  standard,  appropriate  to  a
         family living in a not inexpensive western society, is available to
         those who seek to live here."


15.   That extract fortifies our view that where there is reference  in  the
    authorities to income support, that should  be  taken  to  include  any
    enhanced income support and other benefits arising, for example, out of
    any disability.  Such enhanced benefit is provided by the state because
    it is needed.  A level of income below that enhanced level,  would  not
    be adequate for such an individual with those disabilities.

16.   The minimum  required by the appellant  and  her  spouse  to  maintain
    themselves  is the amount paid to the appellant plus the  extra  amount
    that would be paid to them as a couple (ie �103 +  �32.65  =  �135.65).
    In other words, the  sponsor  needs  all  that  she  receives  and  the
    appellant cannot  adequately  be  maintained  from  the  sum  presently
    received by her.

17.   If the disability living allowance could have been discounted  as  not
    necessary for  the  sponsor  to  live  on,  the  appellant  could  have
    succeeded because the amount needed for him is �32.65, which is 35p per
    week less than the Disability Living Allowance.

18.   Disability Living Allowance is there to help  towards  necessary  care
    and necessary extra mobility expenses arising from the disability.   It
    is awarded after the completion of a complex form  and  an  assessment,
    often including a medical assessment.  Even if the sponsor did not  use
    all of it (and it is only �33.00 per week) it has not been demonstrated
    that she does not have a need for it.  For the reasons adumbrated in KA
    it is inappropriate to disregard that benefit even if the  sponsor  was
    claiming to live frugally and not to use it.

19.   The Immigration Judge made  no  error  of  law  in  finding  that  the
    appellant cannot be maintained in the United Kingdom  without  recourse
    to public funds.

20.   Having made that  decision  we  do  not  need  to  go  into  the  more
    problematic area  of  whether  the  appellant  would,  on  arrival,  be
    entitled to benefits.  Nor do we need to decide whether Rule 6A  of  HC
    395 means that any prospective increase  in  benefits  payable  to  the
    sponsor would prevent the appellant from establishing that he could  be
    maintained without recourse to public funds.   As Mr  Nathan  said,  it
    may be that the meaning of the last clause of paragraph 6A has not  yet
    been litigated.   This was not the opportunity to do so.

21.   The Immigration Judge made no material error of law in his  assessment
    of the maintenance requirements of the Immigration Rules.

   22. The original decision shall stand -


             The appeal is dismissed.
