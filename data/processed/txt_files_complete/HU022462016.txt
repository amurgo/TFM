                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Hussain, Trent Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


      1. Permission to appeal was sought and granted on the  basis  that  it
         was arguable the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  fell  into  arguable
         procedural error, in essence, in failing to grant an adjournment on
         her own motion  because  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  made  no
         attempt at the hearing to  establish  why  the  appellant  was  not
         legally represented and whether he needed an adjournment to  secure
         representation and whether  he  had  the  respondent's  bundle.  Mr
         Hussain only had a copy of the decision the subject of  appeal  and
         the First-tier Tribunal appeal decision. I gave him the copy  court
         bundle and put the case back for him to consider the documents.


      2. The  appellant  was  diagnosed,  in  Pakistan,  as  suffering  from
         paranoid schizophrenia. The First-tier Tribunal judge set  out  the
         appellant's family history and the appellant's own medical history,
         detailed the medication he is on and the support he receives in the
         UK both from the Mental Health Team  in  Hillingdon  and  from  his
         brother. She referred to the appellant's studies and recorded  that
         he attended unrepresented but with his  brother.  She  describes  a
         letter in support written by the brother as a witness statement and
         this is one of the matters that Mr Hussain submitted was indicative
         of a failure on the part of the judge which would not have occurred
         had the appellant been legally represented.


      3. Further alleged failings were:


          i) The judge did not identify whether the appellant had seen  the
             respondent's bundle when, according to the  brother's  witness
             statement, he had not;
         ii) The judge did not identify whether the appellant had  filed  a
             bundle of documents;
        iii) The judge made no enquiry whether  the  appellant  had  sought
             legal advice, why he had not if he hadn't or why  he  had  not
             obtained it if he had;
         iv) The judge failed to take account of  the  appellant's  suicide
             attempt when considering whether he was vulnerable;
          v) The judge failed to have  adequate  regard  to  the  appellant
             being  a  vulnerable  witness  and  excluded  the  appellant's
             brother whilst the appellant was giving  evidence,  which  she
             should not have done;
         vi) That  despite  the  impression  given  in  the  decision,  the
             appellant was not assisted by the judge in giving evidence.


      4. In support of the appeal before me the brother had filed a  witness
         statement. In that statement, he says ([4]) that he had not filed a
         witness statement to the First-tier Tribunal,  yet  later  in  that
         witness statement he refers to a witness statement  filed  by  him.
         What he actually filed was a document headed Letter of Support. The
         record of evidence made by the First-tier Tribunal judge refers  to
         the brother stating that he had a prepared statement and there were
         things he wanted to say. The document in question is headed "Letter
         of Support" and concludes by describing him  as  a  'deponent'  and
         that 'what ever stated above is true to the best  of  my  knowledge
         and  belief'.  Although  not  a  witness  statement  in  the  sense
         understood by solicitors and barristers, it is plain  that  it  set
         out matters he wished the judge to take into account and  which  he
         amplified during his oral evidence.


      5. It is correct that the judge has not recorded whether the appellant
         had the respondent's bundle. Mr Hussain did not have a copy of  the
         respondent's bundle - it is unclear  why  Trent  Chambers  had  not
         requested a copy of the  bundle  given  they  had  apparently  been
         representing (or at least involved with)  the  appellant  since  at
         least 8th August 2017. The respondent's  bundle  included  previous
         decisions taken by the respondent, various medical  documents,  the
         application form and the decision the subject  of  appeal.  All  of
         those documents would have been available to the appellant  or  his
         brother (given his brother is assisting the appellant and they live
         in the same household) or would have been known  to  the  appellant
         and his brother. In any event the judge, where she refers to  them,
         accepts their veracity and places weight upon  them.  None  of  the
         documents are challenged by the respondent and none  are  taken  as
         adverse to the appellant's account.


      6. Although the judge did not state in terms that  the  appellant  had
         filed a bundle of  documents,  she  referred  in  her  decision  to
         documents relied upon by the appellant. There is no  submission  by
         Mr Hussain that the judge overlooked a document or failed to  place
         adequate weight upon particular documents.


      7. It appears from the papers that solicitors had charged  �2,500  for
         work done up to the point of the refusal and thereafter required  a
         payment of �800 in order to continue to act. Those letters can only
         have come into the possession of the  Tribunal  if  they  had  been
         provided  by  the  appellant.  The  appeal  form  stated  that  the
         appellant did not have a disability requiring special arrangements.
          The brother's witness  statement  provided  with  the  application
         seeking permission to appeal states ([4]) that despite his  efforts
         to find a solicitor, he could not find one on legal aid and he  had
         no funds and therefore he was a litigant in person. It  is  correct
         that the judge has not recorded asking about legal  representation,
         but  it  is  apparent  from  the  papers  that  the  applicant  had
         previously had legal advice and had been asked for a very large sum
         of money for legal advice to continue. The judge records there  was
         no request for an adjournment to obtain legal  representation.  The
         brother's witness statement provided for the permission application
         makes plain he has been unable to find  legal  representation  even
         though it does not set out the attempts actually made. It is  clear
         that, even if the judge had asked about legal representation,  none
         was available; no reason is given now and  no  indication  of  what
         attempts had been made to find legal representation. On that basis,
         the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal  judge  would,  in  any
         event, have proceeded.


      8. The judge records the  evidence  about  the  suicide  attempt.  She
         records the brother's evidence about the suicide attempt and refers
         to a lack of clarity as to how long the appellant was  in  hospital
         as an informal patient or  whether  he  was  sectioned.  The  judge
         accepts there was a suicide  attempt  and  notes  that  no  medical
         reason for this was advanced. I see from  the  medical  records  at
         that time that the appellant had legal advisors - MTG solicitors to
         whom the decision letter of 5th January 2016 was sent.


      9. The judge, according to the brother's  witness  statement  excluded
         him from the hearing whilst the appellant gave  evidence.  That  is
         not apparent from the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  or  the
         Record of Proceedings but I have treated the brother's assertion to
         that effect as correct. The appellant, despite having said  he  was
         not, is plainly a vulnerable witness. That it was incorrect for the
         brother to be excluded does not necessarily follow; much depends on
         the appellant's state of health at that time  and  his  ability  to
         cope with the proceedings. There is nothing to suggest that he  had
         difficulties giving evidence. The judge refers in her determination
         to the ability of the appellant to study: he had entered the UK  as
         a student on 6th January 2010  and  his  leave  extended  until  30
         September  2014  albeit  it  was  curtailed  subsequently  to  14th
         February 2014; and that the medical evidence is that  his  symptoms
         are generally controlled albeit he needs  assistance  in  terms  of
         appointments and taking medication in addition to some  input  from
         community  health  services.  There  is  limited  evidence  of  the
         appellant having any kind  of  relapse  or  anxiety  or  additional
         difficulties after the hearing; the brother  said  he  was  tearful
         after the hearing but no medical evidence of any significant  after
         effects was provided. In any event, there is nothing in the grounds
         to indicate that the evidence would have been  any  different.  The
         judge  accepts  the  appellant's  evidence  and   the   documentary
         evidence. The brother in his witness statement is disagreeing  with
         the judge's finding that  there  is  contact  with  the  family  in
         Pakistan. Although the submission by Mr Hussain  is  that  had  the
         appellant been able to give evidence with support as  a  vulnerable
         witness, that finding may have been different is  not  sustainable.
         In  reaching  that  finding  the  judge  considers  not  only   the
         appellant's evidence  but  also  the  brother's  evidence  that  he
         provides financial support for his family in Pakistan and that  the
         brother visits Pakistan.


     10. Although the brother's witness statement asserts that he  does  not
         believe that the appellant's evidence was  coherent,  there  is  no
         indication how the evidence given  could  have  been  different.  I
         asked Mr Hussain if he wished to amend his  grounds  of  appeal  to
         include a challenge on the basis that other evidence was  available
         which, had the appellant been  treated  as  a  vulnerable  witness,
         would have been put before the First-tier Tribunal but  he  had  no
         instructions.


     11. A judge must take particular care when an appellant or  witness  is
         vulnerable  and  must  comply  with  the  guidance  given  by   the
         Immigration and Asylum Chamber - see AM (Afghanistan)  [2017]  EWCA
         Civ 1123; there are elements to the hearing  where  the  First-tier
         Tribunal judge may have fallen short. But  the  fact  is  that  the
         judge accepted all the evidence save  for  the  brother's  evidence
         that the appellant had no-one to return to in Pakistan who would be
         able to provide an appropriate level of care.  The  judge  did  not
         accept that, on the basis of the evidence before her,  for  reasons
         that were open to her. They were not perverse or irrational.


     12. The judge considered relevant jurisprudence and reached findings on
         the evidence which were open to her. The judge  was  clear  in  her
         findings as to the availability of medical and familial support  in
         Pakistan. She approached the issue of proportionality on the  basis
         of the evidence at its  highest  save  for  the  finding  from  the
         brother's evidence. There is no material error of law and I dismiss
         the appeal.


    Conclusions:


    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.


    I do not set  aside  the  decision;  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal stands.
