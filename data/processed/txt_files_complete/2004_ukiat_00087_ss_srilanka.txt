                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The Appellant, a citizen of Sri Lanka, appeals with permission against
      the determination of an Adjudicator, Mr D C Gerrey, deciding that  his
      appeal should be  treated  as  abandoned.   Before  us  today,  he  is
      represented by Mr O'Callaghan,  instructed  by  Theva  &  Co  and  the
      Respondent is represented by Miss Bracken.

   2. As will be apparent from our  description  of  it,  the  Adjudicator's
      determination is of an unusual  nature.   The  Appellant  applied  for
      asylum  on  his  arrival  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  was   granted
      exceptional leave to remain, expiring on 22nd December 2004  which  is
      the day before he achieves majority.  Despite the grant of leave,  the
      Appellant claims to be entitled to be recognised as a refugee.  Before
      the Adjudicator it was clear that there were considerable  lacunae  in
      the evidence supporting that claim.  There was an application  for  an
      adjournment, not resisted by the Secretary of  State  but,  which  the
      Adjudicator  thought  in  the  circumstances  of  the  case  was   not
      appropriate.  The  final  paragraph  of  his  determination  reads  as
      follows;

            "Having considered the application with both representatives and
           having considered the alternatives, I was reluctant to grant the
           adjournment particularly since  it  was  difficult  to  put  any
           timescale on investigations which might have to be conducted  in
           Sri Lanka.  In view of the fact  that  the  Appellant  had  been
           granted leave to remain for the next two years, was  ample  time
           for  investigations  to  be  carried  out  without  the   appeal
           remaining listed.  In any event, if removal directions were  set
           in December 2004, the Appellant would then have a fresh right of
           appeal on  human  rights  grounds.    It  was  agreed  with  the
           representatives that, in all the circumstances, there was little
           point in adjourning the appeal when there was no  indication  as
           to when it would be ready for hearing.  It was  felt  preferable
           for the Appellant to have ample time to prepare a  fresh  appeal
           when all evidence was available, whether before or at  the  same
           time  as  any  human  rights  appeal  might   arise.    In   the
           circumstances, both representatives agreed that I  should  treat
           the  appeal  as  abandoned,  and  I  agreed  that  this  was  an
           appropriate course.


            Decision.  Appeal treated as abandoned".


      And the Adjudicator's signature follows.


   3. We are entirely confident that  that  paragraph  indicates  a  serious
      misconception about both the Appellant's appeal and  the  decision  of
      the Court of Appeal in Saad, Dirye and Osorio [2002] Imm  AR  34.   As
      Saad's case rules, and as the phraseology of both  Section  69(5)  and
      Section 58(9) made clear, the  question  of  whether  a  person  is  a
      refugee is to be determined independently of any grant  to  remain  on
      human rights or exceptional grounds.

   4. The Adjudicator's decision in the present  case  effectively  deprived
      the Appellant of his right, in an appeal which was  then  pending,  to
      assert that (whatever else the Secretary of State might grant him)  he
      was entitled to recognition as a refugee.  We note  the  Adjudicator's
      record of both parties agreeing the course of action he proposed.   It
      is clear to us that  there  was  on  one,  two  or  three  sides  some
      misunderstanding about what precisely was being proposed and what  was
      agreed.  In the circumstances, we do not consider that the Tribunal or
      the parties are bound by  the  agreement  which  is  there  apparently
      recorded.

   5. The Appellant's asylum appeal therefore remains outstanding and  needs
      to be heard by an Adjudicator.  No doubt the parties will bear in mind
      that there has now been a very considerable period of time  since  the
      Adjudicator's determination.  It must be that any  evidence  which  is
      ever going to be available to support  the  Appellant's  asylum  claim
      either is now ready or very shortly will be ready.

   6. In  any  event,  this  appeal  is  allowed  and  we  direct  that  the
      Appellant's appeal be heard afresh by an Adjudicator with the  consent
      of the parties.  We indicate that that should be Mr Gerrey if that  is
      reasonably practicable.
