                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The appellant is a national of Somalia. She married her sponsor in
      Ethiopia on 27 February 2012. His family originally are from Somalia
      and came to the United Kingdom as refugees. They were granted status
      and her sponsor joined them when he was in his mid teens. He was
      granted settlement in 2002.He now holds British nationality. Because
      of her marriage she was admitted to the United Kingdom on 27 March
      2013, with leave valid until 6 November 2015. As yet they do not have
      any children.


   2. On 12 October 2015 she applied for further leave to remain. Her
      application was refused on 27 November 2015.

   3. The application had been considered under appendix FM of the
      immigration rules. It was accepted the relationship with genuine and
      subsisting. There were no suitability issues. Her sponsor worked as a
      bus driver and earned in excess of ï¿½26,000 per annum which met the
      financial requirements.

   4. As all the necessary bank statements and corresponding wage slips had
      not been produced the evidential requirements of appendix FM SE was
      not met. This was the primary basis for refusal.

   5.  The respondent considered EX1 under the 10-year route but concluded
      there was no reason why family life could not continue in Somalia.
      Regarding paragraph 2768 ADE and private life the appellant had not
      been here the necessary 20 years. The respondent did not see why she
      could not reintegrate into Somalia.

The First tier Tribunal

   6. Her appeal was heard before First-tier Judge R L Walker on 14 February
      2017. The parties were represented. The appellant and her sponsor gave
      evidence. All the necessary wage slips and bank statements were still
      not available and the appellant's representative unsuccessfully sought
      an adjournment. The judge took the view that they had had adequate
      time to prepare.


   7. The judge accepted that the sponsor's earnings based upon a letter
      from the employer and the cumulative total shown on the wage slip was
      as stated. However, the judge concluded that the evidential
      requirements of appendix FM-SE were not met and that this was a
      mandatory requirement.


   8. The judge dismissed the appeal. At paragraph 22 of the decision it was
      stated:

         In assessing the Appellant's human rights claims the issue as to
         whether she can satisfy the requirements of the immigration rules
         forms are very important and crucial part of the proportionality
         exercise. As she has failed to satisfy the rules then any human
         rights claim must also fail especially as there is no immediate
         prospect of the Appellant being removed.


   9. Regarding her private life at paragraph 23 the judge stated:


         With regard to private life the appellant has failed to show that
         there would be very significant obstacles to her integration into
         Somalia if she had to return. It may well be her choice to want to
         remain in the United Kingdom but she has not put forward any clear
         of (sic-`or') specific reasons which would amount to very
         significant obstacles.


The Upper Tribunal.

  10. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis it was arguable the
      judge had not applied the Razgar sequential approach.


  11. At the outset of the hearing Mr. Clarke, Home Office Presenting
      Officer, conceded that in his view the decision materially erred in
      law and could not stand.

Consideration

  12. The grounds of appeal were restricted to human rights considerations.
      I had some concern that the judge may not have appreciated this
      because at the end it was indicated the appeal was dismissed under the
      immigration rules with no reference to article 8. Furthermore, beyond
      a generic reference at paragraph 7, there was no specific
      consideration of section 117 B. However, the judge does correctly
      state the position at paragraph 22 whereby the appeal must be
      considered through the prism of the rules.


  13. It is apparent the judge concluded that because she had not met the
      rules the appeal must fail. The way Paragraph 22 is phrased would
      suggests that because the rules were not met that was the end of the
      matter. It is now established that the rules are not a complete code
      and regard must be had to any other considerations which would render
      the decision in breach of article 8. The reference to the fact the
      appellant is not facing immediate removal does not remove the
      obligation to consider these factors.

  14. The decision does not follow the Razgar sequential approach and the
      relevant consideration cannot be implied. There is no evaluation of
      the situation in Somalia and the reality of married life continuing
      there. Overall, the decision does not set out the factors which make
      the decision proportionate beyond stating the immigration rules are
      not met. Consequently, I am satisfied that the decision materially
      errs in law and cannot stand. Both representatives are in agreement
      with this conclusion.

Disposal

  15. The standard Upper Tribunal Directions contain the presumption that
      the Upper Tribunal will remake the decision on the same occasion if it
      is set aside. I pointed out the fact the appeal related to an
      application made in October 2015 and the relationship was accepted.
      The First Tier judge had accepted the sponsor's earnings which exceed
      the financial requirements in the rules. His employer was in good
      standing. However the representatives indicated they were not in a
      position to proceed immediately and suggested the matter be relisted
      in the First tier Tribunal so that more information could be led, such
      as the current situation in Somalia.


   Decision


   The decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal R L Walker dismissing
   the appeal materially errs in law and is set aside. The appeal is
   remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo hearing.
