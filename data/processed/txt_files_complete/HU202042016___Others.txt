Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr T Bahja, of Counsel instructed by Messrs Lords
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants appeal, with permission against a decision of  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Nightingale who, in a determination promulgated
    on 25 August 2017, dismissed their appeals against the decisions of the
    respondent dated 22  July  2016  refusing  them  entry  to  Britain  as
    dependent children with discretionary leave to remain.

2.   The first two appellants are the daughters of the  sponsor,  [MM],  who
    came to Britain in 2006 as a student and thereafter overstayed.  She at
    present has limited leave to remain on the basis  of  her  marriage  to
    [HU], a British citizen.  They have two  daughters  born  in  2009  and
    2010.

3.   The first two appellants were born on 16 July 2001 and  8  March  2004.
    The third appellant is the nephew of the sponsor  who  was  born  on  5
    November 2014.  The children were therefore 15, 12 and 2 at the date of
    the  decision,  they  having  applied  sometime   before   that   date.
    Interviews appear to have taken place in April 2016.  They were refused
    under the Rules because the financial requirements of the  Rules  could
    not be met and because it was not accepted that the  sponsor's  partner
    earned the required income of ï¿½27,200.  The refusal notice also  stated
    that the Entry Clearance Officer, while accepting that  the  first  two
    appellants were related to their mother, was  not  satisfied  that  the
    evidence provided showed that she had sole responsibility for  them  or
    that she was in  regular  contact  with  them  and  their  guardian  in
    Tanzania.  No details had been provided as to the whereabouts of  their
    father or what part he played in their life and it was stated  that  it
    was considered that they had an established family life in Tanzania and
    there was no reason why that could not continue.

4.   The judge considered evidence from the sponsor and her husband  and  in
    paragraph 12 noted that it was the sponsor's evidence that although she
    arrived in Britain in 2006 she had visited Tanzania later that year and
    had visited again in January 2010 for nine months and in November 2014.
     She had first made attempts to get visas for the three  appellants  in
    2014 and then asked a friend, [G], to be the  guardian  for  the  three
    children - the third appellant was the son of a "cousin sister" who had
    looked after the sponsor's own  two  children  when  she  had  come  to
    Britain in 2006.  The sponsor's two daughters were in a boarding school
    but would holiday with [G].

5.   The judge set out the relevant law and at  paragraphs  26  onwards  set
    out her findings of fact and her reasons.  She  correctly  stated  that
    she "had an eye" to their best  interests  and  welfare  as  a  primary
    consideration.  She stated that they could not meet the requirements of
    the Immigration Rules for entry.  The specified documents had not  been
    produced to show that the financial requirements  could  be  met.   The
    judge pointed out that the sponsor was not settled and that her husband
    did not meet the definition of parent as set out in paragraph 6 of  the
    Immigration Rules as there was no indication that the children's father
    was dead.  The sponsor had merely stated that she  is  unaware  of  the
    whereabouts or  circumstances  of  the  first  and  second  appellant's
    father.  The judge pointed the third appellant's father was  alive  and
    had written an affidavit in support of the appeal.   The  judge  stated
    that the third appellant must fail under the Rules as the  sponsor  was
    not his parent and that the family relationship was  not  evidenced  on
    the documents, although the judge said that she was prepared to  accept
    that the third appellant's mother was the niece of the sponsor.   There
    was no evidence moreover of any adoption, legal or  de  facto,  of  the
    third appellant by the sponsor.

6.   The judge stated that she was satisfied that since at least  2014  when
    the third appellant's  mother  had  died,  the  sponsor  had  had  sole
    responsibility for the first and second appellants' upbringing and that
    the  sponsor  and  her  husband  made  the  major  decisions  for   the
    appellants.  She noted the communication with  the  children's  schools
    since 2015 but stated that it appeared that [G] - the friend with  whom
    the children were living  -  had  taken  on  day-to-day  care  for  the
    appellants and also that the first and second appellants  had  been  at
    boarding school and consequently their care had  been  largely  in  the
    hands of teachers and educational  professionals  rather  than  in  the
    hands of the sponsor.

7.   The judge accepted that the sponsor had  taken  on  responsibility  for
    the third appellant and that  insofar  as  a  child  of  2  needed  any
    assistance  she  would  provide  it.   She  stated  that  there  is   a
    presumption of family life enjoyed between parents and  minor  children
    and she was satisfied that that family life existed and,  to  a  lesser
    extent, that the sponsor took on a caring role for the third appellant.
     She stated that family life had been enjoyed since 2010  by  means  of
    visits and communication through modern methods  but  the  interference
    with family life was not caused by the decision appealed,  but  by  the
    sponsor's decision to leave the children in  2006  and  settle  in  the
    United Kingdom and start a new family  here.   She  accepted  that  the
    sponsor returned to Tanzania to visit her children periodically and had
    stayed with them for extended periods.  However, he  found  that  there
    had been a very considerable delay in making any  application  for  the
    appellants to join her.  There had been no explanation for her decision
    to leave the first and second appellants for most of their lives in the
    care of her niece rather than returning to Tanzania to  care  for  them
    herself, or applying for them to visit her in the United Kingdom.   She
    stated that the Entry Clearance Officer's decision  did  no  more  than
    maintain the status quo.

8.   The judge stated that although she accepted that  ideally  the  sponsor
    and her husband would wish the appellants to join them  in  the  United
    Kingdom, she would regard the decision as proportionate.   She said:-

         "31. ... There is nothing in the circumstances  of  these  children
             which suggests that their welfare  is  adversely  affected  by
             their mother's residence in  the  United  Kingdom.   They  are
             cared  for  and  are  in  education,  the  first  and   second
             appellants, and the third appellant is cared for by  a  family
             friend.   The  first  and  second  appellants  have  lived  in
             Tanzania for  all  their  lives  and  are  familiar  with  the
             country, culture and customs and the education system in which
             they are enrolled.  None of these appellants  appear  to  have
             any health problems beyond the normal childhood  illnesses  to
             be expected.  I accept that they  are  likely  to  be  English
             speakers, since English is one of the  national  languages  of
             Tanzania, but the maintenance requirements of the  Immigration
             Rules cannot be met.  It cannot therefore be said  that  these
             children are self-sufficient.

         32.  I find nothing  unreasonable  in  the  suggestion  that  these
             children continue to enjoy their family life with the  sponsor
             as they have for the past eleven years  which  is  by  way  of
             ongoing contact, family visits and financial support.  It  is,
             of  course,  open  to  these  appellants  to  make   a   fresh
             application once the maintenance requirements are met.  In the
             meantime, I can find nothing on the  circumstances  before  me
             which compels the grant of leave  to  remain  outside  of  the
             Immigration Rules so as to give  effect  to  the  respondent's
             Article 8 obligations.  So far as any  interference  has  been
             caused with family life here, I find it to be proportionate to
             the lawful aim pursued; namely the maintenance of a  fair  and
             effective immigration control so as to safeguard the  economic
             wellbeing of the United Kingdom."

    The judge therefore dismissed the appeal.

9.   The grounds of appeal argue that the case should have  been  considered
    outside the Rules as although it was accepted that paragraph 297 of the
    Rules and the Immigration Directorate Instructions set out  that  where
    the sponsor mother  was  not  yet  settled  with  permanent  status  in
    Britain, this was a case which cried out for consideration outside  the
    Immigration Rules and for the exercise of discretion.   It  was  argued
    further  that  the  judge  had  found  that  the   sponsor   had   sole
    responsibility for the children and the grounds therefore  appeared  to
    argue that the judge had not taken  into  account  the  fact  that  the
    sponsor's family friend [G] had stated that she was  unable  to  assist
    further as she  needed  to  devote  more  time  to  her  own  children.
    Emphasis was placed on the ages of the children and it appears that  it
    was argued that there were compelling and compassionate  reasons  which
    would mean that the children should be granted entry clearance although
    the phrase from Macdonald's Immigration Law & Practice which was quoted
    in the grounds refers to the refugee family reunion policy (page 24  of
    the bundle).  It was argued  that  there  were  the  compelling  family
    circumstances required by the Rules and reference was made  to  Section
    55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.  It was argued
    that the judge had erred in her approach to  the  issue  of  Article  8
    outside the Rules and had not, as  required,  taken  into  account  the
    impact on the whole family unit.

10.  Mr Bahja referred to the findings of the judge  that  the  sponsor  had
    sole responsibility for all the children and that family  life  existed
    and stated that the judge had erred in dismissing the appeal on Article
    8 grounds.  He referred  to  the  reasoning  of  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    McWilliam who had granted permission to appeal.  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    McWilliam had stated:-

         "The children were healthy.  They had not lived  with  the  sponsor
         since 2006 when she came here to the  UK.   The  third  appellant's
         father was alive, and the judge did not accept that the  first  and
         second appellant's father was deceased.  However,  it  is  arguable
         that in the  light  of  the  finding  that  the  sponsor  had  sole
         responsibility for the children this was  a  factor  that  was  not
         properly put into the proportionality assessment.  It  is  arguable
         that there was evidence that [G] was no longer able to  look  after
         the children which the judge did not arguably engage with".

11.  Mr Bahja argued that  the  judge  had  not  properly  placed  into  the
    balancing exercise the finding that the sponsor had sole responsibility
    and stated that the judge had erred when stating that modern  means  of
    communication would mean that  family  life  could  be  continued.   He
    referred to the judgment in AP (India) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 89  where
    it stated that young students usually continue  to  form  an  important
    part of the family in which they have grown up  and  so  gravitated  to
    their homes during the holidays, and upon graduation, while  they  seek
    to  "make  their  own  way".   There  should   therefore   be   careful
    consideration where that type of issue existed.

12.  That judgment had also gone on to state:-

         "The idea that this family's family life  (as  it  existed  before)
         should be maintained by telephone, other forms of communication and
         occasional visits, as the FTT considered possible in  paragraph  31
         of its judgment, is to my mind wholly unrealistic (McCombe LJ)".

13.  The grounds also referred to the letter from the sponsor's  friend  [G]
    in the bundle.

14.  In reply Mr Duffy pointed out it was accepted that the Rules  were  not
    met and that therefore the relevant test would be that  of  exceptional
    circumstances, these being defined in GEN IDI 3.2(2) in Appendix FM  of
    the Rules which  referred  to  "justifiably  harsh  consequences".   He
    pointed out the children could live  with  [G]  although  two  were  in
    boarding school, and that the younger was only aged 2.  He stated there
    was nothing to show there  were  justifiably  harsh  consequences.   He
    referred to the decision in the judgment of McCombe LJ in AP but stated
    that that related to entirely different circumstances as not only  were
    the children in that case older and the  family  had  all  been  living
    together in India and it was  not  a  case  of  a  mother  leaving  her
    children to come to Britain and thereafter  overstaying  and  therefore
    not  seeing  them  for  many  years.   He  referred  to  the  sponsor's
    immigration history and pointed out that she could have returned to  be
    with the children at any time but had not done so.

15.  He said that the judge had  been  slightly  unclear  with  the  finding
    regarding family life as she did refer in paragraph 31 to the fact that
    she did not accept that interference with family life was caused by the
    refusal of entry clearance. He pointed out that [G] had not  said  that
    she would abandon the children.  It was therefore not a material  error
    of the judge not to have dealt with that.  He said that  in  any  event
    there was the prospect  of  a  further  application  being  made.   The
    children, in any event would not be entitled  to  anything  other  than
    limited leave as the sponsor only had limited leave.

16.  In reply, Mr Bahja emphasised the decision in  AP  (India),  emphasised
    the importance of a balancing exercise rather than  the  issue  of  the
    interruption or threat to family life.

Discussion

17.  I consider that the judge did properly consider  all  relevant  factors
    in this case.  It is of note and she was entitled to  place  weight  on
    the fact that the sponsor, having come to Britain, overstayed and  that
    that meant that she had been unable  to  make  regular  visits  to  the
    children.  There is reference to the sponsor having visited Tanzania in
    2010 and 2014, however it does appear that she was doing that at a time
    when she did not have leave to remain in Britain, but in any event  she
    was not in a position to make applications for the appellants  to  come
    here.  The maintenance requirements of the Rules were not met and there
    seems to be no attempt to indicate to the judge that they could be met.
      Moreover,  there  was  nothing  to  indicate  whether  or   not   the
    accommodation requirements of the Rules could be met for three  further
    children.  Although reference was  made  to  the  judgment  in  AP  the
    reality is that that case referred to a  completely  different  set  of
    circumstances where the family had lived together in India and had then
    been divided.  Those left in India would clearly have had  a  different
    quality of family life when they  were  with  their  parents  from  the
    family life which these appellants have in this case where the  sponsor
    had decided to leave  Tanzania  leaving  her  children  there.   It  is
    important to take into account the best interests of the  children  but
    it is not clear that those would necessarily be served by them  joining
    their mother and stepfather here given that they have lived  all  their
    life in Tanzania and been educated there. The fact that the judge found
    that the sponsor has sole responsibility for  the  children  is  not  a
    determinative factor in an Article 8 assessment outside the  rules.   I
    would add that the third appellant does not appear to qualify under the
    Rules for leave to enter - he is not the  child  of  the  sponsor,  his
    father is alive and indeed is still in contact.

18.  In all, I consider that the judge did properly weigh  up  all  relevant
    factors and reached conclusions which were fully open to  her  thereon.
    I therefore dismiss these appeals.

19.   I would add that a bundle of documents has now  been  submitted  which
    indicate that the sponsor's husband (incorrectly  referred  to  in  the
    skeleton argument as the children's father when he is their stepfather)
    is now earning well over the necessary amount to entitle  the  children
    to come here  although  there  does  not  appear  to  be  any  evidence
    regarding the accommodation available.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  appellants  are
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify them or any member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellants and to the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

Decision

This appeal is dismissed. The decision of the Judge in the First-tier  shall
stand.
