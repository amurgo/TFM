                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Mr I Graham for the Secretary of State
Mr B Caswell (counsel instructed by  Brar & Co, Newcastle) for the  claimant


  This is an appeal from a decision of  an  adjudicator  (Mr  K  Gillance),
  sitting at Leeds on 14 March 2001, allowing an asylum  and  human  rights
  appeal by a Roman Catholic Albanian  citizen  of  Montenegro.  Leave  was
  given on the  basis  of  grounds  citing  the  adjudicator's  failure  to
  consider internal flight.

2. That had not been raised in terms by the presenting  officer  before  the
  adjudicator; but, as Mr Caswell had to  concede,  the  question  is  very
  obviously raised by the adjudicator's findings at � 30, on the  basis  of
  the CIPU report before him and  the  evidence  he  had  heard  about  the
  individual case:

  ... ethnic Albanians from Montenegro are not generally harassed and  have
  their own political party and will find it difficult  to  substantiate  a
  claim to asylum on general ethnic grounds. I accept that that may well be
  the case generally. However in this particular case I find that there was
  a vulnerable area around Podgorica and the  military  bases  there  where
  ethnic Albanians were seriously harassed and terrified by Serbian troops.

3. Clearly the adjudicator should have considered whether or  not  it  would
  be unduly harsh to expect the claimant to seek  refuge  with  his  family
  somewhere away from the "vulnerable area around Podgorica" where they had
  been living. We invited Mr Caswell to address us  on  that.  To  set  the
  scene, the adjudicator had found, and there is no challenge to this, that
  between 1999 and 2000 the claimant had suffered from  the  presence  near
  his village of Serb troops of the  Army  of  Yugoslavia  [VJ],  the  most
  serious incident being when they tried to kidnap his wife.  In  addition,
  he had faced problems with the local Montenegrin police, when he  refused
  to help them by storing arms for them to use against the VJ  in  case  of
  need. At that time they had had one child,  Valmira,  born  26  September
  1999. All three of  them  came  here  in  October  2000:  another  child,
  Kristjan, was born here on  18  December  2001.  Montenegro  is  a  small
  country, but by no means a micro-state. The CIPU report gives its area as
  nearly 14,000 km�, and its population as about 700,000: there was  a  map
  before the adjudicator which shows Podgorica, the  capital,  towards  its
  south-east corner. The claimant's village of Shipshanik is 15-20 km south-
  east of Podgorica, as the adjudicator notes at � 10.

4. Mr Caswell began by referring us to  evidence  in  the  current  (October
  2002) CIPU report about the economic situation in Montenegro. While  that
  refers to 40% unemployment,  and  an  average  wage  for  those  in  work
  considered insufficient for a family,  leading  to  half  the  population
  being below the "poverty line" (however that may be  defined),  there  is
  nothing to suggest that represents anything other than problems faced  by
  the claimant's fellow-citizens in general. Mr Caswell suggested that  the
  claimant was liable to face discrimination as an  Albanian;  and,  within
  that community as a Roman Catholic; but he was not able to  refer  us  to
  any background evidence to suggest that  persons  of  either  description
  were seriously  disadvantaged  in  seeking  employment.  The  adjudicator
  explicitly found against the claimant (at �  22)  on  any  suggestion  of
  religious persecution. Though the CIPU report at � 6.9 shows the Orthodox
  Church (in different guises) is the only one recognized by law, there  is
  no suggestion there or anywhere else we have been  referred  to  of  even
  discrimination against Roman Catholics.

5. Mr Caswell went on to point out that the claimant and his family have  no
  friends or relations elsewhere in Montenegro; but he had to concede  that
  they were in the same position when they arrived in this country. Clearly
  their history shows they are enterprising and self-reliant enough to make
  out by themselves in a new home, unless the conditions themselves can  be
  described as unduly harsh. A further point, about whether they  would  be
  accepted back by the  Montenegrin  authorities  (though  one  might  well
  expect they would, having lived there all their lives till now) does  not
  arise, because Mr Graham was able to assure us that no-one is returned to
  Montenegro, unless the authorities there have confirmed they will  accept
  them as returning citizens.

6. Mr Caswell referred us  to  evidence  criticizing  the  criminal  justice
  process in Montenegro; but, with the exception of one piece of  evidence,
  there is nothing to suggest that this claimant would be brought into  any
  contact with that on return. That evidence comes in a  further  statement
  from the claimant, taken from him at Mr Caswell's  suggestion  after  the
  present hearing was  listed  on  13  November  2002,  and  signed  on  16
  December, with copies sent to the Tribunal on the 20th. There is  nothing
  in the covering letter, or anywhere else Mr Caswell could refer us to, to
  show that a copy had also been sent to the Home Office; and Mr Graham did
  not have one. We agreed to consider the points raised in  the  statement,
  so we could see whether they called for a reply from the Home  Office  on
  notice; but solicitors should be well aware that, particularly where they
  file evidence fairly late in the day, they must be in a position also  to
  show it has been served on the other side.

7. The point on which Mr Caswell relied  on  the  claimant's  statement  was
  that he had been in touch with his father,  still  apparently  living  in
  their home village, and been told that the  chief  of  police  was  still
  looking for him, and would arrest him if he returned. The  claimant  also
  said he was afraid that officer "... could use his power to locate me  in
  other parts of Montenegro, so that we would have to go into  hiding."  Mr
  Caswell, without citing any reason why, asked us to accept that statement
  "at face value".

8. While we of course accept that the statement was obtained as a result  of
  Mr Caswell's (very sensible) advice on evidence, we are at a loss to  see
  any other reason why the chief's continuing  interest  in  this  claimant
  should come to light over two years after he left the area, and just when
  his case was up for its final hearing. The problem between  the  claimant
  and the police had been a local one, arising out of a situation now  well
  in the past (the  potential  conflict  between  them  and  the  VJ  units
  stationed nearby). We see no reason why it should still represent a  real
  risk, even in the claimant's home area; and no basis at all for its doing
  so elsewhere in Montenegro. The CIPU report says  at  �  5.10  that  "...
  there have been few publicised incidents of abuse": those set  out  at  �
  5.14 all date back to 2001.

9. Taking all the points made by Mr Caswell together, in the  light  of  the
  views we have expressed on each, we do not think it can possibly be  said
  that it would be unduly harsh, in terms of Robinson [1997] Imm AR 568 and
  the examples given there, for this claimant to be expected to  return  to
  some part of Montenegro other than his home village.
