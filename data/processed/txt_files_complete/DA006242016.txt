For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr B Malik, Counsel instructed by Calices Solicitors



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This appeal comes back before me following a hearing on 24  April  2017
    whereby I decided that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  ("FtT")
    should be set aside for error of law.  I also decided that the decision
    should be re-made in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appeal was listed  before  me  on  7  July  2017  but  because  the
    appellant's solicitors had not complied with my earlier directions, the
    appeal had to be adjourned.  In correspondence, it  was  apparent  that
    the appellant's solicitors failed to understand what  was  said  in  my
    further directions about Counsel at the hearing  on  7  July  2017  not
    having been properly briefed.  It is however clear from [24]  and  [33]
    of the error of law decision entitled "Decision and Directions"  why  I
    came to that conclusion.

 3. I have included the Error of Law Decision as an Annex to  this  present
    decision.  However, it is useful to provide a summary of the background
    to the appeal.

 4. The appellant is a citizen of France, born in  1995.   A  decision  was
    made on 12 November 2015  to  make  a  deportation  order  against  him
    pursuant to the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2006
    ("the 2006  Regulations")  because  of  his  convictions  for  criminal
    offences.

 5. On 9 September 2014 he was convicted of offences of having an offensive
    weapon and affray, for which he received a sentence  of  eight  months'
    detention in a young offenders' institution.  On 23 April 2015  he  was
    sentenced to 16 weeks in a young offenders' institution  for  burglary,
    possession of a controlled drug, assault on a  constable  and  criminal
    damage.  His most recent conviction was on 15 October 2015 in the Crown
    Court at Basildon for offences of robbery  and  damaging  property  for
    which he received a  sentence  of  30  months'  detention  in  a  young
    offenders' institution.

 6. As indicated in the error of law decision, some findings of  fact  made
    by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  ("FtJ")  can  be  preserved.   Those
    preserved findings were the subject  of  agreement  before  me  at  the
    resumed hearing.  They are as follows:

       . The appellant has been in the UK since 1997.  By the  time  of  his
         first custodial sentence in September 2014 he had lived in  the  UK
         for about 17 years.

       . The appellant had grown up in the UK and was (at the  date  of  the
         hearing before the FtJ) aged 21.  He came to the UK  as  a  toddler
         and has known no other life.  Although his  late  teens  have  been
         characterised by criminality, the appellant has no real  connection
         with France beyond the fact of his  nationality  and  that  of  his
         immediate family.  He has no ties to France and his life has always
         been in the UK for as long as he can remember.

       . The appellant has a poor record of criminality over the  last  four
         years (at the time of the  hearing  before  the  FtJ).   He  was  a
         relatively persistent offender across the  criminal  spectrum  with
         offences of dishonesty and possession of street drugs  and  serious
         offences  against  the  person  involving  robbery,  assault  on  a
         constable, affray and  possession  of  an  offensive  weapon.   His
         offending appears to have escalated since he left home at  the  age
         of 16 and  only  to  have  been  controlled  when  sentenced  to  a
         relatively lengthy period of imprisonment of 30 months.

 7. For the avoidance of doubt, those  preserved  findings  come  from  the
    decision of the FtJ and are, more or less,  set  out  at  [13]  of  the
    skeleton argument on behalf of the appellant prepared for  the  hearing
    on 7 July 2017  which,  as  already  indicated,  was  adjourned.   That
    paragraph of the skeleton argument suggests  other  preserved  findings
    but as indicated to the  parties  at  the  resumed  hearing,  the  only
    preserved findings are those which I have set out.  Thus, for  example,
    the FtJ's conclusion that the appellant had demonstrated  a  change  in
    his behaviour, or that he did not pose "a serious and present risk"  to
    security or public policy, could not be preserved findings in the light
    of my conclusions as to the FtJ's error(s) of law.

 8. At this, the resumed hearing, further documents were provided on behalf
    of the appellant in the form  of  supplementary  bundles  of  documents
    consisting of 40 and 65 pages, respectively.  I also had  before  me  a
    skeleton argument on behalf of the appellant dated 20  September  2017.
    The respondent provided an OASys report with a date of 12 July 2017 but
    that date does not reveal much in terms  of  the  date  of  the  actual
    assessments in it, as distinct from it being a date when the report was
    accessed.

 9. I heard oral evidence from the appellant and his father, Mr Ikwili Mbu,
    which I summarise below.

    The oral evidence

10. The appellant adopted his witness statement dated 5 July 2017.  He  was
    asked in examination-in-chief about incidents  recorded  in  the  OASys
    report in relation to his having been placed on  report  for  allegedly
    assaulting another prisoner (page 9). The appellant said that  life  in
    prison was tough and you have  to  defend  yourself,  otherwise  people
    would attack you.  People had tried bullying him and he was not  happy.
    The authorities did not address those incidents.  No-one ever spoke  to
    him about that.  If you are in a fight and officers know about  it  you
    would be put on the 'basic' regime with no association and no TV.

11. It was when he left prison that his problems with those people came  to
    an end.  He tried to talk to people about it.  The incidents  ended  in
    December 2015 and into 2016.

12. In cross-examination he said that he was  aware  of  the  OASys  report
    because the probation officer had told him about it.  However,  he  was
    not aware of its content.  As to why his witness statement at  [6]  did
    not deal with those incidents involving fights in prison, the appellant
    said that the deportation scenario and prison scenario  are  different.
    By the time he got into the immigration system he left all that  behind
    him; fighting and so on.  When he was at HMP Verne he was not  involved
    in any fights.  He tried to be a model prisoner.  He had said,  as  per
    the OASys report, that he had been part of the YBC gang, but  that  was
    when he was 15 or 16 years old.  As to what is recorded  in  the  OASys
    report on page 8 about his having stolen knives and meat cleavers which
    he had been going to sell for �5 each, the appellant said that that was
    100% correct.  It was also correct that the 2014 offences of having  an
    offensive weapon and affray were gang related.

13. In relation to the PNC report showing a racially aggravated offence, he
    agreed that he had said words he was not supposed to say  to  an  Asian
    police officer.

14. As to when he ended his association with the YBC gang, he got  arrested
    in 2013 and dealt with in 2014.  By that time he had moved to Essex but
    he was still involved with crime, but not gang crime.   His  ties  with
    the YBC had ended by that time.

15. In relation to the 2015 offences  of  burglary,  theft,  possession  of
    controlled drugs, assault on police, robbery and  being  carried  in  a
    motor vehicle taken without consent, he was not associated with the YBC
    gang at that time.  He was not connected to a gang but  only  connected
    to "low lifes" who were not doing anything with their lives, and so  he
    kept getting into trouble.  The YBC gang were  just  a  bunch  of  kids
    being stupid.  By 2016 he was already in Essex.  The YBC gang  were  in
    the Stratford area, which is where he is living now (at the date of the
    hearing).  That gang still exists in Stratford.

16. His father speaks French at home, and he,  the  appellant,  understands
    French.

17. As to what is said at page 13 of the  OASys  report  about  his  having
    refused to engage with the leaving care team, the appellant  said  that
    the only leaving care team that he was aware of were the social workers
    and they only help with housing.

18. It was true, as stated in the decision letter, that  he  had  signed  a
    disclaimer stating that he wished to return to France.  However, he was
    feeling stressed after having finished a two-year  sentence,  and  then
    realised that if he had to go to France he would have nowhere to go to.



19. It was true that before he did use to act impulsively, but  as  he  has
    grown up he had seen the light.  The time he had spent in prison helped
    him to be more patient and understanding.  The first time he  had  been
    in jail from the conviction in September 2014  was  for  eight  months.
    That did not change his attitude because it was his first time in  jail
    and he does not think that it was long enough.  He also did not have  a
    deportation order against him.  He was thinking about how  his  actions
    affected people.

20. As to the proposition  that  there  was  a  strong  risk  of  impulsive
    behaviour if he were to win his deportation appeal  and  there  was  no
    deportation order for him to consider, the appellant said that that was
    a good question to ask.  Since he has been out of prison  he  has  been
    trying to better himself.  He has become involved in the community  and
    is volunteering in youth work.

21. As to the OASys report stating that he is a high risk to the public  in
    the community and a medium risk to known adults, that  was  just  their
    opinion and it would be up to the judge to decide.

22. He lives with his parents.  Apart  from  voluntary  work,  he  and  his
    brother are doing martial arts.  He does not want to waste his time.

23. In re-examination he  explained  the  offence  of  racially  aggravated
    harassment, which  involved  failing  to  pay  for  a  fare  on  public
    transport.  The staff tried to stop him.  He had cannabis on him so  he
    ran.  He had pleaded guilty because he was at fault.  He explained what
    words he had used.  He is not proud of that and he is embarrassed about
    it.

24. YBC stands for Young Blood City.  He could not even say what  the  gang
    is all about.  He was a kid.  You have to be pretty stupid to be in it.
     It had crippled his lifestyle and in relation to his family.  He  kept
    getting arrested.   He  missed  college  and  university.   He  has  no
    friends.  That is the sad thing about it.  The only friends he has  are
    his family.

25. He is not able to find paid employment at the moment  because  of  "all
    this".

26. He understands French.  When his mother tells him to  do  something  in
    French he understands.  They do not have  a  full  conversation.   They
    speak English.  He gave examples of simple words  he  understands.   He
    said that he understands the basics in French  but  is  not  fluent  in
    conversation.

27. His time in adult prison was hard.   That  was  when  he  got  to  find
    himself and the values of life and how precious it is.

28. In his late 20's he would want to be the CEO of a big  charity  whereby
    he could be helping people.  He wants to be  the  founder  of  a  music
    charity for people who have no funds but have talent.  Otherwise, those
    people would end up like him, fighting deportation, and that is not the
    best place to be.

29.  Mr  Ikwili  Mbu,  the  appellant's  father,  gave  evidence  with  the
    assistance of a French interpreter.  He adopted his witness  statement.
    As to  what  he  is  able  to  do  about  the  risk  of  the  appellant
    reoffending, he said that the appellant had been  influenced  by  other
    people and he has now become aware.  One day he was in his  bedroom  in
    the house and the appellant was downstairs.   He  saw  children  making
    signs towards the appellant.  He then saw him and he was  crying.   The
    appellant told him that he had realised what he had done and  regretted
    that he had taken the wrong path.  He regretted all his  past  actions.
    That was about a month after he left prison.

30. He was referred to P60 documents from page 42  of  the  65-page  bundle
    which he said were in relation to  his  work  at  Harmony  House.   The
    originals are at home because no-one asked him to bring them.

31. In cross-examination he said that that employment was his only form  of
    income.

32. He was asked about his wife's employment and said  that  she  had  just
    started working.  When asked what she earns he said that she worked  at
    B&Q, then stopped working there and studied.  She then started  working
    for Eurostar.  As to how much she earns, he  said  that  sometimes  she
    works and sometimes not.  She earns between �1,500 - �1,800 per  month.
    His youngest son sometimes works at weekends.

33. They live in a council flat.  As to how much  the  rent  is,  his  wife
    takes care of that type of thing, but it is about �600 (per month).

34. He was born in the DRC in Kinshasa and was brought up speaking  French.
    He became a French citizen in 1999.  He did not learn  English  in  the
    DRC or in France.  When he came to the UK he did not speak English.

35. When the appellant was growing up he would speak to him in French.   As
    to whether  he  would  talk  to  him  in  French  about,  for  example,
    schoolwork and his  daily  life,  it  was  different  because  he,  the
    witness, grew up within the Belgian system.  Otherwise, he would  speak
    to the appellant in French.   At  home  they  speak  in  French  often.
    However, it is easy for his wife to speak English so she speaks English
    to the children and he speaks French.

36. When he was in prison in 2015 he often went to visit him.  They used to
    have a conversation and he would ask him if  he  was  alright.   As  to
    whether he was aware of any problems that the appellant was  having  in
    prison, he is a resilient child.  He had told him that he tried  to  be
    better, to work and to try and help people in the gym.

37. As to whether he was aware of his son having fights in prison in  2015,
    he did not really talk about that.  When he  went  to  prison  he,  the
    witness, had some health  issues.   He  had  to  go  to  the  emergency
    department as he had a kind of crisis on two occasions.   His  son  did
    not want to make his health any worse so did  not  talk  to  him  about
    those things.  He takes medication because he has a heart condition and
    diabetes.

38. He was aware of the appellant's offending from 2012 because  they  came
    to arrest him.  As to incidents in prison, he was not aware of them.

39. As to whether the appellant was and is still impulsive and could not be
    controlled, he did not think he would reoffend.  It is true that he had
    made mistakes in his young years.  Today he could  see  that  he  is  a
    transformed person.

40. In relation to the incident where he saw  some  children  calling  him,
    those children had nothing to do with gangs.  They were  children  from
    the neighbourhood.  He did not know any members of the gang.   He  knew
    that  those  children  involved  in  that  incident   were   from   the
    neighbourhood as he had seen them growing up.

41. As to whether he and the family could provide financial support to  the
    appellant if he was deported to France, that would be difficult because
    the only relative there is his mother-in-law but she is very sick.   He
    does not know how to write French.  It would be very difficult for him.
     He studied here and now he could find a job and  make  a  living.   It
    would not be possible to provide financial support.  He would  have  to
    pay the appellant's rent and provide groceries for him.

42. His mother-in-law has a partner or sort of  companion  who  lives  with
    her.  He does not believe that he would accept the  appellant  to  come
    and stay with them.  He had not asked them but the lifestyle they  have
    means he does not believe that they would accept him.

43. In answer to my questions he said that  he  visited  the  appellant  in
    detention on his own and  then  with  his  younger  son  and  then  his
    daughter.  When speaking to him he spoke in French.

44. In further re-examination he said that he does speak a  little  English
    and speaks it at work.  However, his co-workers know that he  struggled
    to adapt to  the  language.   When  he  speaks  to  the  appellant  the
    appellant replies in French or English.  He would say that  his  French
    is about 35 or 40%.  His French is average or below and he could detect
    some mistakes in his speaking and he corrects him.

45. When he came to the UK at about 18 months old he learnt French at home.
     He would assess someone who was born and grew up and studied in France
    as having 100% French language.  The appellant mixes French and English
    when he communicates with him.

    Submissions

46. Mr Jarvis submitted that the appellant does still constitute a risk  of
    reoffending.   Although  the  OASys  report  is  not  the  clearest  of
    documents in terms of when the views expressed in it were obtained,  it
    does appear to post-date April 2016.  It indicates that  the  appellant
    is a high risk to the public and the community and  a  medium  risk  to
    known  adults.   Nothing  provided  by  the  appellant  displaces  that
    expression of opinion.

47. Mr Jarvis referred to the appellant's history  of  offending,  and  the
    most recent offence resulting in a sentence of 30 months' imprisonment.
     That, it was submitted, was significant evidence  that  the  appellant
    had  not  changed  his  ways.   The  range  of  offences  adds  to  the
    respondent's view that the appellant acts on impulse and  has  no  real
    regard for the general public or the consequences of his  actions.   As
    in the case of Jarusevicius (EEA  Reg  21  -  effect  of  imprisonment)
    [2012] UKUT 00120 (IAC) at [63(iv)] there was no positive  evidence  of
    insight into the appellant's offending.  In his  witness  statement  he
    had only referred to positive evidence from a person within the  prison
    system.  However, that post-dates the period when he  was  involved  in
    fights and acts of aggression.  Now he is back in his home area.

48. It is not suggested that the appellant or  his  father's  evidence  was
    irrelevant, but of course the appellant wanted to avoid deportation and
    there is a significant chance of his  manipulating  the  evidence.   An
    example of this is his evidence about his ability to understand French.
     From his father's evidence it was plain that the  appellant  does  not
    simply have a rudimentary or basic understanding of French  as  he  had
    suggested.  He had been brought up in a  bilingual  household  and  his
    father speaks to him all the time in French.

49. Even if he was not fluent in French, he was  seeking  to  maximise  the
    issue of language in terms of his ability to reintegrate on  return  to
    France.

50. It is not disputed that he may have been involved in  charity  work  or
    that he has an interest in a music charity.  However,  the  appellant's
    conduct showed that he was  initially  involved  in  a  gang  and  then
    involved in escalating offending by deliberately associating  with  the
    wrong people.

51. His father and his family had not been able to control or influence his
    behaviour.  His father did not even know about the incidents in prison.
     That does not mean that his father is not sincere about his view about
    the appellant's change in behaviour but the evidence tends to point  in
    a different direction.

52.  As  to  the  level  of  protection  from  deportation  under  the  EEA
    Regulations that the appellant is entitled to, there was no  particular
    evidence to suggest that the P60's are forged.   It  may  be  that  one
    could conclude that there was enough to accept that evidence.  However,
    the appellant and his family have had  a  number  of  opportunities  to
    provide evidence of the appellant's compliance with  EU  law.   If  the
    P60's are  reliable,  they  suggest  that  there  is  evidence  of  the
    appellant's father working in the UK since 2002.

53. It is 'possible' to rely  in  principle  on  the  appellant's  ten-year
    period of residence before his first custodial sentence,  and  even  if
    there were gaps  in  that  continuous  residence  by  reason  of  other
    custodial sentences.  That follows  from  the  decision  in  Warsame  v
    Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  16.
    However, the appellant's criminal conduct shows no desire on  his  part
    to integrate.  Prior to  his  first  custodial  sentence  in  2014  the
    appellant was involved in criminality since at least 2012.

54. This was not a case in which the appellant was entitled  to  protection
    from deportation on 'imperative' grounds.  If it is accepted  that  his
    father was in employment,  it  would  be  a  case  of  protection  from
    deportation on the lesser level of 'serious' grounds.  It was  conceded
    on his behalf that he would not be entitled to  a  permanent  right  of
    residence on the basis of having been a student.

55. It was proportionate to remove him despite his longstanding connections
    with the UK.  His family, in particular his father,  has  a  connection
    with France.  There has been no enquiry  of  these  family  members  in
    France in terms of their ability to assist the appellant were he to  be
    returned there.

56. If the question of proportionality arose, it would  have  been  decided
    that the appellant does represent a risk.  Any rehabilitation in the UK
    has not been effective  and  does  not  outweigh  the  public  interest
    because of the  nature  of  the  risk.   Relying  on  the  decision  in
    Secretary of State for the Home Department v  Dumliauskas  [2015]  EWCA
    Civ 145 at [54], Mr Jarvis submitted  that  the  greater  the  risk  of
    reoffending the greater was the right to deport an individual.

57. The appellant was not so  disconnected  culturally  and  linguistically
    from France as to suggest that his removal there would amount to exile.
     He would be able to adapt and his father's evidence was  that  he  was
    resilient.

58. In his submissions Mr Malik contended that the appellant  does  have  a
    permanent right of residence in the light of his father's oral evidence
    and the documentary evidence of his employment.  Throughout that  time,
    when  his  father  was  a  qualified  person,  the  appellant  was  his
    dependant.  Although the originals of the P60's had not been brought to
    court, the appellant's father was not  cross-examined  in  relation  to
    those documents.

59.  It  was  accepted  that  prima  facie  the  authorities  suggest  that
    imprisonment breaks the  continuity  of  residence.   However,  it  was
    contended that the consequence of that would  be  that  any  period  of
    imprisonment before the expiry of the ten-year period would  break  the
    continuity of residence.

60. Mr Malik submitted, and Mr Jarvis agreed, that if a  continuous  period
    of residence of ten years is made out, then  imperative  grounds  could
    not, on the basis of this appellant's offending, be said to apply.

61. In terms of whether the appellant represents  a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat, previous convictions are not of themselves
    sufficient.  Any assessment in relation to a young person that  is  not
    current, is of very limited value.  It was  contended  that  the  OASys
    report is almost worthless because there was no evidence as to the date
    of the entries in it and it appears  to  be  an  out-of-date  document.
    Although it was submitted on behalf of the respondent  that  the  OASys
    report was an expert assessment, that contention goes too far,  it  was
    submitted.  There is no detail of the qualifications of the person  who
    prepared the report or the basis upon which the entries  in  the  OASys
    report were made.

62. I was further invited to take into account the appellant's age, and the
    proposition that young people make bad choices.  As they get older they
    make  better  choices.   Gangs  usually  feature  young  people.    The
    appellant's evidence was that he had grown out of  that  culture.   The
    appellant had not sought to conceal his offending.

63.  Even  if  the  appellant  does  represent  a  genuine,   present   and
    sufficiently serious threat, in terms  of  proportionality  he  has  no
    connections to France.  He has only ever known his close family in  the
    UK.  He only has a  grandmother  in  France.   That  evidence  was  not
    challenged.  His only connection with France is  through  the  language
    and that is not in any event a strong connection in his case.  That  is
    the only matter that the Secretary of State is able to rely on.

64. It was true that on the face of  it  the  appellant  and  his  father's
    evidence in relation to the appellant's French language ability was not
    the same.  But even his father's evidence  did  not  suggest  that  the
    appellant could meaningly communicate in French.

65. Although it was contended on behalf of the respondent that there was an
    absence of evidence in terms  of  the  appellant's  family's  finances,
    documentary evidence had been provided in the form of the P60's.  I was
    reminded  of  the  appellant's  father's  evidence  in  terms  of   the
    likelihood that he would have to pay rent for the appellant in  France,
    and for his food and other expenses.

66. In terms of rehabilitation, the appellant was  only  released  in  June
    2017.  He could rehabilitate.  The respondent had suggested that  there
    was no prospect of  rehabilitation  but  that  suggestion  was  "unduly
    harsh".  Rehabilitation in France  would  be  impeded  because  of  the
    practical difficulties.

    Analysis and Conclusions

67. It is clear from authority  that  a  period  of  imprisonment  (or  its
    equivalent) 'in principle' breaks  the  continuity  of  residence  when
    calculating the ten-year period necessary for protection  from  removal
    on imperative grounds (see Secretary of State for the Home Department v
    MG [2014] EUECJ C-400/12, and Warsame).

68. The ten-year period is to be calculated by counting back from the  date
    of the deportation/expulsion decision, not in fact from the date of the
    sentence of imprisonment, which in  some  cases  may  make  a  material
    difference.

69. The  FtJ  in  this  case  concluded  that  the  appellant's  period  of
    continuous residence had been  broken  by  the  terms  of  imprisonment
    beginning with the eight months imposed in September 2014 in the  Crown
    Court at Snaresbrook for which he received a sentence of eight  months'
    detention in a young offenders' institution  for  having  an  offensive
    weapon,  and  on  the  same  occasion  being  sentenced  to  18  weeks'
    imprisonment to run concurrently for an offensive of affray.   However,
    as I indicated in the error of law decision, the  FtJ's  assessment  in
    that regard did not reflect the more nuanced approach reflected in  the
    decisions in MG and Warsame.  Revisiting the issue, I am satisfied that
    the  custodial  sentence  imposed  in  September  2014  did  break  the
    continuity of the appellant's  continuous  residence.   It  reflects  a
    break in his integrating links with  the  UK  when  considered  in  the
    context of the fact that the offences were committed in  February  2013
    and that a year earlier,  in  March  2012,  he  had  already  committed
    offences of theft, having an offensive weapon (a knife), possession  of
    controlled drugs (being  an  offence  committed  whilst  on  bail)  and
    handling stolen goods.

70. Furthermore, the appellant accepted that he had been involved  in  gang
    crime, which he accepted in evidence was at the time of the offences in
    2012.  That is reflected in the OASys report. It is also clear from the
    OASys report at page 9 that whilst detained in 2015 the  appellant  was
    involved in numerous incidents of fights with other prisoners, with the
    report  also  stating  that  there  were  numerous  incidents  of  poor
    compliance with the prison regime.  He is said in the  report  to  have
    posed a risk to other prisoners.

71. In all those circumstances, I am satisfied  that  whatever  integrating
    links the appellant had established in the UK in  his  pre-imprisonment
    years, those integrating links had been broken by his imprisonment.

72. As  to  whether  the  appellant  has  acquired  a  permanent  right  of
    residence, different considerations apply.  It was implicitly  accepted
    that if the appellant was for a period of five years a dependant  of  a
    person exercising Treaty rights, then he will have acquired a permanent
    right of residence.  The appellant arrived in  the  UK  in  1997.   His
    period as a student, for the reasons explained  in  the  error  of  law
    decision, and there being no further evidence on the issue,  cannot  be
    counted as a period during which he could be said in his own  right  to
    have been exercising Treaty rights.  However, there are  P60's  in  the
    name of the appellant's father relating to his employment going back to
    2001, and up to 2017.  The evidence from the appellant before  the  FtJ
    was that he left home at the age of 16.  Even if it could reasonably be
    said that on leaving home he ceased to be dependent on his  father,  by
    that time, assuming that the appellant's  father  had  been  exercising
    Treaty rights since 2001, the appellant will have acquired a  permanent
    right of residence.

73. I have already referred to the fact that the  originals  of  the  P60's
    were not provided.  I also indicated at the hearing that in the absence
    of anything on the face of the copies that  revealed  some  anomaly  or
    irregularity (in which event I said would invite further submissions) I
    would not reject the reliability of the P60's simply on the basis  that
    they were only copies.  Mr Jarvis  did  not  make  any  submissions  in
    relation to the P60's in terms of their content or the detail in  them,
    and it was not suggested to the appellant's  father  that  he  had  not
    given a truthful account of his employment.

74. In those circumstances, I am satisfied that the appellant's father  has
    been employed since 2001 until the present day and that the  P60's  are
    reliable evidence of that employment.  Thus, the appellant has acquired
    a permanent right of residence.

75. It follows therefore, that in this case that means that he may only  be
    removed on serious grounds of public policy.

76. A crucial assessment to be made is whether the appellant  represents  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society.  In  making  an  assessment  of  that
    issue, I have taken into account all the evidence,  including  that  in
    the OASys report.  In  that  analysis,  I  do  not  consider  that  any
    conclusions in either direction can be drawn from the incident referred
    to by the appellant's father when some apparently  local  children  are
    said to have been beckoning to or waving at  the  appellant  after  his
    last release from custody,  at  least  not  in  terms  of  whether  the
    appellant was apparently continuing to  associate  with  gang  members.
    Whilst the appellant's father did his best to  describe  the  incident,
    the evidence was not clear in demonstrating  that  those  young  people
    were gang members, or that they were calling the  appellant  to  become
    involved in some activity related to gang  membership  or  criminality.
    By the same token, I do not find that the appellant's  father  actually
    knew, or was able to know, whether they were or were not gang  members.
    Thus, neither can it be said  that  the  appellant  was  continuing  to
    associate with gang members on that occasion, nor could it be said that
    he was refusing to engage with gang members.

77. What I do take from that evidence given by the  appellant's  father  is
    that on that  occasion  the  appellant  did  express  remorse  for  his
    previous criminality and the effect that it had had on others.

78. I turn now to deal with the OASys report.  That assesses the  appellant
    as presenting a high risk to the public in the community and  a  medium
    risk to known adults.  There was also a medium risk to prisoners whilst
    in custody.

79. The information in the OASys report about the appellant's bad behaviour
    and poor compliance with the prison regime  was  not  disputed  by  the
    appellant and is otherwise consistent with his behaviour prior  to  his
    imprisonment.  There is a date on the OASys report in  the  top  right-
    hand corner of each page, being 12 July 2017.  However, it seems to  me
    to be likely that that is the date that the report  was  accessed.   It
    was sent to the Tribunal as an attachment to an e-mail  dated  12  July
    2017 from the Presenting Officer's Unit.   There  is  no  date  on  the
    report as to when it was compiled, although there is  a  date  for  the
    completion of the self-assessment questionnaire, being 18  April  2016.
    The appellant was  not  released  from  custody  until  19  June  2017,
    according to his most recent  witness  statement  at  [5].   The  OASys
    report refers to his being due to be released  on  16  September  2016,
    which may be an indication that the appellant's earliest  release  date
    was put back because of his  behaviour  whilst  detained,  although  no
    information in that regard was before me.  But reverting to  the  issue
    of the date of the report, it must have been compiled some time between
    18 April 2016 and 16 September 2016, the former of the dates being  the
    date of the self-assessment questionnaire, and the latter being a  date
    for his release which by the date of the compiling of  the  report  had
    not yet taken place.

80. Therefore, there  is  an  assessment  which  is  relatively  recent  in
    relation to the risks that the appellant poses in terms of  reoffending
    and the harm that he may cause, that assessment having taken  place  in
    2016.

81. It is true that the author of the report is not identified.   Mr  Malik
    submitted that without the detail of any qualifications of  the  author
    of the report, it could not be regarded, as suggested on behalf of  the
    respondent, as an expert assessment.  Indeed, his submission  was  that
    the OASys report was "almost worthless".  I disagree.

82. It can reasonably be assumed that, albeit that the author of the report
    is not identified, the report  was  the  result  of  an  assessment  by
    someone qualified to make that assessment, a person from  the  National
    Offender Management Service.  It would seem to me to  be  inconceivable
    that a person without the necessary expertise  would  be  permitted  to
    compile an OASys assessment.  Furthermore, I doubt very  much  whether,
    had the author of the report been identified, any submission would have
    been made to the effect that the author's qualifications had  not  been
    provided.  It  is  the  mere  absence  of  a  name  that  prompted  the
    contention that the expertise of the author was not known.

83. In addition, whilst it has been necessary to make some deductions  from
    the content of the report to establish  the  date  upon  which  it  was
    compiled, or at least within what approximate period, a time period can
    be deduced, as I have indicated, of between April and September 2016.

84. It is true, as suggested on behalf of the appellant,  that  assessments
    in the life of a young person may, in effect, become dated rather  more
    quickly than would otherwise be the case.  However, I do consider  that
    the OASys report in this case, dated  relatively  recently,  does  have
    evidential value and I accept what it says about  the  risks  that  the
    appellant represents.

85. It is not just the OASys assessment which indicates the  risk  that  he
    poses, but the fact that the appellant has been involved in criminality
    of one sort or another within a spectrum of offences, since  2012.   It
    is evident that his offending was escalating.  It is similarly  evident
    that his period in custody failed to bring about  any  modification  in
    his behaviour judging by his conduct whilst detained.  He has only been
    at liberty for a relatively short period of time.

86. I accept the appellant's father's evidence as to what he  was  told  by
    the appellant in terms of his expressions of remorse and regret for his
    offending.  I similarly accept that the appellant has insight into  how
    his offending has affected others, and himself.  I  see  no  reason  to
    doubt the appellant's present commitment not to  reoffend;  he  readily
    accepted his involvement in gangs and criminal offending,  although  it
    would have been difficult for him to do otherwise in the light  of  the
    evidence. However, his evidence  of  the  impact  of  his  offences  on
    himself and others was both thoughtful and insightful.

87. I also bear in mind the courses that the appellant has completed whilst
    detained, evidenced by certificates ranging  from  art  and  design  to
    drugs awareness courses. There is also a positive report from HMP Verne
    which is undated but which relates to a period from his reception there
    on 22 September 2016, and his  behaviour  there,  at  least  from  that
    single report, was very different  from  that  revealed  in  the  OASys
    report in the period 18 April 2016 and 16 September 2016.

88. However, I do consider that there was some element of  minimisation  of
    his  behaviour  in   relation   to   his   conduct   whilst   detained,
    notwithstanding what the appellant  said  about  the  difficulties  and
    hardships of serving a custodial sentence and the pressures that may be
    brought to bear by other offenders.  It must be the case however,  that
    not all those detained behave in the way that the appellant did  during
    his last custodial sentence in the period  referred  to  in  the  OASys
    report, that is in resisting or failing to comply  with  the  detention
    regime.

89. A not unrelated issue is in relation to what I regard  as  a  different
    attempt by the appellant  to  shape  the  evidence  to  his  advantage,
    concerning his ability in the French language.  His  and  his  father's
    evidence was inconsistent in terms of the appellant's ability to  speak
    French, and the appellant sought to minimise that  ability.  I  do  not
    need to repeat the  evidence  that  was  given.  Suffice  to  say,  the
    appellant's father said that French is spoken at home, and that when he
    visited the appellant in custody he spoke to him in French.  I  do  not
    conclude that the appellant is fluent in French, but my  assessment  of
    his evidence is that his  French  is  better  than  he  would  have  me
    believe.

90.  Whilst  I  have  indicated  that  I  accept  the  appellant's  present
    expression of intention not to  reoffend,  I  have  considerable  doubt
    about whether that commitment can be sustained for  more  than  a  very
    short period,  indeed  for  more  than  the  period  during  which  the
    deportation proceedings hang over him.  There is in my judgement  merit
    in the submissions made on behalf of the respondent to the effect  that
    the appellant has  poor  impulse  control.   That  is  evident  in  his
    offending and in his behaviour whilst detained.  It is also apparent in
    the  offence  which  he  himself  described  of   racially   aggravated
    harassment whereby he ran away from  transport  staff  because  he  had
    evaded the fare, was in possession of cannabis and then racially abused
    a police officer seeking to detain him.  More than that, his  offending
    overall demonstrates that poor impulse control.  His family have not in
    the past been able to exercise much, if any, control over him  once  he
    started offending and the appellant allowed himself to become  involved
    in gang culture.  Indeed, even on the appellant's own evidence, when he
    ceased associating with the  so-called  YBC  gang  he  still  continued
    offending.

91. It is clear that offences of  robbery,  having  offensive  weapons  and
    assault are serious offences.   They  clearly  do  affect  one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society which need not be spelt out.   In  all
    the circumstances, I am satisfied that the appellant does  represent  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society.

92.  However,  that  is  not  to  say  that  there  are  no  prospects  for
    rehabilitation.  Rehabilitation is a factor to be taken into account in
    the assessment of proportionality.  It is the case that  the  appellant
    has very little connection with France, although as  I  have  said  the
    appellant sought to minimise his French language ability. He  would  be
    able on return  to  France  to  communicate  effectively  and  whatever
    limitations there are in his French language ability are likely, at his
    young age, to be quickly improved.

93. There is little however, to indicate that there are family  members  in
    France who themselves could assist the appellant in  integrating  there
    and rehabilitating himself.  The FtJ found,  without  error,  that  the
    appellant has very little connection with France, beyond  the  fact  of
    his and his family's nationality, and I would add language.

94. I have taken into account the extent to which  the  appellant's  family
    may be able  to  provide  for  him  financially  in  France  whilst  he
    establishes himself.  There is evidence that the appellant's father  is
    in employment, as is his mother. I consider it  likely  that  at  least
    some financial support would be provided to the appellant sufficient to
    allow him to be accommodated and for his basic  needs  to  be  provided
    for, even if he would not be able to live with his  father's  relatives
    because of their age or infirmity.

95. However, the UK is for practical purposes the  only  country  that  the
    appellant has known, and he is still relatively young. He came  to  the
    UK when he was no older than two  years  of  age.   The  prospects  for
    rehabilitation in France in my judgment are not very promising at  all,
    whereas in the UK he will have family support, albeit that in the  past
    that has not prevented him from reoffending.   I  accept  his  evidence
    that he is undertaking voluntary work and that he is spending more time
    with his (law-abiding) brother. His brother attended the hearing.   The
    appellant does have a commitment not to reoffend,  notwithstanding  the
    limitations on that commitment to which I have referred.

96. I have considered the issue of  rehabilitation  in  the  light  of  the
    authorities, for example  Essa  V  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2012] EWCA Civ 1718, and Dumliauskas, and what was said  in
    those decisions about the relative prospects of rehabilitation.

97. I have also taken into account the factors set out in reg  21(6),  some
    of which I have already referred to. The appellant has resided  in  the
    UK for 20 years and is now aged 22 years. There is nothing to  indicate
    that he is in anything other than good health. His family situation  is
    apparent from the evidence I have referred to above. The evidence  does
    tend to show that the appellant has become closer to his  family  since
    his, albeit recent, release from custody. He is not in employment given
    his present circumstances.

98. His social and cultural integration has been significantly  impeded  by
    his offending since 2012, although having come to  the  UK  at  a  very
    young age, he will have achieved a level  of  integration  up  to  that
    point, when he was 15 years of age. I have already made  an  assessment
    of the links that he has with France.

99. Reflecting on all the circumstances, notwithstanding that the appellant
    represents a genuine present and sufficiently serious threat  affecting
    one of the fundamental interests of society, I cannot conclude that the
    decision to remove him to France, a country in respect of which  he  is
    effectively a stranger, is a proportionate measure. Unlike  deportation
    of nationals from non-EEA States, deportation of EEA  nationals  cannot
    be effected simply as a means of  deterrence  to  others,  and  such  a
    person's convictions alone cannot in law justify a decision to  deport.
    Proportionality of course, is an entirely separate  consideration  from
    the risk of reoffending, as is clear from reg 21(5)(a) and (c)  of  the
    EEA Regulations, and the decision to deportation must comply  with  the
    principle of proportionality.

100. In coming to the conclusion that the appellant's deportation is  not  a
    proportionate  measure,  I  have  had  regard  to  the  nature  of  the
    appellant's offending and the nature of any potential future  offending
    which is likely to be of the same or similar nature to the offences  he
    has committed to date. It is undoubtedly  serious  offending,  but  the
    proportionality balance nevertheless falls in favour of  the  appellant
    in the light of the comparative rehabilitative prospects  that  I  have
    referred to, and his lack of sufficiently meaningful  connections  with
    France.

101. It  should  not  need  to  be  said,  but  further  offending  by  this
    appellant, regardless of explanations or excuses, is likely  to  result
    in an adjustment of the assessment of the extent to which the appellant
    is willing or able to rehabilitate himself in any country.   Therefore,
    the effect of further offending is very likely to mean his expulsion to
    France and his removal from the UK, his family and the society to which
    the appellant is used.

    Decision

102. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
    error on a point of law.  Its decision having been set aside,  I  allow
    the appeal with reference to the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 (as amended).

Solicitors


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


 1. The appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of State.  However,
    I refer to the parties as they  were  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    ("FtT").

 2. The appellant is a citizen of France, born in 1995. A decision was made
    on 12 November 2015 to make a deportation order against him pursuant to
    the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006  ("the  2006
    Regulations") following his convictions for criminal offences.

 3. His appeal against the respondent's  decision  came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Eldridge ("the FtJ") on 31 January 2017 following which
    the appeal was allowed.

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The FtJ summarised the appellant's offending history as set out in  the
    respondent's decision.  This is to the effect that on 9 September  2014
    he was convicted of offences of  possessing  an  offensive  weapon  and
    affray for which he received a sentence of eight months' detention in a
    young offenders' institution.  On 23 April 2015 he was sentenced to  16
    weeks in a young offenders' institution for burglary, possession  of  a
    controlled drug, assault on a constable and criminal damage.  His  most
    recent conviction was on 15 October 2015 in the Crown Court at Basildon
    for offences of robbery and damaging property for which he  received  a
    sentence of 30 months' detention in a young offenders' institution.

 5. Under a subheading entitled "credibility and findings" the FtJ referred
    to the appellant's account of having come to the UK with his mother  on
    24 April 1997 and having remained here ever since.  He apparently  left
    home at the age of 16, became involved with gangs and began  to  commit
    criminal offences, starting with a conviction for theft by  shoplifting
    in March 2012 and culminating  in  repeated  offences  leading  to  the
    offences already described.  He apparently has had problems with  drink
    and drugs.

 6. The FtJ referred to the supplementary decision letter dated 23  January
    2017 whereby the respondent accepted that the appellant  had  lived  in
    the UK for at least 10 years but not that the appellant had acquired  a
    permanent  right  of  residence.   That  was  because  the   respondent
    concluded  that  it  had  not  been  shown  that  the   appellant   had
    comprehensive sickness insurance for the period  during  which  he  was
    attending school.  The FtJ was satisfied that the  appellant  had  been
    living in the UK since 1997.

 7. The FtJ concluded that by the time he first went to prison in September
    2014 he had lived in the UK for about 17 years, and that  it  was  only
    for about 18 or 19 months from birth that he had not lived in  the  UK.
    He said that the appellant's continuous  residence  had  however,  been
    broken by the terms of imprisonment, beginning with the  eight  months'
    sentence imposed in September 2014 in the Crown  Court  at  Snaresbrook
    (possession of an offensive weapon  and  affray).   Therefore,  on  the
    "counting back" principle, his continuous residence was broken  and  he
    could not  meet  the  requirement  of  10  years'  residence,  the  FtJ
    concluded.

 8. At [21] the FtJ identified the issue as being whether the appellant has
    a permanent right of residence, meaning that his removal could only  be
    justified on serious grounds of public policy or public  security.   He
    said that it would appear that the appellant had  an  argument  to  the
    effect that he had acquired that permanent  right  of  residence  after
    living in the UK for five years, that is, in 2002  at  the  age  of  6�
    years.

 9. However, he referred to the respondent's decision which sought to argue
    that the appellant was a student, attending school, over a period of 11
    years or more  and  that  he  needed  to  have  comprehensive  sickness
    insurance in the UK.  The FtJ did not accept that argument.  He said as
    follows:

         "That was a provision on my understanding that did  not  come  into
         force until 2012, by  which  time  the  Appellant  had  long  since
         acquired a permanent right of residence.  He is  thus  entitled  to
         the additional protection afforded by Regulation 21(3)  as  I  have
         just quoted".

10. He then referred to the appellant having grown up in the UK and at  the
    time of the hearing being aged 21.  He came to the UK as a toddler  and
    has known no other life.  He found that although his  later  teens  had
    been characterised by criminality, the appellant  had  nevertheless  no
    real connection with France beyond the fact of his nationality and that
    of his immediate family.  Although he may have visited France,  he  had
    no ties there and his life had always been in the UK for as long as  he
    could remember.

11. At [23] he said that the appellant had a  poor  record  of  criminality
    over the last four years.  He  was  a  relatively  persistent  offender
    across the criminal spectrum with offences of dishonesty and possession
    of street drugs and the serious offences against the  person  involving
    robbery, assault on a police constable, affray  and  possession  of  an
    offensive weapon.  He concluded that the appellant's offending appeared
    to have escalated since he left home at the age of 16 and only to  have
    been controlled when  sentenced  to  a  relatively  lengthy  period  of
    imprisonment of 30 months.

12. At [24] he referred to what he said was a considerable contrast between
    the principles of deterrence and public revulsion that are pertinent in
    the deportation of "foreign criminals" under the UK  Borders  Act  2007
    and the position of EEA nationals.  He stated that issues of deterrence
    can play no part in the decision to remove under the regime applying to
    EEA nationals.  Except in respect of the most serious of  offences,  no
    perceived need to reflect public revulsion can have any part to play in
    the removal decision.

13. He  identified  the  further  issue  as  being  whether  the  appellant
    "presents a genuine and sufficiently serious threat to the  fundamental
    interests of society".  At [26] he noted that the  respondent  had  not
    provided any report  from  the  National  Offender  Management  Service
    ("NOMS") to demonstrate that the  appellant  represented  a  particular
    risk of  reoffending  "in  a  manner  prejudicial  to  the  fundamental
    interest  of  society".   He  acknowledged  that  extracts   from   the
    sentencing remarks in relation to the offence in 2015 resulting  in  30
    months' detention had been provided.  He noted that a weapon  had  been
    used but that the sentencing remarks did not deal with  the  issues  of
    future threat.  He then said however, that the propensity of  offending
    over a relatively short period of time may be taken  to  indicate  some
    future risk.

14. In the next paragraph he  nevertheless  said  that  the  appellant  had
    produced some evidence to counter the assertion of future  risk,  being
    evidence of working, in the tax year ending 5 April 2016, and  that  he
    had provided payslips for most of  the  rest  of  2016.   He  had  also
    provided evidence of courses attended whilst in  detention,  noting  in
    particular a two-week Intensive Group dealing  with  drug  and  alcohol
    awareness, the impact of drugs on  the  community  and  strategies  for
    avoiding the risk of drugs, and the impact on others.  He  referred  to
    prison officers having spoken positively of the appellant and the trust
    that could be reposed in him.

15. The FtJ concluded at [28] that factors pertinent to reg  21(6)  of  the
    2006 Regulations, had not been adequately weighed by the respondent and
    the respondent's decision did not appear to demonstrate the very  plain
    need to balance the principles of the freedom of movement  against  the
    factors that the respondent relied on.

16. Again, in that same paragraph the FtJ referred to the appellant  having
    lived in the UK for almost all his  life  from  about  the  age  of  18
    months, that his family is in the UK and he knows only the life  to  be
    enjoyed by residing here.  He stated that the appellant has a permanent
    right of  residence  and  must  be  seen  as  being  wholly  culturally
    integrated into the United Kingdom, with no effective ties  to  France.
    His offending had been as a young man  in  his  late  teens.   He  then
    stated that "There is, and can be, no firm assessment of future  risk",
    but  he  has  demonstrated  a  change  in  behaviour  and  an  apparent
    willingness  to  learn,  albeit  within  the   constrained   and   safe
    environment of detention.

17. He therefore concluded that the appellant had not been shown "to pose a
    sufficiently  serious  threat  to  public   policy   to   justify   his
    deportation", notwithstanding the nature and character of his  previous
    offending.

    Submissions

18. In submissions Mr Jarvis argued that in order for the appellant  to  be
    able to rely on 10 years' residence he would have to first of all  have
    acquired a permanent  right  of  residence.   In  that  respect  I  was
    referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Warsame v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 16, in  particular  at
    [9] and [10].

19. Even if that was wrong, and  the  appellant  does  not  need  first  to
    establish a permanent right of residence, it was submitted  that  there
    still needed to be an assessment  of  the  extent  of  the  appellant's
    integration in the UK, in terms of what he has been doing  and  whether
    he has been exercising Treaty rights.  In this case  the  appellant  is
    unable to show any period of qualifying residence, albeit that that was
    not determinative.

20. The FtJ in this case did  not  decide  positively  in  the  appellant's
    favour in terms  of  whether  he  represented  a  genuine  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society, although that could perhaps be  inferred  by  [29]  of  the
    decision where the FtJ said that the appellant had not  been  shown  to
    pose a sufficiently serious risk to public policy.   In  terms  of  the
    imperative grounds, the substance of the 10 year period  had  not  been
    assessed.

21. The conclusion that the appellant as a student did  not  need  to  show
    comprehensive sickness insurance cover, because that  requirement  only
    came into force in 2012, is wrong.  I was referred to  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Order 1994 at article 6(2)(h).

22. It was further submitted that the FtJ needed to have engaged  with  the
    appellant's  conduct  prior  to  his  imprisonment,  in  terms  of   an
    assessment of whether he had integrated.

23. In addition, it was submitted that it appears from [29]  that  the  FtJ
    concluded that the appellant was only entitled to the lowest  level  of
    protection,  because  he  referred  to  the  appellant  not  posing   a
    sufficiently serious risk to "public policy".  If that is the case,  it
    was submitted that the FtJ had  not  explained  why  the  offences  the
    appellant had committed do not meet  the  public  policy  threshold  in
    terms of that lowest level of protection from deportation.

24. Ms Alexander made her submissions with the disadvantage of  not  having
    been properly briefed by her instructing solicitors.  It  appears  that
    she understood that the hearing before me was an  oral  renewal  of  an
    application for permission to bring judicial review proceedings,  which
    is how her skeleton argument is described.  Similarly, at the start  of
    the hearing she did not have before  her  a  full  copy  of  the  FtJ's
    decision.  Nevertheless, those deficiencies in the information provided
    to Ms Alexander were made good during the course of the hearing and she
    did not suggest that she  was  unable  to  proceed  and  there  was  no
    application for an adjournment.

25. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that he was able to benefit
    from his having been in the UK for a 10 year period, thus entitling him
    to the highest level of protection.  The  respondent's  assertion  that
    the appellant needed to establish a permanent right of residence  first
    was rejected.

26. In any event, at all times the appellant's parents had  been  in  full-
    time employment, although Ms Alexander was not able to demonstrate that
    evidence to support that assertion was before the FtJ.

27. It was argued that the respondent had a  duty  to  make  enquiries  (in
    relation to the exercise of Treaty rights by the appellant's  parents).
    Although a subject access request could have been made, that would have
    taken 40 working days.  The appellant's solicitors had sought from  the
    respondent certain documents,  including  a  pre-sentence  report,  the
    appellant's antecedents and a MAPPA  report.   The  witness  statements
    state that his parents had been in employment and had never resorted to
    benefits.  Enquiries in that  respect  could  have  been  made  by  the
    Secretary of State.

28. It was submitted that even if the appellant was not entitled to  resist
    removal on imperative grounds, he was entitled to  the  next  level  of
    protection, that is serious grounds of  public  policy.   It  was  also
    submitted that the respondent had not  considered  the  proportionately
    issues that needed to be assessed.

29. As to whether the  FtJ  was  wrong  to  say  that  for  a  student  the
    requirement of comprehensive insurance was only introduced in 2012,  Ms
    Alexander said that she was not  able  to  answer  the  question  posed
    without "further details".

30. Reliance was placed on the decision in Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department v MG [2014] EUECJ C-400/12, it being submitted that in  that
    case the offending by the individual was much worse than that  of  this
    appellant.

31. In reply, Mr Jarvis submitted that it was  simply  wrong  to  say  that
    there was no challenge on behalf of the respondent to the issue of  the
    exercise of Treaty rights, as this is referred to in  the  respondent's
    decision.  Furthermore, the decision letter does deal  in  detail  with
    the issue of proportionality.

32. There was no duty  on  the  respondent  to  make  any  enquiries.   The
    appellant was told that it was intended to deport him and he was  asked
    if he wanted to make any representations.  There was  no  duty  on  the
    respondent to delve  into  the  parents'  records  in  terms  of  their
    employment, and indeed his parents may not have wanted them to  do  so.
    The burden of proof was on the appellant.

    Conclusions

33. The skeleton argument on behalf of the appellant was  not  directed  to
    the matters in issue at the hearing before me. It is  expressly  stated
    as being grounds in support of an application for permission  to  bring
    judicial review proceedings in respect of the deportation decision  and
    in relation to removal directions.

34. Indeed, the submissions of both parties at  times  strayed  beyond  the
    relevant  issues.   For  example,  both  parties  made  submissions  in
    relation to the extent to which  the  appellant  was  entitled  to  the
    benefit of the highest level of protection  of  imperative  grounds  of
    public security, by reason of 10 years' residence.  In fact, this is  a
    matter that was resolved against the appellant by the FtJ and there has
    been no cross-appeal on behalf of  the  appellant  in  respect  of  his
    conclusions to that effect.  Thus,  at  [20]  the  FtJ  said  that  the
    appellant's period of continuous residence had been broken by the terms
    of imprisonment beginning with the eight months  imposed  in  September
    2014 in the Crown Court at Snaresbrook.  He said that on the  "counting
    back" principle, the period of continuous residence was broken and that
    he therefore could not meet the 10 years' requirement.

35. Neither party suggested to me that the  imperative  grounds  issue  was
    relevant to the materiality of any (other) error of law on the part  of
    the FtJ.  In other words, it was not suggested that even if the FtJ was
    wrong in his assessment of the appellant's entitlement to protection on
    the ground that he has permanent  residence,  such  an  error  was  not
    material given that the appellant was entitled to the highest level  of
    protection of imperative grounds.

36. It may have been  open  to  the  appellant  to  argue  that  the  FtT's
    conclusion that he was not entitled to the highest level of  protection
    on imperative grounds was  in  error  because  his  decision  does  not
    reflect the more nuanced approach reflected in the decisions in MG  and
    Warsame.  The  argument  would  be  that  imprisonment  may  break  the
    continuity of his residence 'in principle' but would not necessarily do
    so depending on an assessment of his integration in the UK.

37. I am satisfied that there is an error of law in the FtJ's  in  relation
    to the issue of the appellant having  acquired  a  permanent  right  of
    residence, and that that error of law is not 'saved' by any argument in
    terms of materiality with reference to the imperative grounds point.

38. In relation then, to permanent right of residence, the FtJ said at [18]
    that the respondent's decision was that the appellant had not  acquired
    a permanent right of residence because it had not been  shown  that  he
    had comprehensive sickness insurance for the period  he  was  attending
    school.  In fact, the respondent's supplementary decision letter  dated
    23 January 2017, to which the FtJ was making reference in this respect,
    also states that there was no evidence to  show  that  the  appellant's
    parents were exercising Treaty rights, or  that  he  had  comprehensive
    sickness insurance whilst he was attending school, in  accordance  with
    reg 4(1).

39. Ms Alexander submitted that the appellant's parents  had  been  working
    throughout that time.  However, it is not apparent that any evidence to
    that effect was put before the FtJ, and even if it was,  there  was  no
    assessment of it.

40. On the question of the need for comprehensive sickness  insurance,  the
    FtJ's understanding that that requirement did not come into force until
    2012 is in error.  Indeed, it may even be that the  appellant  did  not
    come within the definition of student for other reasons.   The  FtJ  at
    [18] referred to a letter from a primary  school  in  relation  to  the
    appellant's attendance there, although the dates  given  in  the  FtJ's
    decision are slightly muddled.  The letter is from Carpenter's  Primary
    School apparently confirming his attendance from 11 February 2000 to 14
    October 2005.  There is another letter from Kingswood Community  School
    in relation to attendance between 3 September 2007 and 20 July 2012.

41. The Immigration (European Economic Area) Order 1994 ("the 1994  Order")
    to which I was referred, at article 6(2)(h) provides as follows:

         "a student" means a person who -

         (i)  is enrolled at a recognised educational establishment  in  the
             United Kingdom  for  the  principal  purpose  of  following  a
             vocational training course,

         (ii) has sufficient resource to avoid his becoming a burden on  the
             social assistance system of the United Kingdom, and

         (iii)    is covered by sickness insurance in respect of  all  risks
             in the United Kingdom".

42. That Order came into force on 20 July 1994.  The Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2000  ("the  2000  Regulations")  came  into
    force on 2 October 2000.  So far as the  definition  of  a  student  is
    concerned,  in  the  2000  Regulations  reg  3(1)  contains  an  almost
    identical definition of 'student' to that in the 1994 Order,  the  only
    difference being that whereas in the 1994 Order a person needs to  have
    sufficient resources etc., the 2000 Regulations require an assurance by
    way of declaration to that effect.

43. Accordingly, both when the appellant started his schooling, and from  2
    October 2000, there was the need for sickness  insurance  in  order  to
    come within the definition of student.

44. The  2006  Regulations  came  into  force  on  30 April  2006.   Those
    Regulations governed the period of time up until the  appellant  ceased
    schooling on 20 July 2012, according to the evidence before the FtJ.

45. In reg 4(1)(d) the term 'student' means a person who:

         "(i) is enrolled, for the principal purpose of following course  of
             study (including vocational training), at a public or  private
             establishment which is -

             (aa) financed from public funds; or

             (bb) otherwise recognised by the  Secretary  of  State  as  an
                  establishment which has been accredited for the purpose of
                  providing such courses  or  training  within  the  law  or
                  administrative practice of the part of the United  Kingdom
                  in which the establishment is located;

         (ii) has comprehensive  sickness  insurance  cover  in  the  United
             Kingdom ...".

46. In other words, the requirement of sickness insurance  "in  respect  of
    all  risks"  in  the  1994  Order  and  the   2000   Regulations,   and
    "comprehensive sickness insurance" in the  EEA  Regulations  2006,  has
    always existed.  It may be  that  where  the  FtJ  suggested  that  the
    requirement of sickness insurance was only introduced in 2012, this may
    be because of amendments to the EEA Regulations 2006 brought in from 16
    July 2012 by SI 2012/1547, but those amendments were not in respect  of
    the issue of sickness insurance.

47. I mentioned earlier that in fact the appellant may not have come within
    the definition of student at all, at least in relation to  his  earlier
    schooling, because a student prior to the 2006 Regulations was a person
    enrolled at a recognised educational establishment "for  the  principal
    purpose of following a vocational training  course".   That  would  not
    have included primary education.  The 2006 Regulations would, it seems,
    include such education because the requirement  for  a  student  to  be
    following a  vocational  course  was  no  longer  present,  although  a
    vocational course was included in the definition.

48. There is no evidence that the appellant had sickness insurance  of  any
    sort covering  the  period  when  he  was  a  student.   He  could  not
    therefore, have come within the definition of student.  Likewise, there
    was no evidence before the FtJ of the exercise of Treaty rights by  the
    appellant's parents.  In all those circumstances, the FtJ was in  error
    in concluding that the appellant had established that he had acquired a
    permanent right of residence.  The evidence simply did not support that
    conclusion.

49. Although not specifically a matter raised in the written grounds, I  am
    satisfied that the issue of the assessment of risk of further offending
    is related to the written grounds as advanced.  This was a matter which
    was touched on in submissions on behalf of the  respondent  before  me.
    The risk of reoffending is a matter that needed to be assessed  in  the
    context of whether the appellant  represents  a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat, affecting one of the fundamental interests
    of society.

50. At [26] the FtJ said that the respondent  had  not  provided  any  NOMS
    report, although pointing out that the  propensity  to  offend  over  a
    relatively short period of time may be taken to  indicate  some  future
    risk.  He referred at  [27]  to  the  appellant's  employment  and  the
    courses he had undertaken, as well as the positive comments from prison
    officers.  On the other hand, he said this at [28]:

         "There is and can be no firm assessment future risk  (sic)  but  he
         has demonstrated a change in behaviour and an apparent  willingness
         to learn, albeit within the constrained  and  safe  environment  of
         detention".

51. I cannot see in those aspects  of  the  FtJ's  decision,  or  from  the
    decision as a whole, a clear assessment of whether the  appellant  does
    or does not represent a 'genuine and present threat'. In  other  words,
    there is no clear assessment of the risk of reoffending.   He  referred
    to the information that may have a bearing on that issue, but  came  to
    no clear conclusion.  I consider that in this  respect  also,  the  FtJ
    erred in law.

52. The errors of law are such as to require the decision to be set  aside.
    I canvassed with the parties the question of whether, if  I  set  aside
    the decision of the FtJ, the matter should be retained for re-making in
    the Upper Tribunal or remitted to the FtT.  I have concluded that it is
    not appropriate for the appeal to be remitted to the FtT given the fact
    that there are some findings which are not infected by the error of law
    and the further  fact-finding  exercise  is  not  such  as  to  require
    remittal. I also bear in mind that the appellant is presently detained.

53. Accordingly, the appeal will be retained in the Upper Tribunal for  the
    re-making of the decision.  To  that  end,  the  parties  are  to  have
    careful regard to the directions set out below.




                               DIRECTIONS

      i) In respect of any further evidence that either party seeks to  rely
         on, that evidence must be filed and served no later than seven days
         before the next date of hearing.

     ii) In respect of any witness whom it is proposed to call to give  oral
         evidence, there must be a witness  statement  drawn  in  sufficient
         detail to stand as evidence-in-chief, such that there  is  no  need
         for any further examination-in-chief.

    iii) If further evidence is relied on on behalf of the appellant,  there
         must be a comprehensive paginated and indexed bundle  to  be  filed
         and served no later  than  seven  days  before  the  next  date  of
