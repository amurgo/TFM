                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nepal who  has  been  granted  leave  to
      appeal  the  determination  of  an  Adjudicator  (Ms  C.  J.   Wright)
      dismissing his appeal against the Respondent's decision to  refuse  to
      grant him leave to enter the United Kingdom and to refuse asylum.


   2. Ms S. Sharma of Counsel instructed by Davies Blundon and Evans appears
      for the Appellant.  Mr S. Walker  a  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer
      represents the Respondent.

   3. The Appellant arrived in United Kingdom on 13  May  2001  and  claimed
      asylum.  The notice containing the decision against which  he  appeals
      is dated 24 June 2001. The Adjudicator heard the  appeal  on  3  April
      2002 and leave to appeal was granted on 24 June 2002.


   4. The Adjudicator found that the Appellant was a credible witness.   She
      accepted, in paragraph 10 of her determination, that he was  a  farmer
      in Nepal, married with four young  children,  who  had  never  been  a
      member of a political party.  The Maoists had tried  to  recruit  him.
      In February 2001 a group of them came to his home to try and  persuade
      him to join them and to obtain a gun, which he kept.  He  handed  this
      over.  He  and  his  family  were  threatened  and  intimidated.   The
      Appellant went to the police, even though the nearest  police  station
      was four hours walk away.  There was no vehicular access to his  area.
      The Appellant was able to identify one of the  men  who  came  to  his
      house and the police arrested that  man.   Subsequently,  a  group  of
      Maoists went to the Appellant's home, but he was not there.  They told
      his wife that if they caught him they would take  revenge  because  he
      had informed on them.  The Appellant decided to leave, fled to  India,
      and worked there for approximately two and a half months before making
      arrangements to come to the United Kingdom with  financial  help  from
      his uncle.  His wife and four young children remain in Nepal.


   5. The Adjudicator went on to find that the Appellant came from  an  area
      where the Maoists were  not  in  control.   He  was  not  particularly
      targeted by them and did not face any greater risk  than  an  ordinary
      citizen  of  Nepal.   He  could  move  to  another  part   of   Nepal,
      particularly one not controlled by the Maoists, and  resume  a  normal
      life.  He might be difficult for him to find a job, but  he  had  been
      able to find a job when he spent time in Delhi.  He would  not  be  at
      risk of harassment or persecution by the Maoists if he returned  to  a
      part of Nepal other than his home area.  The Adjudicator dismissed the
      human rights and Refugee Convention appeals.


   6. Mr Walker submitted that the Maoists in other parts of Nepal would not
      know that the Appellant was an informer.  He had never been a  Maoists
      and had provided them with his gun when they demanded it.  It was  not
      likely that they would identify him in  another  part  of  Nepal.   Mr
      Walker conceded that the Adjudicator did not  specify  which  part  of
      Nepal the Appellant could go to.  He also accepted there were  Maoists
      throughout Nepal and the country information  showed  that  they  took
      revenge on informers.


   7. The Adjudicator did not make a specific  finding  that  the  Appellant
      would be at risk of persecution or infringement of his human rights in
      his home area.  However, her other findings imply that she did in fact
      reach this conclusion.  She found that the Maoists in  his  home  area
      had threatened the Appellant.  She found that they targeted  suspected
      informers (paragraph 10 (c) of the determination).   She  went  on  to
      consider internal flight to another part of  Nepal,  which  would  not
      have been necessary had she not decided that the Appellant was not  at
      risk in his home area. She found that the police would not be able  to
      provide him with a sufficiency of protection in his  home  area.   She
      would not have needed to consider sufficiency of protection if he  was
      not at risk.

   8. To make clear that which the Adjudicator did not make clear;  we  find
      that the Appellant would be at risk from the Maoists in his home area.
       The country information shows that they take  revenge  on  informers.
      In the light of the Adjudicator's findings of fact, they would  regard
      him as an informer.  In his home area he has a  well-founded  fear  of
      persecution  for  a  Convention  reason,  namely  perceived  political
      opinions contrary to those of the Maoists, and he faces a real risk of
      infringement of  his  human  rights  under  Article  3.   The  country
      information shows that the Maoists are likely to be violent and severe
      in exacting revenge.


   9. It appears that the Adjudicator went on to consider  whether  internal
      flight would be unduly harsh, although she does not specifically refer
      to the appropriate test.  We agree with her conclusion that  it  would
      be difficult for a farmer to find a job in another part of Nepal.  The
      fact that the Maoists did not find him when he was working in Delhi is
      not particularly relevant to the question of whether they  would  find
      him in Nepal.  The observation that the Appellant is not likely to  be
      at risk in another part of Nepal because the Maoists have already  got
      his gun flies in the face of the Adjudicator's other conclusions, that
      they were looking for him because he had  informed  on  one  of  their
      colleagues and that Maoists exact revenge  on  those  they  regard  as
      informers.


  10. The country information shows that there are Maoists throughout Nepal.
      They are well organised and numerous. They are likely  to  be  looking
      for him in his home area, where he would be  at  risk.   Against  this
      background there is a real  risk  that  he  would  be  identified  and
      targeted by them in any part of Nepal.  We find that  he  is  at  risk
      throughout Nepal.  Even if we are mistaken in this regard, in all  the
      circumstances we find that it would be unduly harsh to expect  him  to
      relocate.


  11. The Appellant has established a well-founded fear of persecution for a
      Convention reason and that his Article 3 human rights are likely to be
      infringed.


  12. We allow the appeal.
