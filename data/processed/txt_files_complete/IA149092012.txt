For the Appellant:     Mr D Coleman, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms  S  Vidyadnaran,  Senior  Home  Office  Presenting
                       Officer

Details of appellant and basis of claim

   1.       This appeal comes before me following the grant of permission on
      13 March 2013 by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Chalkley  in  respect  of  the
      determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Cohen  who  dismissed  the
      appeal following a hearing at Taylor House on 4 October 2012 by way of
      a determination promulgated on 5 November 2012.

   2.       The appellant is a Nigerian national born on 11 August 1969. She
      appeals against the decision of the respondent to cancel her leave  as
      a Tier 1 Migrant under paragraph 321(A) on 19 June 2012 on  the  basis
      that she had misrepresented her income with a view  to  obtaining  her
      Tier 1 leave. Her husband and four children  are  dependent  upon  her
      application.

   3.       The judge has been accused  of  making  various  factual  errors
      which are  said  to  have  infected  his  determination.  He  is  also
      criticised for failing to follow the  Razgar  steps  and  for  wrongly
      stating that the appellant's children had spent most of their lives in
      Nigeria.

   4.       Permission was granted on the basis that the  typing  errors  do
      not inspire confidence in the decision.

Appeal hearing

   5.       At the hearing I  heard  submissions  from  the  parties  as  to
      whether the judge made errors of law such as to make his determination
      unsustainable.

   6.       Mr Coleman submitted that the judge had based his  fact  finding
      applying the wrong burden of proof. He had set out the wrong burden in
      paragraph 15; his starting point should have been that the burden  was
      on the respondent. He then expanded upon the grounds put  forward.  He
      submitted that the appellant had never stated that she  had  purchased
      30 computers to sell and the judge's reference to this was  an  error.
      He also submitted that she had never claimed to have paid �9000 in tax
      and that the judge was wrong to have said  she  had  at  paragraph  4.
      Additionally, the judge had wrongly recorded that  the  appellant  had
      claimed to earn �39,345 when she had never said  that.   He  submitted
      that the appellant had four children aged 10, 9, 7 and  4.  The  three
      older children had lived here for five years, the  youngest  had  been
      born here and had never lived in Nigeria. the  judge  had,  therefore,
      based his assessment of the Article 8 claim on the wrong facts as they
      had not lived in Nigeria most of their lives.  Approaching  the  claim
      from that perspective, he had considered it to  be  weak  but  had  he
      realised  the  correct  position  he  may  have  reached  a  different
      conclusion.

   7.       For the respondent, it was argued that the judge  had  not  made
      errors which detracted from his decision. The  date  of  decision  was
      June and not August but that did not impact upon  his  reasoning.  The
      appellant had mentioned paying �9000 in taxes at  her  interview  with
      the interviewing officer, and had said at the hearing that she  earned
      �39,345.  The  judge  could  not  be  blamed  for  referring  to   the
      appellant's own evidence. There was a significant  difference  between
      the appellant's claimed income and that declared to the Inland Revenue
      and that  showed  that  the  appellant  had  falsely  represented  her
      earnings. It had been for the appellant to prove her claim  of  income
      and she had failed to do so. In that sense there was  no  misdirection
      as to the burden of proof. The judge had dealt with the  contradictory
      evidence as best he could. He was right  to  find  there  had  been  a
      deliberate misrepresentation. His adverse findings were open to him to
      make. MK (best interests of child) India [2011] UKUT 00475  (IAC),  EA
      (Article 8 - best interests of child) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00315  (IAC)
      and Shizad (sufficiency of reasons :  set  aside)  [2013]  UKUT  00085
      (IAC) were relied on and I was referred to various paragraphs  therein
      to support the submissions made.  Ms  Vidyadnaran  accepted  that  the
      judge was wrong to have said that the children had  lived  in  Nigeria
      the majority of their lives but he had nevertheless considered all the
      evidence properly and had made  sustainable  findings  on  their  best
      interests which accorded with the case law referred to.  The  children
      were very young and their relationship  with  their  parents  was  the
      pivotal factor. The appellant had no legitimate expectation to  remain
      given her misrepresentation. That must weigh heavily  against  her  in
      the balancing exercise.

   8.       In response Mr Coleman submitted that the  whole  assessment  of
      Article 8  was  made  on  a  factual  misdirection  and  as  such  was
      unsustainable. The case law did not assist in the  circumstances.  The
      judge had punished the children for the errors of  their  mother.  The
      older child had spent the last five years  of  his  life  here;  those
      years were the important ones, more so than  his  younger  years.  The
      judge's error was material and there should be  a  re-hearing  of  the
      appeal.

   9.       At the conclusion of the hearing  I  reserved  my  determination
      which I now give.

Findings and Conclusions

  10.       I have carefully considered all the submissions and the evidence
      before arriving at my conclusions.  I would state at the  outset  that
      the typing errors which are spread throughout  the  determination  and
      which appear to be  the  result  of  voice  recognition  software  not
      operating as it should, are most regrettable however these are not the
      'errors' identified in the grounds .

  11.       As I read it, permission was granted on the assumption that  the
      errors attributed to the judge were indeed made however a  reading  of
      the determination and the evidence shows that is not the case at  all.
      Apart from the error relating to the date of the decision,  which  has
      no impact upon the outcome of the appeal, and the Article 8 error  (to
      which I shall return later) none of the other 'errors' exist.

  12.       The following misdirections are alleged. The judge  is  said  to
      have referred to the appellant's purchase of 30 computers when  it  is
      asserted that this was never part of her evidence. In fact it  can  be
      seen from the appellant's landing card (contained at Annex C2) that it
      was the  appellant  herself  who  provided  this  information  to  the
      Immigration  Officer.  It  is  also  repeated  in  the   notice/report
      cancelling her leave to remain.  For it to be maintained that this was
      a factual error on the part of the judge is wholly  inappropriate  and
      incorrect. This assertion did form part of  the  appellant's  evidence
      and her attempt to deny it only reinforces the judge's adverse view of
      her credibility.

  13.       The judge is  criticised  for  wrongly  giving  the  appellant's
      earnings for 2008-2009 as �39,345 in paragraph 9 of his determination.
      It is maintained that later in his determination he  referred  to  the
      correct figure of �29,345 and that this error adversely  affected  the
      decision. It is not explained how the decision was adversely  affected
      but in any event the reference to the  higher  figure  came  from  the
      recorded evidence of the appellant (which is  confirmed  by  the  hand
      written Record of Proceedings). The error is the appellant's  and  not
      the judge's. Notwithstanding that point, however, it is plain from the
      determination that the judge based his findings on what the  appellant
      maintains is the correct sum (paragraphs  17  and  18);  there  is  no
      reliance placed on  an  incorrect  figure  when  the  conclusions  are
      reached.

  14.       The grounds further argue that the respondent wrongly maintained
      that the appellant had declared lower earnings to the  Inland  Revenue
      so as to pay less tax and that this "vital mistake" affected the whole
      decision. Contrary to this complaint,  the  interview  record  of  the
      appellant discloses very clearly that this declaration  emanated  from
      the appellant herself. As such, the respondent was perfectly justified
      in using it to discredit her integrity  as  was  the  judge.  He  took
      account of her explanation at the hearing that she had only made  this
      statement out of fear but was entitled to reject that as  a  ludicrous
      explanation finding that one would not lie and claim one had committed
      a criminal offence if that was not the case. It should also  be  noted
      that the appellant provided  an  entirely  different  excuse  for  the
      differing figures in her  witness  statement;  there  she  blames  her
      accountants for the mistake.

  15.       At the hearing Mr Coleman added  another  error.  He  maintained
      that the appellant's instructions were that she had never  claimed  to
      have paid �9000 in tax as the judge recorded at  paragraph  4  of  his
      determination. However, as can be seen from her interview  record  (at
      Q.11) she did indeed make this claim.

  16.       It is plain, therefore, that the errors attributed to the  judge
      (as set out above) were not his errors at all. These were all  matters
      taken from the evidence before him; evidence from the appellant  which
      she now seeks to deny. The judge took all this evidence into  account.
      In order for the appellant to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  rules
      relating to Tier 1, she had to show a certain  level  of  income.  The
      contradictory evidence the judge was provided with did not  show  that
      the required level  was  attained.  Indeed  the  reliable  documentary
      evidence showed a much lower figure. The appellant's explanations were
      considered.  The  judge  noted  that  apart   from   the   appellant's
      inconsistent accounts, there were no invoices or business documents to
      substantiate her claimed business activities and the deposits into her
      bank account did  not  accord  with  her  claimed  earnings.  He  also
      considered it implausible that's he  would  have  been  able  to  sell
      �64,000 worth of computers simply as a result of chatting to people at
      the school gates. Given all these factors the  judge's  findings  that
      the  appellant  had  misrepresented  her  situation   and   that   the
      respondent's decision was correct were fully open to him  to  make.  I
      take note of Mr Coleman's submission on  the  burden  of  proof  point
      however in view of the compelling  findings,  all  borne  out  by  the
      evidence, it is plain that no other outcome would have been  possible.
      The appellant, on her own evidence, has misrepresented the  facts.  It
      is  she,  not  the  judge,   who   has   provided   inconsistent   and
      unsatisfactory evidence and in all the circumstances the  decision  of
      the judge to find in the respondent's favour is sustainable.

  17.       I now turn to the criticisms made of  the  judge's  approach  to
      Article 8. It is argued in the grounds that the Razgar steps were  not
      followed. To  be  fair,  Mr  Coleman  did  not  seek  to  pursue  this
      unmeritorious allegation. It may be seen from paragraph  25  that  the
      judge did indeed follow the required steps.

  18.       The only arguable error identified in the grounds  is  the  last
      one where it is maintained that the judge was wrong to have said  that
      the children had spent the majority of their lives in  Nigeria.  Their
      dates of births are 5 September 2002, 23 December  2003,  23  December
      2005 and March 2009. The appellant arrived here with her  husband  and
      three children in October 2007; the youngest was born here. The oldest
      child was five on arrival and has spent just over five years here; the
      other two have spent the larger part  of  their  lives  here  and  the
      youngest is four and  has  never  lived  in  Nigeria.  The  judge  did
      therefore err when he stated that the children had spent the  majority
      of their lives in Nigeria. Nor surprisingly, Mr Coleman made strenuous
      submissions on this  point  and  maintained  that  the  judge's  error
      invalidated all his findings on proportionality in that he  approached
      this as a weak claim being under a misapprehension of the true  length
      of the children's residence here. Mr Coleman also submitted  that  the
      findings on best interests of the children were unsustainable  because
      they were based on a factual error.

  19.       I have considered this submission carefully as the lives of four
      very young children are involved and  they  are  not  responsible  for
      their mother's deception. However, having considered the determination
      as a whole and all the reasons  set  out  for  the  rejection  of  the
      Article 8 claim, I do not share the view that this is such an error as
      to render the  determination  unsustainable.  The  children  are  very
      young. The judge rightly concluded that their best interests  were  to
      be brought up by their parents which they would be even if returned to
      Nigeria. That assessment is sustainable  regardless  of  whether  they
      lived longer here than in Nigeria.  As  found  in  EA  (op  cit)  "the
      correct starting point in considering the welfare and  best  interests
      of a young child would be that it is in  the  best  interests  of  the
      child to live with and be brought up by his or her parents, subject to
      any very strong contra-indication".  No  contra-indications  were  put
      forward to the judge in this case.  He  correctly  took  this  as  his
      starting point.  It is  not  suggested  for  the  appellant  that  the
      children's best interests lie elsewhere.

  20.       EA also addresses the relevance and impact of long residence. It
      is stated that: "Absent other factors, the  reason  why  a  period  of
      substantial residence as a child may become a weighty consideration in
      the balance of competing considerations is that in the course of  such
      time  roots  are  put  down,  personal   identities   are   developed,
      friendships are formed and links are made with the  community  outside
      the family unit. The degree to which these elements  of  private  life
      are forged and therefore the weight to be given to the passage of time
      will depend upon the facts in each case".

  21.       In the present case no evidence of  links  with  the  community,
      ties formed outside the family unit or other indication of integration
      was submitted. The only evidence the judge had  with  respect  to  the
      children was confirmation they attended school  since  November  2007,
      January 2008, January 2009 and January 2012 respectively. He took this
      into account (paragraphs 8 and 27). No doubt the children have friends
      at school and possibly outside school too  however  their  very  young
      ages mean that their  family  unit  is  pivotal  in  their  lives.  EA
      acknowledges that fact. Headnote (iii) observes that "during a child's
      very early years, he or she will be primarily focused on self and  the
      caring  parents  or  guardian".  Mr  Coleman  himself  in  submissions
      acknowledged that the younger years of a  child's  life  were  not  as
      important or formative as later years (see paragraph 8 above). None of
      the children have spent anywhere close to seven years here; the period
      thought to be a determinative stage when  assessing  the  position  of
      children. They are all young. With the support of  their  family  they
      would adapt. The judge was entitled to find as such.

  22.       The judge further found that the appellant and her  husband  had
      very large extended families in Nigeria to provide help and support on
      any readjustment that would need to take  place.  The  children  would
      have their grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins as  well  as  their
      parents. The appellant owns no property here and  the  judge  did  not
      accept that she had given up her home in Nigeria when she  came  here.
      He noted that she and her husband had both worked in  Nigeria,  indeed
      having had better jobs, and would be able to find employment again. He
      found that the children would be able to continue their  education  in
      Nigeria.  He  found  that  the  appellant's  private  life  here   was
      established at a time when she was aware that she  had  misrepresented
      her position to obtain leave.  There  were  no  health,  religious  or
      linguistic issues put forward. The family are all Nigerians  nationals
      and as such would be able  to  enjoy  the  benefits  such  citizenship
      confers. They would be able to enjoy their own culture and traditions.
      It is not  suggested  the  children  would  be  unable  to  obtain  an
      education in Nigeria. There was no other evidence of ties  here  apart
      from family life within the family which would continue after removal.
      It is difficult to  see  what  other  factors  the  judge  could  have
      considered. The period of residence alone does not override everything
      else and in the absence of any particular factors to show  integration
      or adverse impact (none having been  raised)  I  cannot  see  how  the
      judge's error can be said to be material.  There  is  nothing  in  the
      determination to support the contention that the judge approached  the
      Article 8 as being a weak one.  He took all the  factors  argued  into
      account and concluded that the circumstances of this family  were  not
      such that removal should be found to be disproportionate.

  23.       Mr Coleman submitted that the judge  was  wrong  to  punish  the
      children  for  their  mother's   conduct   when   holding   that   her
      misrepresentation was a weighty factor in the balancing  exercise.  It
      is noteworthy that the judge did not reach his assessment of the  best
      interests of the children with that factor in mind. His assessment  of
      the family circumstances is fairly undertaken. The appellant's conduct
      is of course a relevant factor and has to be  given  due  weight.  The
      poor immigration history of the appellant in MK was also given  weight
      despite the presence of children (paragraph  62).  Where,  as  in  the
      present case, an appellant makes false  representations  in  order  to
      remain here, she must take responsibility for the consequences.

  24.       In conclusion, despite Mr Coleman's able submissions  I  do  not
      find that the determination is flawed to the extent that it should  be
      set aside.

Decision

  25.       The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  error  of  law.  The
      decision to dismiss the appeal on immigration and Article 8 grounds is
      maintained.
