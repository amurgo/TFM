                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is an appeal brought by the Entry  Clearance  Officer  against
         the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lowe whose  determination
         was promulgated on 16 December 2014 allowing  Ms  DeMarsh's  appeal
         against the decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer  refusing  her
         leave to enter the United Kingdom. For the sake  of  continuity,  I
         shall refer to Ms Marsh as 'the appellant', as she was in the First-
         tier Tribunal.

      2. The appellant is a citizen of Canada who  was  born  on  2  October
         1985. She sought entry clearance to enter the United Kingdom as the
         partner of Mr Howells, a British citizen then  working  in  Canada.
         Her application was made on 12 June 2014.  It was her intention  to
         accompany him on return. By a decision made on 15 August 2014,  the
         application was refused. The Entry Clearance Officer  recited  that
         Mr Howells had been employed as a  bartender  in  Canada  since  10
         March 2014 earning  an  equivalent  salary  of  �9,940  per  annum.
         Given the period between 10 March 2014  and  12  June  2014  was  a
         period of approximately 3 months, this would equate  with  earnings
         of about �2,490. Prior to that he stated that he had been  employed
         with Great Plains Drilling for  a  period  of  two  months  from  9
         October 2013 to December 2013 showing gross  earnings  of  Canadian
         $13,314. However, the appellant provided evidence that  Mr  Howells
         had been offered employment in the United Kingdom as a teacher with
         a start date on 1 September 2014 at an annual salary of �26,465.

      3. The basis for the refusal was expressed to be a failure to  provide
         mandatory documents confirming Mr Howells' employment. However, the
         decision also refers to the financial  requirements  when  overseas
         employment  is  relied  upon  in  support  of  an  entry  clearance
         application.  Those  requirements  were  to  be  satisfied  by  the
         provision of personal bank statements and payslips.  In particular,
         the payslips had to cover a period of six months prior to the  date
         of application (12 December 2013 to 12 June 2014) if the individual
         has been employed for at least  six  months  or  alternatively  any
         period of salaried employment in the period of 12 months  prior  to
         the date of application (12 June 2013  to  12  June  2014)  if  the
         person had been employed by his  current  employer  less  than  six
         months.

      4. The decision letter, however, did not go on to specify the level of
         remuneration that Mr Howells was required to meet.

      5. The applicant submitted a tax return for the year  2013  confirming
         his  remuneration  in  Canadian  dollars  at   an   equivalent   of
         �12,878.40.

      6. When the matter came before me for hearing on 20 April 2015, I  was
         concerned to know where the requirements of the Rules  were  to  be
         found and how the respondent alleged Mr Howells had failed to  meet
         them.  I directed:

          1. The respondent* has 14 days (i) to set out the applicable
             Immigration Rules (ii) to identify the evidence submitted to
             the Entry Clearance Officer and (iii) to set out how it is
             said the respondent failed to meet the requirements of the
             Rules (the refusal letter fails to do this)

          2. The respondent has liberty to respond, if she chooses to do
             so, within 14 days.

          3. The papers are to be placed before me in 28 days to determine
             the appeal on the papers without a hearing.

      7. As my record of  proceedings  made  clear,  the  reference  to  the
         respondent* in paragraph 1 is a reference to  the  Entry  Clearance
         Officer who is the appellant in this appeal.

      8. Pursuant to my directions, and within time, Mr  Melvin  filed  with
         the Tribunal and served  upon  the  sponsor's  brother  a  document
         setting out the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  as  they
         related to entry clearance as the dependent partner  of  a  British
         citizen under Appendix FM. In addition, he submitted a copy of  the
         Immigration Directorate Instructions insofar  as  they  related  to
         Family Members under  Appendix  FM  and  in  particular  Annex  FM,
         Section FM  1.7:  Financial  Requirement.  In  section  5  of  this
         document,  entitled  'Salaried  and  non-salaried  employment'  the
         following sections were highlighted:

         (i)  5.2 Category A:   With current employer for six months or more
             - overseas sponsor returning to the UK

         (ii) 5.4 Category B: Less than six months with current employer  or
             variable income - overseas sponsor returning to the UK

      9. Ms DeMarsh provided no response.

     10. The crucial factor to note is that in each  category,  that  is  in
         either Category A or B, the applicant had  to  meet  the  financial
         requirements which is the minimum income threshold that the partner
         must satisfy. At the time of application and decision the  relevant
         threshold to be met by Mr Howells as a partner with no children was
         �18,600.

     11. It was this crucial figure that was omitted from the decision  made
         by the Entry Clearance Officer. Once this ingredient  is  added  to
         the decision-making process, the  outcome  of  the  appeal  becomes
         clear. In essence, where the applicant's partner was in  employment
         for less than six months with what was then  his  current  employer
         (as a bartender from 10 March 2014 to 12 June 2014)  the  financial
         requirement had to be met in  two  parts.  First,  the  applicant's
         partner had  to  confirm  an  offer  of  salaried  or  non-salaried
         employment and secondly he had to show that he had received in  the
         12 months prior to the date of application a level of income of  no
         less than �18,600.

     12. The  applicant,  as  recorded  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         submitted evidence that between October 2013 and November  2013  he
         had earned Canadian  $13,300  with  Great  Plains  Drilling  and  a
         further sum by working as a bartender from  10  March  2014  at  an
         annual equivalent sterling rate of �9,940.  The combined effect was
         that in the 12 months preceding the application, the applicant  did
         not reach the minimum threshold of �18,600 however  generously  one
         viewed the documentation.

     13. It is regrettable that the Entry Clearance Officer failed  to  make
         clear where the application failed. It is also regrettable  that  I
         found the Rules so impenetrable that I was  unable  to  apply  them
         unaided. However, now that the position has been made clear to me I
         am satisfied that the application made by the appellant  was  bound
         to fail because her partner did not meet the financial requirements
         which would have  enabled  her  to  obtain  entry  clearance  as  a
         partner.

     14. When the matter came before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Lowe,  she
         allowed Ms DeMarsh's appeal on the basis that the  application  for
         entry clearance only required it to be established that  the  offer
         of UK employment met the threshold rate set out in  the  Rules.  In
         doing so she failed to apply the provisions of the Rules as  I  now
         understand them to be (and, for reasons similar to  mine,  she  may
         have misunderstood those requirements). As the First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge recorded the 2013 tax return confirmed Mr  Howells'  earnings
         at about �12,878.40, or their equivalent in Canadian  dollars,  had
         the Judge applied the correct  requirement,  she  would  have  been
         bound to have dismissed the appeal.

     15. It is apparent that the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer was
         incomplete in that it failed to set out in  intelligible  form  the
         reasons for refusal. It would normally be appropriate to set  aside
         the decision and require the Entry  Clearance  Officer  to  make  a
         fresh and lawful one. However, as there is no discretionary element
         involved and as I now understand the basis for refusal, there is no
         advantage to be gained by requiring the Entry Clearance Officer  to
         perfect his decision by making a lawful one. I now know  what  that
         decision must be. Accordingly, I am in as good a position as he  to
         set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge and  remake
         the decision dismissing Ms DeMarsh's appeal.

DECISION

    1.   The Judge made an error on a point of law and I allow the Entry
         Clearance Officer's appeal.

    2.   I set aside the decision of Judge Lowe.

    3.   I re-make the decision dismissing Ms DeMarsh's appeal on all the
         grounds advanced.
