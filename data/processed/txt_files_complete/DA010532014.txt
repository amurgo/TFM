For the Respondent:    In person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Turnock made following a hearing at Bradford on 19th November 2014.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of the Czech  Republic  born  on  25th  July
    1992.  He entered the UK on 1st July 2007 and it is  accepted  that  he
    has acquired a permanent right of residence in the UK.

 3. The claimant was convicted of driving otherwise than in accordance with
    a licence at Sheffield Juvenile Court on 23rd June  2010  and  using  a
    vehicle whilst uninsured.  He was fined ï¿½100 and  his  driving  licence
    was endorsed and he was disqualified.

 4. On 22nd November 2012 he  received  a  caution  from  Kent  Police  for
    forging a document other than a prescription for a scheduled drug.

 5. On 29th July 2013  he  was  convicted  of  conspiring  to  steal  motor
    vehicles and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 30 months.  In
    his sentencing remarks the judge said that it was accepted that he  was
    not the prime mover but he had an important  role  to  play  acting  as
    interpreter and recruiter.  He was given credit for his guilty plea.

 6. The judge set out the legal framework including Regulations 19  and  21
    of the 2006 Regulations before considering the evidence  including  the
    circumstances surrounding the index offence.

 7. The claimant's evidence was that he had a mother, aunt and uncle in the
    UK and many cousins living here.  His  stepfather  had  family  in  the
    Czech Republic although he did not really know them and his mother  had
    a sister there but was not in contact with  her.   The  judge  accepted
    that the claimant had substantial family connections in the UK  and  no
    significant family links with the Czech  Republic.   He  was  satisfied
    that there was more support from his immediate family here which  would
    assist with his rehabilitation compared with the  situation  there  and
    that he had undergone a significant degree of training and had  engaged
    with the probation service.  Although the respondent was  of  the  view
    that there was insufficient evidence to  show  that  the  claimant  had
    adequately addressed all of the reasons for his offending behaviour and
    that the completion of offending behaviour programmes could reduce  the
    risk of reoffending in the future the claimant produced at the  hearing
    a number of documents of evidence of courses which  he  had  undertaken
    whilst in custody.

 8. The judge concluded as follows:

         "The  Appellant  produced  a  letter  from  the  National  Offender
         Management Service dated 16 October 2014.  The Appellant  has  been
         supervised by the National Probation Service since his  release  on
         Licence in 24th June 2014.  He has engaged  with  the  service  and
         kept all appointments offered.  The priority areas of work for  the
         National Probation Service are protecting the public  from  serious
         harm and reducing the likelihood of reoffending.  The Appellant has
         been assessed as posing a low risk of serious harm in  relation  to
         public protection and the risk of reoffending tool indicates a  low
         risk of re-offending.  Given the date of that letter I am satisfied
         that the author was aware of all relevant considerations.

         In conclusion the Respondent  considered  that  the  Appellant  had
         committed a serious criminal offence  in  the  United  Kingdom  and
         there is risk that he might reoffend  in  the  future.   Given  the
         threat of serious harm that the Appellant posed to the  public  the
         Respondent considered  that  his  personal  circumstances  did  not
         preclude his deportation being pursued.  The Respondent  considered
         that the decision to deport was  proportionate  and  in  accordance
         with the principles of the EEA Regulations.

         The cases referred  to  above  indicate  that  the  acquisition  of
         permanent residence indicates a substantial degree of  integration.
         In the case of the Appellant it  is  relevant  that  his  immediate
         family are now settled in the UK.  Whilst the subsequent imposition
         of a prison sentence indicates that the  Appellant  has  failed  to
         comply with the values expressed by society I do not consider  that
         it shows he has not  substantially  integrated  into  society  when
         taking into account his  home  and  family  circumstances.   Taking
         account of all the evidence produced, particularly  the  assessment
         from the National Offender Management Service I  conclude  that  it
         had  not  been  established  that  the  conduct  of  the  Appellant
         represented a genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
         affecting one of the fundamental interests of society nor that  his
         removal would be proportionate."

 9. On that basis he allowed the appeal.

The grounds of application

10. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the Tribunal had erred in his assessment that the claimant  was  not  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat.  He had shown that he
    was of a deceptive character given his convictions and continual denial
    of responsibility for his actions.  Any claim that he has rehabilitated
    and is remorseful was not credible.  His offending history  since  2010
    shows that he has not integrated into the UK way of life and his  index
    offence was committed over nearly a period of a year.  He was aware  of
    what he was doing and continued to offend even  when  he  knew  it  was
    illegal.  He now seeks to downplay his involvement and  the  assessment
    that he is a low risk by his offender manager cannot be relied upon  as
    the facts show that he has not reformed and information  given  at  the
    hearing may have changed the assessment.  Given that he  has  shown  he
    has a propensity to reoffend and escalation and seriousness of offences
    he clearly remains a risk of reoffending  and  potential  harm  to  the
    public.   The  evidence  does  not  support  the  Tribunal's  findings.
    Furthermore his  family  have  been  unable  to  exert  any  sufficient
    influence over him and there is no reason to believe that they  can  do
    so now.

11. Second, the Tribunal erred in its assessment  that  his  rehabilitation
    will be prejudiced if deported.  The Tribunal found that he could  live
    an independent life and it was  unclear  why  he  needed  his  family's
    support.  The option remained for them to  return  temporarily  to  the
    Czech Republic to assist him if needed.  It was not plausible that they
    would not be in contact with their family in the Czech Republic and  it
    would not be unreasonable to resume contact with  them.   There  is  no
    evidence that they would be unable to assist.  The claimant  spent  his
    formative years in the Czech Republic and  speaks  the  language  which
    will assist him in his reintegration  and  rehabilitation  there.   The
    fact that there is no evidence of any offending in the  Czech  Republic
    also suggests that his prospects are  better  there  as  his  level  of
    integration is stronger there.  The fact that  he  has  been  offending
    since 2010 clearly shows that he is not integrated into the UK  way  of
    life.

12. Permission to appeal was  initially  refused  by  Judge  Astle  on  6th
    January 2015 but subsequently granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Storey on
    14th April 2015.  Judge Storey  stated  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge had failed to refer to Essa in the Court of Appeal and it did not
    help that he had not explained on what basis he accepted  the  evidence
    about family connections here  and  in  the  Czech  Republic.   He  had
    arguably erred in appearing to accept that the  assessment  of  present
    threat was confined to deciding whether the  author  of  the  probation
    report was aware of all relevant considerations,  taking  into  account
    all relevant matters when assessing the prospects of rehabilitation and
    considering whether his integrative links established by his  permanent
    residence were broken by his criminal offending.

The hearing

13. Mrs Petterson told me that she was without her file because it had gone
    to the wrong hearing centre.  Nevertheless she had  prepared  the  case
    and, with the help of my file, would be in a position  to  present  her
    arguments if allowed enough time to do so.

14. When she returned she frankly accepted that she would be in  difficulty
    because the only letter on the file was that  quoted  in  full  by  the
    Immigration Judge from the National Probation Service.   There  was  no
    other information before him.  Furthermore the  claimant  had  provided
    the certificates of the courses which he had completed whilst in prison
    which were said to have been lacking by the Secretary of State  in  her
    refusal letter.  She accepted that it was difficult to  see  what  else
    the Immigration Judge could have done with the  material  in  front  of
    him.

15. So far as the evidence about his  links  to  the  Czech  Republic  were
    concerned she submitted that the judge's conclusion that  the  claimant
    had no significant family links with the Czech Republic was not  firmly
    based on the evidence, because his  mother  had  a  sister  there,  but
    accepted that  this  would  be  immaterial  if  the  claimant  did  not
    represent  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  to
    society.

Findings and Conclusions

16. The grounds merely re-argue the Secretary of State's case.

17. The only  evidence  before  the  judge  in  relation  to  the  risk  of
    reoffending was that set out in the letter from the National  Probation
    Service dated 16th October 2014.  It is quite clear that  the  claimant
    was assessed as a low risk  of  serious  harm  in  relation  to  public
    protection and a low risk of reoffending.  The grounds set out a series
    of arguments as to why that letter should not be taken at  face  value.
    However,  as  Mrs  Petterson  realistically  accepted,  the  judge  was
    entitled to rely on the opinion of the National  Probation  Service  to
    reach the conclusion that the claimant was not a genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat.

18. So far as the links with the Czech Republic are concerned, the  judge's
    conclusion that the claimant had no significant family links  with  the
    Czech Republic was firmly based on the oral evidence. His decision that
    there was more support from his immediate family  in  the  UK  compared
    with the situation in the Czech Republic is unassailable.

19. The grounds do not establish any misapplication of  the  relevant  law.
    The only evidence before the judge from the National Probation  Service
    was that contained in the letter of October 2014.  He was  entitled  to
    rely on the conclusions  in  that  letter  and  to  conclude  that  the
    Secretary of State had not established that the claimant  falls  within
    Regulation 21(5) and to allow the appeal accordingly.

Notice of Decision

20. The original judge did not err  in  law.   His  decision  stands.   The
    Secretary of State's challenge to his decision is dismissed.
