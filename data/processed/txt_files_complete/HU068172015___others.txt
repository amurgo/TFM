                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants, citizens of Bangladesh, are the wife and  two  children
    of  the  Sponsor  Mr  Mohammed  Shamsul  Hoque,  also  a  national   of
    Bangladesh.  The Appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against
    decisions of the Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) dated 19th  August  2015
    to refuse their applications for entry clearance  as  the  partner  and
    children of the Sponsor under Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    First-tier Tribunal Judge R G Walters  dismissed  the  appeals  on  the
    basis that he was not satisfied that it had been demonstrated that  the
    Sponsor was genuinely earning �24,800 per annum at the  required  time,
    the amount required to meet the financial requirements of  Appendix  FM
    of the Immigration Rules.  The Appellants now appeal with permission to
    this Tribunal.

 2. The Entry Clearance Officer considered the evidence  of  the  Sponsor's
    earnings noting that the  Sponsor  had  been  employed  with  the  same
    employer for the previous three years.  It  was  noted  that  the  bank
    statements show deposits to match the claimed income but within a  week
    the full amount is withdrawn in cash. The ECO was  not  satisfied  that
    the Sponsor's employment and earnings were as claimed.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered the appeal under Article 8  of
    the European Convention on Human  Rights.   The  judge  considered  the
    documentary and oral evidence in relation to  the  Sponsor's  earnings.
    He did not accept  the  Sponsor's  oral  evidence  as  to  his  claimed
    promotion within the company which it was  claimed  accounted  for  the
    increase in pay. The judge did not accept the Sponsor's claim  that  he
    pays his rent and  council  tax  in  cash  in  light  of  the  lack  of
    documentary evidence to support that claim. The judge did  not  believe
    the Sponsor's evidence that he  had  to  withdraw  his  wages  in  cash
    shortly after being paid each month for the purposes  he  claimed.   In
    conclusion the judge did not believe that the  Sponsor  is  in  genuine
    employment earning �24,800 per annum.

Error of Law

 4. In the Grounds of Appeal the Appellants put forward three  grounds.  It
    is contended in the  first  ground  that  the  Appellant  had  met  the
    mandatory requirements of Appendix FM-SE  in  terms  of  the  documents
    submitted and that it was not open to the  judge  to  take  account  of
    other evidence to  disprove  the  level  of  the  Sponsor's  income  or
    genuineness of employment. This ground was not developed or pursued  by
    Ms Sher at the hearing.

 5. At the hearing Ms Sher submitted that the judge's decision  records  at
    paragraph 30 that the Home Office Presenting Officer accepted that  the
    Sponsor had put forward a plausible explanation for  taking  his  wages
    out in cash  to  pay  bills.   She  further  submitted  that  her  note
    indicated that at the hearing the Presenting Officer accepted that  the
    letter from HMRC demonstrated that the Sponsor does work as claimed and
    that he met the financial requirements.

 6. However, no evidence of Ms Sher's note of the hearing was  put  forward
    in the grounds. It is clear from the decision that the judge noted  the
    Presenting Officer accepted that it appeared  a  plausible  explanation
    that the Sponsor had taken his wages out in cash to pay bills but, when
    the judge queried the Presenting Officer's position on  this  issue  as
    noted at paragraph 31, the Presenting Officer replied that he  was  not
    conceding the appeal and was leaving it  up  to  the  court  to  decide
    whether this was a reasonable explanation  [32].   In  the  absence  of
    evidence from Ms Sher in the form of her notes from the hearing and  in
    the absence of this issue being raised in the Grounds of  Appeal  I  do
    not accept that the Presenting Officer conceded the whole  issue  under
    appeal.  As submitted by Mr Nath it may be that the Presenting  Officer
    accepted that it was plausible that the Sponsor took his wages  out  in
    cash to pay bills but this did not deal with the other issues raised by
    the Entry Clearance Officer  including  the  significant  jump  in  the
    Sponsor's claimed earnings over the years  since  2012  when  he  begun
    working for the same employer.  The Entry Clearance Officer pointed  to
    an increase of 381% in earnings from 2012/2013.

 7. First-tier Tribunal Judge Page granted permission on the basis that all
    grounds were arguable noting that the Grounds of  Appeal  raise  issues
    with the calculations made about the Sponsor's total income to meet the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.  At the  hearing  before  me  Ms
    Sher accepted that the Grounds of Appeal did not raise issue  with  the
    judge's calculations.

 8. The judge considered the Sponsor's oral evidence  in  relation  to  his
    positions within the employer's company, his promotions and his claimed
    increases in earnings but noted at paragraph 20 that  the  Sponsor  had
    failed to clarify whether he took up the position of director  and,  if
    so, on what date.  The judge  also  noted  at  paragraph  26  that  the
    Sponsor said that his job  title  was  'tandoori  chef'  but  noted  at
    paragraph 27 that he did not believe that the skills of tandoori  chefs
    could be learned in under a year given that it is a highly skilled  job
    and that up  until  recently  there  was  a  special  Immigration  Rule
    allowing admission of tandoori chefs from the sub-continent.  The judge
    also took into account that the Sponsor did not have  any  certificates
    of his competence as a tandoori chef [28].   It  is  clear  from  these
    paragraphs that the judge did not accept the Sponsor's  evidence  about
    his claimed promotion within the  company  and  increase  in  earnings.
    These conclusions were open to the judge on the evidence before him and
    I note that there  has  been  no  specific  challenge  to  the  judge's
    findings in relation to this issue.

 9. The second Ground of Appeal contends that the  judge  erred  in  making
    adverse credibility findings against the Sponsor on matters  that  were
    not put to him at the oral hearing by the Presenting Officer or by  the
    judge.  It is contended that, had the judge raised  the  issue  of  the
    payment of council tax in cash, the Sponsor would  have  been  able  to
    show evidence of those payments in cash.   It  is  contended  that  the
    judge drew an adverse inference from the fact that the Sponsor had  not
    set up a direct debit on his bank account to pay for  his  council  tax
    but the Sponsor was not asked this question at the hearing and  had  he
    been asked he would have been able to provide the judge  with  evidence
    as to why he prefers to pay his council tax by cash rather than  direct
    debit.  It is contended that the judge made  a  further  error  in  the
    example cited at paragraph 33 of the decision where he noted  that  the
    Sponsor sent �1,092.44 to his wife in Bangladesh on 25th November  2014
    in circumstances where he only had �58.49 in his account on  that  date
    and his next salary of �1,674.03 was not credited to his account  until
    1st December 2014.  The judge concluded that it was a mystery where the
    �1,092.44 came from.  It is argued that the judge failed to have regard
    to the previous page of  the  bank  statement  which  showed  that  the
    Sponsor had withdrawn �1,400 in cash on  10th  November  2014.   It  is
    further  contended  that  the  judge  overlooked  evidence   of   other
    remittances to his wife in Bangladesh.  It is argued  that,  while  the
    Home Office  Presenting  Officer  at  the  hearing  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal stated that he could not concede the appeal [32],  this  is  a
    strong indication by the Respondent that  the  Sponsor's  earnings  and
    employment were genuine and therefore it was materially unfair for  the
    Immigration Judge to go behind the position taken by the Respondent  at
    the hearing.  It is  contended  that  the  judge  made  unfair  adverse
    credibility findings without hearing oral evidence from the Sponsor and
    without giving the Sponsor an opportunity to respond to those  matters.
    It is contended that this resulted  in  unfairness  from  a  procedural
    irregularity.

10. Ms Sher submitted that the  Sponsor  provided  an  explanation  at  the
    hearing as to why he paid bills in cash and about sending money to  his
    wife and children in Bangladesh including the provision  of  remittance
    receipts.  Ms Sher referred to the evidence in the  Appellants'  bundle
    showing various  remittances  to  the  Appellant  in  Bangladesh.   She
    submitted that this significant evidence of remittances  would  explain
    why the Sponsor was sending money to the Appellant from money withdrawn
    after he was being paid.

11. The judge addressed the issue of the Sponsor paying for  his  rent  and
    council tax in cash.  At paragraphs 29 and 34 the judge noted that  the
    Appellant produced two council tax bills but neither  of  these  was  a
    receipt and was not therefore evidence that  the  bills  were  paid  in
    cash.  Although Ms Sher submitted that the backs of these forms  showed
    that the Sponsor paid for his council  tax  in  cash,  the  Appellants'
    First-tier Tribunal bundle before me shows  only  the  front  of  those
    council tax bills and does not provide evidence that these  bills  were
    paid for in cash.  The judge also noted that the Sponsor  had  produced
    no evidence such as a rent book to show that he pays his rent in  cash.
    There is no challenge to this conclusion.  The judge noted  that  there
    was no reason given why the Sponsor had not set up a  direct  debit  in
    his bank account to  pay  for  his  council  tax  bills.   The  grounds
    complain that these issues should have been put to the Sponsor, however
    it is very clear from reading  the  decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer that it was not believed that the Sponsor genuinely earned  the
    amount claimed and his claim to  withdraw  his  earnings  in  cash  was
    questioned in the Entry Clearance Officer's decision.  Therefore, these
    issues were very much in issue before the First-tier Tribunal Judge and
    I do not accept that the judge has to put  every  point  based  on  the
    evidence to the Sponsor when the Sponsor was  aware  of  all  of  these
    issues.

12. At paragraph 33 the judge  said:  "I  did  not  believe  the  Sponsor's
    evidence that he had to withdraw his wages in cash shortly after  being
    paid each month for the purposes previously mentioned".  The judge said
    that the Sponsor  produced  various  remittance  advices  and  gave  an
    example of one dated 25th November 2014 showing  a  remittance  to  his
    wife and notes that on that date the Sponsor only  had  �58.49  in  his
    account and his salary was  not  credited  to  his  account  until  1st
    December 2014.  In the Grounds of Appeal the Appellants  complain  that
    the judge failed to take account of the fact that the Sponsor  withdrew
    �1,400 in cash on 10th November  2014.   However  that  was  two  weeks
    before the transfer on 25th November 2014 and  it  is  not  immediately
    apparent that there is any link between the withdrawal on 10th November
    and the transfer on 25th November.  Whilst it  is  contended  that  the
    judge overlooked evidence of other remittances to the Sponsor's wife it
    is clear from paragraph 33 that the judge gave that as an example only.
    Although Ms Sher pointed to a number of remittances  it  is  not  clear
    that there is any direct link in terms of amount and timing between the
    amounts withdrawn by the Sponsor from his account and the sums remitted
    to Bangladesh.

13. The Appellants' third ground contends that the Immigration Judge failed
    to take into consideration or make reference to the letter from HMRC at
    page 6-7 of the Appellants' bundle.  It is argued that this letter  was
    material in that it demonstrates that the Sponsor is in  employment  as
    stated, that his earnings satisfy the requirements of Appendix  FM  and
    that he was paying income tax in his lawful employment. At the  hearing
    Ms Sher submitted that the letter from  HMRC  shows  that  the  Sponsor
    earned the required amount in the financial year up to  2016.   However
    it is clear from the decision that the judge was aware that the Sponsor
    was apparently being paid the wages claimed but did not believe that he
    is genuinely earning the amount claimed because he did not believe  the
    Sponsor's explanations for the significant jump in his earnings between
    2013 and 2015/16 nor did he  believe  the  Sponsor's  explanations  for
    withdrawing his earnings in cash as soon as  they  are  paid  into  his
    account. These conclusions were open  to  the  judge  on  the  evidence
    before him.

14. The judge concluded at paragraph 35 that he did not  believe  that  the
    Sponsor is in genuine employment earning �24,800 per annum. In my view,
    in light of the credibility findings in relation to the Sponsor's  oral
    evidence and the findings made in relation to the documentary evidence,
    this conclusion was open to the judge on the basis of the  findings  on
    the evidence before him.
