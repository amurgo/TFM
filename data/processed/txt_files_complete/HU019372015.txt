Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Lloyd dismissing his appeal against the refusal of an  application  for
    entry clearance to settle in the UK as the adult dependent relative and
    family member of his father  Mr  Limbu,  an  ex-Ghurkha  soldier.   The
    Appellant appealed against that decision and was granted permission  to
    appeal by Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Sutherland  Williams  in  the
    following terms:

         "Permission to appeal is granted, as  the  two  grounds  of  appeal
         identify arguable errors of law, in particular  with  reference  to
         family life.

         I do not at this stage prefer to say anything further about the two
         grounds  identified,  or  the  further  argument  in  relation   to
         proportionality.  These matters will be for the  Judge  determining
         this onwards appeal to decide".

 2. I was provided with a detailed Rule 24  response  from  the  Respondent
    which indicated that the appeal was resisted.

Error of Law

 3. At the close of the hearing I reserved my decision which  I  shall  now
    give.  I do find that there are errors of law in the decision such that
    it should be set aside.  My reasons for so finding are as follows.

 4. Noting the Grounds of Appeal, they may be summarised as follows:

      i) a failure to apply the correct test for family life between  adults
         in light of the jurisprudence  concerning  the  historic  injustice
         metered out to Ghurkhas and their families;

     ii) a failure to apply the binding jurisprudence  against  the  factual
         matrix of the Appellant's family life with  his  mother  and  their
         cohabitation;

    iii) materiality of error in relation to proportionality.

 5. Looking at ground 1 against the Rule  24  response,  I  find  that  the
    Secretary of State is unable to defend the  judge's  decision  in  this
    regard.  Whilst the findings  from  ��50  to  62  of  the  decision  do
    consider the engagement of family life, and whilst the judge notes  the
    binding authority of Rai v Entry Clearance Officer,  New  Delhi  [2017]
    EWCA Civ 320, the judge fails to note and apply  the  binding  approach
    that should be followed in respect of Gurkha cases in  particular  from
    �52 onwards and the conclusion that, that there was family life between
    the Appellant and his parents at the time of separation in 2006 but not
    in the ensuing years, is materially flawed.  This is  because  pursuant
    to [17] of Lord Justice Lindblom's decision in Rai (citation supra), it
    is made plain that the proper approach is to search for support that is
    either real, committed or effective (pursuant to [17] of  Lord  Justice
    Sedley's judgment in  Kugathas  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2003] EWCA Civ 31) which represents the irreducible minimum
    of what family life between adults requires.  It  is  in  this  respect
    that there must therefore be more than normal emotional ties.  However,
    it is also worth noting the later decision in Patel and Others v  Entry
    Clearance Officer, Mumbai [2010]  EWCA  Civ  17  wherein  Lord  Justice
    Sedley, at [14] of his judgment, stated as follows:

         "You can set out to compensate for  a  historical  wrong,  but  you
         cannot reverse the passage of time.  Many of  these  children  have
         now grown up and embarked on lives of their own.   Where  this  has
         happened, the bonds which constitute family life will no longer  be
         there, and art. 8 will have no purchase.  But what  may  constitute
         an  extant  family  life  falls  well  short  of  what  constitutes
         dependency, and a good many adult children - including children  on
         whom the parents themselves are now reliant  -  may  still  have  a
         family life with parents who are now settled here not by  leave  or
         by force of circumstance but by long-delayed right.  That  is  what
         gives the historical wrong a potential relevance to art.  8  claims
         such as these.  It does not make the  Convention  a  mechanism  for
         turning the clock back, but it does make both the history  and  its
         admitted injustices potentially relevant to the application of art.
         8(2)."

 6. In light of the decisions in Kugathas and Patel it is plain  that  what
    may  constitute  an  extant  and  family  life  falls  short  of   what
    constitutes dependency, and as such, even if the judge  were  right  in
    respect of the Appellant not being dependent  'by  necessity'  but  'by
    choice', this is not a preclusion to family life being engaged  between
    an adult family member (such as  a  child)  and  another  adult  family
    member (such as  a  parent)  where  such  dependency  exists  and  thus
    demonstrates support that is either real, committed  or  effective.   I
    find that there is no basis  in  jurisprudence  for  the  finding  that
    family life being engaged in respect of Article 8  requires  dependency
    'by necessity' rather than 'by choice', or  any  other  form  for  that
    matter.   Consequently,  I  find  that  the  decision  is   flawed   in
    discounting family life for the reasons given.

 7. As the Rule 24 response from the Secretary of State notes at ��6 and 7,
    as observed by Sir Stanley Burnton in Singh v Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 630 at [24] of his judgment,  these
    cases "all depend on the facts" and 'love  and  affection'  between  an
    adult and his parents or siblings will not of itself justify a  finding
    of family life, as there has to be "something more".  In this scenario,
    albeit the appellant is a young adult living separately to his parents,
    it cannot be said that he is living independently of them and  in  fact
    he gives every appearance of being dependent upon them, and as  such  I
    find that the assessment of whether family life was engaged between the
    Appellant and his parents to be fatally flawed.

 8. Turning to Ground 2, I note that the Appellant has  not  established  a
    family life of his own, albeit that he may have social ties  in  Nepal.
    In this regard, I find that he is still capable of forming family  life
    with his parents (see AA v the United Kingdom [2012] Imm AR 1 at  [49],
    as approved in the case of Gurung at [46]).  As a result, I  find  that
    there is a flaw in the First-tier Tribunal Judge's assessment that  the
    cohabitation between the Appellant and his mother counts for  'nothing'
    because the mother has "the best of both worlds".  I cannot  understand
    how the mother's predicament could rationally be described  in  such  a
    manner as it would be a less than perfect scenario for a mother  to  be
    parted from her dependent son, no matter if he  is  an  adult  or  not.
    Indeed, the fact that the mother is being compelled to spend time  with
    her son may also be evidence of the  fact  that  there  are  more  than
    normal emotional ties given that she normally  resides  in  the  United
    Kingdom with her husband, an ex-Gurkha soldier, and it  is  not  normal
    for a mother to be comelled to travel  internationally  to  spend  time
    with her adult son.  I further find that such a finding fails  to  have
    regard to the practical and  logistical  difficulties  that  have  been
    created by the historic injustice meted out  to  Gurkha  families.   As
    such, in my view, it does not matter whether the Appellant  was  living
    with his family or not, or whether the  dependency  was  by  choice  or
    necessity, as family  life  can  exist  between  adults  regardless  of
    whether they  are  living  together  or  not  in  the  same  home,  and
    regardless of whether there is support by means of choice or necessity,
    as all that matters is the fact of whether there is any  dependency  or
    support at all.

 9. Turning to the final ground regarding  proportionality  (which  I  have
    summarised under point 3 above), had the First-tier  Tribunal  assessed
    the engagement of Article 8(2) properly it would have been  clear  that
    the minimum  required  to  demonstrate  family  life  was  enjoyed  was
    arguably made out against the factual matrix before it, and this  would
    have had a material impact upon the outcome of the appeal.

10. Consequently, I find that there are  material  errors  of  law  in  the
    decision such that it should be set aside in its entirety.

Notice of Decision

11. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside in  its  entirety.
    This matter is to be remitted to be heard by a differently  constituted
    bench.

Directions

13. This matter is to be remitted to IAC Newport, Columbus House.

14. A Nepali interpreter is required.

15. I am told that there may be four witness who will  be  called  to  give
    evidence.

16. The time estimate for this appeal is three hours.

17. No special directions have been sought and I do not see any  reason  to
    give any.

18. No anonymity direction has been requested and I do not see  any  reason
    why one should be given now.

19. Given that this will be the third time that the First-tier Tribunal  is
    to hear this matter I remit this case for the specific attention of the
    Resident Judge at IAC Newport, so that it may be listed before the most
    appropriate member of that Tribunal centre.
