                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica and  he  was  born  on  12  March
    1984.  He made an application for leave to remain which was refused  by
    the Secretary of State  in  a  decision  of  25  September  2015.   The
    appellant appealed against this decision and his appeal  was  dismissed
    by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Fletcher-Hill following  a  hearing
    at Hatton Cross on 15 July 2016.  The decision  was  promulgated  on  5
    August  2016.   The  appellant  appealed  against  that  decision   and
    permission was granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge  Chapman  on  26
    February 2017. The matter came before me on 24 April 2017.

2.   Permission was  granted  on  a  limited  basis  as  set  out  in  Judge
    Chapman's decision at paragraph 3 and it is on this basis that I  heard
    submissions from the parties (in the absence of any challenge to  Judge
    Chapman's decision).

3.   The appellant's appeal  rested  on  his  relationship  with  a  British
    citizen and their two children. The grounds of appeal and the grant  of
    permission  related  to  the  judge's  decision  in  respect   of   the
    appellant's relationship with his children. The judge  in  relation  to
    this issue made findings at paragraphs 62 to 73:

         "62. There is absolutely no reliable evidence of continued  contact
             with the children other than a variety of photographs of small
             children which,  in  the  tribunal's  bundle,  are  illegible.
             Given that these children were born  in  2011  and  2013  they
             would now be 5 and 2 years old and had they been in contact it
             would be normal to expect there to be letters, cards, pictures
             drawn at school or nursery and given to their father.  No such
             evidence of contact was before the tribunal.  In fact there is
             no credible evidence that he has continued to play any part in
             their lives in recent years.  Indeed, his own evidence is that
             he lives 40 miles away from his girlfriend, Hayley, living  in
             Chelsea  in  London  with  his  aunt  whereas,  she  lives  in
             Dunstable,  Bedfordshire,  close  to  her  own  parents.   His
             evidence is that he travels by train  to  visit  when  he  can
             afford it and that now and again, every 2 to 3 weeks, when  he
             is in the area he takes his 5-year old to school.

         63.  Whether he is in the UK or in Jamaica he will be able to  keep
             in contact with them by modern means of communication if  they
             choose to contact him.

         64.  I find that although the appellant has been in the UK since at
             least 2003, the only leave he has been  granted  was  in  June
             2003 for a period of 16 months and was leave as a student.

         65.  I find that the leave previously granted  expired  in  October
             2004 and the refusal to grant an extension was made on 7 March
             2005.

         66.  I do not find that this appellant has a genuine and subsisting
             relationship with his British children.  I find  that  he  has
             never lived with them as a family unit.

         67.  I find that EV Philippines at paragraph 32 makes it clear that
             the best interests of children should  be  determined  without
             considering their parents and that in  the  current  case  the
             parents have never lived together as a couple and the children
             continue to be cared for by their mother as they  always  have
             been.

         68.  I find that both of the children affected by  this  case  live
             with their mother  and  always  have  done  so  and  that  the
             appellant's involvement in their lives is much less and always
             has been.

         69.  I find that, on the one hand, the appellant and his girlfriend
             have sought to portray themselves as  fiancï¿½s,  and  yet  both
             also acknowledge that they will  not  marry  unless  they  can
             afford to do so.  At present, and indeed at least for the last
             3 years they live 40 miles apart as the appellant  lives  with
             his aunt in Chelsea in London and visits from time to time.

         70.  I find that it is in the best interests of both  the  children
             to remain living with their mother as they  always  have  done
             and in terms of  the  appellant,  he  has  failed  to  provide
             sufficient independent proof of  any  contact  and  continuing
             active role in the lives of his  children  with  whom  he  has
             never shared family life.

         71.  It is trite law that the best interests of a child or children
             are a primary but not a paramount  consideration  as  per  the
             reasoning in ZH (Tanzania).

         72.  I have reminded myself of the five step approach  set  out  by
             the late Lord Bingham in Razgar v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27 and  his
             approach to Article 8 claims in  Huang  and  Kashmiri  v  SSHD
             [2007] UKHL 11 and  that  he  approved  this  approach  in  EB
             (Kosovo) v SSHD [2008] UKHL 41.

         73.  I find that there are  no  good  grounds  for  permitting  the
             appellant  to  stay  in  the  United   Kingdom   outside   the
             Immigration Rules and that the only compelling circumstance on
             which he can rely is the fact that his children have been born
             in the UK and are British citizens.  He has never lived  in  a
             family unit with the mother of the British citizens."

4.   The judge erred in law because she did not give  adequate  reasons  why
    she did not accept the evidence of the appellant's partner and two live
    witnesses  (Ms  Marilyn  Reed  and  Laura  Brown)  in  respect  of  the
    appellant's relationship with his children.  The judge at paragraph  37
    recorded that evidence was given by two other  witnesses  but  did  not
    identify them by name.  At  paragraph  62  she  found  that  there  was
    "absolutely no reliable evidence of continued contact with the children
    other than a variety of photographs of small  children  which,  in  the
    Tribunal's bundle are illegible." However, there  are  no  findings  of
    fact in relation to the evidence of the  two  live  witnesses  and  the
    witness statements from various friends and family that  are  contained
    in the appellant's bundle.

5.   The judge made reference to the photographs in  the  Tribunal's  bundle
    which were illegible. Whilst this was the  case,  she  had  before  her
    legible copies provided by the appellant at the hearing.  It  is  clear
    from  paragraph  62  that  she  saw  legible  photographs  because  she
    described them as showing children.  The  appellant's  partner  in  her
    witness statement references the photographs and her evidence  is  that
    some are up to date.  It is not apparent from the judge's findings  why
    this evidence was not accepted or indeed whether the judge took it into
    account when she concluded that  there  was  no  reliable  evidence  of
    continued contact.

6.   There was a letter from the  children's  school  at  page  185  of  the
    appellant's bundle dated 16 June 2015 which is not written in the  past
    tense and which clearly identifies the appellant as the father.  It  is
    not clear from the decision of the judge that she took this letter into
    account because she commented only  on  the  problems  with  the  first
    letter from the school at page 184  of  the  appellant's  bundle.   The
    judge stated at paragraph 62 that there is no  credible  evidence  that
    the appellant has continued to play any part in the children's lives in
    recent years. This is a finding that  may  be  open  to  her,  but  the
    decision is inadequately reasoned in the light of the  evidence  before
    her.

7.   The error is material and infects the wider Article 8 assessment and  I
    set aside the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the
    appellant's appeal.  Having set aside the decision I am not constrained
    within the parameters of the grant of permission. It  is  clear  to  me
    that  the  decision  of  the  judge  in  relation  to  the  appellant's
    relationship with his partner is not sustainable  as  a  result  of  my
    decision and that the decision in its entirety is set aside.

8.     The parties did not submit further evidence in  compliance  with  the
    directions of the Tribunal.  The appellant's  representative  requested
    the matter be remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  rehearing.
    Whilst accepting that there had been non-compliance with directions she
    argued that it is in the children's best interests  for  the  court  to
    have up to date evidence and Mr Melvin agreed with this.

9.       I accepted the submissions made in respect  of  venue.  The  appeal
    must be heard afresh which  will  involve  an  extensive  fact  finding
    exercise.  None of the findings of the FtT are maintained.

10.  I explained at the hearing that it is essential that the  Tribunal  has
    up to date evidence relating to the children in order to make a  proper
    best interests assessment.  The  Appellant,  his  family,  Counsel  and
    solicitor were all present at the hearing before me.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT to dismiss the appeal is set aside.   The matter  is
remitted to the First-tier to be heard afresh.
