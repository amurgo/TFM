                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr D Chirico, instructed by Jein Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms L Kenny, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269), I make an anonymity  direction.  Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings
    or any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly
    identify the appellant(s).

 2. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Widdup  promulgated  16.5.17,  dismissing  his  appeal
    against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State,  dated  17.3.15,  to
    refuse his claim for international protection made on 21.6.13.

 3. This matter was previously heard by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  Bagral
    on 19.7.17 and 20.7.18. However, it was listed  before  me  on  12.4.19
    pursuant to the transfer order of Principal  Resident  Judge  O'Connor,
    dated 8.3.19. Neither party was ready for a substantive hearing  having
    misunderstood that it was to be a de novo hearing of the appeal.

 4. Having heard both parties on the unfortunate history of this appeal and
    on both parties agreeing that remittal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  as
    the best way of proceeding, I remit this appeal to  be  heard  de  novo
    before the First-tier Tribunal sitting at Taylor House. New bundles and
    further  evidence  will  be  required  and,  in  particular,  has  been
    indicated that  evidence  will  be  adduced  to  demonstrate  that  the
    appellant is now not fit to give evidence. For that  purpose,  he  will
    rely on the oral evidence he gave before Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Bagral on 20.7.18.

 5. I remit this matter on the basis  that  this  is  a  case  which  falls
    squarely within the Senior President's Practice Statement at  paragraph
    7.2. The nature or  extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
    necessary for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is  such  that,
    having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with  cases
    fairly and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I  find  that
    it is appropriate to remit this appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.
