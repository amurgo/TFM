Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Mr Nana Agyeman Aning, the Sponsor

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The Entry Clearance Officer Accra appeals to this Tribunal against  the
    determination of Judge Troup in the First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the
    appeal of the respondent, who we shall call "the  claimant"  against  a
    decision on 26 November 2012 refusing her entry clearance with  a  view
    to settlement in the United Kingdom.

2.   The claimant was just under 18 at the date  of  her  application  on  6
    August 2012; she was therefore entitled,  under  paragraph  27  of  the
    Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules, HC395 to  be  treated  as  a
    minor  throughout  the  application  process.   The  sponsor   is   the
    claimant's father.  He lives in the United Kingdom with his partner and
    their two young daughters.  The claimant's mother lives and proposes to
    continue to live in Ghana.  By the time  the  matter  came  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge, the only issue  in  doubt  was  whether  the
    sponsor's funds were sufficient adequately to maintain the claimant and
    the rest of his family.

3.    The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  made  calculations  based   on   his
    perception of the evidence and of the relevant  benefits  levels  which
    would be available to a similar family (including the claimant)  wholly
    reliant on benefits.  Unfortunately, however, he made  at  least  three
    errors.  He took the sponsor's salary from the wrong year; he  took  it
    gross instead of nett; and he failed  to  account  for  the  additional
    entitlement to child benefit which would arise if a further child lived
    with the sponsor.

4.   For those reasons it is clear that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  erred
    in law.  We set his determination aside.

5.   A further error apparently made by the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  was
    that he assessed the claimant's application by the wrong rules.  As  Mr
    Richards explained to us, because of the date of the  application,  the
    decision fell to be made under the provisions of  Appendix  FM  to  the
    Immigration Rules.  The financial  requirements  were  therefore  those
    contained in paragraph E-LTRP 3.1, requiring a specified  gross  annual
    income of at least �18,600, with an additional  �3,800  for  the  first
    child and an additional �2,400  for  each  additional  child.   In  the
    claimant's case that required her to show that the sponsor had a  gross
    income of at least �27,200.  The sponsor's income in the year including
    the date of the decision was not quite as high as it had  been  in  the
    previous year, but there is no  doubt  that  it  was  �28,911.79.   The
    claimant  is  a  person  who  therefore  appears  to  benefit  by   the
    introduction of Appendix FM: certainly, there  is  no  doubt  that  the
    financial requirements of the relevant Rules were met at  the  date  of
    the decision.

6.   Having  set  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  aside,  therefore,  we
    substitute our decision allowing the claimant's appeal.
