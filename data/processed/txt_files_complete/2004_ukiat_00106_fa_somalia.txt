Representation:

For the Appellant      Dr M Abraham, Counsel instructed by Mangala &
Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr J Morris, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The Appellant, a citizen  of  Somalia,  appeals  with  leave  of  the
    Tribunal against the determination of an Adjudicator (Mrs C  M  Horden-
    Beal) dismissing her appeal against the decision of the Respondent made
    on 3 May 2003 to refuse her asylum and leave to remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

2.    The basis of the Appellant's claim was that  she  feared  persecution
    because she was from the Bajuni clan,  and  also  sought  international
    protection to allow her to stay in the United Kingdom and care for  her
    sister's children.

3.    She claimed that she was born in Kismayo in  Somalia  on  19  October
    1975 to Somalian parents.  She left Somalia at the age of 6 and went to
    live in Kenya with one of her father's  Somali  relatives  who  had  no
    children of her own who had asked if she  could  raise  the  Appellant.
    She lived with this lady whom she called aunty and  her  husband  until
    she came to the United Kingdom in January 2003 to care  for  her  dying
    sister.  She had no contact with her sister who had remained in Somalia
    or with her sister's children until her sister sent  an  agent  to  the
    Bajuni community in Mombassa to find her and take her to the UK to care
    for her.  Her sister died within a week of the Appellant's  arrival  in
    the United Kingdom and the Appellant claimed that she had  been  caring
    for her late sister's two children ever since with the help and support
    of Coventry Social Services.

4.    Her sister came to the United Kingdom five years ago with her  eldest
    child Zeyana.  She was granted indefinite leave  to  remain  and  since
    then her youngest child, Barke was born.  At  the  hearing  before  the
    Tribunal, Counsel showed us British passports for the two children.

5.    The Adjudicator accepted that the Appellant is from  Somalia  and  is
    from the  Bajuni  tribe.   She  was  however  not  satisfied  from  the
    objective  evidence  that  persecution  based  upon   the   Appellant's
    ethnicity alone is now very unlikely in Somalia.  On the facts  of  the
    case, she did not find that the Appellant has a  well-founded  fear  of
    persecution based upon her ethnicity.

6.    The Adjudicator then went on to dismiss the Appellant's appeal  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR.

7.    When granting leave to appeal, Mr Moulden, Vice  President,  said  it
    was arguable that the Appellant is entitled to  succeed  on  Article  3
    grounds if not on Refugee Convention grounds as  well  because  of  the
    Adjudicator's finding that she is a  Somali  citizen  of  the  minority
    Bajuni tribe or clan.  It was also arguable that the claimant does have
    a family life in the United Kingdom with her late sister's children for
    whom she now appears to be the only carer.  Her late  sister  had  been
    granted ILR and presumably the children in line with her.   As  already
    indicated above, the two children are now British citizens.

8.    Mr Morris conceded, in the  light  of  the  Home  Office  Operational
    Guidance Note on Somalia of February 2004 Version 5  that  anyone  from
    the Bajuni tribe is at risk of persecution.  Furthermore, the Appellant
    being a woman, would be particularly vulnerable and could not  relocate
    within Somalia.

9.    The particular paragraph of the Operational Guidance Note  Mr  Morris
    relied on is 3.73.2 which states:

            "Sufficiency of protection/Internal relocation

            Those minority groups that are "politically  and  economically"
       the  weakest,  including  the  Bajuni,  are  least  able  to  secure
       protection from extortion, rape and other  human  rights  abuses  by
       criminal elements of more powerful clans and are somewhat vulnerable
       to persecution wherever they reside.  Internal relocation would  not
       be a reasonable option for those claiming to  be  a  member  of  the
       Bajuni group.

            AJH (Somalia) [2003] UKIAT 00094 Promulgated 03/10/03.  Persons
       of Bajuni or Bravanese ethnicity are likely to face persecution  and
       cannot reasonably relocate, particularly if they are female."

10.   In the light of the above  information,  the  Adjudicator's  decision
    that the Appellant does not have a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution
    based upon her ethnicity cannot stand.

11.   In the circumstances the Tribunal saw no purpose in  considering  the
    challenge to the Adjudicator's findings on Article 8.

12.   Accordingly, the Appellant's appeal is allowed.
