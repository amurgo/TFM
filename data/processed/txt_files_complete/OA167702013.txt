Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Thoree, Thoree & Co Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The respondent is a citizen of Macedonia and his date  of  birth  is  4
    December 1979.  I shall refer to the respondent as the appellant as  he
    was before the First-tier Tribunal.

2.   The appellant made an application for entry clearance  on  19  November
    2012 in order to join his British  citizen  spouse,  Catherine  Graham.
    The application was refused for a number of reasons on  25  July  2013.
    The decision was  maintained  by  an  Entry  Clearance  Officer  on  18
    February 2014.  The appellant appeals  against  the  decision  and  his
    appeal was allowed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal C Newberry in  a
    decision that was promulgated on 19 January 2015 following a hearing on
    8 September 2014.  Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Parkes in a decision of 10 March 2015.

3.   The application was refused by the Entry Clearance Officer pursuant  to
    S-EC.2.2(b) of Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules.   This  reads  as
    follows:-

         "S-EC.2.2. Whether or not to the applicant's knowledge -

             ...

             (b)  there has been a failure to disclose  material  facts  in
                  relation to the application."

4.   The  substance  of  the  decision  was  that  according  to  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer in the appellant's application form  at  Q55  he  was
    asked whether he had ever been deported, refused or otherwise  required
    to leave any country including the  United  Kingdom  in  the  last  ten
    years, to which he answered "no".  Thus, he failed to mention  that  he
    had been removed from the UK in 2005.

5.   He was also asked in the application form to  provide  details  of  all
    his trips to the United Kingdom in the last ten years.   He  stated  in
    answer to this that he came  to  London  in  2010  and  left  in  2012.
    However, he failed to mention that he had made a trip to the UK  before
    this visit  as  evidenced  by  his  being  encountered  by  immigration
    officials at Gatwick Airport in 2009.

6.   It was further noted by the Entry Clearance Officer that there  was  no
    record of him ever having applied for a visa  to  come  to  the  United
    Kingdom and that the passport which he submitted with  his  application
    which was issued on 30 September 2009 did not contain  any  information
    to suggest that it was used either to enter or exit the UK between 2010
    and 2012.  It is also alleged that the  appellant  was  encountered  at
    Gatwick Airport on 12 August 2009 attempting to embark on a  flight  to
    Pristina and claiming that he had  entered  the  United  Kingdom  three
    weeks previously on a flight from Germany using a  Macedonian  passport
    and that he did not have to see an Immigration Officer on arrival.   It
    was noted by the Entry Clearance Officer  that  the  passport  that  he
    presented on that occasion contained one stamp and that it was an  exit
    stamp from Macedonia in 2006.  Further  it  is  alleged  that  in  2009
    Macedonian nationals still required a visa in order to enter Germany.

7.   The Entry Clearance Officer  did  not  accept  that  the  marriage  was
    genuine and subsisting.

8.    Before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  there  was  a  statement  from  Mrs
    Catherine Graham and in relation to  the  issue  under  S-EC.2.2(b)  of
    Appendix FM her evidence was as follows:

         "3.  Faruk and I noted the contents of the refusal  letter.   Faruk
             first came  to  the  UK  in  1998  and  claimed  asylum.   His
             application for asylum was refused sometime  in  2000  and  he
             overstayed.   Faruk  was  encountered   by   the   Immigration
             Authorities and was removed to Pristina on 29 September  2005.
             In 2006, Faruk entered  the  UK  again  clandestinely.   Faruk
             returned to Macedonia on 12 August  2009.   On  this  occasion
             Faruk was encountered at Gatwick Airport when he was embarking
             a  flight  to  Pristina.    Faruk   entered   the   UK   again
             clandestinely in 2010 and returned  to  Macedonia  in  October
             2012.

         4.   Faruk entered the UK clandestinely  three  times.   The  first
             time, he entered the UK and claimed asylum as he was called up
             for his military service and as an ethnic Albanian he did  not
             want to serve in the Macedonian army.  During the  years  that
             Faruk was in the UK there has been a lot  of  tension  between
             ethnic Albanians and Macedonians.  Faruk did not  want  to  be
             involved and entered the UK twice clandestinely to escape  the
             pressures  from  his  own  community.   Faruk  told  me   that
             initially he did not think much of it, but now he  is  ashamed
             and feels very guilty  for  entering  the  UK  illegally.   Of
             course, this is no justification but just an explanation as to
             why he embarked on these long and dangerous trips to enter the
             UK illegally."

9.   In addition there was before the First-tier Tribunal a letter form  the
    appellant of 6 September 2004 which states, in relation  to  the  issue
    under S-EC.2.2(b) of Appendix FM as follows:-

         "I now know that what I did in entering the UK illegally was wrong.
          At the time I was very young and I was trying to get away  from  a
         hostile  situation  in  Macedonia  that  was  getting  increasingly
         difficult to live in.  Many of my friends were leaving the  country
         for the UK and I joined them to get away from the ethnic tension in
         the country.

         This is no justification for what I did, and as I have got older  I
         realise that this was not the right way to behave.  I am ashamed of
         my behaviour and very sorry for what I did."

10.  The judge heard evidence from the appellant's wife,  Catherine  Graham.
    He found that she was perfectly candid about her husband's  immigration
    record but made the point not only of his contrition but also  that  it
    was a relatively long time ago.  The judge went on  to  find  that  the
    sponsor was honest and truthful noting that she holds a senior position
    in the Institute  of  Cancer  Research.   He  attached  weight  to  the
    sponsor's evidence.  He went on to find as follows:-

         "13. The Entry Clearance Officer  recognises  in  his  review  that
             where a party makes false statements this would normally  lead
             to a refusal, but there is  a  'discretion  for  the  deciding
             authority'.

         14.  Having looked at the evidence in the round and heard the  wife
             (which the Entry Clearance Officer was  not  able  to  do)  my
             judgment is that this application should be allowed to  enable
             what I consider to be a genuine  and  subsisting  marriage  to
             continue  without  the  barrier  of  separation,  which  would
             inevitably occur due  to  the  wife's  demanding  professional
             life.

         15.   This  decision  in  no  way  condones  the  appellant's  past
             behaviour, but I am satisfied as to his contrition and do  not
             consider that the public interest is served by preventing  the
             parties continuing their married lives together."

11.  The grounds seeking leave to appeal maintain that  the  judge  did  not
    adequately reason the decision in accordance with the Immigration  Rule
    which requires in these circumstances that  such  an  application  will
    normally be refused.

12.  Mr Thoree submitted that the judge heard evidence from the  appellant's
    wife and he accepted it and the judge had discretion whether or not  to
    allow the appeal and it was a matter  for  him.   The  Entry  Clearance
    Officer did not find that the marriage was genuine and subsisting,  but
    the judge found in the appellant's favour in this respect.

Error of law

13.  In my view the judge materially erred.  Where S-EC.2.2.(b) is  engaged,
    as it clearly is in this case, according  to  S-EC.2.1.  the  applicant
    will normally be refused on grounds of suitability.  In this case it is
    a fact that the appellant failed to  disclose  material  facts  in  the
    application form.  There was no evidence before the First-tier Tribunal
    which dealt with that particular  issue.   The  evidence  related  very
    generally to his  immigration  history,  but  not  to  the  failure  to
    disclose.  The judge reached a conclusion  that  discretion  should  be
    exercised in the appellant's favour without engaging with the issue  of
    failing to disclose material facts.  In the light of the decision,  the
    appellant's immigration history and the failure to disclose (which  can
    only have been intentional and indeed there is no evidence that it  was
    not), the decision to exercise discretion in the appellant's favour  is
    inadequately  reasoned.   I  have  taken  into  account   Mr   Thoree's
    submissions and I acknowledge that the judge found  that  the  marriage
    was genuine and subsisting and that he accepted  the  evidence  of  the
    sponsor; however, the judge did not properly engage  with  S-EC.2.2.(b)
    and focused on the appellant's immigration history generally  accepting
    that he was remorseful.   The  judge  did  not  adequately  reason  why
    discretion should be exercised in favour of the appellant whilst  cases
    of this nature should normally be refused on grounds of suitability.

14.  I set aside the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  allow  the
    appeal under the Rules pursuant to Section 12(2)(a) of  the  Tribunals,
    Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and I went on to re-make  the  decision
    pursuant to Section 12(2)(a)(ii) of the 2007 Act.   Neither  party  had
    submitted further evidence in accordance with the  standard  directions
    to the parties.

15.  In the absence of evidence relating to the failure  to  disclose  facts
    in the application form and in the light of the appellant's immigration
    history, I conclude that the appellant intentionally failed to disclose
    material  facts  in  the  hope  of   gaining   entry   into   the   UK.
    Notwithstanding that he  is  in  a  genuine  marriage  with  a  British
    citizen, discretion should not be exercised in the appellant's  favour.
    I dismiss the appeal under the Rules.

16.  Article 8 of the 1950 Convention was raised in the  grounds  of  appeal
    before the First-tier Tribunal.  This was not determined by the  First-
    tier Tribunal and it is incumbent upon me to determine this  ground  of
    appeal.  The First-tier Tribunal found that the sponsor was a  credible
    witness and there is no need for me to go behind those  findings.   The
    marriage is genuine and subsisting.  The couple met in October 2011  on
    line and they married in Skopje on 9 November 2012.  She has two  adult
    children from a previous marriage and she has a well-paid job,  working
    for Cancer Research.  Her witness statement of 27 August 2014 indicates
    that from March 2012 she has been working for the Institute  of  Cancer
    Research on a salary of �50,000.  In the  sponsor's  witness  statement
    her evidence is that her mother, who lives in Yorkshire, was  diagnosed
    with cancer in January 2013 and had  major  surgery  in  February  2013
    resulting in ongoing radiotherapy.  The sponsor  visits  her  regularly
    and due to her mother's condition she has been  unable  to  travel  and
    spent time with her husband as much as they both would have liked.

17.  In following the approach outlined by the House of Lords  in  the  case
    of R v SSHD ex parte Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 it is obvious that the first
    three questions of the first three tests of the five identified by Lord
    Bingham of Cornhill should be  answered  in  the  affirmative.   It  is
    obvious that excluding the appellant interferes with his and his wife's
    right to respect for family life and I follow the  decision  in  Shamin
    Box [2002] UKIAT 02212 that the obligation imposed by Article 8  is  to
    promote the family life of those affected  by  the  decision.   On  the
    facts of this case the decision to refuse the appellant entry clearance
    interferes with his and his wife's private and  family  lives  and  the
    interference  is  of  sufficient  gravity  potentially  to  engage  the
    operation of Article 8.

18.  The Entry Clearance Officer  did  not  determine  whether  or  not  the
    appellant could meet the maintenance requirement of the Rules.  However
    the judge accepted the sponsor's evidence which would establish that he
    would be able  to  meet  the  maintenance  requirement  of  the  Rules.
    However, he cannot meet  the  suitability  requirements  of  the  Rules
    relating to entry clearance and family life with a  partner.   That  he
    cannot meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  is  a  weighty
    consideration in  favour  of  the  respondent  but  in  no  way  is  it
    determinative of the appeal.

19.  In the leading case of Huang [2007] UKHL 11, Lord Bingham said at  para
    20:-

         "In an article 8 case where this question  [i.e.  the  question  of
         proportionality]  is  reached,  the  ultimate  question   for   the
         appellate immigration authority is whether the refusal of leave  to
         enter or remain, in circumstances where  the  life  of  the  family
         cannot reasonably be expected to be enjoyed elsewhere, taking  full
         account of all considerations weighing in favour  of  the  refusal,
         prejudices  the  family  life  of  the  applicant   in   a   manner
         sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of the fundamental right
         protected  by  article  8.  If  the  answer  to  this  question  is
         affirmative, the refusal is unlawful  and  the  authority  must  so
         decide."

20.  A state is entitled as a matter of international  law  and  subject  to
    its treaty  obligations  to  control  the  entry  of  aliens  into  its
    territory and their residence  there.   An  appellant  cannot  normally
    succeed if all he can show is that he or she would  prefer  to  conduct
    his family life in the host member state.

21.  I must consider Article 8 and  proportionality  through  the  prism  of
    Section 117B of the 2002 Act.  The maintenance of effective immigration
    control is in the public interest and little weight should be given  to
    a relationship formed with a qualifying partner that is established  by
    a person at a time when the person is in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

22.  I have taken into account paragraph 16 of the judgment in Huang v  SSHD
    [2007] UKHL 11 which reads as follows:-

         "The authority will wish to consider and weigh all  that  tells  in
         favour of the refusal of leave which is challenged, with particular
         reference to justification  under  article  8(2).  There  will,  in
         almost any case, be certain general considerations to bear in mind:
         the general administrative desirability of applying known rules  if
         a system of immigration control is  to  be  workable,  predictable,
         consistent and fair as  between  one  applicant  and  another;  the
         damage to good administration and effective control if a system  is
         perceived  by  applicants  internationally  to  be  unduly  porous,
         unpredictable or perfunctory; the need to discourage  non-nationals
         admitted to the country temporarily from believing  that  they  can
         commit serious crimes and yet be allowed to  remain;  the  need  to
         discourage fraud, deception and deliberate breaches of the law; and
         so on....".

23.  In this case there are weighty  factors  in  the  respondent's  favour.
    The appellant's conduct is obviously relevant in terms of his  previous
    immigration history and his more recent intentional failure to disclose
    facts in his application form.  He has acted in a way  that  undermines
    immigration control.  The  appellant  and  the  sponsor's  relationship
    started at a time  when  the  appellant's  status  here  was  unlawful.
    Whilst I appreciate that the marriage is genuine and subsisting and  it
    will be difficult for the sponsor to leave her mother,  adult  children
    and career, there was no evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    there is no evidence before me relating to the degree of difficulty the
    sponsor would have in relocating to Macedonia in order to live with the
    appellant.

24.  The appellant has never lawfully been in the UK although  he  has  been
    here it seems on a number of occasions.

Notice of Decision

25.  The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

26.  The appeal is dismissed under Article  8  of  the  1950  Convention  on
    Human Rights.

27.  No anonymity direction is made.
