                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS




     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
        Tribunal Judge Kelly who in a decision promulgated on 10 April 2019
        dismissed the appellant's appeal on human rights grounds.



Background


     2. The appellant, a citizen of Zimbabwe, was born on 4  January  2000.
        An application for leave to enter the United Kingdom for settlement
        as the child or other dependent of a settled person was refused  by
        an  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (ECO)  based  at  the  British  High
        Commission in Pretoria on 15 February 2018.
     3.  The  application  was  made  pursuant  to  paragraph  297  of  the
        Immigration Rules. The appellant's sponsor, the person  settled  in
        the UK, is his mother. The ECO refused the application stating  the
        appellant  had  not  demonstrated  that   his   mother   had   sole
        responsibility for his upbringing, that the decision-maker was  not
        satisfied the appellant  had  demonstrated  there  are  serious  or
        compelling family and other considerations which made his exclusion
        from the UK undesirable, and it had not been  shown  the  appellant
        was not leading an independent life; leading to refusal pursuant to
        paragraphs 279 (e),(f), and (iii) of the Immigration Rules.
     4. The decision-maker considered article 8 ECHR outside the Rules  but
        concluded that as the appellant had not resided with his mother for
        at least 15 years and that as well as visiting the appellant in the
        past his mother could visit him in the future, it was not made  out
        there were any circumstances sufficient to warrant a grant of leave
        outside the Rules.
     5. The Judge, having considered the issues in the appeal,  and  having
        had the benefit of seeing and hearing oral evidence being given  by
        the sponsor, sets out  his  findings  of  fact  from  [16]  of  the
        determination. In that paragraph the Judge writes:


             16.  With one exception (considered at paragraph 24  below)  I
                  found  the  testimony  of  the  sponsor  to   be   cogent,
                  plausible, internally consistent, and either supported  by
                  or at least consistent with the documentary evidence  that
                  had been placed  before  me.  So  far  as  the  latter  is
                  concerned, I have noted Mrs Brewer's submission that  some
                  of those documents bear signatures that appear to be in  a
                  similar hand to others that purport to be signed by  other
                  people. I am not however a handwriting expert. I thus feel
                  that I lack the necessary experience and qualifications to
                  make a judgement on  the  matter.  I  have  not  therefore
                  attached adverse weight such similarities  in  my  overall
                  assessment of the appellant's credibility.  I  accordingly
                  find that the following facts  have  been  proved  on  the
                  balance of probabilities.


     6. Those findings are set out from [17] of the decision. At  [23]  the
        Judge writes:


             23.  I do not have any evidence at all concerning  the  wishes
                  of the appellant himself in this matter. I do not  have  a
                  witness statement from him, and  neither  did  his  mother
                  (the sponsor) make mention of whether her son was desirous
                  of leaving the country where he  has  resided  his  entire
                  life in order to settle in a country  that  he  has  never
                  even visited. Moreover, whilst  the  application  and  the
                  appeal against its refusal have been brought in  the  name
                  of the appellant, it is the sponsor who has  clearly  been
                  the moving force behind both. I am not therefore satisfied
                  that the decision to  refuse  his  application  for  entry
                  clearance is inconsistent with the best interests of  this
                  young man, who was just days away from legally  qualifying
                  as an adult  at  the  date  of  application  and  who  had
                  achieved that status by the time that his application  was
                  refused.


     7. The exception to the sponsor's credibility referred to by the Judge
        at [16] is set out at [24] in the following terms:


             24.  Although she acquired settled status in the UK some  7  �
                  years prior to her son making his application to join  him
                  in the UK, the sponsor nevertheless claimed that  she  had
                  been unable to afford the �1800 application fee until some
                  11 days before her son ceased to qualify for leave to join
                  her  in  the  UK  on  his  18th  birthday.  I  find   that
                  explanation implausible given that she had  by  that  time
                  been in full-time employment for at least 6 years and  did
                  not have any other financial dependents.  Her  explanation
                  is also undermined by her admission at  the  hearing  that
                  she had not wanted to disrupt her  son's  education  at  a
                  boarding school in Zimbabwe.  Having  considered  all  the
                  circumstances in the round, I find that  it  is  far  more
                  likely that the sponsor wanted her son to be educated  and
                  to enjoy the company of his friends and family in Zimbabwe
                  until such time as he became an adult  and  was  ready  to
                  begin his university education.


     8. As there is no appeal against the  refusal  under  the  Immigration
        Rules the appellant was required to challenge the decision  by  way
        of an appeal on human  rights  grounds.  The  Judge  sets  out  the
        structured approach to be found in Razgar at [25] answering each of
        the questions consecutively between [26  -  28]  in  the  following
        terms:


             26.  Although the sponsor and the  appellant  have  not  lived
                  together for more than a few weeks at  a  time  since  the
                  appellant was a mere 22 months of age, I  am  nevertheless
                  satisfied that 'family life' continued  to  exist  between
                  them up to and including the date  of  application.  I  am
                  satisfied of this because of the sponsor's involvement  in
                  her son's life and upbringing throughout  that  period  as
                  detailed in paragraphs 17 to 22 (above).


             27.  I am not however satisfied that the consequences  of  the
                  decision to refuse entry clearance are of such gravity  as
                  to engage the potential operation  of  Article  8  of  the
                  Convention. In reaching this conclusion, I have  borne  in
                  mind  that  the  threshold  for  engagement  is   not   an
                  especially high one, and that Article 8  will  readily  be
                  engaged where a consequence of the decision  is  that  the
                  person will be removed, thereby rupturing existing  social
                  and familial ties to the UK. However, the decision in  the
                  present case simply preserves the  status  quo  ante.  For
                  reasons that I highlighted at paragraph 22 and 23 (above),
                  the appellant is settled in Zimbabwe where he has  friends
                  and family members with whom he grew up and has thus known
                  all his life. By contrast, he has never been to the United
                  Kingdom and appears not to know anybody  here  other  than
                  his mother. Moreover, the decision to  refuse  them  entry
                  clearance for the purposes of settlement does not  inhibit
                  the  sponsor's  ability  to  continue  visiting   him   in
                  Zimbabwe, nor indeed his ability to begin visiting her  in
                  the UK as an unaccompanied adult.


             28.      The  remaining  'Razgar'  questions  only  arise  for
                  consideration if  each  of  the  first  two  are  answered
                  positively.  As  I  have  answered  the  second   question
                  negatively, it is unnecessary for me to consider if and to
                  what  extent  the  decision   was   in   accordance   with
                  immigration rules and/or the relevance of that  matter  to
                  the question of whether the decision was proportionate  to
                  the legitimate aim of maintaining the economic  well-being
                  of  the  country  to   the   consistent   application   of
                  immigration controls.


     9. The appellant sought permission to appeal asserting the Judge erred
        in law in requiring separate evidence from  the  appellant  on  the
        basis the Tribunal should have been satisfied with the evidence  of
        the sponsor which was found to be credible. The grounds also assert
        the Judge failed in the article 8 assessment in failing to consider
        that the appellant's relatives in Zimbabwe no longer wanted him  to
        live with them and had  provided  statements  to  that  effect  and
        failed to consider  other  difficulties  which  the  appellant  was
        facing in Zimbabwe as detailed in the sponsor's witness statement.
    10. Permission to appeal was granted by another judge of the First-Tier
        Tribunal the operative part of which is in the following terms:


             3.   It  is  arguable  that  the  Judge  fell  into  error  by
                  apparently making a further requirement to the Immigration
                  Rules  in  addition  to  "sole  responsibility"  for   the
                  appellant's  upbringing.   The   Judge's   findings   from
                  paragraph 16 to paragraph 21, clearly indicates that it is
                  accepted  that  the  UK-based   sponsor   has   had   sole
                  responsibility  for  the  appellant's  upbringing.  It  is
                  arguable that the Judge went on to conflate this Rule with
                  that requiring there to  be  compelling  family  or  other
                  circumstances making exclusion undesirable. The Judge then
                  went on to consider Article 8 outside the requirements  of
                  the  Immigration  Rules;  Rules  which  now  reflect   the
                  respondent's  Article   8   obligations   save   for   any
                  exceptional circumstances. It is arguable  also  that  the
                  Judge failed to make the Article 8 assessment through  the
                  "prism" of the Immigration Rules; Rules which the findings
                  indicate were fulfilled.



Error of law


    11. Whilst the Immigration Rules  are  not  determinative  of  a  human
        rights Article 8 appeal the fact  they  set  out  the  respondent's
        requirements for an individual to securing entitlement to leave  or
        remain in the United Kingdom shows they  are  of  great  importance
        when assessing the weight to be given to the public interest in  an
        article 8 proportionality assessment.
    12. It appears the Judge sets out the correct questions at [9] but then
        becomes totally distracted.
    13. In this case the Judge did not  undertake  the  assessment  of  the
        proportionality of the decision concluding that the consequences of
        the respondent's decision would not have  such  gravity  so  as  to
        engage the potential operation of article 8.
    14. It is important to consider the exact  terms  of  the  reasons  for
        refusal which was upheld by an Entry Clearance Manager.
    15. Paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules is in the following terms:


             Requirements for indefinite leave to enter the United  Kingdom
             as the child of a parent, parents or a  relative  present  and
             settled or being admitted for settlement in the United Kingdom


             297. The requirements to be met by a person seeking indefinite
             leave to enter the United Kingdom as the child  of  a  parent,
             parents or a relative present and settled  or  being  admitted
             for settlement in the United Kingdom are that he:


             (i) is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join  a  parent,
             parents or a relative in one of the following circumstances:


             (a) both  parents  are  present  and  settled  in  the  United
             Kingdom; or
             (b) both parents are being admitted on the same  occasion  for
             settlement; or
             (c) one parent is present and settled in  the  United  Kingdom
             and the other is being  admitted  on  the  same  occasion  for
             settlement; or
             (d) one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom or
             being admitted on the same occasion  for  settlement  and  the
             other parent is dead; or
             (e) one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom or
             being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and has had
             sole responsibility for the child's upbringing; or
             (f) one parent or a relative is present  and  settled  in  the
             United Kingdom or being admitted  on  the  same  occasion  for
             settlement and there are  serious  and  compelling  family  or
             other  considerations  which  make  exclusion  of  the   child
             undesirable and suitable arrangements have been made  for  the
             child's care; and


             (ii) is under the age of 18; and


             (iii) is not leading an independent life, is unmarried and  is
             not a civil partner, and has not formed an independent  family
             unit; and


             (iv) can, and will, be accommodated adequately by the  parent,
             parents or relative the  child  is  seeking  to  join  without
             recourse to public funds in accommodation  which  the  parent,
             parents or relative the child  is  seeking  to  join,  own  or
             occupy exclusively; and


             (v) can, and will, be maintained  adequately  by  the  parent,
             parents, or relative the child is  seeking  to  join,  without
             recourse to public funds; and


             (vi) holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance for entry in
             this capacity; and


             (vii) does not fall for refusal under the general grounds  for
             refusal.


    16. The finding the sponsor in the United Kingdom was  exercising  sole
        responsibility for the appellant's upbringing is only  one  of  the
        reasons why the application was refused. The  refusal  pursuant  to
        297(f) is in the alternative but the concern at (iii) is  not.  The
        evidence of the sponsor, accepted by the Judge, appears to be  that
        the appellant had not formed an independent life. In order for  the
        appellant to establish that he is not "leading an independent life"
        he must not have formed through choice a  separate  (and  therefore
        independent) social unit from  his  parents'  family  unit  whether
        alone or with others. It is arguable on the facts as found  by  the
        Judge that the appellant had demonstrated an ability to satisfy the
        requirements of the Immigration Rules pursuant  to  paragraph  297.
        That being so it is hard to see what the Secretary of State has  on
        her side of the scales in the proportionality  balancing  exercise.
        It is not  made  out  the  appellant  needs  to  do  any  more.  In
        particular we do not find the appellant needed to demonstrate  that
        it is in his best interests as he would in effect have to do if  he
        were relying on 297(1)(f).
    17. What  the  decision  is  arguably  silent  about  is  the  positive
        obligation incumbent upon a Higher  Contracting  State  to  promote
        family life. Whilst the refusal preserves the existing  pattern  it
        prevents the appellant and his mother from  developing  the  family
        life the Judge finds does exist any further.
    18. We find the Judge erred in law in a manner material to the decision
        to dismiss the appeal for the reasons set out  above.  We  set  the
        decision aside. We find the issue is  the  proportionality  of  the
        decision, Razgar question 5,  and  that  the  respondent  fails  to
        establish the decision is proportionate when weighing the competing
        interests in light of the  findings  pursuant  to  the  Immigration
        Rules. We substitute a decision to allow the appeal.


Decision

    19. The First-tier Judge materially erred in  law.  We  set  aside  the
        decision of the original Judge. We remake the decision as  follows.
        This appeal is allowed.


   Anonymity.


    20. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


We make no such  order  pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
