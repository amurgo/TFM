                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision  of  Judge  Scobbie
    made following a hearing at North Shields on 11th December 2013.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a national of Venezuela residing in Tenerife, born  on
    16 October 1968.  His history is as follows.  He met his partner, M  H,
    a British citizen, in 2001 in Tenerife.  In 2002  their  baby  daughter
    was born and she is now 10 years old and a UK  citizen.   Between  2003
    and 2006 the Appellant established three restaurants in Tenerife and in
    2006 M  H  decided  to  join  the  Appellant  there.   The  restaurants
    subsequently ran into financial difficulty. In 2008 M  H  had  a  heart
    attack and decided that she should remain in the UK with her  daughter.



 3. The Appellant continued to work in Tenerife, continuing  to  visit  his
    partner and child, and in 2013 decided to apply for leave to remain  in
    the UK as a partner.

 4. The judge considered whether the Appellant  could  succeed  within  the
    Immigration Rules and in  particular  whether  he  could  benefit  from
    paragraph EX1 but decided  that  he  could  not.   He  then  considered
    Article  8.  He  accepted  that  there  was  family  life  between  the
    Appellant, his partner and child and that refusal  of  the  application
    would potentially interfere  with  that  family  life.   He  took  into
    account the fact that the family had previously been  content  to  live
    apart  and  noted  that  the  circumstances  had  changed  because  the
    Appellant's daughter now wishes to live with her father. He  said  that
    the best interests of the child was to be with both parents.    However
    he also had to take into account other factors and said that the visits
    could continue in the future if the Appellant returned.  He noted  that
    the Appellant's partner was  now  earning  in  excess  of  the  minimum
    requirement under the Rules and if  they  married  he  would  have  the
    option of applying for entry clearance in  the  normal  way.   On  that
    basis he dismissed the appeal.

The Grounds of Appeal

 5. The Appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had failed to correctly apply EX1 and had failed to properly assess the
    proportionality of the decision.  There was no  real  consideration  of
    Section 55 of the 2009 Act nor of the case of ZH (Tanzania).

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Kimnell on 28th January 2014.

 7. On 15th February 2014 the  Respondent  served  a  reply  defending  the
    determination.

The Hearing

 8. Sabir [2014] UKUT 63 is determinative of the issue with respect to  the
    Immigration Rules.   Sabir held that it was plain from the architecture
    of the Rules as regards partners, that EX1 is parasitic on the relevant
    Rule within Appendix FM which otherwise grants leave to remain i.e  the
    structure of the Rules  as  presently  drafted  requires  it  to  be  a
    component part of the leave granting Rule.

 9. Since the Appellant was last granted leave to enter the UK as a visitor
    he does not comply with E-LTRP.2.1.  Furthermore he has not been living
    with his partner in the two years prior to the date of application  and
    therefore does not meet  the  definition  of  partner  as  set  out  in
    GEN.1.2.

10. Whilst the judge's determination could have been a  little  clearer  at
    paragraph 32, he reached the correct conclusion at paragraph 33 and was
    right to say that the Appellant cannot succeed under Appendix FM.

11. There is more merit in the argument relating to Article 8.

12. Whilst the judge states that it is in the best interests of  the  child
    to be with both parents and he accepted that it would not be ideal  for
    the Appellant to continue to visit her from Tenerife, in  reaching  his
    overall conclusion that removal would be proportionate  the  judge  did
    not take into account the evidence  from  the  school  and  the  family
    doctor who state that continuing separation was  having  a  significant
    adverse affect on the daughter's welfare.

13. At page 63 of the bundle there is a  letter  from  Meanwood  Church  of
    England Primary School which states that, since the refusal  there  has
    been a worrying decline in  the  Appellant's  daughter  S.    The  head
    teacher writes as follows:

         "She has been very tearful, very unhappy with everything, found  it
         hard to concentrate and seems unable to cope.   ...  S has been  in
         more  arguments  with  her  classmates  and  has  been   far   more
         confrontational. This really isn't S's  usual  conduct.   We  worry
         that this is going to impact on S's long-term emotional health  and
         have no doubt that the underlying problem is the uncertainty around
         her father's status.   Staff are working really hard to  support  S
         emotionally in ways we have never had to before. ... It is only  by
         the staff keeping her on task all the time that  S  is  maintaining
         her current academic levels.   Previously  we  have  never  had  to
         cajole S into doing her work but she seems to have no concentration
         whatsoever at the moment. She also seems  to  lack  motivation  and
         interest, her response being tears  when  staff  ask  her  why  she
         hasn't completed a task.  I sincerely hope that S's father will  be
         able to remain in the UK. The impact on his daughter is already  so
         sad for us as staff who have known her for  a  very  long  time  to
         see."'

14. There is also a letter from the Meanwood Group Practice in relation  to
    the daughter. Dr Hayes writes:

         "The stress caused to S by not  having  her  father  as  a  regular
         presence is significant.  S has had problems with  bedwetting  when
         he is away and having to constantly readjust to the changes in  her
         home situation affects her mood and behaviour.  If M were  to  have
         his application rejected then his only option would be to move back
         to Venezuela.  This would obviously not be the best outcome for the
         family as a whole and I  would  have  serious  concerns  about  the
         effect this might have on S and M's mental health."

15. In failing to take account of relevant evidence the judge erred in law.
    The decision is set aside.

16. The best interests of  the  child  in  this  case  are  clear.   Absent
    countervailing factors, they should normally be followed (ZH (Tanzania)
    UKSC 4).  There are none here. The  Appellant  has  complied  with  the
    requirements of immigration control at all times.  There  would  be  no
    economic detriment to the UK by his remaining here  since  his  partner
    earns over ï¿½23,000.  The circumstances in his case are highly  unusual,
    and this is a very longstanding relationship. Although the reasons  for
    refusal letter makes reference to the ability of the child to settle in
    Venezuela and to go to school there, sensibly  neither  the  Presenting
    Officer at the hearing before Judge Scobbie nor Mr Diwnycz pursued that
    line of reasoning.  S is a British citizen who has right to  enjoy  the
    benefits  which  her  citizenship  entitles  her  to,  including  being
    educated in the UK.  Chikwamba remains good law and it is difficult  to
    see what purpose could be served by requiring the Appellant  to  return
    to Venezuela to make an application for entry clearance  which  on  the
    facts is very likely to succeed.  When balanced against the clear  best
    interests of the child, it would be disproportionate to require him  to
    do so.

Decision

17. The original judge erred in law.  His decision  is  set  aside.  It  is
    remade as follows.  The Appellant's appeal is dismissed with respect to
    the Immigration Rules and allowed under Article 8.

18. An anonymity order is made.
