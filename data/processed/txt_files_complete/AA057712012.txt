For the Appellant:     Mr A Miah, Counsel instructed by Edward Alam &
Associates
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, who was born  on  1  January  1992,  is  a  national  of
    Bangladesh.  He arrived in this country at some date prior to 21  March
    2007, when he claimed asylum.  He had apparently left Bangladesh on  28
    October 2006 and travelled to this country with a couple known  to  his
    parents, and was taken to the address of a cousin, Mr Syed Ahmed.

 2. Following the  usual  interviews,  the  appellant's  asylum  claim  was
    refused, but on 17 May 2007, he was granted limited leave to remain  in
    this country until 30 July 2009 on discretionary grounds in  accordance
    with the  respondent's  published  policy  relating  to  the  grant  of
    discretionary leave to minors.

 3. Before the expiry of this discretionary leave (which had, as is  usual,
    been granted until he was 17�) on 21 May 2009 the appellant applied  to
    vary his leave to remain  on  the  grounds  that  he  was  entitled  to
    asylum/humanitarian protection.

 4. The respondent took nearly three years to  consider  this  application,
    but eventually, on 16 May 2012 a decision was made  refusing  to  grant
    the appellant further leave and refusing to vary his leave to enter  or
    remain in this country.  The respondent, on  the  same  occasion,  also
    made a decision to remove the appellant  by  way  of  directions  under
    Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 5. The appellant appealed against this decision, and his appeal was  heard
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge McIntosh, sitting at Taylor  House  on
    13 July 2012.  It is recorded in the determination, referred to  below,
    that  at  that  hearing  the  appellant's  representative,  Ms  Akther,
    "confirmed on the appellant's behalf that he no longer seeks to  pursue
    an asylum claim but appeals against the decision of  the  Secretary  of
    State on the grounds that his removal from the United Kingdom would  be
    contrary to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights".

 6. In this determination, signed on 23 July 2012 and  promulgated  shortly
    after, Judge McIntosh dismissed the appellant's appeal.   She  made  no
    separate decision regarding the Section 47 removal directions which had
    been made.

 7. The appellant now appeals against this decision, permission having been
    granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Cruthers on 23 August 2012.

 8. In the grounds in support of the application for permission to  appeal,
    with regard to the substantive decision, it is submitted first that the
    judge had not taken properly into account the long period of  time  the
    appellant had been in this country, but the main argument  is  that  by
    reason of the respondent's delay in considering his  application,  this
    "has also created a legitimate expectation that leave would  ultimately
    be granted".  It is said further (at paragraph 8 of the  grounds)  that
    "the appellant has established his life in the UK knowing that if  [the
    respondent] wanted to remove him any earlier, they would've taken steps
    to do so earlier".

 9. It is also argued (at paragraph 9) that "since the HL stated that where
    there  has  been  substantial  delay  this  is  capable  of   being   a
    determinative factor in Article 8 cases, [this] goes in favour  of  the
    applicant  in  the  proportionality  exercise.   Hence  the   balancing
    exercise has not been carried out properly".

10. It is also said that voluntary work which the appellant was  doing  and
    the fact that he was still in education was not taken into account.

11. When setting out his reasons for granting permission to  appeal,  Judge
    Cruthers stated as follows:

         "1...    At the hearing on 13 July  2012  the  appellant's  Counsel
             indicated that asylum grounds were not pursued -  this  appeal
             is pursued only on the  suggestion  that  the  decision  under
             appeal represents a disproportionate breach of the appellant's
             rights pursuant  to  Article  8  of  the  [ECHR].   The  judge
             explained her reasons for rejecting the  appellant's  case  in
             her paragraphs 22 and 23.

         2.   I suspect that there is little substance in at least  some  of
             the complaints made in the grounds but  it  may  be  that  the
             judge did err in some of the ways alleged.  The way  in  which
             the judge dealt with the Home Office's delay here (from 21 May
             2009 to 16 May 2012 - paragraphs 3 and 4) may be of particular
             concern:

                . In summarising the appellant's case in her  paragraphs  17
                  and 18 the judge did re-produce paragraphs regarding  Home
                  Office delay from EB (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL 0041.

                . But in her operative paragraphs 22 and 23, the  judge  did
                  not explain what significance, if any, she attached to the
                  delay in this case (as per ground 5).

         3.   There is, therefore, sufficient in the grounds to make a grant
             of permission appropriate."

12. However, at paragraph 4 of the Reasons  for  Decision,  Judge  Cruthers
    continued as follows:

         "The appellant should not take this  grant  of  permission  as  any
         indication that his appeal will ultimately  be  successful.   There
         seems to be no claim to the appellant having a family life  in  the
         United Kingdom.  In the  last  analysis,  having  studied  in  this
         country, and having  played  cricket  for  various  clubs,  may  be
         insufficient to establish a disproportionate breach  of  Article  8
         (when  weighed  against  the   public   interest   in   maintaining
         immigration control)."

13. It may be wondered, in light of this observation, how it was considered
    to be arguable that there was  any  material  error  of  law  in  Judge
    McIntosh's  determination,  but  in  any   event,   this   appeal   was
    subsequently listed before me, following directions which I gave on  30
    September 2013, for a hearing which should be conducted "on  the  basis
    that it will be confined to whether the determination of the First-tier
    Tribunal should be set aside for legal error and, if  so,  whether  the
    decision in the appeal can be  re-made  without  having  to  hear  oral
    evidence; in which  eventuality  the  Tribunal  is  likely  to  proceed
    immediately with a view to re-making the decision".



The Hearing

14. I heard  submissions  on  behalf  of  both  parties  which  I  recorded
    contemporaneously.  As  these  submissions  are  contained  within  the
    Record of Proceedings, I shall not set out below everything  which  was
    said to me during the course of the  hearing.   I  have,  however,  had
    regard to all the submissions made as  well  as  to  all  the  material
    contained within the file, whether or  not  the  same  is  referred  to
    specifically below.

15. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Miah adopted the grounds, which had been
    drafted by other Counsel.  In relation to paragraphs 22 and 23  of  the
    determination, reliance was also placed on the  observations  of  Judge
    Cruthers where he had stated that the  judge  had  not  explained  what
    significance if any she attached to the delay.  Looking  at  paragraphs
    22 and 23, there had been no reference to the delay which had occurred.

16. It was accepted on behalf of  the  appellant  that  if  the  judge  had
    considered the delay but had still reached the finding she  did,  there
    could have been no complaint about her decision.  It was  open  to  the
    judge to arrive at findings of fact, but because she had not considered
    the delay, this was a material error.  It was a factor which  might  be
    significant because during that time, this was the first few  years  of
    the appellant's adulthood.  He was being educated in this  country  and
    was developing here.  This appellant had arrived in this country  as  a
    minor, he had claimed asylum, and when that was refused he was  granted
    discretionary leave to remain  until  he  was  17�,  which  was  normal
    practice with regard to a minor.  He then applied to vary  that  leave,
    before he was 18.



Application to amend Grounds

17. At the  start  of  his  submissions,  Mr  Miah  asserted  that  if  the
    respondent had dealt with the application in  a  "normal  period",  she
    would have considered paragraph 298 of  the  Immigration  Rules,  which
    essentially say that if an applicant has a relative in the UK - and  in
    this case the appellant's cousin was here - and if that  applicant  was
    under the age of 18, which he was at the date of  application,  and  if
    that applicant could show there were serious and compelling reasons why
    he should not be returned, then he  would  be  entitled  to  indefinite
    leave to remain.

18. When Mr Wilding objected to this submissions being made, on  the  basis
    that there had been no application to amend the grounds of  appeal,  Mr
    Miah submitted first that this was an alternative submission, but  then
    applied to vary the grounds to include this argument.  This application
    was opposed by the respondent.

19. Essentially, Mr Miah's argument was that because during the  period  of
    delay, the appellant reached his 18th birthday, he was deprived  of  an
    argument which he could have run, under paragraph 298(i)(d).  Therefore
    he had been prejudiced by the delay.

20. It is unnecessary to set out in any greater detail  the  way  in  which
    this argument was put, as in  my  judgment  it  is  completely  without
    merit.  My reasons are as follows.

21. The relevant parts of paragraph 298 of the Rules provide as follows:

         "Requirements for indefinite leave to remain in the United  Kingdom
         as the child of a parent, parents or a relative present and settled
         or being admitted for settlement in the United Kingdom

         298.  The requirements to be met by  a  person  seeking  indefinite
              leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  as  the  child  of  a
              parent, parents or a relative  present  and  settled  in  the
              United Kingdom are that he:

             (i)  is seeking to remain with a parent, parents or a relative
                  in one of the following circumstances:...

                  (d)  one parent or a relative is present  and  settled  in
                      the  United  Kingdom  and  there  are   serious   and
                      compelling family or other considerations which  make
                      exclusion  of  the  child  undesirable  and  suitable
                      arrangements have been made for the child's care; and

             (ii) [he] has limited leave to enter or remain in  the  United
                  Kingdom, and

                  (a)  is under the age of 18...

             (iv) can, and will, be accommodated adequately by the  parent,
                  parents or relative the child was admitted to join without
                  recourse  to  public  funds  in  accommodation  which  the
                  parent, parents or relative  the  child  was  admitted  to
                  join, own or occupy exclusively; and

             (v)  can, and will, be maintained adequately  by  the  parent,
                  parents or  relative  the  child  was  admitted  to  join,
                  without recourse to public funds...".

22. The first, and obvious point which must be made is that the  respondent
    was not considering an application under paragraph 298  of  the  Rules,
    but an application for asylum or humanitarian protection.  Accordingly,
    even if the decision had been made relatively quickly (and in  argument
    Mr Miah accepted that if a decision  had  been  given  just  after  the
    appellant's 18th birthday he could not have then argued that there  had
    been undue delay), the respondent would not have  considered  paragraph
    298 of the Rules before the appellant's 18th  birthday.   Even  if  the
    respondent had been minded to trawl through the Rules to see  if  there
    was any conceivable reason why  the  appellant  should  be  allowed  to
    remain (after his solicitors had failed to advance such grounds on  his
    behalf) in this case arguments had not been advanced on behalf  of  the
    appellant that the other requirements of the Rules had been  satisfied,
    such as maintenance and accommodation.  Although it may  well  be  that
    had an application been made under paragraph 298, the  maintenance  and
    accommodation requirements would not have presented a major difficulty,
    in circumstances where such an  application  had  not  been  made,  the
    respondent  could  not  reasonably  be  expected  to   consider   this,
    especially in the absence of  properly  structured  evidence  that  the
    maintenance and accommodation requirements were satisfied.

23. In addition, of course, there remains the fact that it is hard to  see,
    given that there were challenges made to  the  appellant's  credibility
    with regard to his asylum claim, (and that the  asylum  claim  was  not
    even pursued on appeal), how an argument that there were such  "serious
    and compelling reasons" why he should not be required to go back to his
    home country that he should be allowed  to  remain  in  the  UK,  could
    possible have succeeded.

24. Additionally, not only was this argument not advanced before the First-
    tier Tribunal, but it was not even contained within the grounds seeking
    permission to appeal to this Tribunal, and nor was  it  raised  at  all
    until the hearing.

25. In those circumstances, I refused permission to the appellant to  amend
    his grounds.  For the avoidance of doubt,  I  consider  the  suggestion
    that the appellant could have been prejudiced by not now being able  to
    take advantage of an argument which could have been made before he  was
    18 as unarguable on the facts of this case.

26. Mr Miah appreciated, when making his submissions,  that  the  grant  of
    permission was narrow and that if the  Tribunal  had  been  correct  to
    reject the arguments which he had just made regarding paragraph 298  of
    the Rules, the main argument he was left with was delay in itself.   It
    was appreciated that in the grant of  permission,  Judge  Cruthers  had
    said that the appellant's sporting  activities  may  in  themselves  be
    insufficient to establish a disproportionate breach of Article  8  when
    weighed against the public interest in maintaining immigration control.



27. Mr Miah appreciated that it would be argued  that  the  proportionality
    exercise  had  been  carried  out  at  paragraphs  21  and  22  of  the
    determination with specific reference to  the  Razgar  test.   However,
    there had been a significant delay between 2009 and 2012,  a  total  of
    three years, which had not been the appellant's fault.

28. In answer to an observation from the Tribunal that it would appear that
    the appellant had chosen to stay, while knowing that his  position  was
    precarious, Mr Miah replied that those were his submissions.

29. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Wilding submitted  there  had  been  no
    material  error  in  the  judge's  determination.   The  judge  had  at
    paragraphs 22 and 23 taken account of the totality of  the  appellant's
    private life case that was put before her, and had weighed this in  the
    balance, but had found the  respondent's  decision  was  proportionate.
    From a summation of the appellant's grounds of appeal and the grant  of
    permission, the entire basis of the appellant's  case  was  in  essence
    that delay was the determinative factor in this case.   That  was  what
    was said at paragraphs 8 and 9 of the grounds.

30. The point that was made today was that delay as a factor had  not  been
    taken into account.  In this regard the respondent would  rely  on  the
    decision of the House of Lords in EB (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL 41 and of the
    Court of Appeal in AZ (Bangladesh) [2009] EWCA Civ 15,  both  of  which
    were handed to the Tribunal.  There were  three  categories  of  effect
    which a delay can have.  The first was that this delay could lead to  a
    strengthening of an applicant's Article 8  position.   In  the  present
    case, this was plainly irrelevant, but the judge had taken into account
    the period of time in which the appellant had  been  in  this  country.
    The second category concerned  circumstances  where  relationships  had
    developed beyond a point at which they would have done  had  there  not
    been  the  delay,  because  there  had  been  an  assumption  that   an
    applicant's precarious position had become less precarious.  The  third
    category was the prejudice point, broadly speaking.  The example  given
    in EB (Kosovo) was that in that case the applicant's  cousin  had  been
    granted exceptional leave to remain but  EB  had  not  because  of  the
    delay.  However, this was not applicable here.

31. In terms of the  actual  impact  of  the  delay,  therefore,  the  only
    relevant category which could be said to apply was the first, which was
    that the appellant had  been  able  to  establish  and  strengthen  his
    private life in this country, but  this  had  been  considered  by  the
    judge.  While it might be that in a  finely  balanced  case  the  delay
    would tip the balance, that would only be so in a case  very  different
    from the circumstances of this case.  There was no  material  error  of
    law in this determination.  The judge had considered  fully  everything
    put before her and the appeal should therefore be dismissed.



Discussion

32. I deal first with the Section 47 removal  decision,  which  Mr  Wilding
    conceded at the beginning of the hearing was not in accordance with the
    law in line with current jurisprudence, and I shall so find.   However,
    the substance of this appeal is directed to the substantive decision.

33. It is clear that the judge considered all the factors (save delay as  a
    stand alone factor) which were advanced as  to  why  removal  would  be
    disproportionate,  before  deciding  that  the   public   interest   in
    maintaining   immigration    control    outweighed    these    factors.
    Notwithstanding the submissions advanced in the grounds, it is not,  in
    my judgment, even arguable that by reason of the  delay  the  appellant
    acquired any legitimate expectation  that  leave  would  ultimately  be
    granted.  Nor is it arguable that the  appellant  had  established  his
    life in this country knowing that  if  the  respondent  had  wanted  to
    remove him earlier she would have taken steps to do so.  Mr  Miah  very
    sensibly did not seek to rely on these grounds, but argued rather  that
    had appropriate weight been given to the delay, in this case this could
    have tipped the balance in the appellant's favour.

34. In my judgment, this  argument  cannot,  on  the  fact  of  this  case,
    succeed.  As has been made clear both by  the  House  of  Lords  in  EB
    (Kosovo) and  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  the  subsequent  case  of  AZ
    (Bangladesh), delay in circumstances such as this can  only  assist  an
    applicant's Article 8 claim in the ways set out  in  those  cases.   In
    this case, for reasons which I have already given above, it  is  simply
    not arguable that the appellant  has  suffered  prejudice  in  the  way
    asserted, by being unable to mount a claim he would otherwise have been
    able to mount under paragraph 298 of the Immigration Rules.  Even if  I
    had allowed the appellant to amend his grounds of appeal to argue this,
    this argument would have been bound to fail  for  the  reasons  I  have
    given above, and it was mainly for this reason that I refused to  allow
    such an amendment to be made.

35. The second category which is referred to in AZ  (Bangladesh)  is  where
    relationships have built up during the period of delay, during  a  time
    when the appellant's  position  in  this  country  would  otherwise  be
    precarious.  On the facts of this case, this has not happened here.

36. Regarding the first category, the judge plainly took into  account  the
    length of time the appellant had been here, when considering whether it
    would be disproportionate to require  him  to  leave.   The  judge  had
    regard to such private life as the appellant now had in  this  country.
    She found, having considered  the  evidence,  that  the  appellant  had
    established a private life in the UK and that the  decision  to  remove
    him from the UK would amount to interference  with  that  private  life
    such that his Article 8 rights were engaged.   Having  then  considered
    that the interference would be lawful in the circumstances and that  it
    would also be necessary (the third  and  fourth  questions  posited  in
    Razgar) she then set out her reasons for finding that it would also  be
    proportionate.   In  my  judgment,  the  reasons  she  has  given,   at
    paragraphs 22 and 23 of her judgment, are unimpeachable  and  it  would
    have been surprising if any other judge had found differently.

37. It follows, there being no material error of law  in  Judge  McIntosh's
    determination, that the substantive appeal must be dismissed and I will
    so find.



Decision

I set aside the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  as  containing  a
material error of law insofar as it did not deal with the removal  decision,
and I substitute the following decision:

The appellant's appeal against the substantive decision to refuse  to  grant
him asylum or humanitarian protection is dismissed.

The appellant's appeal is also dismissed under Article 8.

The appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  to  remove  him  by  way  of
directions under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act
2007, which was made simultaneously with the decision to  refuse  his  claim
for asylum or humanitarian protection, is allowed to the  extent  that  that
decision was not in accordance with the law.
