                            DECISION AND REASONS

       1.     This is an appeal  by  the  Secretary  of  State  against  the
      decision of the First-tier Tribunal (F-tTJ C M A  Jones)  allowing  an
      appeal by the applicant against the respondent's decision made  on  29
      May 2013 refusing her leave to remain as a spouse and making a removal
      decision.  In this decision I will refer to the parties as  they  were
      before the First-tier Tribunal, the applicant as the appellant and the
      Secretary of State as the respondent.

Background

       2. The appellant is a citizen of Thailand, born on 17 May 1985.   She
      first met her husband in  December  2009  and  they  were  married  in
      Thailand on 28 September 2010.  Their son was born there on 21 January
      2011 by which time his father had returned to the UK.  On 10  December
      2011 the appellant and her son travelled to the UK.  She had  obtained
      entry clearance as a visitor and her  son  travelled  on  his  British
      passport.  The appellant returned to Thailand with her son in May 2012
      and Mr Jolley travelled there in June 2012  for  six  months  when  he
      tried to obtain work as an English teacher but this did not work  out.
      In December 2012 the family returned to the UK, the  appellant  having
      obtained entry clearance as a visitor for six months.  She was due  to
      return to Thailand by 25 April 2013 but on 22 April 2013  she  applied
      for variation of her leave to enter.  That application was refused  as
      she was unable to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules under
      the partner route  as  she  could  not  meet  the  immigration  status
      requirement set out in E-LTRP.2.1 or under the parent route by  virtue
      of E-LTRPT.3.1(a).  The respondent went on to  consider  private  life
      under the provisions of para 276ADE but found that she was not able to
      meet any of the conditions set out in that rule.

       3.     In her grounds of appeal the appellant confirmed that she  had
      spent 26 years of her life in her home country of Thailand but was now
      married to a British citizen, their son was also  British  and  needed
      both his mother and father together.  She said that a lot had happened
      in her life; her mother died when she was 10.  She had been married to
      a Thai national for five years but had divorced him in June 2009.  She
      did not see a future for herself, her husband and son if they  had  to
      live separate lives in different countries.

       4.     In the First-tier Tribunal the judge heard evidence  from  the
      appellant and her husband.  She described the appellant  as  a  wholly
      credible witness and commented that the facts of the case were not  in
      dispute [15].  She found she could not meet the requirements  of  para
      276ADE.  She went on to consider the provisions of Appendix FM finding
      that the appellant did not fall for refusal  under  S-LTR.   She  held
      that it was clear that the appellant fulfilled all the requirements of
      E-LTRP.1 but said that E-LTRP.2.1 stated that an applicant must not be
      in the UK as a visitor as was  the  appellant  unless  exception  EX.1
      applied.  She found that it did.  She also went on to consider whether
      it would be reasonable to expect their son to  leave  the  UK  in  the
      light of the provisions  of  s.55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
      Immigration Act 2009.

       5.     The judge noted that he was a British citizen  living  in  the
      UK and his citizenship carried with it the rights  to  free  education
      and health care which would only be available in Thailand at  a  cost.
      She referred to the judgment of the Supreme Court in ZH  (Tanzania)  v
      Secretary of State [2011] UKSC 4 that nationality was not a trump card
      but was of particular importance in assessing the best interests of  a
      child.  It had  been  argued  that  the  appellant  should  return  to
      Thailand and make an application  for  entry  clearance  but  in  this
      context the judge referred to Chikwamba [2008]  UKHL  40  and  to  the
      comment by Lord Brown that:

           "...  only  comparatively  rarely,  certainly  in  family  cases
           involving children, should an article 8 appeal be  dismissed  on
           the basis that it would be proportionate  and  more  appropriate
           for the appellant to apply for leave from abroad."


      In summary, the judge found that it would not  be  reasonable  in  the
      light of Article 8 and the decisions in Chikwamba and  ZH  (Tanzania),
      to expect the child to leave the UK, that EX.1 applied  and  therefore
      the appeal was allowed [19].

       6.     Permission to appeal was granted by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      on the ground that it was arguable that the judge had erred in law  by
      allowing the appeal firstly under the Immigration Rules  despite  that
      fact that  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the  mandatory  eligibility
      criteria and secondly on Article 8 grounds  without  setting  out  any
      specific compelling circumstances for so doing.

Submissions

       7.     Mr Nath submitted that the judge had been wrong to  allow  the
      appeal under Appendix FM as the  appellant  was  unable  to  meet  the
      immigration status requirements.  Paragraph EX.1 did not apply  to  an
      appellant who was in the UK as a visitor.  He referred to  and  relied
      on the Tribunal determination in Sabir (Appendix FM -  EX.1  not  free
      standing) [2014] UKUT 63.  So  far  as  Article  8  was  concerned  he
      submitted that the judge  had  not  given  adequate  reasons  for  her
      decision and had failed to  consider  the  guidance  in  the  Tribunal
      determination of Gulshan (Article 8 - new rules  -  correct  approach)
      [2013] UKUT 640 or whether there  were  compelling  circumstances  not
      sufficiently recognised under the Rules.

       8.     Mr Garrod submitted that contrary to the  submissions  of  the
      respondent the judge  had referred to numerous examples of  compelling
      circumstances particularly in relation to the  child  of  the  family.
      She had considered ZH (Tanzania) and had  referred  to  the  Court  of
      Appeal judgment in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 in  [20]  of  her
      determination.  She had explained why she regarded those circumstances
      as compelling.  The fact that she had not labelled them as such had no
      material bearing on the outcome of the appeal.   He  referred  to  and
      relied on Mukarkar v Secretary of State [2006] EWCA Civ  1045  and  in
      particular to [40] where Carnwath LJ said that the mere fact that  one
      Tribunal had reached what might seem an unusually generous view of the
      facts did not mean that it had made an error of law.  So  far  as  the
      argument about whether EX.1 applied in the present case,  he  did  not
      seek to make any submissions beyond  the  assertion  in  the  Rule  24
      response that it was for the respondent to prove  that  EX.1  did  not
      apply in the present case.




Consideration of whether there is an Error of Law

      9. The issue for me at this stage of the appeal is whether the First-
      tier Tribunal erred in law such that its decision should be set aside.
       I shall deal firstly with the position under  the  Immigration  Rules
      and Appendix FM.  The immigration status  requirements  for  leave  to
      remain as a partner are set out in E-LTRP.2.1 which reads as follows:

        "E-LTRP.2.1.  The applicant must not be in the UK -
        (a)  as a visitor;
        (b)  with valid leave granted for a period of  6  months  or  less,
             unless that leave is as a fiancï¿½(e) or proposed civil  partner,
             or was granted pending the outcome of family court  or  divorce
             proceedings; or
        (c)  on temporary admission or temporary release (unless  paragraph
             EX.1. applies).
        E-LTRP.2.2.  The applicant must not be  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
        immigration laws (disregarding any  period  of  overstaying  for  a
        period of 28 days or less), unless paragraph EX.1. applies."

     The Tribunal decision in Sabir has made it clear that  paragraph  EX.1
      is not a free standing paragraph but only applies in the circumstances
      set out in the Rules.  I am satisfied that the drafting of  E-LTRP.2.1
      makes it clear that EX.1 only applies to sub-paragraph  (c)  and  does
      not apply either to (a) or (b).  It must  therefore  follow  that  the
      judge erred in law by finding that it was open  to  the  appellant  to
      rely on EX.1 despite the fact that she had made her application  as  a
      visitor and to allow the appeal on that basis.

    10. So far as the appeal under  Article  8  is  concerned,  I  am  also
      satisfied that the judge erred in law.  She was clearly right to  take
      into account the child's interests as a primary consideration  in  the
      light of s.55 of the 2009 Act and the judgment of the Supreme Court in
      ZH (Tanzania) but she failed to assess proportionality in the  context
      of the Immigration Rules or to take into account the  public  interest
      in maintaining an effective system  of  immigration  control.   In  EB
      (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL 41 Lord Bingham said at [10]:
        "10. In Huang [2007] 2AC167, para 16, the  House  acknowledged  the
             need, in almost any case, to give  weight  to  the  established
             regime of immigration control:
                  "The authority will wish to consider and weigh  all  that
                  tells  in  favour  of  the  refusal  of  leave  which  is
                  challenged, with particular  reference  to  justification
                  under article 8(2). There will, in almost  any  case,  be
                  certain general  considerations  to  bear  in  mind:  the
                  general administrative  desirability  of  applying  known
                  rules if  a  system  of  immigration  control  is  to  be
                  workable, predictable, consistent and fair as between one
                  applicant and another; the damage to good  administration
                  and  effective  control  if  a  system  is  perceived  by
                  applicants   internationally   to   be   unduly   porous,
                  unpredictable or perfunctory; the need to discourage non-
                  nationals  admitted  to  the  country  temporarily   from
                  believing that they can commit serious crimes and yet  be
                  allowed  to  remain;  the  need  to   discourage   fraud,
                  deception and deliberate breaches of the law; and so on."
                  "


     11. It is not suggested that any issue  arises  of  committing  serious
      crimes but nonetheless this  is  a  case  where  entry  clearance  was
      granted as a  visitor  and  it  is  clear  from  the  entry  clearance
      application that the stated intention was to stay for ten weeks and to
      leave  the  UK  on  27  February  2013.    Further,   when   assessing
      proportionality no consideration appears to have  been  given  to  the
      fact that the appellant could not meet  the  maintenance  or  language
      requirements of the Rules.  She is therefore in a  different  position
      from the appellant in Chikwamba where the Court proceeded on the basis
      that the only requirement of the Rules which could not be met was  the
      necessity of making an application outside the UK.

     12. I am satisfied that these errors had  a  material  bearing  on  the
      outcome of the appeal and in these circumstances the proper course  is
      for this decision to be set aside.  Mr Nath submitted  that  I  should
      proceed to re-make the decision on the basis of  the  evidence  before
      the First-tier Tribunal but Mr Garrod argued that the appellant should
      have a further opportunity of adducing up-to-date  evidence.   In  the
      light of the fact that  the  best  interests  of  a  young  child  are
      involved, I am satisfied that the right course is to adjourn  and  for
      the appeal to be re-listed for the decision to be re-made at a resumed
      hearing.


  13. I gave directions that: (i) the  appellant  have  permission  to  file
      further witness statements and documentary evidence within 21 days  of
      the date of hearing and (ii) skeleton arguments be filed 7 days before
      the date of the resumed hearing.


   Further Evidence


  14. The appellant relied on the documentary evidence filed at  the  First-
      Tier Tribunal (1A) with a further bundle of documents (2A)  filed  for
      this hearing.


  15. The appellant gave oral evidence. She adopted her statement of 28 June
      2014 in 2A. This confirms that  she  has  been  in  the  UK  since  14
      December 2012 having arrived on a family visit visa. She  was  due  to
      leave in April 2013 but due to her situation she was unable to  return
      to Thailand with her son as she believed they would be destitute.  Her
      father had died in 2012 and  as  her  mother  had  also  passed  away,
      leaving her with a brother and sister but she  did  not  have  contact
      with them. She would have no home to go to. Her husband found work  in
      February 2013 so he did not have enough funds to support her  back  in
      Thailand and could not meet the requirements for a spouse  visa.  From
      June 2013 her husband had been in full time employment and was earning
      a salary of around ï¿½25,000. Her son was now in school five days a week
      and had many friends. She and her husband had been renting their  home
      for 10 months. She confirmed that their son was  born  on  21  January
      2011. He was British and was now registered with a doctor in the UK.

  16. In cross examination she said that she had applied for her last  visit
      visa on 16 October  2012.  Her  husband  had  then  been  teaching  in
      Thailand. She was not in contact with her brother and sister. When she
      made the application, she wanted to come for a  visit  for  Christmas.
      She had made a previous visit in 2011 and had  returned  in  May  2011
      with her son. Her husband had been in Thailand from June  to  December
      2012. If she returned she would not be able to stay with anyone.  They
      had stayed in Bangkok in an apartment rented by her husband.  She  had
      no one in Thailand and would not be able to go to  the  south  of  the
      country; she was scared to live there because of  Muslim  people.  She
      had previously worked in a Tesco's near Bangkok.  She  said  that  her
      husband's family would not be able to help him look after  their  son.
      Her mother was not very well: she had problems with her hip. Initially
      in 2012 they had lived with her but they had now moved out  to  rented
      accommodation.

  17. Mr Arron Jolley gave evidence. He is British. He said  that  he  could
      not look after their child because he had  to  work.  His  mother  had
      arthritis and she would struggle to take care of him. Initially,  when
      he returned to work he had worked on a sub-contracting basis  and  had
      been earning ï¿½18,200. He now had a better income. He would not be able
      to support his wife in Thailand. He could not go with them and pay for
      a house. He said that he had not had the funds to  pay  for  a  spouse
      visa; he had not had the money to pay for it at  the  time.  When  his
      wife was supposed to return to in April 2013, she just  could  not  go
      home. They did not have the money.

  18. In cross examination he said that when the visit visa was obtained  in
      October 2012, he was in Thailand. He had been working  as  an  English
      teacher but had had  financial  difficulties.  His  wife  was  not  in
      contact with her brother and sister and would be destitute on  return.
      He thought when he got back to England that he would be able  to  save
      the money and get a spouse visa but initially he found it difficult to
      get work. His mother had rheumatoid arthritis. He did not  think  that
      his son could be away from his mother. He had a brother in the UK  but
      he worked full time. He said that his son was half  British  and  half
      Thai and it would be hard for him to mix with Thai children because of
      their attitude to him as a mixed race child. He accepted that it could
      be a good living in Thailand if you had money.

   Submissions

  19. Mr Jarvis submitted that the appellant had not been able to  meet  the
      requirements of the Rules.  There  were  detailed  types  of  evidence
      required as set out in Appendix FM-SE. On the evidence produced at the
      hearing, those requirements would not be met. He submitted that whilst
      the judgement in MM (Lebanon) v Secretary of State [14] EWCACIV 985 at
      [130] might indicate a slight deviation  away  from  the  approach  in
      Gulshan, it did not change the thrust of cases such  as  Nagre  [2013]
      EWHC 720 and Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA Civ 558. He  submitted  that  the
      Rules were now not simply the starting point  for  the  assessment  of
      article 8 but were a declaration of how the respondent saw the  public
      interest and a failure to meet the requirements of the Rules  was  now
      of much more significance in the assessment of proportionality. It was
      not simply a case of the appellant being unable  to  meet  the  formal
      requirements of the Rules. She was unable to  rely  on  Appendix  EX.1
      because  her  application  was  made  following  the  grant  of  entry
      clearance as a visitor. It now appeared to be the position  that  when
      that application was made in 2012, it was clear that  the  family  did
      not see their life as being in  Thailand.  Further,  in  October  2012
      other parts of the Rules for entry clearance as a spouse could not  be
      met including the maintenance and English language requirements.  When
      the further application was made in April 2013 the requirements of the
      Rules could still not be met. Essentially it was being argued that the
      appellant could now meet the spirit of the rules but the  requirements
      of FM-SE were not simply technical matters: there were as much part of
      the Immigration Rules as Appendix FM.


  20. He submitted that the issue  was  whether  there  were  compelling  or
      exceptional features requiring further consideration under article  8.
      On the issue of the best interests of the child  he  referred  to  the
      judgment in EV  (Philippines)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department) [2014] [EWCA Civ 874] and in particular [30] and  [32]  on
      the importance of  the  child's  position.  It  was  the  respondent's
      argument that the principle in  Chikwamba  was  now  of  very  limited
      application. This was not a case where the  only  requirement  of  the
      Rules which could not be met was a procedural requirement of having to
      make the application from abroad. The appellant was unable to  meet  a
      number of substantive requirements. It was not unreasonable to  expect
      the appellant in the circumstance of this  application  to  return  to
      Thailand to make an application in accordance with the Rules supported
      by the evidence specified.

  21. Mr Garrod submitted that the  provisions  of  s.55  of  the  2009  Act
      provided the compelling circumstances under article 8. The  importance
      of the interests of a child was apparent  from  the  judgment  of  the
      Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania) v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department and Zoumbas [2013] [2014] UKSC 74. The  primary  issue  was
      the impact of s.55 on the application of article 8.  The  relationship
      between the Rules and the appellant's  circumstances  were  subsidiary
      issues. The intention when the appellant and her husband  returned  to
      this country was that he would be able to  earn  sufficient  money  so
      that she could afford to apply to join  him.  He  submitted  that  the
      Rules did not make  provision  enabling  someone  in  the  appellant's
      situation to meet the right requirements. If the child  returned  with
      appellant to Thailand, they would be in a very difficult situation. If
      he remained with his father in  the  UK,  he  would  suffer  by  being
      separated from his mother and his father would have  to  give  up  his
      job. If  they  both  returned  to  Thailand,  the  vicious  circle  of
      struggling to meet the requirements of the Rules would start again.


  22. He submitted that  as  at  the  date  of  the  hearing  there  was  no
      legitimate purpose in requiring the appellant to return to Thailand as
      she could now meet the requirements to  be  granted  leave.   To  this
      extent the principle in Chikwamba  was  engaged.  The  effect  of  the
      decision on their son and her husband  must  be  properly  taken  into
      account in the light  of  Beoku-Betts  v  Secretary  of  State  [2008]
      UKHL39. The facts in EV(Philippines) could be  properly  distinguished
      as the child in the present case was a British Citizen. He argued that
      the circumstances of the  family  could  properly  be  categorised  as
      compelling and exceptional when the best interests of their  son  were
      considered as a primary consideration.


   Consideration of the Issues


  23. The chronology and the primary facts set out in [2] above are  not  in
      issue. I have no doubt that this is a genuine and subsisting  marriage
      and there is now a child of the family born on 21  January  2011.  The
      marriage took place in Thailand on 28 September 2010 and their son was
      born there by which time his father had returned to the UK. There  was
      a visit by the appellant and their son in December 2011 and they  duly
      returned in May 2012. A month later her husband  went  there  for  six
      months and obtained work as an English teacher. In December  2012  the
      appellant applied for and obtained entry clearance as a  visitor.  The
      application is at 1A at 28-37. At questions 11-14, the appellant  said
      she intended to stay with her husband and family for  10  weeks.  They
      intended to travel on 15 November 2012 and return on 27 February 2013.
      She acknowledged in the application that the information she had given
      was complete and true to the best of her knowledge.


  24.  However, she did not return at the end of her visit but made  an  in-
      country application for leave to remain as spouse. In his evidence her
      husband accepted that he had not had the funds to  pay  for  a  spouse
      visa at the time they left. In  cross  examination  he  said  that  he
      thought that when he got back to England, he could save so  that  they
      could apply for a visa but initially he  found  it  difficult  to  get
      work. Both the appellant and her husband have said that there would be
      problems in returning  to  Thailand:  the  appellant  would  not  have
      property to return to and she is not in contact with her  brother  and
      sister. Concerns have been raised  about  the  security  situation  in
      Thailand and the extent to which their son would be  able  to  fit  in
      with Thai children.


  25. It is conceded in this appeal  that  the  appellant  cannot  meet  the
      requirements of the Rules as amended in July 2012. She is not able  to
      take advantage of Appendix EX.1 because she was  unable  to  meet  the
      immigration  status  requirements  set  out   in   E-LTRP.2.1(a).   In
      accordance with the guidance in MF (Nigeria) and Nagre, the issue then
      becomes whether there are  exceptional  and  compelling  circumstances
      requiring a consideration of article 8 outside the  rules.  It  is  in
      this context that the provisions of s55 must be  taken  into  account.
      The best interests of their son are a primary consideration:  see  the
      judgment of the  Court  of  Appeal  in  ZH  (Tanzania).  The  relevant
      principles were restated by the Supreme Court in Zoumbas. The Court in
      [10] adopted and paraphrased the legal principles as follows:

             "1. The best interests of a child are an integral part of  the
             proportionality assessment under article 8 ECHR;
               2. In making that assessment, the best interests of a  child
             must be a primary consideration, although not always the  only
             primary consideration; and the child's best interests  do  not
             of themselves have the status of the paramount consideration;
               3. Although the best interests of a child can be  outweighed
             by the cumulative effect of  other  considerations,  no  other
             consideration can be treated as inherently more significant;
               4. While different judges might approach the question of the
             best interests of the child in different ways, it is important
             to ask oneself the right questions in  an  orderly  manner  in
             order to avoid the risk that the best interests of child might
             be undervalued when other important interests were in play;
               5. It is important  to  have  a  clear  idea  of  a  child's
             circumstances and what is in a child's best  interests  before
             one asks oneself whether those interests are outweighed by the
             force of other considerations;
              6.  To  that  end  there  is  no  substitute  for  a  careful
             examination for all relevant factors when the interests  of  a
             child are involved in article 8 assessments; and a child  must
             not be  blamed  for  matters  for  which  he  or  she  is  not
             responsible, such as the conduct of a parent."

  26. The appellant's son is now aged 3 years 6 months; he has always  lived
      with his mother and has lived with both mother and father  since  June
      2012 initially in Thailand and then in the UK. The family  still  live
      together, his father is working and supporting them and his mother  is
      his primary carer. It is clearly in his best interests for him to live
      in a family unit with his mother and father. That could be  in  either
      Thailand or the UK but I must take into account the fact that he is  a
      British citizen which brings with it important benefits  such  as  the
      right of abode and a right to future education and health care.  These
      are important factors to be taken into account.


  27. I must also take into account and give weight to  the  fact  that  the
      appellant  has  not  been  able  to  meet  the  requirements  of   the
      immigration rules. I have had concerns about whether  the  visit  visa
      was used as a device to gain entry to the UK  in  circumstances  where
      the family could not meet the  requirements  of  the  Rules.  However,
      taking into  account  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge's  findings  on
      credibility, I accept that the  intention  was  that  the  appellant's
      husband hoped to obtain employment and earn  the  money  to  meet  the
      requirements of the rules and make  a  spouse  application,  but  that
      their intentions changed when they began to settle down in the UK.

  28. It is argued with some justification on behalf of the  appellant  that
      the family are in an impossible position. If they return  together  to
      Thailand, her husband would have to give up his job and she  would  be
      unable to meet the requirements of the Rules. If their son stays  with
      him in the UK and the appellant returns, he would have to give up work
      to look after him. If his son returns with the appellant to  Thailand,
      he would not be able to support them. Whilst I do not think  that  the
      position is impossible in the sense that it could not  be  overcome  I
      find that there would be real difficulties which  would  not  make  it
      reasonable to expect the family to return together to Thailand or  for
      their son to remain with one or other parent whilst an application  is
      made for entry clearance. If the appellant returns  to  Thailand  with
      their son, her husband's  finances  would  be  severely  stretched  by
      having to provide support and maintenance for them there and  his  son
      would be separated from him. If their son remains with him in the  UK,
      I accept that it  would  impact  on  his  earning  capacity  and  more
      significantly there would be a considerable emotional impact in  their
      son being separated from his mother. If the family return together  to
      Thailand, the family would no longer be in  a  position  to  meet  the
      financial requirements of the Rules.


  29.  Therefore, whilst the appellant is not able to rely on the provisions
      of para EX1 when the matter is  considered  within  the  Rules,  these
      factors inevitably fall for consideration when the position  is  such,
      as in the  present  case,  that  there  are  compelling  circumstances
      requiring a further consideration outside the Rules under article 8. I
      am satisfied that there  is  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
      between the appellant and her son and this  has  not  been  contested.
      Further, for the reasons I have outlined I am not satisfied that  this
      is a case where it would be reasonable to expect their son  to  return
      to Thailand either with his mother or both parents. The best interests
      of the child of the family outweigh the public interest considerations
      in maintaining effective immigration control in this particular  case.
      After the hearing the provisions of s.19 of the Immigration  Act  2014
      came into force introducing new provisions (s117A-117D) into part 5 of
      the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002.  These  provide  at
      s117B (6) that

      "In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the  public
      interest does not require the person's removal where-


      (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with
      a qualifying child, and
      (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the United
      Kingdom."


  30. The appellant's son is a British citizen and is therefore a qualifying
      child and for the reasons I have given I  am  not  satisfied  that  it
      would be reasonable to  expect  him  to  leave  the  UK.  As  the  new
      statutory provisions confirm the view I had already reached,  this  is
      not a case where there is any need for  the  appeal  to  relisted  for
      further consideration.


   Decision


  31. The First-Tier Tribunal erred in law and the  decision  has  been  set
      aside. I substitute a  decision  allowing  the  appeal  on  article  8
      grounds against the decision refusing the appellant leave to remain as
      a spouse and the decision to remove her.
