                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Kube, of Salam & Co. Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Home Office Presenting Officer.

Points obtained "under paragraphs 113-120 of Appendix A" to the Rules are
not so obtained if paragraph 120A prevents them being obtained.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan.  He has  been  in  the  United
    Kingdom as a student since February 2008.  On 31 May 2012  he  made  an
    application for further leave as a Tier 4  (General)  Student  Migrant.
    His application was refused on 22 October 2012 on the ground  that  his
    proposed studies as described in his  Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for
    Studies (CAS) did not represent academic progression from his  previous
    study.  The appellant's appeal against that decision to the  First-tier
    Tribunal  was  dismissed  by  Judge  Fisher.   He  now  appeals,   with
    permission, to this Tribunal.

 2. The Secretary of State's  decision  when  originally  made  included  a
    simultaneous decision to give removal  directions  under  s.47  of  the
    Immigration,  Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006.   As  Judge   Fisher
    indicated, that decision cannot survive Ahmadi v SSHD [2012] UKUT 00147
    (IAC) and Adamally and Jaferi v SSHD [2012] UKUT  00414  (IAC).   Judge
    Fisher allowed the appeal in respect of the s.47 decision.  No  further
    issue arises on it.

 3. So far as the decision in relation to further leave is  concerned,  the
    relevant parts of the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules, HC 395
    (as amended), are as follows.  The Rules for Tier 4 (General)  Students
    begin at paragraph 245ZT.  The requirements for leave to remain are set
    out in paragraph 245ZX, and one of them, at sub-paragraph (c) is:


          "The applicant must have a minimum of 30 points  under  paragraphs
          113-120 of Appendix A".

 4. Paragraphs 113 to 120 of Appendix A are  to  the  effect  that  the  30
    points are  available,  and  only  available,  for  a  Confirmation  of
    Acceptance for Studies.  Paragraphs 113-115 and  Table  16  state  that
    requirement in simple, though long-winded  terms.   Paragraphs  115-120
    are notes qualifying that requirement.  They are complex and we do  not
    need to refer to them in details.  Paragraph 120  is  now  followed  by
    paragraph 120  -  SD.   That  paragraph  specifies  what  is  meant  by
    "specified documents" in paragraphs 118-120.  It was inserted  from  20
    July 2012, after the present appellant made his application: it is  not
    said to apply to this appeal.  The next paragraph  is  paragraph  120A.
    At the date of the appellant's application paragraph  120A  immediately
    followed paragraph 120.  The history of paragraph 120A is complex.   It
    began as paragraph 120B, being preceded by another  paragraph  numbered
    120A.  That was on 21 April 2011.  It was inserted by HC 1148, and took
    effect from that date, save in respect of  applications  made  but  not
    decided before that date.   On  6  April  2012  it  was  amended.   The
    paragraph that immediately prior to that date had  carried  the  number
    120A was deleted and the present paragraph was renumbered (or rather re-
    lettered) to reflect that omission.   Again,  the  changes  which  took
    place on 6 April 2012, under the authority of HC 1888, did  not  affect
    applications made but not decided before that date.  Further amendments
    were made on 20 July 2012 by Cm 8423.  These amendments have particular
    relevance to the present case, because they  include  a  definition  of
    academic progress.  On this occasion there was no  provision  that  the
    changes were to have no effect on applications made before the date  of
    the amendment.

 5. The appellant's application was made, as we have said, on 31 May  2012,
    and decided on 22 October 2012.  The date of the application was  after
    6 April 2012, and the date of the decision was after 20 July 2012.   It
    follows that the relevant form of paragraph 120A is,  for  all  present
    purposes, that in effect after 20 July 2012.  It is as follows:

          "120A. (a) Points will only be awarded for a valid Confirmation of
          Acceptance for Studies (even if all the requirements in paragraphs
          116 to 120A above are met) if the sponsor has confirmed  that  the
          course for which the Confirmation of Acceptance  for  Studies  has
          been assigned represents academic progress from previous study  as
          defined in (b) below undertaken during the last period of leave as
          a Tier 4 (General) student or as a student,  where  the  applicant
          has had such leave except where:
              (i) the applicant  is  re-sitting  examinations  or  repeating
               modules in accordance with paragraph 119 above, or
             (ii) the applicant is making a first application to move  to  a
               new institution to complete a course commenced elsewhere.
          (b) For a course to  represent  academic  progress  from  previous
               study, the course must:
              (i) be above the level of the previous course  for  which  the
               applicant was granted leave as a Tier 4 (General) Student or
               as a Student, or
             (ii) involve further study at the same level, which the Tier  4
               Sponsor confirms as complementing the  previous  course  for
               which the applicant was granted leave as a Tier 4  (General)
               Student or as a Student".

 6. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Kube does not suggest that the  Cm  8423
    amendments should not apply.  Indeed, it is difficult  to  see  how  he
    could have made that  submission  in  the  light  of  the  authorities,
    particularly Odelola v SSHD [2009] UKHL 25.   Rather,  Mr  Kube  argues
    that the appellant was not required to comply with  paragraph  120A  at
    all.  His argument is neatly encapsulated in the grant of permission:

          "The application contends that the judge was not entitled to  deny
          the  appellant  points,  as  he  did  at  paragraph   9   of   his
          determination, by reference to paragraph 120A of Appendix A to the
          Immigration Rules because paragraph 245ZX(c) of the Rules required
          the applicant to have a points minimum under  "paragraphs  113  to
          120 of Appendix A", without there being any reference to paragraph
          120A of the Appendix".

 7. Mr Kube took us through the history of paragraphs  113-120,  and  120A.
    He  was  able  without  difficulty  to  show  a   certain   amount   of
    prevarication, and at least one error: the reference to "paragraphs 116-
    120A above" must be a relic  of  the  time  when  the  paragraph  under
    consideration was 120B.  With the greatest respect,  however,  none  of
    this assists in showing that paragraph  120A  does  not  apply  to  the
    appellant's case.

 8. Paragraph 120A applies to the appellant's case, not  because  paragraph
    120A is to be taken as included in the phrase "under paragraphs 113  to
    120 of Appendix A" in paragraph 245ZX, but because  paragraph  120A  is
    itself a part of the Rules and, where it applies, prevents points being
    accumulated under paragraphs 113 to 120.  It  would  have  that  effect
    wherever  it  stood  in  the  Rules,  and  the  fact  that  it  happens
    immediately to follow paragraph 120 is irrelevant.  The Rules  have  to
    be read as a whole.  It is not open to an applicant or appellant to say
    that a paragraph of the Rules of general application, does not apply in
    his case.  The appellant needed to obtain points under  paragraphs  113
    to 120 of Appendix A.  He could only do so under  the  Rules,  and  the
    Rules require progress to be shown in order  for  those  points  to  be
    obtained.

 9. Mr Kube's second point was  that  if  paragraph  120A  did  apply,  its
    requirements  were  met,  because  the  appellant's  new  course  would
    represent academic progress from  his  previous  study.   His  previous
    study was at NQF/QCF Level 4, whereas the proposed study was  at  level
    5.

10. That argument, which might have been  open  to  the  appellant  if  the
    amendments under Cm 8423 had not applied to him, is clearly not open on
    the basis of paragraph 120A as amended.  The question is not the actual
    level of his previous studies, but the level "of  the  previous  course
    for which the applicant  was  granted  leave  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student".  Although it appears that the appellant only completed  Level
    4, it is clear that he was in April 2009 granted leave in respect of  a
    three year course comprising Levels 4, 5 and 6.  In  fact  he  did  not
    complete Level 4 until January 2012, by  which  time  the  college  had
    discontinued  the  course  structure  under  which  the  appellant  had
    originally enrolled.  His new  enrolment  was  for  Level  5.   As  the
    college indicates, "this is  at  a  higher  level  than  his  completed
    course"; but it is not at a higher level than the course on  the  basis
    of which he was previously granted leave: that was a course which would
    have taken him beyond Level 5.  It follows  that  the  appellant's  new
    course did not meet the requirements of paragraph 120A of  Appendix  A;
    and he was therefore entitled to no  points  for  his  Confirmation  of
    Acceptance for Studies.

11. It is accordingly clear that the decisions of the  Secretary  of  State
    and the First-tier Tribunal to that effect were  correct.   The  First-
    tier Tribunal made no error of law.  We dismiss the appellant's appeal.
