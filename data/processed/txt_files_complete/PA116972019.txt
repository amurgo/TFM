                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
        Tribunal Judge Sills ('the Judge') promulgated on 11 February  2021
        in which the Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal on all grounds.
     2. This Initial Hearing, to enable the  Upper  Tribunal  to  establish
        whether the Judge had erred in law in  a  manner  material  to  the
        decision to dismiss the appeal, was conducted as a  hybrid  hearing
        with myself and the appellant in  court  and  with  both  advocates
        connecting remotely. I am satisfied that the appellant  received  a
        fair hearing of his appeal.

Background

     3. The appellant is a citizen of Iran of Kurdish ethnicity, born on  9
        December 1995. The appellant claims to have left Iran on 25 October
        2017, to have travelled on foot to Turkey, and then  through  Italy
        and France, before arriving in the UK on 15 December 2017.
     4. The Judge,  who  had  the  benefit  of  considering  not  only  the
        documentary evidence but also seeing and hearing the appellant give
        oral evidence, sets out findings of fact from [14] of the  decision
        under challenge.
     5. The Judge sets out the basis of the appellant's claim at [3]  which
        is summarised in the following terms:

        a) Your name is IAM and you were born in Iran.


        b) In 2017, you discussed your families' money  problems  with  two
           friends and they explained to you that you could earn  money  by
           smuggling goods over the Iran border.


        c) You were introduced to a man called QM who you agreed to smuggle
           for.


        d) You began smuggling alcohol and KDPI papers into Iran for QM.


        e) Each time you  smuggled  for  Q,  he  would  return  your  birth
           certificate to ensure you did not steal any of his goods.


        f) On 23 October 2017, after returning from the  Iraq  border  with
           alcohol and KDPI papers, you are  ambushed  by  members  of  the
           Iranian Government.


        g) You fled the scene immediately and ran to a remote area  by  the
           Iraq border before returning to your family home the next day.


        h) You explained to your father what had happened  and  he  advised
           you to leave and arranged for you to go to your uncles.


        i) That day the Iranian  Government  attended  your  parents  [sic]
           houses as they had arrested Q at the scene  and  in  turn  found
           your birth certificate which you had retained.


        j) The Iranian Government searched your village and  house  looking
           for you.

     6. At [25] the Judge writes:

        25.  I have carefully considered all the evidence in the round,  in
             line  with  the  guidance  from  the  case  of  Ravichandran  v
             Secretary of State the Home Department [1996]  Imm  AR  97  and
             Karanakaran v SSHD [2000] EWCA Civ 11. I have applied the lower
             standard of proof,  with  the  burden  upon  the  Appellant.  I
             accepted that aspects of the Appellant's account are plausible.
             However, I consider that there are  fundamental  flaws  in  key
             elements of the Appellant's case. I consider that  the  country
             information relied upon by the Respondent to  the  effect  that
             KDPI  flyers  are  designed  in  Iraq  but  printed   in   Iran
             immediately  before  distribution  undermines  the  Appellant's
             claim to be transported printed flyers from Iraq to Iran. I  do
             not  accept  that  Q  would  gain  anything  by   holding   the
             Appellant's birth certificate while he was on a job.  All  this
             practice would do would be to make  it  more  likely  that  all
             those working for Q would be caught if he was caught. I do  not
             accept that a smuggling operation would operate in this manner.
             I do not consider the Appellant has given a credible account of
             the ambush by the authorities, namely that the authorities drew
             attention to themselves by shooting in the air before they were
             in a position to arrest all the smugglers. It is  not  credible
             that after fleeing Iran and crossing into Iraq,  the  Appellant
             would return home without first seeking the assistance  of  the
             KDPI who he claims to have been assisting to establish what had
             happened and the danger he faced on return.  I  do  not  accept
             that the Appellant  would  leave  Iran  without  any  means  of
             communicating with his family. For these reasons  I  find  that
             the core of the Appellant's account of events in  Iran  is  not
             credible. I do not  accept  that  the  Appellant  worked  as  a
             Kolber. I do not  accept  that  he  smuggled  alcohol  or  KDPI
             flyers. I do not accept that he and his group were ambushed  by
             the authorities.  I  do  not  accept  that  Q  held  his  birth
             certificate. I do not accept that the authorities  have  raised
             his home. I do not accept that the Appellant has  come  to  the
             attention of the authorities. In view of these findings,  I  do
             not accept that  the  Appellant  left  Iran  illegally.  Taking
             account of these findings, and the timing of  the  commencement
             of  his  political  activity  and  its  limited  extent,  I  am
             satisfied that the Appellant's political activism is  motivated
             not by genuine political belief, but by his wish to  remain  in
             the UK.

     7. Having considered the country guidance on risk  on  return  and  in
        light of the earlier findings, the Judge found  the  appellant  had
        not established a real risk as a failed asylum seeker  as  per  SSH
        and HR (legal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran CG [2016]  UKUT  308
        [29], nor in accordance with HB (Kurds), Iran CG [2018] UKUT  00430
        (IAC) as it was  not  found  that  the  appellant's  attendance  at
        demonstrations in the United Kingdom and posting of online  footage
        would have come to attention of the authorities [30], or  that  the
        appellant's Facebook account had  come  to  the  attention  of  the
        authorities in Iran, and  by  reference  to  BA  (Demonstrators  in
        Britain - risk on return) Iran CG [2011] UKUT 36 (IAC) such  as  to
        create  a  real  risk  on  the  basis  the  appellant's   political
        activities being at a very low level and the appellant  not  having
        established that it was reasonably likely he had put his family  in
        Iran at risk or come to the adverse attention of the authorities.
     8. The Judge considered the issue of heightened scrutiny on return but
        did not find risk arose for the appellant.  It  was  found  by  the
        Judge that at the 'pinch point' the appellant could be asked  about
        the basis of his asylum claim and that if the appellant  stated  he
        falsely claimed to be a Kolber (smuggler) and to  have  transported
        leaflets it would not put him at risk [34]. The Judge  accepts  the
        appellant could be asked if he had taken part in any demonstrations
        or ever posted any critical message against the regime  online  but
        found that the appellant would deny having done so and did not find
        there was a real risk the Iranian authorities would  discover  that
        the appellant had in fact attended such demonstrations  and  posted
        critical messages if he denied having done so when questioned [35].
     9. The Judge considered the  HJ  (Iran)  point,  and  whether  it  was
        permissible to expect the appellant to lie about what he  had  been
        doing United Kingdom, after which it is written at [39]:

        39.   I  consider  that  these  passages  highlight  an   important
             distinction  between  the   Appellant's   case   in   HJ   Iran
             encapsulated. A key question highlighted in HJ Iran was the why
             question, namely, why would an individual act discreetly. In my
             view, the key question concerning the  Appellant  is  the  what
             question.  What  must  the   Appellant   concealed   to   avoid
             persecution. In contrast to HJ Iran and RT, the Appellant  does
             not need to conceal any race, religion, nationality, membership
             of a social group or political opinion  to  avoid  persecution.
             The Appellant has not established that he holds any  particular
             political  opinion.  I  have  not  accepted   the   Appellant's
             attendance at demonstrations or social media posts reflect  any
             genuinely  held  political  opinion.  The  'price'   that   the
             Appellant must pay is to conceal  opportunistic  attendance  at
             demonstrations and social media posts motivated solely  by  the
             wish to be granted refugee status in the UK. The  Appellant  is
             not required to conceal a characteristic or status that  cannot
             be changed,  or  he  cannot  be  expected  to  change.  In  the
             Appellant's  case,  the   necessary   modification   to   avoid
             persecution does not involve surrendering  his  right  to  live
             freely and openly in society as to who he is, in terms  of  the
             protected characteristic. I do not consider that when construed
             in light of its objects and  purpose,  the  HJ  Iran  principle
             applies to this Appellant. I do not accept that the protections
             of the Refugee Convention apply to the Appellant.  I  therefore
             find that the Appellant has not faced a  well-founded  fear  of
             persecution for a  Convention  reason  on  return  to  Iran.  I
             dismiss  the  appeal  on  asylum   grounds.   Any   appeal   on
             humanitarian protection and human rights  grounds,  stands  and
             falls with the asylum on asylum grounds.

    10. The appellant sought permission to  appeal  which  was  granted  by
        another judge of the First-tier Tribunal, the relevant part of  the
        grant being in the following terms:

        2.   Having read the decision of the judge I note  that  there  are
             contradictory findings of fact with regards to the  claim  that
             the Appellant was employed as a Kolber  smuggling  alcohol.  As
             rightly  pointed  out  by  the  grounds  there  is   a   direct
             contradiction with  the  assessment  at  paragraph  17  of  the
             determination  where  the  judge  stated  "I  note   that   the
             Appellant's oral evidence about what he smuggled and  when  was
             reasonably consistent with his earlier evidence" when  compared
             to the findings at paragraph 25 where the judge found  "I  find
             that the core of the Appellant's account of events in  Iran  is
             not credible. I do not accept that the Appellant  worked  as  a
             Kolber. I do not  accept  that  he  smuggled  alcohol  or  KDPI
             flyers".


        3.   In view of these contradictory findings on core aspects of the
             Appellant's claim, which are  related  to  his  claim  to  have
             assisted with KDPI flyers, it is arguable that the findings  of
             fact of the judge are not safe with regard you should have risk
             on return. In view of the legal error of the judge with regards
             to the credibility issue permission to appeal is granted.

    11. The appellant  relied  on  two  grounds  of  appeal,  claiming  the
        assessment  of  the  appellant's  evidence   regarding   his   past
        employment as a Kolber lacked detail and was based upon  inadequate
        findings for the reasons set out below in [4 - 11] of the  grounds,
        and also erred in that the findings in relation to the  appellant's
        sur place activities were flawed for the reasons stated  at  [12  -
        15] of the grounds.

Error of law

    12. The Judge's findings at [25] are set out above. At [17]  the  Judge
        wrote:

        17.  I consider it is plausible that the Appellant  would  turn  to
             smuggling due to his family's  economic  circumstances.  It  is
             also plausible that he would begin  working  with  his  friends
             contact, Q. 60 - 70kgs strikes me as a rather heavy loads to be
             carrying across remote tracks for 3 � hours at a  time,  but  I
             accept this may be an innocent overstatement. If the goods were
             loaded in boxes I accept the Appellant may not have been  aware
             of  precisely  what  type  of  alcohol  he  was  carrying.  The
             Appellant was also able to name border crossing routes  at  his
             asylum interview. While not corroborated, this level of  detail
             suggests knowledge of the area. I  note  that  the  Appellant's
             oral evidence about what he smuggled and  when  was  reasonably
             consistent with his earlier evidence.

    13. I do not find it made out that the  Judge  has  made  contradictory
        findings sufficient to amount to material legal error. At [17]  the
        Judge was commenting upon aspects of the evidence which  themselves
        were found to be plausible and giving the appellant the benefit  of
        the doubt with regard to other aspects mentioned.  It  is  at  [25]
        that the Judge draws together the threads of his thinking,  leading
        to it being found that the appellant is not a credible witness, for
        which sufficient reasons have been given.
    14. The Judge clearly considered the evidence with the required  degree
        of anxious scrutiny, and it is clear why the Judge arrived  at  the
        conclusions set out in the decision.
    15. Whilst at the hearing reference was made to what was  described  as
        detailed evidence in the asylum interview and before the First-tier
        Tribunal by Mr Abdullah, that material was  clearly  considered  by
        the Judge, and it has not been established  to  the  contrary.  The
        argument advanced  by  Mr  Abdullah  that  the  Judge  should  have
        accepted the same does not establish  arguable  legal  error.  That
        submission is, in effect, a disagreement with the weight the  Judge
        gave to the evidence and an argument that  the  Judge  should  have
        given greater weight to the appellant's claim, resulting in a  more
        favourable outcome. The  fact  the  appellant  disagrees  with  the
        outcome does not mean the evidence was not properly considered.
    16. In addition to the evidence  from  the  appellant,  the  Judge  had
        country evidence which was also considered. The Judge's concerns in
        relation to what the appellant alleged  occurred  when  he  claimed
        they were encountered by the border guards at [20-21]  are  clearly
        within the  range  of  findings  available  to  the  Judge  on  the
        evidence.
    17. Mr Abdullah in his submissions repeated his claim that the findings
        were not supported  by  adequate  reasons,  but  a  reader  of  the
        determination is able to understand  why  the  Judge  came  to  the
        conclusions that have been recorded. The reasons  provided  by  the
        Judge are adequate.
    18. In relation to risk on return, Mr Abdullah  submitted  the  Judge's
        findings were not safe for even though the appellant had been found
        to have fabricated his activities in the United Kingdom they  could
        still give rise to real risk. Reliance was placed upon the position
        of Kurds in Iran.
    19. Mr Diwnycz referred to the 2019 CPIN in the public domain  relating
        to smugglers in Iran and submitted that even though  the  appellant
        may know what happens in his home area in Iran this did not mean he
        undertook such activities himself.
    20. I accept the submission of Mr Diwnycz that even if an  account  had
        been found to be  plausible  it  did  not  mean  it  was  credible,
        especially if the evidence considered as a whole suggested  it  was
        not, which is the situation in this appeal.
    21. The Judge was not required to set out each and every aspect of  the
        evidence provided and relied upon, nor to make findings  upon  each
        and every  point  raised.  To  do  so  would  have  resulted  in  a
        considerably lengthier document, the outcome of which was likely to
        be the same.
    22. Whilst the appellant disagrees with  the  outcome  and  seeks  more
        favourable conclusions, the grounds  fail  to  establish  that  the
        Judge's decision to dismiss the appeal  is  outside  the  range  of
        findings reasonably open to the Judge on the  evidence;  especially
        in light of the current available country information.
    23. I do not find the appellant has established legal error material to
        the decision to dismiss the appeal sufficient to warrant the  Upper
        Tribunal interfering any further in this matter.

Decision

    24. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.

   Anonymity.

    25. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

        I make such order pursuant to rule 14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
