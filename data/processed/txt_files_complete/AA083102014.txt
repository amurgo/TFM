Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Claimant: Ms G Peterson, Counsel instructed by Supreme Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Robinson allowing the  Claimant's  appeal  on
    human rights grounds with reference to  Article  8  ECHR,  against  her
    decision to refuse her asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights
    claim and against removal directions set for the Claimant's country  of
    origin, Nigeria.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Robinson  dismissed  the  grounds  of  appeal
    concerning asylum and Article 3 ECHR but allowed the  appeal  on  human
    rights grounds with reference to Article 8 ECHR on the basis  that  the
    decision was  a  disproportionate  interference  with  her  family  and
    private life.

 3. The Appellant appealed  against  that  decision.  The  grounds  may  be
    summarised as follows:

      i) The judge erred in deciding there are reasons  to  go  outside  the
         Immigration Rules, because the appellant is in receipt  of  medical
         care and is dependent on relatives in the UK,  the  judge  did  not
         state that treatment was not available in Nigeria but said that the
         societal prejudice in Nigeria may make it difficult to  access  the
         care she needs (see paragraph 73 of the decision);

     ii) The judge has not reconciled his negative credibility  findings  in
         relation to the asylum claim in finding that the  family  situation
         in Nigeria is as stated.

 4. The Appellant was granted permission to appeal by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Levin by way of a decision which stated inter alia as follows:

         "Given that the Judge found that Article 3  of  the  ECHR  was  not
         breached on  medical  grounds  it  is  arguable  that  the  Judge's
         decision to allow the Appeal under Article 8 on medical grounds  is
         flawed having regard to the judgment of the Court of Appeal  in  GS
         (India) and others [2015] EWCA Civ 40. It is also arguable that the
         Judge erred in failing to have regard to the  factors  set  out  in
         section 117B of the 2002 Act in his assessment of  the  Appellant's
         appeal on Article 8 grounds. For these reasons both the grounds and
         the decision disclose arguable errors of law".

 5. I should observe that neither the GS (India) point nor the section 117B
    point were taken by the Appellant in her grounds seeking permission and
    were not said to be Robinson obvious either. It is unclear  to  me  how
    the original grounds correlate to those  two  new  points;  however  as
    permission was granted on that basis, I entertained submissions on  the
    grounds as well as Judge Levin's grant.

 6. I was not provided with a Rule 24 response from the Claimant.

    Submissions

 7. In advancing the Secretary of State's grounds of appeal,  Ms  Isherwood
    submitted inter alia that the judge  did  not  find  the  asylum  claim
    credible (see paragraph 45) and that the  Reasons  for  Refusal  Letter
    claimed that other family members remained in Nigeria (at paragraphs 5,
    6, 43, 89, 93 of that Letter), which the judge  failed  to  resolve  at
    paragraph 67 of the decision.  Consequently,  the  Appellant  submitted
    there is support available  in  Nigeria  to  the  Claimant  and  having
    refused the asylum claim, the judge should have found that  there  were
    family members remaining in Nigeria. Ms Isherwood submitted that  GS  &
    EO (Article 3 - health cases) India [2012] UKUT 397 (IAC) mentions  the
    burden on the state and the public interest as  matters  that  must  be
    considered and given the Appellant's immigration history and her  being
    an overstayer, she could not benefit from  the  decision  in  GS.  Miss
    Isherwood also pled reliance upon the first headnote in Akhalu  (health
    claim: ECHR Article 8) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 400 (IAC)  which  reaffirmed
    the ratio in MM (Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2012] EWCA Civ 279, that  the  countervailing  public  interest  is  a
    material consideration of central importance which  will  outweigh  the
    adverse consequences for a claimant's health due to disparity of health
    care facilities in all but a very few rare cases. Finally, Ms Isherwood
    also pled reliance upon section 117B of the  2002  Act,  as  raised  by
    Judge Levin and submitted that the judge had not taken into account the
    burden on the state  and  there  was  no  evidence  to  show  financial
    independence and payment for medical treatment.

 8. I then heard submissions from Ms Peterson who submitted in reply  inter
    alia that she relied on [51-52] of Akhalu confirming that the Article 8
    analysis is a fact-based assessment.  As  counsel  instructed  in  this
    matter at the First-tier Tribunal, Ms  Peterson  highlighted  that  the
    judge had the benefit of hearing all the evidence and  making  his  own
    independent observations. Evidence was  given  family  members  of  the
    Appellant. For example, the Appellant's uncle had confirmed in his oral
    evidence that he had supported her throughout her childhood. Similarly,
    his witness statement stated that he was  unaware  of  the  Appellant's
    remaining family in Nigeria. Ms Peterson emphasised that the  disparity
    of medical treatment between that received here and that  available  in
    Nigeria was not an argument advanced by the Appellant but on the  basis
    of Article 8 ECHR. In reply to Judge Levin's grant of permission, I was
    reminded that GS (India)  was  in  fact  mentioned  explicitly  in  the
    judge's decision and GS (India) referred to the point in MM  (Zimbabwe)
    in respect of Article 8 arguments. She highlighted that the judge  made
    suitable findings on all issues challenged by the Secretary of State at
    paragraphs 61, 66 and 68-71. Ms Peterson submitted that [111]  of  Lord
    Justice Underhill's judgment in GS (India) (which sets out [23]  of  MM
    (Zimbabwe) in turn) affirms that the health provisions in the receiving
    country cannot be a  determinative  factor  but  are  a  factor  to  be
    considered amongst others and the  absence  or  inadequacy  of  medical
    treatment  in  the  country  of  return  may  be  a   factor   in   the
    proportionality exercise.

 9. Ms Peterson highlighted that the presenting officer at  the  First-tier
    made submissions on section 117B. Ms Peterson submitted that  paragraph
    75 of the decision specifically takes the public interest into account.
    The judge  explicitly  considered  the  consequences  of  weighing  all
    countervailing factors resulting in removal  at  paragraph  75  of  the
    decision; however, on balance, his findings at paragraph 76 demonstrate
    that the judge came down in the Claimant's favour, which was a decision
    that he was entitled to reach having taken the preceding  factors  into
    account. She submitted that the Secretary of State disagreed  with  the
    decision, but  all  the  necessary  factors  were  considered  and  the
    necessary conclusions are set out at paragraph 76. The judge was  aware
    of the public interest and mentions it  at  paragraph  78,  however  he
    explicitly finds that the public interest is  outweighed.  This  is  an
    appeal that consequently succeeded on its own individual circumstances.



10. In response to my query, Ms Peterson confirmed that  the  Appellant  is
    living with her uncle and his wife and is provided with  financial  and
    other support by her family here.

11. In concluding her application, Ms Isherwood submitted  that  the  judge
    finds private life exists from support organisations but the  2002  Act
    says little weight should be given to private life. That is  stated  at
    paragraph 69 but it is not carried through at paragraph 75.

12. I asked both parties at the close of submissions whether they had
    anything further to add and both confirmed that they did not.

    No Error of Law

13. At the close of submissions,  I  indicated  that  I  would  reserve  my
    decision, which I shall now give. I do not find that there was an error
    of law in the decision such that it should be set aside. My reasons for
    so finding are as follows.

14. In relation to the first ground (repeated at paragraph 4(i)  above),  I
    am  satisfied  that  this  ground  amounts  to  nothing  more  than   a
    disagreement with the conclusions reached  and  findings  made  by  the
    judge. There is no perversity or irrationality pointed to in the ground
    itself as originally pled and although Ms Isherwood  did  her  best  to
    address me on parallels between the instant appeal and that  of  Akhalu
    and GS and EO, she was to my mind unable to point to any legal error in
    the judge's reasoning or findings that were not open to  him  to  make.
    The fact that the judge "did not state that treatment was not available
    in Nigeria but said that the societal prejudice in Nigeria may make  it
    difficult to access the care she needs" is not fatal for the claim  and
    in fact in of itself would not be sufficient for  the  appeal  to  have
    succeeded in harmony with Lord Justice Underhill's observations  in  GS
    (India) at [111] in relation to the "no obligation to treat" principle.
    However, the fact remains that the Claimant wisely did not pursue  that
    argument at the First-tier Tribunal, which would  have  been  bound  to
    fail, and so arguments on this issue, which was never  taken,  have  no
    relevance. The fact that the Claimant "is in receipt  of  medical  care
    and is dependent on relatives in  the  UK"  speaks  in  her  favour  as
    factors that take the matter within the Article  8  ambit  and  warrant
    further consideration in terms of the overall  proportionality  of  her
    proposed removal. The judge's assessment of Article 8 being engaged  is
    sufficiently reasoned at paragraph 62 in any  event  and  the  decision
    must be read as a whole.

15.  The  second  ground  concerning  the  credibility  findings  is   also
    misconceived. The judge's findings at paragraph 45  relate  to  a  land
    dispute which led to the murder of the Claimant's father not being made
    out and the conclusion that the claim has been  fabricated  to  explain
    her unlawful stay in the UK. It is important  to  note  the  Claimant's
    immigration history reflected at  paragraph  6  of  the  decision.  She
    arrived in the UK on 27 December 2012 and she  claims  her  father  was
    murdered in Nigeria in January 2013. The conclusion that the father was
    not murdered due  to  a  land  dispute  and  that  she  need  not  have
    overstayed is a discrete factual assessment of the asylum claim. As the
    claim was made to justify her overstaying her visit visa  in  mid-2013,
    this claim is far removed and distinguishable from the  fact  that  she
    fell ill later on and was diagnosed with HIV the next year, in  January
    2014 and started antiretroviral  therapy  in  February  2014.  The  two
    subjects are not necessarily linked and it does not follow that  simply
    because the Claimant fabricated an asylum claim, her  claim  concerning
    family life with her uncle and his wife (being  the  closest  relatives
    she has remaining) should be disbelieved. The judge was very much aware
    of the distinction between these facts as made clear by paragraph 62 of
    his decision.

16. In relation to the passages referred to me by Ms Isherwood showing that
    family support exists in Nigeria, firstly, the Refusal Letter itself at
    ��5-6 acknowledges that the Claimant  has  no  siblings  and  that  her
    mother abandoned her when she was  7  years  old.  The  fact  that  the
    Refusal Letter rehearses the Claimant's answer at  interview  (AIR  50)
    that her father had "many half brothers and sisters" (paragraph 43)  is
    inconsequential when the Letter at paragraph 89 does not  contend  that
    familial support networks are available in Nigeria. The fact  that  the
    Letter at paragraph 93 states that there was no  evidence  provided  of
    any family ties to the UK is irrelevant where the judge in his  opinion
    has independently accepted that the Claimant has a family life with her
    uncle and his wife at �68 of the decision. In any event, none of  those
    factors precludes the judge from making the findings of  fact  that  he
    did.

17. It is perfectly acceptable for a judge to accept specific parts  of  an
    Appellant's  account  and  not  others  pursuant  to  Chiver   (Asylum;
    Discrimination; Employment; Persecution) (Romania) [1994] UKIAT  10758.
    In that same decision, it was  further  observed  by  the  Tribunal  as
    follows:

         "... an appeal Tribunal would be extremely sparing in reviewing  an
         adjudicator's decision as  to  the  credibility  of  a  witness  or
         witnesses whom the  adjudicator  had  seen  or  heard  giving  oral
         evidence and the Tribunal had not" (see Alam Bi v  IAT  [1979-1980]
         Imm AR 146 at p.151)

         ... It is perfectly possible for an adjudicator to believe  that  a
         witness  is  not  telling  the  truth  about  some   matters,   has
         exaggerated the story  to  make  his  case  better,  or  is  simply
         uncertain about matters, but still to be persuaded that the  centre
         piece of the story  stands.  This  is  particularly  so  where  the
         critical criterion for an adjudicator is the reasonable  likelihood
         of persecution occurring were a person to return  to  a  particular
         country".

18. I find that the Judge reached findings upon  the  evidence  before  him
    that were open to him and which he was entitled to reach. It  might  be
    that another judge would not have reached the same conclusion on  those
    facts; however those findings are neither perverse nor irrational in  a
    Wednesbury sense for that reason. In that respect, I remind  myself  of
    the dicta  of  Baroness  Hale  in  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department v AH (Sudan) & Ors [2007] UKHL 49, wherein the following was
    stated inter alia [at 30]:

         "...This is an expert tribunal charged with administering a complex
         area of law in challenging circumstances... and they alone are  the
         judges of the facts. It is not enough that their decision on  those
         facts may seem harsh to people who have  not  heard  and  read  the
         evidence and arguments  which  they  have  heard  and  read.  Their
         decisions should be respected unless it is quite  clear  that  they
         have misdirected themselves in law.  Appellate  courts  should  not
         rush to find such misdirections  simply  because  they  might  have
         reached a different conclusion on the facts or expressed themselves
         differently".

19. Regarding Judge Levin's observations on GS (India) and the  submissions
    made by Ms Isherwood, I find this  ground  is  also  not  made  out  as
    paragraph 31 of the decision makes explicit reference to GS (India) and
    confirms health claims are not barred from success under Article 8 even
    though they may fail to meet the higher threshold of  Article  3.  That
    authority is considered in detail at  paragraph  59  of  the  decision.
    Given the careful and detailed manner in which the  judge  audited  his
    consideration of the competing interests under Article 8  and  did  not
    err by suggesting there was an obligation to treat, but in  fact  noted
    that treatment was available in Nigeria, and that the  public  interest
    is to ensure that the limited resources of the health service  are  for
    the benefit of those for whom  they  are  intended  before  finding  in
    favour of the Claimant due to her family support network that  was  not
    available in Nigeria; the judge was unarguably entitled  to  reach  the
    conclusion that he reached.

20. Finally, in relation to the section 117B issue, it is clear to me  that
    the judge had taken into account  the  burden  on  the  state  and  the
    provision of medical treatment where the Claimant was not  entitled  to
    it. As to the other  section  117B  factors,  I  cannot  see  that  the
    Claimant's ability to speak English and her dependence upon  her  uncle
    and lack of employment would speak against her. The judge's  assessment
    of the public interest in substance is in keeping with the decision  in
    Dube (ss.117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 90 (IAC).

21. Therefore, in conclusion, the grounds do not reveal  an  error  of  law
    such that the decision should be set aside.

22. In the circumstances the appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed  and
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is affirmed.
