                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr R Jesurum, Counsel, instructed by Howe & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants are Paul Gurung and Santosh Gurung.  They  are  brothers
    who are nationals of Nepal. They appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    against the decisions of the respondent of 22 December 2011  to  refuse
    their applications for entry clearance to settle with their father,  Mr
    Baburam Gurung, the sponsor, who was granted settlement in the UK as  a
    Ghurkha Veteran along with his wife and minor  daughter.   The  sponsor
    had entered the UK in April 2011.

2.   The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  on  21  November  2012  dismissed
    their appeals. These were then appealed to the Upper Tribunal and in  a
    decision of the Upper Tribunal dated 22 May 2013 the determination  was
    upheld.

3.   There then followed an appeal to the Court of Appeal and  after  sundry
    procedure  on  11  July  2014  by  consent  it  was  ordered  that  the
    determination  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  22  May   2013   and   the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal of  21  November  2012  should
    both be set aside. The appeal was remitted to the Upper Tribunal to  be
    reheard on the  basis  that  it  was  accepted  that  the  respondent's
    decision is one which engages  Article  8(1)  applying  the  principles
    applicable to Article 8(2) set out  in  Gurung  [2013]  1WLR  2546  and
    Ghising and Others (Ghurkahs/BOCs historic wrong  weight)  [2013]  UKUT
    567 (IAC).

4.   Before us  Mr  Jesurum  for  the  appellant  adhered  to  the  skeleton
    arguments which had  been  submitted.   Mr  Bramble,  the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer, very fairly informed  us  that  the  considerations
    which are set out in paragraph 60 of Ghising, that is to say the public
    interest, going beyond the public interest in the maintenance of a firm
    and fair immigration policy such as a bad  immigration  history  and/or
    criminal behaviour could not be maintained in this case.

6.   That being so, it is clear that the  appeals  in  both  cases  must  be
    allowed and we shall accordingly do so.
