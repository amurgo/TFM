                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The Entry Clearance  Officer  (ECO)  has  been  granted  permission  to
    appeal the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Colvin  allowing  the
    appeal of the respondent against a decision made by the ECO of 16  July
    2013 to refuse him entry clearance as  a  visitor  in  accordance  with
    paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules.

2.   The judge determined the appeal on the papers.  The respondent  applied
    for a visa to visit his 2 year old son who resides with his  mother  in
    the UK for two weeks.  He said that he is divorced from his ex-wife who
    is the child's mother.  In his grounds of appeal he confirmed that  his
    son Arat lives with his mother  in  Birmingham  as  refugees.   It  was
    sixteen months since he had seen  the  child  and  he  had  made  three
    applications which had all been refused.  He permitted his  ex-wife  to
    take his son to the UK as she could not live in Iran.  He  just  wanted
    to see his son and did not want to stay in the UK.

3.   He produced a copy of a Divorce Deed  with  the  translation  dated  19
    June 2013 and a certificate from  the  General  Justice  Department  of
    Tehran dated 2 June 2013 with a translation dated 19 June 2013.

4.   The ECO refused  the  application  because  it  was  unclear  from  the
    documentation when the respondent's ex-wife and child entered  the  UK.
    The divorce certificate dated 8 August 2011 made reference  to  custody
    of his 2� year old son; however the son's date of birth was 25 May 2010
    and therefore at the time of the divorce he would have been 14�  months
    old.  The ECO did not consider that an official document would  contain
    such a large discrepancy regarding the child's age.  This led  the  ECO
    to question the divorce  papers  provided,  the  date  of  the  claimed
    divorce and whether in fact the respondent was divorced at all.

5.    The  ECO  also  considered  that  the  respondent  had   provided   no
    satisfactory documents to demonstrate that he has custody rights to see
    his son as he is divorced.  These factors  undermined  his  credibility
    and the overall credibility of the application.  Added to this, the ECO
    did not consider that  the  respondent's  circumstances  in  Iran  were
    dissimilar to those of his ex-wife and child and given that  they  have
    applied for and been granted refugee status, the ECO was not  satisfied
    that the respondent's intentions were merely that of a visitor.

6.   The judge  had  before  her  further  official  divorce  documents  the
    respondent had submitted which had been  amended  so  as  to  show  the
    correct age of his son at the time of the divorce.  There  was  also  a
    separate  certificate  from  the  Judge  of  the  Tehran  Public  Court
    confirming that the Minutes of the Meeting of the court had  mistakenly
    typed the age of the child which had now  been  corrected.   The  judge
    said there was no submission from the  ECO  to  claim  that  these  new
    documents could not be relied upon.   The judge therefore  accepted  in
    the absence of an objection from the ECO that the respondent's evidence
    that this was a genuine mistake by the original court and it  would  be
    unreasonable to draw an adverse  credibility  finding  against  him  in
    those circumstances.  The judge accepted on the basis of  the  evidence
    that the respondent was divorced as claimed.

7.   The judge considered the ECO's assertion that there was nothing on  the
    face of the divorce document to show that the respondent has any rights
    to visit his son.  She said the documents submitted for this appeal  as
    shown in the ECO's bundle includes the  following  sentence:  "visiting
    for the child is protected (the husband does not  has  (sic)  right  of
    visiting his son)."  The respondent said that  this  sentence  had  not
    been registered as part of the divorce certificate and that his ex-wife
    had sent an invitation letter for him to  visit  his  son.   The  judge
    commented that whilst it was unfortunate that  this  was  not  an  oral
    hearing where the evidence from the  respondent's  ex-wife  might  have
    clarified this  and  other  matters,  she  accepted  on  a  balance  of
    probabilities that the respondent would be able to see his  son  during
    the week's visit to the UK.  His ex-wife had raised the issue that this
    would be in the best interests of the child, a matter that also  needed
    to be considered in this appeal.

8.   The judge also considered  that  the  ECO  had  raised  a  question  of
    whether the respondent was intending to seek refugee status in the  UK,
    like his ex-wife.  She thought it was not reasonably possible to  reach
    a view on this on the evidence that was before her.  The mere fact that
    his ex-wife has done so does not automatically mean that  an  inference
    can  be  drawn  in  relation  to  the  respondent  in  the  absence  of
    substantive evidence indicating that this was likely to be so.  She had
    no information submitted by the  ECO  regarding  the  respondent's  two
    previous applications and refusals.

9.    Taking  all  these  matters  into  account,  the  judge  reached   the
    conclusion that on a balance of probabilities the respondent has  shown
    that he is a genuine visitor who intends to return at the  end  of  the
    visit and therefore fulfils the Immigration Rules.

10.  The grounds submitted on behalf  of  the  ECO  argued  that  the  judge
    failed to place any weight, without adequate reasons on the document in
    the respondent's bundle which includes the sentence "visiting the child
    is protected (the husband does not has  (sic)  right  of  visiting  his
    son)", instead preferring the  paper  evidence  of  the  respondent  in
    finding that "this sentence has not been  registered  as  part  of  the
    divorce certificate and that his ex-wife has  sent  him  an  invitation
    letter to visit his son."

11.  I find no merit in the grounds as the  judge  properly  considered  the
    evidence and reached a finding that was open to her.

12.  Alternatively the grounds argued that the judge  in  finding  that  the
    respondent is a genuine visitor who intends to return at the end of his
    visit, has failed to provide adequate  reasons  to  address  the  ECO's
    concerns that the respondent will also, like his wife, seek  asylum  on
    arrival in the UK and that  this  is  his  true  intention  behind  the
    proposed visit.

13.  Again, I find that the judge gave proper consideration to the  evidence
    before her.  She had no evidence of the reasons for refusing  to  grant
    him a visit visa on the two previous occasions.  On the evidence before
    her she drew an inference that was reasonably open to her.

14.  I find that the grounds disclose  no  arguable  error  of  law  in  the
    judge's decision.


15.  The judge's decision allowing  the  respondent's  appeal  shall  stand.
