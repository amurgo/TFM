                                                                 Respondents

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Miss A Benfield of Counsel

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. In this appeal the Appellant is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department and Mrs Hemalatha Dhanjayaraj and Sathish Kumar Lakshmipathy
    are the Respondents.  However for the purposes of this determination  I
    shall refer to the Secretary of State as "the Respondent"  and  to  Mrs
    Hemalatha  Dhanjayaraj  and  Sathish   Kumar   Lakshmipathy   as   "the
    Appellants", which is how they were  addressed  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 2. The Appellants are citizens of India.  The first Appellant was born  on
    9th December 1987 and the second Appellant  on  5th  March  1984.   The
    second Appellant is the husband of the first Appellant and  his  appeal
    is dependent upon that of his wife, as she is the  principal  Appellant
    in these proceedings.

 3. On 27th December 2012 the principal Appellant applied for further leave
    to remain in the UK  as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant.   The
    Respondent refused the application on 2nd July 2013 on two bases.

       . The CAS assigned by the principal Appellant's Tier  4  Sponsor  did
         not  evidence  that  her  course  of  study  represented   academic
         progression.  Therefore she was  not  entitled  to  be  awarded  30
         points under Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.

       . The Appellant had not evidenced sufficient maintenance amounting to
         ï¿½2,500 and therefore she was not entitled to be awarded  10  points
         under Appendix C.

 4. The principal Appellant appealed that  refusal,  and  the  appeal  came
    before the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Meah) at Taylor House.

 5. After hearing submissions  from  the  Appellant's  representative  (the
    Respondent being unrepresented at the hearing), the judge decided  that
    the Respondent's decision was not in accordance with  the  law  as  the
    Respondent had failed to apply her own policy, namely  her  guidance  -
    Tier 4 - v.6.0 in relation  to  evidential  flexibility  regarding  the
    principal  Appellant's  CAS  and  the  lack  of  relevant   information
    regarding academic progression.

 6. The judge noted that this guidance  was  extant  at  the  date  of  the
    principal Appellant's  application  and  noted  that  the  Respondent's
    policy at that time was to make an enquiry in the event that a CAS  had
    been issued without evidence of academic progression.

 7. Having accepted this argument and considered that this  amounted  to  a
    fatal error in the Respondent's decision, the judge made the  following
    decision.

         "Decision

         The appeals are allowed to the extent that they are  remitted  back
         to the Respondent to consider afresh  given  my  finding  that  the
         original decision in the first Appellant's application was  not  in
         accordance with the law."

 8. The Respondent  sought  and  was  granted  permission  to  appeal  that
    decision. The grounds claimed that the judge had erred in this respect.
     Although the judge had found that the Respondent's decision was not in
    accordance with the law, since she had failed to have regard to her own
    policy in relation  to  the  principal  Appellant's  CAS,  the  judge's
    determination  was  incomplete  as  there  were  two   parts   to   the
    Respondent's decision.  The judge failed  to  go  on  to  consider  the
    remaining part of the refusal decision; namely  whether  the  principal
    Appellant could satisfy the maintenance requirements.   Had  the  judge
    made findings of fact in relation to both parts of the issue raised  in
    the refusal decision, then the judge would have been in a  position  to
    conclude that the Appellant could not satisfy the requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules in any event and should  have  gone  on  dismiss  the
    appeal. Therefore there would be no need to remit the decision  to  the
    Secretary of State as not being in accordance with the law.

 9. Permission having been granted the matter came before me.

Error of Law

10. I heard from Mr Deller and am grateful to him for his sensible approach
    to this  matter.   He  accepted  that  the  judge's  finding  that  the
    Respondent had failed to follow her own  policy  was  impugnable.   The
    question before me therefore amounted to this.  Was the judge wrong  to
    not deal with the maintenance  issue?   In  the  circumstances  of  the
    present appeal, he accepted this  would  amount  to  no  more  than  an
    academic exercise.  Whatever the issue with the  maintenance  question,
    he could not resile from the fact that the policy in force at the  time
    that this decision was made, had not been properly followed.  The judge
    took the view that what was before him was one decision and that  since
    that decision was not in accordance with the law, there was no need  to
    go further than that and make findings on the maintenance issue.   That
    was a valid view point and the sensible course would be for  the  whole
    decision to be looked at again in the  light  of  whether  or  not  the
    principal Appellant had made academic progression. If that  turned  out
    to be the case as expected then it was probable  that  the  maintenance
    issue could be looked at again as part of that decision and resolved.

11. Miss Benfield unsurprisingly had nothing further to add to this.

12.  I find therefore that the  decision  of  the  Respondent  was  not  in
    accordance with the law  and  that  the  decision  remains  outstanding
    before the Respondent there being no requirement for the judge to  make
    any finding on the maintenance component contained in the decision.

Decision

13.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal, finding that the Secretary of
    State's decision of 2nd July 2013 refusing  the  principal  Appellant's
    application was not in accordance with the law, stands.   The  decision
    concerning the second Appellant  stands  with  that  of  the  principal
    Appellant. The Secretary of States appeal before me is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made
