Representation:
For the Appellant: Mr R Sharma (Counsel)
For the Respondent: Ms J Isherwood (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   I shall refer to the parties as "the appellant" and  "the  Respondent".
    This is an error of law hearing to consider whether or not there was  a
    material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge
    Chana) ("FTT") promulgated on 19th December 2016 in which she dismissed
    the appellant's appeal against an application for leave to remain under
    Tier 4, having refused an application for  an  adjournment  on  medical
    grounds.  The hearing took place  on  17th  August  2016  and  the  FTT
    determined the appeal on the papers.

Background

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan and his date of  birth  is  [  ]
    1987.  He entered the UK as a student and studied in  accountancy  from
    2009.  He was then granted leave with a post study visa between 2012  -
    2014.  He applied for further leave to study on a course in health care
    management.  The respondent refused the application  on  28.11.2014  on
    the grounds that the appellant was not a genuine student and could  not
    support himself without working in breach of his visa  conditions  with
    reference to paragraph 245ZX(o) Immigration Rules.

FTT decision

3.    The  appeal  came  before  the  FTT  for  hearing.  Counsel  made   an
    application for an adjournment on the grounds that  the  appellant  was
    ill suffering from mental  health  difficulties.  The  application  was
    refused by the FTT and Counsel withdrew as he had instructions only  to
    make the application [14-17].   The  FTT  proceeded  to  determine  the
    appeal [18-25] on the papers which included an  interview  record  with
    the appellant, the appellant's witness  statement  and  some  financial
    evidence.  The FTT found the appellant's claim to be a genuine  student
    to be lacking in credibility in the light of his decision to change his
    career path from accountancy to healthcare. The appellant's claim  that
    he studied healthcare in 2001 was not  found  credible  given  that  he
    would have been aged 14 years at that time  [20].  The  FTT  found  the
    documentary evidence to be unreliable  and  did  not  accept  that  the
    appellant lived on ï¿½47.00 pw [24].   Article 8 was not engaged  as  the
    FTT found that the appellant must have been aware that his stay in  the
    UK was temporary [26-27]

Application for permission to appeal

4.   In unnecessarily long grounds it  was  contended  that  the  FTT  erred
    procedurally by unfairly refusing to grant  an  adjournment  which  had
    resulted in the appellant being deprived of the opportunity  to  attend
    for the hearing and to give oral evidence.   The  history  of  previous
    adjournments was not  relevant.  The  appellant  had  produced  medical
    evidence in support of his mental ill health.  The FTT failed  to  give
    adequate consideration to the evidence  and  failed  to  give  adequate
    reasons for refusing the adjournment.  It was  further  contended  that
    the FTT failed to consider all of the evidence as  to  the  substantive
    issues.

Permission grant

5.   Permission was granted by UTJ Grubb  on 7th August 2017 who found  that
    there were arguable grounds in the light of the medical  evidence  that
    the FTT erred by refusing to grant the adjournment.



Rule 24 Response

6.   The respondent opposed the application  arguing  that  the  appeal  was
    outstanding since 29.6.2015 when first listed for hearing.   There  was
    no evidence to show when the appellant would be well  to  attend.   The
    FTT was entitled to proceed given that two years had  elapsed  and  the
    appeal remained unresolved.  The decision was  reasoned  and  was  fair
    given the length of delay.

Submisssions

7.   At the outset the representatives indicated that they had  been  unable
    to agree the background chronology in particular  with  regard  to  the
    medical evidence that had been before the FTT.

8.   I proposed the following  chronology  with  documentary  references  to
    Appellant's bundle;

         - hearing listed  for  29.6.2015  adjourned  on  basis  of  written
         request

         -  relisted  for  hearing  7.3.2016.  Written  request   (J3)   for
         adjournment refused on 3.3.2016  (J2)  as  sick  certificate  (back
         pain) (J4) was inadequate evidence.   Application  renewed  at  the
         hearing and granted.

         -  relisted  for  hearing  on  15.7.2016.   Written   request   for
         adjournment dated 8.7.16 refused (I1).   Renewed  oral  application
         granted on basis of letter from GP dated  4.7.2016  (I2)  and  from
         social worker dated 14.7.2016 (H4).

         - hearing relisted for 17.8.2016.  Written request for  adjournment
         made by solicitors referring to H4 dated 14.7.2016 was  refused  on
         9.8.2016 as no medical evidence provided and no date  for  recovery
         given.  Letter dated  15.8.2016  from  GP  (H1)  stating  that  the
         appellant remains ill and suggests  further  6  months  before  new
         hearing date. Renewed at hearing and refused.

9.   The chronology was agreed and I queried whether or not  the  GP  letter
    H1 was before the FTT.

10.  Mr Sharma submitted that the letter dated  15.8.2016  (H1)  was  before
    the FTT and that the FTT failed to place sufficient weight on the  same
    and placed too much weight on the  history  of  previous  adjournments.
    The decision and reasons was unclear as to what  medical  evidence  was
    before the FTT at the hearing [14].  The  FTT  misquoted  a  letter  as
    being from a GP when in fact it was from a social worker, and there was
    a 6 month delay by the FTT before the decision  was  promulgated.   The
    content of the letter 15.8.2016 (H1) was referred to in  the  decision.
    The FTT erred in stating that there was  no  medical  evidence  and  no
    indication given as to when the appellant would be able to attend [16].
    The appellant had mental health difficulties and this had  impacted  on
    his ability to give instructions.  The FTT could have taken alternative
    steps such as listing a CMR.  Mr Sharma confirmed  that  the  appellant
    had now seen his solicitors and given instructions  and  was  ready  to
    proceed.

11.  Ms Isherwood submitted that the real issue was when the matter  was  to
    be determined finally. The FTT was correct in taking  the  decision  to
    refuse the adjournment.  It was unclear as to the nature and extent  of
    the appellant's illness and there must be concerns as to his intentions
    as found by the FTT [22].  The application was refused in 2014  and  it
    must be accepted that the appellant was in a position  to  prepare  his
    case.

Discussion and conclusion

12.  Having considered all of the evidence and in the light of the  lack  of
    precision  in  the  decision  and  reasons  as  to  the  dates  on  the
    documentary evidence [14] I am prepared to accept that the letter  (H1)
    was before the FTT on 17th  August  2016.   That  letter  (H1)  clearly
    stated that the appellant  suffered  from  mental  health  difficulties
    (psychosis with depression and possible schizophrenia) and that he  was
    mentally unstable and reclusive in  his  home.   There  was  additional
    evidence from the appellant's social worker and his solicitors produced
    in respect of previous applications.  There were no concerns raised  or
    investigation as to the authenticity of the medical evidence.  Somewhat
    oddly the solicitor's letter H3  requesting  the  adjournment  for  the
    hearing of 17th August 2016 is dated 5.8.2015, but this is likely to be
    a typo. In the circumstances I am satisfied that the FTT erred  by  way
    of procedural unfairness in refusing the adjournment and thus depriving
    the appellant of the opportunity to attend for the hearing  when  there
    was medical evidence that he suffered from mental  illness  and  was  a
    recluse.  I accept that there was a very lengthy and open ended  delay,
    but there were alternative steps that could have been taken by the FTT,
    and which now perhaps should be taken. The FTT could  have  listed  the
    matter for a CMR hearing  and  made  a  direction  for  expert  medical
    evidence to be produced.   In the circumstances I find that  there  has
    been unfairness to the appellant. There is no alternative but to relist
    the matter for an expedited hearing de novo at Hatton Cross  (excluding
    Judge Chana).  Ground one only is made out.  The remaining grounds were
    not pursued and in any event permission was not granted in  respect  of
    the same.   The  appellant  has  provided  a  witness  statement  dated
    22.9.2017 and no reference is made to any current  health  difficulties
    that would prevent him from attending for the hearing.

Decision

There is a material error of law in the decision which shall be set aside.

Expedited Hearing de novo at Hatton Cross (excluding Judge Chana).
