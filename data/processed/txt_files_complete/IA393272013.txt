Representation:

For the claimants:     MS G Brown, instructed by Danielle Cohen Solicitors
For the appellant:     Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimants, Kemi Okebile, date of birth 21.9.71, and  Tinufe  Zainab
    Okegbile, date of birth 16.6.96, are citizens of Nigeria.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lingham promulgated 2.9.14,  allowing  the
    claimants' appeals against the decisions of  the  Secretary  of  State,
    dated 16.9.13, to refuse their applications for leave to remain in  the
    UK, and to remove them from the UK as illegal entrants under section 10
    of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  The Judge heard the appeal  on
    4.6.14, but the decision was not drafted until 15.8.14.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Lever  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    20.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 11.12.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Lingham should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can  be  briefly  summarised  as  follows.  The
    claimants made application on 22.12.12 for leave to remain outside  the
    Rules, on the basis of human rights. The application was refused,  with
    no right of appeal. Following an application for judicial  review,  the
    Secretary of State reconsidered the  application,  but  refused  it  on
    13.9.13, with a right of appeal. It follows that  the  application  the
    subject of the appeal was made in 2011, prior to the coming into  force
    of the new Rules on 9.7.12.

 7. Judge Lingham relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in Edgehill
    v SSHD [2014]  EWCA  Civ  402,  for  authority  to  consider  that  the
    applications should have been considered under the old Rules.

 8. Rarely oddly, the judge made an article 8 assessment outside the  Rules
    first, before going on to consider the Immigration Rules.  The  correct
    approach is to consider the immigration rules first, before  going  on,
    if necessary to consider article 8 ECHR outside the Rules. At  �70  the
    judge found that the decisions of the Secretary to remove the claimants
    was disproportionate and thus the claimants succeeded under  article  8
    ECHR. The judge then went on to find in the alternative that whilst the
    second claimant succeeded under the Rules, the first claimant did  not.
    The body of the discussion of these issues,  particularly  between  �75
    and �76 is rather confused as to which claimant is being referred to.

 9. In essence, the ground assert that the judge erred in law by failing to
    identify which old Rules were relevant;  erred  in  the  reasonableness
    assessment; and failed to take account of section 117B of the 2002  Act
    as amended.

10. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Lever found that it was unclear
    from the decision of the First-tier Tribunal which old  rules  applied.
    "That is consistent with the judge having dismissed the first appellant
    (mother) case under the rules. However inconsistent with that  approach
    the judge appears to have considered the  second  appellant  (dependant
    child) appeal under the new rules and found she succeeded  under  those
    rules. It is arguable therefore that there  was  an  error  of  law  in
    making an inconsistent  approach  to  the  appellants  and  incorrectly
    considering the new rules in respect of the second appellant."

11. "Further it is arguable that the judge at no stage makes reference  to,
    or appears to consider the  statutory  changes  brought  about  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014. This is perhaps pertinent as the  judge  arguably
    makes little or no reference to the public interest factors  even  when
    conducting a balancing exercise under Razgar in the determination."

12. At �27 of the decision, the judge relied on Edgehill to find  that  the
    Secretary of State had incorrectly "applied her mind to the  new  rules
    instead  of  the  rules  that  were  in  existence  at  the   date   of
    application." The grounds rightly criticise this  finding,  which  does
    not there, or anywhere else in the decision, explain what  'old  rules'
    should have been applied, or purport to apply any such  old  rules.  If
    the judge considered that the Secretary of State's decision was not  in
    accordance with the correct law, the  judge  should  have  allowed  the
    appeals to that limited extent, to the effect that it remained for  the
    Secretary of State to make decisions which were in accordance with  the
    law.

13. The transitional provisions accompanying the new Rules  in  force  from
    9.7.12 preserved the effect of the previous version of  the  Rules  for
    applications made under the Rules prior to 9.7.12 but  not  decided  by
    that date. However, this was a human rights article 8 ECHR application,
    made entirely outside the Rules on form  FLR(O).  There  were  no  pre-
    9.7.12 Rules for dealing with article 8.  The  transitional  provisions
    have  no  relevance  to  an  application  made  entirely  outside   the
    Immigration Rules, as there was no equivalent provision under  the  old
    Rules for consideration of the  application.  The  only  framework  for
    considering private and  family  life  in  existence  at  the  date  of
    decision was that of the new Rules under paragraph 276ADE and  Appendix
    FM. The Secretary of State is required to undertake  a  proportionality
    assessment and the new Rules comprise the current  framework  for  that
    assessment. This is entirely  consistent  with  both  Haleemudeen,  and
    Edgehill.

14. In R(on the  application  of  Rafiq)  [2014]  EWHC  1654  the  claimant
    Pakistani national met and married a British citizen after his  student
    visa had expired. His application for leave to remain in the  UK  as  a
    spouse was refused after amendments were made to the Immigration  Rules
    in July 2012.  The Administrative  Court  distinguished  Edgehill.  The
    Court found that both before and after the changes  to  the  Rules  the
    overriding test was that of Article 8 of the ECHR and it was reasonable
    for decision-makers to approach the Article 8 claim using the tests  in
    the  new  Rules,  bearing  in  mind  the  provisions  for   exceptional
    circumstances. The Secretary of State's conclusion  that  hardship  did
    not amount to an insurmountable obstacle  was  rational  and  had  been
    sufficiently explained in the decision letters. However, in R  (on  the
    application of Iqbal) v SSHD [2014] EWHC 1822 (Admin) it was held  that
    the SSHD had wrongly applied Paragraph 276ADE and Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules to her initial decision on the Claimant's  case,  but
    that defect  was  cured  by  a  supplementary  decision  which,  albeit
    applying those provisions, did so in a manner which was appropriate  to
    applications both pre and post 9  July  2012  in  substance  and  which
    ensured that all conceivable Article 8 considerations, including  those
    not expressly provided for in the provisions of the new Rules, had been
    assessed.

15. In Haleemudeen v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 558 the Court of Appeal  was  not
    concerned by the fact that paragraph 276ADE had  been  considered  even
    though the application  preceded  the  new  rules.  It  was  said  that
    paragraph 276ADE could not be disregarded even once it was  clear  that
    the case did not fall within the Immigration Rules, because although it
    was not dispositive,  it  provided  guidance  about  the  Secretary  of
    State's policy in the same way as paragraph 276ADE and Appendix FM.

16. In the circumstances, I find that decision of the  Secretary  of  State
    was in accordance with the law and that she  was  correct  to  consider
    Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE, before going on to  consider  whether
    there were exceptional circumstances in which refusal would  result  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences such that it would be disproportionate
    to the claimants' private and family life rights under article 8 ECHR.

17. However, nothing of any significance follows from  the  application  of
    the new Rules in the decision of the Secretary of State on the facts of
    the present case. That is because neither the Secretary  of  State  nor
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge stopped short at the Rules.  The  refusal
    decision  went  on  to   consider   whether   there   were   compelling
    circumstances, which, exceptionally, would justify allowing the appeals
    on the basis of article 8 ECHR. On  the  facts  of  this  case,  it  is
    inevitable that  an  article  8  assessment  would  have  to  be  made,
    especially since Ganesabalan v SSHD [2014] EWHC 2712 Admin) has made it
    clear that there can be no threshold requirement  to  consideration  of
    article 8 ECHR, unless the Rules are a complete code,  which  they  are
    not for consideration of article 8 ECHR cases other  than  deportation.
    Further, it is likely that article  8  has  to  be  considered  because
    section 86 of the 2002 Act requires determination of  a  claim  on  the
    basis of human rights.

18. I also find that the assessment of reasonableness in  relation  to  the
    second claimant is fundamentally  flawed.  The  fact  that  the  second
    claimant has lived in the UK for  over  7  years  does  not  by  itself
    establish that it would be unreasonable to remove her. The judge  seems
    to have assumed that she had a right to continue education in  the  UK,
    when she and her mother are Nigeria citizens illegally present  in  the
    UK. The judge failed to consider  a  strong  line  of  case  authority,
    including Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] UKSC 74, and EV (Philippines) &  Ors  v
    SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874, to the effect that it is entirely  reasonable
    and not irrational to expect a child to leave the UK to return to their
    home country with their parent, with whom they have the basis of  their
    family life. Although all things being equal it would be  in  the  best
    interests of a child to remain in the UK, matters are  not  equal.  The
    second claimant is not a British citizen and the UK cannot educate  the
    world. I further find that the assessment  in  respect  of  the  second
    claimant was made in absence of consideration of the  position  of  the
    first claimant mother, who had no basis to remain  in  the  UK  and  if
    there are best interests to be considered then  the  second  claimant's
    best interests must be to remain with her mother and to  leave  the  UK
    with her mother. Further, it shouldb  e  noted  that  by  the  date  of
    promulgation of this decision, the second claimant had  turned  18  and
    was thus an adult.

19. I note that section 177B came into force after the  hearing  date,  but
    before drafting of the decision and thus promulgation. It  is  a  clear
    error of law that the First-tier Tribunal failed  to  properly  address
    the  public  interest  in  conducting  the  article  8  proportionality
    assessment. Not only was section 117B  not  applied,  in  which  little
    weight should  have  been  accorded  to  the  private  life  of  either
    claimant, it is evident from the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    that inadequate consideration has been given to the public interest  in
    removal of the claimants.

20. In the circumstances, the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  cannot
    stand and must be set aside and remade.

21. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal vitiates all  other  findings  of
    fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been  a
    valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

22. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the Secretary of State of a fair  hearing
    and that the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
    necessary for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is  such  that,
    having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with  cases
    fairly and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I  find  that
    it is appropriate to remit this appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusion & Decision:

23. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside and remade.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  de
                    novo hearing.

Directions

24. The appeal has been listed for rehearing before the First-tier Tribunal
    at Taylor House on 15.5.15.

25. No findings of fact are preserved. The  appeal  is  to  be  a  de  novo
    hearing.

26. The estimated length of hearing is 3 hours. No interpreter is required.




Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has  been  remitted  for  rehearing  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal and thus the outcome of the appeal remains unclear at this stage.
