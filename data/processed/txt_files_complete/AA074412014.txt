                            DECISION AND REASONS


1     This is an appeal against the decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Robertson dated 1 May 2015, in which the Judge dismissed  the
      Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision of  10  September
      2014 to refuse to vary his leave to remain, and to make a decision  to
      remove  the  Appellant  under  section  47  Immigration,  Asylum   and
      Nationality Act 2006. The nature of the Appellant's challenge to  that
      decision is such that it is  necessary  to  consider  the  Appellant's
      earlier immigration history in some detail.
2     The Appellant was born on 6 September 1995  in  Afghanistan.  He  left
      Afghanistan in around March 2009, and arrived in  the  UK  on  the  29
      September 2009, and claimed asylum on 4 November 2009, on which date a
      screening interview took place. He was then 14 years  old.  A  witness
      statement and SEF form were completed for the Appellant on 1  December
      2009, and he had a child SEF interview on 2 March 2010.

3      The  Respondent  refused  asylum  18  March  2010,  but  granted  the
      Appellant discretionary leave to remain to 6 March 2013, by which time
      the  Appellant  would  have  been  17  ï¿½,  in  accordance   with   the
      Respondent's relevant policy regarding  unaccompanied  asylum  seeking
      children.

4     The Appellant claims to be from the Wardak  province  of  Afghanistan,
      and that the Taliban stored weapons in the basement of the Appellant's
      home. They would generally come at night to collect them,  and  return
      them in the morning. On one occasion when the Appellant was about  13,
      the Taliban were taking tea at the Appellant's  house.  The  Appellant
      had refused to fetch a spitting dish for them,  and  one  Taliban  had
      stabbed him in the right thigh, requiring  medical  treatment.  On  an
      occasion in the early part of 2009, Afghan authorities attended at the
      home, confiscated the weapons, and beat and arrested his  father.  The
      Taliban attended at the family home later that night, and upon finding
      that the weapons had been confiscated by the state  authorities,  said
      that it must have been either the Appellant's father or the  Appellant
      who had informed the authorities, and they threatened  to  come  back.
      The  Appellant,  his  mother  and  younger  sister  travelled  to  the
      Appellant's maternal uncle's house in Kabul (which the  Appellant  had
      visited several times before).

5     The Appellant therefore claimed to fear harm from the Taliban, on  the
      grounds that they perceived the Appellant to have  informed  on  them,
      and from the Afghan authorities, on the  basis  that  the  family  had
      assisted the Taliban.

6     The Appellant appealed against the refusal of asylum to the FtT,  that
      appeal being heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Andrew.  In  a
      determination dated 29th  of  April  2010,  the  Judge  dismissed  the
      appeal. The Judge did not find the Appellant's account  credible,  for
      reasons including those discussed at paragraph 20(h),  (i),  (m),  and
      (n) of her decisions, as discussed at para 30 of the  present  Judge's
      decision.  Those reasons were, in summary:

      (h)   if the Taliban were in the Appellant's village 'day and  night',
           there was no credible reason why they would return their weapons
           to the Appellant's parents' home during the day;
      (i)   it was more likely that the Taliban  would  need  their  weapons
           during the day than the night;

      (m)   the Appellant had given inconsistent evidence as to the presence
           of Taliban and Afghan government authorities in the village;

      (n)   the Appellant's evidence that the Afghan authorities went to his
           maternal uncle's house in  Kabul  looking  for  the  Appellant's
           mother (or alternatively, looking for  the  Appellant's  mother,
           and the Appellant, and his sister), was not credible; the Afghan
           authorities  would  have  no  reason  to  contact  them,  having
           confiscated the weapons and detained his father;  this  part  of
           his account had been invented.

7     Judge Andrew also found at paragraph 22 of her decision: "I  found  on
      the evidence before me that the  Appellant's  mother  and  sister  and
      uncle are currently residing in Afghanistan, in  Kabul.  I  find  that
      there is no evidence that the  Appellant  would  be  targeted  by  the
      Taliban or the authorities in Afghanistan."

8     No further appeal was brought against that decision.

9     On 4 March 2013, the Appellant made an application for  further  leave
      to remain in the UK. The evidence  relied  upon  in  support  of  that
      application is set out at paragraph 67 of the subsequent  decision  of
      the Respondent refusing further leave, dated  10  September  2014.  It
      included a number of letters from the British Red  Cross  relating  to
      the Appellant's attempts to trace his  family,  and  evidence  of  the
      Appellant's private life in the UK.

10    The Respondent refused to vary the Appellant's leave in  its  decision
      of 10 September 2014.

11    The Appellant pursued his  appeal  to  the  first-tier  Tribunal,  his
      hearing coming before Judge Robertson at Sheldon  Court  on  21  April
      2014. I note here the case as advanced by the Appellant at First tier.
      A skeleton argument relied upon by Miss Hobbs of Council appearing for
      the Appellant set out at paragraphs 1-8 the nature of the  Appellant's
      original claim for protection, and  the  history  of  the  appeal.  At
      paragraph 9 it was argued that internal relocation to Kabul  would  be
      unduly harsh on the basis  of  various  security  incidents  occurring
      there; because the Appellant had  never  lived  there,  had  no  links
      there, and had no relatives to return  to.  At  paragraph  10  it  was
      argued that the Appellant was not able to seek the protection  of  the
      state in Afghanistan due  to  the  history  of  tribal  and  political
      instability as well as the frail security situation that exists there.
      Articles 2 and 3 ECHR were relied upon for the above  reasons  and  at
      paragraph 12  onwards,  submissions  were  made  in  relation  to  the
      Appellant's private life in the United Kingdom.  At  paragraph  18  an
      argument was advanced that under Article 15 (c) of  the  Qualification
      Directive the Appellant would face a real  risk  of  serious  harm  if
      returned to Afghanistan as  he  would  not  be  seen  as  an  ordinary
      citizen, but one who is likely to have certain attributes and benefits
      of having lived in Europe, placing him at serious risk of harm.

12    In her decision of 1 May 2015 the  Judge  correctly  directed  herself
      that the earlier determination would represent the starting  point  in
      the assessment of  the  Appellant's  claim  (Devaseelan  [2002]  UKIAT
      00702).  The Judge noted at [29] the existence of  a  scarring  report
      from a Dr Chandler in relation to the Appellant which post-dated Judge
      Andrew's decision, and which stated that a  scar  to  the  Appellant's
      right thigh was  highly  consistent  with  a  stab  wound.  The  Judge
      directed herself that his task was to "reassess credibility on all the
      evidence in the round in light of this report and not simply  to  rely
      on the report as confirming that the  Appellant's  account  was  true"
      (paragraph 29). She noted that the report related to a  single  injury
      only, not a number of injuries, and that 'highly consist' category was
      defined as "... the lesion  could  have  been  caused  by  the  trauma
      described, and there are few other possible causes."

13    At [30] the Judge gave  her  assessment  of  the  credibility  of  the
      Appellant's account. At [30I]  the  Judge  noted  differences  in  the
      Appellant's account of the stabbing incident, as given  in  his  first
      witness statement, second witness statement, and his account given the
      Dr Chandler; and held that in any event it was not plausible that  the
      Appellant would openly defy a group of Taliban men when he  was  aware
      that they were dangerous.

14    At [30II] the Judge referred to the findings at paras  20(h)  and  (i)
      of Judge Andrew's decision  regarding  the  plausibility  of  why  the
      Taliban would need to leave their weapons  at  the  Appellant's  house
      during the day; acknowledged that there was some evidence  to  suggest
      that Taliban fought at night, but  held  that  the  evidence  did  not
      negate the finding of Judge Andrew that there was also  likely  to  be
      fighting during the day.

15    At [30VI] the Judge referred to Judge Andrew's  finding  at  her  para
      20(n) regarding discrepancies and implausibilities in the  Appellant's
      account of the Afghan authorities visiting the material uncle's  house
      in Kabul; noted that in evidence before her, the Appellant shifted his
      evidence during the hearing about that  this  matter,  and  held  that
      there was nothing before her that would lead her to  differ  from  the
      conclusion reached by Judge Andrew in relation to this inconsistency.

16    At [30VIII] the Judge referred to Judge Andrew's finding at  her  para
      20(m) that the Appellant had given inconsistent  evidence  as  to  the
      presence of Taliban and Afghan government authorities in the  village,
      and noted at her [30VIII] that nowhere within the Appellant's evidence
      before her had that inconsistency been addressed.

17    At [30X] the Judge noted discrepancies in the Appellant's evidence  as
      to the time of day the Taliban would arrive  at,  and  held  that  the
      Appellant's recent suggestion  that  this  may  have  been  caused  by
      interpreting difficulties  was  an  attempt  to  provide  a  plausible
      explanation for the discrepancy.

18    At [31] the Judge held:

           "On the evidence in the round, I find that the medical report is
           not sufficient in itself to significantly alter  the  conclusion
           that the Appellant's account lacks credibility. I find,  to  the
           lower standard of proof that the Appellant has  not  established
           that his account of the events that led up to his departure from
           Afghanistan in fact occurred and he is therefore not entitled to
           a grant of asylum status."

19    At [32]-[38] the Judge considered submissions that the Respondent  had
      failed to discharge her duty to the Appellant under  regulation  6  of
      the Asylum Seekers (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2005 to  attempt
      to trace his family. The Judge held at [36] that the original  refusal
      letter ('RL1') dated 18 March 2010, by merely advising  the  Appellant
      that  he  could  contact  the  Red  Cross,  failed  to  discharge  the
      Respondent's duty to trace.

20    However, at [38] the Judge referred to the Respondent's statements  at
      paragraph 45 and 46 of the refusal  letter  dated  10  September  2014
      which are rather more detailed. It is there  stated  that:  "The  Home
      Office has been in contact with the British Embassy in Kabul  ...  but
      has  been  advised  ...  that  they  do  not  have  the  resources  or
      geographical capability to carry out family tracing in  the  field..."
      Other logistical obstacles are  there  set  out  as  to  any  proposed
      tracing efforts.  The Judge held at [38] that :

           " 38 ...As to the evidence  before  me,  there  was  nothing  to
           suggest that the address  given  by  the  Appellant  during  his
           asylum  interview  would  result   in   the   Respondent   being
           successfully able to trace the Appellant's family in the absence
           of an on the ground tracing service which would involve a  visit
           to the Appellant's  village. Whilst it is unclear  what  further
           information the appellant could have provided to the  respondent
           (other than an email address or a telephone number), it is  also
           unclear from Miss Hobbs' submissions whether she was  suggesting
           that the address given by the appellant should have resulted  in
           on the ground enquiries by the Respondent. I cannot go so far as
           to hold that the Respondent should have agents on the ground  to
           attempt to trace the family members of  each  Afghan  minor  who
           enters the UK  to  claim  asylum.   Whilst  I  accept  that  the
           Appellant had provided details of his home address at his asylum
           interview, given the lack  of  credibility  of  the  Appellant's
           account, I find that a causal  link  has  not  been  established
           between the Respondent's failure to trace as set out in RL1  and
           the failure by the Appellant to substantiate his  asylum  claim.
           The initial failure to trace in RL1 did not impact adversely  on
           the Appellant in terms of s. 55, as the  Appellant  was  granted
           discretionary leave, and the failure to trace was in  any  event
           remedied as soon as the duty was clarified under DS.


           39. On the evidence in the round, I find that the Appellant  has
           also  not  reliably  established  that  his  family  is  not  in
           Afghanistan, and particularly that his maternal uncle W, is  not
           still in Kabul where he was when he made  arrangements  for  the
           appellant to travel to the UK. ..."


21    At [41] the Judge noted that no oral argument  had  been  made  before
      her in relation to Article 15(c) of the Qualification  Directive,  but
      considered relevant Country Guidance authority on the point, and  held
      that the Appellant had not made out a case under Art 15(c).

22    At [42], the Judge found inadequate  evidence  to  support  any  claim
      that the Appellant would be at risk of harm due to  his  pursuance  of
      martial arts/as an athlete.

23     At  [43]-[54]  the  Judge  found  that  whilst  the   Appellant   had
      established a private life in  the  UK,  the  interference  with  that
      private life by the proposed removal would not be disproportionate.

24    The Appellant's grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal were  prepared
      by Ms Blair of Council, who did  not  appear  before  the  First  tier
      judge. The Appellant's 12 page grounds of appeal dated 14 May 2015 and
      the renewed grounds dated 11 June 2015 (following initial  refusal  of
      permission on 28 May  2015)  are  the  same  in  content,  but  rather
      unhelpfully, the grounds have been renumbered and reordered,  and  the
      paragraph numbering changed. I observed to Ms  Blair  at  the  hearing
      that this did not facilitate the Tribunal's  better  understanding  of
      the Appellant's case. In any event the  ordering  of  the  grounds  of
      appeal seems to me to make more logical sense in the original  grounds
      of appeal dated 14 May 2015.

25    It is to be noted also that whilst  preparing  for  this  hearing  the
      Tribunal had cause  to  contact  Ms  Blair's  instructing  solicitors,
      because within the Tribunal file, the copy of the renewed  grounds  of
      appeal dated 11 of June 2015 appeared  to  contain  only  every  other
      page.  This does not appear to be  a  copying  error  by  Field  House
      internal administration; one can see from the fax data of the  top  of
      the renewed grounds of appeal at the time  that  the  application  was
      filed with the Tribunal that only every other page of the grounds  was
      sent. Without delving into the matter any further, it therefore  seems
      curious that Upper Tribunal Judge Eshun did  not  raise  this  problem
      when she was considering the renewed application, on which she granted
      permission on 27 July 2015. It is to be assumed that she had regard to
      the earlier grounds of 14 May 2015. Permission was granted  generally.



26    A full copy of the renewed grounds of appeal were provided  to  me  by
      the Appellant's instructing solicitors the  day  before  the  hearing.
      Together with that document I was provided with  a  skeleton  argument
      prepared by Ms Blair dated 14 December 2015, some 8 pages  long,  and,
      extraordinarily, a document entitled "Appendix 1 to skeleton  argument
      for the Appellant",  another 8 pages long.

27    What  can  be  said  about  all  these  documents  is  that  they  are
      extraordinarily prolix and have done little to assist the Tribunal  in
      a clear understanding of the Appellant's  case.   It  is  also  to  be
      observed that in some respects they seek to raise legal  issues  which
      were not raised before the First tier Tribunal.

28    At the hearing, I heard oral  submissions  from  both  parties.  Given
      that the content of the renewed grounds  does  not  materially  differ
      from the initial grounds, and, in my view,  the  earlier  grounds  are
      better  ordered,  I  shall  address  those  grounds.  They  raise  the
      following issues.

29    Ground one: "Failure to approach asylum  claim  as  evidence  from  an
      adult remembering events that took place as a child"

30    The ground appears to argue that in applying Devaseelan, and  treating
      the first decision as the relevant  starting  point  for  the  present
      Tribunal's decision on credibility, the  Judge  failed  to  take  into
      account  changes  in  the  subjective  evidence  of  the  Appellant  (
      including the scarring report) and that the law as  to  assessment  of
      credibility of minors had moved on considerably since the time of  the
      first decision.

31    The Appellant here asserts that since the hearing of  2010,  paragraph
      351 of the immigration rules had been introduced to the  rules,  which
      refers  to  account  being  taken  of  an  applicant's  maturity  when
      assessing credibility. However, this is patently false. Paragraph  351
      of the immigration rules has been present  in  the  immigration  rules
      since HC395 was introduced on 1 October 1994. I indicated to Ms  Blair
      that I found it difficult to understand how she could have made such a
      clear assertion of law which was so manifestly incorrect.  She had  no
      explanation and did not pursue the point.

32    Paragraphs 3(b) and 3(c)  of  the  grounds  refer  to  AA  (unattended
      children) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00016  and  KS  (benefit  of  the
      doubt) [2014] UKUT 552 (IAC), however no argument is advanced  in  the
      grounds which demonstrates  that  any  proposition  of  law  contained
      within either decision is a novel proposition, or represented a change
      in the law since the first tier  decided  the  Appellant's  appeal  in
      2010. Guidance as to the liberal application of  the  benefit  of  the
      doubt  to  minors  has  been  a  feature  of  refugee  law  since  the
      publication of the UNHCR Handbook  in  1979  (see  paras  213  to  219
      thereof). In any event, I note that the head note of  KS  (not  quoted
      within the grounds) provides at paragraph 3 that:

           " Correctly viewed, therefore, TBOD (the benefit of  the  doubt)
           adds nothing of substance to the lower standard of proof,  which
           as construed by the Court of Appeal in Karanakaran  v  Secretary
           of State for the Home Department [2000] 3 All ER 449, affords  a
           "positive role for uncertainty".

33    Again, there is nothing  within  the  Appellant's  grounds  of  appeal
      which establishes that there is any material change in the law  as  to
      the approach of evidence being given by minors as  the  law  presently
      stands, compared with the law as it stood  at  2010,  or  that  either
      judge misapplied that law.

34    Paragraph 3(d) of the grounds of appeal criticises both  Judge  Andrew
      in her decision of 11 May 2010, and Judge Robertson in her decision of
      1 May 2015, for failing  to  make  specific  reference  to  the  Joint
      Presidential Guidance Note No 2 of 2010: Child,  Vulnerable  Adult  or
      Sensitive Appellant  Guidance,  arguing  that  paragraph  15  of  such
      guidance required judges to refer to it.  I  find  that  Judge  Andrew
      could not have referred to such guidance in her decision,  given  that
      the guidance was published only on 28 October 2010, and  its  contents
      refers  to  other  publications  of  May  2010,  which   defeats   the
      Appellant's associated point at paragraph 5 of the grounds of  appeal.
      Again, I find it difficult to understand how Ms Blair can make such  a
      positive assertion as  to  a  Judge's  alleged  failure  to  refer  to
      guidance, when that guidance had not been published  at  the  time  of
      that  Judge's  decision.  Any  positive  assertion  that  a  different
      approach should be taken to a witness's evidence because the  law  has
      changed since the last time that such evidence was considered, must be
       properly researched, and accurate. Neither is the case here.

35    Further, paragraph 15 of the guidance does not oblige judges  to  make
      specific reference to the guidance per se. I find that Judge Robertson
      took account of the Appellant's age at the time that he had given  his
      earlier evidence, at her para [30X], and there is no specific  finding
      in the Judge's decision that the Appellant was  vulnerable.  There  is
      further no suggestion that such guidance was brought  to  the  Judge's
      attention at the First tier hearing in April 2015, by which  time,  in
      any event, the Appellant was not a child, but rather, a 19 ï¿½ year  old
      martial arts expert.

36    There is nothing in the remainder of paragraphs 4 to 6 of  ground  one
      of the grounds of appeal which remotely starts to establish  an  error
      of law in the First tier's decision.

37    Ground 2 of the Appellant's grounds of appeal is entitled "Failure  to
      consider relevant factors - not considering the Refugee Convention  or
      Articles 2 and 3 in relation to fresh protection claim".  The  grounds
      assert that the Appellant relied upon  both  his  original  protection
      claim (based on imputed political opinion) and  his  fresh  protection
      claim (which was said  to  be  based  on  the  deteriorating  security
      situation in his home area and the persecution  he  would  face  as  a
      returnee perceived  as  westernised,  particularly  as  a  westernised
      sports person). It was argued that whilst the Judge had considered the
      Appellant's original protection  claim  in  relation  to  the  Refugee
      Convention and Articles 2 and 3ECHR, and had  considered  whether  Art
      15(c) of the Qualification Directive applied, the Judge had  erred  in
      failing to provide any reasons for failing to consider the Appellant's
      fresh claim under the Refugee Convention and Articles 2 and 3ECHR.  It
      was said that the test for Article 15(c) was different from  the  test
      for recognition as a refugee or under Articles 2 or 3 ECHR.

38    Indeed it is. As per AMM and others  (conflict;  humanitarian  crisis;
      returnees; FGM) Somalia CG [2011] UKUT 445 (IAC) headnote 4:

           "...the binding Luxembourg case law of Elgafaji [2009] EUECJ  C-
           465/07 (as well as the binding domestic authority of  QD  (Iraq)
           [2009] EWCA Civ 620) makes it plain that Article  15(c)  can  be
           satisfied without there  being  such  a  level  of  risk  as  is
           required for Article 3 in cases of generalised violence  (having
           regard to the high threshold identified in NA v  United  Kingdom
           [2008] ECHR 616). The difference appears  to  involve  the  fact
           that, as the CJEU found  at  [33]  of  Elgafaji,  Article  15(c)
           covers a "more general risk of harm" than does Article 3 of  the
           ECHR; that Article 15(c) includes types of harm  that  are  less
           severe than  those  encompassed  by  Article  3;  and  that  the
           language indicating a requirement of exceptionality  is  invoked
           for different purposes in  NA  v  United  Kingdom  and  Elgafaji
           respectively."

39    Therefore Art 15(c) encompasses  not  only  serious  harm  as  defined
      under the Refugee Convention and Article 3 ECHR, but lesser  forms  of
      harm as well. Therefore, the Judge,  having rejected at [41] and  [42]
      (without complaint from the Appellant) the Appellant's claim under Art
      15(c) of the Qualification Directive,  must  also  be  taken  to  have
      rejected  the  Appellant's  claim  for  fear  harm  because   of   his
      westernised outlook under the Refugee Convention and Articles 2 and  3
      as well. The Appellant's ground is fundamentally misconceived.

40    Ground three is entitled "Error of law  on  internal  relocation"  and
      argues that at [39], the Judge errs in  law  by  failing  properly  to
      consider the test for internal relocation,  and  failing  to  consider
      whether internal relocation from  the  Appellant's  home  province  of
      Wardak to Kabul would be unreasonable or unduly harsh.

41    It is to be recalled that at [31] the Judge held  that  the  Appellant
      had not established that his account of events  that  led  up  to  his
      departure from  Afghanistan  had  in  fact  occurred.  Further,  Judge
      Andrews had held at her para  22  that  the  Appellant's  mother   and
      sister and uncle were currently  residing in  Afghanistan,  in  Kabul,
      and  Judge  Robertson  held  at  [39]  that  the  Appellant  had   not
      established that his family was not in Afghanistan,  and  particularly
      that his maternal uncle was not still  in  Kabul  (as  to  which,  see
      further below).

42    Further, whilst the Judge acknowledges at  [39]  'background  evidence
      of increased insurgent activity in the Wardak province,' and the Judge
      then considers the potential of the Appellant to live in Kabul,  there
      is no specific finding that the Appellant would, as a result  of  such
      activity, face serious harm  under  the  Refugee  Convention  and  /or
      Articles 2 or 3 ECHR, or indeed under harm under Article 15(c) of  the
      Qualification Directive in Wardak province. Insofar as  the  Appellant
      proceeds on the basis that there is such a finding, he is wrong.

43    The grounds of appeal do not allege any error of law by  reason  of  a
      failure to make a relevant finding  of  risk  in  Wardak  province  by
      reason of insurgent  activity,  and  Ms  Blair  did  not  draw  to  my
      attention any country information which tended  to  suggest  that  the
      situation in Wardak at the time of the Judge's  decision  crossed  the
      threshold into Article 15(c) risk.

44    I therefore find that in the absence of any  reliable  account  having
      been given as to a risk of harm existing for the Appellant  in  Wardak
      province, and in the absence of any finding that  an  Art  15(c)  risk
      arose for him in that area, there was  no  reason  for  the  Judge  to
      consider potential internal flight for the Appellant, then aged 19  ï¿½,
      to Kabul in any event.

45    Ground four of the grounds is entitled "Conclusion on  ties  to  birth
      family founded on no  evidence".  The  grounds  take  issue  with  the
      Judge's conclusion at [39]. I provide the paragraph in full here:

           "On the evidence in the round, I find  that  the  Appellant  has
           also  not  reliably  established  that  his  family  is  not  in
           Afghanistan, and particularly that his maternal uncle W, is  not
           still in Kabul where he was when he made  arrangements  for  the
           Appellant to travel to the  UK.  In  the  circumstances,  whilst
           there is background evidence of increased insurgent activity  in
           the Wardak province, the point of return to the  Appellant  will
           be Kabul from whence his uncle can take  charge  of  him.  Given
           that his uncle arranged for  him  to  leave  the  UK,  there  is
           nothing before me to suggest that he  will  not  facilitate  his
           return and contact with his own family. On my  findings,  he  is
           not a child, he is not an orphan, and he will not be  unattended
           on return to Afghanistan."

46    The Appellant's ground suggests that the Judge errs in law  by  making
      a finding unsupported by any evidence, and that the Judge  has  failed
      to have adequate regard to witness evidence (including  evidence  from
      the Appellant's supporting witnesses) that the Appellant has not  been
      in touch with his family since being in the UK.

47    I do not find that the Appellant has made out a claim that  the  Judge
      has failed to take relevant evidence into account.  At [25] the  Judge
      states that for the avoidance of doubt, in reaching her decision,  she
      has considered all documentary and oral evidence before him,  even  if
      not specifically referred to in the decision, and the Judge makes  his
      finding at [39] 'on the evidence in the round'. Further, at  [34]  the
      Judge considered the Appellant's own efforts to trace his family:

           "As to the evidential weight to be given to the letters from the
           Red Cross, I note that the details given by the Appellant of his
           family in Afghanistan in his SI  (Screening  interview)  ..  are
           that his family composed S (his mother), I ( his father)  and  M
           (his sister). His maternal uncles  name  was  given  as  W.  The
           correspondence relates to tracing enquiries made in  respect  of
           IN (the father) and PS. No evidence was given as to who PS  was.
           Further more, there  was  no  evidence  before  me  as  to  what
           information was supplied to the Red  Cross  to  enable  them  to
           carry out their tracing enquiries in the absence of which it  is
           difficult  to  assess  whether  the  correct   information   was
           provided. The letters from the Red Cross in themselves  are  not
           reliable evidence that concerted efforts have been made  by  the
           Appellant to trace his family. This conclusion is underlined  by
           the disclaimer in all the letters from the Red  Cross.  I  would
           note that whilst the Appellant's foster  carer,  Ms  CW,  stated
           that she had tried to help him trace his family through the  Red
           Cross, again no detail was provided as to what steps were  taken
           or what information was provided to them."

48    It is therefore clear that the Judge felt that there were  limitations
      on the weight which could be attached to the Appellant's  evidence  as
      to his own efforts  to  trace  his  family.  The  Appellant  had  been
      disbelieved, both in 2010, and in 2015, regarding the substance of his
      claim for protection. The above passage,  referring  directly  to  the
      evidence of the Appellant's former foster carer, also  undermines  the
      Appellant's assertion that such evidence was not taken into account.

49    In the circumstances, I find that the Judge was  under  no  obligation
      in law to provide any further reasoning for  her  apparent  conclusion
      that the Appellant would be able to make contact  with  his  uncle  on
      return to Afghanistan.

50    From ground five of the original  grounds  of  appeal,  the  Appellant
      moves on to questions relevant to  Article  8  ECHR.  Ground  five  is
      entitled   "Fundamental   misapplication   of   S.117B,   Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002". The ground sets out  the  provisions
      of S.117, and argues that the judge had erred in law:

      (a)   in treating the maintenance of effective immigration control  as
           a trump factor rather than a fact to be weighed  as  part  of  a
           rounded assessment,

      (b)    in  treating  the  Appellant's  period  of  lawful   leave   as
           precarious, and thus attaching little weight to that leave, and

      (c)   in treating the public interest factors set  out  in  S.117B  as
           comprehensive, whereas, it was  submitted  the  public  interest
           factors form a non exhaustive list, and the judge had  erred  in
           law in  failing  to  consider  other  relevant  public  interest
           factors weighing in favour of the Appellant.

51    This ground contains a lengthy  quote  from  AA  (Afghanistan)  [2012]
      UKUT 00016 (IAC) relevant to the issue that minor children should  not
      be punished for the actions of adults,  for  example  in  the  instant
      case, the Appellant's family decision to send  the  Appellant  to  the
      United Kingdom to claim asylum, having no other lawful reason to enter
      the UK. However, it seems to me that the Judge gave due weight to  the
      length of time that the Appellant  has  been  present  in  the  United
      Kingdom, the ties that he has established in this country, and has not
      placed undue weight, in his assessment of the Appellant's private life
      in the United Kingdom, on the fact that the Appellant had  entered  as
      an asylum seeker, and had failed to establish any legitimate claim for
      protection  under  the  refugee  Convention.   There  is  no  material
      misdirection in law in that regard. Further, there is nothing whatever
      in the decision which indicates that the Judge treated maintenance  of
      immigration control as a 'trump card'; the Judge clearly set  out  the
      various factors which tended to militating in favour of the  Appellant
      with her decision.

52    The grounds also appear to argue that the Judge, although  recognising
      the Appellant has been engaging in social activities in the  UK,  such
      as his help coaching younger children  and  adults  in  martial  arts,
      misdirected herself in law in considering  only  the  benefit  to  the
      Appellant in such activities, rather than the wider community benefit,
      when  assessing  the  Appellant's   private   life,   and   that   the
      proportionality of the Appellant's proposed removal. However,  I  find
      that the judge adequately considers the Appellant's activities in  the
      UK, both insofar as they benefited him, and the  wider  community,  in
      paragraphs 45, 47, and 53 of the decision.


53    Ground 5(b) of the grounds of appeal argues that the  Judge  erred  in
      law  in  finding  that  little  weight  should  be  attached  to   the
      Appellant's private life developed whilst in the United  Kingdom.  The
      grounds argue at length that the limited  leave  to  remain  that  the
      Appellant had previously been granted by way of  discretionary  leave,
      did not represent 'precarious' status in  the  UK.  Such  argument  is
      contrary to the findings of the Upper  Tribunal  in  the  case  of  AM
      (s.117B) [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC) of 17 April 2015, promulgated some four
      weeks prior to the drafting  of  these  grounds  of  appeal.  Further,
      paragraph 54 of Alladin v [2014] EWCA Civ 1334,  referred  to  in  the
      Appellant's grounds of appeal, is not authority  for  the  proposition
      that discretionary leave to remain held by a minor child is not to  be
      treated as 'precarious leave'.  Paragraph 54 of the judgement in  that
      case merely contained  summary of a submission made by  the  Secretary
      of State for the Home Department; the issue  of  'precariousness'  was
      not considered in the decision of the Court itself, from paragraph  57
      onwards; and the issue under discussion was not the meaning of Part 5A
      NIAA 2002.

54    Ground 5(c) is entitled "Failure to  consider  other  relevant  public
      interest factors in the  proportionality  exercise."  This  ground  of
      appeal seeks to raise an argument that the Appellant was entitled to a
      'durable solution' in relation to his immigration status,  given  that
      he had previously been an unaccompanied asylum seeking child, and  has
      been in the care of the local authority. It  is  significant  to  note
      that no arguments in relation to this issue of law  were  advanced  to
      the First-tier Judge. I deal with these arguments fairly summarily. It
      is to be noted  that  although  a  letter  from  a  social  worker  of
      Northamptonshire County Council dated 12th of February 2013 was before
      the Judge at Annex K of the Respondent's bundle, that document  itself
      was more than two years out of date by the time of the appeal  hearing
      before the present Judge. Further, Ms Blair confirmed that  there  was
      before the Judge no copy of any local authority 'pathway plan'  as  to
      the Appellant's best interests or as to his proposed further education
      or future well-being. The principal authority relevant to  this  issue
      of  'durable  solutions'  for  former  unaccompanied  asylum   seeking
      children is JS (Afghanistan) [2013] UKUT 00568  (IAC)  which  includes
      the passage, (partially) quoted in the grounds of appeal, that:

           "3. For an unaccompanied asylum seeking child, the best  durable
           solution is to be reunited with his own family unless there  are
           good reasons  to  the  contrary.   Where  reunification  is  not
           possible and there are no adequate reception facilities  in  the
           home country, an appropriate durable solution may  be  to  grant
           discretionary leave during the remaining years of  minority  and
           then arrange a return to the country of origin. Where the  child
           is of a young age on arrival, cannot be reunited with his family
           and will spend many years in the host state during his  minority
           a durable solution may need to be  found  in  the  host  state."
           (Emphasis added)


55    The Appellant was 14 ï¿½ at the time that he was granted limited  leave,
      up to the age  of  17  ï¿½,  at  which  time  his  position  was  to  be
      reconsidered. That course of action seems to me to be consistent  with
      that part of JS which is highlighted above.


56    Further, headnote paragraph 4 pf JS continues:

           " Where the appellant is no longer a  minor,  the  duty  on  the
           Secretary of State under s.55 of the  Borders,  Immigration  and
           Citizenship Act 1999  no  longer  arises  but  when  making  the
           assessment of whether removal  would lead to a breach of article
           8 all relevant factors must be taken into account including age,
           background, length of residence in the UK,  family  and  general
           circumstances including any particular vulnerability and whether
           an appellant will have family or other adult support  on  return
           to his home country appropriate to his particular needs."

57    It seems to me that that was the task performed by the  Judge  in  the
      present case. I also note the observations of the  Upper  Tribunal  at
      paragraph 29 of JS:

           "It was not argued on behalf of the appellant that the fact that
           he is a former relevant  child  receiving  assistance  from  the
           local authority meant for that reason alone that he could not be
           removed.  In  our  judgment  any  such  a  contention  would  be
           unsustainable.  The resolution of  the  appellant's  immigration
           status depends not on whether he is in receipt of care under the
           provision of the Children Acts but on whether he is able to show
           an entitlement to remain in  accordance  with  the  law  or  the
           immigration rules."

 58   I find that no error of law is made out on  this  'durable  solutions'
      ground.

59    Ground 6 alleges that the Judge erred in law in failing to  take  into
      account the Article 8 rights of the witnesses who  gave  evidence,  in
      particular the Appellant's partner. It was argued that in  considering
      the proportionality of any interference with rights  under  Article  8
      ECHR, not  only  the  Appellant's  rights  under  Article  8  must  be
      considered, but the Article 8 rights of any other person as well - and
      the Appellant cites Beoku Betts [2009] 1 AC 115.

60    It is to be noted that the Judge held that  the  relationship  between
      the Appellant and his partner did not amount to family life, and there
      is no challenge to that finding. Nor is there  any  finding  that  the
      Appellant's relationship with any friend, former carer, or relative of
      such persons, amounted to family life. Any Article  8  rights  of  the
      Appellant or  of  others  potentially  affected  by  the  Respondent's
      decision must therefore be private life rights.

61    I find that the Appellant's  argument  is  misconceived.  Beoku  Betts
      concerned the Article 8 family life enjoyed between an  appellant  and
      others - "normally a spouse or minor children, with whom  that  family
      life is enjoyed" (para 4). Their Lordships  approved  the  proposition
      that in relation to family life, there is only one family life.

62    The corollary, in relation to private life, is that it  is  particular
      to the individual. No  one  person's  private  life  is  the  same  as
      another's. The Appellant's private life is not the  same  the  private
      lives of his friends. The grounds on which the  Appellant  may  resist
      his removal are that the decision is unlawful under  s.6  Human  Right
      Act 1998. I find  that  in  relation  to  private  life  issues,  that
      requires the consideration of his private  life  only,  not  those  of
      others. The  authority  of  Beoku  Betts  is  not  authority  for  the
      proposition advanced.

63    In any event, I find that the Judge did not leave out of  account  the
      potential effect of the decision on the Appellant's friends; see [53].
      The Appellant's suggestion that the Judge erred in law in  failing  to
      consider whether the Appellant's partner would be required  to  travel
      to Afghanistan to be with him is misconceived; in  the  light  of  the
      finding  that  no  family  life  existed   between   them,   no   such
      consideration was required.

64    To the extent  that  the  Appellant's  skeleton  argument  raises  any
      discreet argument not contained  within  the  Appellant's  grounds  of
      appeal, I decline to consider such  arguments,  on  the  grounds  that
      permission was not sought  or  granted  on  those  grounds.   Further,
      'Appendix One' to the Appellant's skeleton argument  is  a  discursive
      discussion on the law as to 'durable solutions'. It has the appearance
      of an academic article or seminar paper. It makes no reference to  the
      facts of the present Appellant's appeal or any  to  the  legal  issues
      raised in his particular appeal. Placing a court header at the top  of
      its front page does not make it relevant to the present  appeal,  and,
      other than to determine the nature of the document,  which I note  was
      not referred to in Ms Blair's oral submissions, I have ignored it.

65    I find that no  material  error  of  law  exists  within  the  Judge's
      decision. The grounds on which the appeal was brought were in  several
      respects misplaced and misleading.  The author should bear in mind the
      guidance in VHR (unmeritorious grounds) [2014]  UKUT  367  (IAC)  that
      appeals should not be mounted on the basis of  a  litany  of  forensic
      criticisms of particular findings of the First Tier  Tribunal,  whilst
      ignoring the basic legal test which the appellant has to meet.

      Decision

66    There being no material error of law in the  Judge's  decision,  I  do
      not set aside the decision.

67    The decision of the Judge is upheld.

68    The Appellant was granted anonymity throughout  these  proceedings  at
      the case management hearing. No  application  was  made  to  life  the
      order, and I direct Pursuant to Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
      (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/269)  that  no  report  of  these
      proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member of
      his family. This  direction  applies  to  the  Appellant  and  to  the
      Respondent. Failure to  comply  with  this  direction  could  lead  to
      contempt of court.
