               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellants:    Miss D Adler, Counsel, instructed by The Cardinal
Hume Centre
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Ahmed, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the  appeal  of  Ms  Anne  Iyabo  Kayode  Oyelohunu  against  a
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge M A Khan promulgated on 29  March
    2016.

2.   The appellant and her three children,  who  are  also  appellants,  are
    citizens of Nigeria.  The issue  under  appeal  was  the  rightness  or
    wrongness of the decision of the respondent  refusing  the  appellants'
    applications under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights
    for leave to remain in the UK.

3.   It is conceded quite properly and fairly by the Home Office  Presenting
    Officer, Ms Ahmed, that the decision contains an  error  of  law.   Put
    shortly, while the judge referred to part of paragraph 276ADE  relating
    to the twenty year  residence  requirement  in  respect  of  the  first
    appellant he said nothing about the position of children under  18  who
    have lived here for more than seven years.   He  has  not  referred  to
    Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act.

4.   We agree with Miss Adler, Counsel  for  the  appellants,  and  with  Ms
    Ahmed that the decision cannot stand.  Both Counsel invited us to remit
    the matter to the First-tier Tribunal in view of the fact that  a  full
    factual hearing will be required in this case.  We agree that  this  is
    the proper course of action.  We shall therefore allow the  appeal  and
    remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh decision.



Notice of Decision

The appeal against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  allowed  and
the matter is remitted to that Tribunal for the decision to be remade.

No anonymity direction is made.

                                          Sitting as an Upper Tribunal Judge
                                            (Immigration and Asylum Chamber)
