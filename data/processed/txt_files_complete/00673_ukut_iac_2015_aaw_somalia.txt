               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Gilbert, of counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

A failure to comply with  the  Senior  President's  Practice  Direction  may
affect the weight to be given to expert evidence. Any opinion  offered  that
is unsupported by a  demonstration  of  the  objectivity  and  comprehensive
review of material facts required of an  expert  witness  is  likely  to  be
afforded little weight by the Tribunal. In particular, a  witness  who  does
not engage with material facts or issues that might detract  from  the  view
being expressed risks being regarded as an informed advocate  for  the  case
of one of the parties to the proceedings rather than an  independent  expert
witness.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. Permission having been granted to appeal against the determination  of
      the First-tier Tribunal by which  his  appeal  against  a  deportation
      order was dismissed, the appellant's appeal came before Upper Tribunal
      Judge O'Connor on 13 July 2015. By a decision  dated  14  July,  Judge
      O'Connor found that the First-tier Tribunal had  made  errors  of  law
      such as to require the determination to be set aside. His reasons  for
      so finding are set out in the decision that is annexed  hereto.  Judge
      O'Connor said this about the circumstances leading to the decision  to
      make a deportation order:


           "The appellant has a lengthy history of  criminal  offending  in
           the United Kingdom. He was convicted of common assault in  2002,
           two sexual assaults and common assault in 2010, a  breach  of  a
           community order in  2010  and  for  both  failure  to  surrender
           (having been released on bail) and destroying/damaging  property
           in 2011.


           Most significantly, however, the appellant was convicted  on  27
           October 2011 of wounding with intent (to cause  grievous  bodily
           harm) and sentenced to a term of six years'  imprisonment.  This
           led the Secretary of State to make a decision to deport him ..."


      It might be observed, also, that in his sentencing remarks  the  judge
      who passed that prison sentence  said  that  if  not  for  the  prompt
      intervention of the medical services the appellant would have faced  a
      murder charge. He went on to say:


           "Time and again it is said by the courts  that  people  who  use
           knives in order to attack others must face substantial custodial
           sentences and by substantial I mean lengthy.


           This was on any view a sustained attack. You were determined  to
           mete out physical violence to (the victim). You  armed  yourself
           with a knife. You kicked the door of the living room open  where
           he had retreated and, as I say, you plunged the knife twice into
           his body..."


   2. For reasons that are not in dispute between the  parties,  it  is  not
      necessary to look any further into the determination of the First-tier
      Tribunal other than to say that their finding that  section  72(2)  of
      the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 applied in this  case
      stands, so that the appellant cannot succeed in his appeal  on  asylum
      grounds. Therefore, as Mr  Gilbert,  realistically,  does  not  pursue
      either any grounds founded upon rights protected by Article 8  of  the
      ECHR we are concerned only with the question of whether,  upon  return
      to Mogadishu, the appellant would be  subjected  to  ill-treatment  or
      would find himself living in  conditions  such  as  to  amount  to  an
      infringement of Article 3 of the ECHR.


   3. The appellant, who is a citizen of Somalia, was born in 1974 and so is
      now about 40 years old. He lived with  his  parents  and  siblings  in
      Mogadishu. They are of the Shanshiya clan, which is a sub clan of  the
      Benadiri and so a minority clan. That was a matter of  fact  initially
      in dispute but Mr Jarvis does not now pursue that challenge and so the
      appellant is to be considered to  be  of  the  clan  he  asserts.  The
      appellant's father was a merchant, selling shoes and  some  livestock.
      As the appellant confirmed in his oral evidence before us, the  family
      had the patronage of a local Hawiye man  as  a  result  of  which  the
      appellant's father prospered in his business  and  the  appellant  was
      able to attend school. They owned and lived in their own house,  which
      had six bedrooms.


   4. Despite that patronage from a majority clan  member,  the  appellant's
      family, like many others, felt unsafe as the civil war  of  the  early
      1990's took hold. They therefore left Mogadishu and moved to Marka  on
      the south coast of Mogadishu, where the appellant's  father  rented  a
      house and opened a new shop. Unfortunately, after two years or so, the
      fighting spread to Marka and so the family  moved  across  the  border
      into Kenya, where they lived in a refugee camp.

   5. In 1996 the appellant's parents decided to return to Mogadishu  taking
      the appellant and his siblings with them. He said that other relatives
      remained in the camp in Kenya. Despite the continuing  violence  being
      perpetrated in Somalia, and the  precarious  position,  generally,  of
      members of minority clans at that time in Somalia, the family was able
      to travel back to Mogadishu by bus. In  oral  evidence  the  appellant
      explained how this was possible, given that they were  of  a  minority
      clan and on that basis at extreme risk when passing through  the  many
      militia controlled checkpoints they encountered on their  journey.  He
      said that the bus  driver  bribed  his  way  through  the  checkpoints
      outside Mogadishu and, when asked  about  how  they  got  through  the
      checkpoints within Mogadishu, the appellant explained that:

           "... the man who father trusted was waiting for us there."

   6. The appellant explained that when his father decided that they  should
      return to Mogadishu, he contacted the man  of  the  Hawiye  clan,  his
      connection with whom had enabled him to run his business  and  to  own
      property in Mogadishu, and made with  him  certain  arrangements.  The
      family would return and this man had agreed to  buy  their  house  for
      $40,000. The appellant's father would then rent a house  and  start  a
      new business. Unfortunately, when they arrived in Mogadishu they found
      that others from a majority clan had moved into their house and  taken
      it over and so, for a few months, they stayed at the home of  the  man
      trusted by his father who had agreed to buy the house. After that  man
      had secured vacant possession, the sale proceeded and so the appellant
      and his family moved into a rented house.


   7. However, the appellant had described also that when he and his brother
      left Mogadishu in 2008, the family was then living "in an IDP camp" in
      Mogadishu. In oral evidence he explained that this was because  "there
      was no peace". That decision was certainly not driven by a shortage of
      funds because they had the proceeds of the sale  of  their  house.  It
      emerged in evidence that  the  "IDP  camp"  was  a  vacant  government
      building, in which the appellant's  parents  remained  resident  after
      their two sons had departed. Each son received from their parents  the
      sum of $5,000 to fund their journey, their parents retaining for their
      own use the remaining $30,000.

   8. The appellant, who was provided with a Danish passport by  the  agent,
      travelled to an airport to  the  north  of  Mogadishu  from  where  he
      travelled  by  air  to  the  United  Kingdom.   He   claimed   asylum,
      unsuccessfully, on arrival and again, in a false  name  in  2006.  His
      detailed immigration and appeal history is well known to  the  parties
      and it is not necessary to rehearse it here.

   9. It is Mr Gilbert's submission that the appellant should succeed in his
      appeal on the basis  that  he  falls  with  the  category  of  persons
      identified in MOJ & Ors (Return to Mogadishu) Somalia CG  [2014]  UKUT
      00442 (IAC) as being entitled to international protection in that  the
      appellant will be returning with no clan or  family  support;  not  in
      receipt of remittances from  abroad  and  with  no  real  prospect  of
      securing access to  a  livelihood  on  return.  This  is  because  the
      appellant's minority clan will not be able to assist him  and  without
      clan or family support he will be unable to find work and so will find
      himself destitute and living in an IDP camp in  conditions  that  will
      fall below what is permissible in terms of the protection provided  by
      Article 3.

  10. Bringing matters up to date, the appellant confirmed that  his  father
      died in 2001 after which his mother remained  in  the  same  building,
      described by him as "living in a refugee camp". He kept in touch  with
      his mother until her death in 2013. He said he lost his faith not long
      after he arrived in the United Kingdom and so he  does  not  go  to  a
      mosque. His brother  now  lives  in  Birmingham.  Last  September  the
      appellant told him that he had become an atheist.  He  said  that  his
      brother "did not like that" and has cut off all ties with him. In oral
      evidence the appellant said that he  had  continued  to  talk  to  his
      sister in law and that she was beginning to understand his position.

  11. Finally, the appellant says that he would be at risk on return from  a
      revenge attack, because the man he stabbed in committing  the  offence
      for which he has been imprisoned is also a Somali national and as news
      travels fast between the  United  Kingdom  and  Mogadishu  this  man's
      family would find out where is and would attack and possibly kill him.

  12. In Mr Gilbert's submission, the  appellant's  difficulties  on  return
      will be exacerbated by other factors. He has  a  history  of  criminal
      offending, including  sexual  assault,  a  category  of  offence  that
      offends social mores in Somalia. He has also a history of addiction to
      alcohol and, on that basis as well, he  will  attract  severe  censure
      and, as alcohol is illegal but available, this  will  also  act  as  a
      barrier to securing accommodation and employment. Mr Gilbert  has  set
      out in his skeleton argument a detailed analysis of all  of  the  risk
      factors he identifies and I have had careful regard to all that he has
      written.

  13. Mr Gilbert relies upon the country guidance provided by  MOJ  and  Ors
      and upon a lengthy written report and supplementary report provided by
      Ms Mary Harper who  was  one  of  three  witnesses  presented  by  the
      appellants in MOJ  &  Ors  as  expert  country  witnesses.  Mr  Jarvis
      describes Ms Harper's reports as "extraordinary" in that they are,  in
      his submission, lacking the objectivity demanded of the evidence of  a
      person put forward as an expert witness and because, he  submits,  she
      has advanced the same opinions as were rejected by the Tribunal in MOJ
      & Ors, substantially relying upon the same  material  upon  which  her
      evidence in 2014 was based and she has simply  expressed  disagreement
      with or simply ignored the findings in the country guidance offered in
      MOJ & Ors where they are contrary to the opinion she expresses.

  14. Mr Jarvis invited the Tribunal to  categorise  these  reports  not  as
      expert evidence  at  all  but  as  the  expression  of  an  inaccurate
      journalistic view that should be given no weight at all. On the  other
      hand, Mr Gilbert points out that the Tribunal in MOJ  &  Ors  did  not
      reject Ms Harper's evidence in its entirety  and  he  emphasises  also
      that in the present reports Ms Harper deals  with  areas  outside  the
      focus of the country guidance given previously.

  15. I shall examine those competing submissions below but  as  Mr  Gilbert
      correctly points out, the appellant's case is not founded  exclusively
      upon Ms Harper's evidence and so, even if her evidence is not regarded
      as helpful, that does not mean that on that account alone  the  appeal
      must fail.

The country guidance: MOJ & Ors

  16. This is a substantial decision of the Upper Tribunal, running to  more
      than 400 paragraphs. The Tribunal  had  before  it  a  vast  array  of
      documentary evidence as is  identified  in  an  annex,  that  list  of
      materials extending to more  than  35  pages.  This  country  guidance
      decision was considered  recently  by  the  ECtHR  in  R.H.  v  Sweden
      (Application no 4601/14), published on 10 September 2015. At paragraph
      67 the Court said that:


           "... Given the high volume of oral and written evidence examined
           by the Tribunal, the Court considers that its assessment must be
           accorded great weight."


      The Court set out the country guidance provided by MOJ & Ors and  went
      on to adopt and apply it in dismissing the application before it.


  17. The headnote reproduced below is the Tribunal's attempt to distil  key
      aspects of the guidance provided into a concise summary but this  does
      not, as we shall see, cover the full extent of the  reasoned  findings
      made:
           "(i)              The country guidance issues addressed in this
                 determination are not identical to those  engaged  with  by
                 the Tribunal in  AMM  and  others  (conflict;  humanitarian
                 crisis; returnees; FGM) Somalia CG [2011] UKUT  445  (IAC).
                 Therefore, where country guidance has  been  given  by  the
                 Tribunal in AMM in respect of issues not addressed in  this
                 determination then  the  guidance  provided  by  AMM  shall
                 continue to have effect.
           (ii)             Generally,  a  person  who  is  "an  ordinary
                 civilian" (i.e. not associated with  the  security  forces;
                 any aspect of government or official administration or  any
                 NGO  or  international  organisation)   on   returning   to
                 Mogadishu after a period of absence will face no real  risk
                 of  persecution  or  risk  of  harm  such  as  to   require
                 protection under Article 3 of the ECHR or Article 15(c)  of
                 the Qualification Directive. In particular, he will not  be
                 at real risk  simply  on  account  of  having  lived  in  a
                 European location for a period of time of being viewed with
                 suspicion either by the authorities as a possible supporter
                 of Al Shabaab or by Al Shabaab as an  apostate  or  someone
                 whose Islamic integrity has been compromised by living in a
                 Western country.
           (iii)            There has been durable change in the sense that
                 the Al Shabaab withdrawal from Mogadishu  is  complete  and
                 there is no real  prospect  of  a  re-established  presence
                 within the city. That was not the case at the time  of  the
                 country guidance given by the Tribunal in AMM.
           (iv)            The level of civilian casualties, excluding non-
                 military casualties that clearly  fall  within  Al  Shabaab
                 target  groups  such  as  politicians,   police   officers,
                 government officials and those  associated  with  NGOs  and
                 international   organisations,    cannot    be    precisely
                 established by the statistical evidence which is incomplete
                 and unreliable. However, it is established by the  evidence
                 considered as a whole that there has been  a  reduction  in
                 the level of civilian casualties since 2011, largely due to
                 the cessation of confrontational warfare  within  the  city
                 and  Al  Shabaab's  resort  to  asymmetrical   warfare   on
                 carefully  selected  targets.    The   present   level   of
                 casualties does not amount to a sufficient risk to ordinary
                 civilians such as to represent an Article 15(c) risk.
           (v)             It is open to an ordinary citizen of  Mogadishu
                 to reduce further still his personal exposure to  the  risk
                 of "collateral damage" in being caught up in an Al  Shabaab
                 attack that was not targeted at him by avoiding  areas  and
                 establishments that are clearly identifiable as  likely  Al
                 Shabaab targets, and it is not unreasonable for him  to  do
                 so.
           (vi)            There is no real risk of forced recruitment  to
                 Al Shabaab for civilian citizens  of  Mogadishu,  including
                 for recent returnees from the West.
           (vii)           A person returning to Mogadishu after  a  period
                 of absence will look to his nuclear family, if he  has  one
                 living in  the  city,  for  assistance  in  re-establishing
                 himself and securing a livelihood. Although a returnee  may
                 also seek assistance from his  clan  members  who  are  not
                 close relatives, such help is only likely to be forthcoming
                 for majority clan  members,  as  minority  clans  may  have
                 little to offer.
           (viii)        The significance of clan membership in  Mogadishu
                 has changed. Clans now provide, potentially, social support
                 mechanisms  and  assist   with   access   to   livelihoods,
                 performing less of a protection function  than  previously.
                 There are no clan militias in Mogadishu, no clan  violence,
                 and  no  clan  based  discriminatory  treatment,  even  for
                 minority clan members.
           (ix)            If it is accepted that a person facing a return
                 to Mogadishu after a  period  of  absence  has  no  nuclear
                 family or close relatives in the city to assist him in  re-
                 establishing himself on return, there will  need  to  be  a
                 careful assessment  of  all  of  the  circumstances.  These
                 considerations will include, but are not limited to:
                 �       circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;
                 �       length of absence from Mogadishu;
                 �        family  or  clan  associations  to  call  upon  in
                    Mogadishu;
                 �       access to financial resources;
                 �       prospects of securing a livelihood, whether that be
                    employment or self employment;
                 �       availability of remittances from abroad;
                 �       means of support  during  the  time  spent  in  the
                    United Kingdom;
                 �       why his ability to fund the journey to the West  no
                    longer enables an appellant to secure financial  support
                    on return.
           (x)             Put another way, it  will  be  for  the  person
                 facing return to explain why he would not be able to access
                 the economic opportunities that have been produced  by  the
                 economic boom, especially  as  there  is  evidence  to  the
                 effect that returnees are taking jobs  at  the  expense  of
                 those who have never been away.
           (xi)            It will, therefore, only be those with no  clan
                 or family support who will not be in receipt of remittances
                 from abroad and who  have  no  real  prospect  of  securing
                 access to a livelihood on return who will face the prospect
                 of living in circumstances  falling  below  that  which  is
                 acceptable in humanitarian protection terms.
           (xii)          The evidence indicates clearly that  it  is  not
                 simply those who originate  from  Mogadishu  that  may  now
                 generally  return  to  live  in  the  city  without   being
                 subjected to an Article 15(c) risk or facing a real risk of
                 destitution. On the other hand, relocation in Mogadishu for
                 a person of a minority clan  with no former  links  to  the
                 city, no access to funds and no other form of clan,  family
                 or social support is unlikely to be realistic  as,  in  the
                 absence of means to establish  a  home  and  some  form  of
                 ongoing financial support there will  be  a  real  risk  of
                 having  no   alternative   but   to   live   in   makeshift
                 accommodation within an IDP camp  where  there  is  a  real
                 possibility of having to live in conditions  that will fall
                 below acceptable humanitarian standards."
  18.  Mr Gilbert draws on other references and findings that did  not  find
      their way into the headnote. Thus:


   a. at para 343, the Tribunal cited from a 2014 UNHCR report "that persons
      belonging to minority clans... remain at particular disadvantage". But
      here  the  full  extract  is  necessary  to  give  context   to   that
      observation:


                 "Persons  belonging  to   minority   clans...   remain   at
                 particular disadvantage in Mogadishu... There remains a low
                 sense of Somali social and  ethical  obligation  to  assist
                 individuals from weak  lineages  and  social  groups.  This
                 stands in stark contrast to the powerful and non-negotiable
                 obligation Somalis have to  assist  members  of  their  own
                 lineage."


           From which it can be seen that the disadvantage  being  referred
           to relates to  a  lower  sense  of  obligation  to  assist  clan
           members.


   b. At para 353 that "it may be that, like other residents  of  Mogadishu,
      he would be more likely to succeed in accessing a livelihood with  the
      support of a clan or nuclear family."  But,  again,  that  observation
      must be read together with the sentence that precedes it:


                 "For those reasons we do not accept  Dr  Hoehne's  evidence
                 that it is only a tiny elite that derives any benefit  from
                 the "economic boom". Inevitably, jobs have been created and
                 the evidence discloses no reason why a returnee would  face
                 discriminatory obstacles to competing for such  employment.
                 It may be that, like other residents of Mogadishu, he would
                 be more likely to succeed in accessing  a  livelihood  with
                 the support of a clan or nuclear family."


   c. At para 342 "for a returnee to Mogadishu today, clan membership is not
      a potential risk factor but something which is relevant to the  extent
      to which he will be able  to  receive  assistance  in  re-establishing
      himself on return, especially if he has no close relatives to turn  to
      upon arrival. There remains an aspect of protection to be derived from
      clan membership."
           However, again, that finding was qualified by the final sentence
           of that paragraph, in which the Tribunal said,  explaining  that
           even for those who can expectantly look to clans for support:
                 "But this source of assistance must not be  overstated.  As
                 explained by Ms Harper, in her oral evidence,  in  response
                 to a question concerning what help a returnee might  expect
                 from his clan:
                       "None at present. If you arrive in Mogadishu  and  do
                       not know anyone at all, you might  start  asking  for
                       fellow clan members in the hope that  they  might  do
                       more for you than others. But you  could  not  expect
                       anything from them.""
  19.  Next, Mr Gilbert draws upon the COIR of March 2015, which  of  course
      post dates the decision of MOJ and Ors. He points to para  1.3.4  that
      states that minority  clan  members,  who  usually  lack  the  support
      networks available to those of  majority  clans  as  a  result  suffer
      discrimination. Mr Gilbert relies upon the observation  that  follows:
      "and have experienced human rights abuses..." but that is expressed in
      the past tense, which is confirmation of that which is not in dispute.




  20. Para 1.3.6 of  the  COIR  does  not  say,  as  the  skeleton  argument
      suggests, that minority clan  members  will  find  themselves  in  IDP
      camps, simply that those who do may find themselves  exposed  to  ill-
      treatment. It is highly relevant in  this  particular  case  that  the
      appellant's mother, with whom he remained in contact until  her  death
      in 2013, had been living in what the  appellant  has  referred  to  as
      either an IDP camp or a refugee camp for well over ten years since she
      became a widow yet no suggestion has  been  made  that  she  was  ever
      subjected to ill-treatment.

  21. Mr Gilbert draws attention to other  reports  also,  but  where  those
      reports were before the Tribunal in MOJ & Ors or are based upon source
      material that was, it is not necessary to discuss it further as it  is
      subsumed within the guidance given.

Evidence of Ms Mary Harper

  22. Ms Harper, who describes herself at the head of her reports as:


                    "BBC Africa Editor and Somalia Expert
      Fellow of The Rift Valley Institute and the Heritage Institute of
                               Policy Studies
     Author of Getting Somalia Wrong? Faith, Hope and War in a Shattered
                                   State"

      has produced two reports for this appeal. The first is dated  4  March
      2015 and runs to 22 pages and the second, an  Addendum  to  the  first
      report, is dated 14 October  2015  and  is  produced  in  response  to
      written questions posed by  the  respondent  arising  from  the  first
      report.


  23. Given the challenge raised by Mr Jarvis to  the  objectivity  of  Miss
      Harper's evidence, before descending into a  detailed  examination  of
      those reports it is helpful to look at what is required of  an  expert
      witness.


  24. In MOJ & Ors the Tribunal said this:
        "Thus in the contemporary era the subject of  expert  evidence  and
        experts' reports is heavily regulated. The  principles,  rules  and
        criteria highlighted above are of general application.  They  apply
        to experts giving evidence at every tier of the  legal  system.  In
        the specific sphere of the Upper Tribunal (Immigration  and  Asylum
        Chamber), these standards apply fully, without  any  qualification.
        They are reflected in the Senior President's Practice Direction  No
        10 (2010) which, in paragraph 10, lays  particular  emphasis  on  a
        series of duties. We summarise these duties thus:
              i) to provide information and express opinions  independently,
                 uninfluenced by the litigation;
             ii) to consider all material facts, including those which might
                 detract from the expert witness' opinion ;
            iii) to be objective and unbiased;
             iv)   to  avoid  trespass  into  the  prohibited  territory  of
                 advocacy;
              v) to be fully informed;
             vi)  to act within  the  confines  of  the  witness's  area  of
                 expertise; and
            vii)  to modify, or abandon  one's view, where appropriate."
  25. A witness, if put forward as an expert witness, will not be treated as
      such if he or she does not  meet  the  requirements  demanded  by  the
      Senior President's Practice Direction. That does not mean that his  or
      her evidence falls to be disregarded, but any opinion offered that  is
      unsupported by a demonstration of the  objectivity  and  comprehensive
      review of material facts required of an expert witness is likely to be
      afforded little weight by the Tribunal. In particular, a  witness  who
      does not engage with material facts or issues that might detract  from
      the view being expressed risks being regarded as an informed  advocate
      for the case of one of the parties to the proceedings rather  than  an
      independent expert witness.


  26. In my judgment Mr Jarvis is correct to say that  Ms  Harper's  reports
      are quite remarkable. In short, she maintains the views  and  opinions
      she expressed in her evidence before the Tribunal in  2014  and  where
      those opinions are contrary to the country guidance that resulted, she
      either  expresses  disagreement  or  simply  disregards  the   country
      guidance altogether.

  27. She insists that some areas of Mogadishu  "still  harbour  significant
      elements of the Islamist group Al Shabaab" whereas the Tribunal  found
      that the withdrawal of Al Shabaab from the capital  was  complete  and
      durable. At paragraph 6 of her first report she asserts as if it  were
      an established fact that the  appellant's  physical  appearance  would
      readily disclose the fact that he is of the Reer Hamar and  so  "would
      put him at immediate risk of ill-treatment as he would be perceived by
      others to be a member of a minority clan". At paragraph 337 of  MOJ  &
      Ors the Tribunal rejected that view, finding that:

           "The evidence establishes clearly that, in Mogadishu,  there  is
           no inter-clan violence taking place and no real risk of  serious
           discriminatory treatment  being  experienced  on  the  basis  of
           clan."


      And in the headnote:


           "There are no clan militias in Mogadishu, no clan violence,  and
           no clan based discriminatory treatment, even for  minority  clan
           members."

  28.  At paragraph 6.3 of her  report,  Ms  Harper  draws  upon  the  World
      Directory of Minority Groups and Indigenous Peoples, in which  a  view
      was  expressed  that  minority   clans   "have   remained   especially
      vulnerable,  even  in  areas  where  stability  has  improved".  That,
      however, was based upon a report written in  2011  and  so  is  simply
      worthless in informing a discussion of conditions in Mogadishu today.

  29. Next, seeking to illustrate her view that minority clans continued  to
      suffer "continued prejudice and disproportionate violence"  she  cites
      an incident of an attack upon a  minority  clan  settlement  in  which
      people lost their lives. But as this  occurred  in  Jowhar,  50  miles
      north of Mogadishu and took place in November 2013, it  is  impossible
      to see how that is relevant to  an  assessment  of  the  situation  of
      members of a minority clan living in Mogadishu, a place from which  Al
      Shabaab have completed their withdrawal. Ms Harper does recognise this
      difficulty but concludes:

           "Although this kind  of  violence,  which  specifically  targets
           minority  clans,  has  not  to  my  knowledge  occurred  on  any
           significant scale in Mogadishu, it is possible that it  will  do
           in the near future."


      This  speculative  view  is  based  upon  no  sound  evidential  basis
      whatever. It is remarkable that the witness feels able to express such
      a view that requires for it to be accepted a  departure  from  country
      guidance without offering anything even approaching a proper basis  to
      do so. In my judgment this is not the expression of an expert view but
      a journalistic opinion by someone with personal knowledge of the  city
      who speaks of what she expects to be the case,  even  if  others  have
      expressed a different view, and its  significance  is  to  demonstrate
      that very little weight can be placed upon this view expressed by  the
      witness in this report.

  30. Similarly, in the paragraphs that followed, Ms Harper  speaks  of  the
      risks posed by clan militias in Mogadishu whereas the clear finding of
      the Tribunal in MOJ & Ors was that  there  were  no  longer  any  clan
      militias operating in the capital.

  31. There are examples of Miss Harper simply disregarding the findings  of
      the Tribunal as to conditions in Mogadishu  and  reiterating  her  own
      view, despite that having been rejected. At paragraph 7 of  her  first
      report Ms Harper says:

           "I believe that Al Shabaab would try to execute  or  assassinate
           (the appellant) if it discovered he was an atheist."


      But the Tribunal found, in  MOJ,  that  no  such  "executions"  by  Al
      Shabaab take place in Mogadishu. Miss  Harper  does  not  point  to  a
      single example of this having happened in the capital since Al Shabaab
      completed their withdrawal from the capital and so,  once  again,  her
      opinion is wholly out of step with the position as it has  been  found
      to be and she offers no basis at all to depart from  the  findings  of
      the Tribunal in this respect.

  32. Ms Harper  records  in  her  report  conversations  with  unidentified
      sources in Mogadishu who:


           "displayed hostility to the idea of people  with  a  history  of
           criminal  convictions  being  deported   to   Somalia....   This
           suggested a hostile predisposition towards such individuals from
           a wide range of society in Mogadishu. They said such individuals
           would be rejected by their families, if indeed they had families
           in Mogadishu. This would lead to their isolation; they may  have
           to live in the streets. This might increase  the  likelihood  of
           them joining Al Shabaab..."


      This evidence chimes with her opinion  as  advanced  in  her  evidence
      before the Tribunal in MOJ & Ors:
           "Ms Harper said in oral evidence:
                "If the family unit is there in Mogadishu,  if  that  person
                was involved with criminal activities in  the  UK  they  may
                reject them. Some families live  in  igloos  or  smashed  up
                buildings. The immediate family would I believe receive that
                person.""
      In rejecting her evidence, the Tribunal said this:


           "Ms Harper made clear that she disagreed with the evidence given
           by Dr Hoehne to the effect that an "ordinary" conviction in  the
           United Kingdom would have little or no significance in  Somalia,
           although offences involving drugs might be  different.  However,
           when invited to give any example of a returnee who  upon  return
           was shunned by relatives on this account she was  unable  to  do
           so. Therefore, this is yet another example of an  opinion  being
           offered that is simply unsupported by any actual evidence of  it
           occurring, being based instead upon what  the  witness  believes
           would be the case."


  33. Addressing next the  difficulty  the  appellant  would  experience  in
      accessing a livelihood on return to  Mogadishu,  it  was  Ms  Harper's
      opinion, expressed at para 10.2 of her first report, that it would  be
      extremely  difficult  for  him  to  secure  accommodation,   food   or
      employment:


           "... because he has the physical appearance of  a  member  of  a
           minority clan, has little education  and  is  not  part  of  the
           Somali "middle class..."


      Once again this flies in the face of the  country  guidance  in  place
      without any attempt being made to justify departure from it.  In MOJ &
      Ors the Tribunal addressed this point directly:

           "It is beyond doubt that there has been huge inward  investment,
           large-scale construction projects and vibrant business activity.
           Land values are  said  to  be  "rocketing"  and  entrepreneurial
           members of the diaspora with access to funding are returning  in
           significant numbers in the confident  expectation  of  launching
           successful business projects. The question to  be  addressed  is
           what, if any, benefit does this deliver for so called  "ordinary
           returnees" who are not themselves wealthy businessmen or  highly
           skilled professionals employed by such people."


      The conclusion reached concerning the view that economic opportunities
      were available only for "the elite", at para 349, was this:


           "This is a view that is not altogether easy to understand and we
           are unable to agree with it.  The  evidence  is  of  substantial
           inward investment in construction projects and of  entrepreneurs
           returning to  Mogadishu  to  invest  in  business  activity.  In
           particular we heard evidence about hotels and restaurants and  a
           resurgence  of  the  hospitality  industry  as  well   as   taxi
           businesses, bus services, drycleaners, electronics stores and so
           on.  The  evidence   speaks   of   construction   projects   and
           improvements  in  the  city's   infrastructure   such   as   the
           installation of some solar powered street lighting. It does not,
           perhaps, need much in the way of  direct  evidence  to  conclude
           that jobs such as working  as  building  labourers,  waiters  or
           drivers or assistants in  retail  outlets  are  unlikely  to  be
           filled by the tiny minority that represents "the elite".


  34. Ms Harper simply ignores this reasoning and so we do not know on  what
      basis she departs from it.


  35. There are many other examples of  such  difficulties  in  Ms  Harper's
      report. At paragraph 11.2 of her  report  she  opines  that  from  the
      moment the appellant arrives at Mogadishu airport he:

           "... would be  vulnerable  to  abuse  or  attack  by  criminals,
           militias, government  troops,  African  Union  soldiers  and  Al
           Shabaab. A returnee from Europe or the US would be  presumed  to
           have money or access to money  through  remittances,  and  would
           therefore be at risk of being robbed, or abducted  or  subjected
           to threats of violence for the purpose of extortion."


      Inevitably, citizens of Mogadishu will on occasion be the  victims  of
      crime just as they are in London  or  New  York.  However,  Ms  Harper
      offers  no  examples  of  this  ever  having  happened  in  a   manner
      attributable to the fact of a return from Europe. Once again, this  is
      an example of Miss Harper saying what she thinks would  happen  rather
      than giving evidence of something  that  does  generally  happen.  She
      attributes as her source for this observation  "Current  Anthropology,
      Embarking on an Anthropology of  Removal  by  Nathalie  Peutz,  a  PHD
      candidate in a work published in 2006. This was based  upon  fieldwork
      carried out as long ago as 2002.

  36. At para 11 of her first report Ms Harper asserts that:


           "Al Shabaab believes returnees from the West to be in a state of
           apostasy,  and  therefore  subject  to  punishment.  The   group
           considers as a possible spy anyone returning from the  West  and
           executes those it finds guilty of spying."


      Yet again, this was her view before the Tribunal in MOJ  &  Ors  which
      the Tribunal expressly rejected at para 374:


           "We are satisfied that the  evidence  does  not  establish  that
           "ordinary civilians" including diaspora returnees  are  targeted
           by anyone. Specifically, we are satisfied that the evidence does
           not establish that "ordinary civilians" including returnees, are
           targeted by Al Shabaab or the authorities or criminal  elements.
           We are satisfied that it matters not that  a  returnee  who  has
           been absent for some considerable time would be recognisable  as
           such by his dress, behaviour or language."


  37. It is not just what is in Ms Harper's report that is  remarkable  but,
      given that she offers it as an objective view of current conditions it
      is remarkable for one particular omission. In August of 2015 Mogadishu
      hosted for the first time an International Book Fair. This was a 3-day
      event attended by a large number of people  who  travelled  from  many
      destinations to attend. The event, by all accounts, was a success  and
      those involved were proud of what had been achieved. Yet the fact that
      there is no mention of this event in Ms Harper's report constitutes  a
      strong indication that she has sought not to  emphasise  any  positive
      aspect of life in Mogadishu today.


  38. It is not in doubt that she was aware of the event. We know  that  she
      was because her article for the BBC has attracted indignant complaints
      from those involved, because of the  negative  view  expressed  of  an
      event that others considered to be  an  important  success  story  for
      modern Mogadishu as it emerges from the  problems  of  the  past.  The
      report produced by the respondent includes:

           "Angry Somalia took on  twitter  #SomeTellMaryHarper  after  her
           article on Mogadishu  International  Book  Fair  dubbed  "Somali
           authors defy militants" was published.
           Somalis on twitter believe  BBC  Africa  editor  new  story  was
           biased and  did  not  highlight  the  real  environment  in  the
           recuperating country."


      Complaint was made also that Ms Harper included in the report of  this
      event a photograph of "horrifying scenes  at  Mogadishu  hotel  attack
      earlier this year" when there was no suggestion from any  source  that
      the book fair event in fact attracted any adverse  attention  from  Al
      Shabaab or anyone else[1].


  39. The respondent points out that this was not the only omission from her
      report of something that might expected to be included. Given  that  a
      key issue in this appeal was the question  of  whether  the  appellant
      would be able to secure employment  on  return  to  Mogadishu,  it  is
      significant that laws have recently been passed  restricting  reliance
      on foreign labour in a bid to encourage a higher level  of  employment
      of young Somalis who will often be  seeking  lower  grade  employment.
      Evidence of this, which has been provided by the  respondent,  is  not
      mentioned by Ms Harper.


  40.  In  her  supplemental  report,  addressing  questions  posed  by  the
      respondent, Ms Harper further addresses three topics: the availability
      of alcohol in Somalia as well as treatment for alcoholism; the  likely
      response to atheism and to those returning  after  having  acquired  a
      history of criminal offending. In so  doing  she  explained  that  she
      relied mainly upon mainly unidentified but "tried and tested"  sources
      who she has worked with in the past in her career of journalism.  But,
      as was observed by Mr Jarvis, the assessment of the reliability  of  a
      source is a task for the Tribunal  and  not  for  a  witness  offering
      evidence to it and, if the sources are not revealed, and not even  the
      notes kept of any conversations with those sources are produced, it is
      hard to see that very much weight can be  afforded  to  views  founded
      upon information provided by such sources.

  41. An example of this is to be found in what Ms  Harper  says  about  the
      absence of treatment for alcoholics. Although  on  this  occasion  the
      source is identified, a named doctor working at a Mogadishu  hospital,
      as we do not know the questions asked of that person, nor the  answers
      actually provided, it is impossible to understand what is meant by the
      reported  response  that  this  particular  hospital  does  not  offer
      "specialised" treatment for alcoholics. We simply do not know  whether
      that means that no treatment at all is available or that there  is  no
      specific clinic for alcohol related conditions.

  42. In this section of her supplementary report Ms Harper cites a  comment
      made to her by another unidentified journalist in Mogadishu  that  "if
      you are drunk and you walk in the streets, children will come out  and
      stone you to death". Yet she points to not one single example of  this
      ever having happened. In fact, her  evidence  that  alcohol,  although
      illegal, is available if one knows where to look and that young people
      are sometimes arrested by police for being drunk  on  the  streets  on
      Friday and Saturday nights when returning from parties and that  there
      are areas of Mogadishu where it is known that alcoholics congregate to
      drink suggests that in fact people do not get stoned to death  on  the
      streets.

  43. Dealing next with  a  question  about  the  appellant's  prospects  of
      employment in Mogadishu, Ms Harper says:

           "There are few employment opportunities, and  those  that  exist
           depend upon contacts, clan, family  affiliation  and  marketable
           skills.
           ...
           In my view it would be almost impossible for (the appellant)  to
           find unskilled work in Mogadishu due to  the tens  of  thousands
           of other people looking for similar employment, most of whom are
           long  terms  residents  of  the  city  with  clan   and   family
           contacts..."

      I will return to this issue below, when making an  assessment  of  the
      appellant's prospects of securing a livelihood, but it can be observed
      that in reaching the conclusion she does, Ms Harper has no  regard  to
      the vocational qualifications the appellant  has  acquired,  including
      City  and  Guilds  certificates  in  wall  and  floor  tiling  and   a
      qualification in information technology. Nor does she have  regard  to
      the evidence, discussed in MOJ and Ors, that returnees are said to  be
      taking jobs at the expense of long term residents who have never  been
      away, or the evidence that many of the unemployed youth  of  Mogadishu
      are simply not looking for work, being content  to  live  idle  lives,
      while being in receipt of support from remittances from  abroad,  food
      and other aid  available  and,  in  some  cases,  rental  income  from
      agricultural land that they do not wish to work themselves.


  44. Addressing next the risks faced by the appellant as  an  atheist,  she
      quoted unnamed journalists as saying that  this  would  amount  to  "a
      death penalty". She provides one example of Al Shabaab having executed
      a man "for allegedly insulting the prophet". But, although  this  took
      place in April 2015, Miss  Harper  does  not  say  that  this  was  an
      incident that occurred not in Mogadishu but in  Jamame  in  the  Lower
      Juba region which is some distance away from Mogadishu and an area  in
      which, unlike in the capital, Al Shabaab maintain a physical presence.
      Therefore, it is impossible to see how this can, properly,  be  relied
      upon as evidence of what might occur in Mogadishu.


  45. As for the risk from the general community, Ms Harper says that if the
      appellant refused to pray or to go to the mosque:

           "... I believe people in Mogadishu would become very  suspicious
           of him and possibly accuse  him  of  being  an  atheist  or  non
           believer."


      The difficulty with this is  that,  once  again,  it  is  an  entirely
      speculative view unsupported by any evidential foundation. Mr  Gilbert
      confirmed that nothing is disclosed by the evidence to  indicate  that
      residents of Mogadishu are under  any  obligation  to  attend  mosque.
      Indeed, there is  a  very  significant  Kenyan  workforce  present  in
      Mogadishu and that country is a predominantly  Christian  one  and  so
      there will be many people who will not attend any mosque.

  46. For all of these reasons, I conclude that I am able to  attach  little
      weight to Ms Harper's report as the evidence of an expert witness. Her
      report lacks the objectivity demanded and her review  of  the  country
      information available is selective. Where she expresses opinions  that
      conflict with current country guidance, she offers no basis upon which
      her own opinions should properly be accepted  to  prevail.  Therefore,
      this evidence stands as the view of  an  experienced  journalist  with
      personal experience of the city from her regular visits.  It is not to
      be disregarded, but considered in the round  with  all  of  the  other
      evidence available and in the light of current country guidance.

   Assessment of this appellant's position upon return to Mogadishu


  47. In reaching a conclusion upon the question of  whether  the  appellant
      will find himself upon return to Mogadishu in circumstances such as to
      fall below the threshold of Article 3 of the ECHR  it  is  helpful  to
      address the questions posed by the applicable country guidance, so far
      as they are relevant in this case. It is accepted that  the  appellant
      faces the prospect of being returned after an  absence  of  17  years;
      that he has no nuclear family or other close relatives in the city and
      that he is a member of  a  minority  clan.  Therefore  an  enquiry  is
      required of all of the circumstances, including:


   a. his circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;
   b. the length of absence from Mogadishu;
   c. the clan associations he may be able to call upon in Mogadishu;
   d. access to financial resources;
   e. the prospects of him securing a livelihood, whether that be employment
      or self employment;
   f. the availability of remittances from abroad;
   g. his means of support during the time spent in the United Kingdom;
   h. why his ability to fund the journey to the West no longer  enables  an
      appellant to secure financial support on return.
      The country guidance reminds us that it will be for the appellant  to
      explain why he would not be able to access the economic  opportunities
      that have been produced by the economic boom, especially as  there  is
      evidence to the effect that returnees are taking jobs at  the  expense
      of those who have never been away. The country guidance concludes that
      it will, therefore, only be those with no clan or family  support  who
      will not be in receipt of remittances from abroad and who have no real
      prospect of securing access to a livelihood on return  who  will  face
      the prospect of living in circumstances falling below  that  which  is
      acceptable in humanitarian protection terms.
  48. The circumstances of this appellant before he left Mogadishu have some
      significance for several reasons. First, his father was  able  to  run
      his business in Mogadishu and accumulate the capital that enabled  him
      to acquire a valuable house with six bedrooms because the  family  had
      the patronage of a member of the dominant majority clan  in  the  area
      who was sufficiently powerful and influential not just to  secure  all
      of that, until the civil war required  them  to  leave,  but  also  to
      facilitate the family's return to  Mogadishu  in  1996,  a  time  when
      generally, members of minority clans were at grave risk  in  Mogadishu
      generally and in particular when encountering majority  clan  militias
      at checkpoints. The appellant has explained that because this man "was
      waiting  for  us"  they  were  able  to  pass  through  the  Mogadishu
      checkpoints without difficulty.


  49. Next, having returned to Mogadishu in 1998  under  the  protection  of
      this man, as their house was occupied by other majority  can  members,
      they were invited to stay at the home of their  "patron"  for  several
      months. This is indicative of the level of support  available  and  no
      explanation has been offered as  to  why  this  man  would  decline  a
      request from the appellant for help on return, subject to what  I  say
      below about atheism and criminality.

  50. Also, in this regard, it is notable that the country evidence relating
      to that time indicated that the homes of minority  clan  members  were
      indeed simply taken by members of majority clans.  That  the  family's
      "patron" should not just assist by ejecting  the  occupants  from  the
      house but by paying, in 1996, $40,000 for the house rather than simply
      taking it for himself, indicates the security of the family's position
      under this patronage.

  51. The appellant's parents both chose to remain in  Mogadishu  after  the
      appellant and his brother decided to move to Europe. This was  despite
      the fact that their sons were able to make a  comfortable  journey  to
      their European destinations by each paying agents $5,000. The  parents
      retained the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the house and I do
      not accept that $30,000 would not have been sufficient to  fund  their
      own departure from Mogadishu should the conditions in which they  were
      living have been unsatisfactory.

  52. Similarly, we know that the appellant's mother died in  2013  and  had
      remained in the same accommodation that the family had occupied  since
      their house was sold in 1996. Nothing is  offered  to  show  that  the
      appellant's mother suffered any real difficulty  during  this  period.
      That demonstrates, as the appellant says that his mother was living in
      an IDP camp or in a refugee camp, that accommodation described as thus
      does not necessarily mean that its occupants suffer  Article  3  level
      harm.

  53. For these reasons,  I  am  entirely  satisfied  that  the  appellant's
      circumstances in Mogadishu before his  departure  were  not  difficult
      such as to require him to  leave  to  seek  international  protection.
      Rather, he and his brother left to seek  to  establish  themselves  in
      Europe to lead a different sort of life than did their parents.

  54. The appellant now has no family remaining in Mogadishu to look to  for
      assistance in re-establishing himself.  He is a member of  a  minority
      clan and it is submitted on the appellant's behalf,  based  upon  what
      was said in MOJ & Ors concerning the ability of  a  minority  clan  to
      provide assistance, that he will not be  able  to  look  to  his  clan
      either for support. On the other hand,  Mr  Jarvis  submits  that  the
      appellant's clan is such that the appellant would have resort to:

           "... a well established and pre-dominant Mogadishu community who
           have, in general, rebuilt their businesses in the  aftermath  of
           the initial period of the civil war."


      He points out that  in  April  2014  a  member  of  the  Benadari  was
      appointed  as  District  Commissioner  for  Hamar  Weyne  district  of
      Mogadishu.  He  submits  this  illustrates  that  the  Benadari   have
      established themselves as "significant players" both economically  and
      politically and points to country  evidence  that  there  has  been  a
      significant return to Mogadishu of Benadiri people after the departure
      from the city of Al Shabaab.  He  draws  attention  to  the  following
      extract from the 2012 Danish report:


           "A local NGO in  Mogadishu  stated  that  many  members  of  the
           Benadari community have returned to Hamar Weyne. Today there are
           many Benadari people living in Mogadishu and they are successful
           business people and some also are engaged  or  employed  in  the
           administration.... Today they are living well in  Mogadishu  and
           many  have  reopened  shops   or   undertaken   other   business
           activities..."

  55.  This evidence indicates that, even if some minority clans have little
      to offer to those of its members looking for assistance, the Benadari,
      of which the appellant's  clan  is  a  sub-clan,  is  not  in  such  a
      position. On the contrary, the economic enterprise  of  this  clan  is
      such that it has created  businesses  that  will  inevitably  generate
      employment opportunities and it is not easy to see why this would  not
      be to the appellant's advantage.

  56. As for access to financial resources, there is no evidence to  suggest
      that the appellant presently has access to any such. We simply do  not
      know if there remains available any part of the proceeds of  the  sale
      of the family home, as we  have  no  information  as  to  whether  the
      appellant's mother had expended that $30,000 in  maintaining  herself,
      even if it appears from what we have  been  told  that  her  outgoings
      would not have been great. But it would be speculative to assume  that
      the appellant would have access to any such funds upon return and so I
      proceed on the basis that he would not.

  57. He would, though, be entitled to claim  �750  under  the  respondent's
      Facilitated Return Scheme, should he chose to apply  for  it.  As  for
      remittances, it appears that the only possible  source  would  be  his
      brother in Birmingham but the appellant says that this brother has cut
      him off because of his atheism and that, in any  event,  that  brother
      has himself limited resources. The appellant  said  in  oral  evidence
      that he has continued to maintain contact with his  sister-in-law  who
      has begun to understand his position. It seems to me that  there  must
      be a real possibility, should the urgent need arise, that this brother
      would reconsider his position  and  act  as  do  most  of  the  Somali
      diaspora and provide what help  they  can  to  relatives  in  Somalia.
      However, once again, I accept that the  evidence  indicates  that  the
      appellant cannot, at least for the time being, rely upon  that  source
      of support.

  58. Before addressing the key  question  in  this  appeal,  which  is  the
      prospects of the appellant  securing  a  livelihood  in  Mogadishu  by
      finding work, it is necessary to look at what has occurred  while  the
      appellant has been in the United Kingdom. Mr Gilbert submits that  for
      much of the time the appellant has been in the United Kingdom  he  has
      been unemployed and homeless. Whilst it is true to say that there have
      been substantial periods during which the appellant has  been  without
      work or accommodation, that has been after his appeal rights have been
      exhausted and he had no lawful basis upon which to  be  in  employment
      and was not in receipt of other financial support. Conversely, when he
      has been entitled to work he has found employment. He has worked at  a
      BMW factory on Oxford for a seven month  period  and  in  a  car  tyre
      warehouse for  18  months.  In  addition,  while  serving  his  prison
      sentence the  appellant  has  made  good  use  of  his  time.  In  the
      appellant's bundle are copies of a number of certificates:

   a. City & Guilds Level 2 Diploma in Wall and Floor Tiling;
   b. City & Guilds Level  1  Award  in  Basic  Construction  Skills:  Paint
      finishing skills and surface preparation skills;
   c. City & Guilds Level 1 award in Basic Construction Skills;
   d. Cleaning Professionals Skills Suite certificate awarded by the British
      Institute of Cleaning Science (BICSc);
   e. Licence to Practice, issued by BICSc
   f. OCR Functional` Skills in Mathematics at Entry 3;
   g. OCR Functional Skills in English at Level 3
   h. OCR Level 1 "International Diploma for IT Users";
   i. OCR Level 1 Award in IT User Skills;
   j. NCFE Level 1 Award in Mentoring'


      In addition to which the appellant said in oral evidence that  he  had
      completed 8  weeks  of  a  16  week  bricklaying  course,  that  being
      interrupted by a diagnosis of diabetes so that while  being  diagnosed
      and treated for that condition, and learning how to control his  blood
      sugar levels, he had missed the end of that course.


  59. All of this indicates that the appellant would be  a  person  who,  in
      seeking low skilled work in Mogadishu would have advantages over those
      without anything to show a prospective  employer,  particularly  given
      his construction qualifications. The reasons offered  as  to  why  the
      appellant would have no prospect of securing work  on  return  do  not
      stand up to scrutiny.


  60. There is no evidence that the appellant would be at risk on account of
      his asserted atheism. Despite an invitation to do so, Mr  Gilbert  has
      been unable to  refer  me  to  any  evidence  of  compulsory  or  even
      encouraged attendance at mosque or even of disapproval of those who do
      not. Put shortly, it is hard to see why anyone would know, unless  the
      appellant volunteered that information, which there is no  reason  for
      him to do.

  61. Nor has it been established that there is any real risk of  difficulty
      being experienced by the appellant on account of  his  conviction,  in
      2010, for offences of sexual assault.  Leaving  aside  the  fact  that
      there is scant evidence  of  anyone  ever  having  been  subjected  to
      persecutory ill-treatment on return to Somalia on that account, it  is
      notable that the appellant faces deportation for an offence disclosing
      no such characteristics as might offend social mores.  It  is  notable
      also that there is no mention at all in the judge's sentencing remarks
      of the now 5 year old conviction for sexual assault  and  it  has  not
      been suggested that there were any press reports of  that  conviction.
      Therefore,  it  is  not  altogether  easy  to  see  how  or  why  that
      information would now become known upon return to Somalia.

  62. Ms Harper did cite one example of a man who  was  said  to  have  been
      killed on return after having  been  deported  on  account  of  having
      committed a sexual offence. She said that a colleague in Mogadishu had
      told her that a "convicted paedophile deported from the US"  had  been
      murdered soon after he arrived in Mogadishu. But, as Mr Jarvis pointed
      out, we  do  not  know  when  this  is  said  to  have  occurred,  the
      circumstances in which this happened, who was thought  responsible  or
      even the motive for the attack, although the context in  which  it  is
      cited invited the inference that this was to do with the nature of the
      offence committed. Also, there is no news or other report of  such  an
      incident.  For  all  these   reasons,   this   evidence   falls   very
      significantly short of establishing that which is asserted.

  63. As for the appellant's previous difficulties with  alcohol,  the  risk
      alleged now in that regard  is  simply  illusory.  The  appellant  has
      completed an Alcohol Awareness course and has confirmed, specifically,
      that he will not drink alcohol in future.  He  has  not  consumed  any
      alcohol for the last four years, while in prison, and that  period  of
      abstinence, reinforced by his  completion  of  the  Alcohol  Awareness
      course and stated resolve to abstain in future,  taken  together  with
      the fact that in Somalia use of alcohol is illegal and it is not  easy
      to obtain, means that there is no real risk that this will  become  an
      issue in the future.

  64. Drawing all of this together, I reach the following  conclusions.  The
      appellant does not face  a  real  risk  of  being  subjected  to  ill-
      treatment sufficiently serious to infringe Article 3 of  the  ECHR  on
      account of any of the reasons asserted. In particular:

   a. There is no reason to  suppose  that  the  appellant's  atheism  would
      become known and, in any event, the evidence does  not  establish  any
      real risk of persons in Mogadishu being subjected to ill-treatment  on
      that account;


   b. While it may become known that  the  appellant  has  been  removed  to
      Mogadishu on account of a deportation order following conviction for a
      serous criminal offence, the evidence does not establish any real risk
      to returnees on such account.  There  is  no  reason  why  an  earlier
      conviction for sexual assault would become known and the appellant has
      identified no reason to suppose anyone who would  be  able  to  do  so
      would now wish to make that known and,  in  any  event,  the  evidence
      simply does not establish that  persons  convicted  of  offences  that
      might be thought to offend social mores do in fact face a real risk of
      Article 3 ill-treatment, even if that matter may have been  left  open
      by the Tribunal in MOJ and Ors;

   c. There is no reason to suppose  that  the  appellant  would  resort  to
      alcohol upon return. In any event, the evidence does not  support  the
      asserted risk of ill-treatment to those  in  Somalia  who  do  consume
      alcohol, even to excess;

   d. The asserted fear of a revenge attack by family members of the  victim
      of the assault  carried  out  by  this  appellant  for  which  he  was
      sentenced to 6 years imprisonment is entirely speculative. I have been
      referred to no evidence of such revenge attacks in fact being  carried
      out in the past in Mogadishu. There is no evidence of any threats have
      been made to or received by the appellant.

   e. The appellant is equipped with skills  and  qualifications  that  will
      assist him in seeking work upon return to Mogadishu,  particularly  in
      the construction industry. As was made plain in MOJ &  Ors,  while  it
      may assist a person seeing to find work to have the sponsorship of  an
      established family network of majority clan, absence of  that  support
      was not a disqualification to  access  to  work.  This  appellant  has
      relevant skills and work experience in the United Kingdom and  he  has
      not shown that he has no prospect of securing a  livelihood.  Further,
      as I have said above, there is evidence of a vibrant Benadiri business
      community to which the appellant can also look in  his  search  for  a
      livelihood.

   f. The appellant has no family accommodation in Mogadishu  to  return  to
      but, as is evidenced by the experience of his own parents,  resort  to
      less  formal  accommodation  does  not  necessarily  mean  living   in
      conditions that fall below the Article 3 threshold. This appellant can
      apply for a resettlement grant and is well placed to  secure  work  in
      the vibrant construction industry in Mogadishu today.

                 DECISION AND REASONS FOR SETTING ASIDE THE
                  DETERMINATION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Somalia  born  on  1  January  1974.   He
    entered the United Kingdom on 11  November  1998  and  claimed  asylum.
    That application was refused and an appeal  against  such  refusal  was
    subsequently dismissed.  Thereafter the appellant made a further asylum
    claim in April 2006, giving a false name and date of  birth,  but  that
    application was subsequently refused on non-compliance grounds.

 2. The appellant has a lengthy history of criminal offending in the United
    Kingdom.  He was convicted  of  common  assault  in  2002,  two  sexual
    assaults and common assault in 2010, a breach of a community  order  in
    2010 and for both failure to surrender and destroying/damaging property
    in 2011.

 3. Most significantly, however, the appellant was convicted on 27  October
    2011 of wounding with intent, and sentenced to a  term  of  six  years'
    imprisonment.  This led the Secretary of State to make  a  decision  to
    deport him pursuant to section 5(1) of the Immigration  Act  1971.  The
    First-tier Tribunal identifies such decision as having been made  on  5
    June 2014 - although on its face it is undated.  On this  same  date  a
    deportation order was signed in the appellant's name.

 4. The appellant brought an appeal to the First-tier Tribunal. That appeal
    was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Chohan and  Ms  V  S  Street  JP
    ("the Panel") on 11 March 2015  and  dismissed  on  all  grounds  in  a
    determination promulgated on 29 April 2015.

 5. In its determination the Panel concluded  that  section  72(2)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 applied to this  appellant
    and thus he was not  entitled  to  deploy  Refugee  Convention  grounds
    therein.  The First-tier Tribunal also dismissed the appellant's appeal
    brought on Article 3 and Article 8 ECHR grounds.

 6. The appellant appeals to the Upper  Tribunal  with  the  permission  of
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pooler,  dated  27  May  2015.  He  brings
    challenge only to the Panel's decision made in relation to Article 3.

Submissions

 7. The grounds on which such a challenge is brought can be  summarised  as
    follows:  The Panel erred in either failing to take  into  account,  or
    failing to provide adequate or any reasons for rejecting, the relevance
    of: (i) the fact that the appellant is an atheist; (ii) the appellant's
    history of alcoholism; (iii) the nature  of  the  appellant's  criminal
    offending and in particular his conviction  for  sexual  assault;  and,
    (iv) the length of the appellant's absence from the United Kingdom.

 8. It is also submitted that the Panel failed to engage fully or  properly
    with the evidence provided in relation to the prospect of the appellant
    obtaining employment in Mogadishu.

 9. In response Mr Avery submitted that the Panel's determination is  clear
    and adequate and that all of the matters identified  above  were  fully
    taken  into  account.  He  asserted,  in  the  alternative,  that   the
    evidential foundation said to provide support for the relevance of  the
    aforementioned matters was so inadequate that any failure by the  Panel
    to engage with them cannot have been material to its determination.





Discussion and Decision

10. Having carefully considered the  Panel's  determination,  the  evidence
    provided by the appellant, the evidence of the expert, Ms Harper -  who
    provided evidence in the form of a report on the appellant's  behalf  -
    and the parties' submissions, I conclude for the reasons  which  follow
    that the Panel's determination does contain an error of law capable  of
    affecting the outcome of the appeal such that it ought to be set aside.



11. It is prudent for me first to  set  out  the  core  paragraphs  of  the
    Panel's determination upon which both parties sought to rely:

         "38.     We  cannot  conclude  definitively  that  upon  return  to
             Mogadishu the appellant would have support from his own  clan.
             According to the appellant's account he has no family  members
             in  Mogadishu.   However,  the  appellant  is  a   resourceful
             individual.  He came to the United  Kingdom  when  he  was  24
             years of age.  The United Kingdom, at that time, was an  alien
             country to him and he has managed to survive here without  the
             support  of  clan  and  family  members.   We  note  that  the
             appellant has a brother in the United Kingdom but according to
             his account he is not on talking terms.  We further note  that
             the appellant has obtained certificates in alcohol  awareness;
             mathematics; basic construction skills; cleaning professionals
             skills suite; awarded mentoring; a diploma in wall  and  floor
             tiling; an awarded functional skills qualification in English;
             and certificates in information technology.

         39.      The appellant originates from Mogadishu and  therefore  it
             is not a city that he is  unfamiliar  with.   Upon  return  to
             Mogadishu he could put to use the skills and  certificates  he
             has obtained in the United Kingdom.  We note that  the  expert
             report concludes that the appellant may well be at  risk  upon
             return due to his atheism, criminal convictions and length  of
             stay in the United Kingdom.  However, those conclusions do not
             fit in with the country guidance case of MOJ  &  Others.   The
             situation in Mogadishu has  significantly  changed,  certainly
             with the absence of Al Shabab.  There is  nothing  to  suggest
             that the appellant's past, upon return, would be disclosed  to
             the authorities or any other organisation in  Somalia.   There
             is no real explanation, in view of the appellant's  subjective
             fear, why, on at least two occasions he  made  an  application
             for voluntary return to Somalia.  In light of the case of  MOJ
             & Others, we find that the appellant faces  no  real  risk  of
             serious harm or ill-treatment contrary to  Article  3  of  the
             ECHR."

12. Taking in turn the matters that Mr Gilbert  submits  the  Panel  either
    failed to take into account or failed to provide adequate  reasons  for
    rejecting the relevance  of,  I  start  with  the  appellant's  claimed
    atheism.

13. The appellant gave clear evidence  in  his  witness  statement  to  the
    effect that he is an atheist.  He also asserts that  his  atheism  will
    become apparent upon return to Somalia because, for  example,  he  will
    not be attending the mosque as others do.

14. Ms Harper produced 'expert evidence' on the appellant's behalf  to  the
    Panel. In relation to the appellant's atheism she stated as follows:

         "I believe that Al Shabaab would  try  to  execute  or  assassinate
         [AAW] if it discovered he was an atheist.  [AAW] would face immense
         prejudice and possible violence if other people in  Mogadishu  knew
         of  his  beliefs.   Somalia  has  become  increasingly  religiously
         conservative since the collapse of effective central government  in
         1991, partly as a result of years of funding from Saudi Arabia  for
         madrasas and mosques at a time when  the  rest  of  the  world  had
         largely abandoned the country to its own devices."

15. Whilst I accept Mr Avery's submission that Ms Harper's evidence was  in
    large part not accepted in the country guidance decision in MOJ, it was
    not rejected in its entirety.

16.  The  Panel  in  the  case  rejected  Ms  Harper's  evidence   on   the
    aforementioned issue on the basis that "those conclusions do not fit in
    with the country guidance case of MOJ".

17. This though is not correct.  Nowhere in its decision in  MOJ  does  the
    Upper Tribunal consider the potential risk to those who are atheists or
    even to those who are not of the Muslim  religion.   Whilst  there  are
    passages within MOJ which indicate that  Al  Shabaab  does  not  target
    anyone in Mogadishu and, consequently, it  can  be  inferred  therefrom
    that they would not target someone for being an atheist  as  Ms  Harper
    opines, the following is stated in paragraph 399 of its determination:

         "Absent some aspect of a person's profile making him of  particular
         adverse interest to Al Shabaab or to the authorities as a  possible
         supporter of Al Shabaab there is not a general risk for a  civilian
         simply by being present in the city, of serious harm as a result of
         indiscriminate violence."

18. This conclusory paragraph leaves open the possibility that there may be
    a risk from Al Shabaab if a person's profile makes them  of  particular
    adverse interest to  that  organisation.  Ms  Harper  evidence  is  not
    inconsistent with this. Given what is said in paragraph 399  of  MOJ  I
    conclude that it was not lawful for the Panel to dispose on  this  limb
    of the appellant's case on the basis that it did.

19. Moving on to the relevance of the appellant's previous  offending.   At
    paragraph 479 of its decision the Tribunal in MOJ said:

         "Mr Toal submitted that SSM [one of the appellants  in  MOJ]  would
         face further difficulties precisely because he is being deported on
         account of having committed  criminal  offences  in  this  country.
         There was not a clear consensus in the expert evidence  about  this
         matter but we  are  satisfied  that,  absent  some  aspect  of  the
         offending disclosing characteristics such as to offend core Somalis
         mores (which is  not  the  case  here),  simple  criminality  on  a
         returnee's part, even if it somehow came to be known  about,  would
         not cause anyone to act any differently towards him."

20. Ms Harper opined in the instant  case  that  the  appellant's  criminal
    history would lead him to be at increased risk, ostracised  and  looked
    down upon in  Mogadishu  (which  would  also  have  an  impact  on  his
    employability there) if such history, and in particular the convictions
    for committing sexual offences, were to become known.  As to  how  this
    history would become known in Mogadishu Ms Harper provided evidence  of
    significant communication lines between  the  Diaspora  in  the  United
    Kingdom and persons in Mogadishu and opined that the appellant would be
    "unlikely" to be able to hide his history of criminality if her were to
    be returned.

21. On this issue  it  can  be  seen  from  paragraph  39  of  the  Panel's
    determination  that  it  rejected  the  relevance  of  the  appellant's
    criminality on the basis that (i) it "does not fit" with the  reasoning
    in the country guidance case of MOJ and (ii) because there was  nothing
    to suggest  that  the  appellant's  past  would  be  disclosed  to  the
    authorities, or any other organisation, in Somalia.

22. As to the former, once again it  is  clearly  not  the  case  that  the
    evidence of Ms Harper, and the contentions made by the  appellant,  are
    inconsistent with the decision in MOJ - and in particular paragraph 479
    thereof.  As to the latter issue, the First-tier  Tribunal  provide  no
    reasons for rejecting Ms Harper's evidence and opinion  given  in  this
    regard.

23. In addition to the clear errors in the Panel's determination previously
    identified, there is yet a further difficulty therein relating  to  the
    how the Panel treated the appellant's resourcefulness  and  ability  to
    "survive" in the  UK.  As  set  out  above,  in  paragraph  38  of  its
    determination the Panel observed that the  appellant  had  "managed  to
    survive here without the support  of  clan  and  family  members"  and,
    thereafter, it took this to be a relevant factor in  its  consideration
    of the ability of the appellant to survive and/or integrate upon return
    to Mogadishu.

24. I agree with Mr Gilbert that in doing so the Panel both failed to  take
    into account a material matter, and failed to consider the level of the
    appellant's resourcefulness in  its  proper  and  full  context  -  the
    appellant having been an alcoholic and homeless in the UK from 2003  to
    at least 2006, and possibility  later.   This  is  clearly  a  relevant
    factor in any consideration of the  circumstances  that  the  appellant
    might find himself in if returned to Mogadishu.

25. For all of the above reasons I set aside the decision of the First-tier
    Tribunal.  The re-making of the decision on appeal is to be  undertaken
    by the Upper Tribunal and is limited to Article 3 ECHR grounds

26. Mr Gilbert submitted that  should  the  Panel's  determination  be  set
    aside, then the re-making of the decision should  be  adjourned  to  be
    heard at a later date. That submission is difficult  in  light  of  the
    directions that were sent  to  the  parties  and,  in  particular,  the
    indication therein  that  the  initial  hearing  would  be  limited  to
    determining whether there  was  an  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's determination, absent there being a need  for  further  oral
    evidence to be given. However, although no additional witness statement
    has been provided in this regard, it is  envisaged  that  such  further
    evidence will be given by the appellant.

27. It would also be of great assistance to the Upper Tribunal  if  further
    country background evidence, including more detailed evidence  from  Ms
    Harper or another  'expert',  could  be  provided  by  the  parties  in
    relation to the relevance of  (i)  the  appellant's  atheism  (ii)  his
    particular criminal history and (iii) his alcoholism, to the assessment
    of the circumstances that he will face upon his return to Mogadishu.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal's determination is set aside. The  remaking  of  the
decision will be undertaken by the Upper Tribunal and will be limited  to  a
consideration of whether the appellant's removal will lead to  a  breach  of
Article 3 ECHR.


                                 Directions

    1. Any further evidence to be relied upon by the parties is to be  filed
       with the Upper Tribunal (in duplicate) and  served  on  the  opposing
       party no later than 21 days before the date of the resumed hearing


    2. The parties are to file with the Upper Tribunal  (in  duplicate)  and
       serve on the opposing party written submissions of  no  more  than  5
       sides of A4 no later than 7 days prior to the  date  of  the  resumed
       hearing.

concerning a bomb attack by Al Shabaab carried out in Mogadishu on a hotel
said to be popular with Somalia's members of Parliament, it was said that:

    "A website associated with al-Shabab said it was responsible for the
    attack, which it was said was carried out early in the morning to avoid
    civilian casualties. This is a clear change in strategy, says BBC World
    Service Africa editor Mary Harper...": http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-

Despite that, in a subsequent news report by Mary Harper herself, dated 7
November 2015, not only did she make no mention of this statement of intent
by Al- Shabaab to avoid civilian casualties, but said instead:

    "Like many other insurgent groups, al-Shabab often conducts double
    suicide attacks, waiting for the emergency services and onlookers to
    gather at the scene before sending in another vehicle to ensure maximum
    casualties.": http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-34745495
