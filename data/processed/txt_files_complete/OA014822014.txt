Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Ince made following a hearing at Bradford on 8th September  2014.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan.  She applied to come to the  UK
    as a spouse but was refused entry clearance on  the  grounds  that  the
    Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that she was in a genuine and
    subsisting  relationship  or  that  she  could   meet   the   financial
    requirements of the Rules.

 3. By the time the matter came before the Judge the  only  issue  was  the
    financial one.  The Judge found that the Sponsor was working as claimed
    and that he had two sources of income.  He was a counter  assistant  at
    BBQ Hut and a production operative at Stafforce Personnel Limited.  His
    combined income from both these sources was about �21,379 per year.  He
    produced P60s  for  both  jobs  confirming  the  employment.   He  also
    produced wage slips from both employers and  bank  statements  for  the
    period from November 2012  to  July  2013  plus  an  employment  record
    schedule and a schedule of monthly earnings.

 4. So far as the employment from BBQ Hut was concerned he was paid in cash
    which he used for day-to-day expenditure and support  for  himself  and
    his wife.

 5. The Judge said that the Sponsor was unable to comply  with  the  strict
    requirements of the Rules but that they were

         "unreasonable that they  are  so  prescriptive  as  to  expect  and
         require a spouse to live his life in a certain way by always paying
         his cash earnings into his account.  It makes  sense  that  if  his
         other earnings are paid direct into his account for him to keep his
         cash earnings as spending money for  his  day-to-day  requirements.
         Accordingly as the Sponsor  was  paid  in  cash  for  his  BBQ  Hut
         earnings it was virtually impossible for him to satisfy the  Rules.
         I reiterate that I consider it unreasonable for him to be  required
         to alter his perfectly reasonable way  of  living  when  there  are
         other  ways  of  him  demonstrating  that  he  met   the   earnings
         requirements."

 6. On that basis he allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 7. The Secretary of State appealed and  permission  was  granted  on  17th
    December 2014.

Findings and Conclusions

 8. Paragraph  2  of  Appendix  FM  provides  that  in  terms  of  salaried
    employment in the UK all of the following evidence must be provided:

         "(a) wage slips covering

             (i)  a period of six months prior to the date of application;

         (c)  personal bank statements corresponding to the same  period  as
             the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that  the  salary  has
             been paid into an account in the name of the person  or  their
             partner jointly."

 9. When a Sponsor is paid in cash for the gross amount to  be  taken  into
    account all of the monies received from the  employment  must  be  paid
    directly into the bank.  This is a mandatory requirement.   It  is  not
    for  the  Judge  to  decide  whether  the  Rules  are   reasonable   or
    unreasonable.  His task was to decide whether the decision of the Entry
    Clearance Officer was in accordance with the law  and  the  Immigration
    Rules.

10. The Sponsor was not in a position  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    specified evidence provisions of the Rules and therefore, even  if  the
    Judge was satisfied that he did meet the maintenance level  of  �18,600
    he was not entitled to allow the appeal.

11. The argument raised by Mr Hussain before the Judge in  relation  to  JL
    (Domestic violence evidence and procedure) India [2006] UKAIT  58,  but
    sensibly not pursued at this hearing, had no  relevance  in  this  case
    where the Rules make provision for specified evidence in Appendix FM.

12. The proper course  is  a  reapplication  where  all  of  the  specified
    evidence should be provided.

Decision

13. The original judge erred in law.   His  decision  is  set  aside.   The
    Secretary of State's appeal is allowed and the  following  decision  is
    substituted.  The Claimant's appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
