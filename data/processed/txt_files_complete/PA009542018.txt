                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Ms N Loughran, of Loughran & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This determination is to be read with:

      i) The respondent's decision  dated  29  January  2018,  refusing  the
         appellant's claim.

     ii) The appellant's grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

    iii) The decision of FtT Judge I Ross, promulgated on 22 March 2018.

     iv) The appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT,  stated  in  the
         application for permission to appeal made to the FtT, dated 6 April
         2018, at section C.

      v) The FtT's refusal of permission, dated 24 April 2018.

     vi) The appellant's grounds of appeal as stated in the application  for
         permission to appeal filed with the UT on 25 May 2018.

    vii) The grant of permission by the UT, dated 27 June 2018.

 2. Mrs O'Brien conceded that the judge had misapprehended the evidence  on
    an important aspect of the case, and that it could not be said that the
    resulting negative findings had no impact on  the  rest  of  the  FtT's
    reasoning.

 3. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.

 4. The nature of the case is such that it is appropriate under section  12
    of the 2007 Act, and under Practice Statement 7.2, to remit to the  FtT
    for an entirely fresh hearing.

 5. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Ross.

 6. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
