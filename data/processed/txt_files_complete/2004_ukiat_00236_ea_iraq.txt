                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

For the Appellant/Secretary of State:   Mr M. Davidson, Home Office
                                  Presenting Officer
For the Respondent/Claimant:      Mr E. Nicholson, Counsel, instructed by
                                  Wilson & Co., Solicitors,


  1. The Secretary  of  State  appeals  against  the  determination  of  an
     Adjudicator, Mr C. G. Blake, promulgated on 27 October  2003  allowing
     the Claimant's appeal under Article 8 of the  ECHR.   The  Adjudicator
     dismissed the Claimant's appeal on asylum and Article 3 grounds.

  2. The Claimant is a citizen of Iraq, born on 9 February 1969, who is now
     35 years old.  She entered the United Kingdom  on  21  June  1997  and
     claimed asylum three days later on 24 June  1997.   The  Secretary  of
     State refused her asylum claim by a decision dated 22  February  2001.
     The Claimant's immigration history is not clear from the papers before
     us but it appears she must have been  given  some  sort  of  leave  to
     remain because the decision of the Secretary of State gave rise  to  a
     right of appeal under section 69(3) of the Immigration and Asylum  Act
     1999.  The Claimant appealed and the Adjudicator subsequently  decided
     that there were  special  circumstances  permitting  the  Claimant  to
     appeal out of time.

  3. The Claimant was born and brought up in Karbala.  Having completed her
     education, she trained as a teacher but refused  to  join  the  Ba'ath
     Party.  She suffered at the hands of the authorities until her  father
     decided that she should leave Iraq.  She left the country in  February
     1997 and travelled to Jordan.  By the time she arrived in  the  United
     Kingdom she was an ill woman and in need of medical treatment that was
     not available to her in Jordan.

  4. Whilst in the United Kingdom  she  met  .................   The  civil
     ceremony of marriage took place on 31 October 2000.   Her  husband  is
     also from Iran and had come to the United Kingdom  in  1992  or  1993.
     The Claimant applied for leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  as  a
     spouse by an application lodged on 17 June  2002.   The  Secretary  of
     State has made no decision on that application.  This may have been  a
     conscious decision, enabling the  Secretary  of  State  to  await  the
     outcome of the Claimant's asylum/human rights appeal.

  5. The Adjudicator was relieved of the obligation of reaching a  decision
     under the Refugee Convention or under Article 3 as  a  result  of  the
     fall of the regime of  Sadaam  Hussein.   The  Adjudicator  concluded,
     quite properly, that there was no basis upon which either claim  could
     succeed in October 2003.  There is no appeal against that finding.

  6. The Adjudicator then went on to  consider  the  Claimant's  Article  8
     claim based upon her marriage to Mr ..............  The  Adjudicator's
     determination is permeated by his  frustration  at  the  Secretary  of
     State's conduct and of his handling of the application, culminating in
     the fact that he chose not be represented at the  hearing  before  the
     Adjudicator.  See paragraphs 2, 6, 31 and 33 of the  determination  by
     way of example.  Indeed, in paragraph 35  of  the  determination,  the
     Adjudicator  concluded  his  determination  by  calling  to  mind  the
     catalogue of failure, as the Adjudicator saw it to be, on the part  of
     the Secretary of State.

  7. There is no dispute that the Claimant and  her  husband  enjoy  family
     life together and are attached to each other.  Mr ........ is  settled
     in  the  United  Kingdom,  thereby  providing  the  Claimant  with  an
     opportunity to apply for settlement as his spouse.  The appeal has not
     been argued on the basis that Mr and Mrs ......... should be  required
     to re-locate permanently in Iraq.  Rather, the position adopted by the
     Secretary of State is that the Claimant should make an application for
     entry clearance under the Immigration  Rules.  The  Adjudicator  found
     that, were the Claimant to be removed to Iraq in order to make a claim
     for settlement, the removal would be an interference with her existing
     family  life.   Such  a  finding,  of  course,  presupposed  that  the
     Claimant's spouse would not accompany her during her  absence  abroad.
     It was not suggested that her husband could not do so.  The grounds of
     appeal by the Secretary of State  to  not,  however,  raise  a  direct
     challenge  to  the  Adjudicator's  finding  that  there  would  be  an
     interference with existing family life and we do not  propose  to  re-
     open that element of the appeal.

  8.  The challenge made by the Secretary of State in the grounds of appeal
     is  a   direct   challenge   to   the   Adjudicator's   treatment   of
     proportionality.    The   Adjudicator   found   that   it   would   be
     disproportionate for the Claimant to be required to leave  the  United
     Kingdom in order to make an application for entry clearance under  the
     Immigration Rules.  His reasoning is found  in  paragraph  33  of  the
     determination:

           "The law about the application of Article 8 in removal cases  is
           contained in a number of recent decisions, the most important of
           which is that of the Court of Appeal in Mahmood.  The court then
           made it clear that it would only be in exceptional circumstances
           that the right to respect for family life under Article 8  would
           not give way to the accepted and legitimate aim  of  immigration
           control which has been recognised,  albeit  not  explicitly,  as
           falling within the qualification in Article 8  (2).   The  Court
           did not define what it meant by  exceptional  circumstances  but
           indicated there would have to be insurmountable obstacles to the
           non-resident or non-citizen spouse returning abroad to  make  an
           application for return under the Immigration Rules.  I  have  no
           doubt that there are such obstacles in this  unusual  case.   In
           the first place, British diplomatic representation  in  Iraq  is
           severely restricted at present and I doubt that an active  entry
           clearance service is provided.  It is true  that  the  appellant
           could go to another country such as Syria or Jordan  where  such
           services do exist but her state of health is such that it  would
           not be reasonable to expect her to do so.  It is  possible  that
           her husband might be able to  accompany  her  were  she  the  go
           abroad, but in the circumstances of this case, it  seems  to  me
           that that  would  be  a  futile  and  pointless  exercise.   The
           respondent has known about this application for  over  one  year
           yet has failed entirely to respond to the appellant's solicitors
           when  they  repeatedly  asked  for  information.   This   is   a
           dereliction of his public responsibilities even if he  had  been
           minded to refuse the application.  I accept that he is not bound
           to deal with such an application whilst an asylum claim  remains
           outstanding but it would have been both sensible and  humane  to
           have  done  so.   To  persistently  ignore  the   letters   from
           solicitors is not good public administration.  I was told by  Mr
           Jackson that one letter sent  to  the  Deputy  Director  of  the
           Immigration and Nationality Department had produced the response
           that the matter had been passed to a case working section to  be
           dealt with.  This letter was sent many months  ago  yet  nothing
           further had been done about the  case.   It  seems  to  me  self
           evident that the respondent had taken  a  specific  decision  to
           refuse to address the application until  the  asylum  claim  had
           been concluded.  At the very least, the respondent  should  have
           indicated what his position was about the claim, when  it  would
           be addressed and would also have assisted me to  know  what  his
           attitude was to the claim in the context of the  asylum  appeal.
           I was not provided with any such assistance."


  9. The Secretary of State has appealed against the Adjudicator's decision
     that the Claimant's removal would be a  violation  of  her  Article  8
     rights.  The grounds of appeal challenge the Adjudicator's  conclusion
     that the Claimant's spouse should not be  expected  to  accompany  her
     whilst he makes her application for entry  clearance.   Secondly,  the
     grounds of appeal challenge the Adjudicator's  conclusion  that  there
     are no facilities to seek Entry Clearance in Iraq.   This  ground  was
     not pursued before us.  Indeed, we understand that it is now  accepted
     there are no such facilities in Iraq.  The  grounds,  however,  assert
     that the Adjudicator was in error in concluding  that  the  Claimant's
     health prevented her seeking entry clearance in Syria or  Jordan.   We
     have heard no argument on whether there are any facilities  in  Syria.
     This is unnecessary because the Secretary of State has designated  the
     Embassy in Jordan as the foreign post at which applications for  entry
     clearance by Iraqi nationals can be made.

 10.  The  issue  of  the  Claimant's  health  was  canvassed  before   the
     Adjudicator.  In paragraph 24 of  the  determination  the  Adjudicator
     recorded the report from the Claimant's GP in which he classified  the
     Claimant's main problems as incontinence  and  infertility.   She  was
     receiving treatment for both.  The incontinence had arisen following a
     fall whilst the Claimant was still in Iraq.

 11. Mr Davidson, who appeared on behalf of the Secretary of State,  relied
     upon DM(HDZ) Croatia*CG [2004] UKIAT 000 24 (Ouseley J., President) in
     which the Tribunal said in paragraph 28:

           "The starting point should be that if in the  circumstances  the
           removal could reasonably be regarded as  proportionate,  whether
           or not the Secretary of State has actually said  so  or  applied
           his  mind  to  the  issue,  it  is  lawful.   The  Tribunal  and
           Adjudicators should regard Shala, Edore and  Djali as  providing
           clear exemplification of  the  limits  of  what  is  lawful  and
           proportionate.  They should normally hold that the  decision  to
           remove is unlawful only when the disproportion is so great  that
           no  reasonable  Secretary  of  State  could  remove   in   those
           circumstances.  However,  where  the  Secretary  of  State  e.g.
           through  a  consistent  decision-making   pattern   or   through
           decisions in relation to members of the same family, has clearly
           shown where within the range of  reasonable  responses  his  own
           assessment would  lie,  it  would  be  inappropriate  to  assess
           proportionality by  reference  to  a  wider  range  of  possible
           responses than he in fact uses.  It would otherwise have to be a
           truly exceptional case, identified  and  reasoned,  which  would
           justify the conclusion that the removal decision was unlawful by
           reference to an assessment that removal was within the range  of
           reasonable assessments of proportionality.  We cannot  think  of
           one at present; it is simply that we cannot rule it  out.   This
           decision is starred for what we say about proportionality."

 12. We are satisfied that the Adjudicator was correct in  identifying  the
     need to  find  exceptional  circumstances  sufficient  to  render  the
     removal decision unlawful or the existence of insurmountable obstacles
     preventing an out-of-country application.  The Adjudicator found  that
     these circumstances or obstacles existed by reason of a combination of
     the absence of diplomatic representation in Iraq  and  the  Claimant's
     state of health. It is those  findings  that  are  challenged  by  the
     Secretary of State.  The existence of a viable  option  of  making  an
     application for entry clearance was considered by the Tribunal  in  HC
     (Availability of Entry Clearance Facilities) Iraq [2004] UKIAT  00154,
     (Mr  A.  Jordan,  Chairman).   The  Tribunal  first   considered   the
     relationship between the use of the Immigration Rules  and  issues  of
     proportionality:

           10.  In Baljit Singh [2002] UKIAT 00660, the  appellant  applied
           for leave to remain as the fianc� of a British citizen.  It  was
           accepted that he and his fianc�e shared a family  life  together
           with her two children of a previous marriage.  His  partner  was
           partially immobile as a result of an industrial accident and one
           of the children was in the middle  of  GCSE  examinations.   The
           Tribunal  commented  on  the  adjudicator's  concentration  upon
           whether there were insurmountable obstacles in the  way  of  the
           family following the appellant to India.  The Tribunal  did  not
           criticise the legitimacy of such an approach but focussed on the
           consideration of the viable option of making  an  out-of-country
           application for entry clearance as a spouse.   Consideration  to
           this option was all  the  more  important  given  the  fianc�e's
           refusal to leave the United Kingdom.  Such an option was a  more
           immediate and sufficient reason for concluding that the decision
           to  remove  was  proportionate  as  it  did  not  represent  any
           conclusive disruption  of  the  appellant's  family  life.   The
           appellant was not faced with any  permanent  or  even  long-term
           exclusion from continuing family life  in  the  United  Kingdom.
           The option afforded the appellant a right of  appeal  against  a
           refusal and both the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer  or
           Immigration Officer and any subsequent appeal had  the  in-built
           right to require  that  any  decision  was  compliant  with  the
           appellant's human rights.  Thus, the existence of a legal avenue
           abroad is sufficient to render the removal proportionate and  it
           will only be in exceptional circumstances that the decision will
           not be so.  This accords with  the  decision  in  the  Court  of
           Appeal in Mahmood  [2001]  Imm  AR  229  that  there  should  be
           equality of treatment between those who have entered the  United
           Kingdom and those who apply from abroad or, as Laws LJ  said  at
           paragraph 23 of the judgment: "...it would be manifestly  unfair
           to other would-be entrants who are content to take  their  place
           in the entry clearance queue in their country of origin."


            11.  Exceptional circumstances were not said to exist where the
           effect of separation was likely to require the remaining  spouse
           to become dependant on public funds for subsistence, even  in  a
           case where the remaining spouse was  partially  disabled.   (See
           Baljit Singh itself.)  Nor where the separation will  result  in
           the appellant losing his job (as  would  normally  occur),  even
           where there was no guarantee that the  same  or  a  similar  job
           would  be  available  on  return.   (See  Mahmood.)   The  Entry
           Clearance  Officer  can  be  expected  to  have  regard  to  the
           appellant's work-record as evidence of the appellant's  and  his
           partner's ability to maintain and accommodate themselves without
           recourse to public funds.  It is not an exceptional circumstance
           that the appellant runs the risk of failing  in  an  application
           for entry  clearance.   Indeed,  it  is  plainly  arguable  that
           Article 8 should not be used as a  means  of  circumventing  the
           provisions of the Immigration Rules.


           12.  Exceptional circumstances  may  be  established  where  the
           returning appellant is unable to make an  effective  application
           for entry clearance from abroad  either  because  there  are  no
           facilities for making such an  application  in  his  country  of
           nationality or by travelling to a neighbouring country,  (Soloot
           (01/TH/1366) or if there is  a  prolonged  delay  rendering  the
           period of separation disproportionate, (Mahmood).

 13. The Tribunal concluded:

           26.  For these reasons, we  consider  that  there  is  a  viable
           option available to the claimant to return to Iraq and apply for
           entry clearance as a spouse.  Although this will involve  travel
           to Jordan, we do not consider that the difficulties are such  as
           to   render   the   decision   of   the   Secretary   of   State
           disproportionate.

 14. The Adjudicator anticipated that the  Claimant  could  go  to  another
     country such as Jordan where United Kingdom diplomatic  representation
     exists capable of dealing with an  application  for  entry  clearance.
     He  did  not  have  sight  of  the  Tribunal's  determination  in   HC
     (Availability of Entry Clearance Facilities) Iraq [2004]  UKIAT  00154
     but rejected the option as inappropriate because of the Claimant's ill-
     health.  Yet the evidence before the Adjudicator as to the  Claimant's
     health was limited to the Claimant's GP's report that she had problems
     with incontinence and infertility and that she was receiving treatment
     for both.  In our judgment, these  difficulties  do  not  prevent  her
     travelling either to Iraq or Jordan.   Mr Davidson  pointed  out  that
     her medical condition (so the Adjudicator found) was not  sufficiently
     serious to engage an Article 3 violation were  she  to  return.   That
     being the case, it was said to be illogical  to  find  that  the  same
     medical condition rendered her return unlawful under Article 8 and the
     balancing exercise required  to  determine  whether  the  removal  was
     proportionate.  On this aspect, we do not  agree  with  Mr  Davidson's
     submission.  When considering proportionality, the level of ill health
     does not need to reach Article 3 severity before it can be taken  into
     account.  Irrespective of this and for the reasons that we have given,
     we consider that the  Adjudicator's  determination  on  Article  8  is
     flawed.

 15. There is, however, another reason  why  it  is  inappropriate  to  use
     Article 8 as a substitute for an application for entry clearance.   In
     cases where there is a viable option of applying under the Immigration
     Rules, it is likely to  be  extremely  rare  that  the  Claimant  will
     succeed under the European Convention on Human Rights,  though  likely
     to fail under the Rules.  Where leave to enter or  remain  is  sought,
     the primary decision-maker is either the Secretary  of  State  or  the
     Entry Clearance Officer. It is open to the Entry Clearance Officer  to
     interview the applicant  and  require  that  he  provides  documentary
     evidence  in  support  of  his  application.   In  cases   where   the
     application is made out-of-country, the Entry Clearance  Officer  will
     often have valuable local  knowledge  that  an  Adjudicator  will  not
     possess.   In many cases, the assessment of the facts will often  best
     be made by the primary decision maker.  We do not consider that, where
     there is a viable application under the Rules, whether in- or  out-of-
     country, the Adjudicator should seek to second-guess the  decision  in
     an entry clearance case under the umbrella of an Article 8 claim.   It
     has to be remembered that  if  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  or  the
     Secretary of State is in error, the applicant has an in-built right of
     appeal as well as a right to require that any decision  made  complies
     with his human rights.

 16. In our judgment, the present appeal may  be  a  case  in  point.   The
     Claimant's application is based upon her marriage  to  ...............
     In her original application for entry  clearance,  however,  found  at
     section B of our papers, the Claimant described herself in 1997  as  a
     married woman.  See box 15.  Indeed, although she originally described
     herself as single, the tick provided in the appropriate box  has  been
     etched over and the  box  marked  "married",  ticked.   In  answer  to
     question 16, she gives her husband's name as Salim Hassan Said.   This
     does not appear to be the same person as ............   We  were  also
     referred to paragraph 56 of her statement of 29 July 2003 in which she
     apologises for having stated in her  asylum  interview  that  she  was
     single when she was indeed married.   It is clear that this  paragraph
     does not refer to her marriage to ................   We  do  not  know
     what the explanation for this is.  Nor did we consider it  appropriate
     to ask Mr Nicholson to take  instructions  on  the  matter.   For  the
     purposes of this appeal, we are content to decide  the  issue  on  the
     basis that there is a valid  explanation.   That  does  not,  however,
     answer the problem that if there are issues as to the  validity  of  a
     marriage, they are unlikely to be satisfactorily resolved in Article 8
     proceedings.  Mr Nicholson submitted that the level of scrutiny  in  a
     marriage application may well be greater.  We accept this  may  be  so
     but that is no reason why  Article  8  should  operate  as  an  easier
     alternative.  We reject his  submission  that  the  Human  Rights  Act
     should be used to cut through  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
     Rules.

 17. We were not persuaded that there are any insurmountable  obstacles  in
     the Claimant seeking leave to enter by applying to  do  so  under  the
     Rules in Amman.

 18. We have also considered the delay in  processing  an  application  for
     entry clearance.  It is not necessary to determine whether it  is  for
     the  Claimant  to  establish  that  the  delay   in   likely   to   be
     disproportionate or whether it  is  for  the  Secretary  of  State  to
     establish that the interference is proportionate  and,  therefore,  to
     adduce positive evidence about average waiting times.  In the  present
     case we have no information as to the likely  period  the  application
     will take to process.  There  is  no  material  upon  which  we  could
     properly infer that the delay will be inordinate.   If  the  appellant
     wished to advance that point, it would have been open to her to  write
     to the Embassy in Amman and make enquiries. On a practical  level,  at
     hearings before an adjudicator, the appellant  is  entitled  to  raise
     Article 8 issues, the precise nature of  which  may  well  not  emerge
     prior to the hearing.  A  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  (even  if
     present) will be unlikely to know the current  state  of  the  waiting
     lists in all of the British Missions across the world.   Consequently,
     it may be relatively unlikely in most appeals of  this  type  for  the
     adjudicator  to  have  evidence  as  to  how  long  an  out-of-country
     application will take.

 19. There is, however, a more substantial point than whether the burden of
     proving a disproportionate delay falls upon the Claimant. We  find  it
     difficult to envisage the circumstances in which the delay in  dealing
     with an application would result in  a  violation  of  an  applicant's
     human rights, unless, perhaps, the delay is so long that, irrespective
     of any excuse, no one in good  conscience  could  disregard  it.   Our
     reason for saying this  is  because  it  will  be  impossible  for  an
     Adjudicator to form a judgment on  the  operational  reasons  for  the
     delay.  Delays are normally occasioned by shortage of staff,  but  may
     be occasioned by security or  other  considerations.   A  shortage  of
     staff may arise through lack of resources or an inability  to  recruit
     suitable  personnel.   It  is  entirely   within   the   policy-making
     discretion of the Secretary of State to determine the budget  for  any
     given overseas Mission.  It is not for an Adjudicator to  decide  that
     more resources should be directed towards entry clearance applications
     as opposed to official entertaining, maintaining buildings or  Embassy
     cars.  An Adjudicator will, of course, be entirely unaware of the ease
     (or difficulty) the Foreign Office, or the Home Office, encounters  in
     the recruitment and training  of  staff,  particularly  in  a  foreign
     Mission.   On  a  wider  scale,  only  government  can  determine  the
     resources it will allocate to the Foreign Office or  the  Home  Office
     and whether those resources should be expended on immigration control,
     law and order, education or health.  If an Adjudicator determines that
     a delay of six months is disproportionate, he is determining that  the
     Secretary of State should expend  more  resources  in  the  particular
     budget with which the Adjudicator is concerned in  the  appeal  before
     him.  The Secretary of State is concerned with the nation's  resources
     overall.   We  do  not  see  how,  in  assessing  proportionality,  an
     Adjudicator can arrogate to himself that responsibility.

 20. Mr Davidson sought to introduce medical evidence that  was  served  on
     the Tribunal on the day of the hearing and  which  is  dated  27  July
     2004, some seven days before.  The report from  Dr  Faruqui  from  the
     West London Mental Health Trust diagnoses the  Claimant  as  suffering
     from a moderately severe depressive disorder with PTSD said to be as a
     direct consequence of torture and  humiliation  she  faced  whilst  in
     custody in Iraq.  Those events, of course, took  place  prior  to  the
     Claimant's flight to Jordan in  February  1997  and  whilst  Iraq  was
     governed by Sadaam Hussein.  It is, perhaps, significant that she fled
     to Jordan in 1997 where she remained  for  about  four  months  before
     coming to the United Kingdom.  There is no suggestion that appropriate
     medical facilities are not available in Jordan  during  her  temporary
     return there.  In our judgment, a return to Jordan for the purposes of
     seeking entry clearance, with or without her husband, is not  rendered
     disproportionate as a result of her medical condition.

 21. A final point was taken by Mr Nicholson.  He submitted  that  detailed
     submissions were made in  relation  to  difficulties  in  obtaining  a
     travel document to  enable  the  Claimant  to  travel  to  Iraq.   The
     Adjudicator did not deal  with  these  matters.   Regardless  of  what
     evidence existed in relation to this issue, if the Secretary of  State
     cannot arrange appropriate travel documentation for this Claimant, she
     cannot be returned to Iraq.  If she cannot be returned to Iraq,  there
     can be no violation of her human rights.  This is the  point  made  by
     the  Tribunal   in   YL   (Nationality-Statelessness-Eritrea-Ethiopia)
     Eritrea CG [2003] UKIAT 00016  (Dr HH Storey, Chairman)  in  which  it
     was said:

           62...The judgment in [Saad, Diriye and Osorio  [2001]  EWCA  Civ
           2008 [2002] INLR 34] clearly  holds  that  the  existing  appeal
           structure governing appeals against refusal of  asylum  entitles
           appellants to a decision in relation to refugee status. In  each
           case  the  decision  facing  the  appellate  authority  is   the
           hypothetical one of whether removal would  be  contrary  to  the
           Convention at the time of the hearing - i.e. on the basis of the
           refugee status of the appellant at that time. Accordingly,  even
           if there are practical obstacles in the form of a refusal by the
           authorities of the receiving state to re-admit an appellant, the
           appeal  on  asylum  grounds  nevertheless  requires  substantive
           consideration on the hypothetical basis of whether - if returned
           - an appellant would face a real risk of persecution.


           63. However, we cannot see that the same  principle  applies  in
           respect of human rights grounds of appeal. The decision appealed
           against is one and the same but, in contrast the position  under
           the Refugee Convention, success in a human  rights  appeal  does
           not in itself result in any status  at  international  law,  nor
           indeed in domestic  law.  Furthermore  Strasbourg  jurisprudence
           considers that practicalities  in  relation  to  return  are  of
           central importance. If the threat of  removal  is  not  imminent
           then  there  can  be  no  violation  of  the   Convention:   see
           Vijayanathan and Pushparajah v France (1993) 15 EHRR 62. Plainly
           if Home Office policy is either not to remove or  to  return  to
           the UK persons whom destination countries  will  not  accept  as
           entitled to return, there is no meaningful sense in which  there
           can be said to be an imminent threat of removal in the  case  of
           persons falling under this policy.

 22. For these reasons, we are satisfied that the Adjudicator made an error
     of law in his assessment of the Article 8 claim.  In our judgment, the
     Claimant's return to Iraq for the purpose of seeking  entry  clearance
     in Amman will not violate her rights to private or family life.

Decision: The appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed.
