For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. We  see  no  need  for,  and  do  not  make,  an  order  restricting
       publication of the details of this appeal.

    2. This is an appeal by a citizen of Pakistan, born in 1983, against  a
       decision of the Secretary of State on 8 July 2013 to refuse to  vary
       his leave to remain in the United Kingdom as  a  student  under  the
       points-based system.  The Decision and  Reasons  explains  that  the
       application is refused because the appellant  did  not  produce  the
       required evidence in the required time.

    3. The most relevant part of the decision  is  under  Section  B  which
       states:

         "As the closing date of the bank statement submitted in support  of
         your application is dated 20 June 2013, you need to  show  evidence
         of �2,000 maintenance for 28 days from 23 May 2013 to 20 June 2013.
           However  your  bank  statements  demonstrate  that  you  are   in
         possession of no more than �300 between 23 May 2013 and 29 May 2013
         during that period.  As such, you have not  demonstrated  that  you
         have the level of funds required over the specific 28 day period to
         be granted as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant."

    4. The document set out clearly the Secretary of  State's  reasons  for
       refusing the application and informed the appellant of his right  of
       appeal which he exercised.  The  grounds  of  appeal  are  that  the
       decision is not in accordance with the  Immigration  Rules  and  the
       discretion under the Rules should have been exercised differently.

    5. We note that there is no  suggestion  there  that  the  decision  is
       contrary to the appellant's rights under the European Convention  on
       Human Rights, nor is there anything that we see  in  the  papers  to
       suggest that the appellant would have a well founded appeal on human
       rights grounds.

    6. In his grounds the first point taken by the appellant is that he had
       produced a more helpful bank statement before the decision was  made
       and  this  was  not  considered.   He   then   refers   to   various
       authoritative decisions which we do not consider to be on  point  at
       all.

    7. The case was heard by the First-tier Tribunal  on  the  papers.  The
       First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal and  the  appellant  sought
       permission.  Permission was refused by the First-tier  Tribunal  and
       by the Upper Tribunal but the appellant sought judicial  review  and
       as a result of a decision of Mr Justice Dove the  decision  was  set
       aside and the Deputy President in  due  course  gave  permission  to
       appeal.

    8. The relevant part of the decision of  Mr  Justice  Dove  is  in  the
       following terms:

         "It seems that the Secretary of State's decision and  that  of  the
         Immigration  Judge  (together  with  those   who   considered   the
         applications for appeal at the FTT and UT) proceeded on  the  basis
         that the closing date of the bank statement was 20 June  2013,  but
         as the claimant points out on its face the bank statement ends with
         the balance on 25 June 2013.  It is  at  least  therefore  arguable
         that there was an error of law in the Secretary of State's decision
         and the subsequent decisions on the appeals.  The decision has very
         serious consequences for the claimant and I am satisfied that these
         amount to a compelling reason for the  case  to  be  heard.   I  am
         therefore of the view that the requirements of CPR 54.7A(7) are met
         and this case and permission should be granted."

    9. We have in our papers two  possibly  relevant  photocopy  documents.
       These are documents prepared for us and are copies of documents sent
       to the Home Office. One is the bank statement  that  was  considered
       and it finishes on 20 June 2013.  The other is  the  bank  statement
       that the appellant says should have been considered and it  finishes
       on 25 June 2013.

   10. We wish to say straightaway that, with respect to the decision of Mr
       Justice Dove, the bank statement finishing 25 June does not  satisfy
       the requirements of the Rules because, if we look back 28 days  from
       25 June we get not to 29 May where the balance exceeded  �2,000  but
       to the day before that when the balance was only �300.  So it  seems
       to us that even if this bank statement is all that  it  purports  to
       be, and even if it had been available to  the  Secretary  of  State,
       which it  was  not,  it  would  not  have  led  to  the  application
       succeeding.

   11. However there are several things  about  that  bank  statement  that
       concern us.  Mr Tarlow provided us  with  the  copy  served  on  the
       Secretary of State. We stress the word  copy  because  although  the
       Rules require original documents the document in Mr Tarlow's  bundle
       was not an original document but was plainly a photocopy.  There  is
       no other sensible explanation for the fading  of  the  black  print.
       Unlike the document that was produced it did not have a  stamp  from
       the bank showing the bank statement and the address. No  explanation
       is given to explain how a statement could be issued on  25  June  in
       exactly the same form as the statement issued on 20 June.

   12. The disputed bank statement is numbered 167 as is the bank statement
       that was relied upon, and to our untrained eye we  are  not  at  all
       satisfied that the title "Your transactions 20 May 2013 to  25  June
       2013" is in the same size font as the  similar  endorsement  on  the
       bank statement originally relied upon.

   13. Had the appellant attended before us we would have  wanted  to  hear
       his evidence about the provenance of that statement.  The  appellant
       did not attend.  We made enquiries through our usher  who  tried  to
       contact the appellant using the number found in  the  papers.  There
       was no reply from that number. We checked that a Notice  of  Hearing
       had been sent to last known address.  It  had,  and,  as  Mr  Tarlow
       pointed out, that was also the address shown on the bank statements.
       Mr Tarlow also confirmed that the  address  was  one  known  to  the
       respondent.

   14. It was clear to us that the appellant had been given  proper  notice
       of  the  hearing  in  accordance  with  the  Rules  and  offered  no
       explanation for his absence and we decided  to  go  ahead  with  the
       hearing in his absence.

   15. We have gone through the evidence, we hope with conspicuous care. It
       seems to us that his case is entirely hopeless; that the decision of
       the First-tier Tribunal was entirely sound and we wonder, if we  may
       respectfully make this observation, if Mr Justice  Dove  would  have
       made the decision that he did if the matters of  concern  about  the
       statement and the fact that it did not cover a 28  day  period  with
       the funds in excess of  �1,000  had  been  expressly  drawn  to  his
       attention.

   16. It follows we are satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal did not err
       in law and we dismiss this appeal.
