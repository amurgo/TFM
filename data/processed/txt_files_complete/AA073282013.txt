Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Parkinson of Counsel, instructed by Hackney Law
Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Paul dismissed  this  appeal  on  asylum
   and human rights grounds.  In doing so it appears that he made a  finding
   that  the  appellant  is  a  minor  but  would  have  adequate  reception
   facilities through his family in Nigeria.

2) The appellant's date of birth was disputed.   Permission  to  appeal  was
   granted on the basis of an application which contended that the judge did
   not make an adequate finding as to whether the appellant was born  on  14
   July 1991 or 14 July 1996.  It was further contended that the  judge  did
   not pay sufficient attention to the "best interests assessment"  required
   by section 55 of the 2009 Act; that the judge failed properly to consider
   the respondent's  "tracing  obligation";  and  that  in  his  credibility
   assessment the judge paid inadequate attention to the  finding  that  the
   appellant is a minor.

3) In his determination the judge noted that the appellant came  to  the  UK
   in March 2011 with a student visa.  He travelled on a direct flight using
   his own passport containing a valid visa.  The  date  of  birth  in  this
   passport was 14 July 1991.  In May 2013 the appellant claimed asylum  and
   stated that his correct date of birth was 14 July  1996.   The  appellant
   submitted a cancelled passport showing his date of birth as 14 July  1991
   and a new passport containing the date of birth of 14 July 1996.

4) The appellant further claimed that he was born in Suleja  in  Nigeria  to
   ethnic Igbo parents and brought up by them as  a  Pentecostal  Christian.
   Around October 2010 the  appellant  was  attacked  by  Muslims  and  left
   unconscious.  He spent 2-3 months in hospital as a result of this attack.
   He claims to fear persecution in Nigeria due to his Pentecostal faith and
   to fear persecution on the grounds of  his  religion  from  the  militant
   Islamist group, the Boko Haram.  According to the appellant, in  December
   2011 his mother died and the appellant returned  to  Nigeria  in  January
   2012 for the funeral.  Later in 2012 the appellant lost contact with  his
   father and travelled back to Nigeria in June of that  year  to  look  for
   him.  He reported him missing and was told in August that the authorities
   believed that he had been killed  by  an  extremist  Muslim  group.   His
   return to Nigeria came about because his father's financial  support  had
   stopped and the appellant was unable to continue his studies.  His return
   to Nigeria in June 2012 was funded by his  church  in  the  UK.   At  his
   church he had met a benefactor,  Mrs  Bernadette  Stuart,  who  gave  the
   appellant accommodation in her home and contributed to his tuition  fees.
   It was she who took him to the Nigerian Embassy in London to have  a  new
   passport issued with his changed date of birth and took him to  the  Home
   Office  in  Croydon  to  explain  his  situation   to   the   immigration
   authorities.  In  support  of  his  asylum  claim  he  produced  a  birth
   certificate dated 26 March 2013, confirmation dated 3  April  2013of  his
   date of birth from the  Nigerian  Immigration  Service  Headquarters,  an
   affidavit dated 5 April 2013 and a medical legal age assessment.

5) Both the appellant and Mrs Stuart gave  evidence  before  the  First-tier
   Tribunal.

6) Insofar as the appellant's age is concerned, the Judge of the  First-tier
   Tribunal noted that there was an age assessment submitted  on  behalf  of
   the appellant but none by the respondent.  The respondent instead  relied
   on undermining the appellant's credibility.  In particular the respondent
   submitted that the appellant had  travelled  to  the  UK  on  a  passport
   obtained for him by his father and then spent nearly two years in the  UK
   on the basis of that passport.  He applied to go to college on the  basis
   of his original date of birth.  The  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   accepted that these matters were of  some  substance  but  they  did  not
   amount to a direct rebuttal of the age  assessment  report.   Accordingly
   the judge concluded on balance that the appellant "may not have been born
   on 14 July 1991 and may have been born on or about 14 July 1996."

7) The Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  then  went  on  to  consider  the
   credibility of the appellant's evidence in relation to his  asylum  claim
   and the  reception  facilities  that  might  exist  in  Nigeria.   Having
   accepted that the appellant was a minor, the judge  sought  to  give  due
   allowance for the stress  of  giving  evidence  but  concluded  that  the
   appellant had not given a truthful account in his evidence.   He  further
   found Mrs Stuart to be "a totally unreliable witness".

8) The judge noted that according to Mrs Stuart in her evidence she  made  a
   phone call to the  Nigerian  High  Commission  in  Abuja  to  obtain  the
   appellant's birth certificate and the immigration  document  relating  to
   the his date of birth.  The judge pointed  out  that  the  Nigerian  High
   Commission existed in  countries  outside  Nigeria.   It  was  stretching
   belief that by making a phone call to an official office in  Nigeria  the
   authorities then obtained the documents either from the hospital  or  the
   Magistrates' Court.  The judge did not believe  that  the  appellant  had
   visited Nigeria twice in 2012 and did not believe  that  his  father  had
   disappeared.  The judge concluded, at paragraph 40, that the "mere  fact"
   that the appellant was a youth did not mean that he could not  lie.   The
   judge did not accept  the  appellant's  evidence  that  his  parents  are
   deceased and that he has no siblings.  The  judge  did  not  accept  that
   simply by virtue of being a Christian a person was at risk of persecution
   in Nigeria without there being any adequate protection  from  the  State.
   The judge noted that Nigeria has a large Christian  population  which  is
   dominant in the south west and has communities all over the country.  The
   appellant's assertion that when he was  at  school  he  was  involved  in
   fights between Muslims and Christians had been  exaggerated  out  of  all
   proportion to try and make it look as if he would be a victim were he  to
   return.

Submissions

9) At the hearing before me Mr  Parkinson  for  the  appellant  acknowledged
   that the judge had made a finding that the appellant was  a  minor.   The
   question of whether such a finding had been made was raised as  an  issue
   in the application for permission to appeal.  The Secretary of State had,
   however, submitted a Rule 24 notice dated 21 October 2013 in which it was
   accepted that the judge found the appellant was a  minor.   According  to
   the respondent though, it did not follow that because the appellant was a
   minor the judge was bound to accept his claim as credible.

10) Mr Parkinson developed his argument by stating that as it  was  accepted
   that the appellant was a minor the Secretary of State  had  breached  her
   policy on processing an asylum claim by a minor.  When the appellant  was
   interviewed he had not been accompanied by a responsible  adult  but  the
   respondent  sought  to  rely  on  inconsistencies  at  the  interview  to
   challenge the appellant's  credibility.   The  Judge  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal had not properly considered the best interests of the child  and
   did not refer specifically to section 55.  The appellant's interests as a
   minor were considered only in relation to reception arrangements but  not
   in relation to his asylum claim or Article  8.   The  judge  observed  at
   paragraph 32 that if the appellant was a minor the Secretary of State had
   not applied the policy in relation  to  an  unaccompanied  asylum-seeking
   child and therefore, on the face of it, the appellant  should  have  been
   granted discretionary leave.  The merits of the asylum claim should  have
   been considered only if the appellant was an adult.  The  requirement  to
   consider  reception  facilities  came  from  paragraph   352ZC   of   the
   Immigration Rules,  which  required  adequate  reception  facilities  and
   entitlement to discretionary leave.  There were benefits  from  obtaining
   discretionary leave, such as the  opportunity  to  apply  for  it  to  be
   extended.

11) Mr Parkinson continued that  the  judge  did  not  properly  assess  the
   appellant's evidence on the basis that he  was  minor,  for  example,  in
   interpreting the appellant's distress when giving  evidence.   The  judge
   made an error of law by not finding a breach of the Secretary of  State's
   policy, in accordance with AA (Afghanistan)  [2007]  EWCA  Civ  12.   The
   application was not considered as that of an unaccompanied asylum-seeking
   child.  The appellant's status as a minor was  relevant  further  to  any
   question of internal relocation in Nigeria.  In terms of DS (Afghanistan)
   [2011] EWCA Civ 305 there  was  a  duty  to  have  consideration  to  the
   appellant's age in considering the asylum application and to the question
   of reception facilities.  These duties applied  even  if  the  child  was
   lying.  The proper course for the judge would  have  been  to  remit  the
   appeal back to the Secretary of State.

12) For the respondent, Mr Wilding submitted that there was no error in  the
   judge's determination, save for one that he had noticed only  during  the
   course of the present hearing.  This was that  the  appellant  had  leave
   from 18 March 2011 to 30 August 2013 and his appeal was  therefore  under
   section  83  of  the  2002  Act  rather  than  section  82.   Mr  Wilding
   acknowledged that the judge's findings about  the  appellant's  age  were
   expressed in an odd way.  The judge relied on discrepancies arising  from
   cross-examination and from the asylum interview.   The  judge  found  the
   evidence of the appellant and his witness to  be  completely  incredible.
   The witness, Mrs Stuart, was not believed. In  the  respondent's  refusal
   letter  it  was  not  accepted  that  the  appellant  was  a  minor   and
   notwithstanding the finding the judge made on the appellant's age, it did
   not follow that the judge could not make credibility findings.  This case
   was not the same as AA (Afghanistan) or DS (Afghanistan) for two reasons.
    The first was the appellant had leave, although it had now expired,  but
   he had 6 weeks left when his claim was refused.  He was  not  denied  the
   benefits of leave.  In addition,  the  negative  credibility  finding  in
   respect of the appellant's claim that his father  was  dead  had  a  huge
   bearing  on  his  status  as  an  unaccompanied   asylum-seeking   child.
   Reference was made to the case of EU (Afghanistan) [2013] EWCA Civ 32.

13) Mr Wilding continued that Mrs Stuart had been found by the judge  to  be
   a total liar. Nigeria was not like Afghanistan.  The appellant had  leave
   to remain at  the  time  his  asylum  claim  was  refused.   He  was  not
   disadvantaged by not having the benefit of leave.  There were two aspects
   to the policy, one of which was leave and the other was  family  contact.
   The  rationale  for  the  policy  applied  less  as  a  child  approached
   adulthood.  There was  no  rule  to  say  that  a  19-year-old  might  be
   disbelieved but a 15-year-old could not be disbelieved.  The  appellant's
   evidence was totally disbelieved.

14) Mr Wilding pointed out that in  the  respondent's  reasons  for  refusal
   letter of 17 July 2013 the asylum claim was assessed on the basis that it
   was taken at its highest, notwithstanding that  the  appellant's  account
   was not believed, and it was considered by the Secretary  of  State  that
   there was a sufficiency  of  protection  in  Nigeria  and  that  internal
   relocation was a viable option for the appellant.   The  judge  had  done
   what he was supposed to do, which was to make  findings  on  age  and  on
   credibility.  The credibility findings showed that the appellant's  claim
   was entirely without merit.  The appellant had faked the claim  that  his
   father was dead but this was done  on  the  supporting  evidence  of  Mrs
   Stuart.  The decision of the Secretary of State was  not  unlawful.   The
   appellant had not been disadvantaged by not being granted  leave.   There
   was no question of inadequate reception facilities in Nigeria.  There was
   no need for the judge to have remitted  the  case  to  the  Secretary  of
   State.  The appellant was now less than 2 months away from  becoming  17�
   years old, which was a relevant factor in terms of EU (Afghanistan).  The
   duty to trace applied with less force with increasing age.

15) Mr Parkinson responded that the adverse  credibility  findings  went  to
   the heart of the decision.  The judge  had  not  considered  whether  the
   credibility findings derived from a breach of  the  respondent's  policy.
   The judge should have considered what prejudice arose for  the  appellant
   from the breach of the policy.  He was not afforded  the  safeguards  and
   protection of the policy.  It was not relevant that the appellant was not
   approaching 17� years old.

Discussion

16) In his submission for the respondent, Mr Wilding sought  to  distinguish
   the  present  appeal  from  the  cases  of  AA   (Afghanistan)   and   DS
   (Afghanistan).  One distinction he made was that the appellant had  leave
   at the time  he  made  his  asylum  claim  and  there  was  therefore  no
   requirement for the Secretary of State to consider granting  leave.   The
   other distinction was that the judge made a negative credibility  finding
   in respect of the appellant's claim that his father had been  killed  and
   this affected the tracing obligation in respect of reception arrangements
   in Nigeria.

17) I  consider  that  both  of  these  points  carry  considerable  weight,
   particularly as the respondent did not accept at the time when the asylum
   claim was under consideration that the appellant was a minor.  A  finding
   to this effect was made only by the First-tier Tribunal on appeal.

18) Mr Parkinson submitted that having made this finding the  Judge  of  the
   First-tier Tribunal should have remitted the appeal to the  Secretary  of
   State for the procedures involving unaccompanied asylum-seeking  children
   to be properly observed.  One of the procedures which it was said was not
   properly observed by the respondent  referred  to  the  asylum  interview
   conducted on behalf of the respondent on 30 May 2013.  It  was  submitted
   that  the  appellant  should  not  have  been  interviewed  when  he  was
   unaccompanied.  At the hearing before me, however,  it  was  pointed  out
   that  according  to  the  interview  record   the   appellant's   current
   representatives,  Hackney  Community  Law   Centre   were   recorded   as
   representing the appellant but were not present.  No reason is given  for
   the absence of a representative from the Law Centre.

19) Be that as it may,  the  potential  consequences  of  a  breach  of  the
   respondent's policy were considered in EU (Afghanistan).  In the judgment
   of Sir Stanley Burnton it was pointed  out  that  for  a  breach  of  the
   Secretary of State's policy to give rise  to  a  remedy  for  the  asylum
   seeker it must be shown that there  was  a  causative  link  between  the
   Secretary of  State's  breach  of  duty  and  the  appellant's  claim  to
   protection (paragraph 7).  Sir Stanley Burnton quoted with approved  from
   the judgment of Maurice Kay LJ in KA (Afghanistan) [2012] EWCA  Civ  1014
   in which reference was made to a spectrum, at one end  of  which  was  an
   applicant who gave a credible  and  co-operative  account  of  having  no
   surviving family in Afghanistan or having lost touch with family  members
   and having failed, notwithstanding his best endeavours,  to  re-establish
   contact.  At the other end of the spectrum was an applicant  whose  claim
   to have no surviving family in Afghanistan was disbelieved and in respect
   of whom it was found that he had been unco-operative so as  to  frustrate
   any attempt to trace his family.  Such a  person  would  have  failed  to
   prove a risk on return and there would be no causative link  between  the
   Secretary of  State's  breach  of  duty  and  the  appellant's  claim  to
   protection.

20) I may add that there is no  question  so  far  as  I  am  aware  of  any
   deliberate breach of duty by the Secretary of State  in  respect  of  the
   present appeal.  The refusal decision was made  on  the  basis  that  the
   Secretary of State did not accept that the appellant  was  a  minor.   An
   attempt is now made to  show  prejudice  to  the  appellant  because  the
   appellant was not given the  benefit  of  the  policy  for  unaccompanied
   asylum-seeking  children.   As  was  pointed  out  in  EU  (Afghanistan),
   however, in order to rely  on  the  policy  the  appellant  must  show  a
   causative link between the Secretary of State's breach of  duty  and  the
   claimed protection.  The difficulty for the appellant is in  establishing
   such a link.

21) Furthermore, as Mr Wilding pointed out in his submission,  according  to
   Sir Stanley Burnton at paragraph 8 of his judgment, a further issue to be
   taken into account is the  line  between  minority  and  adulthood.   The
   rationale relating to the return of an unaccompanied young child  applies
   with less force with increasing age.

22) The position found by the Secretary of State in  the  refusal  decision,
   and accepted by the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal on appeal, was  that
   even if the appellant's asylum claim was taken at its highest, he had  no
   claim to refugee status or to humanitarian protection.  This was because,
   first, there was a sufficiency of protection for  Christians  in  Nigeria
   and, second, there was the possibility  of  internal  relocation  if  the
   appellant had a well founded fear of persecution in his  home  area.   As
   far as I am aware, the first of these points is not disputed.  So far  as
   the second is concerned, Mr Parkinson submitted that the question of  the
   appellant's age was relevant to the viability of internal  relocation  on
   the basis that it would be unduly harsh  or  unreasonable  to  expect  an
   unaccompanied child to relocate.

23) The difficulty for Mr Parkinson in pursuing this argument  is  that  the
   Judge of the First-tier Tribunal found that the appellant would not be an
   unaccompanied child were he to return to Nigeria.  The judge  simply  did
   not accept that both the appellant's parents were deceased  and  that  he
   had lost contact with his family.

24) To address this point,  Mr  Parkinson  submitted  that  the  appellant's
   credibility had not been assessed as it should have been as a  minor  and
   that the interview was not carried out fairly as it should have been  for
   an unaccompanied minor.

25) So far as the appellant's evidence at  the  hearing  is  concerned,  the
   judge specifically stated at paragraph 37 that he had taken into  account
   that the appellant was a minor and given due allowance to the  stress  of
   giving evidence,.  The judge then went on to observe at paragraph 40 that
   "the mere fact that the appellant is a youth does not mean that he cannot
   lie, and I am satisfied  that  the  lies  were  bolstered  by  the  false
   distress that he put on to try and convince the Tribunal."

26) It seems to me that these  findings  are  adequate  expressions  by  the
   judge of the need to be aware of age-related factors when  assessing  the
   evidence of a minor.  As the judge pointed out, it does not  follow  from
   this that the minor's evidence must be believed.

27) The second point on which Mr Parkinson relies on  this  regard  is  that
   the adverse credibility finding was based in part on  inconsistencies  in
   the appellant's asylum interview  and  these  inconsistencies  would  not
   necessarily have arisen had the proper policy  for  the  interviewing  of
   unaccompanied asylum-seeking children been followed.

28) A similar point arose in AA (Afghanistan), in which  it  was  said  that
   the Secretary of State's policy, as it  stood  in  March  2003  when  the
   interview  under  consideration  in  that  case  took  place,   that   an
   unaccompanied minor seeking asylum should not have been interviewed other
   than in exceptional circumstances and only then by  a  specially  trained
   officer and in the presence of a responsible adult.  The  Court  accepted
   that there was a breach of the policy and that the adjudicator  (as  then
   termed) might not have made the same finding if aware of  the  policy  on
   such interviews.  The claim is made in the present appeal  not  that  the
   appellant should not have been interviewed but that the interview  should
   have taken place in the presence of a responsible adult and the  decision
   on behalf of the respondent taken by a person trained to deal with asylum
   claims from children.

29) The circumstances of this appeal, however,  are  rather  different  from
   those in AA (Afghanistan).  In that case,  had  the  appellant's  account
   been believed, it appears that he would have qualified for refugee status
   or  humanitarian  protection.   In  the  current  appeal,  however,   the
   Secretary of State's position, accepted by the Judge  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal, was that even were the appellant's claim taken at its  highest,
   he would not be entitled to refugee status  or  humanitarian  protection.
   This was simply because he did not face a real  risk  of  persecution  or
   serious harm in Nigeria by reason of religion.  The  adverse  credibility
   finding made by the judge was principally directed not to refusal of  the
   substantive asylum claim but to refusal of  the  claim  that  there  were
   inadequate reception facilities in Nigeria for the appellant.

30) This brings me back to Mr Parkinson's argument  that  if  the  appellant
   had been properly regarded as a minor, then this would have shown that it
   was not a viable option for him to relocate  internally  within  Nigeria.
   This argument, of course, relies on the assumption that the appellant was
   telling the truth about the death of both of his parents and that it  was
   this adverse credibility finding made by  the  Judge  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal in respect of the deaths of the appellant's parents that led  to
   the refusal of the appellant's claim for refugee status.

31) Mr Parkinson's argument in this regard deserves  further  consideration.
   I start with the age of the appellant at the date of the interview, which
   was conducted on 30 May 2013.  A finding has been made that the appellant
   was born on 14 July 1996.  Accordingly, he would have been about 6  weeks
   short of his 17th birthday at the time he was interviewed.  By this  time
   he had been studying in the UK away from family  support  for  about  two
   years.  I mention this only to indicate that although the appellant was a
   minor at the time he was interviewed, he was a minor who  was  accustomed
   to a considerable degree of independence.

32) One of the points arising from the interview, which was founded upon  by
   the respondent, related to an affidavit produced by the appellant  giving
   his date of birth as 14 July 1996.  According  to  the  respondent,  this
   affidavit bore to have been signed by the appellant's father on  5  April
   2013, which was some 14 months after the appellant's father  was  alleged
   to have disappeared and was presumed dead.  At his asylum  interview  the
   appellant was asked to explain  this  inconsistency  and  said  that  the
   affidavit came from the Magistrates' Court.  It was Mrs  Stuart  who  had
   made a call to them and someone had to sign the affidavit.  The appellant
   said it had not been signed by his own father.

33) The same issue arose when the appellant was giving evidence  before  the
   First-tier Tribunal.  The appellant contended that the affidavit was true
   (as to its content) but it was sworn by his uncle,  not  by  his  father.
   The judge noted, however, that on the face of it the person swearing  the
   affidavit stated that he was the biological father of the appellant.

34) Another issue which arose from the  interview  was  when  the  appellant
   first became aware that he had given an incorrect  date  of  birth.   The
   appellant said at interview that he did not become aware  of  this  until
   around October or November 2012.  It  was  submitted  on  behalf  of  the
   respondent at the hearing that by this time the appellant had been living
   in the UK for nearly two years and that he had applied to  a  college  in
   London in April 2011 on the basis of his date  of  birth  being  14  July
   1991.

35) In his evidence before the First-tier Tribunal the appellant  said  that
   he first became aware that his passport had the wrong date of birth  when
   he went to register with Crystal Palace as a  trainee  footballer  in  or
   about December 2011.  Because of this he went to the High Commission, who
   made enquiries and confirmed that his real date  of  birth  was  14  July
   1996.  He nevertheless accepted that he went to  Nigeria  twice  in  2012
   using his old passport.

36) These  discrepancies  in  the  evidence,  first  about  who  signed  the
   Affidavit of May 2013 and, second, when the appellant became  aware  that
   his date of  birth  was  incorrect,  are  not  matters  of  inference  or
   derivations from subtle distinctions of meaning which could have  led  to
   findings  either  for  or  against  the  appellant.    They   are   stark
   discrepancies in  the  appellant's  evidence  striking  directly  at  the
   credibility of his account.  The appellant had the opportunity before the
   First-tier  Tribunal  to  provide   adequate   explanations   for   these
   inconsistencies but could not do so and instead appears  to  have  broken
   down when giving evidence in what the  judge  described  as  "a  show  of
   distress so as to try and bolster what I consider to be  a  fundamentally
   false account."  The judge  made  this  finding  while  expressly  having
   regard to the appellant's age.

37) The position is that this was an asylum claim found by the Judge of  the
   First-tier Tribunal to be entirely without merit.  It is at the  far  end
   of the spectrum referred to in the case of EU  (Afghanistan),  where  the
   appellant has failed to prove the risk on return and shown  no  causative
   link between the Secretary of State's breach of duty  and  his  claim  to
   protection.   For  such  an  appellant,  there  is  great  difficulty  in
   establishing a disadvantage from the Secretary of State's breach of duty.
    In other words, the causative link  between  the  Secretary  of  State's
   breach of duty  and  the  claim  to  protection  is  lacking.   The  same
   principle applies to the Secretary of State's duty  to  trace.   Although
   the Secretary of State has such a duty,  as  discussed  in  SHL  (Tracing
   Obligation/Trafficking)  Afghanistan   [2013]  UKUT  00312,   which   was
   referred to by the appellant in the application for permission to appeal,
   a breach of the tracing duty will not necessarily give rise to a grant of
   relief for the appellant.  It is incumbent on the  Tribunal  to  evaluate
   the effects and consequences of the breach in the fact sensitive  context
   under consideration.  In the circumstances of  the  present  appeal,  the
   appellant has not been able to show prejudice to his position by the lack
   of any attempt by the respondent to trace his family.

38) So far as the duty under section 55 is concerned to have regard  to  the
   best interests of the child, although as Mr Parkinson  pointed  out,  the
   Judge of the First-tier Tribunal did not refer at any point expressly  to
   section 55, nevertheless it is difficult to envisage in what way the best
   interests of the appellant as a child were not taken into account in  the
   decision.  The conclusion reached by the judge was that  the  appellant's
   family were waiting to receive him and support him on return to  Nigeria.
   Furthermore, as Mr Wilding pointed out, the only issues before the  judge
   were whether the appellant was entitled to be recognised as a refugee  or
   to be granted humanitarian protection in terms of section 83 of the  2002
   Act.  Mr Wilding suggested that the judge may have fallen into  error  by
   failing to recognise that this appeal was made  only  under  section  83,
   rather than under section 82 of the 2002 Act.  Although  the  judge  does
   not refer expressly to section 83, it is  clear  from  the  determination
   that the only issues he  was  considering  were  entitlement  to  refugee
   status or humanitarian protection.  The refusal decision before the judge
   dated 18 July 2013 was stated as having been made under  section  83  and
   there is no reason to suppose that the judge misdirected  himself  as  to
   the grounds on which the appeal was made.

39) The question of the appellant's right to private  or  family  life  was,
   accordingly, not before the First-tier Tribunal and it is in this respect
   that the best interests of the child might have  been  expected  to  have
   assumed some significance.  So far as this appeal is concerned, the judge
   was entitled to reach the  conclusion  which  he  did,  namely  that  the
   appellant would have adequate family  arrangements  waiting  for  him  in
   Nigeria and there would be no breach of the  Refugee  Convention  and  no
   real risk of serious harm were he to return there.

40) I have considered in some detail the arguments advanced by Mr  Parkinson
   in an attempt to establish that the  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   erred in law in making the decision which he did.  In  the  circumstances
   of this appeal, however, I do not consider that the arguments relied upon
   by Mr Parkinson are made out, for the reasons which I have  given  above.
   Accordingly the decision shall stand.

Conclusions

41) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve
   the making of an error on a point of law.

42) I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

43) Notwithstanding the finding as to age, the First-tier Tribunal  did  not
   make a direction for anonymity and no application for  such  a  direction
   was made before me.
