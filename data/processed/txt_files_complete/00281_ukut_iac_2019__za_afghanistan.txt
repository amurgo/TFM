    i) The requirement to have transferred the centre of one's life  to  the
       host member state is not a requirement of EU law, nor is it  endorsed
       by the CJEU.

   ii) Where an EU national of one  state  ("the  home  member  state")  has
       exercised the right of freedom of movement to take up work  or  self-
       employment in another EU state ("the host state"), his or her  family
       members have a derivative right to enter  the  member  state  if  the
       exercise of Treaty rights in the host  state  was  "genuine"  in  the
       sense that it was real, substantive,  or  effective.  It  is  for  an
       appellant to show that there had been a genuine  exercise  of  Treaty
       rights.

  iii)   The  question  of  whether  family  life  was  established   and/or
       strengthened, and whether there has been a genuine exercise of Treaty
       rights requires a qualitative assessment which will be  fact-specific
       and will need to bear in mind the following:

          1) Any work  or  self-employment  must  have  been  "genuine  and
             effective" and not marginal or ancillary;

          2) The assessment of whether a stay in the host state was genuine
             does not involve  an  assessment  of  the  intentions  of  the
             parties over and above a consideration of  whether  what  they
             intended to do was in fact to exercise Treaty rights;

          3) There is no requirement for the EU national or his  family  to
             have integrated into the host member state, nor for  the  sole
             place of residence to be  in  the  host  state;  there  is  no
             requirement to have severed ties with the home  member  state;
             albeit that  these  factors  may,  to  a  limited  degree,  be
             relevant to the qualitative assessment of whether the exercise
             of Treaty rights was genuine.

   iv) If it is alleged that the stay in the host member state was such that
       reg. 9 (4) applies, the burden is on the Secretary of State  to  show
       that there was an abuse of rights.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against a decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge S H Smith, promulgated on 17 May  2018,  dismissing  her
    appeal against the decision of the respondent made on 13 February  2017
    under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2016  ("the
    2016 Regulations") to refuse her application for a  residence  card  as
    the family member of an EEA national.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of  Afghanistan.  She  and  her  husband,  a
    British citizen, were married in Pakistan in  2003.   Her  applications
    for entry clearance as a spouse in 2006 and 2008 were refused.

 3. As stated by the First-tier Tribunal at [6]  the  appellant's  case  is
    that her husband decided to leave the stress  of  London  and  move  to
    Ireland to exercise his free movement rights he enjoyed  under  the  EU
    Treaties, with the intention of settling in May 2015.  He worked  while
    there and learned from friends that it would be  possible  for  him  to
    apply for a visa for his wife to accompany him pursuant to EU law.   He
    successfully applied for a family permit on behalf of the appellant and
    she joined him in Ireland shortly afterwards.  His job came to  an  end
    in May 2016 and the couple, along with her children,  returned  to  the
    United Kingdom at the end of  the  month.   On  return,  the  appellant
    applied for a residence permit.

 4. The  respondent  concluded  from  the  information  provided  that  the
    appellant and her husband's residence in Ireland was  not  genuine  and
    that the purpose of  the  residence  in  Ireland  was  as  a  means  of
    circumventing the UK's domestic Immigration Rules.

 5. On appeal the judge noted [24] that the central issue  is  whether  the
    residence of the appellant and  sponsor  was  "genuine",  the  starting
    point for his analysis  being  that  the  motive  for  exercising  free
    movement rights in another member state is not a  determinative  factor
    in assessing whether residence was genuine, following  AA  (Nigeria)  v
    SSHD [2017] CSIH 38.  The judge also directed  himself  [13]  that  the
    Secretary of State bore the burden of demonstrating that  Regulation  9
    (4) applied but that this arises only if the applicant has succeeded in
    establishing that the residence was genuine in the first place.

 6. The judge did not accept that the family's  residence  in  Ireland  was
    genuine, noting that the picture that emerges from her evidence  was  a
    period of residence in Ireland which bears the hallmarks of having been
    staged or created in order to  generate  the  conditions  in  order  to
    benefit from a free movement right.  He found that the  centre  of  the
    appellant's life had not been transferred  to  Ireland  [32]  and  that
    while she and her husband lived in Ireland for a year, a weighty factor
    capable of potentially tipping the balance in favour of the  conclusion
    that the residence was genuine, he was not satisfied the residence  was
    genuine.

 7. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had erred:-

      i) in failing to take into account the fact that  the  motivation  for
         exercising treaty rights was irrelevant,  following  Akrich  [2003]
         EUECJ C-109/01;




     ii) in failing properly to apply  the  correct  Regulations,  with  the
         respondent purportedly applying the 2006  Regulations  rather  than
         the amendments brought in in 2013;




    iii) in failing properly to apply AA (Nigeria).




    The Law

 8. Schedule 6 of the 2016 Regulations provides at section 4, so far as  is
    relevant:

    4. (1) an application for -

    ...

    (c) a residence card

    ...

    Made but not determined before 1st February 2017 is to  be  treated  as
    having been made under these regulations.

 9. Schedule 2 to the 2016 Regulations provides, so far as is relevant:

    1. The following provisions of, or made under, the 2002 Act have effect
    in relation to an appeal under  these  Regulations  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal as if it were an appeal [against a decision of  the  Secretary
    of State under section 82(1) of the 2002 Act (right of  appeal  to  the
    Tribunal)-

      section 84 (grounds of appeal), as though the sole permitted ground of
      appeal were that the decision breaches the  appellant's  rights  under
      the EU Treaties in respect of entry to  or  residence  in  the  United
      Kingdom ("an EU ground of appeal");

10. The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 contained, as
    at the date of application, the same provision  within  schedule  1  to
    those Regulations.

11. The core issue in this case is correct interpretation of  Regulation  9
    of the 2016 Regulations which (as at the date of decision)  provide  as
    follows:-

         9.-(1) If the conditions in  paragraph  (2)  are  satisfied,  these
         Regulations apply to a person who is the family member ("f") of  an
         British Citizen ("BC") as though the BC were an EEA national

    (2)  The conditions are that-

            (a)   BC-

                  (i)  is residing in  an  EEA  State  as  a  worker,  self-
                  employed person, self-sufficient person or a  student,  or
                  so resided immediately  before  returning  to  the  United
                  Kingdom; or

                  (ii) has acquired the right of permanent residence  in  an
                  EEA State;

            (b)   F and BC resided together in the EEA State; and

            (c)   F and BC's residence in the EEA State was genuine.

         (3)  Factors relevant to whether residence in the EEA State  is  or
            was genuine include-

            (a)   whether the centre of BC's life transferred  to  the  EEA
                  State;

            (b)   the length of F and  BC's  joint  residence  in  the  EEA
                  State;

            (c)   the nature and quality of the F and BC's accommodation in
                  the EEA State, and whether it is  or  was  BC's  principal
                  residence;

            (d)   the degree of F and BC's integration in the EEA State;

            (e)   whether F's first lawful residence in the EU with BC  was
                  in the EEA State.

         (4)  This regulation does not apply-

            (a)   where the purpose of the residence in the EEA  State  was
                  as a means for circumventing any immigration laws applying
                  to non-EEA nationals to which F would otherwise be subject
                  (such as any applicable requirement under the 1971 Act  to
                  have leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom); or

            [(b)  to a person who is only  eligible  to  be  treated  as  a
                  family member as a result  of  regulation  7(3)  (extended
                  family members treated as family members).[1]]"







    Ground (ii)

12. It is convenient to deal with ground (ii) first, as it can  readily  be
    rejected. The application was made on 9 June 2016.  On 25 November 2016
    while  the  application  was  still  under   consideration   the   2016
    Regulations came into force but only in respect of  Regulation  44  and
    Schedule 5 of the 2016 Regulations.  The effect of this  was  to  bring
    Regulation 9 of the current 2016 Regulations into the 2006 Regulations.



13. On 1 February 2017 Regulation 44 and Schedule 5 of the 2016 Regulations
    were revoked.  This had the effect of removing Regulation  9  from  the
    2006  Regulations  but  paragraph  4(1)  of  Schedule  6  of  the  2016
    Regulations provides that applications outstanding at that date were to
    be considered in line with the 2016 Regulations.  The decision in  this
    case was made on 13 February 2017 and thus the correct Regulations were
    Regulation 9 of the 2016 Regulations as the judge properly noted.

    Grounds (i) and (iii)

14. These grounds overlap and, it being established which  version  of  the
    regulations apply, they fall to considered together.

15. The appellant contends that, on the basis of  AA(Nigeria),  O.  and  B.
    [2014] EUECJ C-456/12 and Akrich, the couple's intentions in seeking to
    live in another member state are not relevant. It is further  contended
    that the  judge  had  improperly  considered  motivation  in  assessing
    "genuine residence" and had, in effect, confused the issue of abuse  of
    rights and in so  doing  had  imported  the  abuse  of  rights  concept
    improperly into his consideration.

16. As an aside, it must be borne in mind that the assessment of intentions
    by the  member  state  of  a  worker  from  another  state  seeking  to
    regularise his position  are  very  limited.  Article  8  of  Directive
    2004/38 limits what can be asked for to identity documents and evidence
    of employment. This is  reflected  also  in  article  3  (2)  where  an
    extensive examination is limited to beneficiaries. While it is possible
    to invoke article  35  to  refuse,  terminate  or  withdraw  any  right
    conferred by the Directive in the case of abuse  of  rights  or  fraud,
    such as marriages of convenience, that is not a straightforward  issue.
    Broadly, following Emsland-St�rke  GmbH  v  Hauptzollamt  Hamburg-Jonas
    [2000] EUECJ  C-110/99)a two-stage process test is to be applied: first
    an objective test where by the objective  circumstances  must  indicate
    that, despite formal observance of  the  conditions  for  obtaining  an
    advantage provided by EU law, the purpose of the  rules  had  not  been
    fulfilled. Secondly, there must the intention to obtain  the  advantage
    by artificially creating the conditions laid down for obtaining it.

17. In order to qualify under regulation 9, an applicant  and  his  or  her
    British national spouse (or durable partner,  following  Banger  [2018]
    EUECJ C-89/17) must:

    (i) have resided in another member state; and

    (ii) that residence must have been genuine.

18. Both of those issues require careful analysis.

19. Regulation 9 is intended to put rulings of the CJEU interpreting the EU
    Treaties into domestic legislation and so a detailed  analysis  of  the
    case law is necessary.

20. In doing so it should be borne in mind that decisions of  the  ECJ  are
    written in French not English.  It is also to be  borne  in  mind  when
    interpreting European law that it is  an  autonomous  system  in  which
    words may have a specific meaning in European law. Great care needs  to
    be taken in assuming that words used by the legislator,  and  for  that
    matter the court, bear the same meaning as they do in Member States.

21. An analysis of the relevant case law must  begin  with  Surinder  Singh
    [1992] EUECJ C-370/90 where the Court of Justice said this:-

    19 A national of a Member State might  be  deterred  from  leaving  his
    country of origin in order to pursue an activity as an employed or self-
    employed person as envisaged by the Treaty in the territory of  another
    Member State if, on returning to the Member State  of  which  he  is  a
    national in order to pursue an activity there as an employed  or  self-
    employed person, the conditions of his entry and residence were not  at
    least equivalent to those which he would  enjoy  under  the  Treaty  or
    secondary law in the territory of another Member State.

    20 He would in particular be deterred from so doing if his  spouse  and
    children were not also permitted to enter and reside in  the  territory
    of his Member State of origin under conditions at least  equivalent  to
    those granted them by Community law in the territory of another  Member
    State.

    21 It follows that a national of a Member State who has gone to another
    Member State in order to work there as an employed person  pursuant  to
    Article 48 of the Treaty and returns to establish himself in  order  to
    pursue an activity as a self-employed person in the  territory  of  the
    Member State of which he is a national has the right, under Article  52
    of the Treaty, to be accompanied in the territory of the  latter  State
    by his spouse, a national of  a  non-member  country,  under  the  same
    conditions as are laid down by Regulation No 1612/68, Directive  68/360
    or Directive 73/148, cited above.

    22 Admittedly, as the United Kingdom submits, a national  of  a  Member
    State enters and resides in the territory of that State  by  virtue  of
    the rights attendant upon his nationality and not by  virtue  of  those
    conferred on him by Community  law.  In  particular,  as  is  provided,
    moreover,  by  Article  3  of  the  Fourth  Protocol  to  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights, a State  may  not  expel  one  of  its  own
    nationals or deny him entry to its territory.

    23 However, this case is concerned not with a right under national  law
    but with  the  rights  of  movement  and  establishment  granted  to  a
    Community national by Articles 48 and 52 of the  Treaty.  These  rights
    cannot be fully effective  if  such  a  person  may  be  deterred  from
    exercising them by obstacles raised in his or her country of origin  to
    the entry and residence of his  or  her  spouse.  Accordingly,  when  a
    Community national who has availed himself or herself of  those  rights
    returns to his or her country of origin, his or her spouse  must  enjoy
    at least the same rights of entry and residence as would be granted  to
    him or her under Community law if his or her spouse chose to enter  and
    reside in another Member State. Nevertheless, Articles 48 and 52 of the
    Treaty do not prevent Member States from applying to foreign spouses of
    their own nationals rules on entry and residence more  favourable  than
    those provided for by Community law.

    24 As regards the risk of fraud referred to by the United  Kingdom,  it
    is sufficient to note that, as the Court has consistently held (see  in
    particular the judgments in Case 115/78 Knoors v Secretary of State for
    Economic Affairs  [1979]  ECR  399,  paragraph  25,  and  Case  C-61/89
    Bouchoucha [1990] ECR I-3551, paragraph 14), the facilities created  by
    the Treaty cannot have the effect of allowing the persons  who  benefit
    from them to evade the  application  of  national  legislation  and  of
    prohibiting Member States from taking the measures necessary to prevent
    such abuse.

22. It is of note that motivations were not under consideration by the  ECJ
    in Surinder Singh. On the facts, that is unsurprising.  That is because
    having worked for two years in the Federal Republic of Germany, Mr  and
    Mrs Singh returned to the United  Kingdom  and  Mr  Singh  was  granted
    limited leave to remain under the Immigration  Rules.   His  wife  then
    subsequently sought to divorce him and the Secretary of State sought to
    cut short his leave to remain and to refuse  him  indefinite  leave  to
    remain.  It was only in a subsequent appeal against the  decision  made
    under Section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971  that  the  appellant
    raised the issue that he had a right under EU law to remain.  It should
    be borne in mind the legislation as it  was  then  enacted,  a  limited
    right of appeal against a Section 3(5)(a) deportation order to  whether
    there was a  power  in  law  to  make  the  decision.   The  court  was
    considering whether a right arose at all rather  than  any  motivations
    for travelling to Germany, remaining there or returning to  the  United
    Kingdom.

23. The next decision which requires consideration is Levin [1982] EUECJ R-
    53/81.  There, the Netherlands refused to issue a residence card to Mrs
    Levin, a British Citizen, accompanied by her non- EEA national  husband
    on the basis that Mrs Levin's income which was less  than  the  minimum
    requirement of subsistence, and so the issue arose whether  she  was  a
    "worker" in the  meaning  of  the  Treaty.  Those  issues  are  not  of
    relevance here, but the third question put by the referring  court  was
    as follows: -

         Can the  right  of  such  a  worker  to  free  admission  into  and
         establishment in the member state in which he pursues or wishes  to
         pursue an activity or provides or wishes to provide services  to  a
         limited extent still be relied upon if it is demonstrated or  seems
         likely that his chief motive for residing in that member  state  is
         for a purpose other than the pursuit of an activity or provision of
         services to a limited extent

    The CJEU replied:

         19. The third question essentially seeks to ascertain whether the
         right to enter and reside in the territory of a member state may be
         denied to a worker whose main objectives, pursued by means of his
         entry and residence, are different from that of the pursuit of an
         activity as an employed person as defined in the answer to the
         first and second questions.

         20 Under article 48 ( 3 ) of the treaty the right to move freely
         within the territory of the member states is conferred upon workers
         for the 'purpose' of accepting offers of employment actually made .
         By virtue of the same provision workers enjoy the right to stay in
         one of the member states 'for the purpose' of employment there.
         Moreover , it is stated in the preamble to regulation ( EEC ) no
         1612/68 that freedom of movement for workers entails the right of
         workers to move freely within the community ' in order to'  pursue
         activities as employed persons , whilst article 2 of directive
         68/360/EEC requires the member states to grant workers the right to
         leave their territory 'in order to' take up activities as employed
         persons or to pursue them in the territory of another member state.

         21 However , these formulations merely give expression to the
         requirement, which is inherent in the very principle of freedom of
         movement for workers, that the advantages which community law
         confers in the name of that freedom may be relied upon only by
         persons who actually pursue or seriously wish to pursue activities
         as employed persons. They do not , however , mean that the
         enjoyment of this freedom may be made to depend upon the aims
         pursued by a national of a member state in applying for entry upon
         and residence in the territory of another member state , provided
         that he there pursues or wishes to pursue an activity which meets
         the criteria specified above, that is to say , an effective and
         genuine activity as an employed person.

         22 Once this condition is satisfied, the  motives  which  may  have
         prompted  the  worker  to  seek  employment  in  the  member  state
         concerned  are  of  no  account  and  must  not   be   taken   into
         consideration.

24. Thus, the case is concerned  with  whether  the  motives  of  a  person
    seeking to exercise Treaty  Rights  in  a  member  state  (a  condition
    precedent to seeking to return to the member state of nationality)  are
    relevant to assessing whether he is entitled to a  permit  to  let  him
    stay, to which the answer is no, but  it  is   important  to  note  the
    proviso at the end of paragraph 21  and  the  emphasis  on  freedom  of
    movement for workers being  conferred  on  those  who  actually  pursue
    activities as employed persons.

25. I pause at this point to observe that the French original in  the  last
    sentence of paragraph [21] refers to an activity which  is  "r�elle  et
    effective".  In this context it is of note  that  in  regulation  31(5)
    that the trigger for a power to deport an EU national  is  whether  the
    individual represents as "genuine, present  and  sufficiently  serious,
    threat to the interests of society. "Genuine" in this context does  not
    have the connotation of being the opposite of "false"  and  the  French
    version again uses "r�elle" when English uses "genuine".

26. Following on from Levin, in Akrich, the CJEU noted [39] that

    Having found as a fact, inter alia, that Mr and Mrs Akrich had moved to
    Ireland for the express purpose of  subsequently  exercising  Community
    rights to enable them to return to the United Kingdom, the  Immigration
    Adjudicator nevertheless concluded that, as a matter of law, there  had
    been an effective exercise by Mrs Akrich of Community rights which  had
    not been tainted by the intentions of the spouses, and  that  they  had
    therefore not relied on Community law to evade the  provisions  of  the
    United Kingdom's national legislation. He also found that Mr Akrich did
    not constitute such a genuine and sufficiently serious threat to public
    policy as to justify the continuation of the deportation order.

27. The Court also held:


    55.  As regards the question of abuse mentioned at paragraph 24 of  the
    Singh judgment, cited above, it should be mentioned  that  the  motives
    which may have prompted a worker of a Member State to  seek  employment
    in another Member State are of no account as regards his right to enter
    and reside in the territory of the latter State provided that he  there
    pursues or wishes to pursue an effective  and  genuine  activity  (Case
    53/81 Levin [1982] ECR 1035, paragraph 23).

    56.  Nor are such motives relevant in assessing the legal situation  of
    the couple at the time of their return to the Member State of which the
    worker is a national. Such conduct cannot constitute  an  abuse  within
    the meaning of paragraph 24 of the Singh judgment even  if  the  spouse
    did not, at the time when the couple installed itself in another Member
    State, have a right to remain in the Member State of which  the  worker
    is a national.

28. As noted earlier, what is meant by "residence" must also be  considered
    and in that context I turn next to O. and B. [2014] EUECJ C-456/12. The
    questions raised were, so far as is relevant
       (1) Should Directive 2004/38 ..., as regards the conditions governing
       the right of residence of members of the family of  a  Union  citizen
       who have third-country nationality, be applied by analogy, as in  the
       judgments of the Court of Justice  of  the  European  Communities  in
       [Singh  and Eind ] where a Union citizen returns to the Member  State
       of which he is a national after  having  resided  in  another  Member
       State in the context of Article 21(1) [TFEU], and as the recipient of
       services within the meaning of Article 56 [TFEU]?
       (2)      If so, is there a requirement that  the  residence  of  the
       Union citizen in another Member State must have  been  of  a  certain
       minimum duration if, after the return of the  Union  citizen  to  the
       Member State of which he is a national, the member of his family  who
       is a third-country national wishes to gain a right  of  residence  in
       that Member State?
       (3)      If so, can that requirement then also be met if there was no
       question of continuous residence, but rather of a  certain  frequency
       of residence, such as during weekly residence at weekends  or  during
       regular visits?

29. Turning first to the opinion of Advocate General Sharpston it is useful
    to consider the opinion insofar as it relates to  defining  "residence"
    at [96] to [111].  In particular what was said at paragraph 100:-

         100. In Swaddling the Court held that the definition of  residence
         in Article 1(h) of  Regulation  No  1408/71 (81)  meant  'habitual
         residence'  and  suggested  that  it  therefore  had   an   EU-wide
         meaning. (82) The Court interpreted the phrase 'the Member State in
         which they reside' as being the place 'where the habitual centre of
         their interests is to be found', which should be determined  taking
         into account 'the employed person's family situation;  the  reasons
         which have led him to  move;  the  length  and  continuity  of  his
         residence; the fact (where it is the case) that  he  is  in  stable
         employment;  and  his  intention  as  it  appears  from   all   the
         circumstances'. (83) In so saying, the Court has indicated that  a
         proper understanding of whether a person is resident or not must be
         based, not on a single factor, but on a collection of elements that
         together enable the  individual's  situation  to  be  assessed  and
         categorised as residence or non-residence.

30. Swaddling [1999] EUECJ C-90/97 it should be recalled,  related  to  the
    restrictions on paying certain social security benefits  to  "a  person
    from abroad", that is somebody who is not habitually  resident  in  the
    United Kingdom.

31. In Swaddling, the Advocate General stated as follows: -


      17. The criterion of the principal or habitual centre of the  worker's
      interests has, moreover, been reaffirmed  in  the  case-law  on  other
      branches of Community law. Merely by way of example, I  would  mention
      the case-law on the European civil service concerning the expatriation
      allowance granted to officials who, by reason of their entry into  the
      service of the Communities, are obliged to move from their country  of
      residence to the country where they are posted. Since the  purpose  of
      that allowance is to alleviate the expense and inconvenience  entailed
      in integrating into a new environment, the (habitual) residence of the
      person concerned prior to entry into service,  that  is  to  say,  the
      place where he had established the permanent centre of his  interests,
      is one of the primary criteria governing recognition of entitlement to
      the allowance. (18) In the quite different area of tax exemption,  the
      Court explained that normal residence - which,  for  the  purposes  of
      Council Directive 83/182/EEC of 28 March 1983 on tax exemptions within
      the Community for certain means of transport temporarily imported into
      one Member State from another, (19)  serves  to  determine  whether  a
      vehicle has been temporarily imported - is the place where the  person
      concerned established the permanent centre of his interests and is  to
      be identified in the light of all the relevant  factual  circumstances
      of the particular case. In Ryborg the Court ruled that the fact  that,
      for more than a year, the person in question  spent  every  night  and
      every weekend in  a  State  other  than  that  of  residence  was  not
      sufficient for  it  to  be  concluded  that  he  had  transferred  the
      permanent centre of his interests to that State.  The  Court  added  -
      significantly in that it affirms the need for a subjective criterion -
      that 'the position would be different if the person concerned  settled
      in Member State B and manifested an intention to live there  with  his
      woman friend and not to return to Member State A'. (20)


      18.  Those examples may come from different areas of  law,  but  they
      show that the references to residence in the various  Community  rules
      cited above share the same conceptual basis, namely the idea that  the
      country of residence is that to which the person concerned has  formed
      a 'social attachment' which is stronger and more stable than any links
      he may have with other Member States.  It  is  a  connection  of  that
      nature which justifies, in the present case, payment  of  the  special
      non-contributory  benefits  referred  to  in  Article   10a   of   the
      regulation, or, given the  fulfilment  of  certain  other  conditions,
      confers entitlement to unemployment benefits on the basis  of  Article
      71, just as, in a different context, it gives a person who enters  the
      service of the Communities a right to the expatriation allowance.

32. In Swaddling the CJEU held at [28] to [29]: -


         28.  Pursuant to Article 1(h) of Regulation No  1408/71,  the  term
         'residence' for the purposes of  that  regulation  'means  habitual
         residence' and therefore has a Community-wide meaning.


         29.  The phrase 'the Member State in which they reside' in  Article
         10a of Regulation No 1408/71 refers  to  the  State  in  which  the
         persons concerned habitually reside and where the  habitual  centre
         of their interests is to be found. In that context, account  should
         be taken in particular of the employed person's  family  situation;
         the reasons which have led him to move; the length  and  continuity
         of his residence; the fact (where this is the case) that he  is  in
         stable employment; and his intention as it  appears  from  all  the
         circumstances   (see,   mutatis   mutandis,   concerning    Article
         71(1)(b)(ii) of Regulation No 1408/71, Case 76/76 Di  Paolo  [1977]
         ECR 315, paragraphs 17 to 20, and Case C-102/91 Knoch [1992] ECR I-
         4341, paragraphs 21 and 23).

33. It is in this context that the Advocate General said in her opinion  in
    O. and B. at [101]:-

         101. In other areas of EU law, the Court has articulated a similar
         understanding of residence: it is where a person has  his  habitual
         or usual centre of interests and it must be determined in light  of
         the facts at issue, which include  both  objective  and  subjective
         elements. (84)




         84 - See, for example, Case 76/76 Di Paolo [1977] ECR 315; Case C-
         102/91 Knoch [1992] ECR I-4341; see also Advocate General  Saggio's
         Opinion in Swaddling, cited in footnote 82  above,  point  17.  See
         also,  for  example,  Case  C-297/89  Ryborg  [1991]  ECR   I-1943,
         paragraphs 24 and 25, and Case C-262/99 Louloudakis [2001]  ECR  I-
         5547, paragraph 55.

34. In the circumstances it is sensible to consider also those cases  given
    that they are cited as examples.  Di Paolo concerns whether an  Italian
    national who last worked in the United Kingdom  and  then  returned  to
    family in Belgium is entitled to employment law benefit in Belgium.  He
    had not worked there.  The court held at [17]

    "The concept of 'the Member State in which he resides' must be  limited
    to the State where the worker,  although  occupied  in  another  Member
    State, continues habitually to reside and where the habitual centre  of
    his interests is also situated."

35. It is also stated at [19 to [22]]:-

       19.    In fact, whenever a worker has a stable employment in a member
             state there is a presumption that he resides there, even if he
             has left his family in another state.

       20.         Accordingly it is not only the family  situation  of  the
             worker that should be taken into account, but also the reasons
             which have led him to move, and the nature of the work.

       21.    The addition of the words 'or who returns to  that  territory'
             implies merely that the concept of residence, such as  defined
             above, does not necessarily exclude non-habitual residence  in
             another member state.

       22.         For the purposes  of  applying  Article  71(1)(b)(ii)  of
             Regulation No 1408/71, account should be taken of  the  length
             and continuity of residence before the person concerned moved,
             the length and purpose of  his  absence,  the  nature  of  the
             occupation found in the other member state and  the  intention
             of  the  person  concerned  as  it  appears   from   all   the
             circumstances."

36. Equally, in Knoch [25]  the  court  noted  that  Miss  Knoch  had  been
    employed for two years as a  university  assistant  in  another  Member
    State under a programme for university exchanges and at the end of  the
    period she became unemployed and her attempts to find work in the State
    proved unsuccessful and that she cannot therefore have been  considered
    to have been in stable employment.  The court held:-

    26.  As regards the fact that she held a post for 21 months in  another
         Member State, it should be borne in mind, as the Court has  already
         indicated in its judgment in Case 76/76 Di Paolo, cited above, that
         there is no precise  definition  of  the  criterion  of  length  of
         absence and that it is not an exclusive criterion.

    27.  Indeed, no provision of Regulation No 1408/71 lays  down  a  time-
         limit beyond which Article 71(1)(b)(ii) must no longer be  applied.
         A contrary interpretation would conflict with the  aim  pursued  by
         that provision, which  is  to  optimize  a  worker'  s  chances  of
         resuming employment.

    28.  Finally, the fact that the worker received  unemployment  benefits
         and sought employment in the other Member State is not  a  decisive
         factor such as to determine that she was resident in that State for
         the purposes of Article 71(1)(b)(ii). At most,  it  indicates  that
         she might have transferred her residence  to  that  State  had  she
         found work there.

    29.  As regards the argument based on the meaning of habitual residence
         under Article 7 of Directive 83/182, it  need  merely  be  observed
         that that is a  definition  peculiar  to  taxation  which  must  be
         interpreted in the light of the aim and  scheme  of  the  Community
         legislation concerned.

37. The High Court considered much of this case law in M v  M  [2007]  EWHC
    2047 (Fam) in which Munby P held at [31] - [33]:
    31. At para [36] Singer J made an important observation with which I
    agree:
         "the European authorities tend to demonstrate, in my judgment, far
         less, if any, emphasis on the ingredients which English law has
         developed that there needs to pass an appreciable time before a
         person can become established as an habitual resident of this
         country."
    He added at para [44] that:
         "although length of time clearly can be a relevant factor it is not
         a conclusive factor. Nor is there any particular period set down as
         a minimum."
    Again, I agree. That approach, in my judgment, and as Singer J
    recognised, is borne out by what the ECJ said in Swaddling v
    Adjudication Officer (Case C-90/97) [1999] ECR 1-01075, [1999] 2 FLR
    184.
    32.  By way of what he called a gloss on the definition of habitual
    residence given in the Borr�s report, Singer J commented at para [38]
    that:
         "it does not have to be permanent. It needs to be habitual. The
         emphasis is on a person's centre of interests. The verb used is
         "established" and all relevant factors are to be taken into
         account. But there is nothing beyond any degree of length of time
         in the words used, except as can be ascribed to the word
         "established". One can establish something very quickly, or it may
         take time to establish. Once a situation is firm it is
         established."
    I respectfully agree. See further L-K v K (No 3) [2006] EWHC 3281
    (Fam), where Singer J gave an autonomous meaning to the word "lodge" in
    Article 16 of the Regulation.
    33.  Accordingly, in my judgment, the phrase "habitually resident" in
    Article 3(1) has the meaning given to that phrase in the decisions of
    the ECJ, a meaning helpfully and accurately encapsulated by Dr Borr�s
    in para [32] of his report:
         "the place where the person had established, on a fixed basis, his
         permanent or habitual centre of interests, with all the relevant
         facts being taken into account for the purpose of determining such
         residence"
    and by the Cour de Cassation in Moore v McLean:
         "the place where the party involved has fixed, with the wish to
         vest it with a stable character, the permanent or habitual centre
         of his or her interests."

38. Munby P also noted [36]

    36 It follows from this, in my judgment, that one has to be careful  in
    this particular context not to read too much into  the  observation  in
    Silvana di Paulo v Office national de l'emploi (Case  76/76)  [1977]  2
    CMLR 59 at para [19], as elsewhere, that there is a presumption that  a
    worker, even if his family is in another Member State, resides  in  the
    Member State where he has stable employment. Qua worker that  no  doubt
    is so. But where the claimant comes before the court not qua worker but
    rather, as here, qua spouse, the presumption carries less weight and is
    more easily rebutted.

39. Returning to O. and B. and the substance of the case, the CJEU answered
    the questions put as follows:-

         39.  Accordingly, Directive 2004/38 establishes a derived right  of
         residence for third-country nationals who are family members  of  a
         Union  citizen,  within  the  meaning  of  Article  2(2)  of   that
         directive, only where that  citizen  has  exercised  his  right  of
         freedom of movement by becoming established in a Member State other
         than the Member State of which he  is  a  national  (see,  to  that
         effect, Metock and Others, paragraph 73; Case C-256/11  Dereci  and
         Others [2011] ECR I-11315, paragraph 56; Iida,  paragraph  51;  and
         Joined Cases C-356/11  and  C-357/11  O.  and  Others  [2012]  ECR,
         paragraph 41).
        45      In that regard, it should be borne in mind that the purpose
       and justification of that derived right of residence is based on  the
       fact that a refusal to allow  such  a  right  would  be  such  as  to
       interfere  with  the  Union  citizen's   freedom   of   movement   by
       discouraging him  from  exercising  his  rights  of  entry  into  and
       residence in the host Member State (see Iida, paragraph  68;  Ymeraga
       and  Ymeraga-Tafarshiku,  paragraph  35;  and  Alokpa   and   Others,
       paragraph 22).
        46      The Court has accordingly held that where a  Union  citizen
       has resided with a family member who is a third-country national in a
       Member State other than the Member State of which he  is  a  national
       for a period exceeding two and a half years and one  and  half  years
       respectively, and was employed  there,  that  third-country  national
       must, when the Union citizen returns to the Member State of which  he
       is a national, be entitled, under Union law, to a  derived  right  of
       residence in the latter State (see Singh,  paragraph  25,  and  Eind,
       paragraph 45). If that third-country national did  not  have  such  a
       right, a worker who is a Union  citizen  could  be  discouraged  from
       leaving the Member State of which he is a national in order to pursue
       gainful employment in another Member  State  simply  because  of  the
       prospect for that worker of not being able to continue, on  returning
       to his Member State of origin, a way of family life  which  may  have
       come into being in the host Member State as a result of  marriage  or
       family reunification (see Eind,  paragraphs  35  and  36,  and  Iida,
       paragraph 70).
        47      Therefore, an obstacle to leaving the Member State of which
       the worker is a national, as mentioned in Singh and Eind, is  created
       by the refusal to confer, when that  worker  returns  to  his  Member
       State of origin, a derived right of residence on the  family  members
       of that worker who are third-country  nationals,  where  that  worker
       resided with his family members in the host Member State pursuant to,
       and in conformity with, Union law.
        49      That is indeed the case. The grant, when  a  Union  citizen
       returns to the Member State of which he is a national, of  a  derived
       right of residence to a third-country national who is a family member
       of that Union citizen and with whom that citizen has resided,  solely
       by virtue of his being a Union citizen, pursuant to and in conformity
       with Union law in the host Member State, seeks  to  remove  the  same
       type of obstacle on leaving  the  Member  State  of  origin  as  that
       referred to in paragraph 47 above, by guaranteeing that that  citizen
       will be able, in his Member State of origin, to continue  the  family
       life which he created or strengthened in the host Member State.
        50      So far as concerns the conditions for granting, when a Union
       citizen returns to the Member State of which  he  is  a  national,  a
       derived right of residence, based on Article 21(1) TFEU, to a third-
       country national who is a family member of that  Union  citizen  with
       whom that citizen has resided, solely by virtue of his being a  Union
       citizen, in the host Member State, those conditions  should  not,  in
       principle, be more  strict  than  those  provided  for  by  Directive
       2004/38 for the grant of such a right of residence to a third-country
       national who is a family member of a Union citizen in  a  case  where
       that citizen has exercised  his  right  of  freedom  of  movement  by
       becoming established in a Member State other than the Member State of
       which he is a national. Even though Directive 2004/38 does not  cover
       such a return, it should be applied by analogy to the conditions  for
       the residence of a Union citizen in a Member State other than that of
       which he is a national, given that in both  cases  it  is  the  Union
       citizen who is the sponsor for  the  grant  of  a  derived  right  of
       residence to a third-country national who is a member of his family.
        51      An obstacle such as that referred to in paragraph 47  above
       will arise only where the residence of the Union citizen in the  host
       Member State has been sufficiently  genuine  so  as  to  enable  that
       citizen to create or strengthen family life  in  that  Member  State.
       [emphasis added].Article 21(1) TFEU does not therefore  require  that
       every  residence  in  the  host  Member  State  by  a  Union  citizen
       accompanied by a  family  member  who  is  a  third-country  national
       necessarily confers a derived  right  of  residence  on  that  family
       member in the Member State of which that citizen is a  national  upon
       the citizen's return to that Member State.

40. The phrase here used is "sufficiently genuine" which militates  against
    a definition of "genuine" in the sense of being the opposite  of  false
    or untrue or for that matter, tainted by dishonesty.  It should also be
    noted that  the  use  of  the  word  "settle"  in  paragraph  52  is  a
    translation of the same word in the French original (s'installer) which
    was in earlier cases translated as "install"  and  does  not  have  the
    connotations of permanence of "settle." It is sufficient  to  note  for
    the purposes of this decision that settle cannot here  mean  settle  in
    the sense meant in domestic law.

41. Regard must also be had to S. and G. [2014] EUECJ  C-457/12  determined
    in parallel with O. and B. In S. and G. the EU nationals were commuting
    to another member state to work, but had continued  to  reside  in  the
    member state of their nationality. Having  concluded  that  the  member
    state of nationality could refuse an application for a residence  cared
    under Directive 2004/38/EC, it held [44] that:

    In the light of the foregoing, Article 45 TFEU must be interpreted  as
    conferring on a third-country national who is the family  member  of  a
    Union citizen a derived right of residence in the Member State of which
    that citizen is a national, where the citizen resides  in  that  Member
    State but regularly travels to another Member State as a worker  within
    the meaning of that provision, if the refusal to grant such a right  of
    residence discourages the worker from effectively exercising his rights
    under Article 45  TFEU,  which  it  is  for  the  referring  court  to
    determine.

42. More recently, in Banger the court held:
    27. However, the Court has acknowledged, in certain cases, that  third-
    country nationals, family members of a  Union  citizen,  who  were  not
    eligible on the basis of Directive  2004/38  for  a  derived  right  of
    residence in the Member State of which  that  citizen  is  a  national,
    could,  nevertheless,  be  accorded  such  a  right  on  the  basis  of
    Article 21(1) TFEU (judgment of 5 June 2018, Coman  and  Others,  C-
    673/16, EU:C:2018:385, paragraph 23).
    28.      That consideration is based upon settled case-law,  according
    to which, in essence, if  no  such  derived  right  of  residence  were
    granted to such a third-country national,  a  Union  citizen  would  be
    discouraged from leaving the Member State of which he is a national  in
    order to exercise his right of residence under Article 21(1)  TFEU  in
    another Member State because he is uncertain whether he will be able to
    continue in his Member State of origin a family  life  which  has  been
    created or strengthened, with that third-country national, in the  host
    Member  State,  during  a  genuine  residence  (see,  to  that  effect,
    judgments of  12 March  2014,  O. and  B.,  C-456/12,  EU:C:2014:135,
    paragraph 54,  and  of  5 June  2018,  Coman  and  Others,  C-673/16,
    EU:C:2018:385, paragraph 24).

43. It is evident from the approach of  the  CJEU  in  O.  and  B.  in  the
    passages cited about  that  its  primary  concern  is  whether  the  EU
    national would be discouraged from leaving his state of nationality  to
    exercise  his  right  of  residence  under  the  Treaty  owing  to   an
    uncertainty over whether he can continue a family life which  has  been
    created or strengthened during a genuine residence. What  is  meant  by
    genuine requires detailed consideration.

44. It must be recalled that the French original of the decisions uses  the
    word "effectif"  to  qualify  residence.  "Effectif",  translated  into
    English as "genuine"  in  the  more  recent  decisions  (earlier  cases
    translate that as "effective"), does not imply the  opposite  of  false
    unlike the ordinary English usage word "genuine".   What it  does  mean
    is that there must be substance to the residence as is indicated in the
    opinion of the A-G in O. and B. That is mirrored in the CJEU's decision
    at [51].

45. The CJEU did not in O. and B. seek to lay down  specific  criteria  for
    assessing what factors should be taken into account  in  assessing  the
    quality of the residence over and above noting that the initial  three-
    month period permitted  by  the  Citizenship  Directive  would  not  be
    sufficient and observing at  [51]  that  the  residence  of  the  Union
    citizen in the host Member State has been sufficiently genuine so as to
    enable that citizen to create or strengthen family life in that  Member
    State.  That  implies  a  fact-sensitive  approach  to  be  applied  in
    individual cases and that there must be some substance to it;  it  does
    not, however imply any particular factors to be taken into account, nor
    does it suggest that intentions are relevant.

46. Some assistance in assessing what is genuine  can  be  drawn  from  the
    other cases, but subject to the caveat that as Munby P noted in M v M ,
    there is a distinction drawn between residence for work and benefits on
    the one hand, and tax liability on the other.

47. Where the jurisprudence of the Court of  Justice  refers  to  residence
    being "genuine", it does not import with  it  a  consideration  of  the
    motives behind that residence in the abuse of rights sense.  Rather, it
    is a  qualitative  evaluation  of  the  residence  which  needs  to  be
    undertaken.  It is in that sense that the intentions  are  relevant  in
    the sense of what it was that the  individuals  who  moved  to  another
    member state intended to do?  Did  they  intend  properly  to  exercise
    Treaty rights or was it, for example, simply an extended holiday or was
    it a fixed-term employment of short duration where the person concerned
    retained an official address with her parents as in Knoch?

48. Further support for "genuine" in Regulation 9.3 to  "genuine"  being  a
    qualitative analysis is that if it were to import the issue of whether,
    on the contrary, it was an abuse  of  rights  as  being  an  artificial
    creation, then there would be little or no purpose to Regulation 9(4).

49. Properly understood in the context of the case law  set  out  above  in
    assessing whether the residence was genuine, this must be done  through
    the lens of the case law and it follows from the list of factors  being
    non-exhaustive that none of them are determinative nor should  they  be
    read as a checklist of requirements; the absence of  one  factor  being
    established does not necessarily mean that there has not been a genuine
    residence.

50. While the Court of Session in AA (Nigeria) placed significant  reliance
    on the issue of establishment at [48] to [51], it  is  to  be  recalled
    that the word used in the French original is "s'installer",  which,  as
    with the concept of habitual residence does not import a long  duration
    of time. As noted above, it has also been translated as "settle"  which
    cannot bear the technical meaning given to it in  domestic  immigration
    law. Rather, it is simply an indicator of some degree of permanence  as
    does the phrase "habitual resident". Although that  is  defined  in  EU
    law, it is not used in the case law except to illustrate  the  type  of
    considerations to be undertaken in evaluating residence.

    The "centre of life" test

51. I turn next to the issue of the transfer of an individual's  centre  of
    life which is a key concept within reg.9.

52. The phrase "centre of life" does not occur in the case law. It is not a
    term of art, nor is it defined in European  Law.   In  A-G  Sharpston's
    opinion in O. and B. at [100] to [101] she refers to "habitual or usual
    centre of interests" but that must be seen in context of what she wrote
    at [99]:

    In the context of EU citizenship law, residence in another Member State
    is, apart from being a right,  sometimes  a  condition  for  exercising
    ancillary rights attached to that status (for  example,  the  right  to
    vote and  to  stand  as  a  candidate  in  elections  to  the  European
    Parliament and in municipal elections, but it can also be a requirement
    that restricts other freedoms guaranteed under EU law.

53. The context here where  it  is  necessary  to  identify  one  place  of
    residence from which other rights flow, be that a right to vote of , in
    the cases where an EU civil servant's relocation  expenses,  the  place
    from which he moved. In the latter, the case law appears to  flow  from
    the requirement in Germany and Austria to have an official,  registered
    address.

54. It is not the case that in other contexts it is  necessary  to  have  a
    sole residence. As A- G Sharpston wrote:
    103. Nor do I think that whether an EU citizen has taken up residence
    in another Member State turns on whether that is his sole place of
    residence. In many cases, exercise of the right to reside freely in the
    European Union will involve moving residence from one Member State to
    another, without keeping any meaningful connection with the former
    place of residence. In other cases, however, it will be expedient for
    various reasons to maintain significant ties.
    104. Provided that EU citizens satisfy the test for establishing
    residence in a Member State, it should not matter that they might keep
    some form of residence elsewhere. There is no general rule of EU law
    whereby residence in one Member State precludes concurrent residence in
    another Member State.  That appears to be implied also by the
    provisions of Directive 2004/38 which make residence of longer than
    three months dependent on the condition that an EU citizen either is a
    worker or a self-employed person or has sufficient resources available
    in order to avoid becoming a burden on the social assistance system of
    the host Member State. By contrast, full solidarity (when the
    'sufficient resources' condition no longer applies) must be shown to
    permanent residents.

55. The A-G's opinion does not form part of the judgment of the  CJEU,  but
    it is grounded in the case law of the CJEU as  can  be  seen  from  the
    footnotes to the passages cited. There is nothing in  the  decision  to
    contradict the A-G's opinion and it is of note that at [103] and [104],
    there  is  a  strong  indication  that  there  is  no  need  to  reside
    exclusively in the host member state.

56. There is nothing in the case of law of  the  CJEU  to  contradict  this
    summary of the law or to show that in order to  generate  a  derivative
    right that an individual must have moved his centre of life;  or,  even
    if that were so, that that requires  him  to  have  ceased  to  have  a
    residence in his home state; or to have integrated  to  any  particular
    degree.

57. There is some indication of a European provenance  for  the  centre  of
    life test. Rosa v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 14 at [20] refers to non-binding
    guidance issued by the European Commission on the Directive (COM (2009)
    313 Final, 2 June 2009) which at [4] provides:

         There is no abuse where EU citizens and their family members obtain
         a right of residence under Community law in a  Member  State  other
         than that of the EU citizen's nationality as  they  are  benefiting
         from an advantage inherent in the exercise of  the  right  of  free
         movement protected by the Treaty,  regardless  of  the  purpose  of
         their move to that State. By the same token, Community law protects
         EU citizens who return  home  after  having  exercised  their  free
         movement rights.

         ...

         When necessary, Member  States  may  define  a  set  of  indicative
         criteria to assess      whether residence in the host Member  State
         was genuine and effective. National authorities may  in  particular
         take into account the following factors.

58. This appears to be the origin of the tests in reg.  9  b.  The  Factors
    cited are:

       . the circumstances under which the EU citizen concerned moved to the
         host  Member  State  (previous  unsuccessful  attempts  to  acquire
         residence for a third country spouse under national law, job  offer
         in the host Member State, capacity in which the EU citizen  resides
         in the host Member State);




       .  degree of effectiveness and genuineness of residence in  the  host
         Member State (envisaged and actual residence  in  the  host  Member
         State,  efforts  made  to  establish  in  the  host  Member  State,
         including   national   registration   formalities   and    securing
         accommodation, enrolling children at an educational establishment);




       . circumstances under which the EU citizen concerned moved back  home
         (return immediately after marrying  a  third  country  national  in
         another Member State).

59. But the guidance also says:

         It cannot be inferred that the residence in the host  Member  State
         is not genuine and effective only because an EU  citizen  maintains
         some ties to the home Member State, all the more if his  status  in
         the host country is unstable  (e.g.  a  work  contract  of  limited
         duration). The mere fact that a person consciously  places  himself
         in a situation conferring a right does not in itself  constitute  a
         sufficient basis for assuming that there is abuse.



60. It must, however, be borne in mind that the guidance is non-binding; it
    is not an EU Treaty nor is it a distillation of established case law or
    doctrine.


    Reg 9 (4)

61. It is to be recalled that restrictions on the rights of free  movement,
    derived or otherwise, are to be narrowly  construed  as  the  Court  of
    Justice has made clear.  They may be  restrained  on  limited  grounds,
    including where there is abuse of rights or fraud.

62. Turning to the issue of abuse of rights, as was noted in R (Gureckis) v
    SSHD [2017] EWHC 3298 at [77]

    77. The leading case on abuse of rights under EU law is Case C-110/99
    Emsland-Sta�rke GmbH v Hauptzollamt Hamburg-Jonas [2000] ECR I-11569.
    In Emsland-St�rke the CJEU, having reviewed the earlier case law,
    propounded the following test for establishing an abuse of rights:
         "52. A finding of  an  abuse  requires,  first,  a  combination  of
         objective circumstances in which, despite formal observance of  the
         conditions laid down by the Community rules, the purpose  of  those
         rules has not been achieved.


         53. It requires, second, a subjective  element  consisting  in  the
         intention to obtain  an  advantage  from  the  Community  rules  by
         creating artificially the conditions laid down  for  obtaining  it.
         The existence of that subjective element can be established,  inter
         alia, by evidence  of  collusion  between  the  Community  exporter
         receiving the refunds and the importer of the  goods  in  the  non-
         member country."

63. This is further considered at [83] to [86]:


    83. The abuse of rights principle only applies where a person meets the
    conditions laid down for the enjoyment of the  right  in  question.  In
    Case C-413/01 Franca Ninni-Orasche v Bundesminister  f�r  Wissenschaft,
    Verkehr und Kunst [2003] ECR I-13187, the ECJ had to consider whether a
    person's application for study finance was an  abuse  because  she  had
    only worked for a short period in the  host  State  before  making  the
    application. The ECJ held, at [31]:


           "31. Finally, as regards the argument that the national court is
           under an obligation to examine .... whether  the  appellant  has
           sought abusively to create a situation enabling her to claim the
           status of a worker within the  meaning  of  Article  48  of  the
           Treaty with the aim  of  acquiring  advantages  linked  to  that
           status, it is sufficient to state that any abusive  use  of  the
           rights granted by the Community legal order under the provisions
           relating to freedom of movement for workers presupposes that the
           person concerned falls within the scope ratione personae of that
           Treaty because he satisfies the conditions for classification as
           a 'worker' within the meaning of that article. It  follows  that
           the issue of abuse of rights can have no bearing on  the  answer
           to the first question."


    84.  The ECJ has held that abuse of rights will arise  only  where  the
         conduct is engaged in solely for  the  purpose  of  satisfying  the
         criteria necessary to access the benefit.  In  Case  39/86  Lair  v
         Universit�t Hannover [1988] ECR 3161, the Court said at [43]:
           "43. In so far as the arguments submitted by  the  three  Member
           States in question are motivated by a desire to prevent  certain
           abuses, for example where it may be established on the basis  of
           objective evidence that a worker has entered a Member State  for
           the sole purpose of enjoying,  after  a  very  short  period  of
           occupational activity, the benefit  of  the  student  assistance
           system in that State, it should be observed that such abuses are
           not covered by the Community provisions in question."


    85.  Recital (28) of the Directive also refers to sole purpose:


           "To guard against abuse of rights or fraud, notably marriages of
           convenience or any other form of  relationships  contracted  for
           the sole purpose of enjoying the  right  of  free  movement  and
           residence, Member States should have the  possibility  to  adopt
           the necessary measures."



    86.  The paradigm of an abuse of rights in the context of the Directive
         is a "marriage of convenience", as identified in Article 35. Whilst
         married partners might formally comply with the relevant conditions
         in the Directive to benefit from rights of movement and  residence,
         the compliance has been created in an  artificial  way  by  a  sham
         marriage in order to obtain the rights conferred by the  Directive.
         However, even in the context of  a  marriage  of  convenience,  the
         Supreme Court emphasised in Sadovska v Secretary of State  for  the
         Home Department [2017] UKSC 54 that the predominant purpose of  the
         marriage of convenience must be artificially to gain EU law  rights
         and that this must be the purpose of both partners to the marriage.

64. It is of note that in Sadovska  the  Supreme  Court  simply  relied  on
    guidance documents and did not address any of the CJEU's  case  law  on
    abuse of rights. Further, it is to be noted  that  the  material  cited
    relates to marriages of convenience which is not the case here.

65. In Cadbury-Schweppes v Commissioners of Inland Revenue [2006] EUECJ  C-
    196/04, a UK company set up subsidiaries in Ireland in order  to  raise
    and provide funds to companies within the group, ostensibly to  benefit
    from the lower rate of corporation tax  in  Ireland.  HMRC  applied  UK
    legislation to charge tax on the Irish companies, to which the  company
    objected as being contrary to the freedom of  establishment  under  the
    TREU. The ECJ held that  where  there  had  been  no  genuine  economic
    activity in Ireland  such  that  subsidiaries  in  Ireland  represented
    'wholly artificial arrangements   there would have been  no  fulfilment
    of the purpose of the freedom to establish  businesses- the  assistance
    of economic and social interpenetration within the EU. What is  notable
    is that that the sole purpose of the legal act of establishment must be
    to improperly obtain the relevant advantage

66. In cases such as this there are two stages in which EU law is  engaged.
    There is first the exercise of Treaty rights in another  member  state,
    in this case Ireland, analogous to the  establishment  of  a  business.
    The second stage of the process arises when a person who  has  done  so
    returns to his home member state.

67. In a marriage of convenience, once the parties  are  lawfully  married,
    the non-EEA partner obtains a large bundle of rights not only the right
    of residence, but to work, to set up in business and in some  cases  to
    obtain social support. Other procedural  rights  accrue  also.   But  a
    legal relationship or status, marriage, has been brought into being for
    no purpose other than to secure those  rights  which  accrete  to  that
    status. It is where the gaining of  those  rights  is  the  predominant
    purpose that it becomes abusive.

68. In contrast, where an EEA national goes to  another  member  state  and
    takes employment, he undertakes work for pay. Taxes are paid,  and  the
    right of residence necessary to do all of that is  exercised.   As  the
    case law makes clear, the intentions of a person taking  work  are  not
    relevant; such a system whereby a host  state  would  have  to  examine
    motives would be contrary to the Directive.

69.  If,  however,  an  entirely  artificial  step  in  the  process   were
    introduced, such as a British Citizen working notionally for  an  Irish
    company but posted to work exclusively in the United Kingdom (analogous
    to the position in Cadbury- Schweppes) it might be different.

70. In summary, the doctrine of abuse of rights can apply only where it  is
    shown by  the  respondent  that  there  was  no  genuine  (as  properly
    construed) exercise of the Treaty right  to  free  movement  and  where
    there was an intention to use an  artificial  constructed  arrangement.
    Both elements have to be demonstrated by the respondent.

    Interpreting the Regulations

71. I turn now as to how the regulations are to be interpreted. In  British
    Gas Trading Ltd v Lock and Anor [2016] 1 CMLR 25 the  Court  of  Appeal
    reviewed the case law on 'conforming interpretation' of  EU  and  human
    rights law and considered the core principles  outlined  in  Marleasing
    S.A v LA Commercial Internacional de Alimentacion S.A.  [1992]  1  CMLR
    305, Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza [2004] UKHL 30, Vodafone 2 v  Revenue  and
    Customs Commissioners [2009] EWCA Civ 446 and Swift (trading as A Swift
    Move) v Robertson [2014] 1 WLFR 3438.


72. In Vodafone  2  the  Court  of  Appeal  approved  the  summary  of  the
    principles of conforming interpretation prepared  by  counsel  for  the
    HMRC.


    "37.  ...
    "In summary, the obligation on the English courts to construe domestic
    legislation consistently with Community law obligations is both broad
    and far-reaching. In particular: (a) it is not constrained by
    conventional rules of construction (per Lord Oliver of Aylmerton in the
    Pickstone case, at p. 126B); it does not require ambiguity in the
    legislative language (per Lord Oliver in the Pickstone case, at p. 126B
    and Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in Ghaidan's case, at para 32); (c) it
    is not an exercise in semantics or linguistics (per Lord Nicholls in
    Ghaidan's case, at paras 31 and 35; per Lord Steyn, at paras 48-49; per
    Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, at paras 110-115); (d) it permits departure
    from the strict and literal application of the words which the
    legislature has elected to use (per Lord Oliver in the Litster case, at
    p 577A; per Lord Nicholls in Ghaidan's case, at para 31); (e) it
    permits the implication of words necessary to comply with Community law
    obligations (per Lord Templeman in the Pickstone case, at pp 120H-121A;
    per Lord Oliver in the Litster case, at p 577A); and (f) the precise
    form of the words to be implied does not matter (per Lord Keith of
    Kinkel in the Pickstone case, at p 112D; per Lord Rodger in Ghaidan's
    case, at para 122; per Arden LJ in the IDT Card Services case, at para
    114)
    ......
    "The only constraints on the broad and far-reaching nature of the
    interpretative obligation are that: (a) the meaning should 'go with the
    grain of the legislation' and be compatible with the underlying thrust
    of the legislation being construed': see per Lord Nicholls in Ghaidan
    v. Godin-Medoza [2004] 2 AC 557, para 53; Dyson LJ in Revenue and
    Customs v. EB Central Services Ltd [2008] STC 2209, para 81. An
    interpretation should not be adopted which is inconsistent with a
    fundamental or cardinal feature of the legislation since this would
    cross the boundary between interpretation and amendment (see per Lord
    Nicholls, at para 33, Lord Rodger, at paras 110-113 in Ghaidan's case;
    per Arden LJ in R (IDT Card Services Ireland Ltd) v. Customs and Excise
    Comrs [2006] STC 1252, paras 82 and 113); and (b) the exercise of the
    interpretative obligation cannot require the courts to make decisions
    for which they are not equipped or give rise to important practical
    repercussions which the court is not equipped to evaluate: see the
    Ghaidan case, per Lord Nicholls, at para 33; per Lord Rodger, at para
    115; per Arden LJ in the IDT Card Services case, at para 113.'"

73. It follows that in the case of reg. 9(3), the factors  identified  need
    to be read in the light of the case law  of  the  CJEU.  Little  or  no
    weight need be attached to those factors which are not supported by  EU
    law and the regulation must be read applying properly what is meant  by
    "genuine".

74. In the case of reg. 9 (4) (a), this must be interpreted as it being for
    the Secretary of State to establish that there has  been  an  abuse  of
    rights as established under EU law. Further, and in any event, even  if
    I am wrong on this issue, the sole ground of appeal here  is  that  the
    decision of the respondent was in breach of the  rights  under  the  EU
    Treaties, not the 2016 Regulations.

75. To summarise the position in European law under the EU treaties:

      i) Where an EU national of one state ("the  home  member  state")  has
         exercised the right of freedom of movement to take up work or self-
         employment in another EU state ("the host  state")  ,  his  or  her
         family members have a derivative right to enter the member state if
         the exercise of Treaty rights in the host state was genuine;

     ii) "genuine" must be interpreted  in  the  sense  that  it  was  real,
         substantive, or effective;

    iii) An analysis of "genuine" residence cannot involve the consideration
         of the motives of the persons who moved except in the limited sense
         of what they intended to in the host member state

     iv) Whether family life was established and/or strengthened, requires a
         qualitative assessment which will be fact-specific; the  burden  of
         doing so lies on the appellant;

      v) There must in fact have been an exercise of Treaty rights; any work
         or self-employment must have been "genuine and effective"  and  not
         marginal or ancillary;

     vi) The assessment of whether a stay in the host state was genuine does
         not involve an assessment of the intentions of the parties over and
         above a consideration of whether what they intended to  do  was  in
         fact to exercise Treaty rights;

    vii) There is no requirement for the EU national or his family  to  have
         integrated into the host member state, nor for the  sole  place  of
         residence to be in the host state; there is no requirement to  have
         severed ties with the home member state; albeit that these  factors
         may, to a limited degree, be relevant to the qualitative assessment
         of whether the exercise of Treaty rights was genuine;

   viii) The requirement to have transferred the centre of one's life to the
         host member state is not  a  requirement  of  EU  law,  nor  is  it
         endorsed by the CJEU;

     ix) If it is alleged that the stay in the host member  state  was  such
         that reg. 9 (4) applies, the burden is on the Secretary of State to
         show that there was an abuse of rights;

    The decision under challenge

76. Having reached these conclusions as to the applicable law, I turn  next
    to whether the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making
    of an error of law

77. It is evident that the judge directed himself properly at [24] and that
    he undertook an evaluation of all of the evidence  concluding  that  in
    all the circumstances of the case, which included a fair evaluation  on
    the lack of credibility of evidence. Whilst evaluating the  quality  of
    the residence in Ireland and noting [34] that it was for  a  period  of
    around a year and was capable of potentially tipping the  balance,  the
    judge has erred in that at several points, most clearly at  [32],  that
    he has conflated the issue of a qualitative  nature  of  the  residence
    with motivations to an extent which is not permissible.  Those  factors
    may well have been relevant to an assessment under Regulation 9(4)  but
    it is the Secretary of State who bears the burden of proof  in  respect
    of such an allegation.

78. For these reasons I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    as it involved the making of an error of  law,  the  judge  effectively
    interpreting Regulation 9(3) and 9(4) in such a way as to  reverse  the
    burden of proof with regard to an abuse of rights.

79. Owing to a number of administrative  problems,  including  difficulties
    due to interpreters not being booked, it was not  possible  to  proceed
    with the adjourned hearing until 22 May  2019.  By  then,  owing  to  a
    deterioration in his health and  incipient  dementia,  the  appellant's
    husband was not able to give reliable evidence and he did not do so.

    Remaking the decision

80. I heard evidence from the appellant as well as from MA.

81. The appellant adopted her witness statements  and  was  cross-examined.
    She said that she and her husband  had  not  discussed  them  going  to
    Ireland before they did so and at the time he had no health issues  and
    was "very well".  She said he had not told  her  that  he  had  felt  a
    little stressed by living in London.

82. The appellant said that when  they  arrived  in  Limerick  people  were
    friendly and at supermarkets and shops nearby.  She said they lived  in
    a one bedroomed property which had a sitting room and  they  were  very
    happy there.  She said her husband's working hours were flexible and he
    worked three, four sometimes five hours a day.

83. Asked what happened to her when her  husband  had  lost  his  job,  and
    whether he tried to find out if he could get benefits in  Ireland,  the
    appellant said they could not find anyone to help to get benefits;  she
    had no information as to what she was entitled to receive and that they
    had asked.  She said she did not know if he had  asked  anyone  at  the
    mosque if they could help.  She then  said  that  they  had  not  asked
    people about benefits out of shame about the fact that her husband  was
    no longer in employment.  She said they did ask people, a  couple,  but
    not their friends.

84. The appellant said her husband did try to find jobs through the mosque,
    but people were at best only able to point him to where he  might  find
    employment rather than to find him a job.  The appellant said also what
    flow from her having a PPS number she said that she was told she needed
    to get one.  She said that the place where they had obtained the number
    was not able to help them.  She said that they had been happy and  they
    would have been if there had been no financial problems which is  where
    their problems started.  Then she said that returning to  England,  she
    did not know that she would have faced this sort of problem.

85. In response to my questions, the appellant said that  her  husband  had
    had diabetes, but this had been stable whilst they were in Ireland.

86. I then heard from MA who adopted his  witness  statements.   In  cross-
    examination MA said the appellant's husband was OK at the time and  was
    in very good health.  He said  there  were  no  visible  signs  of  the
    appellant's husband not being well.  He said that he did  not  know  if
    the appellant's husband had been entitled to benefits  in  Ireland  but
    that he had been told that he paid tax.  He said that he had  told  him
    that he should call his old boss.

87. He said that in his experience people at the mosque did help each other
    out.

88. The witness said that he  did  know  a  Mr  Stockman  (the  appellant's
    husband's landlord).  He did not know how many properties he owns.

89. In submissions, Ms Holmes submitted, relying  on  the  refusal  letter,
    that the appellant's time spent in Ireland was  not  genuine  and  that
    Regulation 9(3) had not been met.  She  submitted  that  in  this  case
    there had been no real transfer of the centre of  life  nor  had  there
    been any real degree of integration beyond the community mosque and the
    Islamic community  within  Limerick.   She  did,  however,  accept  the
    children had been attending school in Ireland.

90. Ms Holmes submitted that there had  in  this  case  been  a  degree  of
    obfuscation about the issue of benefits, it being  somewhat  surprising
    if the people in the mosque were helpful  that  they  would  have  been
    unable to assist.

91. Ms Kiai submitted that there had been a genuine residence  in  Ireland.
    She submitted that the context of this case was  the  sponsor  was  not
    educated nor was her husband who had been the  sole  breadwinner.   She
    submitted in that  context  their  actions  in  not  seeking  to  claim
    benefits in Ireland but a return to the United  Kingdom  was  sensible.
    She submitted in this case that the family had properly integrated into
    life in Ireland and that the Secretary of  State  had  not  shown  that
    Regulation 9(4) was met.

Findings

92. I draw no inferences adverse to the appellant or, for that matter,  her
    husband, from the fact that he did not give evidence before me.  It  is
    apparent from the most recent medical reports  that  he  has  begun  to
    suffer significantly from memory impairment as a result of dementia.  I
    am satisfied that in the circumstances, it was sensible not to call him
    to give evidence and that it would in consequence of his illness,  have
    been difficult to attach much weight to his evidence in the sense  that
    he would not have been reliable.  That does not mean that  I  find  his
    credibility is impaired.

93. I do, however, have some doubts about the account given to  me  of  the
    appellant's husband being in good health when he went to  Ireland.   It
    is evident from the medical records that he was by that  point  already
    suffering from diabetes and a number of other complaints.  While  there
    is nothing to contradict the  evidence  that  his  diabetes  was  under
    control, nonetheless they consider the evidence of both witnesses  whom
    I heard but perhaps putting too favourable a gloss on his condition.

94. Similarly, I found the evidence regarding why no assistance was  sought
    in finding out if they could acquire or obtain benefits was  contrived.
    I can understand that somebody may not, out of shame  and  a  sense  of
    pride, wish to state that they needed to claim benefits.  But  it  must
    have been known that the appellant's husband was looking for a  job  as
    he was asking for  assistance  with  this.   Further,  the  appellant's
    evidence on this issue is a little confused.  That she said firstly she
    did not know how to go about to find out; but nobody was able  to  tell
    them; but, they had not asked anybody in the  mosque.   She  then  said
    that they asked people who were not friends.  This is not  coherent  or
    consistent.

95. This does not, however, in my view impact on whether and for  how  long
    the couple lived in Ireland or that they had been accompanied by  their
    children.

96. That said, I bear in mind  the  observations  made  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  There is a lack  of  evidence  as  to  why  the  appellant's
    husband had decided to go to Ireland.  On the evidence before me he had
    not discussed it with his wife and given his age, lack  of  skills  and
    lack of communication, it is surprising that a decision  was  taken  at
    such short notice with such little discussion.  I accept in  this  case
    there was residence of approximately a year and they  lived  in  rented
    accommodation.  This is not a case in which, for example, accommodation
    was maintained in the United Kingdom, for example how she was  let  out
    or no longer occupied and, viewing the evidence as a whole, I  consider
    that the residence was genuine in the sense that what was intended  was
    achieved;  that  is,  the  exercise  of  treaty  rights   whereby   the
    appellant's husband worked but that they then returned  to  the  United
    Kingdom when he lost employment.  There is sufficient evidence to  show
    employment and the renting of accommodation.

97. Whilst there is significant evidence as documented  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal indicating that the motivation in so doing was  to  circumvent
    the Immigration Rules, it is not such which can be taken  into  account
    assessing whether the residence and exercise of treaty  rights  was  in
    fact genuine in the proper sense.

98. Accordingly, I am satisfied that Regulation 9.3 was met in this case.

99. It is of course for the Secretary of State to show that there has  been
    an abuse of rights.  This does, however appear to have been confused in
    the refusal letter, the Secretary of State observing  on  the  evidence
    that it did not appear  that  the  appellant's  husband  had  genuinely
    transferred the centre of his life to Ireland and that the  purpose  of
    the stay in Ireland was really to allow him to exercise  treaty  rights
    there so that there could then be an application for a  residence  card
    under the EEA Regulations under  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  letter
    states expressly:

         "It is not accepted that you and  your  British  citizen  sponsor's
         residence in the EEA host country was genuine and it is  considered
         that the purpose of residence in the EEA  host  country  was  as  a
         means for circumventing the  UK's  domestic  Immigration  Rules  or
         other immigration law."

100. This is not a sufficient basis to show that this amounted to  an  abuse
    of rights.  Accordingly, I am not satisfied that reg 9 (4) is made out.



101. For these reasons, I allow the appeal.

Notice of decision

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and I set it aside.

 2. I remake the decision by allowing  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
