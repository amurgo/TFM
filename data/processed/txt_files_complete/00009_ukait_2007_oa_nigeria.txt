                            THE IMMIGRATION ACTS

Heard at Field House                            Determination sent to

On 10 January 2007

                                                                   Appellant

                                     and

               The Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent



If  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  disregards  the  plain  (and   repeated)
direction of the Tribunal  to  serve  and  file  Explanatory  Statement  and
supporting documents in time for the hearing, then he must take  the  chance
of the Tribunal not understanding his reasoning  processes  and  disagreeing
with  his  assessment  of  the  credibility  of  the  appellant.   Where  an
Immigration  Judge  is  faced  with  a  party's  failure  to   comply   with
directions, his first question must be whether he  has  sufficient  material
before him to enable him  to  determine  the  appeal,  notwithstanding  this
failure.

The absence of the respondent's documents, as in this appeal, which  was  on
the papers causes particular difficulties in assessing whether the  decision
reached by the Entry Clearance Officer is sustainable in law, but  documents
submitted  by  the  non-defaulting  party  may  enable  the  appeal  to   be
determined.  Whether that is so in any particular appeal is a  question  for
the Immigration Judge hearing the appeal.

Where  documents  filed  by  an  appellant  were  apparently   genuine   and
sufficient to sustain his claim, even though (unbeknown to  the  Immigration
Judge) the Entry Clearance Officer had received evidence that some of  those
documents were forged, it is  difficult  to  see  how  the  Entry  Clearance
Officer could properly complain of a positive  credibility  finding  by  the
Immigration Judge on the material which was before him.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This is the reconsideration, with permission granted  to  the  appellant,
   of the determination of Immigration Judge Reid, who dismissed his  appeal
   against the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer to refuse  him  entry
   clearance to study on a Financial Management course at the University  of
   Hull, at his father's expense.  The appeal  fell  to  be  assessed  under
   paragraph 57 of HC 395 (as amended).   The  appellant  is  a  citizen  of
   Nigeria.

2. The Immigration Judge  noted  that  the  appellant,  who  has  no  United
   Kingdom sponsor, wished the appeal to be decided  on  the  basis  of  the
   information on file.  This is one of the many appeals recently where  the
   Entry Clearance Officer documents were not before the  Immigration  Judge
   in time for the hearing, despite two directions to file and  serve  them.
   I shall set out the documents which were before  the  Immigration  Judge,
   and then assess the significance of the missing documents.

3. The Immigration Judge summarised the grounds for refusal  as  being  that
   the Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that  the  appellant  could
   meet the costs  of  the  course  without  recourse  to  public  funds  or
   employment as the documents produced by the appellant in relation to  his
   father's finances related to a limited company, not an  individual.   She
   noted that the respondent had failed to provide the application  form  or
   the documents originally submitted by the appellant, which she considered
   'less than satisfactory'.

4.  The  grounds  of  appeal  principally  challenged  the  Entry  Clearance
   Officer's assessment that the financial documents submitted in support of
   the application referred to a limited company with five signatories.  The
   company sponsoring the appellant bears his  family  surname.  It  was  in
   fact, said the grounds of appeal, solely owned by the appellant's father,
   who was the sole signatory of the company's current account.  The grounds
   stated that the appellant had  attached  the  father's  personal  current
   account number with  the  same  bankers,  and  a  letter  from  the  bank
   confirming that the appellant's father was the sole signatory both on his
   personal and business accounts.

5. The Immigration Judge set  out  paragraphs  57  and  58  of  HC  395  (as
   amended) and reminded herself  that  the  burden  of  proof  was  on  the
   appellant, to the standard of balance of  probabilities.  She  took  into
   account the documents provided by the appellant, which were all that  she
   had to go on, and in particular,  a  letter  he  had  obtained  from  his
   father's bankers, Guaranty Trust Bank plc ('Guaranty  Trust')  confirming
   that his father was sole signatory to a particular account  number.   She
   was unimpressed by that:  the letter was misspelled and ungrammatical and
   failed to name the company concerned.  Guaranty Trust bank statements for
   that account were poor quality photocopies.

The Immigration Decision

6. Fortunately, the appellant had supplied with  his  grounds  of  appeal  a
   copy of the Notice of Immigration Decision  giving  the  Entry  Clearance
   Officer's reasons for refusing him entry clearance.  The Entry  Clearance
   Officer's decision notice of 16 August 2006 stated -

      "You have applied for entry clearance to enable you to  study  in  the
      United Kingdom and  have  completed  an  additional  questionnaire  to
      assist your application.  I have carefully considered your application
      on  the  basis  of  your  passport,  application  form,  supplementary
      questionnaire and the papers you have  provided.   You  have  declared
      that the information you have given is complete and true to  the  best
      of your knowledge.
      However, I am not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that you
      meet the requirements of paragraph 57, and in  particular:   that  you
      are able to meet the costs of the course and maintain and  accommodate
      yourself without recourse to public funds or taking employment

      BECAUSE
      The cost of your tuition, maintenance and accommodation is to be borne
      by your father. However, the financial documents  you  have  submitted
      refer to a limited company.  I note that there are five signatories to
      this company account.  There is  nothing  to  suggest  that  you  have
      access to these funds to pay for your proposed trip. In the absence of
      any other evidence of your sponsor's business, income, or  the  origin
      of these funds, I am not satisfied that the evidence  presented  is  a
      true reflection of your  sponsor's  financial  circumstances  or  that
      these funds would be available.  This ultimately leads me to doubt you
      have the funds to pay for  your  course  or  adequately  maintain  and
      accommodate yourself in the United Kingdom without recourse to  public
      funds or taking employment.
      Furthermore, the educational establishment in the United  Kingdom  has
      stated that the cost of your tuition  fees  for  one  year  is  �7950.
      British Council guidelines suggest students require between �7800  and
      �9700 per annum for maintenance and  living  expenses  in  the  United
      Kingdom. This brings the total cost of  your  studies  in  the  United
      Kingdom for one year to �17000.  Your sponsor's financial documents do
      not satisfactorily confirm that you have sufficient funds to cover the
      cost of your studies in the United Kingdom and adequately maintain and
      accommodate yourself whilst there.
      Therefore I am not  satisfied  that  this  represents  a  genuine  and
      meaningful offer of sponsorships and that these  funds  would  be  but
      [sic] question your motivation for undertaking  this  course  at  this
      time.
      I therefore refuse your application."

7. The notice indicated that the appellant's completed  appeal  form  should
   not arrive later than 28 days after the date of decision.  The  appellant
   appealed promptly, five days later, on  21  August  2005,  enclosing  the
   documents already set out.

Directions to the Entry Clearance Officer

8. On 7 November 2005, the respondent was served with a copy of  the  Notice
   of Appeal by the Tribunal, and directed to file:  a copy of the notice of
   decision to which the notice of appeal relates, and  any  other  document
   giving reasons for that decision, together  with  any  application  form,
   record of interview or any other unpublished  document  which  is  relied
   upon by the respondent. The respondent was also required to serve all  of
   these documents on the appellant, with the exception  of  any  which  had
   already been sent to the appellant.  The respondent did not comply.

9. On 6 February 2006, the respondent was again directed under  rule  13  of
   the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 to  file  with
   the Tribunal 'copy of the documents  specified  within  the  rule'.   The
   documents, the notice states, should have been filed not  later  than  23
   January 2006 and were already  late.   The  respondent  was  required  to
   supply the documents 'without further delay' and to  serve  them  on  the
   appellant, unless they had already  been  sent  to  the  appellant.   The
   notice continues -

      "Please note that under 51(4), the  Tribunal  must  not  consider  any
      written evidence which is not  filed  in  accordance  with  directions
      unless it is satisfied that there is good reason to do so.
      This appeal has now been listed for a substantive hearing on  3  April
      2006.  If the specific documents are not filed  with  the  Tribunal  5
      working days before the date of this hearing, subject to  rule  51(4),
      the appeal may be determined in the absence of these documents."

The determination

10. The Immigration Judge's determination is dated 26 April 2006.   At  that
   date,  as  already  noted,  no  Explanatory  Statement  and  accompanying
   documents had been received.  The only documentary  evidence  before  the
   Immigration Judge was that submitted with the grounds of  appeal  by  the
   appellant himself.  The Immigration Judge stated (paragraph 7) that there
   was no copy of the Visitor Application Form or the  documents  originally
   submitted by  the  appellant.   The  Immigration  Judge  noted  that  the
   respondent had twice been asked to produce these documents but had failed
   to do so.

11. The Immigration Judge therefore examined the letter of 31  August  2005,
   allegedly from Guaranty Trust, confirming that the appellant's father  is
   the sole signatory to a certain account number.  She rejected that letter
   as misspelled, ungrammatical, and failing to mention the company by name.
    She rejected a supporting notarial certificate as 'of little  evidential
   value' and criticised the appellant's father's personal  bank  statements
   as 'poor quality photocopies' (once the Explanatory Statement arrived the
   reason was clear:  the Entry Clearance Officer had  the  originals).  The
   Immigration Judge was satisfied that -

      "11.  Having considered the matter de novo, as I am obliged to  do,  I
      am satisfied that the respondent was fully justified on  the  evidence
      before him in arriving at the decision to refuse the application."

Grant of reconsideration

12. Senior Immigration Judge Storey granted permission  for  reconsideration
   because he considered that arguably it was not open  to  the  Immigration
   Judge to dismiss the appeal on the express basis that the respondent  was
   'fully justified in refusing his application on the evidence before  him'
   when the respondent had not produced that evidence  to  the  Tribunal  to
   enable such an assessment to  be  made.   The  appellant  has  no  United
   Kingdom representative and this review will therefore  be  considered  on
   the documents and matters before the Tribunal.

The Explanatory Statement

13. In considering materiality, I have the  advantage  which  the  appellant
   and Immigration Judge did  not,  of  having  before  me  the  Explanatory
   Statement   from the High Commission in Lagos.   The  file  now  contains
   two copies of the Explanatory Statement, apparently issued on 14 February
   2006.  It is unclear when these copies of the Explanatory Statement  were
   sent to, or received by, this Tribunal.  I can take that no further:   in
   each case, the Entry Clearance Officer's covering letter is  undated  and
   there is no envelope on the file to show when the bundles  were  sent  or
   received by the Tribunal.

14. The two copies of the respondent's bundle are  not  identical:  one  set
   contains  written  confirmation  from  Guaranty  Trust  that   the   bank
   statements relied upon and the letter relating  to  the  claimed  company
   bank account are indeed forged, while the other does not.

15. The Entry Clearance appeals record  sheet  shows  that  the  appeal  was
   passed to the Entry Clearance Manager on 5 December 2005, reviewed on  26
   January 2006, passed  to  an  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to  prepare  the
   Explanatory Statement on 3 February 2006, and that  on  9  February  2006
   someone decided to check the veracity of the bank statements.  The reply,
   that the statements were forged, was received on 13 February 2006 and the
   Entry Clearance Officer preparing the Explanatory Statement  was  advised
   to include that information in the  Explanatory  Statement  on  the  same
   date.

16.  The  Explanatory  Statement   indicates  that  'all  relevant   annexes
   indicated below [are] attached'; the Visitor Application Form and student
   supplementary questionnaire, the form N2 and  supporting  documents,  the
   form APP200, the college acceptance letter, the sponsor's bank statements
   and supporting letter and Guaranty  Trust  bank  statement  verification.
   There is no interview record; this application  was  dealt  with  by  the
   Entry Clearance Officer on the papers.  The Explanatory Statement  states
   that-

      "The appellant had sought entry clearance as a student via the courier
      system.  The application was considered on the basis of the statements
      made  on  the  Visitor  Application  Form  and  supporting   documents
      submitted.  The Entry Clearance Officer was  not  satisfied  that  the
      appellant met the requirements under paragraph 57 of  the  Immigration
      Rules for the reasons set  out  in  the  attached  notice  of  refusal
      (APP200).  A copy of all relevant indexes indicated below is attached.
      The  appellant  has  appealed  against  the  decision  to  refuse  the
      application and I have  reviewed  the  application  in  light  of  the
      grounds of appeal.
      I note that no fresh  compelling  evidence  has  been  submitted  and,
      furthermore, evidence has been obtained that proves the sponsor's bank
      statement to be a forgery.
      Whilst I am aware that  this  was  not  referred  to  in  the  APP200,
      nevertheless it damages the appellant's credibility and clearly raises
      doubts regarding how he would pay for  the  course  and  maintain  and
      accommodate herself for the duration of his proposed studies.
      I am not persuaded to  alter  the  original  decision  to  refuse  the
      application."
                                                            [Emphasis added]

17. An undated covering letter  in  standard  form  from  the  British  High
   Commission at Lagos states that -

      "I have reviewed the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  decision  following
      receipt of this appeal and carefully  considered  the  grounds.  I  am
      satisfied that the decision is correct  and  in  accordance  with  the
      Immigration Rules.
      Entry Clearance Officers in both Lagos and Abuja are  able  to  assess
      and  decide  applications  for  entry  clearance  primarily   on   the
      information  provided  in  the  application  form  and  the  documents
      submitted in support.  Entry Clearance Officers  may  make  additional
      enquiries or reference to local records to assist them in deciding  an
      application. In the minority of cases  when  an  interview  is  deemed
      necessary the Applicant will be asked to attend  in  person.  In  such
      cases the interview record will be included in the appeal bundle."

Discussion

18.  The  Immigration  Judge  declared  herself  satisfied  that  the  Entry
   Clearance Officer was fully justified in refusing entry clearance on  the
   evidence before him, without seeing that evidence.  I concur with  Senior
   Immigration Judge Storey in considering that as a plain error of law; the
   burden of proof is, as the Immigration Judge noted, on the appellant, but
   in assuming that the evidence before the Entry Clearance  Officer  'fully
   justified' the decision, without seeing it, the Immigration Judge did not
   apply the standard of balance of probabilities as she should  have  done.
   The question, therefore, is whether that rather  generous  assessment  of
   the Entry Clearance Officer's reasoning was a material error  of  law  on
   the particular facts of this appeal.

19. It is disappointing that  despite  directions  from  the  Tribunal,  the
   respondent failed to produce for the Immigration Judge hearing the bundle
   of documents  provided  by  the  appellant  against  which  he  made  his
   decision. That has become very common, regrettably, for reasons which are
   not clear to this Tribunal.  It may be said that the burden of  proof  is
   always upon the appellant, and that, of course, is  right,  but  when  he
   lodges his application and his appeal at the overseas post, the appellant
   provides the  documents  which  support  the  application  to  the  Entry
   Clearance Officer.  He is entitled to assume that the documents, some  of
   which may be  important  original  documents,  will  be  put  before  the
   Tribunal with the Entry Clearance Officer's response to  his  appeal.  He
   can be expected to make available any new documents which  have  come  to
   hand, but it is difficult to see how he can properly  be  criticised  for
   failing to send, direct to the Tribunal, documents he thinks are  already
   filed.

20. Where an Immigration Judge is faced with a  party's  failure  to  comply
   with directions, his first question must be  whether  he  has  sufficient
   material  before  him  to   enable   him   to   determine   the   appeal,
   notwithstanding such failure.  The absence of respondent's documents,  as
   in this appeal, causes particular difficulties in assessing  whether  the
   decision reached by the Entry Clearance Officer is  sustainable  in  law,
   but documents submitted by the non-defaulting party may enable the appeal
   to be determined.  Whether that is so  in  any  particular  appeal  is  a
   question for the Immigration Judge hearing the appeal.

21. If the Entry Clearance  Officer  disregards  the  plain  (and  repeated)
   direction of the Tribunal to send those documents to the Tribunal in time
   for the hearing, then he  must  take  the  chance  of  the  Tribunal  not
   understanding  his  reasoning  processes  and  not  agreeing   with   his
   assessment of the credibility of the appellant, on the basis of documents
   which are in his hands.  Where  documents  filed  by  an  appellant  were
   apparently genuine and sufficient to  sustain  his  claim,   even  though
   (unbeknown to the Immigration Judge)  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  had
   received evidence that  some  of  those  documents  were  forged,  it  is
   difficult to see how the Entry Clearance Officer could properly  complain
   of a positive  credibility  finding  by  the  Immigration  Judge  on  the
   material which was before him.

22. In the present appeal, that is not the factual  position:  although  the
   Immigration Judge made a legal error in  upholding  the  Entry  Clearance
   Officer's decision on the express basis of documents which  she  had  not
   seen, it was in the event immaterial, in  that  the  Immigration  Judge's
   rejection of the Guaranty Trust documents as unconvincing was  supported,
   had she known it, by the letter from Guaranty Trust stating in terms that
   they were forged.  The negative credibility finding was therefore  sound,
   even on the basis of the documents which  should  have  been  before  the
   Tribunal, and there was no material error of law in this determination.

23. I uphold the Immigration Judge's decision  and  there  is  no  need  for
   further reconsideration.


      DECISION


      The original Tribunal did not make a material error  of  law  and  the
      original determination of the appeal shall stand.
