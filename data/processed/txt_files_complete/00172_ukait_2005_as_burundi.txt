                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

This case is reported on the following points:

      a) the approach to be taken to "country expert" evidence  (see  4  and
         9);
      b) the methodology of the 'Ethnologue' web-site, and the weight to  be
         given to untested assertions of language skills (see 11);
      c) the meaning of "race" in the Refugee Convention (see 14-15);
      d) techniques of decision-writing (see 17); and
      e) the approach to be taken to Foreign and Commonwealth Office  travel
         advice (see 19).

It is not reported on the following points:

      f) what is to be expected of persons claiming to be  from  Burundi  by
         way of language skills  (for  which  see  SJ  [2005]  UKAIT  00134,
         explaining Rusiga [2005] EWCA Civ 407; or
      g) what is the current situation for Hutus on return to  Burundi,  and
         in particular to the Buyenzi area of greater Bujumbura  (for  which
         see AM [2005] UKAIT 00123, confirming SS (Burundi) CG [2004]  UKIAT
         00290).



   This is a case where the Home Office were  given  permission  to  appeal
   from a decision of an adjudicator (Mr L Saffer), sitting at Bradford  on
   3 March 2005, allowing an asylum and human rights appeal by someone  who
   claimed to  be  a  Hutu  citizen  of  Burundi.  Under  the  transitional
   provisions of  the  2004  Act,  the  case  proceeds  as  if  it  were  a
   reconsideration following review by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal;
   but only (see r. 62.7 of the 2005 Procedure Rules)  on  the  grounds  on
   which permission was given. These were that the adjudicator

      a) might have given undue weight to the report of a  "country  expert"
         (Professor James Fairhead of Sussex University),  who  had  neither
         met or spoken to the appellant himself, nor given enough details as
         to the sources of his knowledge of the languages spoken in Burundi;
         and
      b) might not have given enough reasons for finding  that  the  general
         situation for Hutus in Burundi had  got  notably  worse  since  the
         decision of the Immigration Appeal  Tribunal  in  SS  (Burundi)  CG
         [2004] UKIAT 00290.

2. The language point (a) arose because the appellant was unable  to  speak
   Kirundi, the national language of Burundi, and common to both Hutus  and
   Tutsis. She did claim to be able to understand it to an extent; but this
   was never put to the test, as she chose to be  interviewed  in  Swahili,
   and her "country expert" as we have seen did not interview her  at  all.
   Swahili is of course the  lingua  franca  of  a  number  of  surrounding
   countries, and in particular Tanzania. It is common ground however  that
   it is spoken in some areas of Burundi, which for  some  reason  generate
   what might appear a disproportionate number of the refugee  claims  made
   by persons claiming to be  citizens  of  that  country.  This  leads  to
   credibility  disputes  as  to  whether  such  non-Kirundi  speakers  are
   citizens of Burundi, as they claim, at all.

3. Such cases have come before the appellate authorities and the courts  in
   reported decisions several  times  already.  In  order  of  time,  those
   referred to before us were: AR [2004] UKIAT 00225; but this was reversed
   in Agnes Rusiga [2005] EWCA Civ 407  (we  should  like  to  express  our
   appreciation  for  the  Court  of  Appeal's  avoidance  of   unnecessary
   anonymity), and the effect of that further explained in SJ [2005]  UKAIT
   00134. Of these, only AR was available to the adjudicator when  he  sat,
   though it had re-appeared as Rusiga by the time review of  his  decision
   was granted (which was no doubt why that grant did  not  extend  to  the
   criticism of him for not following it as AR);  while  SJ  appeared  only
   while the present reconsideration was pending. It follows that, contrary
   to the present position, there was no effective 'country guidance'  case
   on the Kirundi problem when the adjudicator  reached  the  decision  now
   under challenge; and that our  decision  is  of  no  relevance  to  that
   general question (on which decision-makers should turn first to SJ), but
   only to the very limited one of whether he went  wrong  in  law  on  the
   information before him.

4. Professor Fairhead is a social anthropologist, who  did  fieldwork  from
   1986-89 in Rwanda and the DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo,  as  it
   now is], during which time he also lectured at the University of Rwanda.
   He says he first visited Burundi in 1981: though  we  should  have  very
   much liked to know the date of his last visit to that country, Mrs Singh
   did not suggest that he is not to be regarded as an academic  expert  on
   it, and we are prepared to accept him as such. That does not  of  course
   mean that anything falling from his pen is to be accepted as Gospel; but
   that decision-makers are entitled to accept his reasoned conclusions  on
   general questions, without detailed sourcing,  where  those  do  not  go
   against other information from  generally  accepted  background  sources
   before them, or reported decisions of the Tribunal. (On the other  hand,
   it would in our view be a  wrong  approach  in  law  not  to  engage  in
   vigorous critical analysis of "country experts"' views, where those were
   out of line with such material).

5. In this case, the adjudicator found (at � 60) "... that it is  perfectly
   feasible for someone from Burundi to speak Swahili as a  first  language
   and not to speak Kirundi". That was much too rosy a general view of  the
   background evidence, even at the date of the hearing, and, to the extent
   that it was not supported by anything in  that,  or  even  by  Professor
   Fairhead, amounted to an error of law. However, that brings  us  to  the
   crucial question of whether on all the evidence available at  the  time,
   including his, that finding did amount to a material error of law by the
   adjudicator.

6. What Professor Fairhead said  about  the  language  of  the  appellant's
   claimed place of origin (starting at � 5 of his report) was this:

   ...from 1993, as the conflict in Burundi  has  become  more  entrenched,
   Buyenzi became an 'ethnic ghetto'; a Hutu swahiliphone district with its
   own militia, defending itself against Tutsi militia and army units.

   We shall return to what else Professor Fairhead said about Buyenzi  when
   we come to ground b). The explanation he gives,  at  �  4,  for  Swahili
   having become the language of Buyenzi is  through  immigration,  in  the
   1930s, mainly from Tanzania and the [then Belgian] Congo;  coupled  with
   return, in the 1980s, of those who had sought refuge in those  countries
   in the 1970s. We cannot see how this  could  lead  to  acceptance  as  a
   Swahili-speaking native of  Buyenzi of someone who does not seem to have
   given any family history of immigration or emigration such as  Professor
   Fairhead describes; and this appellant claimed to  have  spent  no  more
   than a very limited time in a camp in what is now the DRC, between March
   and April 1994.

7. This is what Professor Fairhead  said  in  his  conclusions  (at  �  13)
   directed specifically to the languages used in Buyenzi:

   ...as a resident of Buyenzi, the  appellant  would  speak  Kiswahili  as
   their first language, and not Kirundi.  Whilst  some  Buyenzi  residents
   speak Kirundi too, it would not be unusual for some not to speak it,  or
   only to understand it. This  is  especially  the  case  for  the  moslem
   educated residents such as the appellant.

   We do not, as we have  said,  see  any  basis  in  Professor  Fairhead's
   reasoning at �� 4-5 for this  appellant  or  her  family  to  have  been
   Swahili-speakers in the first place. However,  this  point  was  neither
   pursued before the adjudicator, nor in the grounds of appeal  which  led
   to this reconsideration.

8. It follows that the adjudicator had before him a statement by  Professor
   Fairhead, unexceptionable because in accordance  with  other  background
   evidence, that people spoke Swahili in  Buyenzi;  and  a  contention  of
   Professor Fairhead's own that there would be those there who spoke  only
   Swahili, for which  he  gave  some  apparently  plausible,  and  so  far
   unchallenged historical  reasons  (though  our  views  on  their  proper
   application to the facts of this case will be clear). We note  that  the
   appellant had claimed to have been educated  in  an  Arabic  school  (so
   avoiding any suggestion that she must have learnt Kirundi in the  public
   schooling system). While her knowledge of Arabic has never been  put  to
   the test, there was no challenge to this part of her evidence,  and  the
   adjudicator was entitled to accept it.

9. A "country expert", like any other expert  witness,  may  (and  to  some
   extent needs to) work on the basis of the history he is given  by  those
   instructing him: what he must do is to make it  plain  what  comes  from
   them, and what from his own expertise. Usually in asylum and immigration
   cases individual history comes from the instructions given, and  general
   background from the "country expert"'s own knowledge: the real expertise
   comes in weighing the plausibility of one against the other.

10. In this case Professor Fairhead cannot have meant  to  suggest  he  took
   any  expert  view  as  to   this   appellant's   individual   linguistic
   competences, since he made it plain that he had never spoken to her; and
   there is nothing to show that the adjudicator  was  under  any  illusion
   about that. It  was  legitimate  for  Professor  Fairhead,  as  for  the
   adjudicator, to take account of the particular education  the  appellant
   claimed to have had; and, as we have seen, the adjudicator was  entitled
   (without any challenge on  the  basis  of  the  appellant's  lack  of  a
   significant family history of immigration or emigration) to  accept  his
   views,  which  were  based  on  apparent  expertise,  on  the  languages
   generally spoken (or not) in Buyenzi.

11. The adjudicator went much too far in what  he  purported  to  take  from
   Professor  Fairhead's  evidence  about  the  existence  of  Swahili-only
   speakers in Burundi generally, as we have explained at 5. The  point  he
   took (later in � 60) on the contents of the  'Ethnologue'  web-site  was
   misconceived: it should have been fairly clear that, while the 6,457,000
   population  of  Burundi  was  a  relatively  exact  census  figure,  the
   6,000,000 Kirundi-speakers world-wide represented  an  estimate  to  the
   nearest complete million. There  was  no  caution  expressed  by  either
   Professor Fairhead or the adjudicator as  to  the  appellant's  untested
   claim to understand, though not speak Kirundi.  Professor  Fairhead  was
   entitled, not having met her, or indeed holding himself out as an expert
   in the languages themselves, rather than their social  distribution,  to
   accept that as part of his instructions. If it had been crucial  to  his
   findings, the adjudicator would have needed at least to  make  it  clear
   that he himself realized that understanding any  Kirundi  represented  a
   wholly untested assertion by the appellant herself.

12. However it would have been enough for the adjudicator  to  find  in  the
   appellant's favour to accept what he correctly  noted  (at  �  31)  that
   Professor Fairhead  said about there being people in Buyenzi who did not
   speak, or (our emphasis) who only understood Kirundi. This, as  we  have
   seen at 6 - 10, he was entitled to do on the way the case was  presented
   before him. It follows that we do not see any material error of  law  in
   the adjudicator's decision on the language point (a).

13. Turning to the Hutu  situation  (point  b),  the  adjudicator  correctly
   summarized the effect of SS 04-290 at � 43. The complaints made on  this
   point in the grounds of appeal (drafted by the  presenting  officer  who
   appeared before the adjudicator) were that:

    5.   he failed to identify the "objective evidence" which had led him to
       conclude that things had got significantly worse since SS 04-290; and
    6. he "... identified a convention reason which is at best one based  on
       ethnitiy [sic]"

   Reconsideration  was  only  granted  on  the  point  at  5:  the  senior
   immigration judge who did so was understandably too busy, or too  polite
   to say anything about point 6. Since it may represent a misunderstanding
   of either the Refugee Convention or the English language on the part  of
   a presenting officer (as well as a regrettable lack of spelling or proof-
   reading), we had better put in  a  few  words  about  it.  (Perhaps  the
   draftsman only meant  to  distinguish  between  a  claim  based  on  the
   appellant's individual history, and one on her tribal origins, in  which
   case she need not take what we are about to say personally).

14. The Refugee Convention offers  protection  against  persecution  amongst
   other reasons because of a person's race. That good simple English  word
   covers any kind of tribal or ethnic identity they may be seen as having,
   and is most certainly not limited to such  features  as  the  colour  of
   their skin. It was good enough for the  framers  of  the  Convention  in
   1951, and should be good enough for us now.  We  strongly  suspect  that
   transatlantic history and practice since then has been responsible  both
   for  the  unnecessary  "ethnicity",  and  the  misconception  apparently
   represented by the presenting officer's use of it.

15. The great struggle to defeat the colour bar in the United States in  the
   1950s and 60s led first to the false impression that race was only about
   colour; and then to the further delusion that  not  racialism,  but  the
   word "race" itself was the evil to be avoided. Persecution  for  reasons
   of race was of course the main historical evil against  which  the  1951
   Convention was directed; and if it were thought  that  a  claim  can  be
   belittled by describing it as "at best  one  based  on  ethnitiy",  that
   would show a lack of understanding of history, as well as of  the  words
   of the Convention.

16. This however has little to do with point b),  on  which  reconsideration
   was granted. Here the adjudicator was criticized for not giving  details
   of the "objective evidence" which had led him to his conclusion  on  it.
   What he had done, quite legitimately in our view, at � 68 was  to  refer
   back to it in the words "Having summarised the objective evidence  above
   ...". The draftsman of the grounds of appeal has picked  out  the  words
   which follow "... it is my judgment that unfortunately the situation  in
   Burundi has deteriorated since  [SS  04-290]  ..."  without  taking  any
   account of that reference back.

17. This no  doubt  represents  a  misunderstanding  of  a  common  judicial
   technique, rather than any deliberate attempt to mislead  the  Tribunal;
   but it is a misunderstanding which should not be allowed to  persist  on
   either side in cases of this kind. It is enough if  there  is  a  proper
   analysis of evidence where it is set out (in other words one which gives
   the decision-maker's own reasoned views on the relevant points),  and  a
   clear reference back to that in  the  conclusions,  particularly  (where
   relevant) on any credibility findings. So long as all that is done,  no-
   one should try to blame  decision-makers  for  not  repeating  in  their
   conclusions an analysis already set out.  For  our  part  we  should  go
   further and say that any unnecessary repetition is so tedious as  to  be
   positively wrong in a  class  of  case  where  decisions  are  sometimes
   unavoidably lengthy in any event.

18. It follows that what we are concerned with is whether the  adjudicator's
   analysis of the "objective evidence", set out at �� 53-55,  63  and  68,
   and including his references to Professor Fairhead's evidence at ��  32,
   was a proper one. This is not an exercize on which  we  (or  the  senior
   immigration judge who granted reconsideration) should have been  invited
   to set out without any details of what was complained of (because of the
   misunderstanding referred to at 17);  but  because  reconsideration  was
   granted on this point we shall deal with it, as briefly as possible.

19. We have to say we discount what the adjudicator said about  Foreign  and
   Commonwealth Office advice not to travel to Burundi at �  54.  Decision-
   makers are entitled to refer to such advice; but not in our view without
   reminding themselves that it is directed to citizens  of  this  country,
   who have a free choice as to whether they travel to other ones, or  not.
   It should be remembered that asylum-seekers are only entitled to be here
   as a matter of necessity, and not  of  choice.  While  the  Foreign  and
   Commonwealth Office advice, seen in that light, is of general background
   relevance to the conditions in the country in question, it could not  on
   its own have entitled the adjudicator to take the view  that  there  had
   been a significant change in those since the "country guidance" decision
   before him.

20. On the other hand, the adjudicator gave proper details at �  55  of  the
   Human Rights Watch report of  13 January 2005, and the UNHCR  one  of  1
   February. It might perhaps have been argued that  these  came  too  soon
   after the decision in SS 04-290 (issued 29 October 2004) for  what  they
   contained to represent a recent worsening of the position of  Hutus  (as
   opposed to a different view of the situation already considered in SS 04-
   290). However, the existence of these reports does make  it  clear  that
   what Professor Fairhead had to say on this point was by no means out  of
   line with the background evidence; so the adjudicator  was  entitled  to
   rely on his summary of Professor Fairhead's remarks  at  �  32,  and  to
   agree with them without giving further reasons, as he did at � 68.

21. So that those who read this can see what  Professor  Fairhead  said,  we
   shall pick out the salient points of it.

   5. ... whilst Buyenzi was still generally acknowledged as  an  ethnically
      mixed neighbourhood in 1995, the repeated waves  of  ethnic  cleansing
      resulted in it acquiring a steadily stronger Hutu identity  from  then
      on. By the end of the 1990s it was a Hutu ghetto,  subject  to  night-
      time terror attacks by Tutsi militias, and also  by  daytime  reprisal
      and looting raids by Hutu insurgents from the nearby hills.
   6. ... In late July 2002, Buyenzi became an  ethnic  battleground.  Since
      then it has remained at the centre of the Burundian war/peace process.
   7. ...
   8. ...
   9. On surface impressions, Burundi is current [sic] in a period of peace-
      building and rapprochement between warring parties [but such  attempts
      have come and gone before]. Moreover the  fighting  continues  in  the
      appellant's home areas.
  10. The continuing level of conflict in Burundi means that there is a very
      real risk that the appellant  would  suffer  persecution  due  to  her
      ethnicity whether by state agents acting in an unofficial capacity, or
      by ethnic militia that the authorities cannot control. ...

23. We are very far from saying that we should have taken the same  view  on
   the situation on Professor Fairhead's evidence as the  adjudicator  did;
   but in our view it is enough to cite the summary with which  the  recent
   decision of the Tribunal in AM [2005] UKAIT 00123 begins, to see that it
   remains a possible view in individual cases:

   This case is reported to provide confirmation of  the  general  guidance
   given in SS (Burundi) CG [2004] UKIAT 00290. Individual  appellants  who
   come from particular areas may still establish a  well-founded  fear  of
   return.

   As it happened, the area from which the appellant in AM 05-123  happened
   to come was once again Buyenzi, and on this basis the  Tribunal  quashed
   the adjudicator's decision and allowed the original  appeal.  They  made
   clear that their decision turned on its own  facts;  but  those  did  of
   course include a good deal of background material.

24. It follows  that  we  have  reached  the  view  that  the  adjudicator's
   decision, both on point a)  as  to  what  the  language  spoken  by  the
   appellant had to say about her origin,  and  on  point  b),  as  to  the
   general risk faced by Hutus in her  home  area,  is  one  which  he  was
   entitled to reach at the time he wrote, and for the reasons he gave.  It
   does not represent what we think the current  approach  to  the  factual
   questions in such cases should be, for which see SJ  05-134  (explaining
   Rusiga) and AM 05-123 (confirming SS 04-290); but  the  adjudicator  was
   faced with a situation in which that guidance did not exist, and in  our
   view made a  determined  and  energetic  attempt  to  grapple  with  the
   problems that posed, without running into any  material  error  of  law.
   There was a time when there was reason to suspect some  adjudicators  of
   making inadequately reasoned decisions to allow appeals as an  easy  way
   out of such problems; but that was very much not the case here.

The original Tribunal did not make a material error of law and the  original
determination of the appeal stands.

                                                                       [pic]
