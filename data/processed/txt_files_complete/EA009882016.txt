                            DECISION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Upper Tribunal Judge Christine Martin, sitting  as  a  first-
    tier judge at Manchester on 2 May 2017), to  for want  of  jurisdiction
    an EEA extended family member appeal by a citizen of  Sri  Lanka,  born
    1986.


 2. The decision under appeal was based on Sala  (EFMs:  Right  of  Appeal:
    Albania) [2016] UKUT 411 (IAC). As that  decision  was  disapproved  in
    Mohd. Yasir Khan & another [2017] EWCA Civ 1755, the parties are agreed
    that the appeal  will  have  to  be  heard  afresh  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. Since the appellant lives in Ilford, that will be  at  Taylor
    House.

Appeal : decision set aside
Fresh hearing before any first-tier judge
