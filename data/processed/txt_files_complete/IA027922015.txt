Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss K Rahman    (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr C Bates   (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal, brought with the
permission of a judge of the Upper Tribunal, from a decision of the  First-
tier Tribunal  (Judge P J M Hollingworth)  hereinafter  "the Judge")
dismissing his appeal against the respondent's decision of  7 January 2015
to remove him from the United Kingdom.

2.   By way of background, the appellant is a national of India and  he  was
born on 21 November 1966.   He  claims  to  have  entered  the  UK,  in  a
clandestine manner, on 1 September 1993 and also claims to have been here,
continuously, ever since.  It is  recorded  that  on  8 September 1993  he
applied for asylum and that on 27 October 1994 he was served with official
documentation referred to as "IS.151A".  His  asylum  claim  was  not  dealt
with until 10 March 1997 when it was refused.   He  appealed  against  the
refusal and the appeal was dismissed on 11 August 1997.  It appears he then
ceased reporting to the Home Office and became an absconder.  He next  came
to the attention of  the  UK  authorities  in  December 2013  when  he  was
arrested  in  connection  with  suspicion  of  fraud  although  he  was  not
subsequently convicted of any criminal  offence.   On  30 October 2014  he
applied for leave to remain in the  UK  under  Article 8  of  the  European
Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on the basis of his private life.   A  key
part of his claim was that he had been in the UK for a continuous period  in
excess of 20 years.

3.   In considering  the  application  the  respondent  had  regard  to  the
Immigration Rules  and,  in  particular,   paragraphs 276ADE-276DH   and
Appendix FM.  In that context, the respondent decided  that  the  appellant
did  not  fall  foul  of  the  "suitability  requirements".   However,   the
respondent said he did not meet the "eligibility requirements" for a  parent
or a partner (he had never claimed he had).  The crux  of  the  respondent's
consideration,  therefore,  was  in   relation   to   private   life   under
paragraph 276ADE.  In order to succeed under that particular  rule  it  was
necessary for the appellant to demonstrate that he  had  lived  continuously
in the UK for at least 20 years discounting any period of imprisonment.  As
to  that,  the  respondent  thought  that  although   there   was   evidence
demonstrating he had been  in  the  UK  for  certain  periods,  he  had  not
provided persuasive evidence demonstrating that he  had  been  present  here
from March 1997 to June 2005 (see paragraph 16 of the respondent's decision
letter of 7 January 2015).  The respondent also thought, having regard  to
paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) that the appellant had failed to  show  that  there
would be very significant obstacles to his integration into India if he  had
to return there.  So, the requirements of  the  Rules  relating  to  private
life under Article 8 were not met.  The respondent did go  on  to  consider
whether there were "exceptional circumstances" which would justify  a  grant
of leave under Article 8 outside of the Rules but concluded that there were
not.

4.   The appellant appealed and it was that appeal which was  dismissed  and
which, in turn, has led to this  appeal  before  the  Upper Tribunal.   The
appeal was dealt with by  way  of  an  oral  hearing  which  took  place  on
21 August 2015.   Both  parties  were  represented  at  that  hearing  and
the Judge heard oral evidence from the appellant and from  one  witness  on
his behalf.  At the hearing the  appellant  sought  to  rely  upon  his  own
evidence, that  of  his  witness  one  Mr Surjit Singh,  some  documentary
evidence said to demonstrate his presence in the UK  at  various  dates  and
some DVD evidence which was said to show the appellant's presence in the  UK
at various dates  because  dates  appeared  on  the  footage  of  the  DVD's
demonstrating, claimed the appellant, the dates when the filming  had  taken
place.

5.   The first part of the Judge's determination, which was promulgated  on
21 September 2015, is given over to a summary of what was said in evidence
before  him  and  what  was  said  in  submissions  to  him.   As   to   his
deliberations and conclusions, the Judge then said this:

         "30.  I  have   been   provided   with   a   determination   by   a
             Special Adjudicator following a hearing dated 14th July 1997
             in relation to this Appellant.  No dispute has occurred as  to
             the identity of this Appellant.  It has not been disputed that
             the Appellant at the hearing in 1997 was the Appellant  before
             me.  The  Special Adjudicator  did  not  find  the  Appellant
             credible.

         31.  The Special Adjudicator has referred to the Appellant  having
             asserted that he arrived in the United Kingdom  illegally  on
             1st September 1993.   At  the  penultimate  paragraph  the
             Special Adjudicator states  that  even  if  he  accepted  the
             Appellant's account of his experiences  in  1991-2  given  the
             time which has elapsed since his departure  and  the  improved
             situation in the  Punjab,  the  Special Adjudicator  was  not
             satisfied the Appellant  would  be  of  any  interest  to  the
             authorities even if he ever had been.  On the evidence  before
             the Special Adjudicator and on the lighter standard of  proof
             the Special Adjudicator was not satisfied the  Appellant  had
             made out a claim for  asylum  under  the  Convention  and  the
             appeal was dismissed.  The  Special Adjudicator  agreed  with
             both limbs of the certificate.

         32.  I take the decision of the Special Adjudicator as my starting
             point  in  relation  to  the  credibility  of  the  Appellant.
             Further doubt has arisen as to the Appellant's credibility  in
             the context of discrepancies between that which the  Appellant
             has told Immigration Officers and that which he recounted  at
             the   hearing   before   me.    In   the   memorandum    dated
             29th December 2013 which  reflects  that  which  took  place
             between the Appellant and members  of  the  Staffordshire  LIT
             arrest team it is stated that when conducting  his  mitigating
             circumstances interview the subject, or  in  other  words  the
             Appellant, then claimed that he had claimed asylum in  the  UK
             in 1993 'and that he had now been granted'.  The  author  goes
             on to state that his story sounded quite genuine and coincided
             with how immigration dealt  with  immigration  offenders  back
             then.

         33.  I find that the Appellant deliberately set out to deceive  the
             authorities.  The Special Adjudicator dismissed  his  appeal.
             The Appellant had arrived for  that  hearing.   The  Appellant
             must have been perfectly well aware that he had failed in  his
             claim for asylum.  I find substantial damage has been done  to
             the Appellant's credibility.

         34.  In the memorandum to which I  refer  it  is  stated  that  the
             Appellant had a father and  mother  back  in  India.   At  the
             hearing before me the Appellant stated that his father  passed
             away in 2000 and his mother in the  last  two  months.   Given
             that  the  interview  with  the   Appellant   took   pace   in
             December 2013 I find that the Appellant has set out to deceive
             me at  the  hearing.   He  clearly  told  the  authorities  in
             December 2013 that he had his father and mother back in India.
              I find that such substantial damage  has  been  done  to  the
             Appellant's credibility that I do not accept his accounts.

         35.  Mr Surjit Singh was called as a witness  on  behalf  of  the
             Appellant.  At  paragraph 2  of  his  witness  statement  the
             witness states that they met in  a  pub  where  they  used  to
             drink.  The witness had known the  Appellant  since  the  year
             2000.  I have set out the evidence given by the witness above.
              The witness has explained the  gaps  which  took  place  when
             there was no contact.  I do not find taking  the  evidence  of
             the witness at its highest that it is established on the basis
             of Mr Surjit Singh's evidence that the Appellant has been in
             the country continuously since the year 2000.

         36.  I have been provided with letters and  references  from  those
             who state that they know the Appellant.  These  are  contained
             in the Appellant's bundle.  The index refers to these.  Taking
             this evidence at its highest, I do not find that this evidence
             establishes that  the  Appellant  has  been  in  this  country
             continuously during the periods referred to in that  evidence.
             I accept the submission on behalf of the  Respondent  made  by
             Mr Bates, that in the absence  of  the  attendance  of  these
             witnesses and therefore in the  absence  of  cross-examination
             little weight should be attached to this evidence.

         37.  The question arises as  to  the  extent  to  which  the  other
             evidence  submitted  assists  the  Appellant.   I  have   been
             provided by learned Counsel with a  skeleton  argument  which
             sets out an analysis of the available evidence.   The  crucial
             period in respect of which the  Respondent  has  not  accepted
             that the Appellant has been in the United Kingdom spans  from
             that period in 1997 following the absconding of the  Appellant
             to 2004.  This evidence includes DVD material.  On the morning
             of the hearing a seventh DVD was  produced.   Learned Counsel
             described what was on it.  Learned Counsel gave the  date  as
             1999.

         38.  Mr Bates on behalf of the Respondent accepted  that  I  could
             take the schedule in relation  to  the  DVDs  which  has  been
             prepared on behalf of the Appellant as accurate.  I  explained
             to Ms Bhachu that difficulty arose in the context of the  DVD
             evidence.  The sourced material from which the DVDs  had  been
             compiled  was  not  available  for   inspection.    In   these
             circumstances I am not prepared to accept any dates  appearing
             on the DVDs since it is impossible to verify the  accuracy  of
             such dates in the  light  of  the  state  of  the  technology.
             Mr Bates provided material in this context but  even  leaving
             that to one side, in the absence of being able to match  dates
             shown on camcorder evidence or mini DVDs or video cassettes or
             whatever technology was employed at the  time  to  record  the
             events shown on the DVDs  there  is  nothing  to  support  the
             genuineness of the dates shown on the DVDs.  I explained  this
             difficulty to Ms Bhachu.  There was  no  application  for  an
             adjournment.

         39.  I do not find  that  any  satisfactory  explanation  has  been
             provided for  the  failure  to  provide  any  of  the  sourced
             material.  I have set out that which was said by the Appellant
             in the  context  of  the  sourced  material  relating  to  the
             wedding.  Even if this explanation is accepted  inadequate  or
             no explanations have been provided in relation to the  absence
             of the sourced material for the other DVDs  having  been  made
             available for inspection.  The letter from Malik Law Chambers
             refers to video footage.  The letter to which I refer is dated
             16th March 2015.

         40.  The evidence relied upon as set out in the  skeleton  argument
             for 1997 refers to the date of submission of  the  appeal  and
             the letter from Taranjit Singh  Bains  who  worked  with  the
             Appellant for two years from 1997.   The  1998  entry  in  the
             skeleton argument refers to the DVD evidence.  I have rejected
             that evidence for the reasons which I have  given.   There  is
             then a reference to the medical notes fro 20th March 1996 to
             24th May 2015.  The medical evidence on the file in fact shows
             medical records from 2000 to  2015  and  medical  records  for
             1996.  There is a gap in respect of 1997, 1998 and 1999.   The
             skeleton argument summary then refers  to  page  35A/B  letter
             from Taranjit Singh Bains which repeats the entry for  1997.
             Exhibit O on the Appendix A supplementary bundle refers to a
             DVD.  In respect of 1999 the skeleton argument summary  refers
             again to the letter from Taranjit Singh Bains and exhibits E,
             F, G, I and J on Appendix A supplementary bundle schedule  of
             evidence.  These refer to DVDs and to a Wikipedia  source.   I
             do no find that the Wikipedia reference advances the matter.

         41.  At page 35 of the main bundle received under the cover of the
             letter dated  23rd February 2015  from  Malik Law  Chambers
             Solicitors appears a note or letter from Taranjit Singh Bains
             which refers to the Appellant.  The author states that he  met
             the Appellant at his workplace in 1997.  The author goes on to
             state that he worked with me  about  two  years.   The  author
             continues we became friends and after he left  work  we  still
             met each other now and then over the years.

         42.  Leaving aside the fact that this is not in statement form this
             note or letter is somewhat vague given that the  reference  is
             to working with the Appellant for  about  two  years.   It  is
             unclear when in 1997 the author Taranjit Singh Bains met the
             Appellant and it is unclear when he ceased to work  with  him.
             There is no reference to the  basis  on  which  the  Appellant
             worked at the workplace with Taranjit Singh Bains or whether
             he was there for the majority of time or not and what holidays
             or leave he took.  In these circumstances I do not  find  that
             this letter establishes that the Appellant was continuously in
             the country in 1997 and thereafter for about two years.

         43.  At page 33 appears a note or letter from Saeed Anwar.   This
             refers to first meeting  the  Appellant  in  1996  as  a  work
             colleague.   The  author  states  that  in  relation  to  time
             friendship since we met in 1996 they are still friends and see
             each other occasionally.  I do not  find  that  this  note  or
             letter establishes any sound basis  for  concluding  that  the
             Appellant has been in the country continuously  from  1996  to
             2004 which is the end of the period  in  dispute  between  the
             Appellant and the Respondent.

         44.  At page 37 appears a letter from Mr Surjit Singh.  In  that
             letter Mr Surjit Singh who gave oral evidence which I have set
             out above  states  that  the  Appellant  has  never  left  the
             United Kingdom since  his  first  meeting  with  him  in  the
             United Kingdom.  I have set out the witness's  oral  evidence
             above and find that this assertion has been undermined for the
             reasons I have given above.

         45.  At page 39 appears a letter from Kulwan Rai.  The author met
             the Appellant first in 2010.  This does not  relate,  plainly,
             to the period in dispute between the parties.

         46.  At page 45 the General Secretary Gurdwara Singh  Sabha  Akaal
             Darbar  in  a  letter  dated  28th October 2014  refers  to
             confirming that the Appellant had been known to the author for
             the last eight  years  approximately.   Again  this  does  not
             assist in respect of the period in dispute.

         47.  The bank documentation adduced from Barclays does  not  assist
             either with regard to the period in dispute.

         48.  I have set out  Ms Bhachu's  submissions  on  behalf  of  the
             Appellant above.  Ms Bhachu submitted that the Appellant  had
             made a significant effort to obtain evidence.  I have set  out
             the submissions of Mr Bates on behalf of the Respondent which
             identifies those areas of evidence in  relation  to  which  no
             attempt has been made to obtain evidence and submit it  either
             to the Respondent or to the Tribunal.  So far  as  photographs
             of the Appellant  are  concerned  in  relation  to  background
             settings, even taking this evidence at its highest, I  do  not
             find that I can conclude on the balance of probabilities, that
             the Appellant has established using those  photographs  either
             individually or collectively or in conjunction with the  other
             evidence  submitted  that  the  Appellant  has  been  in   the
             United Kingdom continuously for the period in dispute between
             the  parties.   I  have  rejected  the  credibility   of   the
             Appellant.  I have considered the question of  the  supporting
             evidence without applying Tanveer Ahmed.

         49.  Ms Bhachu submitted that those who have been  here  illegally
             are less likely to leave a paper trail.  The  difficulty  with
             this submission  is  that  the  Appellant  himself  has  given
             evidence as to operating  motorcars.   On  the  basis  of  the
             Appellant's evidence which I have set out it is reasonably  to
             be anticipated that records would exist of  the  registrations
             and insurance of these vehicles.  Such evidence has  not  been
             furnished.  No explanation has been provided  for  failing  to
             provide it.

         50.  A photocopy of a national insurance card  has  been  provided.
             No evidence has been obtained from the authorities as  to  the
             date this national insurance card was issued or what  payments
             have been  made  by  the  Appellant  in  respect  of  national
             insurance following the issue of this card.   Annexed  to  the
             photocopy of the national insurance card is pay information in
             respect of the Appellant.  This relates to 2003.  The employer
             is East End Foods plc.  The gross pay referred to is  �64.35.
             Gross pay T/d is given as �4,233.61.  I have not been provided
             with any further evidence amplifying the period of  time  over
             which this pay was earned.  I do not find  that  the  evidence
             submitted to which I have referred in relation to gross pay of
             �64.35   establishes   that   the   Appellant   was   in   the
             United Kingdom continuously in the year 2003.

         51.  I have  set  out  my  analysis  of  the  available  supporting
             evidence on individual footings.  I have given my reasons  for
             not accepting that this evidence taken on that basis,  enables
             the conclusion to be reached that the  Appellant  was  in  the
             United Kingdom continuously during the period in dispute.   I
             have considered this evidence cumulatively.   I  do  not  find
             that even on a cumulative basis  the  evidence  is  sufficient
             since on this cumulative footing, I  nevertheless  still  find
             that the DVD evidence for the reasons which I have given above
             does not establish the presence of the Appellant on the  dates
             given.  I have also approached the question of the  supporting
             evidence on the footing of Tanveer Ahmed.  On this  basis  in
             the light  of  my  findings  as  to  the  credibility  of  the
             Appellant, I treat the rest of the evidence  provided  in  the
             round which is of a documentary nature and I reject it.

         52.  I do not find for the reasons given above that  the  Appellant
             has established that he has been in the United Kingdom for  a
             period of twenty years.  The question therefore arises  as  to
             whether there are very significant obstacles.

         53.  Having rejected the Appellant's evidence I do not accept  that
             his parents are not both still  alive  and  living  in  India.
             Neither do I accept that the  Appellant  is  not  on  speaking
             terms with his two brothers.  The  Appellant  agreed  that  he
             spoke to a cousin.  I find that the  Appellant  would  receive
             assistance from his family if he were to  return.   Given  his
             age at his departure  from  India  I  do  not  find  that  the
             Appellant would have difficulty  in  readjusting  to  life  in
             India.  The Appellant used an interpreter before me.  He  used
             English on certain occasions but the  quality  of  his  spoken
             English was not particularly good  and  it  was  necessary  to
             revert to the interpreter.   The  Appellant  has  demonstrated
             that he can secure employment.   I  find  that  the  Appellant
             would be able to support himself  if  he  were  to  return  to
             India.  I have set out the  submissions  given  by  Ms Bhachu
             above.  I do not find that it has been  established  that  any
             obstacles would exist to the reintegration of the Appellant in
             India or that he would be unable to readjust.  I  accept  that
             there would be a relatively brief period of  readjustment  but
             that is all.  I reject the contention  that  very  significant
             obstacles exist first on the footing that I have rejected  the
             Appellant's credibility and do not  accept  his  accounts.   I
             reject the contention that very significant obstacles exist on
             the alternative basis that even taking  the  position  of  the
             Appellant at its highest that there would be such obstacles if
             the Appellant were to return for  the  reasons  which  I  have
             given.

         54.  It is necessary to consider whether there would be a breach of
             Article 8.

         55.  It is necessary to apply the step-by-step approach set out  in
             Nhundu and Chiwera (01/TH/0631).  The following questions have
             to be asked.  Is there an existing private or family life?  Is
             there an interference with that private or family life?   Does
             that  interference  pursue  a   legitimate   aim?    Is   that
             interference in accordance with the law?  Is it proportionate?
               In Bosanago [2002] UKIAT 01054, it was  established  that  a
             relationship that had lasted for  three  years  was  not  long
             established.  Knowledge on the part of one spouse at the  time
             of the marriage that rights of residence  of  the  other  were
             precarious mitigates against a finding that an order excluding
             the latter spouse violates Article 8.   Whether  interference
             with  family  rights  is  justified  in   the   interests   of
             controlling immigration  will  depend  on  the  facts  of  the
             particular case and the circumstances prevailing in the  state
             whose actions are impugned.

         56.  In R (Razgar) v SSHD UKHL  [2004]  INLR 349  the  questions
             referred to were these:

             (i)  Will the proposed removal be an interference by a  public
                  authority with the exercise of the  applicant's  right  to
                  respect for his private or (as the  case  may  be)  family
                  life?

             (ii) If so, will such interference have consequences  of  such
                  gravity  as  potentially  to  engage  the   operation   of
                  Article 8?

             (iii)    If so, is such interference in  accordance  with  the
                  law?

             (iv) If so, is such interference  necessary  in  a  democratic
                  society in the  interests  of  national  security,  public
                  safety or the economic wellbeing of the country,  for  the
                  prevention of disorder or crime,  for  the  protection  of
                  health or morals, or for the protection of the rights  and
                  freedoms of others?

             (v)   If  so,  is  such  interference  proportionate  to   the
                  legitimate public end sought to be achieved.

         57.  In Huang [2007] UKHL 11 the approach to  proportionality  was
             set out at paragraph 20.  In an Article 8  case  where  this
             question is reached, the ultimate question for the Immigration
             and Asylum Chamber is whether the refusal of leave to enter or
             remain, in circumstances where the life of the  family  cannot
             reasonably be expected to be enjoyed  elsewhere,  taking  full
             account of considerations weighing in favour of  the  refusal,
             prejudices the family  life  of  the  applicant  in  a  manner
             sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of the  fundamental
             right protected by Article 8.  If the answer to this question
             is affirmative, the refusal is unlawful and the authority must
             so decide.  It is  not  necessary  that  the  Immigration  and
             Asylum Chamber, directing itself along the lines indicated  in
             this opinion, need ask in addition where the case meets a test
             of exceptionality.

         58.  I accept the Appellant has been leading a private life in  the
             United Kingdom.  It has not been established that he has led a
             family life in the United Kingdom.  I  find  the  first  four
             criteria in Razgar are satisfied.  The question arises  as  to
             proportionality.

         59.  I have rejected the  Appellant's  account.   He  entered  this
             country  illegally.    He  has  set   out   to   deceive   the
             authorities.  His claim for asylum was rejected.   The  policy
             and rationale of the Immigration Rules must be observed.  The
             pubic interest must be accorded the fullest weight.   I  apply
             Section 117.  The Appellant is not able to speak English very
             well.  I accept  that  he  could  be  self-sufficient  in  the
             United Kingdom.   He  has  formed  his  private  life  on  a
             precarious basis.  He entered the country illegally.  He  came
             to the attention  of  the  authorities  as  explained  in  the
             memorandum of December 2013.  Effective immigration control is
             to be maintained.

         60   Taking into account all the positive factors to be advanced on
             behalf of the Appellant which have been set out by  Ms Bhachu
             and in the skeleton argument and in the arguments put  forward
             in the papers on his behalf, I find that the factors in favour
             of his removal taking into account the public interest and  in
             applying Section 117 outweigh those factors in favour  of  his
             remaining.  I find that it would be proportionate for  him  to
             be removed.  Accordingly I do not find there would be a breach
             of Article 8.

         61.  I have considered the evidence  within  the  period  which  is
             disputed namely from after the Appellant's absconding in  1997
             until 2004 on the alternative bases to which I  have  referred
             above.  The analysis which I have  set  out  relating  to  the
             evidence in that period has led to  the  conclusion  given  my
             rejection of the Appellant's credibility, that  the  Appellant
             does not satisfy me on the balance of probabilities,  that  he
             has been continuously in the United Kingdom during the period
             in dispute between the parties.

         62.  I have further considered the  matter  on  the  basis  of  the
             Respondent's acceptance of the Appellant having  been  in  the
             United Kingdom for the undisputed  periods  which  fall  both
             before and after the period in dispute.  Having  rejected  the
             Appellant's credibility I do not find that the  Appellant  has
             established on the balance of  probability  that  despite  the
             acceptance  by  the  Respondent  of  his   presence   in   the
             United Kingdom during the periods not in dispute that he  was
             in fact in the United Kingdom continuously during the  period
             in dispute.

         63.  For the reasons given above I dismiss the appeal."

6.   Although the respondent had identified the period in dispute  as  being
that from 1997 to 2005, and although this is not explicitly  stated  in  the
determination, it would appear that the main concern of  the Judge  related
to the years 1997, 1998 and 1999.  It is clear he  was  not  satisfied  that
the evidence did demonstrate the appellant's presence during that period.

7.   The  appellant,  through  his  representatives,  sought  permission  to
appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  The grounds as drafted seemed to me to be  a
little unfocused in some respects but, essentially, and in summary,  it  was
contended that the Judge had erred in the following way:

    (a)   failing  to  properly  consider  the  evidence   concerning   the
         paragraph 276ADE issues;

    (b)  failing, with respect to the adverse  credibility  assessment,  to
         take into account  and  accept  the  appellant's  explanations  for
         discrepancies in the evidence;

    (c)  failing to correctly identify what the disputed period was.

8.    Permission  was  originally  refused  by  a  judge   of   the   First-
tier Tribunal who thought that  the  grounds  were  "nothing  more  than  a
disagreement with the findings of the Judge".  However, the application was
renewed though the renewed application did not  raise  any  new  matters  of
substance  which  had  not  been  covered  in  the  original  grounds.    On
13 March 2016 a judge of the Upper Tribunal granted permission  and  said
this:

         "It is not an error of law for  the  First-tier Tribunal  to  make
         findings against the appellant.  It is  however  arguable  that  in
         reaching its decision the First-tier Tribunal failed to  weigh  in
         the balance all of the evidence that was before it in  the  context
         of assessing the appellant's claimed long residence."

9.   Permission having been granted there was  then  a  hearing  before  the
Upper Tribunal so that the question of whether the Judge had erred in  law
could be considered.  Directions also made provision, in the  event  of  the
decision being set aside, for the Upper Tribunal to proceed to  remake  the
decision at  the  same  hearing  though,  in  fact,  that  did  not  happen.
Representation,  at  the  hearing  before   me,   was   as   stated   above.
Miss Rahman, for the appellant, relied upon the grounds of application  and
also upon a skeleton argument which had been prepared on 18 April 2016.  In
that skeleton argument it  was  contended  that  the Judge  had,  in  fact,
"applied a higher standard of proof to the  appellant's  evidence"  than  he
was required to do.  A particular example given, in that  regard,  was  with
respect to his treatment of the DVD evidence.  Reference was made  to  other
evidence and it was contended that if  the Judge  had  considered  the  DVD
evidence in light  of  the  other  evidence  he  would  have  arrived  at  a
different outcome.  It was also asserted that  it  was  "highly  improbable"
that the appellant would enter the UK clandestinely, then leave  the  UK  in
the same manner after the refusal of his  asylum  claim  in  1997,  only  to
return, again in a clandestine manner, shortly afterwards.

10.  At the hearing Miss Rahman made very detailed oral  submissions  based
upon a close examination of the Judge's determination.  She  observed  that
the Home Officer had accepted the appellant's presence in the UK, albeit an
unlawful presence,  from  1993  to  a  date  at  some  point  in  1997  and,
thereafter, from 2005.  She submitted that the Judge had failed to  provide
adequate reasons  for  his  conclusion  concerning  paragraph 276ADE.   She
contended he had erred in first of all taking a  negative  view  as  to  the
appellant's credibility and only  then  asking  himself  whether  there  was
evidence available to offset that negative credibility  finding.   That  was
an error because the Judge was required to consider  all  of  the  evidence
together as one composite whole.   At  paragraph 38  of  his  determination
the Judge had applied a higher standard of proof.

11.  Mr Bates, for the respondent, submitted that credibility  had  been  a
key consideration for the Judge.  He had been correct to  use  the  earlier
determination of the  Special Adjudicator,  concerning  the  failed  asylum
appeal, as his starting point.  All of his findings had  been  appropriately
open to him.  There was no error of law in  the  decision  and  the  grounds
represented only disagreement and dispute over his factual findings.

12.  I have concluded that the Judge did  not  err  in  law  and  that  his
decision shall stand.  I have set out my reasoning, in this regard, below.

13.  Turning, first of all, to the written grounds of application, I do  not
think it can be said that, in general terms, the Judge erred in failing  to
properly consider the evidence regarding the paragraph 276ADE  issues.   In
fact, as is amply illustrated by the passage of his  reasoning  I  have  set
out above, the Judge did  give  very  full  consideration  to  the  various
aspects of the evidence which he was called upon  to  assess.   Nor,  in  my
judgment, can it be said that, in assessing credibility, he failed  to  take
account  of  what  the  appellant  had  had  to  say.   He  summarised   the
appellant's evidence from paragraphs 3 to 15 of the determination.  It does
not seem to me that, having  done  that,  it  can  be  said  that  he  would
subsequently  have  lost  sight  of  it  when  reaching  his  findings   and
conclusions.  Further, the grounds do not set out the explanations  said  to
have been given by the appellant for discrepancies in the evidence which  it
is said were overlooked.  Finally  as  to  the  written  grounds,  there  is
nothing in the  point  concerning  the  alleged  failure  of  the Judge  to
properly identify the disputed period.  The grounds appear to  suggest  that
there was only dispute from 1997 to  1999  such  that  the Judge  erred  in
stating the disputed period was from 1997 to 2004.  In fact, the  respondent
in reaching the decision under appeal had not accepted  that  the  appellant
had demonstrated he had been in the UK from 1997 to 2005.

14.  There are then some further arguments  as  contained  in  the  skeleton
argument referred to above.  I had wondered whether  the  skeleton  argument
sought to make new points not covered in the grounds, which it seemed to  me
would have been impermissible without a successful application to amend  the
grounds, but Mr Bates indicated, very fairly, that he would accept that the
skeleton argument simply built upon what was contained within  the  grounds.
Accordingly, it did not seem to me given that stance that any amendment  was
necessary.  Turning  then  to  the  skeleton  argument,  this  contains  the
contention that the Judge had erred in applying a higher standard of  proof
than he was permitted to apply.  That is something  which  was  restated  in
the oral submissions of Miss Rahman.  The real point made as to this,  both
in the skeleton argument and in the oral submissions, concerned the Judge's
treatment of the DVD evidence  and  what  he  said  about  that  appears  at
paragraphs 38, 39 and 40 of the determination as set out above.

15.  Of course, the standard of proof is that of a balance of  probabilities
and the burden of proof was upon the  appellant.   The Judge  set  out  the
correct  standard  and  indeed  burden  of  proof  at  paragraph 1  of  his
determination.  He said correctly:

         "The Appellant must satisfy me on the balance of probabilities  the
         relevant requirements of the Rules are met."

16.  It is difficult to see how it can properly be argued that,  given  that
the Judge had correctly identified the relevant standard of proof, he would
subsequently lose sight of it.  His concern regarding the DVD  evidence  was
to the effect, as he  stated  at  paragraph 38,  that  it  was  impossible,
without other evidence, to verify the accuracy of  the  dates  appearing  on
the footage.  In my judgment it was open to the Judge to take that view and
to decide, in consequence, that no or only limited weight could be  attached
to the DVD evidence.  Whilst the appellant may  disagree  with  the Judge's
approach  it  was  not  irrational  or  perverse  and,  notwithstanding  the
submissions of Miss Rahman, the mere fact that he took that approach to the
evidence does  not  demonstrate  that  he  was  somehow  applying  a  higher
standard of proof than the one he had correctly identified at the outset  of
the determination.

17.  There was then the point made in the  skeleton  argument  that  it  was
highly improbable that the appellant having entered the  UK  in  1993  would
have left unlawfully and then returned unlawfully shortly afterwards.   That
is, indeed, a point which had  independently  occurred  to  myself  and  one
which I raised with Mr Bates at the hearing.  His response was that it  was
not at all unheard of for persons to enter the UK  illegally,  exit  the  UK
illegally and then return.  The Judge did have evidence before him to  show
that the appellant had, in all probability, been in the UK from  1993  to  a
date in 1997 and, indeed, that was accepted by the  respondent.   The Judge
also had documentary evidence which tended to  suggest  that  the  appellant
had been in the UK from  a  date  sometime  in  2000.   Though  he  did  not
expressly say so it does appear that it was the evidence from 1997  to  2000
which he found to be insufficiently  persuasive  to  reach  the  balance  of
probabilities test.  Ordinarily, one might think that it  would  be  unusual
for an appellant to unlawfully  enter  in  1993,  leave  in  1997  and  then
unlawfully re-enter in 2000.  However, I do not think it can  be  said  that
the Judge's approach in this regard was perverse or irrational or that  the
scenario was so  improbable  as  to  require  the Judge,  despite  evidence
tending to damage the credibility of the appellant, to accept  that  he  had
been in the UK throughout the relevant period.

18.  Turning to the oral submissions, some of the points made or  reiterated
in those submissions have already been dealt with  because  they  were  also
raised  in  the  written  material.   Miss Rahman,  though,  stressed  her
contention that the Judge had erred in failing to consider the evidence  as
a composite whole and, in particular, that he  had  reached  a  view  as  to
credibility first of all and had only  then  gone  on  to  consider  whether
there was other evidence to offset  that  adverse  credibility  view.   That
approach was said to be wrong in light of the  judgment  in  Mibanga v The
Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 367.  In Mibanga
the Court of Appeal was considering the proper approach to  be  taken  by  a
fact finder such as a first instance judge where there was expert  evidence.
 It was contended in that case that a  judge  had  erred  by  first  of  all
considering  the  appellant's  evidence  and  then  considering  whether  an
adverse conclusion reached  about  it  should  be  altered  because  of  the
content of some expert evidence.  At paragraph 24 of the Judgment this  was
said:

         "24. It seems to me to be axiomatic that  a  fact-finder  must  not
             reach his or her conclusion before surveying all the  evidence
             relevant  thereto.   Just  as,  if  I  may  take  a  banal  if
             alliterative example, one cannot make a  cake  with  only  one
             ingredient, so also frequently one cannot make a case, in  the
             sense of establishing its truth, otherwise than by combination
             of a number of pieces of evidence.  Mr Tam, on behalf of  the
             Secretary  of  State,  argues  that  decisions   as   to   the
             credibility of an account are to be taken by the judicial fact-
             finder  and  that,  in  their  reports,  experts,  whether  in
             relation to medical  matters  or  in  relation  to  in-country
             circumstances, cannot  usurp  the  fact-finder's  function  in
             assessing credibility.  I  agree.   What,  however,  they  can
             offer, is a factual context in which it may be  necessary  for
             the fact-finder to survey the allegations placed  before  him;
             and such context may prove  a  crucial  aid  to  the  decision
             whether or not to accept the truth of them.   What  the  fact-
             finder does at his peril is to reach a conclusion by reference
             only to the appellant's evidence and then, if it be  negative,
             to ask whether the conclusion should be shifted by the  expert
             evidence ..."

19.  Here, we are not concerned  with  expert  evidence.   There  was  none.
Miss Rahman's contention is that, from paragraph 35 of  the  determination
the Judge was taking, as she put it, "the documents in turn to  see  if  it
should displace his credibility view".  I do not think that the comments  in
Mibanga which Miss Rahman relies upon are applicable  because,  as  I  say,
this was not a case which concerned the correct  approach  to  be  taken  to
expert evidence.  Additionally and in any event, all the Judge  was  doing,
on my reading, from paragraphs 32 to 34 of the  decision  was  setting  out
matters  of  credibility  which  concerned  him.   He  was  entitled  to  be
concerned about the matters he identified and,  his  having  been  concerned
about them, he had to  set  them  out.  I  would  accept  that  the  closing
sentence of paragraph 34 does seem to suggest that the Judge  had  adopted
the approach Miss Rahman says he did and which she then criticises him  for
but, whilst the content of that sentence is  in  this  context  unfortunate,
the determination does have to be read as a whole.  When that  is  done,  it
may be seen that what  is  said  up  to  paragraph 34  is  the  appropriate
identification of concerns regarding  credibility  and  what  is  said  from
paragraph 35 is a consideration of aspects of the evidence presented by the
appellant before a final view was taken that the  appellant's  evidence,  as
to what was,  in  the  view  of  the  judge  the  crucial  period,  was  not
sufficiently reliable to be accepted.

20.  Miss Rahman did seek to make some additional points during the  course
of her oral submissions which really represented  either  disagreement  with
the Judge's conclusions on the evidence or different  ways  of  looking  at
such evidence.  However, it was for the Judge to consider the evidence  and
to attach whatever weight he thought was appropriate to it.  A  disagreement
with his interpretation of the evidence and with his findings does  not,  of
itself, demonstrate legal error.

21.  In  light  of  all  of  the  above,  whilst  I  do  not  say  that  the
determination lacks imperfections, when it is read as a whole it is free  of
legal error.  The Judge's findings were adequately explained and were  open
to him on the material before him.  He did  not  misunderstand  or  misapply
the law.  In light of the above his determination shall stand.
