                        DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. This is an appeal against the decision, promulgated on 18 March 2015,
       of First-tier Tribunal Judge Hunter (hereinafter referred to as the
       FTTJ).




 Background

    2. The appellant was last granted leave to remain in the United  Kingdom
       as a Tier 4 (General) migrant until 11  April  2014.  His  leave  was
       subsequently curtailed until 17 November 2013. On  15  November  2013
       the appellant sought further leave to remain in order to study for  a
       CMI Level 8 diploma in Strategic Direction and Leadership at Bradford
       Regional College. That application was refused on 4 April 2014 as the
       appellant's bank statement was not  accepted  as  evidence  of  funds
       because the respondent was of the view that it had been proven to  be
       false. The application was refused under paragraph  245ZX(d)  of  the
       Immigration Rules because the respondent  did  not  accept  that  the
       appellant was in possession of a total of ï¿½2,600 for his  outstanding
       course fees and living costs and therefore no  points  were  awarded.
       Additionally, the application was refused under paragraph 322(1A)  of
       HC 395. The respondent asserted that the appellant had  no  right  of
       appeal against that decision, however a duty FTTJ  decided  otherwise
       and the matter proceeded to an appeal hearing.


    3. At the hearing before the FTTJ, the appellant appeared in person  and
       gave evidence about his finances in Pakistan. The respondent produced
       an attachment to a document verification report  on  the  appellant's
       financial documents on the day of the hearing. The FTTJ found that he
       was not satisfied that the appellant had provided  a  false  document
       owing to a lack of  detail  and  discrepancies  in  the  bank  letter
       attached to the document verification report. Nonetheless, he went on
       to conclude that the appellant  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of
       paragraph 245ZX(a) of the Rules  because  he  found  the  appellant's
       documents  to  be  unreliable,  albeit  not  false.  The  appeal  was
       dismissed under the Immigration Rules and also under Article 8  ECHR,
       both within and outside the Rules.

    4. The grounds of application argue, that the decision of the  FTTJ  was
       irrational and that it was unfair of him to dismiss the appeal if  he
       found that the appellant had  not  used  deception.  It  was  further
       argued that the appeal should either have been allowed or remitted to
       the respondent for a fresh decision.

    5. Permission  was  granted  on  the  above  basis.  The  FTTJ  granting
       permission remarked that it was arguable  that  the  FTTJ's  decision
       fell into irrationality and that he ought to have remitted  the  case
       to the respondent for a fresh decision under the Rules.


    6. The Secretary of State lodged a Rule 24 response  on  11  June  2015.
       Essentially, the respondent argued that  the  FTTJ  directed  himself
       appropriately; that the respondent failed to discharge the burden  of
       proving the documents were false did not lead to a finding  that  the
       documents were genuine  and  that  there  was  nothing  incompatible,
       perverse or unreasonable in the FTTJ concluding  that  the  appellant
       had failed to establish that the documents could be given  sufficient
       weight to discharge the burden upon him.


    7. At the  hearing  before  us,  the  appellant  was  unrepresented.  He
       reiterated that he had spoken to his bank in Pakistan  and  they  had
       told him that the staff in the branch had made an error. He  told  us
       that the bank was unable to verify his account  at  the  respondent's
       request but that this did not mean that his documents were false.  He
       had been attempting to obtain confirmation in writing from the  bank,
       however he was experiencing some difficulties in doing this from  the
       United Kingdom. Ms Fijiwala showed the appellant her  copies  of  the
       bank documents, which were before the FTTJ. These  clearly  showed  a
       date of 30 October 2013.

    8. We noted that the copies of the National  Savings  Centre  documents,
       which were before the FTTJ had part of the year missing owing to poor
       photocopying in the respondent's bundle of  evidence.  The  appellant
       told us that the issue of the date of these documents was not  raised
       by the FTTJ during the hearing.

    9. Ms Fijiwala relied on the Rule 24 response. She  submitted  that  the
       FTTJ  gave  good  reasons  for  finding  that  the  appellant's  bank
       documents were not reliable. She referred  to  paragraph  27  of  the
       decision and reasons referred to inconsistent evidence given  by  the
       appellant. She argued that the FTTJ ought to have sent it back to the
       respondent for reconsideration. Ms Fijiwala confirmed that there  was
       no cross appeal relating to the FTTJ's finding on the deception issue
       and that the funds shown in the  National  Savings  Centre  documents
       were more than enough to meet the  maintenance  requirements  of  the
       Rules.

   10. After rising to consider the matter, we informed the parties that  we
       had found a material error of law in the decision of the  FTTJ,  that
       being  that  his  conclusions  on  the  appellant's  documents   were
       bordering on the irrational. We therefore set aside his  decision  in
       relation to the reliability of the appellant's documents.  There  was
       no error in relation to his finding that the respondent had failed to
       discharge the burden of proof  upon  her  to  establish  the  use  of
       deception in the appellant's application. Our reasons are as follows.

   11. We noted the appellant's submission that his finances were strong and
       that he could provide  a  letter  from  the  bank  if  necessary.  Ms
       Fijiwala conceded that the date had been  erroneously  left  off  the
       appellant's documents and that the serial numbers of the certificates
       could be identified in the appellant's bank statement. She  asked  us
       to note what the FTTJ said regarding the appellant's account  of  his
       finances being "a little confusing," which she  accepted  was  not  a
       damning indictment. This was the only matter she could point us to.

   12. There was only one issue before the  FTTJ,  that  being  whether  the
       appellant had relied upon false  documents  in  his  application  for
       further leave  to  remain.  Having  found  that  this  had  not  been
       established, the FTTJ erred in dismissing the  appeal  on  the  basis
       that he could not rely upon the appellant's  documents.  We  consider
       his findings to be irrational. We find that the FTTJ  ought  to  have
       simply allowed the appeal after deciding the deception issue.

   13. We also find that the reasons given  by  the  FTTJ  for  finding  the
       appellant's documents to be unreliable do not stand up  to  scrutiny.
       The  first  reason  given  was   that   the   appellant   had   given
       "contradictory  evidence."  Yet,  the  FTTJ  does  not  identify  the
       contradictions and at paragraph 21 of the decision  and  reasons,  he
       describes the appellant's oral evidence only as "a little confusing."
       We find that the FTTJ's confusion regarding when the appellant's bank
       account was opened, which according to  paragraph  21,  was  resolved
       during  the  appellant's  oral   evidence,   does   not   amount   to
       "inconsistencies." As indicated above, Ms Fijiwala was unable to  say
       much more about this part of the reasons.

   14. The second reason provided by the FTTJ for  finding  the  appellant's
       bank documents to be unreliable  was  that  he  had  been  unable  to
       ascertain to whom the certificates were issued.  As  accepted  by  Ms
       Fijiwala, the serial numbers shown on the certificates were listed on
       the appellant's National Savings Centre bank statement and  thus  the
       information ascertainable on the certificates is consistent with  the
       other bank documents.

   15. The third and final reason given  by  the  FTTJ  is  the  lack  of  a
       complete date on the bank letter and statement. As  indicated  above,
       the copies the appellant provided with his application were complete;
       evidenced by the complete scanned copies printed off the respondent's
       database by Ms Fijiwala for the hearing before us.

   16. The appellant was not at fault for the poorly copied documents before
       the FTTJ and it is unfair to criticise his documents for that reason.
       We heard  no  other  submission  as  to  why  we  should  reject  the
       appellant's National Savings Centre documentation and having examined
       the documents for ourselves, could see no reason to do so.

   17. We could see no reason why we should not simply remake  the  decision
       and after inviting further submissions from the parties we did so.

   18. We accordingly find that the appellant did not use deception  in  the
       application and that he provided reliable evidence of his funds. That
       evidence showed that the full date was provided on the documents, the
       certificates corresponded to the other bank documents and that  there
       were no significant inconsistencies in the appellant's oral evidence.




 Conclusions

    1) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the
       making of an error on a point of law.

    2) We set aside the decision.

    3) We remake the decision by allowing the appeal under the Immigration
       Rules.
