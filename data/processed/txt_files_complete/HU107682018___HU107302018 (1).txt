Representation:
For the Appellant:      Ms A Harvey of Counsel instructed by AY & J
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:     Mr N Bramble of the Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellants

 1. The Appellants are husband and wife. They have two minor children  born
    in 2015 and 2018. The Appellants are Indian citizens, born respectively
    on 30 November 1982 and 20 August 1990.

 2. On 9 September 2007 the husband entered the United Kingdom  with  entry
    clearance as a student. He was granted further leave as a  Tier  (Post-
    Study Worker) migrant and subsequently granted further leave as a  Tier
    1 (General) migrant which was extended to expire on 13 June 2016.

 3. The Appellants married on 8 December 2012 in India and the wife entered
    on 10 August 2013  under  the  Points-Based  Scheme  as  the  husband's
    dependant. Both children were born in the United Kingdom.

 4. On 10 June 2016 the husband applied for indefinite leave to remain as a
    Tier 1 (General) migrant and three days  later  the  wife  applied  for
    leave as his dependant.

The SSHD's decisions

 5. The Respondent (the SSHD) refused the husband's application on 7  April
    2018 by reference to paragraphs 276B  and  322(5)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules and the wife's application  on  30  April  2018  under  paragraph
    276ADE(1) and  Appendix  FM,  surprisingly  without  reference  to  the
    refusal of the husband's application.

 6. The SSHD noted that the  husband's  tax  returns  showed  that  he  had
    reported to HM Revenue & Customs an income for the tax  year  ending  5
    April 2011 lower than he had declared in his  application  of  4  April
    2011 to the SSHD for further leave. This led the SSHD to  conclude  the
    husband had been deceitful and dishonest in his dealings with  HMRC  or
    the SSHD or  both  which  indicated  character  or  conduct  making  it
    undesirable to grant him indefinite leave to remain.

 7. The SSHD came to this conclusion because for the year  ending  5  April
    2011 the Applicant had submitted a tax return showing a total income of
    �16,665 which was significantly lower  than  the  earnings  of  �36,346
    claimed in his application of 04 April 2011 for further leave under the
    Points-Based System.

Proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal

 8. The Appellants appealed and by a decision promulgated  on  27  December
    2018 Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Rhys-Davies  dismissed  both
    appeals on all grounds.

 9. The Appellants sought permission to appeal on the basis the  Judge  had
    erred in law. The grounds referred to the explanation of dishonesty  in
    the judgment in R (Khan) v SSHD [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC).  The  Judge  was
    said to have found the husband's explanation plausible and to have  not
    taken adequately into account that the  husband  had  amended  his  tax
    return and paid the additional tax due.  The  Judge  had  not  made  an
    express finding the husband had been dishonest.

10. The grounds argue the  Judge  had  erred  in  rejecting  the  husband's
    explanation partly because he had not  produced  bank  statements  from
    January 2012, had not  adequately  taken  into  account  the  husband's
    account of when he had been depressed and that the wife had not been in
    a position to vouch for the relevant period  because  it  was  in  part
    prior to their marriage and for a period before she had joined  him  in
    the United Kingdom.

11. The Judge had found it plausible the husband may have been a victim  of
    fraud in relation to his first tax return and had thereafter speculated
    as to his future behaviour at paragraph 68 of his decision.

The Upper Tribunal Proceedings

12.   The  Appellants  renewed  their  permission  applications  on  similar
    grounds to the Upper Tribunal. On 26 February 2019 Upper Tribunal Judge
    Hemingway granted permission because it was arguable that the Judge had
    erred in his understanding of the relationship of the periods when  the
    husband stated that he was suffering from depression and when he  dealt
    with his tax return and further leave application.

13.  The Appellants and  their  younger  child  attended.  I  explained  the
    purpose and procedure to be adopted at an Error of Law hearing and  the
    Appellants took no active part in the hearing.

14.  The Response given pursuant to Procedure Rule 24 by the  SSHD  asserted
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge having accepted the plausibility  of  the
    husband's account to have been an innocent victim, nevertheless went on
    to find there were factors that  undermined  the  plausibility  of  the
    account and was justified in his adverse  credibility  findings.  There
    had been a lack of satisfactory medical  evidence  to  corroborate  the
    husband's claims to have had mental health issues since  2011  and  the
    Judge had found the evidence of each  of  the  Appellants  about  these
    issues to  be  inconsistent.  The  Judge  had  been  justified  in  his
    conclusions.

Submissions for the Appellants

15.  Ms Harvey stated she was not relying on all  the  grounds  for  appeal.
    She referred to the headnote to R  (Khan)  and  submitted  the  Judge's
    findings of fact did not justify his conclusion that  the  husband  had
    been dishonest. With reference to the payments to his first tax adviser
    to whom it was alleged had ill-served him, the  husband  had  not  been
    requested by his advisers to produce evidence by way of bank statements
    of payment to the tax adviser.

16.  The evidence was the husband had been depressed since January 2012.  He
    had married on 8 December 2012. It was an arranged marriage.  The  wife
    would not have been in a position to know and understand her  husband's
    mental issues until she had joined him in August 2013. There  had  been
    no dishonesty in relation to his mental issues.

17.  The Judge's comments at paragraph 68 of his decision  were  speculative
    and unsupported by any adequate reasoning.

18.  The application of paragraph 322(5) require the exercise of  discretion
    which the Judge had not considered. His decision was flawed and  should
    be set aside.

19.  I noted to Ms Harvey  that  there  had  been  no  application  for  the
    submission of further evidence. She informed me the husband had applied
    for a copy of his GP records but further time was  required  to  obtain
    the full records and the husband had not made any applications for  the
    missing bank statements from 2012.

Submissions for the SSHD

20.  Mr Bramble relied on the response given under Procedure  Rule  24.  The
    grounds for appeal which had been pursued all related to a challenge to
    the Judge's treatment of the husband's evidence. It was notable that no
    application had been made to submit further evidence.

21.  The Judge had been entitled to rely on the failure to produce the  bank
    statements which could have  supported  the  husband's  claim  to  have
    withdrawn cash to pay the first accountant by whom  he  had  been  ill-
    served. The statements had not been produced for  the  hearing  in  the
    Upper Tribunal. This was hardly a new issue as  indeed  the  Judge  had
    specifically commented on their absence and they would be  evidence  to
    support what the husband had claimed. Much the same could  be  said  in
    relation to the absence of the husband's notes held by his GP  referred
    to at paragraphs 41 and 72 of the Judge's decision.

22.  The letter at Section G  of  the  SSHD's  bundle  from  Dr  Ravani  was
    retrospective, confirming treatment from 02 July 2013 to 02 May 2015. I
    noted that the copies of the prescriptions issued  by  Dr  Ravani  were
    dated to July and October 2014.

23.  The husband's  mental  health  issues  were  a  central  plank  of  his
    explanation how the error in his  tax  return  arose,  as  set  out  at
    paragraph 13 of the  skeleton  argument  before  the  Judge.  The  same
    paragraph referred to the payments to the first accountant.  The  Judge
    had adopted the correct approach to the application of the learning  in
    R(Khan):  the  husband's  innocent  explanation  did  not  satisfy  the
    relevant test which the Judge had identified at  paragraph  63  of  his
    decision.

24.  The grounds for appeal referred to the exercise of  discretion  in  the
    application of paragraph 322(5) as part of the challenge to the Judge's
    proportionality assessment. The Judge had assessed  proportionality  at
    paragraphs 89-92 of his decision which should be upheld.

Response for the Appellants

25.  Ms Harvey stated she had been instructed that the first accountant  had
    been paid in cash which had been withdrawn from the bank over a  period
    of time and that the relevant bank statements could be submitted.

26.  The husband  had  probably  been  in  India  in  2014  and  so  it  was
    reasonable that the evidence of Dr Nirvani should date from  then.  The
    Judge had erred at paragraph 74 in relying on  apparently  inconsistent
    evidence given by the wife about the husband's mental health issues  to
    make an adverse credibility finding, given the timing of  the  relevant
    application for further leave and filing of 2010/11 tax return.

27.  The Judge  had  failed  to  consider  the  exercise  of  discretion  at
    paragraph 76 of his decision. The decision should be set aside.

Consideration

28.  I find the Judge did not give adequate reasoning at paragraphs  74  and
    75 of his decision  to  support  his  adverse  credibility  finding  in
    respect of the husband because of the wife's evidence (or lack  of  it)
    about his mental issues prior to their marriage or her arrival  in  the
    United Kingdom. I also find  that  paragraph  75  adds  little  to  the
    decision  other  than  speculation  intended  to  support  an   adverse
    credibility finding. This is  so  particularly  in  the  light  of  the
    Judge's findings about the plausibility of the husband's account.

29.  For these reasons, I find the  Judge's  decision  contains  a  material
    error of law such that it should be  set  aside.  At  the  hearing  the
    parties agreed that if I found  there  was  an  error  of  law  in  the
    decision I might proceed to deal with the substantive  appeal  in  this
    decision.

30.  The burden of proof is on the Appellants and the standard of  proof  is
    the civil standard; that is on the balance of  probabilities.  Evidence
    subsequent to the date of decision may be  taken  into  account.  Where
    fraud or deceit is alleged by the SSHD, the initial burden of proof  is
    on the SSHD.

31.  I am satisfied the SSHD has discharge the evidential  burden  of  proof
    by reason of the differences  in  the  income  for  2010/11  which  the
    husband declared in his application for further leave of 4  April  2011
    and his 2010/11 tax return filed in January 2012 and amended  not  long
    before his application for indefinite leave  leading  to  the  decision
    under appeal.

32.  The Appellants knew from the  reasons  for  refusal  of  the  husband's
    application that the SSHD had concerns about both the incomes  declared
    in the indefinite leave application and in the 2011 tax  return.  There
    is no evidence to confirm the income disclosed in the indefinite  leave
    application of 4 April 2011. The husband has accepted that the 2011 tax
    return was inaccurate. He seeks to explain this by alleging that he was
    defrauded by his then accountant. He claimed he  had  withdrawn  in  or
    about January 2012 in a single transaction a sum of at least  �5490  to
    pay the accountant and meet his tax liability: see paragraph 7  of  the
    husband's statement of  7  November  2018..  There  is  no  documentary
    evidence to support this explanation which is one of  the  two  central
    planks of the husband's appeal. At the hearing before me,  his  Counsel
    reported that his instructions were that the cash  withdrawals  to  pay
    this accountant had been made over a period of time.

33.  I refer to the tax calculation summary of 8 June 2016  issued  by  HMRC
    at Section F of the SSHD's bundle. The husband on one version states he
    paid his then accountant in January 2012 �5490. The tax due  for  which
    that money was supposed to be paid remained  outstanding  from  January
    2012 until after June 2016. The husband has given no explanation how he
    remained unaware that the tax due  on  his  2011  tax  return  remained
    outstanding for more than four years without the husband receiving some
    communication from HMRC about a failure to lodge a tax return or demand
    for payment of tax. If he had been defrauded, there was no  explanation
    why the only evidence of police involvement is an e-mail of 22  October
    2017 (some five years after the claimed loss of �5490) from the  police
    referred to in  Section  B  of  the  Appellant's'  bundle  but  despite
    reference to it in the index to the bundle it is not to be found. It is
    not unreasonable to have expected more energy to have been spent by the
    husband even if he was under stress and depressed  in  pursuing  a  not
    inconsiderable sum of money of which he claimed to have been defrauded.

33.  The second central  plank  of  the  appeal  is  the  husband's  claimed
    depression and stress which started in 2010 and was continuing  at  the
    time of the preparation and filing of the 2011 tax  return  in  January
    2012. Other than mere assertion and evidence of medical treatment  from
    9 July 2013, some one and a half years after the 2011  tax  return  had
    been filed, there was no evidence to support the claim. The absence  of
    evidence was explained by reference to difficulties  in  obtaining  the
    GP's records. The husband had relied on his mental health issues  since
    16 May 2017 when interviewed: see Section H of  the  SSHD's  bundle  at
    reply 34. He has had ample time to obtain the  requisite  corroborative
    evidence.  For  the  sake  of  completeness,  I  should  add  that  the
    Appellant's' bundle contains in addition to  Dr  Nirvani's  letter  and
    prescription correspondence from Dr Quadir Quraishi in the form of  two
    letters both dated 1 June 2016 referring to treatment for enteric fever
    (Typhoon) for the period 25  November  2013-20  January  2014  with  an
    accompanying medical certificate issued by Dr  A  Tungekar  for  a  not
    dissimilar period.

34.  I refer to the guidance given at paragraph 37 of R (Khan):

         (i)  Where there has been  a  significant  difference  between  the
         income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain  and
         the income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is entitled  to
         draw  an  inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been  deceitful  or
         dishonest and therefore he should be refused ILR  within  paragraph
         322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  I would expect the  Secretary  of
         State  to  draw  that  inference  where  there  is   no   plausible
         explanation for the discrepancy.

         (ii) However, where an Applicant has  presented  evidence  to  show
         that, despite the  prima  facie  inference,  he  was  not  in  fact
         dishonest but  only  careless,  then  the  Secretary  of  State  is
         presented with a fact-finding task: she  must  decide  whether  the
         explanation and evidence is sufficient, in her  view,  to  displace
         the prima facie inference of deceit/dishonesty.

         (iii)    In approaching that fact-finding task,  the  Secretary  of
         State should remind herself that, although the standard of proof is
         the "balance of probability", a finding  that  a  person  has  been
         deceitful and dishonest in relation to his  tax  affairs  with  the
         consequence that he is denied settlement in this country is a  very
         serious finding with serious consequences.

         (iv)  However,  for  an  applicant  simply  to  blame  his  or  her
         accountant for an "error" in relation to the historical tax  return
         will not be the  end  of  the  matter:  far  from  it.   Thus,  the
         Secretary of State is entitled to  take  into  account  that,  even
         where an accountant has made  an  error,  the  accountant  will  or
         should have asked the tax payer to  confirm  that  the  return  was
         accurate and to have signed the tax  return,  and  furthermore  the
         Applicant will have known of his or  her  earnings  and  will  have
         expected to pay tax  thereon.   If,  realising  this  (or  wilfully
         shutting his eyes to the situation), the Applicant  has  not  taken
         steps within  a  reasonable  time  to  remedy  the  situation,  the
         Secretary of State may be entitled  to  conclude  either  that  the
         error was not simply the fault of the accountant or, alternatively,
         the Applicant's failure to remedy the situation itself justifies  a
         conclusion that he has been has been  deceitful  or  dishonest  and
         therefore he should be refused ILR within paragraph 322(5)  of  the
         Immigration Rules.

         (v)  Where an issue arises as to whether an error in relation to  a
         tax return has been dishonest or merely careless, the Secretary  of
         State  is  obliged  to  consider  the  evidence  pointing  in  each
         direction and, in her decision, justify her conclusion by reference
         to that evidence. In those circumstances, as long as the  reasoning
         is rational and the evidence  has  been  properly  considered,  the
         decision of the Secretary of State cannot be impugned.

         (vi)There will be legitimate questions for the Secretary  of  State
         to consider in reaching her decision in these cases, including (but
         these are by no means exclusive):

             i.   Whether the explanation for the error by  the  accountant
             is plausible;

             ii.  Whether the documentation which can be assumed  to  exist
             (for example, correspondence between  the  Applicant  and  his
             accountant at the time of the tax return) has  been  disclosed
             or there is a plausible explanation for why it is missing;

             iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had  been
             made because his liability to pay tax was less than he  should
             have expected;

             iv.  Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken  steps  to
             remedy the situation and, if so, when those steps  were  taken
             and the explanation for any significant delay.

         (vii)    In relation to any of the above matters, the Secretary  of
         State is likely to want to see  evidence  which  goes  beyond  mere
         assertion:  for example, in a case such as the  present  where  the
         explanation is that the Applicant was distracted by his concern for
         his son's health, there should be documentary  evidence  about  the
         matter.  If there is, then the Secretary of  State  would  need  to
         weigh up whether such concern genuinely  excuses  or  explains  the
         failure to account for tax, or at  least  displaces  the  inference
         that the Applicant has been deceitful/dishonest. The  Secretary  of
         State, before making her decision, should  call  for  the  evidence
         which she considers ought to exist, and may  draw  an  unfavourable
         inference from any failure on the part of the Applicant to  produce
         it.

         (viii)   In her decision, the Secretary of State should  articulate
         her reasoning, setting out the matters which  she  has  taken  into
         account in reaching her decision and stating the  reasons  for  the
         decision she has reached.

35.  For the reasons given, I find that the SSHD has shown  that  there  are
    grounds to engage paragraph 322(5) and applying the jurisprudence in  R
    (Khan), the husband has failed to displace the inference  of  deceitful
    or dishonest behaviour. Such evidence as  would  likely  to  have  been
    sufficient to  displace  the  inference  could  have  been  easily  and
    inexpensively obtained. The proffered explanations are for the  reasons
    given inadequate. Additionally, there are the apparent discrepancies or
    omissions in the husband's claims in relation to  the  preparation  and
    filing of the 2011 tax return evidence.

36.  Looking at the various claims made by the husband and the  evidence  or
    lack of evidence and the explanations for such lack and what  was  said
    in R(Khan), I am satisfied the SSHD has  shown  it  was  reasonable  to
    refuse the husband's application  by  way  of  reference  to  paragraph
    322(5) of the Immigration Rules and the husband has failed to show that
    in all the circumstances it would be  disproportionate  to  refuse  his
    claim for indefinite leave based on long residence.

37.  The  wife  cannot  meet  any  of  the  time  critical  requirements  of
    paragraph 276 ADE(1) of the Immigration Rules. The husband's appeal has
    been dismissed. I note the wife lived in India until she  came  to  the
    United Kingdom in 2013 after her marriage in 2012 and that there was no
    evidence to show there are  very  significant  obstacles  to  her  re--
    integration on return to India where she has family. It  would  not  be
    disproportionate to expect her to return to India with the husband.

38.  The Appellants have two children, born in the United  Kingdom  in  2015
    and 2018. They are sufficiently young not to have developed any private
    life outside the context of their parents. Their best interests are  to
    remain with their parents and I find it reasonable to expect them to go
    with their parents to settle in India where they have extended family.

39.  The appeal of each of the  Appellants  is  dismissed  on  human  rights
    grounds.

Anonymity

40.  There was no request for an anonymity direction and  having  considered
    the appeal, I find none is warranted.
