                          (ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE)

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:
Appellant   Mr Saeed (Legal Representative)
Respondent  Mr Mangion (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. I make an anonymity order under rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended) in  the  light
       of the sensitive matters raised in this appeal arising  out  of  the
       appellant's international protection claim. This order prohibits the
       disclosure directly or indirectly (including by the parties) of  the
       identity of the appellant. Any disclosure in breach  of  this  order
       may amount to a contempt of court. This order shall remain in  force
       unless revoked or varied by a Tribunal or Court.

    2. The appellant is a citizen of  Kuwait.  He  arrived  in  the  United
       Kingdom on December 17, 2014 and he  claimed  asylum  the  following
       day. He was served with Form IS151A as an illegal  entrant.  On  May
       27, 2015 the respondent refused the appellant's asylum  claim  under
       paragraph 336 HC 395.

    3. The appellant appealed that decision on June 8, 2015  under  Section
       82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  and  the
       matter came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  McAll  on
       November 3, 2015.

    4. In a decision promulgated on November  16,  2015  he  dismissed  the
       appellant's refugee and human rights claims but allowed  his  appeal
       on humanitarian protections grounds.

    5. Both parties appealed the Judge's decision on November 30, 2015  and
       permission to appeal was granted to both parties  by  Judge  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal Osborne on December 17, 2015.

    6. The matter came before me on the above date.

PRELIMINARY ISSUE

    7. In  allowing  the  appellant's  appeal  on  humanitarian  protection
       grounds the Judge  found  that  having  read  the  country  guidance
       decision of AA (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2015] UKUT  00544  (IAC)  he
       noted the  issue  raised  was  both  complex  and  required  anxious
       scrutiny. Taking all of the circumstances of this case in the  round
       the Judge concluded  the  appellant  was  in  need  of  humanitarian
       protection.

    8. Mr Mangion relied on the grounds of appeal and  submitted  that  the
       Judge had erred in granting humanitarian protection  because  having
       stated the complex and required anxious scrutiny he then  failed  to
       give any reasons  for  finding  the  appellant  needed  humanitarian
       protection. Mr Mangion submitted the respondent had the  appellant's
       passport details and this would enable him to obtain a new  passport
       or a laissez passer. As return was feasible it was incumbent on  the
       Judge to have considered the issue of return and by failing to do so
       he erred.

    9. Mr Saeed disputed  the  passport  details  held  by  the  respondent
       belonged to the appellant but he accepted it was difficult to  argue
       the Judge's approach was correct.

   10. The Tribunal made clear in AA that where return to Iraq was feasible
       the Judge would have to consider the alleged risk of  harm.  As  the
       Judge found the the appellant had a  valid  Iraqi  passport  it  was
       incumbent upon the Judge to then consider the issue of risk  and  if
       there was a risk of harm then he should give reasons. This he failed
       to do and accordingly the respondent's grounds of appeal  has  merit
       and in those circumstances I find the Judge erred in  allowing  this
       appeal on humanitarian protection grounds and I  set  that  decision
       aside.

   11. I indicated to the  parties  that  I  would  then  hear  submissions
       regarding the appellant's cross appeal.

SUBMISSIONS

   12. Mr Saeed submitted that the Judge's finding that the  appellant  was
       an Iraqi national as against an undocumented Bidoon was  irrational.
       The evidence about the passport itself was contained in an  unsigned
       statement and the witness had not been called to give evidence.  The
       Judge erred by attaching weight to that statement.

   13. The appellant's claim was he was  an  undocumented  Bidoon  and  the
       Judge failed to attach sufficient weight to the evidence adduced  by
       him. In particular, the Judge had evidence from his half-brother. He
       had been accepted as an undocumented Bidoon and the  Judge  accepted
       they shared the same father. The Judge accepted he had  been  living
       in Kuwait, the appellant had married in Kuwait  in  the  1990's  and
       that his father had a residence document and evidence he was a guard
       for the Ministry of Interior in Kuwait and so his  finding  that  he
       was able to obtain Iraqi nationality was irrational.

   14. The only document the Judge relied on for finding the appellant  was
       able to obtain Iraqi nationality was a document that  had  not  been
       before him. That evidence had to be considered against  all  of  the
       other evidence about the appellant, his half-brother and father  and
       if the Judge had properly considered the evidence then he would  not
       have found he was an Iraqi national. The  appellant's  half  brother
       was accepted as an  undocumented  Bidoon  and  it  therefore  lacked
       credibility that the appellant, who shared the same father, was not.



   15. Mr Mangion submitted the Judge's findings were open to him.  He  had
       carefully analysed all of the evidence and  had  given  reasons  for
       distinguishing between  the  appellant  and  his  half-brother.  His
       reasons for finding the appellant was entitled to an Iraqi  passport
       was clearly open to him because he had concluded he had obtained his
       citizenship between 2006 and the date he came to the United Kingdom.
       The Judge found his father fitted the  profile,  identified  in  the
       article referred to in paragraph [28] of his decision, of  a  person
       moving to Iraq as a migrant worker.


DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

   16. In granting permission to appeal Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       Osborne found it arguable, in an  otherwise  detailed  and  focussed
       decision, that  the  Judge  had  erred  in  positively  finding  the
       Appellant  was  an  Iraqi  national  in  circumstances   where   the
       appellant's father's nationality  and  half-brother's  national  was
       Kuwaiti.
   17. In assessing whether the Judge  erred  I  have  had  regard  to  the
       Judge's full decision, the submissions made today,  the  grounds  of
       appeal and the documents before the Judge.

   18. In opposing the application Mr Mangion  appeared  to  be  submitting
       that there was no dispute that at  sometime  the  appellant  was  an
       undocumented Bidoon as was his father and half-brother but  sometime
       between 2006 and  the  date  he  came  to  the  United  Kingdom  the
       appellant gained Iraqi nationality and was therefore  no  longer  an
       undocumented Bidoon because he could be returned to Iraq.

   19. The Judge found his asylum account to  lack  credibility  and  those
       findings have not been appealed.

   20. Crucial to the appellant's appeal therefore is whether  the  judge's
       finding on his Iraqi nationality was  irrational  as  Mr  Saeed  has
       submitted.

   21. The Judge came to the conclusion he was an Iraqi national because:

      a. He made an application from Baghdad for a visit  visa  in  his  own
         name on May 20, 2013.


      b. A witness statement confirms the visa application was made  by  him
         as the photograph and fingerprints matched the appellant's.

      c. The Judge rejected his claim that he had travelled with an agent to
         Iraq to obtain a visa and found  his  answers  in  his  substantive
         interview did not support his explanation of how and why he went to
         Iraq.

      d. The Judge found his explanation at the hearing about who funded his
         trip to Iraq  to  lack  any  credibility  and  that  the  appellant
         fabricated his account preferring to conceal the  truth  about  his
         application as he knew this would undermine his claim.

      e. Based on the Thigar Report (referred to in paragraph  [28]  of  the
         decision) the Judge identified a method by which a Kuwait Bidoon of
         Iraqi origins could acquire Iraqi nationality.

   22. Mr Saeed's submission is that whilst there were a number of  adverse
       findings against the appellant the  fact  remained  that  the  Judge
       failed to explain how the appellant  would  have  been  entitled  to
       obtain an Iraqi passport and thereby apply for a visa and  that  the
       appellant's explanation that it was an agent  who  arranged  it  all
       requires further  consideration  especially  as  the  procedure  for
       obtaining Iraqi citizenship was  not  straightforward  and  required
       evidence that the appellant's father was Iraqi and the only evidence
       before the Judge was that he was Kuwaiti.

   23. Having already accepted there is an error in  the  approach  to  the
       issue of humanitarian protection it seems to me that  the  issue  of
       whether he can be returned to Iraq must be connected to  whether  he
       was able to legally obtain an Iraqi passport.

   24. The Judge suspected that the appellant's brother may also have  been
       entitled to Iraqi nationality but as there was insufficient evidence
       before the Judge who heard the brother's appeal and knowledge  about
       a similar claim in relation to this appellant was clearly unknown to
       that Judge his brother's appeal was allowed.

   25. Additionally, was it enough to find he  cannot  be  an  undocumented
       Bidoon because he was able to travel  to  the  United  Kingdom  when
       undocumented Bidoons have little income.

   26. There are many issues that undermine the appellant's  claim  and  it
       was for these reasons that the  Judge  made  the  findings  he  did.
       However, for the reasons outlined in the  grounds  of  appeal  there
       remains unanswered questions which go to the core of  this  part  of
       the claim.

   27. Put simply I accept, just, that the Judge failed to explain how  the
       appellant would have been able to secure Iraqi nationality and  this
       undermines his decision as per the permission to appeal. I therefore
       find there is an error in law.

   28. I raised with the parties where this appeal should be heard  in  the
       event there was an error in law.

   29. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

      "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement
      Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
      Tribunal finds that the making of the decision concerned involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law, the Upper Tribunal may set aside
      the decision and, if it does so, must either remit  the  case  to  the
      First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)   or   proceed   (in
      accordance with relevant Practice Directions) to re-make the  decision
      under section 12(2)(b)(ii).


      The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed  to  re-
      make the decision, instead of remitting the  case  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:�


      a) the effect of the error has been to  deprive  a  party  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that
         party's case  to  be  put  to  and  considered  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal; or


      b) the nature  or  extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
         necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is
         such that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2,  it
         is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

      Remaking rather than remitting will nevertheless constitute the normal
      approach to determining appeals where an error of law is  found,  even
      if some further fact finding is necessary."

   30. Both parties agreed that the matter be remitted back to  the  First-
       tier on the basis fresh evidence would  be  needed.  I  agreed  with
       their submissions.

   31. Whilst I have considered preserving findings I feel that  to  do  so
       would undermine any Judge rehearing this matter. Any  Judge  hearing
       this matter will have to grapple with the following issues:

      a. Was the appellant an undocumented Bidoon or had he  obtained  Iraqi
         nationality?


      b. If the appellant's parents were Iraqi when and how did they  obtain
         Iraqi nationality?


      c. If the appellant had Iraqi nationality when and how did  he  obtain
         that nationality?


      d. The statement and documents from Matt Johnson confirm the appellant
         applied for a USA visa in Baghdad in 2013. How  did  the  appellant
         travel  to  Iraq  and  was  this  an  application  based  on  false
         documents?

      e. Who funded his trip to Iraq  and  subsequent  trip  to  the  United
         Kingdom?

      f.        If the appellant was an Iraqi citizen is  he  returnable  to
         Iraq and if so where would he be returned to?

   32. To assist the Judge hearing the appeal I  direct  that  the  parties
       serve skeleton arguments on these issues  and  that  such  arguments
       should be served on both the Tribunal and other party in  accordance
       with the current Procedural Rules.

DECISION

   33. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve
       the making of an error on a point of law. I set aside the decision.

   34. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  these
       issues to be addressed hearing under Section 12  of  the  Tribunals,
       Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

   35. The matter should be dealt with by a Judge other than Judge  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal McAll.
