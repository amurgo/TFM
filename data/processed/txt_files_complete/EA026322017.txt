DECISION AND REASONS

EXTEMPORE JUDGMENT  

Notice of the Extempore Decision  

	Rule 40(3) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (statutory instrument 2008/2698 as amended) applies to this decision.  

	This appeal concerned an EEA claim.  

	The parties were agreed that the judge fell into error for the reasons set out in the grant of permission to the point that the documents the FtTJ thought were absent, and which caused him to dismiss the appeal, were in fact available and the appeal should have been allowed.  

	By consent the appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed as follows:  

The First-tier Tribunal is infected by error of law and set aside;     

I remake the decision allowing the Appellant’s appeal on EEA grounds.  



No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD



As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is payable, I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no fee award for the following reason: none has been requested.
