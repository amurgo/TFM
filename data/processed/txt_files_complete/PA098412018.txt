                            DECISION AND REASONS

1     This is the appeal against the decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal JJ Maxwell dated 2 October 2018, dismissing  the  appellant's
      appeal against the decision of  the  respondent  dated  27  July  2018
      refusing his protection and human rights claim.

2     The appellant is a  national  of  Iran,  and  arrived  in  the  United
      Kingdom on or around 9 August 2017, when he was  aged  15.  He  sought
      protection on the grounds that Iranian border  guards  had  identified
      him and his father whilst they had been in the  process  of  smuggling
      alcohol on horseback from Iraq to Iran. The  convoy  of  smugglers  of
      which they formed part was shot at, injuring some  within  the  group,
      but the appellant  and  his  father  had  managed  to  run  away.  The
      appellant's father believed that they would both have been  identified
      as smugglers, and fearing punishment amounting  to  serious  harm,  he
      arranged for the appellant to leave Iran. He travelled with an  agent,
      ultimately arriving in the UK.

3     The appellant  was  interviewed  in  connection  with  his  protection
      claim, and provided a witness statement dated 22  March  2018.  On  27
      July 2018 the respondent refused  the  application,  suggesting  there
      were  certain  inconsistencies  or  implausible  factors  within   the
      appellant's account, but given the appellant's age, granted him  leave
      to remain until the age of 17 ï¿½.  The appellant appealed to the First-
      tier Tribunal against the decision to refuse the protection claim.

4     The matter came before the judge at the Manchester hearing  centre  on
      21 September 2018. The appellant gave oral evidence.

5     The judge dismissed the appeal, for reasons accurately  summarised  in
      the appellant's subsequent grounds of appeal as follows:

           (i) the ability of the appellant and his  father  to  evade  the
           Iranian border guards lacked credibility [32];

           (ii) purported inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence as to
           where he was when shot at by the border guards and the direction
           of fire [33]; and

           (iii) the ability of the appellant to leave the country the  day
           after the incident was implausible [34].

6     The appellant applied for permission to appeal  in  grounds  dated  16
      October 2018 arguing that the judge had erred in law:

           (i) when considering the credibility of the appellant's account,
           by failing to have proper regard to the appellant's evidence  as
           to both (a) the location of the appellant and  his  father  when
           the border guards opened fire, and (b) the direction from  which
           the gunfire came; and

           (ii) when considering the risk to the  appellant  as  a  Kurdish
           failed asylum seeker, failed to have adequate regard to  country
           evidence, including expert evidence.

7     Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Povey on 25 October 2018. Judge Povey  expressed  the  view  that  the
      judge's findings regarding the appellant's account of events  in  Iran
      were sufficiently well reasoned, but found merit in the second ground,
      relating to the assessment of risk of harm as a Kurdish failed  asylum
      seeker. However, permission was granted generally, and  the  appellant
      is thus entitled to rely on both grounds.

8     The appellant's grounds of appeal, drafted by  Ms  Smith  of  Counsel,
      who appeared before the judge, set out at paragraph [8]  a  record  of
      the  appellant's  evidence  said  to  have  been  given  in  a   cross
      examination, and it was argued that such evidence had not  been  taken
      properly into account. The papers available to me prior to the hearing
      contained only a single page of Ms Smith's  typed  note  of  evidence,
      which did not include the relevant extract,  and  did  not  contain  a
      signed statement of truth confirming the accuracy of the note.

9     Prior to the date of hearing, I caused a notice of  directions  to  be
      issue to the parties, informing them that I  lacked  a  full  note  of
      evidence from the appellant, and giving the following directions:

            "1 The Appellant shall by 4.00 pm Thursday 3rd of January 2019:

                 (i) confirm in writing to  the  Tribunal  ...  whether  any
                 further pages of Ms Smith's note of evidence were submitted
                 with the application for permission to appeal, and  if  so,
                 shall at the same time provide them by email and copy  that
                 material to the Respondent; and

                 (ii) confirm whether any statement of truth was made by  Ms
                 Smith as to the  accuracy  of  her  note  of  evidence  and
                 provided with the application for permission to appeal, and
                 if so, shall at the same time provide a copy of  the  same,
                 and provide a copy to the Respondent (and the  parties  are
                 reminded of the provisions of  BW  (witness  statements  by
                 advocates) [2014] UKUT 568 (IAC) (12 December 2014).

           2  The Respondent shall by  4.00  pm  Monday  7th  January  2019
           confirm in writing to  the  Tribunal  ...   and  copied  to  the
           Appellant:

                 (i) whether the Respondent raises any material  dispute  as
                 to the content of Ms Smith's note of evidence; and

                 (ii) whether the Respondent has any objection to  Ms  Smith
                 acting as advocate in the proceedings.

           3 In light of the Respondent's  response,  the  Appellant  shall
           make arrangements for representation at the hearing  on  10.1.19
           which are compliant with BW (witness  statements  by  advocates)
           [2014] UKUT 568.

10    I was subsequently provided with a full copy of  Ms  Smith's  note  of
      evidence. Mr Tan, for the Respondent, also confirmed in  writing  that
      he had received a full copy of Ms Smith's  note,  and  having  crossed
      referred it to the note of evidence taken by Mr Townsend, who appeared
      before the judge, Mr Tan confirmed that the respondent did  not  raise
      any material dispute as to the content of Counsel's note of  evidence.
      Therefore, although Ms Smith's note was not accompanied by a statement
      of truth that it represented an accurate note of evidence, there is no
      dispute as to its content.

11    At the hearing before me, the appellant was in fact represented by  Ms
      Wilkins of Counsel, not Ms Smith. Ms Wilkins relied upon  the  grounds
      appeal. Mr Tan sought to defend the judge's decision on the basis that
      the findings made by the judge were open to him on the evidence before
      him, having had proper regard to both the content of  the  appellant's
      witness statements and his oral evidence. He invited me to dismiss the
      appellant's appeal.

      Discussion

12    In relation to the Appellant's location, and the  direction  of  fire,
      the judge held as follows:

           "33. Further, the appellant, in his  first  statement  dated  22
           March 2018, sad  "As  were  [sic]  approaching  the  border  and
           approaching Iran, we started to hear shooting. My father told me
           that he thought the shots were coming from the  Iranians  border
           guards."  He went on to confirm, in his recent  statement  dated
           13th of September 2018,  they  were  shot  at  "approaching  the
           Iranian side." When pressed on this point in  cross-examination,
           he changed his account to the convoy being shot at  from  behind
           after they had crossed the Iranian border. The appellant  sought
           to explain this by suggesting the border does not  have  a  hard
           and fast demarcation and the fact they were being shot at  meant
           they must have crossed into Iran. Making due allowance  for  the
           appellant's age, I cannot accept this as an explanation. He  has
           reiterated the claimed fact of being shot at as approaching  the
           border twice; both occasions in statements he has made with  the
           assistance of his representative  so  it  cannot  reasonably  be
           suggested these were answers inadvertently given; they  are,  in
           fact, consistent  one  with  another.  Further,  the  statements
           indicate the shooting was  in  front  of  them  whereas  he  now
           maintains it came from their rear."

13    As the appellant argues that the judge failed to have adequate  regard
      to relevant evidence, it is appropriate to set out the  rest  of  that
      evidence (insofar as not already quoted within the judge's decision at
      [33]). In relation to the  appellant's  evidence  about  his  and  his
      father's location at the time that they were shot  at,  the  appellant
      relied upon paragraph 7 of his witness statement of 13 September 2018:



           "When we were shot at we were in the border  area.  All  of  the
           legal routes have checkpoints and gates so  that  legal  traders
           can enter legally. Illegal crossings are  not  defined  and  not
           marked, and the border area is several hundred metres  wide.  We
           would describe this area as 'no man's land'. When we  were  shot
           at we were in this area, approaching the Iranians side."

14    It is accepted by both parties  that  the  following,  taken  from  Ms
      Smith's note, is an accurate record of certain questions  and  answers
      within cross examination by Mr Townsend:

           "Q: WS1 [18] as we were approaching border to Iran we started to
           hear shooting, father said shots coming from  a  reading  border
           guards and shooting at us for what doing. You, your father,  and
           companions, actually in Iraq when shooting happened?

           A: As I have indicated in my statement we were  on  the  border,
           the border is wider, not a  specific  borderline  to  say  which
           country in, but I am sure we were going into Iran  because  shot
           at by Iranians border forces.

           Q: WS says approaching border and approaching Iran?


           A: Yes we were going, approaching the border,  we  were  on  the
           border, it is a vast area and no specific point that  tells  you
           that you are on this side or the other but because  shot  at  by
           Iranians border guards we were on the Iranian border."

15    The Appellant contends that  his  evidence  in  his  statement  of  13
      September 2018 was entirely consistent with  his  oral  evidence,  and
      that at no point in his oral evidence did he state that he had crossed
      the border; rather, as he had stated in his statement, had  said  that
      they were in the border area. The appellant argued that there  was  no
      inconsistency. Further, in relation to  the  direction  of  fire,  the
      appellant argues that the judge, in finding  that  the  appellant  had
      'indicated' in both of his witness statements that  the  shooting  had
      been in front of them, failed to have regard to the actual content  of
      his statements, neither of which gave any evidence as to the direction
      of fire. The first statement provided that he  and  his  father  heard
      shooting, which the father thought had come from  the  Iranian  border
      security guards [18], and in the second statement the appellant stated
      that they were shot at when in the border  area  [7].  In  stating  in
      cross-examination  that  the  shooting  had  been  from  behind,   the
      appellant had not given evidence which was inconsistent.

16    I find that the appellant's first ground is made out. In  relation  to
      the appellant's first witness statement, it is correct  to  note  that
      the appellant described starting to hear  shooting  when  'approaching
      the border and approaching Iran'. If the  border  were  treated  as  a
      clearly defined position or line, then the words used by the appellant
      in his first witness statement would tend to suggest that at the  time
      that they started to hear shooting, the appellant and his father  were
      still in Iraq.  Thus, although the appellant was silent in  his  first
      witness statement as to the actual direction of fire, it would  indeed
      be reasonable to infer, as the judge appears to have  done,  that  the
      firing came from in front of them, if it  came  from  Iranians  border
      guards.

17    However, the respondent having queried this sequence of events in  the
      refusal letter, the appellant gave further evidence about  the  border
      at paragraph 7 of his second witness  statement,  as  set  out  above.
      Although the judge notes at [33] the appellant's explanation that 'the
      border does not have a hard and fast demarcation' the judge's approach
      to the Appellant's evidence on this point still appears to  adopt  the
      model that the border is at a fixed point  or  line.  The  appellant's
      description of the border in his second statement, that  the  crossing
      is not defined, is not marked, is several hundred metres wide, and can
      be described as 'a no man's land', is clearly more  nuanced  than  his
      evidence at paragraph 7 of his first witness statement, but is clearly
      capable of having weight attached to it; the appellant  is  describing
      crossing a border area in a mountainous region, and not at  a  regular
      border control area.  The judge does not appear  to  consider  whether
      this more detailed description of the border area is capable of  being
      accurate or truthful.

18    The judge's suggestion at  [33],  line  11,  that  the  appellant  had
      stated in both of his witness statements that  he  was  shot  at  when
      approaching the border does  not,  I  find,   accurately  reflect  the
      content of his second witness statement, which provides "When we  were
      shot at we were in this area, approaching the Iranian side"  (emphasis
      added), and the appellant had described this  area  as  being  several
      hundred metres wide. Thus when the judge quotes at [33]  line  5  that
      the appellant had stated  they  had  been  shot  at  'approaching  the
      Iranian side', the judge has  omitted  to  refer  to  highly  relevant
      evidence immediately preceding those words.

19    Further, I find that at [33] line 14, when  the  judge  suggests  that
      both statements indicated that the shooting was in front of them, this
      does not accurately reflect the appellant's  evidence  in  his  second
      witness statement; he simply did not state that the shooting came from
      in front; rather, as above, he describes being shot at  whilst  within
      the border area, several hundred metres wide.

20    Further, there was simply nothing in the second witness  statement  or
      the appellant's evidence in cross examination that entitled the  judge
      to use the past perfect tense at [33] line 6: "He changed his  account
      to the convoy being shot at from behind after  they  had  crossed  the
      Iranian border"; the appellant's evidence was in the past progressive.

21    It  may  have  been  possible  for  the  judge  to  have  specifically
      considered the appellant's second and more detailed description of the
      border area, and to have rejected it, so long  as  reasons  that  were
      adequate in law were given for such a  finding.  However,  not  having
      rejected the appellant's more detailed description of the border area,
      I find that the judge has failed  to  take  into  proper  account  the
      appellant's explanation of the  setting  and  the  events.  There  is,
      practically speaking, no reason why Iranian  border  guards,  who  may
      also have been physically present within  this  border  area,  several
      hundred metres wide, could not have been positioned  100m  behind  the
      convoy, and to shoot at it from behind, as the convoy  was  travelling
      in the direction of Iran.

22    I thus find that one of the three core reasons given by the judge  for
      disbelieving the appellant's account is flawed. I cannot be  satisfied
      that the judge would have arrived at the same decision on the  overall
      credibility of the appellant's account, had he not made such an error.
      I therefore find that the judge's error was material to the outcome of
      the appeal.

23    It is not necessary for me to consider the appellant's second  ground,
      which argues that the  judge  failed  to  take  into  account  certain
      country and expert evidence regarding the risk to the appellant  as  a
      Kurdish failed asylum seeker. It is necessary for this  appeal  to  be
      heard afresh in the First-tier Tribunal. In doing so, the Tribunal can
      apply as it sees fit the further country  guidance,  post  dating  the
      judge's decision, now given in HB (Kurds) Iran (illegal  exit:  failed
      asylum seeker) CG [2018] UKUT 430 (IAC).
