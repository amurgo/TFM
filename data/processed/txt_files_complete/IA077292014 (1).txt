                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Hawden-Beal, promulgated on 26th June 2014, following  a  hearing
    at Birmingham Sheldon Court on 9th June 2014.   In  the  determination,
    the judge allowed the appeal  of  Sait  B  J  Ceesay.   The  Respondent
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Gambia, who was born on 12th June
    1971.  He is the spouse of Mrs Fatou Comma Danso,  a  German  national.
    The Appellant applied for a residence card as confirmation of his right
    to reside in the UK on the basis of being a family  member  of  an  EEA
    national exercising treaty rights in the UK.  The  Secretary  of  State
    rejected this application on the basis that the  Appellant's  wife  was
    not a qualified person, and that the Appellant was not a member  of  an
    EEA national exercising treaty rights, or that  they  were  related  as
    claimed,  and  it  was  not  accepted  that  they  were  in  a  durable
    relationship  with  each  other  either  (see  paragraph   3   of   the
    determination).

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge heard evidence that the Appellant  and  his  German  national
    wife had a relationship back home in Gambia from 1991 until 2001.  They
    were both unmarried at the time.  She, however, then married  a  German
    national and moved to Germany to be with him.  The  Appellant  and  Mrs
    Danso then had minimal  contact  because  her  husband  controlled  her
    communications.  They re-established contact in 2008.  This  was  after
    the Appellant came to the UK to study because it was  cheaper  to  call
    Germany from the UK than it was  from  Gambia.   They  rekindled  their
    relationship in April 2009.   They  maintained  contact  by  telephone.
    When Mrs Danso returned to Germany after her  first  visit,  it  caused
    problems within her marriage.  She separated from her  German  national
    husband.  It was not a formal separation  until  2010.   However,  they
    were divorced after July 2013 (see paragraph 14).

 4. The evidence before the judge was that Mrs Danso then moved in with the
    Appellant in his four bedroom rented flat which cost  ï¿½550  per  month.
    They  shared  interests  together.   They  married.    Their   marriage
    certificate,  dated  13th  September  2013,  shows  that  they  married
    according to the Muslim Marriage Law of 1941.  The Respondent does  not
    accept that this was a valid marriage registration because it  was  two
    weeks and three days outside of the one month time limit allowed by the
    law in Gambia (see paragraph 20).  The law is that if the  parties  are
    domiciled in Banjul  and  married  there,  their  marriage  has  to  be
    registered within a month of it taking place (see paragraph 21).

 5. The judge held that the parties, although married in  Banjul,  are  not
    domiciled there.  They do  not  have  the  benefit  of  being  able  to
    register their marriage when they get back to the Gambia or to  Banjul.
    The basis of the Respondent's objection to the marriage was that it was
    registered outside the time limits.  However, as  the  judge  observed,
    Section 16(A) of the 1941 Act, states that nothing in the Act "shall be
    construed to render invalid, merely by reason of its  not  having  been
    registered, a Muslim marriage  or  divorce  which  otherwise  would  be
    valid".  The judge held that in all other  respects  the  marriage  was
    valid.

 6. Accordingly, he would have to be satisfied "that Section 16 means  that
    the marriage is legally registered in Gambia even though  there  is  no
    evidence of payment of the late registration fee and thus it  is  valid
    in the UK for immigration purposes" (paragraph 22).

 7. The judge went on to say that the Appellant did  not  raise  his  human
    rights grounds but does say that the decision  is  discriminatory.   He
    observed that Article 8 rights were raised, but that no findings  would
    be made in relation to these rights (paragraph  24).   The  appeal  was
    allowed.

Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state that the decision is contrary  to  the
    case of Kareem [2014] UKUT 00024, which states that "the rights of free
    movement  and  residence  stem  directly   from   union   citizenship".
    Accordingly what was clear was that "the law that applies will  be  the
    law of the member state of nationality and not the  host  member  state
    ... ... this is because nationality remains within  the  competence  of
    the individual member states" (paragraph 16).  In this case, no  regard
    had been given to the position under German law, which was the EU state
    in question.  It mattered not whether the law of Gambia allowed  for  a
    discretion to be exercised in particular  circumstances.   It  mattered
    not whether  the  Appellant  could  fulfil  the  requirements  of  that
    discretion.  That was not the proper law.

 9. On 30th December 2014, permission to appeal was granted on this  basis.
    Reference was also made to TA (Ghana) [2014] UKUT 00316.

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 19th February 2015, Mr Mills, appearing  on
    behalf of the Respondent, submitted that the case of TA (Ghana)  [2014]
    UKUT 00316,  had  put  paid  to  any  argument  that  Kareem  was  only
    applicable in certain circumstances.  It applies in  every  case.   The
    recognition of the marriage has to be under the law of the EU  country.
    Second, the argument that the Appellant could succeed on the  basis  of
    having a "durable  relationship"  would  not  cure  the  error  of  law
    committed by the judge because the judge made no findings  in  relation
    to the durable relationship himself.  Regulation 8 requires the parties
    to demonstrate that they are in a genuine and  subsisting  relationship
    for there to be a durable relationship.  No findings were made in  this
    respect.  Third, Article 8 was not properly pleaded before  the  judge.
    The judge simply said (at paragraph 24) that he would make no  findings
    in relation to it.  Therefore, the error of law remained.  If the error
    of law remained, then the only proper course of  action  was  for  this
    Tribunal was to make a finding of an error of  law  and  to  remit  the
    matter back to the First-tier Tribunal for a proper finding to be  made
    in relation to the validity of the marriage as well as in  relation  to
    whether there was a durable relationship.

11. For her part, Ms Rutherford relied upon her skeleton argument.   Citing
    the head note  of  Kareem,  she  argued  that  what  the  determination
    suggests is that "a person must show that he is validly married in  the
    country where the marriage took place and that in  order  to  do  so  a
    marriage certificate from a competent  authority  should  be  produced"
    (see paragraph 5).  Here there was a marriage certificate issued  by  a
    competent authority.  Accordingly, the  judge  was  right  to  give  it
    credence.  Alternatively, the Appellant's removal would breach  Article
    8 ECHR because he has established a family life with Mrs Danso  in  the
    UK.  He has also in his six years in the UK studied and worked here and
    has established a private life.  Mrs Danso was exercising treaty rights
    in the UK.  To separate the couple now would be disproportionate.   She
    asked me to allow the appeal.

Error of Law

12. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  The determination  in
    Kareem [2014] UKUT 00024 was promulgated on  16th  January  2014.   The
    determination of the judge in this case was promulgated  on  26th  June
    2014, with the hearing being on 9th June 2014.  Kareem should have been
    applied and should have been brought to the  attention  of  the  judge.
    Any doubts about its application have been laid to the rest by the case
    of TA (Ghana) [2014] UKUT 00316.  The validity of the marriage in  this
    case has to be assessed not by reference to the law in the Gambia,  but
    the law in Germany.  Ms Rutherford helpfully submitted that she was  in
    no position to assist the court in relation to the law in Germany  even
    today.  The only outstanding issue is in relation to whether this is  a
    case involving a "durable relationship", but again,  evidence  on  this
    has  not  been  presented  before  this  Tribunal.   Accordingly,   the
    appropriate course of action is for this appeal to be remitted back  to
    a First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  other  than  Judge  Hawden-Beal,  to  be
    determined afresh.

Remaking the Decision

13. I have accordingly remade the decision on the basis of the findings  of
    the original judge, the evidence before him and the submissions that  I
    have heard today.  I am allowing the appeal of the Secretary  of  State
    to the extent that this appeal  is  remitted  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for proper findings to be made in relation to the  application
    of Kareem to the position under German law as far as this  marriage  is
    concerned, as well as in relation to  the  findings  regarding  whether
    this  is  a  "durable  relationship"  between  the  parties   in   this
    relationship.

Notice of Decision

14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    allowed to the extent that it is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to
    be determined by a judge other than Judge  Hawden-Beal  under  Practice
    Statement 7.2.

15. No anonymity order is made.
