Representation:
For the Secretary of State: Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For Mr Bhupinder Singh:  Mr Neil Garrod, Counsel instructed by N Sharma and
                       Co,


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State from the decision of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Callow sitting at Hatton  Cross  on  6th  September
    2016.  In that decision, which was promulgated on 10th October 2016, he
    allowed the appeal against refusal to grant Mr Singh's application  for
    an EEA residence card in recognition of his  right  to  reside  in  the
    United Kingdom as the spouse of Gabriella Maria  Vass.  Ms  Vass  is  a
    citizen of Hungary and Mr Singh is a citizen of India.

 2. The Secretary of State refused the application  because  she  concluded
    that the marriage was one of convenience and thus did not qualify to be
    recognised under the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006. This was the sole issue before the judge.

 3. The evidence upon which the Secretary of State relied was by way of the
    records  of  interviews  that  had  been  conducted  with  the  parties
    separately.  The  Secretary  of  State  concluded   that   there   were
    discrepancies in the replies that they had given to questions upon  the
    same topics.  Quoting from the reasons for refusal  letter,  the  judge
    set out those discrepancies as follows:

         "You stated that  your  wife  last  travelled  outside  the  United
         Kingdom on 20th July 2014 and returned  on  11th  August  yet  your
         spouse stated she last travelled outside the United Kingdom for two
         weeks at the end of September.  You stated you came to  the  UK  to
         study and confirmed you did not finish your college course (college
         was blacklisted).  You stated you had completed a university degree
         in physical education in India and your trade in  India  was  as  a
         welder on the railways.  You also stated that you have been  looked
         after "cousin's sister" (your cousin) Artiseda since coming to  the
         United Kingdom.  You  stated  your  wife  calls  your  cousin  Arti
         however your spouse stated she did not  know  anything  about  your
         studies and believed that you had  completed  your  studies.   Your
         spouse also stated that you may have been a PE sports instructor in
         India and had been supported by your niece  (with  help  from  your
         family) throughout your stay.   Your spouse stated that  she  could
         not pronounce your niece's name and called her "Povi".

          You stated you would like a job on the railways, welding again yet
         your  spouse  stated  that  you   would   like   to   work   in   a
         construction/building industry.

         You stated you put the engagement ring in your  wife's  bag  before
         she left for work and called her.  You state she  was  wearing  the
         ring when she came home and said yes.  Yet your spouse  states  she
         was not wearing the ring when she got home and asked  if  you  were
         serious and you stated you were.

         You stated you are not sure if your wife's mother got you a wedding
         gift or not, yet your wife stated her mother gave you between  �200
         and �300 as a  wedding  gift.   You  stated  that  your  wife  last
         travelled outside the United Kingdom on 20th July 2014 and returned
         on 11th August yet your spouse stated she  last  travelled  outside
         the United Kingdom for two weeks at  the  end  of  September.   You
         stated you came to the UK to study and confirmed you did not finish
         your college course (college was blacklisted).  You stated you  had
         completed a university degree in physical education  in  India  and
         your trade in India was as a welder  on  the  railways.   You  also
         stated that you have  been  looked  after  "cousins  sister"  (your
         cousin) Artiseda since coming to the United  Kingdom.   You  stated
         your wife calls your cousin Arti however your spouse stated she did
         not know anything about your studies  and  believed  that  you  had
         completed your studies.  Your spouse also stated that you may  have
         been a PE sports instructor in India and had been supported by your
         niece (with help from your  family)  throughout  your  stay.    You
         spouse stated that she could not pronounce your  niece's  name  and
         called her "Povi".   You  stated  you  would  like  a  job  on  the
         railways, welding again yet your spouse stated that you would  like
         to work in a construction/building industry.  You  stated  you  put
         the engagement ring in your wife's bag before she left for work and
         called her.  You state she was wearing the ring when she came  home
         and said yes.  Yet your spouse states she was not wearing the  ring
         when she got home and asked if you were serious and you stated  you
         were.  You stated you are not sure if your wife's mother got you  a
         wedding gift or not, yet your  wife  stated  her  mother  gave  you
         between �200 and �300 as a wedding gift."

 4. Mr Singh and Ms Vass each gave oral testimony at  the  hearing  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal and, as one might expect, were  cross  examined  by
    the Presenting Officer in order  to  afford  them  the  opportunity  to
    provide  an  explanation  for  the  above  discrepancies.   The   judge
    faithfully recorded the explanations given by Mr Singh at  paragraph  6
    of his decision:

         "In his evidence the Appellant accepted the discrepancy as  to  the
         dates when the Sponsor travelled to Hungary but explained the error
         on the basis that he mixed up the dates by a few weeks and that  he
         had never been good at recalling dates.  As to his  work  ambition,
         he was of the opinion that  the  difference  between  construction,
         railways and building was not material.  As to the engagement ring,
         he acknowledged that there was a  difference  between  whether  the
         Sponsor was wearing the ring when she returned home from work and a
         version  given  by  the  Sponsor.   However,  given   the   unusual
         circumstances of the proposal and secret placement of the  ring  in
         her handbag, the discrepancy relied upon was in  no  way  material.
         As to the wedding gift from the Appellant's mother-in-law,  he  was
         simply unaware of the fact in all, the interview lasted  for  about
         four hours wherein it was reasonable to expect that in  some  areas
         there would be differences in precise detail."

 5.  The  judge  thereafter  considered  the  definition  of  a  spouse  in
    Regulation 2, noting that it did not include a person who was party  to
    a marriage of convenience.  He also quoted from the judgement in one of
    the leading authorities on the  subject  of  marriages  of  convenience
    (Rosa [2016] EWCA  Civ  14)  before  setting  out  his  conclusions  at
    paragraph 14:

         "In this appeal, the uncontested fact of  a  marriage  having  been
         established, an onus rests with the Respondent to  prove  that  the
         marriage initially is one of convenience and that the burden is not
         discharged by showing a reasonable  suspicion.   The  discrepancies
         highlighted by the Respondent in the refusal and those advanced  by
         Mr  Bassi  in  his  closing  submissions  create  no  more  than  a
         reasonable suspicion.  In the event of being in error  in  reaching
         the  conclusion  wherein  the  evidential  burden  shifts  to   the
         Appellant I make the finding in the round and attaching  weight  to
         the parties' personal circumstances that the marriage is subsisting
         and genuine.  They cohabited in rented accommodation. Companionship
         and mutual support between the parties exists.  The failure to call
         the supporting witnesses does not  undermine  my  findings.   Their
         inability to attend the hearing unsupported  by  any  documentation
         has been adequately explained.  Accordingly the appeal is allowed."



    Ms Isherwood made a number of complaints about the above passage.

 6. Firstly, it fails to explain why the evidence relied upon by  the  Home
    Office amounted to nothing more than a reasonable  suspicion  that  the
    marriage was one of convenience as opposed to establishing  the  matter
    on a balance of probabilities.  Mr Garrod argued that the judge did not
    need to give reasons for so finding; all that was required of  him  was
    to recite the evidence,  identify  the  issues,  recite  the  law,  and
    conclude by saying that he did not find the respondent's  case  proved.
    I disagree.  It was incumbent upon the judge to examine and engage with
    the individual discrepancies relied upon by the Secretary of State,  to
    state (with reasons) whether he placed more or less weight  upon  them,
    to  consider  the  explanations  given  by  the  Appellant  for   those
    discrepancies, and  to  say  whether  he  accepted  or  rejected  those
    explanations.  Simply to state the Secretary of  State  had  failed  to
    discharge the burden of proof was an abnegation of  the  responsibility
    to make clear findings of fact.

 7. Secondly, the judge's reference to the evidential  burden  shifting  to
    the appellant seems to me to be based upon a misreading of paragraph 13
    of Papajorgji (EEA spouse - marriage of convenience) Greece [2012] UKUT
    38 (IAC). It is clear from that decision that the legal burden of proof
    remains upon the Secretary of State from first to  last.  It  does  not
    "shift". Moreover, whilst the evidential burden "may"  shift  from  one
    party to another during the course an investigation into the  issue  of
    whether a marriage is one of  convenience,  the  ultimate  question  of
    whether the Secretary of State has discharged the legal burden of proof
    will always be dependent upon a detailed consideration of the  evidence
    as a whole. References to shifting evidential burdens of proof are thus
    unlikely to assist in undertaking a rounded assessment of the evidence.

 8. Thirdly, in  finding  that  the  appellant  had  established  that  his
    marriage "is" genuine and subsisting,  the  judge  was  addressing  the
    wrong question. The relevant question was whether the marriage had been
    genuine at its inception.  This is an important distinction given  that
    it is perfectly possible for  parties  to  enter  into  a  marriage  of
    convenience but nevertheless subsequently develop genuine  feelings  of
    mutual love and affection over time.  I stress that I am not suggesting
    that this is what occurred in the instant appeal.  I  merely  highlight
    the possibility in order to illustrate the nature of the  flaw  in  the
    judge's reasoning

 9. I therefore hold that the judge made errors of law in the determination
    of this appeal such that it is appropriate to set it aside.

10. I canvassed with the representatives the question of whether the appeal
    should be re-made in the Upper Tribunal or remitted to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a complete rehearing. Ms Isherwood argued  that  I  should
    remit the case because I  had  in  effect  found  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had yet to make any findings of fact in this appeal. Mr Garrod
    refused to say which course I should adopt because, as he put  it,  "it
    is not as simple as that" given the issue that  I  have  identified  at
    paragraph  8  (above).  I  find  the  argument  of  Ms  Isherwood  more
    persuasive than the somewhat Delphic position that was  adopted  by  Mr
    Garrod. I therefore remit this appeal for complete rehearing at  Hatton
    Cross before any judge save Judge Callow.





Notice of Decision

11. The appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed  and  the  decision  of
    Judge Callow is set aside.

12. The case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for complete  rehearing
    at Hatton Cross before any judge save Judge Callow.

13. Any further directions concerning the conduct of this appeal are to  be
    made by the Acting Resident Judge at Hatton Cross.

No anonymity direction is made.
