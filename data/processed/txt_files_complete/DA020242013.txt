For the Claimant: No representation
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an  appeal  under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations"). The claimant is a citizen  of
    France and although born in the United Kingdom on 21 December 1993,  is
    not a British Citizen. Apart from a few visits to France and a visit of
    some eight to nine months' duration to the C�te d'Ivoire, he has  lived
    in the United Kingdom since birth.  His mother,  a  naturalised  French
    citizen, has also lived in the United Kingdom for in excess  of  twenty
    -two years, as have his siblings.

 2. The claimant has a poor history of offending, first receiving a caution
    on 12 April 2008.  Between 14 November 2008 and 22 February 2011 he was
    convicted on  seven  occasions  for  eleven  offences.   One  of  these
    convictions, for wounding with  intent  to  do  grievous  bodily  harm,
    resulted in a sentence of one year's imprisonment.

 3. On 15 May 2012 he was convicted at Blackfriars Crown Court of having an
    offensive weapon and affray to which he was sentenced to two years  and
    six months' imprisonment and given a three year  Anti-Social  Behaviour
    Order.

 4. On 13 August 2013, having obtained details from  the  claimant  of  his
    life in the United Kingdom, the respondent concluded that it was in the
    public interest to deport the claimant.  It was accepted that he  is  a
    French national and that, given the length of his  residence  here  and
    integration into the United Kingdom, she was required by  European  Law
    to establish that his deportation was warranted on  imperative  grounds
    of public security.

 5. The respondent considered that, given the claimant was subject  to  the
    highest level of Multi Agency  Public  Protection  Arrangements  (MAPPA
    level 3) and poses an immediate danger  to  the  public,  that  in  the
    absence of clear evidence that he had become  rehabilitated,  that  the
    "imperative reasons" test was met and that having  had  regard  to  the
    factors set out in Regulation 21(5) and (6), that his removal would  be
    proportionate.  She considered also it would not be a breach of Article
    8 to remove him from the United Kingdom.  The claimant appealed against
    that decision to the First-tier Tribunal

 6. In a determination promulgated on 14 February 2014 First-tier  Tribunal
    (a panel comprising First-tier Tribunal Judge Collier and Mrs R M Bray,
    GP) allowed the appeal. The Tribunal found that:-

     i) the claimant was  integrated  into  British  life  even  though  his
        lifestyle was antisocial [62];

    ii) apart from his nationality the claimant has no significant links  to
        France, the only reason for him having French nationality being  due
        to his mother who had been born in Ivory Coast  and  later  obtained
        French nationality [64] and that  she  had  settled  in  the  United
        Kingdom before he was born;

   iii) the claimant has never lived in France, has no relatives there, does
        not speak French and if deported, would not  have  anywhere  to  go,
        would be without a support network and would most likely  resort  to
        crime to survive [65, 66] and that  the  respondent  had  not  fully
        considered the claimed circumstances before taking the  decision  to
        remove him to France [69];

    iv) the claimant's criminal offending had  not  reached  the  levels  of
        seriousness implied by the crimes mentioned in Article  83(1)  TFEU,
        as referred to in PI v Oberb�rgermeisterin Remschied [2012] EUECJ C-
        349/09; and,

     v) the  respondent  had  not  fully  or  appropriately  considered  the
        claimant's personal circumstances or the impact of deportation being
        pursued and had therefore  not established the  decision  to  deport
        the claimant as proportionate;

    vi) having had regard to Article 8, the claimant's deportation would  be
        disproportionate when considering  all  the  matters  in  the  round
        finding [98] that as a result of  his  arrest,  sentencing  and  his
        imprisonment he is now aware of the consequences of crime, would  be
        aware of the prospect of deportation and could not  be  expected  to
        engage in further criminal activities and thus the ultimate  aim  of
        justification of interference had not been made  out  and  thus  was
        disproportionate [100];

 7. The respondent appealed out of time on the grounds that:

     i) the Tribunal had misdirected itself, failing to note that neither PI
        nor Article 83 set out an exhaustive list of crimes, had  failed  to
        engage with the evidence of the danger caused by the claimant who is
        a MAPPA 3 offender;

    ii) there is no evidential basis beyond the  claimant's  own  claims  to
        conclude he is aware of the  consequences  of  his  crime  and  thus
        insufficient evidence to conclude that he was not an  individual  at
        high risk and would amend his offending behaviour;

   iii) the Tribunal had materially misdirected themselves with  respect  to
        Article 8 reaching inadequate conclusions  in  failing  to  consider
        that the claimant's mother could accompany him to France  to  assist
        with reintegration, that the claimant had failed to  establish  that
        it was unreasonable to expect  him  to  live  independently  of  his
        family in France; that  the  conclusion  that  he  would  resort  to
        criminality  was  speculative  and  based  on  the  claimant's  oral
        evidence which is said to be self-serving and that the  evidence  of
        his family was also not objective.

    iv) the panel should also have  considered  that  as  the  claimant  has
        travelled  to  France  on  several  occasions  it  would  have  been
        reasonable to conclude that the claimant would have been capable  of
        communicating in France and secondly that he must have spoken French
        in Ivory Coast where he spent some six to nine months and that as he
        had grown up in a French family, it was not credible that he did not
        have a working knowledge of French.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Grant-
    Hutchison, accepting the respondent's  explanation  for  being  out  of
    time.

 9. It was on that basis that the appeal  came  before  Upper  Tribunal  (a
    panel comprising Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul and Deputy Upper Tribunal
    Judge Chana) on 29 May 2014. For the reasons set out in their  decision
    promulgated on 7 July 2014, they found that the  First-tier's  decision
    did involve the making of an error of law, and set it aside.  The Upper
    Tribunal held:

     7. It was incumbent  on  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  consider  first
        whether the respondent had demonstrated that the imperative needs of
        public security had been met; and, if so, whether, having had regard
        to the factors set out in regulations 21(5) and (6),  that  decision
        was proportionate.

     8. We consider that in approaching the first step, the Tribunal at [82]
        and [83] the panel misdirected themselves as to the  nature  of  the
        test, which is prospective, whereas they considered past  offending.
        Further, while "imperative  needs"  of  public  security  implies  a
        significant degree of  threat,  it  is  not  a  test  determined  by
        whether, as the Tribunal considered, the crime  committed  is  of  a
        specific level of criminality; still less can it be  said  that  the
        list of crimes alluded to in PI and Article 83(1)  TFEU  is  by  any
        means exhaustive.  The statement at paragraph 84 "we find that  this
        appellant's  criminal  offending  has  not  reached  the  level   of
        seriousness implied by the aforementioned crimes" is therefore not a
        relevant finding in assessing whether the imperative needs of public
        security is met.

     9. Further, it is not possible to discern  from  the  determination  or
        otherwise the process of reasoning by which  the  panel  moved  from
        assessing the type of crimes which may be covered by Article  83  to
        finding that the respondent had not made out a case.

    10. We consider further that in assessing the issue of the threat  posed
        by the claimant, the Tribunal erred in failing adequately to address
        the evidence that, as a MAPPA category 3 offender, the claimant  was
        seen as a serious risk. While this issue is  referred  to  [55]-[58]
        and [98], and while long extracts from  a  pre-sentence  report  are
        cited, there is no attempt to engage with the NOMS 1  report  of  22
        March 2013.  Still less is there any proper attempt to  engage  with
        the fact that the claimant has been  the  subject  of  adjudications
        within prison when concluding [58] that the  threat  of  deportation
        may have made him less likely to re-offend.

    11. In addition, the Tribunal erred when assessing proportionality under
        the EEA Regulations, a task not in fact  necessary  had  they  found
        that the imperative needs test had not been met.  The Tribunal held:



           "we find that the respondent  has  not  fully  or  appropriately
           considered the appellant's personal circumstances or  impact  of
           deportation being pursued.   We  find  the  respondent  has  not
           established  the   decision   to   deport   the   appellant   is
           proportionate in accordance with the  principles  of  Regulation
           21(5)".

    12. This is simply inadequate, and fails to explain  in  any  meaningful
        way the Tribunal's decision, and  while  the  panel  has  considered
        proportionality with respect  to  article  8,  [86]  -  [100],  that
        decision is infected by the errors identified above  in  respect  of
        finding  that  the  deportation  was  not  in  accordance  with  the
        regulations (a significant, if not  determinative  factor)  and  the
        conclusion that he was unlikely to reoffend.

    13. For these reasons, we  are  satisfied  that  the  determination  did
        involve the making of an error  of  law  capable  of  affecting  the
        outcome of the decision and in the circumstances, the decision  will
        have to be remade.

    14. With regard to the challenges to the  findings  of  fact  made  with
        respect to article 8 as set out in grounds d) we  consider  that  it
        was open to the Tribunal to conclude that the claimant  lacked  ties
        to France.  The grounds  fail  to  establish  that  the  conclusions
        impugned were perverse, and the matters raised at d (i) to (iii) are
        simply disagreements and attempts to reargue the case.

    15.  Nonetheless,  we  consider  that  the  finding  that  it  would  be
        disproportionate within article  8  terms  to  deport  the  claimant
        cannot stand given that that conclusion was infected by  the  errors
        identified above in respect of finding that the deportation was  not
        in  accordance  with  the  regulations  (a   significant,   if   not
        determinative factor) and the conclusion that  he  was  unlikely  to
        reoffend.

    16. Accordingly, for the reasons set out  above  we  consider  that  the
        determination of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the  making  of
        an error of law and we set it aside.

10. The Upper Tribunal then gave directions for the matter to be listed for
    the decision to  be  remade,  and  for  the  issue  of  the  claimant's
    nationality to be addressed as a preliminary issue.

Preliminary Issue - Claimant's Nationality

11. Section 1 (1) of the British Nationality  Act  1981  provides  that  an
    individual born in the  United  Kingdom  acquires  British  Citizenship
    automatically if, at the time of his birth, either parent was a British
    Citizen or was settled in the United Kingdom.

12. It is not disputed that the claimant was born in the United Kingdom  or
    that his mother is a French citizen and thus a citizen of the  European
    Economic Area.

13. Prior to 2000, it was  established  law  that  in  order  to  meet  the
    definition of "settled" within the  meaning  of  section  1(1)  of  the
    British Nationality Act 1981, an  EEA  national  need  only  have  been
    exercising Treaty rights  in  the  United  Kingdom.  This  position  is
    reflect in the  Nationality  Directorate  Instructions  at  chapter  3,
    section 3.5.1.4 which relates to the evidence needed to establish  that
    an individual had in fact acquired British Citizenship at birth:

        (if the child was born in the United Kingdom before 2 October  2000)
        evidence that one of the parents was an EEA  national  who,  at  the
        time of birth,  was  exercising  EC  treaty  rights  in  the  United
        Kingdom.

14. Thus, it would appear that in this case there is  no  requirement  here
    that  the  claimant's  mother  had  acquired  permanent  residence   or
    indefinite leave to remain at the time of his birth, only that she  had
    been exercising Treaty rights, in which case there would appear  to  be
    now power in law to deport the claimant

15. This matter was adjourned at the previous hearing to allow the claimant
    to obtain evidence to show that his mother had been  exercising  treaty
    rights at the time of his birth.

16. I heard evidence from Mrs Diabate  on  this  issue.   She  adopted  her
    witness statement of 30 July 2014 adding that although she had  started
    working shortly after her  arrival  in  the  United  Kingdom,  she  had
    stopped around the time she gave birth to her daughter  and  subsequent
    to that she had started to learn English and had gone to college.   She
    said that she had also  worked  part-time  on  a  temporary  basis  for
    various agencies although, as this was now over twenty  years  ago  she
    could not recall when or where that was.  She did confirm that she  had
    written to HM Revenue and Customs asking for details of the information
    they held regarding her national insurance contributions  and  payments
    of income tax.  The reply had not yet arrived although it appears  that
    the letter was to be sent to her employer's address.  I  adjourned  the
    hearing to allow her time to retrieve the letter from her place of work
    and then the hearing recommenced.

17. It is evident from the letter from HM  Revenue  and  Customs  that  Mrs
    Diabate did enter into the national insurance system before 1990.   She
    is recorded as having worked for two employers in the tax year 1990  to
    1991 but for the tax years from 1991 until 5 April  1995  there  is  no
    record of an employer or benefits received.

18. In the circumstances, where there is no evidence of National  Insurance
    being paid or benefits having been paid and whilst I do not  doubt  Mrs
    Diabate's credibility,  the  fact  remains  that  there  is  simply  no
    reliable evidence of her having exercised treaty rights around the time
    of the claimant's birth.  Accordingly, I am not satisfied that  it  has
    been shown on the balance of probabilities that he is a British citizen
    through virtue of his mother having exercised treaty  rights  from  the
    time of his birth.

Remaking the Decision

19. I heard evidence from the claimant.   He  said  that  he  is  currently
    detained under immigration powers.  He said he had  not  been  able  to
    complete any courses  designed  to  rehabilitate  him  as  without  the
    approval of his probation officer, this could not  be  done.   This  in
    turn required a sentencing plan which had not been put in place for him
    until February by which time it was too late for anything to be done as
    his sentence was to end in June.  It was not possible to  obtain  these
    programmes whilst in immigration detention.  He accepted  that  he  had
    received two adjudications in prison and that he had now  changed.   He
    said that he was older and at 21 he wanted to change.  He said that  on
    release he was supposed to have gone to a hostel but that was no longer
    available.  He said that there is still an ASBO in place preventing him
    to go to large areas of Camden but that did not cover  the  area  where
    his mother lived.

20. The claimant said that he had lived in the United Kingdom  all  of  his
    life, that all his family and friends are all here.   He  said  he  had
    only twice been to France, once to Disneyland and the  second  time  to
    obtain a visa to go to the Cote d'Ivoire but that he has no  family  in
    France.

21. In cross-examination the  claimant  said  that  the  statement  in  his
    witness statement that he had only been to Cote d'Ivoire for two months
    was wrong.  He confirmed that he had left home in 2008 although he  had
    not been forced to do  so;  this  was  mis-recorded  in  the  probation
    report.  He said that he had wanted to go out to live in a hostel as  a
    lot of the friends he had at the time had done so and that he  had  not
    wanted to remain at home with his mother and siblings.   He  said  that
    his mother had not been to see him when he had been in prison as it was
    a long distance from London as it was expensive and difficult  for  her
    to do so but he had kept in contact by telephone.

22. The claimant said that he had spent approximately six  months  in  Cote
    d'Ivoire although he had no family there, there  were  family  friends.
    He said that the language he had spoken there  is  Diolla  as  did  his
    friends.  He accepted that French had been spoken but not so widely  in
    the area where he was.  He said that where it has been written  in  the
    pre-sentencing report that he had gone there to  study  that  this  was
    incorrect and in any event it made no sense.  He added that he had also
    once been to Nigeria again to visit family friends.

23. The claimant said he had not finished the  school  here  but  had  done
    maths and English level 2  in  prison  as  well  as  level  1  business
    studies.

24. I then heard submissions.  Mr Whitwell relied  on  the  refusal  letter
    submitting that, even though it was  accepted  that  the  claimant  was
    integrated into the United Kingdom, had been born  here  and  that  the
    highest level of protection was  under  the  EEA  Regulations  engaged,
    still nonetheless this claimant did present a significant risk as shown
    by the NOMS Report.  It was to be noted that  he  was  in  the  highest
    category of risk with an 80% chance of reconviction and that he was  at
    MAPPA level 3.

25. Mr Whitwell asked me to note also the offences of  violence  which  had
    resulted in adjudications in prison and that there was no  evidence  of
    rehabilitation.  He submitted that in  these  circumstances  given  the
    substantial risk of further serious crimes  against  the  person  being
    committed the claimant's deportation was justified.  He submitted  that
    it was also proportionate given the claimant's conduct and lack of  any
    evidence of true integration into the United Kingdom,  the  absence  of
    any employment record or family life or connections other than with his
    mother and siblings.  He submitted that the  claimant's  dependency  on
    his mother was purely financial rather than emotional.

26. In reply Mr Diabate said that he had lived in the  United  Kingdom  all
    his life, that this country was all he knew  and  that  he  had  become
    integrated here.  He said his friends and family are all here and  that
    he had explained why he had not been  able  to  get  the  risk  of  his
    reoffending reassessed.

Discussion

27. As the appellant is an EEA  national,  it  is  for  the  respondent  to
    justify deporting the appellant. The relevant provisions are set out in
    the EEA Regulations which provide:

    21.  (1) In this regulation a "relevant decision" means an EEA decision
           taken on the grounds of public policy, public security or public
           health.

         (2) A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.

         (3) A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
           with a permanent right of residence under regulation  15  except
           on serious grounds of public policy or public security.

         (4) A relevant decision may not  be  taken  except  on  imperative
           grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

           (a)    has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period
              of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or...

         (5) Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public policy
           or public security it shall, in addition to complying  with  the
           preceding paragraphs of this regulation, be taken in  accordance
           with the following principles-

           (a)     the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
              proportionality;

           (b)    the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
              conduct of the person concerned;

           (c)     the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
              represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious  threat
              affecting one of the fundamental interests of society;

           (d)    matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
              which relate to considerations of general prevention  do  not
              justify the decision;

           (e)    a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
              themselves justify the decision.

         (6) Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
           policy or public  security  in  relation  to  a  person  who  is
           resident in the United Kingdom  the  decision  maker  must  take
           account of considerations such as  the  age,  state  of  health,
           family and economic situation of the person, the person's length
           of residence in the United  Kingdom,  the  person's  social  and
           cultural integration into the United Kingdom and the  extent  of
           the person's links with his country of origin.

28. The purpose of  these  regulations  is  to  give  effect  to  Directive
    2004/38/EC. It is not submitted that the provisions  of  the  Directive
    with respect to expulsion or deportation are not properly transposed by
    the EEA Regulations, but it is, in the context of this  case  important
    to note recital 245 which provides:-

        (24):  Accordingly, the greater the degree of integration  of  Union
        citizens and their family members in  the  host  Member  State,  the
        greater the degree of protection against expulsion should  be.  Only
        in exceptional circumstances, where there are imperative grounds  of
        public security, should an expulsion measure be taken against  Union
        citizens who have resided for many years in  the  territory  of  the
        host Member State, in  particular  when  they  were  born  and  have
        resided there throughout their life. In addition,  such  exceptional
        circumstances should  also  apply  to  an  expulsion  measure  taken
        against minors, in order to protect their links with  their  family,
        in accordance with the United Nations Convention on  the  Rights  of
        the Child, of 20 November 1989

29. It is accepted that by the Secretary of State that it  is  for  her  to
    show that there  are,  in  this  case,  imperative  grounds  of  public
    security justifying the claimant's deportation.  Having had  regard  to
    MG [2014] EUECJ C-400/12, in particular at [36]-[37] the  Secretary  of
    State's  concession  in  this  case  that  the  applicant   meets   the
    integration test, despite the fact that he is still in  detention,  was
    one open to her and cannot be put aside.  This is not a case  in  which
    the Secretary of State has conceded a matter of  law  rather  it  is  a
    concession of a matter of fact which is open to her.

30. It is notable that in this case, unlike the situation  where  the  five
    year threshold is met, it is only on grounds of  public  security  that
    apply,  not  grounds  of  public  policy.   The  CJEU  considered  both
    "imperative reasons" and "public security" in Tsakouridis [2010]  EUECJ
    C-145/09 noting[40] -  [41]
        40.   It follows from the  wording  and  scheme  of  Article  28  of
        Directive 2004/38, as explained in paragraphs 24 to 28  above,  that
        by subjecting all expulsion measures in the  cases  referred  to  in
        Article 28(3) of that directive  to  the  existence  of  'imperative
        grounds'  of  public  security,  a  concept  which  is  considerably
        stricter than that  of  'serious  grounds'  within  the  meaning  of
        Article 28(2), the European Union legislature  clearly  intended  to
        limit   measures   based   on   Article   28(3)   to    'exceptional
        circumstances', as set out in recital 24 in  the  preamble  to  that
        directive.
        41.    The  concept  of  'imperative  grounds  of  public  security'
        presupposes not only the existence of a threat to  public  security,
        but also that such a threat is of  a  particularly  high  degree  of
        seriousness, as is reflected by the use  of  the  words  'imperative
        reasons'.

31. The Court also noted [53]:

        53.    To  assess   whether   the   interference   contemplated   is
        proportionate to the  legitimate  aim  pursued,  in  this  case  the
        protection of public security, account must be taken  in  particular
        of the nature and seriousness of the offence committed, the duration
        of residence of the person concerned in the host Member  State,  the
        period which has passed since the  offence  was  committed  and  the
        conduct of the person concerned during that period, and the solidity
        of the social, cultural and family ties with the host Member  State.
        In the case of a Union citizen who has lawfully spent most  or  even
        all of his childhood and youth in the host Member State,  very  good
        reasons would have to  be  put  forward  to  justify  the  expulsion
        measure (see, to that effect, in particular, Maslov v.  Austria,  ��
        71 to 75).

32. It must also, in this context be noted that the  CJEU  held  in  PI  at
    [33];

        33.   In the light of the foregoing considerations,  the  answer  to
        the question referred is that Article 28(3)(a) of Directive  2004/38
        must be interpreted as meaning that it is open to the Member  States
        to regard criminal offences such as those referred to in the  second
        subparagraph of Article 83(1) TFEU as  constituting  a  particularly
        serious threat to one of the fundamental interests of society, which
        might pose a direct threat to the calm and physical security of  the
        population and thus be covered by the concept of 'imperative grounds
        of public security', capable  of  justifying  an  expulsion  measure
        under Article 28(3), as long as the manner in  which  such  offences
        were committed discloses particularly serious characteristics, which
        is a matter for the referring court to determine on the basis of  an
        individual examination of the specific case before it.

33. What is meant by "public security" is dealt with in detail in SSHD v FV
    (Italy) [2012] EWCA Civ 1199 at [87] to [94]  (per  Lord  Justice  Pill
    with whom Lord Justice Aikens and Lady Justice Rafferty agreed on  that
    point). I note that the court held [136]:

        136.  In my view, there is nothing in the statement of  Carnwath  LJ
        in LG (in the first Court of Appeal decision) that  is  inconsistent
        with what the CJEU has subsequently stated in Tsakouridis and PI on
        the scope of "imperative  grounds  of  public  security".  The  2008
        Tribunal was conscious of the fact that it was dealing with the  top
        "level" in the hierarchy. It considered the nature  of  the  offence
        committed by FV, which was a single incident of  homicide  committed
        against a flatmate in the context of their drunken relationship  and
        where the jury had  found  that  FV  had  been  provoked.  The  2008
        Tribunal considered in detail the OASys Reports and the question  of
        possible re-offending. Their interpretation of those  reports,  even
        if it could be criticised, cannot, in my view,  be  regarded  as  so
        unreasonable as to constitute a material  error  of  law.  The  2008
        Tribunal also drew a distinction, rightly on my  view  of  the  CJEU
        cases, between a person who is  so  homicidal  that  he  presents  a
        significant risk of killing members of the public at  random  and  a
        person who might be violent towards a specific person (in this  case
        FV's wife) which brought with it a danger of death to that  specific
        person. The 2008 Tribunal was correct to conclude that FV fell  only
        into the latter category. It also had in mind the  fact,  which  was
        common ground before them, that  FV  was  to  be  treated  as  being
        "integrated" in the UK, because he had obtained a  PRR  and  he  had
        been "resident" for 10 years immediately prior  to  the  deportation
        decision.

34. It follows that it is open to  the  United  Kingdom  to  conclude  that
    offences of violence, and in particular here, the continuing threat  of
    serious violence to a wide section of the  public,  is  one  which  can
    amount to imperative grounds of public security and  thus  what  is  in
    issue is the risk that the claimant currently presents.

35. Whilst I accept his evidence that he has not been able to  undergo  any
    relevant training courses owing to the late service of  the  sentencing
    plan only a matter of months before he was released, the  fact  remains
    that he has not undergone any  such  course.   I  thus  have  only  his
    evidence and that of his mother that he has changed.

The Assessment of Risk by the Probation Service

36. The starting point is the pre-sentencing report dated 13 November 2012.
     The offence analysis provides:-

        In summary on 21 March 2012 at Torriano Estate, NW5 Mr Diabate along
        with  his  co-defendant  as  part  of  a  larger  group   (numbering
        approximately eighteen people) chased a small group  of  young  men.
        Mr Diabate was seen by a member of the public to be in possession of
        a knife with a "seven to eight inch blade".   Police  officers  were
        called and Mr Diabate was found  to  be  hiding  under  bushes.   An
        independent witness approached the police  and  indicated  that  the
        person they had detained was the one carrying a knife.

        Case papers indicate that this offence was  committed  in  a  public
        place, during the day and was witnessed by several  members  of  the
        public.  I can only suggest that such  behaviour  will  have  caused
        fear, intimidation and anxiety in those who will have witnessed such
        actions.

        It would appear that a group of young men chased an  individual  who
        ran towards a larger group for  support.   This  larger  group  then
        chased  the  smaller  group.   It  is  difficult  to  establish  the
        underlying reasons as Mr Diabate claims to have been the  individual
        chased, however he is unable or unwilling to identify  his  chasers.
        His explanation would suggest that this was a  random  act  and  not
        based on a history.  I do not find this explanation to be  credible.



        As stated above, Mr Diabate could not or would not explain  who  was
        being chased and why.  When asked,  he  denied  being  part  of  any
        "gang" or being involved in the  serious  group  violence,  however,
        information obtained from the police and the Youth Offending Service
        would suggest that Mr Diabate leads a pro-criminal  and  anti-social
        lifestyle and is engaged in serious group violence, as a perpetrator
        and as a victim.

        In light of Mr Diabate's stance, it  is  difficult  to  explore  the
        underlying motivations, reasons and attitudes behind his  behaviour.
        It is my assessment that Mr Diabate's  associations,  lifestyle  and
        distorted thinking all contribute to the risk of harm  he  poses  to
        others.  Mr Diabate's suggests the matter is not serious or that the
        significances would not have been significant.

        Generally speaking offences of  this  nature  are  often  linked  to
        rivalries with other young people ... Although it  can  appear  that
        such offences occur suddenly, without  warning  and  are  over  very
        quickly, indicating no prior planning  or  pre-meditation,  I  would
        argue that group offending of this  nature  is  deliberate  and  the
        perpetrators are conscious of the reasoning  behind  their  actions.
        Such offending is reckless with no regard for  the  victim  and  the
        possibility of collateral damage to innocent members of  the  public
        is documented.

37. The report also details the claimant's previous offending as follows:-

        Mr Diabate is a young man of 18 who has appeared before the court on
        seven previous occasions since  2008  for  eleven  offences.   These
        consist of two offences of violence, three for theft, three burglary
        offences and three relating to police, court and prisons.

        The court will note that in May 2010 Mr Diabate  received  a  twelve
        month detention and training order for  a  conviction  for  grievous
        bodily  harm,  Section  18,  committed  on  25.2.2012.   Mr  Diabate
        acknowledged that he stabbed the victim.  In explanation Mr  Diabate
        informed me that the victim owed him  some  money  and  an  argument
        developed.  He tells me that he was aware of a knife which had  been
        "stashed" in the locality and as the victim was with his friends, he
        felt the need to  protect  himself.   Of  concern  is  Mr  Diabate's
        description of the offence as "just a stabbing" and when challenged,
        he stated that what he meant was that he stabbed him in the  stomach
        rather than injuring any vital organs.  This explanation is at  odds
        with the account that was relayed to  the  Youth  Offending  Service
        officer during the pre-sentence report interview.  On that occasion,
        he described that his friend came running towards him, being  chased
        and that he went to his friend's  aid.   The  court  will  note  the
        symmetry between this explanation and the current offence.  The case
        summary that I have received  from  the  police  regarding  the  GBH
        offence presents a different account of this matter, indicating that
        Mr Diabate robbed an individual and used the  knife  in  a  reckless
        matter to  frighten,  intimidate  and  secure  compliance  from  the
        victim.  Of note is that Mr Diabate was with another individual  and
        that they targeted three individuals and managed to direct them into
        an alleyway.  He is described as slashing  at  one,  poking  another
        with his knife before coming at the victim.  ...

        In addition to Mr Diabate's record of previous convictions,  I  have
        been provided with information from the police which  suggests  that
        he is capable of inflicting serious injury with no  regard  for  the
        victim and  he  is  known  to  carry  and  use  knives.   It  is  my
        understanding that the police were in the process of petitioning  or
        had petitioned the court  for  a  violent  offender  order  in  2011
        although I am not aware as to what the final outcome was.

38. The report also goes on to note that the appellant was asked  to  leave
    the family home at age 17 and that since leaving that house in May 2011
    he has been of no fixed abode that his mother did not want to allow him
    back in the family home nor did he wish to  return  there.  The  report
    goes on to say:

        Mr Diabate did categorically deny that he was part of a gang however
        the information available would contradict  this.   I  am  satisfied
        that Mr Diabate is capable  and  has  engaged  in  serious  violence
        without any hesitation on his part.  It is difficult to explore  his
        reasons for behaving in this way given his  refusal  to  acknowledge
        this reality.  It is also of note, the number of times that  he  has
        himself been the victim of serious violence.  Mr Diabate received  a
        bullet wound to his head in 2010.  Although it is not suggested that
        Mr Diabate was the intended target, his close  approximation  to  an
        incident involving a shooting causes concern.  I am also aware  that
        he received multiple stab wounds to his legs in November 2010 and he
        would not assist the police with enquiries.

39. The probation officer then goes on to assess Mr Diabate's risk of  harm
    to members of the public and known adults as very high.  That  is  that
    there is an imminent risk of serious harm to  others  that  event  more
    likely than not to happen imminently and to have a serious impact.   It
    is noted that he had previously been assessed at a very  high  risk  of
    harm by the Youth Offending Service, there is no reduction in  risk  or
    protected factors that would allow an assessment otherwise.  It  states
    also

        Statistical analysis of Mr Diabate's offending  record  indicates  a
        high (80%) risk of re-sanction within the  next  two  years.   These
        risks will continue to stay high as long as he  maintains  his  pro-
        criminal  attitude  and  lifestyle;  remain  associated   with   his
        offending peer group and does not make constructive use of his time.
         This will require a change in attitude and an acknowledgement  that
        his lifestyle is damaging to himself and others.

40. Turning next to the sentencing remarks I note that although Mr Recorder
    Katz was not satisfied that the incident for which  the  appellant  was
    most recently sentenced was gang related,  he  found  it  was  a  group
    activity which aggravated it and that the claimant was at the front  of
    the group, a further  aggravation.  Whilst  noting  that  there  was  a
    possibility of some form of rehabilitation and a  change  and  that  in
    mitigation his Counsel had said that he had  made  efforts  to  try  to
    start to change his life around his sentence was reduced  in  light  of
    the mitigation to 30 months from what otherwise would have been a three
    year sentence. The judge also imposed an ASBO.

41. The NOMS Report produced for the Home Office was produced by  the  same
    probation officer who produced the pre-sentencing report  and  contains
    much which is the same.  In addition it is noted at  page  6  that  the
    claimant and another young person had whilst in custody beaten somebody
    up who was a known gang member and that on 6 July 2012  he  attacked  a
    prisoner in class on behalf of another person  whilst  on  remand.   He
    comments:-

        The claimant is  able  to  engage  in  violence  without  reason  or
        warning.  His violence can be expressive and linked  to  revenge  or
        anger, however, I feel that it is  in  the  main  instrumental.   He
        behaves in this manner for personal gain, establishing  his  status,
        warning of rivals (revenge) on  a  location  gratuitous.   There  is
        further  evidence  of  difficulties  with  adult  relationships  and
        authority figures.  Prison report suggested although he  can  follow
        instructions, he can also choose to  ignore,  be  argumentative  and
        difficult.

    It is noted that he is at MAPPA category 3 and that his  licence  would
    have required him to live at an approved address, to be  subject  to  a
    curfew overnight and report to staff on a daily basis.  He  would  also
    have been required not to associate with the person with  whom  he  was
    convicted most recently, to contact directly or indirectly any  serving
    or remanded prisoner without permission.

42. It is noted also that  the  claimant  had  previously  breached  prison
    release licences on at least  one  occasion  by  committing  a  further
    offence in entering an area from which he had been excluded.

43. It follows from the jurisprudence that what is in issue in  considering
    whether the threshold is met is not the nature of the crimes  committed
    but the nature of the risk presented by the applicant in the future. In
    this case there is an imminent risk to members  of  the  public.   This
    goes considerably beyond the scenarios considered in FV and  the  other
    cases referred to above.  It is evident that this  risk  extends  to  a
    section of the public, not just specific individuals, and the fact that
    he  was  willing  to  attack  a  man  at  the  instigation  of  another
    illustrates just how dangerous he is, mirrored by his categorisation as
    a MAPPA level 3 offender.

44. There is no indication of any of the protective  factors  such  as  the
    stability of accommodation, family (in terms of a partner or children),
    employment  nor  any  realistic  prospect  of  this.  Whilst  there  is
    evidently some degree of control to  be  exercised  over  the  claimant
    through MAPPA mechanisms, that is essentially reactive.

45. Whilst I note that the First-tier Tribunal  indicated  that  there  was
    some degree of change on the part of the claimant, this does not equate
    to a finding that the risk he poses has diminished.  Further, there  is
    insufficient evidence that the imminent threat of removal if he were to
    commit another crime is, given his past behaviour, likely  to  diminish
    the risk.

46. I find that the claimant has not shown any real indication that he  has
    changed while in jail, nor that there is any good reason not to  accept
    the risk assessment produced in the NOMS report.  I find  further  that
    he has not shown any real insight into  his  offending  behaviour,  nor
    that  there  is  at  this  stage  any  real  prospect  of   him   being
    rehabilitated in the foreseeable future.  I am not persuaded that there
    is, on  the  facts  of  this  case,  any  material  difference  in  the
    claimant's chance of being rehabilitated in the UK or in France.  I  am
    not persuaded either that he  has  in  reality  addressed  any  of  the
    concerns raised by the probation officer as set out above.

47. Accordingly, I am satisfied that  given  the  very  high  risk  of  the
    claimant committing further  offences  as  shown  by  the  way  he  has
    conducted himself in the past, and that this is  likely  to  result  in
    serious harm to one  or  more  members  of  the  public,  that  on  the
    particular facts of this  case  the  imperative  needs  of  the  public
    security are met.

48. That, however, is not the end of the matter.  It is still necessary  to
    consider whether  given  his  level  of  integration,  his  removal  is
    proportionate.  I accept that, in  line  with  the  Directive  and  the
    decision in PI that there must be very strong reasons why an individual
    born and brought up in the United Kingdom should be deported.

49. I accept that the claimant has never lived in France,  and  his  little
    knowledge of French, but he has not shown that he has no  knowledge  of
    it, or that he cannot learn it within a  reasonable  period.  There  is
    insufficient evidence before me to show that he would be  destitute  if
    deported to France, or that he could not remain in contact with family.
     As noted above, he has little to show  for  his  years  spent  in  the
    United Kingdom, over and above his now limited ties with family and  an
    extensive criminal record. There is little or no evidence before me  of
    the content of his private life.

50. As against this, there is the fact that it has been established that he
    presents a significant threat to the community. For the  reasons  given
    above, I am satisfied that the imperative needs of public security  are
    met. That is a significant factor.

51. I assessing the issue of proportionality, I have  considered  also  the
    principles set out in Maslov, as well as the decision of the  Court  of
    Appeal in Akpinar v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 937. I note that the  claimant
    has lived here all his life, but his offences continued over  a  period
    and while he is an adult. He has no family here, and his  ties  to  the
    United  Kingdom  are  if  anything  by  default  rather  than  anything
    positive.  There is little or no evidence of substance to show that  he
    would face difficulties in integrating into France, the country of  his
    nationality, or that there are real and substantial differences in  the
    culture of what is, after all, another West European country.

52. Taking all of these factors into  account,  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    respondent has justified the decision to deport the claimant to France,
    and that accordingly, I dismiss the appeal under the EEA Regulations.

53. I now turn to a consideration of Article 8 of the Human Rights  Act.  I
    am satisfied that the claimant is a foreign criminal within the meaning
    of paragraph 117D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002
    and that thus, he is a person to  whom  section  117C  applies.   I  am
    satisfied also, for the reasons set out above, that he  does  not  fall
    within either of the exceptions set out in that section, and that  thus
    the public interest requires his deportation. Further, given  the  risk
    he poses to the public, the absence of any family life  here,  and  the
    limited extent of his private life and ties to the United Kingdom, that
    his deportation is a  proportionate  interference  with  his  right  to
    respect for his private and family life.  Accordingly,  I  dismiss  his
    appeal on Human Rights grounds also.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and it is set aside.

 2. I remake the decision by dismissing the appeal on all grounds.
