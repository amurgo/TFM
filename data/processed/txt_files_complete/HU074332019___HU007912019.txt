                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants appeal with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge James promulgated on 6 August 2019,  in  which  the
    First Appellant's appeal against  the  decision  to  refuse  his  human
    rights claim dated 10 April 2019 (following on from the refusal of  his
    application for indefinite leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  (General)
    migrant dated 26 February  2018)  and  the  Second  Appellant's  appeal
    against the decision to refuse her application on  human  rights  claim
    dated 19 December 2018; were dismissed.

 2. The Appellants are both nationals of India, who are husband  and  wife.
    The First Appellant entered the United Kingdom on 2 October 2007  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student with leave to remain as such until 31  January
    2010.  He was then granted leave to remain as  a  Tier  1  (Post  Study
    Worker) to 22 January 2012 and as a Tier 1 (General) migrant to 22 June
    2013 and then to 14 August 2017.  The First Appellant then applied  for
    indefinite leave to remain in the  same  category,  which  was  refused
    under paragraph 245CD of the Immigration  Rules  and  by  reference  to
    paragraphs 19(i) and (j) of Appendix A of the  Immigration  Rules.   In
    essence, the Respondent did not accept that the First Appellant's self-
    employed earnings were genuine.  The Respondent made a further decision
    refusing the First Appellant's human rights claims on 10 April 2019.

 3. The Second Appellant came to the United Kingdom on 26 March 2009  as  a
    dependent of the First Appellant and was granted  leave  to  remain  in
    line with him as a dependent up until 14 August 2017.  Her  application
    was initially refused in line with the First Appellant on  26  February
    2018, following which there was  further  consideration  of  her  human
    rights claim.   In  summary,  the  Respondent  found  that  the  Second
    Appellant would be returned, together  with  the  First  Appellant  and
    their child as a family unit and as such there would be  no  breach  of
    their right to respect for family life.  In terms of private life,  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules were not met.
     The Second Appellant had family in India, had spent  the  majority  of
    her life  there  and  would  face  no  very  significant  obstacles  to
    reintegration on return.  The child was not a qualifying child and  the
    best interests were considered to remain with  the  Appellants.   There
    were no exceptional circumstances  to  warrant  a  grant  of  leave  to
    remain.

 4. Judge James dismissed the appeals in a decision promulgated on 6 August
    2019 on all grounds.  I return below to the detail  of  that  decision,
    but in summary, the First-tier Tribunal did not accept that  the  First
    Appellant's were genuine and that he had deliberately sought to mislead
    the Respondent as to his income.  In  relation  to  human  rights,  the
    family would return together to India and  it  would  be  in  the  best
    interests of the child to remain with the  Appellants.   There  was  no
    disproportionate interference with the right  to  respect  for  private
    life and the Appellants could not satisfy the requirements for a  grant
    of leave to remain on the basis of  long  residence  given  that  there
    leave to remain had expired on 14 August 2017.

The appeal

 5. The Appellants appeal on  two  grounds.   First,  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal made 11 factual errors  in  the  decision  which  amounted  to
    errors of law as cumulatively these  errors  affected  the  credibility
    assessment.  The errors specified are as follows:

      i) In paragraph 19(a), the First-tier Tribunal  refers  to  the  First
         Appellant as a pharmacist with an assumed higher level of pay  than
         he actually earned as a pharmacy assistant earning �11 per hour;

     ii) In paragraph 19(b), the First-tier Tribunal  refers  to  the  First
         Appellant not realising the age of the child to whom he was  giving
         language tuition on an ongoing basis, whereas the First Appellant's
         claim was that he made a mistake about the child's age in interview
         only;

    iii) In paragraph 19(d), the First-tier Tribunal refers to a  difference
         in claimed earnings, which was explained by the  Appellant  as  the
         gross and net income figures, rather than a discrepancy;

     iv) In paragraph 19(h), the First-tier Tribunal relied upon  the  First
         Appellant's failure to  apply  for  administrative  review  of  the
         initial refusal of his application for  further  leave  to  remain,
         however the Appellant had accepted that there was no  case  working
         error given the mistake he made about the child's age in interview,
         such that there were no grounds to pursue an administrative review;

      v)  In  paragraph  19(p),  the   First-tier   Tribunal   relied   upon
         contradictory dates about the  commencement  of  language  tuition,
         however the First Appellant's evidence referred  to  his  financial
         accounting period separately to the  date  on  which  he  commenced
         tuition;

     vi)  In  paragraph  19(q),  the  First-tier  Tribunal   relied   on   a
         contradiction in  the  First  Appellant's  evidence,  referring  to
         earnings of �12,600 and also to �10,475, which as  above  were  the
         gross and net earnings and no contradiction in the amounts claimed.
          Further no reasons were given for this finding;

    vii) In paragraph 19(s), the First-tier Tribunal  irrationally  inferred
         from the letter from the First Appellant's  employment  that  there
         was no reason as to why the First Appellant left work early or  did
         not choose to work additional hours as a pharmacist;

   viii) In paragraph 19(t), the First-tier Tribunal  relies  on  the  First
         Appellant not claiming any income from self-employment in the  year
         2012/13, however his consistent  evidence  was  that  this  was  in
         2013/14;

     ix) In paragraph 19(u), the First-tier Tribunal failed to  have  regard
         to the bank statements available in the Appellants' bundle;

      x) In paragraph 19(w), the First-tier  Tribunal  had  failed  to  have
         regard to the reasons for the language tuition;

     xi) In  paragraphs  19(y)  and  (z),  the  First-tier  Tribunal  placed
         reliance on matters not put in issue by the Respondent, namely  the
         lack of evidence of financial transactions with the application for
         leave to remain in 2017 which had been accepted by  the  Respondent
         and to  the  contrary,  the  only  issue  was  whether  income  was
         genuinely from tuition.

 6. The second ground of appeal is that the First-tier Tribunal  reached  a
    perverse and/or irrational finding in paragraph 19(e) of the  decision,
    concluding  that  consistent  answers  given  to  identical   questions
    underlined credibility rather than supporting it.

 7. At the outset  of  the  oral  hearing,  Mr  Deller  on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent accepted that there were some factual errors in the decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal  but  indicated  that  the  real  issue  was
    whether any of these were  material  to  the  outcome  of  the  appeal.
    Overall, it was submitted that the errors do not undermine the  adverse
    credibility findings made against the First Appellant, either on  their
    own or cumulatively such that overall the conclusion reached  was  safe
    and open to the First-tier Tribunal on the evidence before it.

 8. On behalf of the Appellants, Mr Lam submitted that the  factual  errors
    were all relied upon in relation to credibility and  were  material  to
    the assessment of the Appellants' credibility.  The written grounds  of
    appeal were relied upon, with some additional detail and  reference  to
    the underlying documents before the First-tier Tribunal.

Findings and reasons

 1. I deal in turn below with each of the factual  errors  claimed  by  the
    Appellant before assessing their cumulative impact on  the  credibility
    findings made by the First-tier Tribunal.  At the outset it is  however
    necessary to  make  some  general  observations  about  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision.  First, the section headed findings of fact contains
    in paragraphs 10 to 18 details of the hearing  and  recitation  of  the
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal, with  findings  only  actually
    beginning at paragraph 19.  Paragraph 19 is itself divided in to 26 sub-
    paragraphs said to contain the Tribunal's  reasons  for  not  accepting
    that the First Appellant earned the money claimed for private  language
    tuition.  The style adopted in those paragraphs is less than helpful to
    any reader, with incredibly long sub-paragraphs as  well  as  sentences
    which at their longest extend to over a page and a half  of  text.   On
    any view, the approach adopted provides far less clarity in the reasons
    given than should have been the case, albeit the grounds of  appeal  do
    not go so far as  to  claim  that  the  decision  fails  to  allow  the
    Appellant to understand the reasons why his appeal was dismissed  as  a
    freestanding error of law.  Although it is arguable that this  decision
    falls short of the standards normally to be expected, it is not so  bad
    that the reasons can not be discerned  on  a  careful  reading  of  the
    decision as a whole.

 9. In paragraph 19(a) of the decision, there is a factual error as to  the
    First Appellant's primary occupation, being recorded  as  a  pharmacist
    rather than a senior pharmacy assistant.  His evidence was only ever on
    the basis of being a senior pharmacy assistant earning  around  �33,000
    for 45 to 47 hours work a week.  There was no direct  evidence  of  the
    First Appellant's hourly rate in his employment in this capacity and he
    claimed to earn  �30  an  hour  for  language  tuition.   However,  the
    inference  that  the  First  Appellant  could  earn  more  as  a  locum
    pharmacist and not work so far from home providing language tuition  is
    based on an error of fact and not sustainable on  the  evidence  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. In paragraph 19(b) of the decision, the First-tier  Tribunal  finds  it
    highly implausible that the First Appellant made a mistake in  the  age
    of the child he was providing language tuition for,  thinking  she  was
    five years old instead of seven.  It was found not to be a simple  one-
    off mistake but in the context of knowing the family for  a  number  of
    years and purchasing age appropriate learning materials for a five-year
    old, not realising for ten months that the child was  older.   However,
    the First Appellant has only accepted a mistake in stating the  age  of
    the child in his interview with  the  Respondent  and  not  an  ongoing
    mistake as to her age during the period of language tuition.   Further,
    it is clear from paragraph 19(x) of the  decision  that  there  was  no
    evidence before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  the  relevant  age  for
    materials used, only some pictures of books/materials  which  were  not
    labelled.  In these circumstances, it would appear that the  First-tier
    Tribunal misunderstood the  First  Appellant's  claim  and/or  did  not
    engage with the claim that this was a mistake in interview only  or  in
    the alternative provide reasons for rejecting this explanation.

 3. In relation to paragraph 19(d), it is necessary to set out the findings
    of the First-tier Tribunal in more detail,  although  given  this  sub-
    paragraph is almost two pages long I do not set it out  in  full.   The
    first sentence accounting for more than half of the sub-paragraph is  a
    verbose summary of the reasons for refusal  given  by  the  Respondent,
    which includes the Respondent's  identification  of  a  discrepancy  in
    earnings declared to the Respondent in his application of  �12,600  and
    that declared during his interview  of  �7000,  a  difference  of  some
    �5600; and discrepancies between the  First  Appellant's  accounts  and
    what he stated in  interview  as  to  business  expenses.   The  actual
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal start about two thirds of  the  way
    down on page 8 of the decision and are as follows:

         "... Having heard the oral evidence of both witnesses, and reviewed
         the Appellant's many documents submitted, and his explanations  for
         the concerns raised by the Respondent, I support the  concerns  and
         reasons for refusal raised by the Respondent  in  the  26  February
         2018 refusal decision due to the many discrepancies in the net  and
         gross figures claimed to be earned, as well as expenses which vary,
         the confusing and odd decision to issue invoices all with the  same
         number, and to issue them post-dated up to six months later, and to
         only have one child of seven years of age as a single client during
         this period,  and  that  the  parents  of  that  child  would  have
         unusually chosen not to speak to the  child  in  their  own  mother
         tongue to enable her to speak the parental language, or  that  such
         an aged child would require such intensive and time heavy tutorials
         on a daily basis over and above her daily mandatory schooling,  let
         alone that a child of such  tender  years  would  be  able  to  pay
         attention, sit still, or even have the cognitive skills to learn in
         such a high pressured environment and timetable;"

 4. The First-tier Tribunal does identify the  discrepancies  relied  upon,
    albeit by reference to the Respondent's reasons for refusal letter,  in
    both  claimed  earnings  and  claimed  business  expenses.   The  First
    Appellant claims that in  relation  to  earnings,  there  was  no  such
    discrepancy, only a difference between accounting periods as  explained
    in paragraph 17 of his witness statement, that the figure of �7000  was
    correct as to the amount earned until March 2017, the end  of  the  tax
    year, the figure of �12,600 being the  accounting  year  from  July  to
    July.  However, when one looks  at  the  interview  record,  the  First
    Appellant only stated that he earned  �7000,  including  in  answer  to
    question 11, "what was your total income from your S/E work during  you
    current T1 Gen app?  01 August 2016  to  31  July  2017?".   The  First
    Appellant's  explanation  is  also  not  supported  by  his  HMRC   tax
    calculation for the year ending 5  April  2017  in  which  �10,745  was
    declared as profit from self-employment,  which  he  confirmed  in  his
    written statement was correct.  For these reasons, it was open  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal to  find  that  there  was  a  discrepancy  in  the
    earnings figures claimed by the First Appellant between his application
    and interview and his explanation for this does not withstand  scrutiny
    on the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal.

 5. In paragraph 19(h) of the First-tier Tribunal's decision, it  is  noted
    that the First Appellant could have applied for  administrative  review
    of the refusal of his application in 2018  but  failed  to  do  so  and
    seeking to challenge it late in the course of this appeal was found  to
    be a concern.  The First-tier Tribunal in this part  of  the  reasoning
    has simply recorded the fact that the First Appellant did not  seek  to
    challenge the previous refusal on the grounds now raised.  That is  not
    disputed and at its highest, the First  Appellant's  written  statement
    simply accepts that there was a mistake in the age given  in  interview
    but does not expand further to explain that he therefore accepted  that
    there were no caseworking errors in the refusal in 2018  or  that  this
    was the reason why  he  did  not  seek  administrative  review  of  the
    refusal.  Paragraph 19(h) of the decision therefore contains  no  error
    of fact or error of law.

 6. In relation to paragraph 19(p) of the decision,  the  Appellants  claim
    that the First-tier Tribunal again relied on contradictory  dates  when
    in fact there  was  no  discrepancy,  simply  the  same  difference  as
    identified previously between the accounting year, tax year and  actual
    work dates.  The finding was that:

         "The dates claimed by the Appellant when  he  provided  tuition  to
         [the child] are contradictory in his interview, statement and  oral
         evidence, referring to August 2016 to July 2017, and also  that  he
         did not commence teaching her until 16 October 2016.  In turn  this
         contradicts the figures claimed to have been paid in the post-dated
         cheques;"

 7. In interview, having been referred to invoices dated 7  December  2016,
    23 December 2016 and 3 January 2017, the First Appellant stated that he
    started tuition at the end of September or first week  in  October  but
    had agreed that if there was a result from the tuition after the  first
    two months, he would be paid by back dated cheque.   There  is  nothing
    express in any of the written statements about the  dates  tuition  was
    provided.  In oral evidence, the First Appellant stated that he started
    tuition on 16 October 2016 which continued to July 2017.  At  the  oral
    hearing before me, the  only  submission  was,  as  per  other  claimed
    factual errors, that there was simply a difference  in  the  accounting
    year and tax year rather than any discrepancy.  Counsel did not however
    identify any express evidence on this point in the  written  statements
    nor consistency in the sources  of  evidence  identified  in  paragraph
    19(p) of the decision.  In these circumstances, I find that  there  was
    no error of fact by the First-tier Tribunal and to the contrary, it was
    open to it to find that there was an inconsistency in the  evidence  as
    to the start date of language tuition.

 8. In relation to paragraph 19(q) of the decision, the Appellants  made  a
    similar point as that in relation to  paragraphs  19(d)  and  (p)  that
    there was no discrepancy, only a difference in accounting periods.  The
    finding by the Tribunal was that:

         "The Appellant contradicts himself in his written and oral evidence
         of how much he was paid  by  [Mr  X]  for  tutoring  his  daughter,
         referring to  �12,600  and  also  �10,745.   Which  again  in  turn
         contradicts the figures in the post-dated cheques  referred  to  as
         issued by [Mr X];"

 9. Contrary to the grounds of  appeal  and  oral  submissions,  the  First
    Appellant had not expressly explained the difference between these  two
    figures.  Instead, in his written statement, in paragraph 7  he  stated
    that his declaration of self-employed earnings of �10,745  was  not  an
    error and later in paragraph 17, that total earnings for the accounting
    year were �12,600.  His written statement was  internally  inconsistent
    on this  without  express  reference  to  accounting  periods,  or  the
    alternative explanation that one is a net earnings  figure  and  one  a
    gross earnings figure.  In any event, there was a clear discrepancy  in
    the First Appellant's evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal  as  to
    what he was paid, for which there was  no  clear  explanation  and  the
    finding that there was a contradiction was clearly open to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal to make.  Further, the Appellants have not challenged the
    finding that there was a contradiction between earnings and  post-dated
    cheques.

10. In paragraph 19(s) of the decision, the First-tier Tribunal deals  with
    the evidence of someone that the First Appellant used to work with  who
    confirmed that he left  work  at  4pm  on  alternate  Thursdays  for  a
    personal matter.  It is taken as a point adverse to the First Appellant
    that the statement failed to address why the First Appellant chose  not
    to work additional hours or overtime as a pharmacist or why he chose to
    leave  work  early.   This  paragraph  repeats  the  factual  error  in
    paragraph 19(a)  as  to  the  First  Appellant's  employment  and  also
    includes an unfair adverse inference, as there is no reason as  to  why
    the letter confirming the First Appellant's hours of  employment  could
    or should have  contained  information  as  to  the  First  Appellant's
    motives for leaving early or not working overtime.  That  is  a  matter
    for the First Appellant to give evidence on  and  not  something  which
    required corroboration from his employer/a work colleague.  The adverse
    finding in paragraph 19(s) does therefore contain an error.

11. Paragraph 19(t)  of  the  decision  contains  a  clear  factual  error,
    referring to the Appellant claiming not to have earned any  income  for
    the tax year 2012/2013 whereas the only evidence before the  First-tier
    Tribunal was that he did not claim any income in the tax year  2013/14.
    However, the main findings in paragraph 19(t) which are adverse to  the
    First Appellant are in relation to the lack  of  witness  statement  or
    attendance at the hearing of a person  previously  engaging  the  First
    Appellant for language tuition for a younger  sibling  and  a  lack  of
    explanation as to why the  evidence  of  this  that  was  provided  was
    produced so late.

12. The Appellants state that in paragraph 19(u) of the decision, the First-
    tier Tribunal fails to have regard to the bank statements available and
    in circumstances where no issue has been  taken  previously  with  bank
    statements.  The findings in paragraph 19(u) of the decision  refer  to
    the lack of detailed  evidence  of  language  tuition  in  2012/13,  in
    particular the lack of information  on  invoices,  the  same  reference
    numbers used, the lack of any bank statements from the  client  showing
    payment or bank statements from the First Appellant showing receipt, no
    accounts for this period  and  no  details  in  relation  to  the  HMRC
    declarations.  The Appellants' bundle contained  three  invoices,  each
    for �1000, dated 1 December 2012, 15 January 2013 and 20 February 2013;
    and copies of the First Appellant's bank  statements  from  3  December
    2012 to 18 February 2012.  These bank statements contain four  deposits
    of �1000 on 5 December 2012, 13 December 2012, 7 January  2013  and  16
    January 2013.  The deposits do not clearly or  expressly  correlate  to
    the invoices and there was no explanation from  the  Appellants  as  to
    these documents beyond  the  statements  being  described  as  'showing
    payments received' from the client in the index to the bundle.  On this
    evidence, the First-tier Tribunal was entitled to find that there  were
    no bank statements for the First Appellant showing receipt of the  sums
    in the invoices and there is no challenge  to  the  remaining  findings
    about lack of other documents and detail.  There is therefore no  error
    of fact or law in paragraph 19(u) of the decision.

13. In relation to paragraph 19(w), the Appellants do not claim  any  error
    of fact, but that the First-tier Tribunal simply failed to have  regard
    to the evidence as to why  tuition  was  needed  for  the  child.   The
    evidence  is  however  recorded  in  the  decision,  in  particular  in
    paragraph 18, that the parents were worried about the  child's  ability
    to cope in school in India as she could not  read  or  write  Hindi  or
    Gujarati and there was nothing to suggest that this was not taken  into
    account by the First-tier Tribunal.  It is also not  inconsistent  with
    the finding in paragraph 19(w) questioning the need for high  intensity
    tuition (against the background of other findings) given that the child
    was also being taught in English in India.  Paragraph  19(w)  discloses
    no error of fact or law.

14. Finally, the Appellants challenge the findings in paragraphs 19(y)  and
    (z) of the First-tier Tribunal's decision for relying  on  matters  not
    challenged by the Respondent.  Again, this is not a  claimed  error  of
    fact but more of a procedural concern that  matters  have  been  relied
    upon in circumstances where they were not previously in issue, however,
    contrary to submissions on behalf of the Appellants, there  is  nothing
    to suggest the Respondent had accepted any of  these  points  or  other
    documents not before the First-tier Tribunal.  Paragraph 19(y)  of  the
    decision deals  with  the  lack  of  bank  statements  from  the  First
    Appellant for the relevant dates between 1  August  2016  and  31  July
    2017, which would have been available to him to  produce  to  show  his
    claimed earnings from self-employment.  Paragraph 19(z) deals with  the
    very  limited  evidence  as   to   the   HMRC   tax   calculation   and
    inconsistencies between that and the First  Appellant's  evidence.   In
    neither paragraph is there any reliance on matters previously  accepted
    or even undisputed by  the  Respondent  and  both  simply  reflect  the
    Appellants'  failure  to  submit  evidence   supporting   the   claimed
    genuineness of earnings from self-employment.  The  findings  in  these
    two paragraphs contain no error of fact, no procedural irregularity and
    no error of law.  Instead, they contain findings that were open to  the
    First-tier Tribunal on the very limited evidence before it  as  to  the
    First Appellant's earnings and the genuineness of the same.

15. Overall, in relation to the eleven matters raised in the  first  ground
    of appeal, although there are some factual errors  and  unfair  adverse
    inferences drawn, there remains a wide range of reasons as  to  why  an
    adverse credibility finding is made and  why  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    finds  that  the  earnings  are  not  genuine  or  from  genuine  self-
    employment.  There are a significant number of findings in paragraph 19
    which have not been challenged at all by the Appellants and significant
    and weighty findings as to discrepancies in the evidence  and  lack  of
    supporting evidence on  key  issues  such  as  earnings,  expenses  and
    payments as well as the practicalities  and  need  for  the  extent  of
    claimed language tuition, that the overall conclusions reached  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal would inevitably have been the  same  even  without
    the errors identified.

16. As to the second ground of appeal, the findings in paragraph 19(e) were
    as follows:

         "... I also do not  accept  that  the  child  was  given  differing
         methological didactic approaches as claimed by the witnesses,  e.g.
         use of an ipad or outdoor trips, as these  were  generic  identical
         claims in their statements and oral  evidence  without  any  detail
         provided.  The oral evidence given was repeated as if by  rote  and
         appeared to be 'learned' rather than spontaneously referred  to  in
         the personal words of the  individual  witnesses,  such  that  this
         rather  rigid  repetitive  approach   tended   to   undermine   the
         credibility of their claims;"

17. Whilst it may be the case that witnesses who given  consistent  answers
    to identical questions in  evidence  could  be  found  to  support  the
    credibility of a claim; that is not necessarily the  case  and  answers
    which are identical using the same phrase for example, can lawfully  be
    found to undermine credibility if  it  displays  co-ordinated  or  pre-
    planned evidence.  In the present appeal, the First-tier  Tribunal  has
    given reasons for such a latter finding which discloses no error of law
    in approach.   The  written  statements  of  the  First  Appellant  and
    parent/client are very similar and  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  the
    benefit of oral evidence from both  to  compare  and  form  an  overall
    impression of the quality of the evidence.  It is a matter of  judgment
    for the First-tier Tribunal to  assess  the  evidence,  including  oral
    evidence before it.  In any event, for the same reasons as given above,
    there is a plethora of reasons for  the  adverse  credibility  findings
    made and overall conclusions which would be unaffected  even  if  there
    was any error disclosed in paragraph 19(e) of the decision.

18. Overall, for the reasons set out above, I  do  not  find  any  material
    error of law, individually or cumulatively, that  could  have  affected
    the outcome of this appeal.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such  it  is  not  necessary  to  set
aside the decision.

The decision to dismiss the appeals is therefore confirmed.

No anonymity direction is made.
