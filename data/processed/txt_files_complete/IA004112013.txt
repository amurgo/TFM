                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant was born on 16 March 1982 and is a citizen   of  Nigeria.
    He applied on 9 October 2012 for a residence card as a confirmation  of
    a right of residence  in  the  United  Kingdom  under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

2.   He contends that he entered into  a  customary  marriage  with  a  Miss
    Barbora Gabcova.  He produced certain  documents  in  support  of  that
    position.

3.   It was his decision that his appeal should be dealt with on the  papers
    and accordingly his appeal was considered by First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Harris on the papers on 28 February 2013.

4.   The judge noted that the appellant had not addressed the issue  whether
    his marriage was by proxy or by other means or whether  he  indeed  had
    been present with his wife at the ceremony.  It was  noted  that  there
    was no statement from the appellant or sponsor in support of the appeal
    to  explain  the  documents  or  provided  evidence  of  a  durable  or
    subsisting relationship.

5.   Complaint is made in the grounds of appeal that indeed a  statement  of
    the appellant had been submitted. It is dated 1 March 2013 and sent  to
    the Tribunal under cover of a letter of  5  February  2013  being  date
    stamped received at Newport on 4 March 2013.  It had not made this  way
    to the judge. That fact is not surprising given that the  decision  was
    written before the receipt of the statement by the Tribunal.

6.   I note from the file that on 5 February 2013 directions  were  sent  to
    the parties indicating that the matter was to be decided on the  papers
    without a hearing and making a request that any  written  evidence  and
    submissions must be received "in this office by 05/03/2013".   Thus  it
    would seem that the statement was received  by the office in accordance
    with that direction.  However for  some  reason  the  appeal  had  been
    listed for determination on the papers  on  28  February  2013.   There
    would seem to be little point in giving a time  frame  for  receipt  of
    evidence that is ignored in the listing process.

7.   The matter came before me for hearing on 3 May 2013.  Mr  Saunders  who
    represents the respondent submitted that even if the statement had been
    received it added little to the materiality of the evidence  and  would
    have made little difference therefore to the outcome.

8.   Although I have some sympathy with that submission, justice  is  to  be
    done and seen to be done.  In those circumstances I  found  that  there
    was procedural irregularity such as to call into question the  fairness
    of the proceedings. Accordingly I set aside the decision to be remade.

9.   I asked Mr Wainwright who represented the appellant  on  that  occasion
    whether the appellant wished to have an  oral  hearing  or  whether  it
    should be dealt with on the papers.  Somewhat surprisingly he indicated
    that the appellant wanted the matter dealt with on the papers.

10.  I indicated that there was little  detail  from  the  appellant  as  to
    precisely the procedures  which  were  followed  leading  to  marriage.
    There were no details as to  which  relatives  were  present  and  why.
    Little detail is provided as to the amount of any dowry and if  so,  to
    whom it was paid and why.  It was noted that on  a  previous  occasions
    the appellant had sought to apply for  a  certificate  of  approval  to
    marry but this was not done in this case.  The reason for that  may  or
    may not be significant.

11.  I indicated also that there was no evidence from the  appellant's  wife
    as to the circumstances of her relationship with the appellant or as to
    its detail of continuing nature.  I note the comments made by the judge
    that there was a paucity of information that the  marriage  was  either
    genuine or subsisting.

12.  I stressed to Mr Wainwright that it was of  course  a  matter  for  the
    appellant whether  or  not  he  chooses  to  submit  further  evidence.
    Fairness  demands  that  he  and  his  representatives  be  given  that
    opportunity.

13.  Accordingly therefore I indicated that I would  indeed  deal  with  the
    matter upon the  papers  as  requested  but  after  28  days  from  the
    promulgation of the decision.  I indicated that  any  further  evidence
    should be in proper form and submitted for my attention no later than 7
    days prior to the expiry of the 28 day period so as to enable papers to
    be properly processed and placed before me.

14.  These directions were promulgated  on  23  May  2013  and  thus  as  at
    today's date three months have expired.

15.  It is significant that no further documentation has been received  from
    the appellant.  The directions were sent to the appellant at his stated
    address and or his solicitors. In any  event  Mr  Wainwright  was  well
    aware of the issues as at 3 May since he was present when  I  indicated
    the general nature of the directions which I proposed to give.

16.  There would seem to be three issues that fall  for  consideration.  The
    first is whether or not there has been a lawful marriage as between the
    appellant and Miss Gabcova who is a Czech national.   If  indeed  there
    has been a valid marriage, whether that  marriage  is  subsisting.   If
    subsisting, whether or not the spouse of the  appellant  is  exercising
    treaty rights.

17.  The requirement is upon the  appellant  to  shown  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities that he is the family member of an EEA national, sponsor,
    exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom as a qualified person as
    defined in Regulation 6 of the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006.

18.  The statement of the appellant is to the effect that  he  has  been  in
    the United Kingdom since 2009.  He met his wife in September  2011  and
    got married on 19 January 2012.  He asserts that his wife lives in  the
    United Kingdom exercising treaty rights working as a cleaner.

19.  He said that he got married by way of traditional marriage  in  Nigeria
    and later registered the marriage at the registry  office  in  Nigeria.
    There were no requirements for the parties to the  marriage  to  attend
    the ceremony since both relatives were present.  I  expressed  surprise
    that the Secretary of State questioned the marriage certificate despite
    the fact that it was obtained from the right source.  He encloses  with
    his appeal the Nigerian Marriage Act and Sections 34 and 325 of the Act
    supporting the contention that the marriage certificate should  not  be
    questioned.  He says that he has gone thorough the proper procedures in
    Nigeria for customary marriages and therefore the  marriage  should  be
    accepted.

20.  Two documents are relied upon, the first being  that  of  an  affidavit
    from James Oghara dated 26 March 2012. He purports to be the brother of
    the appellant and declares that the appellant got  married  to  Barbora
    Gabcova on 19 January 2012 with the consent of Mr Roman Gabcova.  There
    is an affidavit purportedly sworn at the Ehor Customary Court Registry.
     It is not entirely clear what part James Oghara had  to  play  in  the
    procedure and on what basis he has knowledge of the facts which he  now
    claims.

21.  There is a Testimony of the Native  Law  and  Customary  Marriage  also
    dated 26 March 2012 issued out of the Registry of  Marriages  in  Benin
    City.   It purports to be a certificate by Mr and Mrs Roman Gabcove who
    are parents of the sponsor indicating that they have given  consent  to
    the marriage and that a dowry has been  paid.

 22. A curious feature of that particular  document  is  that  it  says  "In
    testimony of my declaration of consent to this marriage I  (we)  herein
    under affix my (our) signatures or marks." There is no signature on the
    document other than a signature from a witness.  Without any  name  for
    the witness it is difficult to understand who that witness is.

23.  The respondent invites me  to  consider  the  context  in  which  those
    documents were presented.   The  background  information  from  a  COIS
    Report on Nigeria is relied upon by the respondent  to  show  that  the
    marriage is not a valid one in Nigeria.   It  is  said  that  paragraph
    24.23 of the COIS Report records that both  parties  to  the  marriages
    technically must be  physically  present  at  the  same  location  with
    witness to sign certain marriages documents  and  that  proxy  marriage
    have ceased to be valid but still occur.  Set beside that is indeed the
    Nigeria Marriage Act which seems  to  suggest  that  certain  customary
    marriages are still recognised as being valid.

24.  That  having  been  said,  it  may  reasonably  be  considered  that  a
    customary marriage  is  still  expected  to  conform  with  the  proper
    procedure laid down for that type of marriage. There is and  remains  a
    paucity of information from the appellant  to  indicate  where  it  was
    conducted and how it was conducted.   The  statement  prepared  by  the
    appellant would seem to recognise that a form of ceremony is  required.
    He claims that such was satisfied since both  relatives  were  present.
    It is not entirely clear where therefore this  ceremony  was  conducted
    and what form it should have  taken.   It  is  not  apparent  from  the
    Testimony of Native Law and Customs that Mr and Mrs Roman Gabcova  were
    actually physically present, the affidavit  merely  says  that  it  was
    conducted with the consent of Mr Roma Gabcova.

25.  The respondent noted that the appellant had  previously  applied  on  7
    August 2010 for a certificate of approval to  marry  his  then  British
    fianc�e Miss Lewison Love Ose.  Another application  was  made  by  the
    appellant and refused on 19 October 2011 on the basis  of  his  claimed
    status as the unmarried  partner  of  a  Polish  national  Miss  Danute
    Radtke.  The respondent concluded  that  the  appellant's  relationship
    with Miss Gabcova was of  relatively  short  duration.   She  found  no
    evidence to show  the  relationship  between  the  appellant  and  Miss
    Gabcova to be durable and subsisting.

26.  Apart from the marriage certificate the other  documents  submitted  by
    the appellant are an expired tenancy agreement for six months  from  27
    February 2012 showing the names of the appellant and the sponsor, a  TV
    licensing letter dated 20 March 2012 addressed to the appellant at  the
    tenancy address and an electricity  bill  dated  14  May  2012  in  the
    appellant's sponsor's name at the tenancy address.  There is a  further
    letter confirming her employment dated 4 October 2012 and  payslips  in
    her name.

27.  It is significant, as I so find, that  in  the  witness  statement  the
    appellant claims that he met his wife in September 2011 and  married  a
    few months later.  This is notwithstanding the fact that on 19  October
    2011 he was seeking to be married to a Polish national.   I  find  that
    factor to be indicative that there was in fact  no  relationship  of  a
    romantic or emotional nature with Miss Gabcova.  I  find  further  that
    the pattern of his applications to marry are  indicative  of  the  real
    intention of the appellant to secure residence.

28.  I find it significant that although the appellant has been  advised  of
    the desirability of providing further evidence as to his  marriage  and
    his relationship with the sponsor, he has not done so.

29.  Looking at the matter overall and  applying  the  appropriate  standard
    and burden of proof, I do not find that the  appellant  as  established
    that his claimed marriage to Miss Gabcova was in  accordance  with  any
    recognised form of customary marriage.  The appellant has not given any
    indication as to why he has chosen  a  proxy  marriage  in  Nigeria  in
    respect of someone who has no connection with Nigeria.  There has  been
    no application  to  marry  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  there  is  no
    indication as to what connection, if  at  all,  there  is  between  the
    sponsor,  her  parents  and  Nigeria.   It  is  also  significant   and
    undermining of the claimed relationship that she has made no  statement
    concerning that matter herself.

30.  In any event, I do not find that there is  any  subsisting  or  durable
    relationship as between the appellant and Miss Gabcova.

31.  I note that the tenancy agreement was signed on 27  February  2012  and
    any document linking the appellant with that  address  therefore  would
    seem to be a TV licence payment card for 30 March 2012.  An electricity
    bill dated 28 May 2012 and the various payslips link the  sponsor  with
    that address in April to August and September 2012.  Such does not show
    without more cohabitation.

32.  The letter from Oscar Cleaning Services dated 4 October  2012  purports
    to indicate that Miss Gabcova started employment as at 19  March  2012.
    There is no indication as to the nature of that employment  so  far  as
    hours are concerned.   It is not  entirely  clear  how  much  work  was
    expected of her.  According to the wage  slips  of  30  September  2012
    there is total pay of �1,355 with no income tax paid. The net  pay  for
    that month is said to be �681.52 and the net pay for the previous month
    �663.04.

33.  If that be correct it begs the question as  to  what  she  was  earning
    five months previous to those wage slips.

34.  I do  not find that those wage slips tell an  accurate  picture  as  to
    her earnings.

35.  My concerns are also highlighted by the wage slip for April 2012  which
    again reflects a net pay of �636.62, speaking on  that  account  as  to
    total gross pay of �2,002 what she had  only  stated  in  the  previous
    month.

36.  I find it difficult to reconcile the figures as set out and  for  those
    reasons I find the documentation submitted is unreliable.   I  bear  in
    mind the principles to be followed under Tanveer Ahmed.  Once again  it
    of course would be entirely open  to  the  sponsor  to  have  submitted
    further documentation in support of her working as was  highlighted  in
    the directions which I set.

37.  Overall I do not find therefore that the appellant or the  sponsor  are
    credible as to the facts which they seek to present to the Tribunal.  I
    do not find that they are lawfully married according to the customs  of
    their country.  I do not find that they are in a durable or  subsisting
    relationship.  I do not find that  the  sponsor  is  exercising  treaty
    rights.  Looking at the overall context I  have  little  hesitation  in
    concluding that the appellant is seeking to deceive the authorities  as
    to his status and situation in the United Kingdom.

38.  The appeal is dismissed.
