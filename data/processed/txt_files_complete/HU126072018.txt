Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Z Malik, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    a First-tier Tribunal Judge (Judge Wright)  allowing  Ms  [U]'s  appeal
    against the Secretary of State's refusal to grant her leave  to  remain
    in the UK.  The date of the Secretary of State's decision is  25th  May
    2018.

 2. For the sake of clarity throughout this decision I shall refer  to  the
    Secretary of  State  as  "the  Respondent"  and  to  Ms  [U],  as  "the
    Appellant" thus reflecting their respective positions before the First-
    tier Tribunal.

 3. The Appellant is a national of  Nigeria  born  21st  April  1983.   She
    appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against the  Respondent's  decision
    refusing her application for leave to remain in  the  UK,  pursuant  to
    Article 8 ECHR (family/private life). The Respondent  had  refused  the
    application with reference  to  paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 4. In summary, the basis for the Respondent's refusal is as follows.   The
    Appellant entered the UK originally in October 2006 in possession of  a
    valid student visa. Thereafter she made various applications for  leave
    to remain, all of which were granted.  On 4th April 2013 the  Appellant
    applied for further leave to remain as a Tier 1  general  migrant.   In
    order to meet necessary requirement of the relevant financial rule, she
    claimed a total  income  of  �36,629.   Further  leave  to  remain  was
    granted.

 5. On 15th December 2016 the Appellant made an application for  indefinite
    leave to remain on the  basis  of  ten  years'  long  residence.   This
    application prompted an enquiry by  the  Respondent  with  HMRC.   That
    enquiry disclosed that in tax year  2012/2013  the  Appellant  declared
    income to HMRC amounting only to a total of  �10,492.65.   Thus,  there
    was a mismatch between the income that the Appellant  had  declared  to
    HMRC with that  declared  to  the  Secretary  of  State  when  she  had
    successfully obtained further leave to remain on a  previous  occasion.
    The Respondent considered that the Appellant  had  been  dishonest  and
    accordingly refused her application  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain
    under paragraph 322(5) of the Rules.

 6. The Appellant appealed that decision and her appeal came before  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Wright. In a decision promulgated on  24th  January
    2019 the FtTJ allowed the Appellant's appeal under Article 8.  The FtTJ
    identified  that  the  appeal  turned  on  whether  the  Appellant  was
    dishonest in her dealings with the SSHD and/or HMRC. If found not to be
    dishonest, then the discretionary refusal under paragraph 322(5)  would
    not be justified.  Thus the decision to refuse her  leave  would  be  a
    disproportionate one under Article 8.

 7. The judge in his decision made several findings,  concluding  that  the
    Appellant had not acted dishonestly at the time she submitted  her  tax
    return for 2012/2013 to HMRC, but rather that she  was  suffering  from
    anxiety and panic attacks due to pressures  of  work  and  worry  about
    family members.  This had led her to submit  incorrect  information  to
    HMRC.  The unpaid tax was now being paid.  HMRC had not taken steps  to
    prosecute the Appellant for fraud, nor had  it  imposed  any  financial
    penalty.  The FtTJ allowed the appeal.

 8. The Respondent appealed that decision on two grounds:

       . The judge had made a mistake as to omit material facts

       . The judge had failed to take into account and/or resolve  conflicts
         of fact or opinion on material matters.

    Permission having been granted, the matter comes before  me  to  decide
    whether the decision of the FtTJ contains such error  of  law  that  it
    requires me to set aside the decision in order for it to be re-made.



Error of Law Hearing

 9. Before me Mr Walker appeared for the Respondent and Mr  Malik  for  the
    Appellant.  Mr Walker's submissions relied on the grounds but said that
    he accepted that the Respondent's challenge was essentially  a  reasons
    one.  Further he acknowledged that HMRC had not sought to penalise  the
    Appellant for the underpayment of tax.

10. Mr Malik submitted that the judge's findings were ones open to  him  on
    the evidence. The grounds amounted to no more than a disagreement  with
    the judge's  findings.   In  order  to  succeed  in  this  appeal,  the
    Respondent  would  have  to  show  that  the   judge's   findings   are
    perverse/irrational.  They were neither.  The judge heard evidence from
    the Appellant, the Appellant was cross-examined and the judge found her
    evidence credible. He gave adequate reasons for accepting that  at  the
    time the 2012/2013 tax return was filed with HMRC,  the  Appellant  was
    suffering from anxiety and panic attacks.  Medical  evidence  that  had
    been  submitted  supported  her  version  of  events.   The  judge  was
    therefore fully entitled to make the findings he did  and  to  conclude
    that the Appellant was not acting dishonestly.



Conclusions on Error of Law

11. I find I am in agreement with Mr Malik's submissions.   The  judge  has
    set out in some detail the evidence before him including  the  evidence
    contained in the Respondent's reasons for refusal  letter  [26  -  30].
    Furthermore he has referenced and followed the useful guidance set  out
    in R (on the application of  Khan)  v  SSHD  (Dishonesty,  tax  return,
    paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC).

12. The judge noted that the Respondent was also  under  a  misapprehension
    that the Appellant was blaming her accountant for the mistakes  on  her
    tax return.  In fact, the Appellant  had  never  sought  to  blame  her
    accountant [27].  Looking at the evidence before him, the  judge  found
    that he accepted the Appellant's account that her underpayment  of  tax
    was a mistake explained by her suffering anxiety and panic  attacks  on
    account of business/family pressures. That  being  so,  the  judge  was
    entitled to conclude  that  the  Appellant  had  given  an  explanation
    showing  that  her  miscalculation  of  tax  was  not  dishonest.   The
    Secretary of State could not prove  dishonesty.   Therefore,  paragraph
    322(5) does not apply.  I find that the findings made by the judge were
    ones which were fully open to him to make.  There is no perversity.

13. It follows therefore for the above reasons,  that  the  appeal  of  the
    Secretary of State fails.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    discloses no error of law and it stands.
