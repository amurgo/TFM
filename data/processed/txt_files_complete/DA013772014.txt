Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr K Smyth, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant has been granted permission to appeal  the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Herlihy  promulgated  on  7  April  2015
    dismissing his appeal against the decision of the  respondent  dated  8
    July 2014 to refuse to revoke a deportation order against him  dated  4
    January 2008, pursuant to paragraphs 390 and  391  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

2.   The respondent's decision to make the deportation order  was  based  on
    the appellant's conviction at Harrow Crown Court of theft on 9 December
    2005.  The appellant was sentenced to 42 months' imprisonment  and  the
    court recommended him for deportation on  23  December  2005.   He  was
    served with a notice of liability to deportation on 13  February  2007.
    His custodial sentence ended on 22 February 2007 and  he  was  detained
    under immigration powers.  Having exhausted all his appeal rights on  8
    November 2007, the respondent signed a deportation order against him on
    4 January 2008.

3.   On 18 November 2008 the appellant submitted an  application  to  revoke
    the deportation order which  was  refused  on  20  October  2009.   The
    decision attracted an in country right of appeal.  He lodged an  appeal
    against the refusal to revoke the deportation order on 2 November 2009.
     The appeal was dismissed on  27  April  2010.   As  a  result  of  the
    dismissal of two onward appeals to the Tribunal,  the  appellant  again
    became appeal rights exhausted on 30 September 2010.

4.   He failed to report on a number of  occasions  and  was  listed  as  an
    absconder on 24 May 2012.

5.   On 1 July 2013 the appellant  was  arrested  at  St.  Pancras  Eurostar
    whilst attempting to leave  the  UK  on  a  false  passport  and  false
    documents.  On 2 July 2013 he was arrested  for  fraud  and  wanted  on
    warrant (deportation).  He was convicted  at  Westminster  Magistrates'
    Court of non-payment of a confiscation order of ï¿½24,884.75  imposed  on
    him on 31 May 2006 and accrued arrears.  He was sentenced to 456  days'
    imprisonment.

6.   At the hearing before the First-tier Judge the appellant  claimed  that
    his  conviction  in  2005  generated  widespread  media  coverage.   He
    submitted that his criminal past is not something that he will be  able
    to keep hidden from the authorities in the DRC.  He also submitted that
    the First-tier Tribunal who heard his asylum claim accepted that he was
    either a member of or a supporter of the UDPS.  He claimed that  if  he
    returned to the DRC the authorities there will be aware of his criminal
    conviction and his past involvement  with  the  UDPS  and  he  will  be
    detained and ill-treated as a consequence.

7.   The judge rejected his argument.   The  judge  relied  on  the  Country
    Policy Bulletin to find that the authorities in the DRC had no interest
    in  criminal  convictions  in  countries  outside  the  DRC   only   in
    outstanding criminal offences committed within the DRC and  that  there
    is no substantiated evidence that foreign national returnees  from  the
    UK have been subject to ill  treatment  on  return  to  the  DRC.   The
    appellant was granted permission to appeal  this  finding.  However  Mr
    Smyth did not pursue the challenge in the light of the Upper Tribunal's
    decision in BM & Others (returnees  -  criminal  and  non-criminal)  CG
    [2015] UKUT 293 (IAC).  The Upper Tribunal held that a national of  the
    DRC who has acquired the status of foreign  national  offender  in  the
    United Kingdom is not, simply by virtue of such status,  exposed  to  a
    real risk of persecution or serious harm  or  treatment  proscribed  by
    Article 3 ECHR in the event of enforced return to the DRC.

8.   There was therefore one remaining ground on which Mr Smyth  relied  and
    it was this; that the judge made no findings as to the significance  of
    the respondent's disclosure to  the  DRC  Embassy  of  the  appellant's
    relationship to his mother.  This ground is based on  paragraph  37  of
    the determination where the judge held as follows:

         "37. ... I did not find the appellant's  claim  that  his  mother's
             status as a refugee would also put him at risk on  return.   I
             heard no evidence from his mother and it  is  clear  from  the
             determination of her asylum appeal that  she  was  accused  of
             supporting rebels and the events which  she  related  happened
             over six years after the appellant had left the DRC."

9.   Mr Smyth relied on paragraph 4 of his skeleton argument  where  he  had
    recited the findings made by Mrs Wynberg, Adjudicator,  who  had  found
    the appellant's mother,  Marie  Louise  Tshianda  credible  as  to  the
    account of events that occurred to her in  the  DRC.   The  appellant's
    mother was granted asylum in the UK on  22  April  2002  following  the
    success of her appeal.  Mrs Wynberg found as follows:

    (1)  She (Ms Tshianda) belonged  to  an  organisation  called  Salongo,
         which was a woman's organisation which supported  President  Mobutu
         and was banned by President Kabila;

    (2)  In 1997 she joined the RFC (Rassemblement des Femmes  Congolaise),
         which did virtually the same as  Salongo  except  that  instead  of
         supporting Mobutu it supported Kabila.  If you  wanted  to  survive
         you had to be a member of the party;

    (3)  Her problems started after the death of President Kabila.  In  May
         2001 soldiers and security people entered and  searched  her  house
         and discovered a telephone, as well as letters from  the  appellant
         who by this time had been granted exceptional leave  to  remain  in
         the UK.  The soldiers told Ms Tshianda that she was being  arrested
         because they had been told that she had communication equipment and
         was in contact with the rebels;

    (4)  She was detained at Tsapri Camp for about one and  a  half  months
         where she, along with other women, was beaten with belts;

    (5)  She was then sent to a woman's prison Shaba, which was known to be
         particularly harsh;

    (6)  Her sister travelled to visit her and bribed a guard to secure her
         escape.  On release she went to stay with  a  friend  in  Kinshasa.
         Her business no longer existed because there had  been  no  one  to
         look after it following her arrest.

10.  The skeleton argument further states that  Mrs  Wynberg  recorded  that
    "Ms Tshianda said that what made it worse was not  just  her  telephone
    because other people had telephones but it was  the  letters  from  her
    son.  The soldiers had said to her that as her son was  in  England  it
    meant that he must have been against Kabila (he had come to the  United
    Kingdom in 1997) and she must have been involved in politics too."

11.  The judge noted that  since  arriving  in  the  UK  the  appellant  has
    returned to the DRC on two occasions, the last of which  was  in  2004.
    He did not face any problems on either occasion.

12.  Mr Smyth submitted that the judge placed significant weight  on  events
    relied on by the mother six years after the  appellant  left  the  DRC.
    The point he wished to make was that the appellant's mother  was  found
    credible.  Her home had been raided in May 2001 by soldiers who found a
    telephone and letters from her son.   The  fact  that  the  appellant's
    mother escaped from the prison camp as a result of  the  payment  of  a
    bribe is significant.  The appellant's asylum appeal failed because  he
    was released but the mother escaped after the payment of a bribe.

13.  Mr Smyth drew our attention to BM, paragraph 12, wherein in  a  trilogy
    of decisions, the Upper Tribunal considered the question  of  the  risk
    pertaining to members  of  the  UDPS,  a  group  which  is  opposed  to
    President Kabila's regime and identified  three  risk  categories.   Mr
    Smyth in particular relied on paragraph 12(c)  which  those  having  or
    being perceived to have a military or political profile in  a  position
    to the government as being at risk.  He submitted that the  appellant's
    mother, having been detained under the Kabila regime, has  a  political
    profile.  The profile is that she is perceived to be an opponent of the
    Kabila regime.  The significance of this evidence is that the mother is
    still of interest to the  DRC  authorities.   Although  she  is  now  a
    British national, she is not somebody who can  be  said  to  be  of  no
    interest to the DRC authorities.

14.  Mr Smyth accepted that the appellant travelled back to the DRC  on  two
    occasions, the latest in 2004.  He said however that in  November  2013
    the respondent wrote to the DRC enclosing a travel document application
    at page 47 of the appellant's bundle and asking the Embassy to issue  a
    travel document to the appellant.  Mr Smyth submitted that the  details
    given on the travel document application  included  at  section  4  the
    details of the appellant's parents.  The application gave  the  details
    of his mother; her maiden name, married name and  district  of  origin.
    At page  55  of  the  appellant's  bundle  was  the  appellant's  birth
    certificate which also gave his mother's name.  Mr Smyth submitted that
    as a result  of  the  documents  submitted  with  the  travel  document
    application, the respondent has revealed to the  DRC  authorities  that
    the appellant is her son. He argued that the judge failed to materially
    confront adequately or at all this risk to  the  appellant.   The  only
    outcome is that this appeal should be allowed.

15.  Ms Everett submitted that the judge's decision  does  not  disclose  an
    error of law.  She acknowledged that the judge may  have  dealt  rather
    briskly with this aspect of the appellant's claim but there  was  force
    in the submission that the appellant has been back to the  DRC  on  two
    occasions since his mother was granted asylum.  There was  no  evidence
    to support a claim that family members are likely to be at  risk.   She
    questioned why  the  authorities  would  impute  to  the  appellant  an
    opposition to the current government due to the passage of time.   Even
    if we were to accept that the mother was seen as being in opposition to
    the government, it is clear from BM that the government in the  DRC  is
    looking for genuine opponents.  She submitted that at paragraph  87  of
    BM the Upper Tribunal addressed the discreet question of risk to  those
    who are considered to be opponents of the Kabila regime  by  reason  of
    their sur place activities in the United Kingdom.  Ms Everett submitted
    that we have no evidence that either the appellant or  his  mother  has
    engaged in  sur  place  activities  which  have  brought  them  to  the
    attention of the authorities in the DRC.

16.  Ms Everett submitted that although the judge did not grapple  with  the
    issue at length, her findings on the issue did not disclose a  material
    error.

Findings and Decision

17.  We find that the judge did not err in law in her decision at  paragraph
    37.  The terse manner in which  she  dealt  with  the  issue  does  not
    materially undermine her decision.

18.  We find that the Secretary of State did not reveal information  to  the
    DRC Embassy that was not already known to them.  The appellant's  birth
    certificate was issued by the DRC  authorities.   The  travel  document
    application  contained  the  same  information  that  appeared  on  the
    appellant's birth certificate.  To say that the  information  contained
    in the appellant's birth certificate and the travel document about  his
    parentage would alert the authorities to the events  that  occurred  to
    the mother in the DRC in 2001 is  a  step  too  far.   The  appellant's
    mother did not give evidence. Therefore there  is  no  evidence  as  to
    whether his mother, since 2001 and her escape from prison  through  the
    payment of a bribe, is still being sought by  the  authorities  in  the
    DRC.  She may have had a perceived political profile in  opposition  to
    the government in 2001 but there was no evidence from her that with the
    passage of time she continues to be perceived  as  having  a  political
    profile in opposition to the government.

19.  In any event the appellant returned  to  the  DRC  after  his  mother's
    arrival in the UK.  His most recent visit was in 2004.   There  was  no
    evidence that he encountered any difficulties whilst he was in the DRC.

20.  Furthermore, there was no evidence that either  the  appellant  or  his
    mother has engaged in sur place activities since  his  arrival  in  the
    United Kingdom which have brought him to the attention  of  the  Kabila
    Government.

21.  We also find that there was no evidence that family  members  of  those
    perceived to have a political profile are persecuted on return  to  the
    DRC.

22.  On the evidence that was before the judge, we find  that  her  decision
    is sustainable and discloses no error of law.

Notice of Decision

23.  The judge's decision dismissing the appellant's appeal shall stand.

24.  No anonymity direction is made.
