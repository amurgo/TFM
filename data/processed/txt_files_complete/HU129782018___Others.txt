                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. These are the appellants' appeals against the decision of  Judge  Smith
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 14th January 2019.



Background

 2. The first appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 15th May  1981  and
    the second two appellants are her children.  The third  appellant,  who
    was born on 22nd August 2010, is a qualifying child.

 3. The first appellant entered the UK  as  a  visitor  in  June  2008  and
    overstayed.  Her children were born in the UK.  On  11th  January  2018
    they made applications for leave to remain in the UK on  the  basis  of
    their private life which were refused on 30th May 2018 and it was their
    refusal which was the subject of  the  appeal  before  the  Immigration
    Judge.

 4. The judge,  in  a  lengthy  and  detailed  determination,  recited  the
    evidence both from the first appellant and her former partner Mr T  who
    is the father of the children.  He  gave  evidence  that  he  had  been
    giving her �500 per month by way of maintenance for the children  which
    he paid in cash.  There was no documentary evidence and the  judge  did
    not find it credible that some form of record would not have been  kept
    of such substantial payments.

 5. It was also Mr T's evidence that he saw the children twice  a  week  on
    Thursdays and Saturdays.  The judge observed that there was no evidence
    that he bought them Christmas or birthday  presents  or  cards  passing
    between him and the children or evidence  from  the  children's  school
    confirming that he picked them up or that he had any involvement in the
    children's education.  The judge did not accept  that  the  second  and
    third appellants had contact with their  half-brother,  their  father's
    son from his present relationship.

 6. At paragraph 91 he wrote

         "I find that the first  appellant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with the children.  Mr  T,  for  the  reasons  already
         given, does not.  If I am wrong on this point and it is found  that
         he  does  have  regular  contact  and  a  genuine  and   subsisting
         relationship with the children  then  I  find  that  he  could  not
         realistically accompany the  first,  second  and  third  appellants
         because his relationship with the first appellant has broken  down.
         He also has another child from another relationship who remains  in
         the UK.  I further find that contact by means of  electronic  means
         between Mr T and the second and third appellants whilst having some
         value  is  not  as  beneficial  to  children  as  regular  personal
         contact."

 7. The judge concluded that he would not have found it reasonable for  the
    children to relocate with the first appellant if they  had  a  parental
    relationship with their father but that was not his finding of fact.

 8. At paragraph 115 the judge said

         "Thus, the decision is finely weighted.  On the one  hand  O  is  a
         qualifying child, has never been to Nigeria and will be taken  away
         from the home he  is  used  to  and  his  schoolfriends.   Balanced
         against that he is young and will quickly make friends.  There  are
         no language impediments.  He is a Nigerian boy who is  entitled  to
         be brought up in accordance with his country's values and  customs.
         Whilst it could have been argued that there will be uncertainty for
         O in terms of accommodation his position is uncertain at the moment
         due to the first appellant's precarious  financial  position.   The
         requirement for a child to go to another country is not necessarily
         unreasonable but is  fact-specific.   Many  children  go  to  other
         countries for  a  variety  of  reasons  such  as  a  parent's  job.
         Requiring the children to go to Nigeria is not punishment  for  the
         first appellant's immigration status."

 9. On that basis he dismissed the appeal.

The Grounds of Application

10. The appellants sought permission to appeal  on  the  grounds  that  the
    judge had taken into  account  irrelevant  matters  when  reaching  his
    adverse credibility findings, namely  whether the first  appellant  was
    telling the truth in relation to her employment and whether  Mr  T  was
    telling the truth in relation to paying her maintenance.   He  attached
    too much weight to insignificant matters since it was not uncommon  for
    those living in the UK illegally to play down their employment and this
    should not have had any bearing on whether contact was actually  taking
    place or not. There was no need for detailed evidence  in  relation  to
    maintenance to have been submitted as the issue was not maintenance but
    contact.

11. Permission to appeal was initially refused  by  First-tier  Immigration
    Judge Blundell on 8th March 2019 but granted by Deputy  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Black on 22nd May 2019.

Submissions

12. Ms Hashmi relied on her  grounds  and  submitted  that  the  judge  had
    conflated the issues of  maintenance,  contact  and  employment  in  an
    impermissible way.

13. She said that the issue of contact had not been raised in  the  reasons
    for refusal letter and therefore the solicitors would not have been  on
    notice that documentary evidence ought  to  have  been  provided.   The
    reasons for refusal letter did not refer to the issue  of  whether  the
    minor appellants had contact with their father.   The  first  appellant
    had done all that was required of her in the application form,  stating
    that her ex-partner paid her accommodation costs and gave her money for
    the children as and when needed.  She had named him as  the  father  at
    all relevant points on the  form  and  had  provided  evidence  of  his
    passport and residence card.  Had further evidence  been  requested  it
    could have been provided but the solicitor was simply not aware that it
    would be such a significant issue.

14. She took me through the determination in some  detail  submitting  that
    the children should not be blamed for any shortcomings in the  mother's
    conduct and that, whilst the judge had said that he had  taken  account
    of  their  best  interests,  it  was  not  properly  reflected  in  the
    determination.  They belonged to the UK having been  born  here,  spoke
    English and had not been financially dependent  on  the  state.   Their
    father had attended court to give evidence on their behalf.

15. Mr Diwnycz defended  the  determination  submitting  that  it  was  the
    appellant's responsibility to put forward her case in  her  application
    form and she had not disclosed at that stage any  evidence  of  contact
    between her children and their father.  When asked to give  details  of
    his parental responsibility  (for  example  any  contact  or  financial
    support)  she  had  written  "financial."   Further,  when  given   the
    opportunity to give details of when he had last had  contact  with  the
    child and the nature of their  relationship,  the  box  had  been  left
    blank.

Findings and Conclusions

16. I am not persuaded that there is an error of law in this determination.



17. First, it was not an error for the judge to highlight  that  the  first
    appellant gave discrepant evidence to the Tribunal  about  whether  she
    had worked.  She initially said that she had not worked  and  then  was
    asked whether she had ever received any state benefits.   She  answered
    in the negative to both questions.  When it was  put  to  her  how  she
    could  have  survived  she  admitted  that  she  worked  as   an   Avon
    representative and also plaiting hair.  He  noted  that  in  O's  birth
    certificate  the  first  appellant  gave  her  occupation  as  dispatch
    operative - card manufacturers.

18. The fact that the first appellant was not honest  in  relation  to  her
    employment was a relevant matter in assessing  whether  she  had  given
    credible evidence in relation to her children.

19. So far as maintenance is concerned, her oral evidence was  inconsistent
    with the evidence in the application form.  In the form she  said  that
    she received income as and when needed and the amount  was  not  fixed.
    The evidence before the judge was that she  had  been  getting  �500  a
    month for two years  and  two  months  but  there  was  no  documentary
    evidence in support.  It was  open  to  the  judge  to  disbelieve  the
    appellant's case that the children's father supported her  financially.
    This was clearly  relevant in deciding the level of  contact  which  he
    enjoyed with his children.

20. The oral evidence was that he had a great deal of contact, namely three
    hours each Thursday and seven hours each Saturday. However there was no
    evidence in the form of cards or receipts  for  presents  or  from  the
    children's school.  Ms Hashmi submitted that it was not the appellant's
    evidence that Mr T collected the children from school but  it  was  his
    evidence that he saw them from 3:15 which implies to me  that  this  is
    exactly what she was saying.

21. So far as her argument that the solicitors were not on notice that this
    was an important issue  is  concerned  it  is  quite  obvious,  if  the
    appellants could establish a genuine relationship with their father who
    is in the UK, that would be a very powerful argument in favour of their
    being able to remain here.  It would  be  quite  extraordinary  if  the
    appellant's legal representatives did not advise her that such evidence
    would be crucial.

22. Ms Hashmi's argument submitted that they were not on notice because the
    issue was not raised in the reasons for refusal letter but  I  have  to
    say that the problem here is that the appellant herself  did  not  give
    any indication at all in the application form that her children were in
    regular contact with their father.  The clear implication from the form
    is that there was no such contact.

23. The weight which the judge attached to  the  evidence  was  entirely  a
    matter for him.  There is no error in his approach.  The judge examined
    the children's position and took into account their best interests as a
    primary consideration.  They would be returning  to  their  country  of
    nationality, with no language impediment and, since they are relatively
    young and not at a crucial stage in their education and  there  are  no
    health issues, the judge was entitled to find  that  it  would  not  be
    unreasonable to leave the UK.  The appellant has family there  and  the
    judge did not accept the appellant's evidence that her parents were  no
    longer alive.  The first appellant has  a  number  of  skills  and  put
    forward no reason why she could not return to Nigeria.

24. The judge reached a decision open to him and did not err in law.

Decision

The appellants' appeals are dismissed.
