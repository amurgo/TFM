Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr C Youssefian of Counsel instructed by Kothala &
                    Co (Harrow Road)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The respondent (hereafter the claimant) is  a  citizen  of  Sri  Lanka.
    She came to the  UK  in  September  2007  as  a  student  and  received
    extensions in that capacity until October 2012.  In August 2014 she was
    granted further leave for post-study work.  She was then granted  leave
    to remain under Tier 2 until August 2017.  On 14 January 2016 her leave
    was curtailed to expire on 15 October 2016.  On  15  October  2016  she
    applied for leave to remain on family and private life  grounds.   This
    was voided on 5 February 2018.  On 22 September  2017  she  varied  her
    application to indefinite leave to remain based on long residence.   On
    21 March 2018 a decision was made to refuse her leave to remain in  the
    UK.  The appellant appealed.  Her appeal was heard by  Judge  Iqbal  of
    the First-tier Tribunal.  In a decision sent on 14  December  2018  the
    judge allowed the appeal of the appellant on human rights grounds.

2.   The respondent alleged error of law on the part of the  judge  in  four
    main respects:

    (1)  that the judge had wrongly stated in paragraph 36 that the husband
         and children of the claimant ought to be granted leave in line with
         the appellant which was said to  be  clearly  outside  the  judge's
         remit;


    (2)  that the judge failed to apply the guidance given by  the  Supreme
         Court in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11 by virtue of which  only  if  there
         were  unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  could  a  person  succeed
         outside the Rules.  In this regard it was considered important that
         the judge had concluded that  the  claimant  would  not  face  very
         significant obstacles on return to Sri Lanka;


    (3)  that the judge had wrongly stated that the claimant's  appeal  was
         one in which there was "historic injustice".  It was said that  her
         conclusion that the state of the claimant's mind was the reason  as
         to why she  was  unable  to  properly  pursue  various  immigration
         applications was without any merit and inadequately reasoned;


    (4)  finally, it was contended that the judge had  failed  to  properly
         apply the considerations under Section 117B of the Immigration  and
         Nationality Act 2002 and in particular the judge erred  in  on  the
         one hand failing to attach little weight to the  precarious  nature
         of the claimant's private life, and on the other hand regarding the
         fact  that  the  claimant  speaks  English  and  that  she  may  be
         financially independent as positive factors rather than as  neutral
         factors.


    I heard pertinent submissions from both representatives.


3.   As regards ground  1,  I  concur  with  the  appellant  (hereafter  the
    Secretary of State or SSHD) that the judge erred in  stating  that  the
    husband and children ought  to  be  granted  leave  in  line  with  the
    claimant.  The issue of the  immigration  status  of  the  husband  and
    children was not before the judge as such and it was not for the  judge
    to direct anything regarding their leave.  However, I am not  persuaded
    that there was any material implications to this error, and  indeed  Mr
    Tufan has not suggested as such.  Mr Youssefian properly points to  the
    fact that in any  event  the  judge  only  stated  matters  normatively
    referring to the husband and children as being person who "ought" to be
    granted "leave in line with the claimant".

4.   As regards the second ground, it is correct  that  the  judge  did  not
    refer to the Supreme Court guidance in Agyarko.  At the same time,  the
    approach taken by the judge was clearly consistent  with  the  guidance
    given in this decision.  In particular, the judge  properly  considered
    first of all whether or  not  the  claimant  could  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules, and then went on in paragraph 28 to consider Article
    8 outside of the Rules.  It is correct that in paragraph 27  the  judge
    had concluded that there would not be very significant obstacles to the
    claimant's integration back into life  in  Sri  Lanka.   However,  that
    issue arising as it did under para 276ADE was not determinative of  the
    issue of whether or not there were compelling circumstances outside the
    Rules warranting a grant of leave.  This ground could only  succeed  if
    it can  be  shown  that  the  judge's  proportionality  assessment  was
    vitiated by legal error.

5.   Whilst the proportionality assessment made by  the  judge  outside  the
    Rules was a generous one, I agree with Mr Youssefian that it is not one
    that was outside the range of reasonable responses.  First of  all,  it
    is  clear  that  the  judge  took  into  account  a   wide   range   of
    considerations   in   assessing   whether   there    were    compelling
    circumstances.  At paragraph 33 the judge stated:

         "33. Matters I have considered as part of the balancing act are  as
             follows:


                . There is in the  Appellant's  case  a  potential  historic
                  injustice in relation to the rejection of her claim as  of
                  June  2009.   This  is  when  the  Appellant  states   the
                  Secretary of State claimed  they  had  attempted  to  take
                  funds from her account, however, claimed that they had not
                  been able to do so given there were insufficient funds  in
                  her account.  However, as I have already highlighted the I
                  have been provided with bank statements which,  show  that
                  as at the 21st May  2009,  the  Appellant  had  sufficient
                  funds to cover  that  application  and  I  have  seen  the
                  account runs up until June consistently with a balance  of
                  over ï¿½500 in the account.


                . Further, although there was a gap of one year she has  had
                  lengthy lawful residence in the United Kingdom.   The  gap
                  itself was  explained  by  exceptional  and  compassionate
                  circumstances.  I have accepted the circumstances relating
                  to her father's disappearance and the  impact  they  would
                  have had on the Appellant's state of mind.   I  also  note
                  that there has been no real challenge by the Respondent to
                  the evidence of the Appellant and I accept on balance that
                  her state of mind would have been such that she was unable
                  to properly pursue the various immigration applications at
                  that time.


                . There is some evidence that the family in  Sri  Lanka  may
                  have  had  further  difficulties  given  the   Appellant's
                  mother's asylum claim in the  United  Kingdom,  however  I
                  have been provided with no further details of this and  am
                  only  able  to  accord  it  with  limited  weight  in  the
                  balancing act.


                . I consider the Appellant and her children  share  a  close
                  relationship with her own sister and her children who  are
                  British citizens in the United Kingdom.


                . The Appellant's husband is financially stable and  owns  a
                  convenience store in the United Kingdom.


                . All their family and close friends have  relocated  abroad
                  from Sri Lanka and they have no real network on  which  to
                  rely for support in the short term or long term on  return
                  after 11 years away from the country.


                . Both children were born in the United Kingdom.  The eldest
                  child who is 5  has  some  medical  difficulties,  however
                  these are not determinative of the Article 8 claim  before
                  me.  In addition, it is of note  that  the  children  have
                  limited or no understanding of the Tamil language.   Again
                  this in itself is not a  weighty  factor,  but  considered
                  cumulatively with the other factors highlighted this  does
                  add weight to the balancing act.


                . The Appellant herself is  a  highly  qualified  biomedical
                  scientist to the extent that her continuing education will
                  be paid or by her employers".

6.   As regards the first bullet point, I  agree  with  Mr  Tufan  that  the
    judge was incorrect to portray the claimant's case as one of  potential
    historic injustice, that  concept  being  related  to  cases  in  which
    categories  of  applicants  have  fallen  outside  the  Rules  in  ways
    considered by the Secretary of State to  have  been  wrong  for  policy
    reasons.  The claimant's case was rather  one  in  which  there  was  a
    difficulty with  the  circumstances  under  which  she  had  become  an
    overstayer.  On the evidence before the judge  the  claimant  did  have
    funds in her account at the point in time when the Secretary  of  State
    voided her application for  insufficient  funds.   There  was  evidence
    produced before the judge to confirm that there  were  bank  statements
    for sufficient amounts covering this period.  As a  result,  the  judge
    had to consider whether, had it not been for this voiding, the claimant
    would have had been able to make  a  legitimate  application  based  on
    paragraph 276B on the grounds of long residence.  It was  open  to  the
    judge in  the  context  of  considering  the  claimant's  circumstances
    outside the Rules, to take the view that  there  were  exceptional  and
    compassionate circumstances for the claimant arising from her,  despite
    meeting  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  substantively,  not  having
    properly pursued the various immigration applications at that time.  It
    was equally open to the judge to consider that this was a very  weighty
    factor  when  considering  the  proportionality  of   the   Article   8
    assessment.  In that context, it was open to the judge to conclude that
    notwithstanding that there were not significant obstacles in the way of
    the  claimant  integrating   back   into   Sri   Lankan   society   and
    notwithstanding that there were no weighty factors affecting  the  best
    interests  of  the   children,   the   various   considerations   taken
    cumulatively were such as to amount to compelling circumstances.  It is
    important in this context to note that the challenge made here  by  the
    Secretary of State is a reasons challenge.  It will  be  apparent  from
    the outline I have given that there were more than adequate reasons for
    the judge's assessment.  Certainly, this was not a case  in  which  one
    could say that it was impossible for anyone reading  this  decision  to
    understand  why  and  on  what  basis  the  judge  had   assessed   the
    considerations as she did.

7.   Turning to the challenge to the judge's treatment of the  Section  117B
    considerations, I first of  all  set  out  what  the  judge  stated  at
    paragraphs 34 to 36:

         "34. Furthermore, in considering the Upper Tribunal guidance in  MK
             (section 55 - Tribunal options) Sierra Leone [2015] UKUT 00223
             (IAC) it is of note that the best interests consideration must
             be tackled first by any fact finder as a discrete issue before
             applying this to any assessment of proportionality.   In  this
             respect, I have also considered the independent social  worker
             report prepared by Stephanie Prempeh dated the 17th May  2017,
             in  which  she  concludes  that  the  children  have  not  had
             prolonged exposure to Sri Lanka or its climate  and  remaining
             in the UK would ensure significant relationships  with  family
             members would remain unaffected  and  psychological  wellbeing
             was promoted.  In addition,  that  they  no  longer  have  any
             meaningful links with Sri Lanka such as  to  establish  or  to
             ensure  a  network  which  could  support  them  during  their
             reintegration back into life in Sri Lanka and the difficulties
             faced by them and/or assist in ensuring  that  the  children's
             wellbeing is promoted.  Whilst, I take into account the age of
             the children and find it is in their best interests to  remain
             with both their parents, given their ages, I am also satisfied
             that it is relevant that they have no experience of Sri  Lanka
             and no network of family or friends that would  help  them  to
             settle in their environment  on  return,  which  could  affect
             their well-being.


         35.  In relation to Section 117B of  the  2014  Act,  I  take  into
             account that little weight must be given  to  the  Appellant's
             private life that has been established whilst in the  UK  with
             precarious leave.  However, it is  not  in  dispute  that  the
             Appellant speaks English  and  that  she  has  never  received
             public funds, having  been  supported  by  her  own  work  and
             husband's business.  I note she continues to better herself in
             respect of academic qualifications which can only  assist  her
             in relation to continuing to be economically active.


         36.  Therefore, when taking into account all  the  matters  I  have
             highlighted above, I find this is a finely balanced  case.   I
             find what tips the balance in favour of the Appellant  is  the
             immigration history that she has  highlighted,  together  with
             the fact that she has significant ties in the UK and that  the
             children were  born  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  are  fully
             integrated into life in the United Kingdom,  with  substantive
             links to return to in Sri  Lanka.   On  the  totality  of  the
             circumstances presented  to  me,  I  find  therefore  that  on
             balance the removal of the Appellant would be disproportionate
             interference  with  Article  8  rights.   For  the   sake   of
             completeness, given the Appellant succeeds in  her  appeal,  I
             find given the matters  I  have  highlighted  above  that  her
             husband and children ought to be granted leave  in  line  with
             hers".

8.   From the above it is clear that the judge did properly  direct  herself
    as regards the private life of the claimant  and  the  need  to  ensure
    little weight was given to such private life.  I do  not  see  that  in
    paragraph 35 the judge was stating that the claimant's ability to speak
    English and her financial situation were positive factors.   The  judge
    can properly be taken to have simply ensured that they were not factors
    to be weighed negatively against this particular claimant.  Further, in
    the light of the Supreme Court guidance in Rhuppiah [2018] UKSC  58,  I
    consider the claimant's to be a case in which there  was  a  degree  of
    flexibility open to the judge in respect of the immigration history  of
    the claimant since on the judge's assessment the claimant's immigration
    status would not have been precarious had the gap not occurred in  June
    2009 by virtue of her failing to provide evidence of  sufficient  funds
    to cover her application (even though such  funds  existed).   For  the
    above reasons I  conclude  that  although  generous,  this  was  not  a
    decision vitiated by material legal error.

9.   To conclude:

    The judge did not materially err in law and  accordingly  her  decision
         shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
