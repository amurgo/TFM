Representation:

For the claimant: Not represented
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Mrs Latifa, date  of  birth  13.5.81,  is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lever promulgated  on  10.10.13,  who,  on
    human rights grounds, allowed her appeal against the  decision  of  the
    respondent,  dated  20.11.12  to  refuse  her  application  for   entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom as a partner under Appendix FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard the appeal on 24.9.13.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Campbell  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    1.11.13. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein granted permission on 9.6.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 15.9.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. The appellant was not legally represented but the sponsor Mr Talib Nori
    was present.

Error of Law

 6. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Lever should be set aside.

 7. The application had been refused because of failure to comply with  the
    specified evidence requirements of Appendix FM-SE in  relation  to  the
    sponsor's financial circumstances. The claimant had to demonstrate  not
    only that the sponsor's income met the �18,600 threshold but  that  the
    evidence specified had been submitted.

 8. Doing the best he could to assist the claimant and the sponsor from the
    available documents, Judge Lever found that the sponsor's income was no
    higher than �17,540.44, as evidenced by the P60, and thus fell short of
    the  �18,600  threshold.  Further,   necessary   specified   documents,
    including correct contract of employment, bank  statements,  etc.,  had
    not been produced. The judge thus concluded at �28 that  the  appellant
    did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

 9. However, from �29 onwards the First-tier Tribunal considered the appeal
    under article 8 ECHR, following the Razgar five steps. The judge  found
    that the sponsor's income fell below the �18,600 threshold  by  only  a
    narrow margin and that had he not had certain days off work because  of
    vehicle problems he would have met the threshold. In the circumstances,
    Judge Lever concluded that it would be disproportionate to refuse entry
    clearance and thus allowed the appeal under article 8 ECHR family life.



10. Whilst this determination preceded promulgation of the  now  well-known
    principles set out in Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640  (IAC)  and  subsequent
    cases, R (on the application of)  Nagre  [2013]  EWHC  720  Admin,  was
    promulgated in March 2013. There, Sales J  found  that  the  regime  of
    rules coupled  with  the  Secretary  of  State's  published  policy  on
    exceptional circumstances "...fully accommodates  the  requirements  of
    Article 8" [�36] and, "...there is full  coverage  of  an  individual's
    rights under Article 8 in all cases by a combination of the  new  rules
    and (so far as  may  be  necessary)  under  the  Secretary  of  State's
    residual discretion to grant leave to remain  outside  the  Rules."  At
    �30, he stated, "if, after the process of applying the  new  rules  and
    finding that the claim for  leave  to  remain  under  them  fails,  the
    relevant official or tribunal judge considers  it  is  clear  that  the
    consideration under the Rules has fully addressed any  family  life  or
    private life issues arising under Article 8,  it  would  be  sufficient
    simply to say that; they would not have  to  go  on,  in  addition,  to
    consider the case separately from the Rules. If there  is  no  arguable
    case that there may be  good  grounds  for  granting  leave  to  remain
    outside the Rules by reference to Article 8, there would be no point in
    introducing full separate consideration of Article 8 again after having
    reached a decision on application of the Rules."

11. After applying the requirements of the Rules,  only  if  there  may  be
    arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside them  is  it
    necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether there are
    compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them so that
    the  decision  is  unjustifiably  harsh.  Judge  Lever  made  no   such
    assessment in his consideration of the appellant's circumstances.

12. It also appears that in allowing the appeal the judge erred in adopting
    a near-miss approach. In Miah [2012] EWCA Civ 261: Burnton LJ,  at  �26
    stated, "In my judgement, there is no Near-Miss principle applicable in
    the Immigration Rules. The  Secretary  of  State,  and  on  appeal  the
    Tribunal, must assess the strength of  an  article  8  claim,  but  the
    requirements of immigration control is not weakened by  the  degree  of
    non-compliance with the Immigration Rules."

13. It is not open to the Tribunal to allow the appeal on the  basis  of  a
    near miss. In Patel [2013] UKSC 72 Lord Carnwath said:
             "55. Thus the balance drawn by the rules may  be  relevant  to
            the consideration of proportionality......
            56.   Although the context of the rules may be relevant to  the
            consideration of proportionality....this cannot be equated with
            a formalised "near-miss" or "sliding  scale"  principle.....Mrs
            Huang's case for favourable treatment outside the rules did not
            turn on how close she had come to compliance with rule 317, but
            on the application of the family  values  which  underlie  that
            rule and are at the heart of article 8. conversely, a near-miss
            under the rules cannot provide substance to a human rights case
            which is otherwise lacking in merit.
            57.   It is important to remember  that  Article  8  is  not  a
            general dispensing power. It is to be  distinguished  from  the
            Secretary of  States'  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
            outside the rules, which may  be  unrelated  to  any  protected
            human right...."

14. In the circumstances, the narrow degree to which the claimant failed to
    meet the financial requirements of the Rules could not for that  reason
    render the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer disproportionate. It
    is clear from �31 that the proportionality finding was based  "on  this
    very narrow and single issue."

15. I thus find such errors of  law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that the determination should be set aside and remade.

16. In remaking the decision, I preserve the findings of Judge Lever as  to
    the sponsor's financial circumstances. The income  does  not  meet  the
    required minimum threshold. I further note that the claimant failed  to
    submit bank statements with the application. Judge Lever noted that the
    contract of employment did not relate to the  current  employment.  The
    claimant thus does not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

17. Before I can go on to consider the appeal outside the Immigration Rules
    on the basis of article 8, the claimant has to demonstrate  that  there
    are arguably compelling circumstances insufficiently recognised in  the
    Rules which justify granting  entry  clearance  under  article  8  ECHR
    family or private life on the basis that  the  decision  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer was unjustifiably harsh.

18. In MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, the Court of  Appeal  held
    that in relation to deportation cases the 'new' Immigration Rules are a
    complete code but involve the application of  a  proportionality  test.
    Whether that is done within the new rules or outside the new  rules  as
    part of the article 8 general law was described as a sterile  question,
    as either way the result should be  the  same;  what  matters  is  that
    proportionality balancing exercise is required to be carried  out.  The
    Court of Appeal  observed  that  it  was  inclined  to  the  view  that
    insurmountable  obstacles  (the  test  under  exception  EX1)  did  not
    literally mean obstacles  which  it  is  impossible  to  surmount,  but
    implied a reasonableness test. In other words, a  proportionality  test
    is required whether under the new rules or article 8. MF (Nigeria)  was
    followed in Kabia (MF: para 398  -  "exceptional  circumstances")  2013
    UKUT 00569 (IAC).

19. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640
    (IAC) the Upper Tribunal set out, inter alia, that on the current state
    of the authorities:


            (b)    after applying the requirements of the  Rules,  only  if
           there may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to  remain
           outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on  to
           consider  whether  there  are   compelling   circumstances   not
           sufficiently recognised under them: R (on  the  application  of)
           Nagre v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]  EWHC
           720 (Admin);


           (c)    the term "insurmountable obstacles" in provisions such as
           Section EX.1 are not obstacles which are impossible to surmount:
           MF (Article 8 - new rules)  Nigeria  [2012]  UKUT  00393  (IAC);
           Izuazu (Article 8 - new rules) [2013]  UKUT  00045  (IAC);  they
           concern  the  practical  possibilities  of  relocation.  In  the
           absence of such insurmountable obstacles,  it  is  necessary  to
           show other non-standard and  particular  features  demonstrating
           that removal will be unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.


20. It is illustrative that in Gulshan the Upper Tribunal  considered  that
    it was not unduly harsh for a husband who originated from Pakistan  but
    was now a British national, to return to Pakistan with his wife who was
    seeking leave to remain as his spouse. The panel acknowledged that  the
    couple would suffer some hardship, as he had been in the UK since 2002,
    he had worked here and was receiving a pension, and housing benefit and
    other state benefits,  some  of  which  could  not  be  transferred  to
    Pakistan.


21. In Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC),  the  Upper
    Tribunal also held:

    (i)  Failure on the part of the Secretary of State to identify  in  her
         decision any legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR does not
         prevent a court or tribunal from seeking to do so on the  basis  of
         the materials before it.

     (ii)  "Maintenance of effective immigration  control"  whilst  not  as
         such a legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR  can  normally
         be assumed to be either an aspect of  "prevention  of  disorder  or
         crime" or an aspect of "economic  well-being  of  the  country"  or
         both.

     (iii)  "[P]revention of disorder or crime" is  normally  a  legitimate
         aim both in expulsion cases where there has been  criminal  conduct
         on the part of the claimant and in expulsion cases where there have
         only been breaches of immigration law.

     (iv)  MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 held that the new  immigration
         rules regarding deportation of a foreign criminal  are  a  complete
         code. This was because  of  the  express  requirement  in  them  at
         paragraph 398 to have regard to exceptional circumstances and other
         factors.

     (v)     It follows from this that any other rule which has  a  similar
         provision will also constitute a complete code;

     (vi)   Where an area of the  rules  does  not  have  such  an  express
         mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State  for  the
         Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) ([29]-[31]  in  particular)
         and Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013]  UKUT
         640 (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after applying the  requirements
         of the rules, only if  there  may  be  arguably  good  grounds  for
         granting leave to remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8
         purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are  compelling
         circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.

22. Although the case law continues to develop,  the  current  position  is
    perhaps best expressed in paragraph 135  of   R(MM  (Lebanon))  v  SSHD
    [2014] EWCA Civ 985:

         "135.  Where the relevant group of IRs  [immigration  rules],  upon
         their proper construction provide a  "complete  code"  for  dealing
         with a person's Convention rights in the context of a particular IR
         or statutory provision, such as in the case of "foreign criminals",
         then the balancing exercise and the way the various factors are  to
         be taken into account  in  an  individual  case  must  be  done  in
         accordance with  that  code,  although  reference  to  "exceptional
         circumstances"   in   the   code   will   nonetheless   entail    a
         proportionality exercise.  But if the relevant group of IRs is  not
         such a "complete code" then the proportionality test will  be  more
         at large, albeit guided by the Huang tests and  UK  and  Strasbourg
         case law."


23. These judgments have made it clear that the question of proportionality
    must be looked at in the context of the Immigration Rules with no  need
    to go on to a specific assessment under Article 8 if it is  clear  from
    the facts that  there  are  no  particular  compelling  or  exceptional
    circumstances requiring that course to be taken. That  is  an  approach
    consistent with the Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) and Huang. Where an
    area of the Rules does not have an express mechanism, such as found  in
    deportation appeals, the approach should be  that  after  applying  the
    requirements of the Rules, only if there may be arguably  good  grounds
    for granting leave to remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8
    purposes  to  go  on  to  consider   whether   there   are   compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.

24. I have considered all the  evidence  that  was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and the findings of Judge Lever. Whilst it is unfortunate that
    the sponsor's income fell only marginally below the threshold, that was
    not the only failure. There had been significant failure to submit  the
    relevant specified evidence documents with the application to prove the
    claimed income. I note that the income claimed was significantly higher
    than that demonstrated by the documents. Whilst the claimant  no  doubt
    wishes to be reunited with the sponsor as soon as  possible,  there  is
    nothing   particularly   compelling   or   exceptional   about    their
    circumstances. It is incumbent on the claimant to meet the  same  Rules
    that apply to all other applicants. Article 8  is  not  a  shortcut  to
    compliance with  the  Rules  and  her  case  under  article  8  is  not
    strengthened by the degree to which she failed to  meet  the  Rules.  I
    also bear in mind that if the sponsor's income is as claimed, they  can
    make another application.

25.  In  all  the  circumstances,  I  find  no  compelling  or  exceptional
    circumstances in the evidence before me to justify allowing the  appeal
    under article 8 ECHR family  life.  Neither  do  I  find  the  decision
    disproportionate in light of the matters set out  above.  I  also  have
    regard to section 117B(3) of the 2002 Act, to the effect that it is  in
    the public interest It is in the public interest, and in particular  in
    the interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
    persons who  seek  to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
    financially independent, because such persons- (a) are not a burden  on
    taxpayers, and (b) are better  able  to  integrate  into  society.  The
    claimant has not shown that she meets the threshold set to  demonstrate
    financial independence. I also note that in MM (Lebanon) the  Court  of
    Appeal in reversing the Upper Tribunal decision held that the financial
    threshold was not incapable of being proportionate.

Conclusion & Decision:

26. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on
                    both immigration and on human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
