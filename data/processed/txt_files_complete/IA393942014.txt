For the Appellant:     Mr M K Mustafa (Solicitor)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Bart-Stewart, promulgated on  23rd  February  2015,  following  a
    hearing at Taylor House on 6th February 2015.  In  the  determination,
    the judge dismissed the appeal of  Md  Abdul  Kalam,  who  subsequently
    applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh, who  was  born  on  2nd  July
    1989.  He appealed against the decision of the  Respondent  dated  16th
    October 2014, that the Appellant  had  made  false  representations  in
    order to obtain leave to remain as a student in the UK from  11th  June
    2013 until 12th June 2015, in  that  his  educational  testing  service
    certificate, confirming his ability to speak the English language,  had
    been  fraudulently  obtained,  by  virtue  of  the  test  having   been
    undertaken by somebody else.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim before the judge during the Tribunal hearing  was
    that he had been shocked by the allegation  that  his  certificate  was
    fraudulently obtained because he had personally booked the test, paying
    a fee of ï¿½160 and that the test lasted for two days with listening  and
    reading tests taking place, and that he had taken the test by  arriving
    early on 20th March, with the test  taking  twenty  to  25  minutes  to
    complete (see paragraph 4 of the determination).

The Judge's Decision

 4. The judge rejected the Appellant's explanation that he  had  taken  the
    test himself for the following preeminent reasons.  First, after he had
    arrived at Heathrow Airport by flight from  Bangladesh,  the  Appellant
    had been interviewed by  the  Immigration  Officers,  during  which  he
    subsequently admitted that, "I didn't take it" (see paragraph 14).

 5. Second, there were witness statements of  two  Home  Office  officials,
    Rebecca Collings and Peter  Millington,  which  detailed  how  the  ETS
    analysed the results of the tests and decided which were undertaken  by
    proxies (see paragraph 12).  Their evidence, and particularly  that  of
    Peter Millington, was that there was clear evidence that where ETS have
    identified positive voices matches among two candidates with  different
    names, it is because one person has sat the speaking and  writing  exam
    for both candidates and  both  candidates  have  fraudulently  obtained
    their TOEIC certificate and employed deception in their application for
    leave to remain (see paragraph 16).  This was the case here.

 6. Third, whilst the Appellant at the hearing  before  Judge  Bart-Stewart
    now argued the contrary to the evidence that was presented against him,
    the judge was clear in the holding that

         "The Appellant has failed to  adequately  explain  the  discrepancy
         between the information that  he  gave  when  interviewed  on  16th
         October to the explanation that  he  now  gives.   His  Grounds  of
         Appeal made no reference to that interview,  nor  did  he  seek  to
         resile from the admissions at that stage" (paragraph 19).




 7. Finally, the judge gave consideration  to  the  Appellant's  Article  8
    rights, and the fact that the Appellant was married  to  a  Bangladeshi
    national, who has settlement in the United Kingdom,  and  they  have  a
    British national child.  The Immigration  Rules  and  Appendix  FM  and
    paragraph 276ADE were considered, as was Section 55 of the  BCIA  2009.
    The judge concluded that the Appellant and his wife had a 1  month  old
    child, and the  suggestion  that  they  could  not  enjoy  family  life
    elsewhere was not sustainable as, "there is nothing presented before me
    why it would be  unreasonable  for  the  child  to  relocate  with  his
    parents" (paragraph 22).

 8. This was expressly on the basis that, "a young child's  best  interests
    are with their parents.  The child would not  have  independent  family
    life or established any private ties" (paragraph 22).

 9. Thereafter, consideration was given to Section 19  of  the  Immigration
    Act 2014 and the public interest requirements at part 5A with  specific
    reference to Section 117B  and  the  judge  held  the  public  interest
    clearly  required  the  maintenance  of  immigration  control  in   the
    circumstances of this case.

10. The appeal was dismissed.

Submissions

11. At the hearing before me on 13th November 2015, Mr  Mustafa,  appearing
    on behalf of the Appellant, relied upon the Grounds of Appeal and  took
    me through them.  He made the following submissions.

12. First, he relied upon the case of JC (Part 9, HC 395 - burden of proof)
    China, which is to the effect that although there is a single  standard
    of proof on the balance of probabilities, it is a flexible application,
    and that the more serious the  allegation  the  stronger  must  be  the
    evidence before the court for the allegation to be proven.  Mr  Mustafa
    submitted that if the allegation here was  that  false  representations
    had been made, then the evidence had to be  stronger  than  simply  the
    witness statements of Rebecca Collings and Peter Millington,  who  were
    in any event not in attendance at this hearing.

13. Second, chapter  50  of  the  enforcement  instructions  and  guidance,
    persons liable to administrative removal  under  Section  10  (non-EEA,
    provides at paragraph 50.12) that, the evidence of deception should  be
    clear and unambiguous in order to initiate action under Section 10.  Mr
    Mustafa submitted that the  witness  statements  produced  by  the  two
    witnesses were generic and amounted to nothing more than  a  thesis  on
    how to detect fraud.

14. Third, chapter 37  of  the  enforcement  instructions  and  guidance -
    interviewing, provides (at paragraph 37.1) that,

         "if an interview takes place at a police station or in an  approved
         immigration detention accommodation, a detained person must ... ...
         be allowed a continuous period of at least eight  hours  for  rest,
         free from questioning, travel or any interruptions ... ... ...".

15. Mr Mustafa submitted that the Appellant had flown in from Bangladesh on
    a long flight, and that it is clear from the border force landing card,
    in the bundle, that he landed at 19:30  hours  and  that  an  IS81  was
    served on him, and he was thereafter interviewed at 1:20  a.m.  in  the
    morning, with no eight hour rest given to him at all.  This was a clear
    breach of the policy of the Respondent herself.

16. However, Mr Mustafa submitted that he was not claiming that the  breach
    of the policy rendered the  entire  interview  invalid.   What  he  was
    claiming was that the breach of the policy must affect the weight to be
    granted to the confession given during that interview.

17.  Finally,  there  was  the  position  of  the   child,   and   although
    consideration had been given to Section 55 of the BCIA, this  had  been
    undertaken in a formulaic manner (see paragraph 22).  Mr Mustafa relied
    both upon the established judgment in ZH (Tanzania) [2010] UKSC 4,  and
    the Tribunal decision in MK (India) [2011] UKUT  00473.   He  submitted
    that it was not reasonable to expect the Appellant's British  child  to
    relocate to Bangladesh, especially given that there was  no  low  level
    criminality which  had  been  the  subject  of  a  prosecution  by  the
    Secretary of State.  If the Razgar tests were applied then it was clear
    that the decision was disproportionate to the Appellant's interests.

18. For his part, Mr Mills submitted that  the  decision  of  the  Tribunal
    below was entirely  sustainable  for  the  following  reasons.   First,
    chapter  37  of   the   enforcement   instructions   in   relation   to
    "interviewing" was referring to interviews "at a police station" or "in
    approved immigration detention accommodation", neither of which was the
    case here, because the  Appellant  had  been  interviewed  at  Heathrow
    Airport.   The  Appellant  was  simply  interviewed  four  hours  after
    landing.  He was interviewed at the airport.  In any event,  it  was  a
    very brief interview, such that even the Appellant made  a  mistake  in
    relation to it because he claimed in his witness statement that he  was
    interviewed at 4 a.m. in the morning, rather than 1:20 a.m.,  following
    which the Appellant readily admitted that he had not taken the test.

19. Second, reliance was being placed  by  Mr  Mustafa  upon  the  flexible
    application of a single civil standard of proof in JC (China), although
    it was well-known that that decision had been disapproved by the courts
    because there really was only a  single  standard  of  proof.   It  was
    confusing to talk in  terms  of  different  levels  of  evidence  being
    required to meet this flexible standard.  In any event, this was not  a
    criminal case and there was no need to  demonstrate  a  more  than  51%
    degree of probability.

20. Third, the two  witness  statements  by  the  two  senior  Home  Office
    officials are simply intended to demonstrate how  the  fraud  detection
    process works and it was never intended to be the only evidence  relied
    upon.

21. Finally, as far as Article 8 was concerned there was no merit  in  this
    claim, because although the judge's treatment of the Article  8  aspect
    of the claim is brief at paragraph 22,  given  that  there  was  strong
    evidence of established deception,  this  would  outweigh  the  child's
    interests, even where the child was a British citizen child,  and  this
    had been recognised in ZH (Tanzania) where the child's  interests  were
    categorically stated not to be a "trump card".  As far  as  the  public
    interest  considerations  are  concerned,  the  child  may  well  be  a
    "qualifying child" but the additional test that  had  to  be  satisfied
    under the 2014 Act was whether it  was  "unreasonable"  to  expect  the
    child to relocate to  Bangladesh.   Given  that  the  Appellant's  wife
    herself was of Bangladeshi origin, and they  both  had  a  family  back
    home, the public interest did require, in circumstances where deception
    had been exercised, for the Appellant to return to Bangladesh where  he
    could enjoy his family life.  It had  to  be  bore  in  mind  that  the
    Appellant was a minister of religion and for him to have exercised  the
    deception  of  the  nature  that  he  had  was  particularly  one  that
    demonstrated a high degree of moral turpitude.

22. In reply, Mr Mustafa submitted that the Appellant could  succeed  under
    Article 8 because it was not just a question of his 1 month  old  child
    at the time of the decision which was in issue but the fact that  there
    was an older stepchild of the Appellant's wife which, in  circumstances
    where the best interests of the child must be taken into  account,  did
    require that the Appellant  be  allowed  to  remain  in  the  UK.   The
    Appellant was exercising a genuine and subsisting relationship with his
    child and his stepchild.  The decision to remove him would amount to an
    indirect removal of a British citizen child.

No Error of Law

23. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law such that I should set
    aside the decision (see Section 12(1) of  TCEA  2007)  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

24. First, the decision that the Appellant had made  false  representations
    is not based upon one single piece of evidence alone.  It is based upon
    a tried and tested system of fraud detection employed by the  ETS  head
    office, and as explained by the witness statements of two  Home  Office
    officials, Rebecca Collings and Peter Millington.   The  decision  that
    the  Appellant  was  culpable  on  account   of   having   made   false
    representations was to be determined on  a  balance  of  probabilities.
    The decision was also based upon the Appellant's own  interview  record
    which is properly chronicled in the determination  (see  paragraph  14)
    where the Appellant admitted that he  had  not  taken  the  test.   The
    judge's conclusion that the Appellant had indeed not taken the test, on
    the basis of the evidence before him, was not one that  could  remotely
    be said to be a perverse decision on the evidence.

25. Second, the suggestion that chapter 37 of the enforcement  instructions
    and guidance on interviewing requires there to be  an  eight  hour  gap
    between questioning is predicated on the reference to, "if an interview
    takes place at a police station or in an approved immigration detention
    accommodation".  The Appellant was not in a police  station  or  at  an
    approved immigration detention accommodation.  This means that what the
    Appellant said during his interview was admissible.

26. Third, the Appellant gave an account before the judge (see paragraph 4)
    which is totally at variance with what actually happened and the  judge
    rejected this account on the basis that  the  discrepancies  could  not
    properly be accounted for at the  hearing  before  the  judge,  and  in
    particular the Appellant's Grounds of Appeal made no reference  to  the
    interview, which has subsequently formed  such  a  large  part  of  the
    challenge to the judge's conclusions, and nor did  he  seek  to  resile
    from the admissions that he had made (see paragraph 19).

27. Finally, there is the position of his wife and  British  citizen  child
    which goes to a consideration of  his  human  rights  claim  under  the
    Immigration Rules at Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE and Section 55 of
    the BCIA 2009.  The judge (at paragraphs 22 and 23) had  proper  regard
    to all the relevant issues here and rejected the  claim.   Two  matters
    are significant in this respect.  First, the Appellant has to show  not
    only that there is a  British  citizen  child  but  that  it  would  be
    "unreasonable" to expect the child to relocate with  the  Appellant  to
    Bangladesh.  Although  the  judge  does  not  expressly  refer  to  the
    decision, the case of Zoumbas [2013] UKSC 74 is most important in  this
    regard in that it develops the law a stage further from  ZH  (Tanzania)
    and makes it clear that, although the best interests of the child is to
    be with his or her parents, where the children are particularly  young,
    then the child's going to the home country with the parent, does not in
    any way detract from the requirement of observing the  "best  interests
    of the child".  In Zoumbas the children concerned were much older  than
    this particular British citizen child.  Mr Mustafa has drawn  attention
    to a stepchild who is much older,  but  no  such  argument  was  raised
    before the judge, and no particular submission was  developed  in  this
    regard to the stepchild of the  Appellant,  such  as  to  suggest  that
    requiring the Appellant and his family to go to Bangladesh would in any
    way be deemed to be "unreasonable".

28. Second, regard was had  to  Section  117B  of  the  2014  Act  and  the
    maintenance of immigration control.  Mr Mills submitted that  the  fact
    that the Appellant was a minister of religion was particularly  telling
    against him in a case where false representations  had  been  made  and
    fraudulent conduct engaged in, as this is one particular attribute that
    one would expect to be especially salient in a man of faith who was  in
    a position  of  religious  leadership.   It  is  unnecessary  for  this
    Tribunal to decide this point.  Suffice it to say, that the  judge  was
    entitled to conclude as he did at paragraph 23  and  to  say  that  the
    public interest considerations required the maintenance of  immigration
    control in this case.

Decision

29. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  judge's  decision.   The
    determination shall stand.

30. No anonymity direction is made.
