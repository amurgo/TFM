Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr H Ndubuisi, of Drummond Miller, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs S Saddiq, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Fiji, born on 17th April 1980.  He served
    in the British Army from January 2000  until  2nd  December  2011.   He
    applied on 2nd December 2011 for indefinite leave to remain as a former
    member of HM Forces  but  that  was  refused  because  of  two  unspent
    convictions.  His appeal against that  refusal  was  allowed.   On  6th
    September 2012, he was granted discretionary leave for three years.

 2. On 4th September 2008, the appellant was convicted of assault to injury
    at Edinburgh Sheriff Court and fined ï¿½300.  On 28th April 2011, he  was
    convicted of battery at an army summary hearing at Inverness and  given
    30 days' detention.   On  17th  November  2014,  he  was  convicted  at
    Edinburgh Sheriff Court of assault to injury and robbery with a  racist
    aggravator.  He was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment.

 3. The respondent made a deportation order  against  the  appellant  as  a
    foreign criminal, and refused his  human  rights  claim.   Reasons  are
    explained in a notice  dated  and  served  on  29th  April  2015.   The
    respondent considered that the public interest required deportation  in
    terms of paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules, and the  private  life
    exception contained in paragraph 399A was not met.  As  the  exceptions
    to deportation did not apply, consideration was given to whether  there
    were "very  compelling  circumstances"  such  that  he  should  not  be
    deported.  The appellant  had  made  representations  based  on  having
    family members in the UK (as he does, although his wife and son live in
    Fiji).  He had also represented that he  was  experiencing  significant
    psychological and mental health difficulties arising from his  time  in
    the army, but he produced only an e-mail from Jason Wallace  (a  social
    worker) of Veterans First Point/NHS which was not a  formal  diagnosis.
    The social work report prepared for the court said that  the  appellant
    described  himself  as  being  in  good  physical  and  mental  health.
    Although the sources suggested that he might have an  alcohol  problem,
    counselling and support groups were  available  in  Fiji.  Nothing  was
    found to outweigh the significant public interest in deportation.

 4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In relation to  the
    human rights aspect his grounds were:

         "Decision is incompatible with section 6  Human  Rights  Act  1998.
         The appellant has established significant private life in  the  UK.
         Has  served  in  HM  Forces  for  over  eleven  years.   There  are
         significant  obstacles  to  return   to   Fiji.    Suffering   from
         psychological problems with time in the army."

 5. Under the heading "New Matters", the appellant said:

         "Decision  will  be  incompatible  with  paragraph   399   of   the
         Immigration Rules."

 6. First-tier Tribunal Judge Wallace dismissed the appellant's appeal by a
    determination promulgated on 3rd September 2015.

 7. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal on the following grounds:

         "1.  FTJ erred in law in expressly excluding to  consider  relevant
             evidence and consideration and assessing whether the appellant
             meets  the  terms  of  Immigration  Rules  and  paragraph  398
             particularly as it relates to  whether  there  are  compelling
             circumstances.

          2. ... At paragraph 34 ... FTJ stated:

                  "All the witnesses ... came across as being  very  genuine
                  and none  of  them  tried  to  deny  ...  the  appellant's
                  responsibility for his actions.  However, the task  before
                  me is to consider the facts ... as they pertained  to  the
                  deportation  order.   I  cannot  look  to  the  historical
                  circumstances."

          3. In light of the above conclusion, FTT ... expressly failed  to
             take  into  account   the   consultant   psychiatric   report;
             appellant's long military record with the British  Army  which
             formed the most important evidence ... addressing the question
             of ... compelling circumstances.  The psychiatric report  sets
             out in detail that  the  appellant  is  suffering  from  post-
             traumatic stress disorder  arising  from  experiences  in  the
             British Army for twelve years which required his engagement in
             conflict  zones  (Iraq  four  tours,   Afghanistan,   Northern
             Ireland, Kuwait etc).  The  report  ...  indicated  that  upon
             discharge  the  appellant  was  not  provided  with   relevant
             psychiatric intervention by the army who  have  since  changed
             their policy ...  Further evidence was provided  by  Mr  Jason
             Wallace ... FTT failed to take these into account or  indicate
             what weight if any was accorded ...

          4. Significantly, the conclusion at paragraphs 38 and 29 did  not
             take into account the evidence in the psychiatric  report  and
             the witnesses ...

          5. The FTJ further failed to consider paragraph 398 of the  Rules
             which  is  intended  to  recognise  circumstances   that   are
             sufficiently compelling to outweigh the  public  interest  but
             which do not fall within paragraphs 399 and 399A ...  In  SSHD
             v AJ EWCA Civ 1638 paragraph 46 the Court of Appeal stated:

                  "In my view the Upper Tribunal should have approached  the
                  assessment of the claim under Article 8 by application  of
                  the new Rules and in particular (since the appellant could
                  not bring himself  within  paragraphs  399  and  399A)  by
                  asking itself whether there were very compelling  reasons,
                  within   the   exceptional   circumstances   rubrics   and
                  paragraphs 398, to outweigh the strong public interest  in
                  deportation ..."

             ... see also paragraphs 25, 28 and 29  of  Chege  [2015]  UKUT
             00165 which was before the FTT ...

          6. The FTJ's finding at paragraph 38 of the appellant  cannot  be
             seen to have socially and culturally integrated into  life  in
             the UK is significantly flawed in failing to take into account
             the significant period that the appellant  has  spent  in  the
             UK."

 8. In a Rule 24 response to the grant of permission the respondent argued:

             "... The judge ... effectively dealt  with  the  exceptions  to
             deportation ... in paragraphs 399 and 399A ... there are  prime
             facia  no  compelling  circumstances  over  and   above   these
             paragraphs by means of which the appellant could succeed.   The
             failure to deal with the content of paragraph 398 is not in the
             circumstances of the instant case a material error of law."

 9. Mr Ndubuisi submitted that the grounds  made  two  fundamental  points.
    The eventual conclusion at paragraph 42 is reached on  the  basis  that
    paragraph 399A of the Rules was not met, it having been  accepted  that
    the appellant did not fall within the exception in paragraph 399.  That
    overlooked paragraph 398, which required the judge to consider  whether
    nevertheless the public interest was  outweighed  by  "very  compelling
    circumstances over and above those  described  in  paragraphs  399  and
    399A".  Those circumstances  were  the  appellant's  military  history,
    resulting in PTSD.  The second fundamental error  was  that  the  judge
    expressly excluded those circumstances.  That was what she meant by the
    last sentence of paragraph 34.  Once the appellant's criminal offending
    was put into context of his military history and PTSD, it could be seen
    that the judge had gone wrong.

10. I enquired what evidence was put before the First-tier  Tribunal  about
    the  likelihood  of  treatment  and  rehabilitation  if  the  appellant
    remained in the UK.  Mr Ndubuisi said that this was  contained  in  the
    psychiatric report.  I also asked what information there had been about
    facilities in Fiji.  Mr Ndubuisi said that no such information had been
    before the First-tier Tribunal.  He said that "arguably at  least"  the
    obligation was on the UK government through the Ministry of Defence  to
    provide the appellant with such facilities as he might require for  his
    recovery, and the  evidence  had  suggested  that  his  case  would  be
    followed up if he remained in the UK.

11. (It emerged at this point of the submissions  that  the  appellant  has
    recently been removed to Fiji.   That  of  course  has  no  bearing  on
    whether there has been error of law by the First-tier Tribunal.)

12.  Finally,  Mr  Ndubuisi  submitted   that   the   First-tier   Tribunal
    determination should be set aside and a further hearing fixed  (whether
    in the FtT or in the UT, he did not say) for evidence to be led with  a
    view to making a fresh decision.  Mr Ndubuisi accepted that  there  has
    been no application to lead any further evidence,  but  suggested  that
    the  opportunity  should  be  given  to  provide  information  on   the
    availability of psychiatric treatment in Fiji.

13. Mrs Saddiq submitted that the judge  took  into  account  all  relevant
    evidence.  She referred to the psychiatric report by Dr Alex  Quinn  at
    paragraph 21.  She mentioned the e-mail correspondence with the support
    worker, Mr Wallace, at paragraph 19.  Although she had  not  explicitly
    set out the further test of very compelling reasons  going  beyond  the
    exceptional circumstances covered by the Rules, that was  a  very  high
    test indeed.  The appellant's wife and son live in Fiji.   Although  he
    has not returned there since he left the army, that is where he used to
    spend his leave.  There is no doubt a public interest in providing care
    for discharged soldiers who have problems arriving from their  service,
    but the appellant produced no evidence of any policy of the Ministry of
    Defence of which he should have been  given  the  benefit.   There  was
    little evidence that he would take advantage of facilities available to
    him in the UK, or to explain why he had not done so while here, and  no
    evidence that he might not be able to  obtain  appropriate  psychiatric
    assistance in Fiji.  It was implicit in the determination that the same
    conclusion would have been reached even if the issue of very compelling
    reasons had been specifically addressed, so any error was not material.
     Alternatively, if the decision did have to be re-made, that should  be
    carried out on the evidence which the appellant had chosen to  produce.
    Any case based on inadequacy of psychiatric  services  in  Fiji  should
    have been investigated long before now.

14. Mr Ndubuisi in reply said that the judge might  have  referred  to  the
    evidence, but that was not the same as assessing it.   The  psychiatric
    evidence was left out of the eventual conclusions.   This  was  a  very
    unusual case which might succeed on the basis of private  life  in  the
    UK, even although the appellant's closest  family  life  was  based  in
    Fiji.  The test of very compelling reasons was a high one, but  it  was
    not impossible.  He reiterated that there  was  a  public  interest  in
    seeing that the Ministry of Defence faithfully discharged its duties to
    ex-servicemen, and that a further hearing  should  be  fixed  at  which
    additional evidence might be led.

15. I reserved my determination.

16. The appellant's case has taken a long time to crystallise.  His grounds
    of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal did not recognise that to  succeed
    he would have  to  show  very  compelling  circumstances  in  terms  of
    paragraph 398, over and above those going to family life  in  paragraph
    399 and those going to private life in 399A of the Rules.  The ultimate
    hurdle should have been obvious to his representatives from the  start.
    It  emerges  very  clearly  from  the  structure  of  the  respondent's
    decision.

17. The grounds show nothing  wrong  with  the  judge's  finding  that  the
    appellant is not socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  UK.   It
    would  be  idle  to  suppose  that  there  are  any  obstacles  to  his
    integration, or reintegration, into Fiji.  The grounds of appeal to the
    First-tier Tribunal in respect of significant obstacles  to  return  to
    Fiji were far-fetched.

18. It is not clear to me what the judge meant by saying that she could not
    look to the historical circumstances.  However, I do not think that she
    thereby excluded from her assessment anything relevant  which  she  was
    invited to consider.

19. Item 9 at pages 31 to 34 of the appellant's inventory of productions in
    the First-tier Tribunal is  a  report  by  Dr  Alex  Quinn,  consultant
    psychiatrist of Veterans First Point, NHS Lothian,   addressed  to  the
    medical centre at HM Prison Edinburgh.  The author considers  that  the
    appellant meets the criteria for combat related PTSD.   He  notes  that
    the army has changed its process  for  dealing  with  such  traumatised
    individuals since 2008 and wonders if the  appellant  might  have  been
    picked up if current process had applied.  The author says:

         "I find it somewhat uncomfortable that we are considering detaining
         this man for deportation after close to twelve  years  of  military
         service ... I would be happy to review him in the community  should
         he be released."

20. I note that the judge recorded at paragraph  12  of  the  determination
    that the appellant said he was scared of the trauma his return to  Fiji
    might cause to his wife and child, and  that  he  believed  that  after
    proper counselling he would be in a good  emotional  and  psychological
    state to have a relationship with his wife and son.  I also  note  that
    at paragraph  20,  evidence  is  recorded  from  Mr  Wallace  that  the
    appellant had said he would engage fully with alcoholic services within
    the prison system.

21. That was the height of the evidence on which the appellant  might  have
    made his case of very compelling circumstances.  It is a  high  target,
    although, as Mr Ndubuisi observed, it cannot be an impossible one.  The
    case has a sympathetic aspect in  the  underlying  suspicion  that  the
    appellant may have been let down by the public authorities; but  it  is
    no more than a suspicion, and there is very little  to  show  that  the
    appropriate reparation might be for the appellant to remain in  (or  be
    returned to) the UK.

22. A case is perhaps conceivable along the lines of (a) a  public  failure
    to diagnose and treat the appellant at the right time;  (b)  facilities
    now available for  effective  treatment  here;  (c)  his  conscientious
    interest in taking advantage of such  treatment;  and  (d)  absence  of
    facilities for effective treatment in Fiji.  However, such a  case  was
    barely outlined either in terms  of  the  legal  framework  or  on  the
    evidence in the First-tier Tribunal.

23. I am not inclined to  find  material  error  where  the  case  was  not
    developed to a viable point in the First-tier Tribunal; and it is plain
    that on such evidence as there was, the judge would have  come  to  the
    same conclusion, even if the test in paragraph 398  had  been  squarely
    addressed before her.

24. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

25. No anonymity order has been requested or made.

                           25 November 2015
