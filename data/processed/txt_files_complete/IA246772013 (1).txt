                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the claimant: Mr E Wilford, instructed by GR Law UK Immigration
Services
For the appellant:     Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Karen Ho Man Au, date of birth 5.3.90, is  a  citizen  of
    New Zealand.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Wilson, who allowed the claimant's  appeal
    against the decision of the respondent, dated 30.5.13,  to  refuse  her
    application made on 20.9.12 for leave to remain in the UK on the  basis
    of  10  years  long  residence,  pursuant  to  paragraph  276B  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 3. The Judge heard the appeal on 26.11.13.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Page granted permission to appeal on 16.4.14.

 5. Thus the matter came before me on 2.6.14 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 6. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Wilson should be set aside.

 7. The grounds of application  for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal raise a number of issues in  submitting  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge erred in law in allowing the appeal under Article 8.

 8. In particular, the errors highlighted in the grounds of application for
    permission to appeal are that the judge, (1) "allowed the appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules (Article 8 - Appendix FM);" (2) had regard to  an
    irrelevant consideration in the proportionality assessment, namely  the
    established status of the Anglican Church in the UK; and (3)  erred  in
    his  assessment  of  the   public   interest   for   the   purpose   of
    proportionality.

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Page found, "an arguable  error
    of law in the balancing exercise that the judge made  in  allowing  the
    appeal under Article 8 in giving much weight to the  appellant's  faith
    and church activities in the UK. The judge's reasoning at paragraphs 24-
    48 I have had difficulty following. I do not have to decide the  merits
    of the respondent's appeal at this stage. So fortunately I do  not,  at
    this, the permission stage,  have  to  wrestle  any  further  with  the
    question as to whether the UK is "both secular and divine" - or if  the
    "Anglican tradition reflects an integral part of the United Kingdom  as
    a society" or whether the appellant's activities as  an  organ  scholar
    were a relevant consideration under Article 8.  The  respondent  argues
    that the  judge  erred  in  law  when  weighing  these  issues  in  the
    appellant's favour and allowing the appeal under  Article  8.  All  the
    grounds of appeal can be argued."

10. Like Judge Page, I found great  difficulty  in  following  the  logical
    course of the determination.

11. It appears that after summarising the evidence the judge  concluded  at
    �19 that, because of her absences from the UK, the claimant  could  not
    meet the Immigration Rules under paragraph 276B in respect of  the  10-
    year long residence provision. No issue is taken by  either  side  with
    that finding.

12. Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach)  [2013]  UKUT  00640
    (IAC) was not promulgated until 17 December 2013 and thus Judge  Wilson
    cannot be criticised for  failing  to  follow,  with  Shahzad  (Art  8:
    legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC),  the  approach  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal that the Immigration Rules are to be regarded  as  a  complete
    code and there is no need to consider article 8 private and family life
    rights outside the Rules unless there are compelling circumstances  not
    adequately recognised within the  Rules  so  that,  exceptionally,  the
    decision of the Secretary of State would be unjustifiably harsh.  Prior
    to those cases, the approach was to first consider an appeal under  the
    Immigration Rules before going on to  consider  article  8  ECHR  as  a
    second stage.

13. However, in the determination  Judge  Wilson  seems  to  have  confused
    family and private life. It is clear that  there  was  no  family  life
    claim in this case. Thus references at �20 onwards to Appendix  FM  and
    GEN 1.1 are entirely irrelevant.

14. Before proceeding to consider the claimant's private life  claim  under
    article 8 ECHR, the judge should have first  dealt  with  private  life
    under the Immigration Rules, pursuant to paragraph  276ADE.  The  judge
    eventually did so, at �30 of the determination, addressing both  length
    of residence and ties to New Zealand. It can be inferred that the judge
    did not accept that the appellant met  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    276ADE.

15. At �21 of the  determination  the  judge  went  on  to  find  that  the
    Secretary of State had failed to make any assessment of the  claimant's
    individual characteristics  before  issuing  removal  directions  under
    section 47. The judge suggested that  this  amounted  to  the  decision
    being not in accordance with the law  such  that  it  could  have  been
    returned to the Secretary of State to re-make the decision, but that he
    was not asked to do so. I find that the judge misdirected himself as to
    the application of MF (Nigeria) in suggesting  that  the  Secretary  of
    State had to consider the claimant's  articles,  8,  9  and  10  rights
    before making the removal decision. However,  if  the  judge  concluded
    that the decision was not in  accordance  with  the  law,  it  did  not
    require the request of one of the parties before it could  be  returned
    to the Secretary of State. The correct decision in  such  circumstances
    would have been to allow the appeal to the limited  extent  that  there
    was no valid decision and that it remained for the Secretary  of  State
    to make a decision which was in accordance with the law. In any  event,
    I find the entire discussion in �21 confused and difficult to follow.

16. Given that this was a private life claim under  article  8,  I  do  not
    follow why the judge went on to consider articles 9, 10, and even 13. I
    bear in mind that at �24 the judge explained that it  was  because  the
    attributes asserted by the claimant require consideration of all  three
    as a reflection of the claimant's private and public  religious  belief
    exhibited through her performance of church music. However,  I  do  not
    accept the judge's statement at �36  that  because  he  considered  the
    claimant's need to demonstrate her religious belief so well  entrenched
    articles 9 and 10 had to be considered along with article 8.

17. I fail to see how the decision of the Secretary of State to refuse  the
    application made under the long residence  provisions,  an  application
    doomed to failure under the Immigration Rules,  engaged  the  qualified
    rights under articles 9 and  10  in  relation  to  freedom  of  though,
    conscience and religion, or freedom of expression, if that is what  the
    judge intended to convey. As a citizen of  New  Zealand,  the  claimant
    would be  free  to  exercise  her  article  9  and  10  rights  without
    hindrance. Neither was it at all necessary to consider article 9 and 10
    in order to take into account the particular features of the claimant's
    private life.

18. I find that in reaching the conclusions, at �34 in relation to  article
    9 and �35 in relation to article 10, that there  was  no  justification
    for interference with the claimant's rights, the judge misled  himself.
    The judge had failed to clearly  identify  to  what  inference  he  was
    referring. It may be that  the  judge  concluded  that  the  claimant's
    particular talents and attributes were so special and unusual that  she
    could only exercise her article  9  and  10  rights  by  composing  and
    playing traditional Anglican choral music in the UK. This may  be  what
    the judge intended when stating at �36 that, "I am satisfied to exclude
    the religious faith displayed and enhanced through sacred  music  would
    not be giving due recognition to the appellant's  attributes.  On  that
    basis I am satisfied that no reasoned interference with the appellant's
    present position having regard to the limited provision of article 9(2)
    could be justified."

19. However, at �37 the judge appeared to reach  the  conclusion  that  the
    claimant had failed to establish that the decision interfered with  her
    religious practice and set out  reasons  in  the  following  paragraphs
    before reaching the conclusion at �40 that the articles 9 and 10 claims
    failed. As Lord Bingham made clear in Ullah and Do [2004] UKHL 26, when
    considering the qualification of the right under Article 9.2 (and other
    such qualified rights), the balance is heavily weighted  in  favour  of
    the decision  being  proportionate  and  indicated  that  decisions  in
    pursuance of immigration control will be proportionate in "all  save  a
    small minority of exceptional cases."

20. After considering �40, I  do  not  understand  why  at  �41  the  judge
    returned to consideration of article 9 interference, finding  that  the
    Secretary of State did not make out that the claimant's presence in the
    UK was sufficiently detrimental for a justification  for  article  9(2)
    interference.

21. I do not understand why the judge  thought  it  necessary  to  add  the
    contents of �33 of the determination, where he  suggests  that  as  the
    established church of the UK he had to recognise its special and unique
    nature underpinning the historical and cultural traditions of  the  UK.
    At �46 the judge added, that the UK was both  secular  and  divine  and
    that the Church of England is an established church has to be give  due
    recognition because the Anglican tradition reflects an integral part of
    the UK as a society. Those are views that may or may not be agreed with
    by others,  but  they  are  irrelevant  to  the  consideration  of  the
    appellant's  private  life  claim.  As  Mr  Wilford  accepted  in   his
    submissions,  the  claimant's  membership  and  involvement  with   the
    Anglican church held no more  or  particularly  special  value  in  any
    article 8 proportionality assessment  than  would  her  membership  and
    activity in any  other  religion  or  indeed  organisation  engaged  in
    promoting the public good. I find that the judge was, or certainly gave
    the impression that he was, according much greater significance to  the
    claimant's faith and the practice of it than  he  properly  could.   In
    saying that, the claimant's private life has to encompass  the  pursuit
    of her faith, as it is, obviously, part of her private life.

22. In relation to article 8,  at  �43  the  judge  found  that  given  the
    claimant's long-standing connection with the UK and the nature  of  her
    private life, article 8 was engaged. At �44 and �45 the judge could not
    identify any underlying public interest in this case other than need to
    maintain a fair system of immigration control. However, whilst  denying
    that this was a near miss case, the judge considered that there was  no
    Immigration Rules that reflected the claimant's position  with  a  very
    unusual set of circumstances.

23. In relation to article 8 proportionality at �46  of  the  determination
    the judge misdirected himself as  to  the  weight  to  be  attached  to
    immigration control, suggesting that he could not ascertain what impact
    the claimant could have on immigration control given that her  post  is
    not an active economic position that  would  attract  applicants  other
    than those who wished to follow a religious path. The judge ignores the
    clear  principle  that  the  maintenance  of  a  generally   applicable
    immigration policy is, by indirectly protecting the economic well-being
    of the state, a legitimate aim for the purposes of article 8. It is not
    diminished as a legitimate aim because there are  few  people  who  may
    wish to follow the claimant's path, although there was no  evidence  on
    that issue. Even if  there  were  no  others  who  might  take  up  the
    claimant's position and even if she  had  no  personal  impact  on  the
    overall or macro level of economic well-being, it remains a  legitimate
    aim  and   consideration.   It   would   be   wrong   and   fundamental
    misunderstanding to assess that legitimate aim by the particular 'cost'
    to the state of any individual  claimant.   I  am  satisfied  that  �46
    amounts to an error of law.

24. More troubling in �46 are the references, previously cited, to the role
    of the Anglican church as part of the composition of the UK and that as
    an established church it must be given due recognition. I am  concerned
    that the judge was according greater weight  to  the  claimant's  faith
    because  it  was  part  of  the  Anglican  tradition  which  the  judge
    considered to be an integral part of UK society. There is no reason why
    the established church should have any  greater  recognition  than  the
    faith of any other claimant.

25. I have struggled to understand what the judge  intended  to  convey  in
    this paragraph of the determination. I am concerned that judge  appears
    to state that the legitimate aim has to reflect the greater  status  of
    the Anglican Church in the UK. This seems to me  to  be  equivalent  to
    over-inflating the value to be taken into  account  of  the  claimant's
    involvement with the Anglican faith whilst at the same time  minimising
    the significance of the legitimate aim in immigration control, for  the
    same reason. I am not clear that this is a  proportionality  assessment
    at all, but rather a finding that the  Secretary  of  State  failed  to
    demonstrate that the decision was a  necessary  interference  with  the
    claimant's private life. Whether it was or was  not  a  proportionality
    assessment, I  find  that  this  paragraph,  together  with  the  other
    paragraphs referred to above,  contain  such  confusion  of  article  8
    principles as to amount to material errors of law.

26. Finally, in the summary, the judge purports to allow the  appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules but referencing "Article 8 -  Appendix  FM,"  and
    then to additionally allow the appeal under article 8 ECHR. It  is  not
    clear what Immigration Rules the judge was referring to, as it  appears
    that he dismissed the appeal under both paragraphs 276B and  276ADE  of
    the Immigration Rules. If the appeal succeeded  under  the  Immigration
    Rules, there was no purpose in going on to  consider  article  8  ECHR.
    Further, there was no claim to family life  and  thus  the  only  claim
    article 8 could relate to is private life under  paragraph  276ADE.  Of
    course, Appendix FM has no application to this appeal at all.

27. In all the circumstances, and for the reasons stated, I find  that  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved  such  error
    of law that it should be set aside and remade.

28. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the findings of fact and  the
    conclusions drawn are unclear on crucial issues  at  the  heart  of  an
    appeal, as they are in this case, effectively  there  has  not  been  a
    valid determination of those  issues.  The  errors  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision vitiate all other findings and the  conclusions  from
    those facts so that there has not been a  valid  determination  of  the
    issues in the appeal.

29. In all the circumstances, I  consider  the  appropriate  course  is  to
    relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal. I do
    so on the basis that this is a case which  falls  squarely  within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the parties of a fair  hearing  and  that
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding  which  is  necessary
    for the decision in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

30. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the appeal to be determined afresh in the First-
                    tier Tribunal.

Consequential Directions

31. The appeal is to be relisted on 7.11.14 in the First-tier  Tribunal  at
    Hatton Cross before any First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  other  than  Judge
    Wilson.

32. No findings of fact are preserved and the appeal is  to  be  determined
    afresh.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be determined.
