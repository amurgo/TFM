Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Gayle, Assistant Solicitor with Elder Rahimi
For the Respondent:    Mr J Kingham, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a female who was born on 29th March, 1986 and  who  is
    a citizen of Iran.

2.   The appellant  left  Iran  illegally  in  March  or  April,  2012,  and
    travelled to Turkey where she remained  for  three  months.   She  then
    travelled by air to Spain using a passport which  was  not  hers.   She
    remained there until 2nd September, 2012, when she  then  travelled  to
    the United Kingdom.

3.   On her arrival in the  United  Kingdom  the  appellant  was  unable  to
    produce a passport or documentation to Immigration Officers and claimed
    asylum.

4.   The respondent considered, but rejected, the appellant's  asylum  claim
    and on 1st October, 2012 decided to issue directions for  her  removal.
    It is that decision which the  appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Her  appeal  was  heard  on  25th  January,  2013.   In  his
    determination, promulgated on 7th February, 2013,  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  Mark-Bell  dismissed  her  appeals   on   asylum   grounds,   on
    humanitarian protection grounds and on human rights grounds.

5.    Lengthy  grounds  of  appeal  were  submitted   by   the   appellant's
    solicitors.  For completeness they are produced in the Appendix of this
    determination.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Froom granted  permission  to
    appeal, because he thought it was arguable that the judge's conclusions
    about plausibility, particularly at paragraphs  27  and  29,  were  not
    firmly based  on  evidence,  but  based  instead  on  the  judge's  own
    assumptions about what might happen in Iran.

6.   Mr Gayle relied on his grounds and told me that the judge had erred  in
    what he had said at paragraph 29 of  the  determination  by  suggesting
    that a Basij would not try to injure the appellant with scolding water.
     The judge made assumptions which he was not entitled to do.

7.   At paragraph  23  the  judge  noted  that  during  the  course  of  the
    appellant's asylum interview, she gave the date of  an  incident  which
    led to her detention overnight as being 25/11/1389.  In  the  Gregorian
    calendar this is said to be 14th February, 2011.

8.   However, in a letter written by the appellant's previous solicitors  on
    19th September, 2012, before the asylum interview  was  conducted  with
    the  appellant,  they  stated  that,  "her  first  incident  with   the
    authorities was in 1389, exact month/day unknown.  She was arrested  on
    this occasion".  Mr Gayle  said  that  the  judge  was  being  critical
    because the  appellant  had  actually  given  the  correct  date.   The
    appellant had explained at the hearing that she had only  had  a  short
    meeting with her representatives and she claimed that she had told them
    that the incident had taken place on  25  Bahman  1389  which,  in  the
    Gregorian calendar is 14th February, 2011.  The judge was  critical  of
    the appellant and claimed  that  her  representatives  would  not  have
    ignored the precise date had she given them it.  The judge  found  that
    the appellant's credibility was undermined by contradictions  made  not
    by the appellant, but by her solicitors.

9.   Mr Gayle suggested  that  the  judge's  findings  at  24  and  25  were
    insufficiently reasoned by the accounts given  by  the  appellant  were
    plausible.  At paragraph 24 the judge found that he was  not  satisfied
    that the appellant was encouraged to attend two demonstrations in  2011
    and 2012 by the influence of her fiancï¿½.  At 25 the judge refers to the
    appellant describing her father's disapproval following  her  detention
    in 1389 of her relationship with the young man and her  involvement  in
    politics.  The judge noted that the appellant's evidence was  that  she
    decided to dedicate herself to  her  study  until  she  qualified,  but
    claimed that that was inconsistent with evidence that she would involve
    herself in political demonstrations in February 2011 and February  2012
    when she was still trying to obtain a place on a lawyer's  postgraduate
    training course.  He went on to say it  was  particularly  inconsistent
    that a person  with  the  appellant's  claimed  profile  would  provoke
    members of the Basij at a second demonstration in 2012  when  they  had
    shown no interest in her group and were merely withdrawing cash from  a
    bank ATM machine.  The judge went on to find that he  agreed  with  the
    respondent that the Basij would not act  as  the  appellant's  evidence
    would have it.  Mr Gayle suggested that the judge  has  simply  assumed
    how they would react.  There are  insufficient  reasons  given  by  the
    judge for his findings.  The judge misunderstood the  evidence  of  the
    appellant's second arrest at the end of paragraph  25.   There  was  no
    question of the Basij waiting before they came after her in  an  alley.
    They did not wait at all.

10.   At  paragraph  27  of  the  determination  the  judge  refers  to  the
    appellant's account  of  events  which  took  place  at  a  new  year's
    celebration bonfire.   He  found  that  it  was  neither  credible  nor
    plausible that if there were a large  number  of  Basij  attending  the
    bonfire they would not have been able to prevent the appellant and  her
    mother from escaping after the appellant  had  apparently  aggressively
    approached a Basij to stop him filming her.  The account given  by  the
    appellant was not implausible.  Mr Gayle also suggested that the  error
    referred to by the  judge  at  paragraph  28  was  an  error  that  the
    appellant had corrected at the outset of the hearing.

11.  Finally, at paragraph 30 of the determination, the judge found  against
    the appellant because she claimed that she had no idea that  the  agent
    was proposing to bring her to the United Kingdom.  The judge said  that
    this was not credible because agents remain in business  because  their
    reputation is that, circumstances permitting, they deliver  the  goods,
    including a destination of choice  if  that  is  practical.   Mr  Gayle
    simply pointed out that there was  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  the
    appellant did know where she was coming.

12.  Mr Kingham suggested that there were no material errors  and  that  the
    challenges amounted to little more than  disagreements.   He  suggested
    that if, as was claimed by the appellant, her previous  solicitors  had
    erred on her behalf then they should have been contacted and asked  for
    a witness statement or they should have been  made  the  subject  of  a
    complaint to the solicitors' regulatory authority.

13.  Any error that  the  judge  may  have  made  in  paragraph  29  in  his
    determination was not material because the medical evidence showed that
    the appellant had not been scalded at the time that she claimed to have
    been scalded.  The medical evidence suggested that it  was  simply  not
    credible that the appellant could have been scalded in  December  2012.
    He pointed out that the grounds of appeal suggested that  at  paragraph
    24 the judge had erred by applying the wrong standard of proof.  He had
    not.  It is apparent that the judge gave a proper self-direction on the
    standard of proof.   Simply  suggesting  that  the  appellant  had  not
    satisfied him that she had been encouraged to attend two demonstrations
    did not mean that he was not satisfied on any higher standard than on a
    reasonable likelihood.

14.  So far as paragraph 25 is  concerned  it  appears  that  the  appellant
    would have us believe that she actually deliberately provoked a  Basij.
    That was inconsistent with what the appellant had claimed.   The  judge
    was entitled to conclude as he had done.

15.  He disagreed that  there  was  a  material  misunderstanding  with  the
    evidence demonstrated by paragraph 25 of the determination and referred
    me to paragraph 21 of the appellant's  statement.   There  clearly  had
    been a pause because the Basij had clearly waited until  the  boyfriend
    went into the shop before they pursued the appellant.

16.  The judge was similarly entitled to find as he  did  at  paragraph  27.
    It was simply not plausible that on the one hand the appellant would be
    frightened of the authorities and on the other would knock a phone  out
    of the hand of the Basij.  The alleged error at  paragraph  28  and  30
    were not in any event material to the  outcome  of  the  appeal  and  a
    careful examination of the medical report reveals that the doctor  does
    not say that he has been given a chronology, there is  nothing  in  the
    report to indicate that he was aware of when it was  claimed  that  the
    scalding had occurred.

17.  He asked me to uphold the determination.

18.  Both representatives indicated that were I to find an error of  law  in
    the determination, they would have no objection  to  the  matter  being
    heard afresh by the First-tier Tribunal, given the length of  time  the
    appellant would have to wait before the matter could be reheard  by  me
    in North Shields.  I reserved my determination.

19.  I have concluded that the judge has materially  erred  in  law  in  his
    determination.  I believe that there is no basis  on  which  the  judge
    could make the finding at paragraph 29 of  his  determination,  that  a
    Basij would not try and injure the appellant with scalding water.   The
    judge gives no reasons at all why it is not credible that the appellant
    was scalding when clothed.  Similarly, I believe that at  paragraph  23
    of his  determination,  the  judge  errs  in  holding  it  against  the
    appellant  that  her  previous  solicitors  had  indicated   that   the
    appellant's first incident with the authorities  was  in  1389,  "exact
    month/day unknown".  That statement may indicate  that  the  solicitors
    themselves (as opposed to the appellant) do not know the day and  month
    that the appellant was first arrested.  The appellant had indicated  to
    the Tribunal that she was arrested on 25th Bahman, 1389 and claims that
    that was the date that she had given to her solicitors.  It may well be
    that her solicitors made an error.  This appears not  to  be  something
    which   was   contemplated   by   the   First-tier   Tribunal    judge.
    Unfortunately,  it  is  difficult  to  assess  how  much   this   first
    credibility finding influenced the judge in his  consideration  of  the
    remaining  evidence.   I  am  also  concerned  that  the  next  adverse
    credibility findings at paragraph 24 do not appear to  be  sufficiently
    reasoned.

20.  While I do not believe that the  judge  did  necessarily  misunderstand
    the appellant's evidence, which he records in paragraph 25,  I  believe
    that the judge was wrong to suggest that the Basij would not  react  as
    the appellant's evidence would have it.  He had no basis  on  which  to
    make that assumption.

21.  I believe that those errors mean that the determination  cannot  stand.



22.  Paragraph 7 of the Senior President's Practice  Statement  provides  as
    follows:-

         "7.1 Where under section 12(1) of  the  2007  Act  (proceedings  on
             appeal to the Upper Tribunal) the Upper  Tribunal  finds  that
             the making of the decision concerned involved the making of an
             error on a point of law, the Upper Tribunal may set aside  the
             decision and, if it does so, must either remit the case to the
             First-tier Tribunal under section 12(2)(b)(i) or  proceed  (in
             accordance with relevant Practice Directions) to  re-make  the
             decision under section 12(2)(b)(ii).

         7.2  The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to  proceed
             to re-make the decision, instead of remitting the case to  the
             First-tier Tribunal, unless the Upper  Tribunal  is  satisfied
             that:

             (a)  the effect of the error  has  been  to  deprive  a  party
                  before the First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or  other
                  opportunity for  that  party's  case  to  be  put  to  and
                  considered by the First-tier Tribunal; or

             (b)  the nature or extent of any judicial fact  finding  which
                  is necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be
                  re-made is such that,  having  regard  to  the  overriding
                  objective in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit  the  case
                  to the First-tier Tribunal.


         7.3  Remaking rather than remitting  will  nevertheless  constitute
             the normal approach to determining appeals where an  error  of
             law is found, even if some further fact finding is necessary."

23.  I am satisfied  that  this  is  a  case  which  falls  squarely  within
    paragraph 7 of the Senior President's  Practice  Statement,  given  the
    length of time that the parties will have to wait for the matter to  be
    relisted before me in North Shields.  Conversely,  it  could  be  heard
    relatively speedily by the First-tier  Tribunal  and  in  view  of  the
    overriding objective informing the onward conduct  of  this  appeal,  I
    have decided that this appeal be remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    for a hearing afresh before a  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  other  than
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Mark-Bell.  None of the  findings  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Mark-Bell are preserved.
