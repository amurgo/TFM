                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant, a national  of  India,  date  of  birth  26  June  1983,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision dated 11  December  2013  to
    refuse an application for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student
    Migrant and  to  make  removal  directions  under  Section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

2.   The basis of the refusal was that the Appellant had failed to show  the
    necessary attributes, being a Confirmation of Acceptance  for  Studies,
    and because of that the maintenance requirements were not met either.

3.   An appeal against that decision came before Judge T R  P  Hollingworth,
    who dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules and in respect  of
    Article 8 of the ECHR  and implicitly, although he made no reference to
    it, dismissed the appeal in respect of the removal directions.

4.   Permission to appeal that decision was refused by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Ford on 31 October 2014 but he did not deal with the fact it  was
    an out of time appeal.

5.   The matter was renewed before Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  McWilliam
    who, on 11 March 2015, granted permission to  appeal  and  as  extended
    time n the permission application.

6.   Notice of the permission was given to the Appellant on  14  April  2015
    and    served    at    his    last    notified     address     at     [
                     ].   No  communication  has  been  received  from  the
    Appellant and the Appellant had not appeared before First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Hollingworth in June 2014.

7.   The grounds are unsigned  but  evidently  settled  on  the  Appellant's
    behalf.

8.   No application was made for the hearing before me to be  postponed  and
    nor was it applied to be adjourned on the basis that the Appellant  was
    unable to attend for any reason at all.

9.   The Appellant applied on 12 March 2013 for leave to remain as a Tier  4
    (General)  Student  Migrant.    The  Appellant  had   relied   upon   a
    Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS)  assigned  by  Park  Royal
    College Limited.

10.  By the time the Secretary of State was assessing that  matter  and  the
    Tier 4 Sponsor register was checked on 11  December  2013,  Park  Royal
    College was no longer listed.

11.  The Appellant submitted an application  on  the  12  March  2013.   The
    Respondent had written to the Appellant on 22 June 2013 to  inform  the
    Appellant that a decision had been made to revoke the licence  of  Park
    Royal College Limited and no further consideration would  be  given  to
    the application for a period of 60 days from 22 June 2013.

12.  The purpose of the 60 day period was  to  allow  the  Appellant  as  an
    applicant to amend the application and submit a  different  sponsor  so
    that if the Appellant did not wish to remove from  the  United  Kingdom
    the Appellant could  obtain a new CAS for a course of study at a  fully
    licensed Tier 4 educational sponsor.

13.  On 25 July 2013 the Respondent by letter further  repeated  the  issues
    raised in the letter of 22 June 2013.

14.  In the permission application  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  the  Appellant
    accepted that he had received the letter dated 22 June  2013  from  the
    Home Office, on 24 June 2013 (paragraph 5).   The  Appellant  in  other
    grounds accepted receipt of the letter of 25 July 2013.   The documents
    may show that the Appellant obtained a new CAS letter on 20 August 2013
    but it does not appear that he submitted it on that date.  On 21 August
    2013 he says he sent the  relevant  documentation  to  the  wrong  UKBA
    address; copied from possibly an  email  of  19  September  2013.   The
    Appellant also acknowledged that he received a  letter  from  the  UKBA
    under reference 100200339784 in which the Respondent put the  Appellant
    on notice that she had not received  the  application.   There  was  no
    evidence in the papers provided that showed if the Appellant ever  sent
    an application to the UKBA at the correct address  with  the  necessary
    documentation.

15.  Calculating the 60 days from 22 June  2013  and  making  allowance  for
    that being a Saturday,  the delivery was not likely to occur  until  24
    June the documents would have been submitted to the correct part of the
    UK Border Agency by not later than 22/23 August 2013.

16.  There is no evidence that it  was  submitted  within  that  period.  It
    appears that the Appellant put the Respondent  on  notice  about  these
    matters by possibly an email of 9 September 2013.  A witness  statement
    from the Appellant which is unsigned  and  undated  asserted  that  the
    Appellant had been informed of the situation on 9 September 2013.

17.  The fact that the Appellant was called  in  to  provide  the  biometric
    information at an identified  post  office  on  7  September  2013  was
    neither here nor  there  for  the  biometric  process  was  not  simply
    triggered by the receipt of an application.  Thus the request to attend
    was no confirmation of any claim that the Appellant had  made  a  valid
    application at the time.

18.  If there is evidence to show the  Appellant  did  submit   the  correct
    part of the application to UKBA,  it  is  not  in  the  several  papers
    provided to me nor, it seems, was it in  the  papers  provided  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge.

19.  If 22 June 2013 was taken as the starting date  for  the  provision  of
    the new material in 60 days and CAS letter in particular, the  sixtieth
    day would have been 20 August 2013 as the earliest date.

20.  The Appellant proceeded on the basis that it was  not  until  a  letter
    from the Respondent of 25 July that time started to run whereas  it  is
    clear from the correspondence it ran from 22 June 2013.   It  therefore
    may be as a fact the  judge  got  it  wrong  in  identifying  that  the
    Appellant was out of time in  any  event  by  reference  to  the  dates
    referred to but it seemed  to  me  that  he  never,  on  the  evidence,
    submitted to the UKBA the substitute CAS.  In those  circumstances,  at
    the time the Respondent decided the matter, there was no CAS  in  being
    before the Secretary of State.

21.  Accordingly  the  appeal  failed.  The  grounds  do  not  disclose  any
    particular challenge to the judge's brief  conclusion  in  relation  to
    Article 8 and in the circumstances I find there is no material error of
    law disclosed by the grounds.


22.  No anonymity order was sought nor is one made.
