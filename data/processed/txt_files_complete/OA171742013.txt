                                                                    Claimant


Representation:
For the claimant: Mr M Bradshaw, instructed by Cartwright King Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Fahimeh Hakimi  Pirouj,  date  of  birth  28.5.85,  is  a
    citizen of Iran.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Moore  promulgated  9.7.14,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal on immigration grounds against the  decision  of  the
    respondent, dated 4.7.13, to refuse her application made on 16.4.13 for
    leave to enter the UK as a partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration
    Rules.  The Judge heard the appeal on 19.6.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Cruthers  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    3.9.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 21.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Moore should be set aside.

 6. In summary, the grounds complain that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    failed to take proper account  of  the  mandatory  documents  specified
    under Appendix FM-SE, which were not submitted  with  the  application;
    failed to properly take into account what the sponsor's actual earnings
    were at the date of the application and failed  to  take  into  account
    that if the income requirements are now met, the appellant could make a
    fresh application. See Hameed (Appendix FM  -  financial  year)  [2014]
    UKUT 00266 (IAC), promulgated on 11.6.14.

 7. In granting permission to appeal,  Judge  Cruthers  found  the  grounds
    arguable.

 8. The sponsor accepted that he did not meet the  �18,600  requirement  at
    the date of application, but contended that he did so at  the  date  of
    the appeal hearing. Having regard to the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, it is clear that the judge made the  error  of  extrapolating
    from the documentary evidence a finding that at the time of the  appeal
    hearing the claimant's gross annual income was in  excess  of  �18,600.
    The judge considered that there was unfairness in taking such a  strict
    and inflexible view of the sponsor's employment, which showed an income
    of some �14,246 at the time of the application.

 9. Mr Bradshaw contended that as the application was made on 16.4.13,  the
    decision should have been made with regard to the  Rules  in  force  at
    that date and not the date of decision of 4.7.13,  purportedly  relying
    on Kaur (entry clearance - date of application) [2013] UKUT 381  (IAC).
    I do not accept that case provides authority for the point made.  There
    the Upper Tribunal said, "It is established law that an application  is
    to be decided in accordance with the Rules in  force  at  the  date  of
    decision.  An  exception  to  that  is  where  there  are  transitional
    provisions." There were no transitional provisions for  Appendix  FM-SE
    and thus the correct date for consideration of the Rules was  the  date
    of decision.  The statement of changes of  14.3.13  provided  that  the
    modifications to FM-SE applied to all applications decided on or  after
    6.4.13. The statement of changes of 1.7.13 provided that  modifications
    to FM-SE took effect on 1.7.13 and made no provision  for  savings  for
    applications  made  prior  to  that  date.  In  the  circumstances,  Mr
    Bradshaw's submission is something of a red herring.

10. Further, he relied  on  a  difference  between  FM-SE  1(m)  &  (n)  as
    "currently in force" and that at the date  of  decision,  4.7.13  which
    provided that "cash income on which the correct tax has been  paid  may
    be counted as income under  this  Appendix,  subject  to  the  relevant
    evidential requirements of this Appendix." The current rule now  allows
    the net cash deposited to be counted as the gross sum for  the  purpose
    of income calculation, but at the date of  decision,  only  the  actual
    cash received and banked could be counted, provided the correct tax has
    been paid. Cash in hand payments with no taxation is not to be counted.
    However, the evidence still has to show the salary corresponding to the
    wage slips being paid into an  account  in  the  applicant's  name.  Mr
    Bradshaw seeks to take a technical point. The point, it  is  suggested,
    is that because of the way FM-SE 2 is worded the claimant does not have
    to show that the monies in the bank is the same as the wage slips. I do
    not see that this assists the claimant in any way. It is clear that  at
    the date of the application, he  did  not  meet  the  necessary  income
    threshold.

11. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal failed to comply with or  apply
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules. Regardless as to  which  set
    of Rules apply, it is clear that the relevant date for  the  production
    of evidence is the date of application and the financial  evidence  has
    to be provided for the period prior to and leading up to that date. The
    requirement is the same at the date of application as  it  was  at  the
    date of decision. The income has to be evidenced by wage slips covering
    a 6 month period prior to the date of application and  bank  statements
    show that the salary has been paid into an account in  the  applicant's
    name, etc. Thus  the  �18,600  threshold  has  to  be  demonstrated  by
    acceptable evidence under Appendix FM-SE for the period  prior  to  the
    application in April 2013.

12. There is no discretion in the First-tier Tribunal Judge to waive  these
    requirements. Case authority has held  that  there  is  nothing  unfair
    about the Secretary of State's application of the Immigration Rules, as
    for example, is the effect of Hameed (Appendix FM  -  financial  year),
    where the Upper Tribunal also held that the remedy  for  the  appellant
    was to make a fresh application if and when  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules can be met and that  there  was  nothing  disproportionate  about
    that.  Further  in  R(MM  (Lebanon))  v  SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ   985,
    promulgated 11.7.14 after the promulgation of  Judge  Moore's  decision
    and thus could not be taken into consideration,  the  Court  of  Appeal
    upheld,  inter  alia,  the  proportionality  of  the  income  threshold
    requirement of Appendix FM.

13. In the circumstances, I set the decision aside and proceeded to  rehear
    the appeal.

14. I heard  oral  evidence  from  the  sponsor,  relying  on  his  witness
    statement of 22.8.13. When asked why his  wife  simply  didn't  make  a
    fresh application with the correct evidence, he  said  he  thought  the
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal would be  shorter  in  time.  He  had  not
    spoken to her about making a new  application.  However,  he  confirmed
    that if he had to, he would. He apparently was  still  not  paying  his
    salary into the bank account and thus may have some difficulty  meeting
    the requirements of Appendix FM.

15. I find it very clear that the claimant does not meet  the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules under Appendix FM, and 2(c) of FM-SE. The bank
    statements do not show the salary paid into the account and the sponsor
    did not meet the financial threshold at the relevant time.

16. I have referred above to Hameed, and MM  (Lebanon).  There  is  nothing
    disproportionate about requiring the claimant to meet  the  Immigration
    Rules and the financial requirements. Given that the sponsor now claims
    to be able to meet the financial threshold,  he  should  make  a  fresh
    application.  Requiring  him  to  do   so   cannot   be   regarded   as
    disproportionate. Given that he can do so and said he  will  do  so,  I
    fail to see how, applying  the  Razgar  steps  to  the  proportionality
    balancing exercise between on the one hand the rights of  the  claimant
    to have family life with the sponsor and on the  other  the  legitimate
    and necessary aim of the state to protect the  economic  well-being  of
    the UK through immigration controls, the decision can  be  regarded  as
    disproportionate or otherwise unduly harsh.

17. In reaching that conclusion I take into account all that has been urged
    upon me about the claimant and the sponsor. However, I am  required  to
    take account of section 117B(3) that It is in the public interest,  and
    in particular in the interests of the economic well-being of the United
    Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
    are financially independent, because such persons-(a) are not a  burden
    on taxpayers, and (b) are better able to integrate into society. I take
    the point that the sponsor  claims  that  he  can  meet  the  financial
    threshold, but in fact has not yet demonstrated that  he  can  evidence
    that fact.

18. I further take into account that the sponsor is not a British  citizen,
    though he has ILR here. There is no reason why he  cannot  relocate  to
    live with the claimant in India in order to pursue family  life.  There
    is no legitimate entitlement to be able to settle  in  the  UK  and  no
    reason why he should be able to  do  so  under  article  8  ECHR  as  a
    shortcut to compliance  with  the  Rules  when  they  cannot  meet  the
    requirements of those Rules.

19. In the circumstances the appeal must fail.

Conclusions:

20. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
