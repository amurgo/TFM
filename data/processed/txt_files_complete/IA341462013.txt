For the Appellant:           Mr J Chhotu, instructed by Ved & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:          Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The Appellant is a citizen of  India  born  on  15th  April  1988.  He
      appeals against the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  dated
      28th January 2014 dismissing  his  appeal,  against  the  Respondent's
      decision of 31st October 2012 refusing further leave to  remain  as  a
      Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant, for want of jurisdiction.

2.    The Appellant was granted a visa valid from 21st August 2008  to  21st
      January 2012. In December  2011,  he  applied  for  further  leave  to
      remain, but his application was rejected for non-payment  of  fee.  He
      made a second application on  9th  January  2012  enclosing  a  postal
      order. This application was acknowledged by  the  Respondent  on  11th
      January 2012 and refused in March 2012. The  Appellant  made  a  third
      application on 26th June 2012 which was refused on 31st  October  2012
      (because the bank statements were dated more than one month before the
      application) without a right of appeal.

3.    The Appellant appealed and on 18th July 2013, the First-tier  Tribunal
      made a decision on a preliminary issue and found  that  the  Appellant
      did not have a right of appeal. The Appellant requested  a  review  of
      this decision, but the First-tier Tribunal refused to  reconsider  the
      decision that there was no jurisdiction to hear the  appeal.  On  16th
      August 2013, the Appellant again appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal
      and a Basnet direction was given; the validity of the appeal was to be
      determined at a hearing. On 28th January 2014, the First Tier Tribunal
      determined the appeal on the papers and dismissed the appeal for  want
      of jurisdiction. It is against this decision that  the  Appellant  now
      appeals.

4.    Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Rintoul  on
      27th May 2014 on the grounds that it was arguable that there had  been
      a procedural error whereby material was not submitted  to  the  First-
      tier Tribunal due to the improper action of the part of an employee of
      the Appellant's former representatives.

5.    At  the  hearing  before  me,  Mr  Duffy  confirmed  that  the  second
      application made on 9th January 2012 was rejected as invalid for  non-
      payment of  fee.  He  conceded  that  following  Basnet  (validity  of
      application - respondent) [2012] UKUT 00113(IAC), the  Respondent  had
      failed to show  that  the  application  was  not  accompanied  by  the
      specified fee and the Appellant  did  not  have  a  right  of  appeal.
      Therefore, the decision of 31st October 2012  was  not  in  accordance
      with the law. He invited me  to  allow  the  appeal  to  that  limited
      extent.

6.    At paragraph 27 of the determination the Judge stated "I do  not  find
      that the Respondent has asserted that the application made in  January
      2012 was returned as invalid as no fee was paid, as  no  evidence  has
      been provided to the Tribunal that, that was the case." Mr  Duffy  has
      now confirmed the position.

7.    I find that that Respondent has failed to  prove  its  assertion  that
      the application was invalid for non-payment of fee  following  Basnet.
      Therefore, the Appellant made an in-time application and  consequently
      he has a right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.  I  find  that  a
      procedural error occurred whereby the Judge's decision to dismiss  the
      appeal for lack of jurisdiction amounted to an error of law.



8.    I set aside the determination dated 28th January 2014 and  remake  the
      decision as follows: The Appellant's appeal is allowed in  so  far  as
      the decision of 31st October 2012 was not in accordance with the law.
