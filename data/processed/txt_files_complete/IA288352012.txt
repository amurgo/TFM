                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision  of  Judge  Kimnell
    made following  a hearing at Hatton Cross on 14 February 2013.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 24th December 1971.   She
    claims to have entered the UK on 4th March 1998 with a visit visa.   On
    23rd May 2012 she applied for indefinite leave to remain on  the  basis
    of her length of residence in the UK.

 3. The Secretary of State refused  the  application  because  he  was  not
    satisfied that she had been resident for the period claimed. There  was
    no evidence of lawful entry and it was assumed that she was an  illegal
    entrant.  The Appellant provided one payslip for February  1999  and  a
    Woolwich Bank statement for February 2000 and a  British  Telecom  bill
    dated February 2002 and then provided substantial evidence from 2005 to
    2012.  The Secretary  of  State  considered  that  she  had  only  been
    resident in the UK from 2005  and  not  since  1998  as  claimed.   She
    refused the application on the grounds that the Appellant had failed to
    meet the requirements of paragraph 276D  with  reference  to  paragraph
    276B(i)(b) of HC 395 as amended.

 4. The Secretary of State then considered the Appellant's claim in respect
    of Article 8 of the ECHR and stated that the Appellant did not meet the
    requirements of the new Immigration Rules, amended on 9th July 2012.

 5. The Judge agreed with the Respondent and said that  the  Appellant  had
    not proved to the standard of a balance of probabilities that  she  had
    been present in the UK for a continuous period of fourteen  years.   He
    considered the Appellant's claim to resist removal on the grounds  that
    she had established a private life in the UK but concluded that removal
    would be proportionate.

The Grounds of Application

 6. The Appellant sought permission to appeal, in essence, on  the  grounds
    that the Judge had not  properly  considered  all  of  the  documentary
    evidence, in particular the documents from 1999 and 2000; his reasoning
    was not within the spirit of the old fourteen year rule.   He  had  not
    properly considered the witness evidence  and  should  have  considered
    Paragraphs 276DG and 395C.

 7. Permission to appeal was refused by Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Martin  who
    stated that the Judge had given detailed reasons for  disbelieving  the
    Appellant's claim to have been in the UK for fourteen years.  She  said
    that Paragraph 276DG  was  irrelevant  to  the  appeal   since  it  was
    introduced after the application  was  made,  and  Paragraph  395C  was
    deleted in February 2012 before the Appellant made her application.

 8. The Appellant then renewed the application on new  grounds.   Ground  1
    states that the Judge accepted that  the  old  rules  applied  but  the
    decision was made under the new rules. The appeal therefore should have
    been allowed as not in accordance with the law.

 9. Secondly, the Judge accepted the  Respondent's  classification  of  the
    Appellant as an illegal entrant but that arose  solely  because  of  an
    absence of records to show that she had arrived in the UK  on  a  visit
    visa on 4th March 1998.  The UKBA website states that the  onus  is  on
    the Respondent to demonstrate that the applicant is a  illegal  entrant
    to a higher standard of probabilities, but the Respondent has failed to
    provide any evidence that the UK immigration services retain records as
    far back as 1998 which would be a basic prerequisite to a decision that
    the applicant was an illegal entrant.

10. Finally, the Judge's treatment of the  witness  evidence  was  unlawful
    because the applicant had not been required to demonstrate a  break  in
    continuous residence and this was not therefore part of the  case  that
    she had to answer. The Judge failed  to  make  clear  findings  on  the
    witness evidence which was that they had known the applicant throughout
    the period, from 1998 to date.

11. Permission to appeal was then granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Perkins
    on 21st  May 2013 on all grounds.

12. On 5th June 2013 the Respondent served  a  reply  opposing  the  appeal
    arguing that the Appellant was obliged to prove that she  entered  with
    leave as claimed and had to demonstrate  that she met the  requirements
    of the Rule including continuous residence. The reliance  on  the  UKBA
    website was a clear mistake since the reference to the burden as  being
    to a higher probability is incorrect.

Submissions

13. Mr Adojutelegan said that he was relying on the second set of  grounds.
    He submitted that the Judge had made a finding that the  appeal  should
    be considered under the old Rules  because  the  application  was  made
    before  July  2012  and  consequently  the  original  decision  by  the
    Respondent was unlawful. Secondly, according to the UKBA  website,  the
    burden to demonstrate unlawful entry lies with the Secretary of  State.
    Finally, whilst the burden was on  the  Appellant  to  show  continuous
    residence that was not the same as establishing that she had  not  been
    out of the country.  He asked  that  the  decision  be  remade  in  the
    Appellant's favour.

14. Mr Tufan accepted that the decision should have been made under the old
    Rules, because the application was made before July  2012.  but  stated
    that any error in the refusal letter was immaterial because it had been
    corrected by the Judge. The Secretary of State  had  produced  all  the
    information that she could with respect to the Appellant's  entry,  and
    even if the burden was on her it had been discharged.  So far as ground
    3 was concerned, it amounted to a mere disagreement with the  decision.
    The obligation lay with the Appellant to show that she had been in  the
    UK for a continuous period of fourteen years and there was a period  of
    three years from 2002 to 2005 when there was no  documentary  proof  of
    her being here.

Findings and Conclusions

15. The reasons for refusal letter states that:

         "As it is concluded that you have been resident in the UK for  only
         seven years and you have failed to  provide  satisfactory  evidence
         that you have had at least fourteen years' continuous residence  in
         the UK you have failed to meet the requirement  of  paragraph  286D
         with reference to paragraph 276B(i)(b)of HC 395 as amended."

16. It is agreed by all parties that the Rules governing  this  appeal  are
    those which were in place at the date of application.  The  passage  in
    the refusal letter quoted above correctly refers to the Rules  as  they
    were before amendment in July 2012.

17. The Respondent then considered the Article  8  aspects  of  the  appeal
    under the Rules as they were at the date of her  decision,  namely  the
    Rules as amended on 9th July 2012, and she should  not  have  done  so.
    However the Tribunal corrected the error. The Judge did not address the
    argument that the Respondent had acted unlawfully  in  considering  the
    Rules as they were at the date of decision, since that argument was not
    made to him. However, he stated that the fact that the Appellant is not
    able to meet the requirements of the new Rules with respect to  Article
    8 is not the end of the matter, and did in fact decide  the  appeal  on
    what he described as classic Article 8 principles, as he  was  required
    to do.

18. With respect to ground 2, it seems that the Respondent has  not  helped
    herself by placing on a website, which may  be  historic,  a  statement
    that "the Secretary of State has to show illegal entry (proof on a high
    balance of probabilities)". There is no such  thing.  The  standard  of
    proof is the balance of probabilities. However  whether  the  Appellant
    was an illegal entrant or not is immaterial to the decision.  What  the
    Appellant has to show is continuous residence  regardless  of  how  she
    entered.

19. The Judge had before him some evidence that the Appellant  was  working
    in February 1999, although  the  payslip  only  shows  a  name  and  no
    address, and states that she had earned ï¿½5,940  to  date.     Taken  by
    itself it is capable of showing that the Appellant was  working  as  at
    that date but it is not possible from that  single  payslip  to  deduce
    that she had entered the UK as she claimed in March 1998,  still  less,
    in the absence of any documentary evidence at all for a period of  over
    3 years, that the Appellant had been continuously resident  since  that
    date.

20. Finally, it was open to the Judge to reject the oral evidence from  the
    witness for the reasons which he gave in paragraph 39.  The burden lies
    with the Appellant to establish the case which she is seeking to  make.
    The Judge was neither satisfied  that  the  witness  had  not  met  the
    Appellant as claimed by chance in 1998 nor that he was in a position to
    give evidence that he had known her during the period when  documentary
    evidence was unavailable.

The Decision

21. The judge's decision will stand.  The Appellant's appeal is dismissed.
