                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr Blackwood of One Immigration (Leicester)
For the Respondent: Mr Smart - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Colyer, promulgated on the 20th November  2012,  following  a
        hearing at Nottingham Magistrate Court on the 5th November 2012, in
        which he dismissed the appellant's appeal against  the  refusal  of
        the respondent to revoke a deportation order made against him as  a
        result of a commission of a crime of violence.


     2. On 11th January 2012 the Secretary  of  State  made  a  deportation
        decision/order in accordance with the provisions  to  be  found  in
        Regulation 24(3) Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
        2006.


     3. Mr Omar was removed on 16th March 2012.


     4. On 19th March 2012 One Immigration wrote to  the  respondent  which
        was treated as an application for  revocation  of  the  deportation
        order.


     5. Permission to appeal was sought on a number of grounds one of which
        is that the Judge heard arguments on a preliminary issue  as  noted
        in paragraphs 10 - 19 of the determination.  The  First-tier  Judge
        found he could not consider a challenge to the  lawfulness  of  the
        original deportation order. It is said this failed to  address  the
        Immigration (Notices) Regulations 2003 which mandates that a notice
        must be accompanied by a statement of  reasons.  The  relevance  of
        this issue is said to be that the time in which a person can appeal
        a decision does not begin to run if such a notice is defective.  As
        such the comment by the Judge that  the  appellant  became  'appeal
        rights exhausted on or about 19th July 2012' is perverse.


     6. This is an important issue which the Tribunal  indicated  it  would
        consider first for if it was to find in favour of Mr Omar it may be
        that there had been no valid service of the notice in  relation  to
        the original deportation decision. As such the  time  in  which  Mr
        Omar had to appeal against the decision has not yet began  to  run.
        As such, although the deportation order was signed, it  should  not
        have been enforced if there was an outstanding right of appeal.  If
        this is the case the removal of Mr Omar  may  have  been  unlawful,
        although claims for mandatory or  quashing  orders  or  claims  for
        damages are not for this  Tribunal  as  it  does  not  possess  the
        necessary jurisdiction at this time.


     7. An initial hearing took place before me on the 23rd May 2013. As  a
        result of a letter containing additional submissions being filed by
        One Immigration on 7th June 2013 and a response being received from
        the Secretary of State, all without leave, the  case  was  relisted
        without attendance on 26th June 2013 to allow the submission to  be
        admitted.



Background


     8. Mr Omar was born on the 7th  October  1981  and  is  a  citizen  of
        Sweden.  The  Tribunal  has  been  provided  with  a  very  helpful
        chronology of events by Kim Abbott, a caseworker  employed  by  the
        Home  Office  within  the   Criminal   Casework   team,   who   had
        responsibility for Mr Omar's case in the following terms:






   |                 |It is not known when Mr Omar arrived in the United        |
|                 |Kingdom. As an EEA national, he would have had the right  |
|                 |to free movement as of 1 January 1995.                    |
|6 December 2002  |Mr Omar first came to the adverse attention of the        |
|                 |authorities.                                              |
|26 November 2004 |Mr Omar came to the adverse attention of the authorities  |
|                 |again.                                                    |
|11 July 2005     |Mr Omar came to the adverse attention of the authorities  |
|                 |again.                                                    |
|18 January 2007  |Mr Omar came to the adverse attention of the authorities  |
|                 |again.                                                    |
|1 August 2008    |Mr Omar came to the adverse attention of the authorities  |
|                 |again.                                                    |
|20 May 2010      |Mr Omar came to the adverse attention of the authorities  |
|                 |again.                                                    |
|28 September 2010|Mr Omar came to the adverse attention of the authorities  |
|                 |again, when he was convicted at Leicester Magistrates     |
|                 |Court of destroying or damaging property (value of damage |
|                 |ï¿½5000 or less), for which he received a community order on|
|                 |27 September 2011. However, the order was revoked on 3    |
|                 |June 2011 (community order) at Leicester Crown Court (due |
|                 |to a period of imprisonment given at a later date).       |
|30 April 2010    |Mr Omar came to the adverse attention of the authorities  |
|                 |in relation to his most recent offence when he robbed his |
|                 |victim of his phone and smoking materials.                |
|22 March 2011    |Mr Omar was convicted at Leicester Crown Court of robbery,|
|                 |failing to surrender to custody at an appointed time and  |
|                 |with conviction of an offence whilst a community order was|
|                 |in force.                                                 |
|3 June 2011      |Mr Omar was sentenced to a total of 15 months imprisonment|
|                 |for the most recent offence. He did not appeal against    |
|                 |conviction or sentence.                                   |
|30 June 2011     |Mr Omar was advised of his liability to deportation when  |
|                 |UK Borders Agency sent him an ICD.0350-EEA.               |
|27 July 2011     |Mr Omar was served with the ICD.0350-EEA, but failed to   |
|                 |respond.                                                  |
|15 December 2011 |The UK Borders Agency were advised that Mr Omar was seen  |
|                 |during a surgery at HPM Ranby 8 December 2011, and had    |
|                 |advised staff there that he had been asked to provide     |
|                 |information and that he would do so as soon as possible.  |
|                 |However, Mr Omar failed to respond.                       |
|16 December 2011 |Mr Omar was served with the UK Border Agency's letter     |
|                 |dated 16 December 2011, requesting this information within|
|                 |10 working days (as previously requests for information   |
|                 |had failed to prompt a response). However, Mr Omar failed |
|                 |to respond.                                               |
|9 January 2012   |Mr Omar was made the subject of a notice of decision to   |
|                 |make a deportation order (dated 9 January 2012).          |
|                 |Authorisation was also obtained to detain him under       |
|                 |immigration powers at the end of his custodial sentence   |
|                 |(on 17 January 2012).                                     |
|                 |                                                          |
|                 |Consequently, on 9 January 2012, I prepared the following |
|                 |papers for Mr Omar:                                       |
|                 |                                                          |
|                 |Notice of decision to make a deportation order (ICD.1070) |
|                 |(dated 9 January 2012)                                    |
|                 |Appeals paperwork (ICD.1041)                              |
|                 |Disclaimer (ICD.3066)                                     |
|                 |Authority to detain (ICD.02570, dated 9 January 2012)     |
|                 |Reasons for detention letter (ICD.1913, dated 9 January   |
|                 |2012)                                                     |
|                 |                                                          |
|                 |NOTE: at the time of drafting the notice of decision to   |
|                 |deport (ICD.1070) dated 9 January 2012, a full reasons for|
|                 |deportation letter (ICD.1914) could not be provided as I  |
|                 |was still awaiting information from Mr Omar regarding his |
|                 |length of residence etc. Additionally, I was also awaiting|
|                 |information from the Probation Service. I also considered |
|                 |it necessary to obtain that information before issuing    |
|                 |full reasons for deportation. However, on the basis of his|
|                 |conviction dated 22 March 2011, at Leicester Crown Court  |
|                 |for robbery, failing to surrender to custody at an        |
|                 |appointed time and with conviction of an offence whilst a |
|                 |community order was in force, for which he was sentenced  |
|                 |to 15 month imprisonment, he met the criteria for         |
|                 |deportation of EEA nationals. Furthermore, the notice of a|
|                 |decision to deport (ICD.1070) dated 9 January 2012),      |
|                 |clearly outlined our initial reasons for deportation.     |
|11 January 2012  |I e-mailed HMP Ranby to the effect that I was about to fax|
|                 |over the deportation and detention paperwork for Mr Omar  |
|                 |(at 13:34).                                               |
|                 |                                                          |
|                 |I faxed the above detailed documents to HMP Ranby.  Those |
|                 |documents, including the fax cover sheet, amounting to 36 |
|                 |pages, which I faxed to fax number 01777 863020. I        |
|                 |received a fax confirmation which timed the sending as    |
|                 |13:34 hours. I produce a copy of those documents into     |
|                 |evidence (Reference KA 1).                                |
|                 |                                                          |
|                 |At 14:05, HMP Ranby e-mailed me back (copy produced       |
|                 |Reference KA 2) and confirmed that they had received all  |
|                 |the paperwork (all dated 9 January 2012), which was served|
|                 |the same day. (as I later confirmed when I rang the prison|
|                 |on 9 February 2012 and updated the Home Office database to|
|                 |this effect.                                              |
|                 |                                                          |
|                 |5 days were provided for Mr Omar to appeal from the date  |
|                 |of service.                                               |
|                 |                                                          |
|                 |(One Immigration's letter to Keith Vaz MP dated 17 April  |
|                 |2012, also referred to my letter dated 9 January 2012,    |
|                 |which was later forwarded to the Home Office for a        |
|                 |response).                                                |
|17 January 2012  |I prepared a draft reasons for deportation letter         |
|                 |(ICD.1914) for my  Senior caseworker for checking and in  |
|                 |my accompanying minute to the Senior Case Worker, I stated|
|                 |that Mr Abdallah Mohammed Omar had indicated that he      |
|                 |intended appealing against deportation (I am unsure where |
|                 |I obtained this information, but I was in direct telephone|
|                 |contact with the prison at that time and it is not unusual|
|                 |to telephone to confirm information/facts).               |
|                 |                                                          |
|                 |My letter outlined the full reasons for Mr Omar's         |
|                 |deportation, on the basis of all the previous information |
|                 |that we had. In that letter, it referred to the previous  |
|                 |letters issue to Mr Omar, requesting information and his  |
|                 |lack of a response, and at the end of that letter, in the |
|                 |"Human Rights and Proportionality" part of that letter, it|
|                 |was repeated to the effect that as Mr Omar had not        |
|                 |responded to requests for information on 30 June 2011 and |
|                 |again in 16 December 2011, that we had no further         |
|                 |information to consider. Mr Omar's attention was again    |
|                 |drawn to the fact that he was advised of his appeal rights|
|                 |in the notice of a decision to make a deportation order   |
|                 |dated 9 January 2012.                                     |
|                 |                                                          |
|                 |NOTE: MONTHLY DETENTION REVIEWS AFTER THIS DATE ALSO      |
|                 |REPEATED THE DATE OF SERVICE OF THE NOTICE OF A DECISION  |
|                 |TO MAKE A DEPORTATION ORDER AND THE FACT THAT NO APPEAL   |
|                 |HAD BEEN LODGED.                                          |
|                 |                                                          |
|19 January 2012  |I noted the Home Office database to the effect that I had |
|                 |amended the reason for deportation letter (ICD.19140) and |
|                 |had faxed it to the prison and was just awaiting for the  |
|                 |legal appeal to be lodged.                                |
|9 February 2012  |I received confirmation that Mr Omar had been moved from  |
|                 |HMP Ranby to HMP Lincoln on 3 February 2012 (I noted the  |
|                 |Home Office database to this effect). I also confirmed    |
|                 |verbally that the deportation and detention paperwork had |
|                 |been served on 11 January 2012. I also noted on the same  |
|                 |date that Mr Abdallah Mohammed Omar had apparently refused|
|                 |to comply with the documentation process by providing     |
|                 |bio-data, but that I had sufficient information to enable |
|                 |me to obtain an EU letter for removal purposes.  I further|
|                 |stated that Mr Abdallah Mohammed Omar had not appealed    |
|                 |against deportation, as claimed.  As such, I proceeded to |
|                 |take steps to obtain the signed Deportation Order as he   |
|                 |had effectively become "appeal rights exhausted" on 18    |
|                 |January 2012.                                             |
|13 February 2012 |Mr Omar, was inducted at HMP Morton Hall.                 |
|16 February 2012 |As no evidence had been received to the effect that Mr    |
|                 |Omar had appealed against deportation, a signed           |
|                 |Deportation Order was obtained.  This was also faxed to   |
|                 |the prison on 16 February 2012.                           |
|26 February 2012 |Mr Omar was served with the signed Deportation Order.     |
|5 March 2012     |Removal directions were set for this date but subsequently|
|                 |cancelled.                                                |
|                 |                                                          |
|                 |The monthly detention review on this date included        |
|                 |reference to the appellant having been served a letter    |
|                 |outlining the reasons for deportation since the last      |
|                 |review. I accept that this is a typing error, and was     |
|                 |probably copied from a previous review. The document is on|
|                 |our system as a template, the last sentence is part of the|
|                 |standard wording of the template, and would be included   |
|                 |whether the appellant was represented or not.             |
|9 March 2012     |Removal directions were set for this date, but were       |
|                 |subsequently cancelled as Mr Omar refused to leave the    |
|                 |Immigration Removal Centre.                               |
|12 March 2012    |Removal directions were re-set for 16 March 2012.         |
|16 March 2012    |Mr Omar was deported.                                     |
|                 |                                                          |
|                 |A faxed letter was received from One Immigration, after Mr|
|                 |Omar had been deported. The letter referred to a fax dated|
|                 |14th March 2012, sent to a fax number unknown to me and   |
|                 |this letter has never been received to date.  The letter  |
|                 |dated 16 March 2012 was taken as an application to revoke |
|                 |a Deportation Order.                                      |
|19 March 2012    |I received a letter from One Immigration, after that they |
|                 |wanted their letter dated 16 March 2012 to be treated as  |
|                 |an application for revocation of a Deportation Order. They|
|                 |also referred to their fax dated 14 March 2012, which I   |
|                 |had no knowledge of.  They stated that there was no       |
|                 |consideration of Mr Abdallah Mohammed Omar's relationships|
|                 |in the UK, but I noted on the Home Office database that Mr|
|                 |Abdallah Mohammed Omar did not appeal against deportation |
|                 |and never responded to being advised of his liability for |
|                 |deportation, or the request for further information.      |
|                 |Therefore, there was no information to consider in        |
|                 |relation to family ties etc. However, I faxed a letter to |
|                 |One Immigration requesting written authority from Mr Omar |
|                 |confirming that they are acting on his behalf, following  |
|                 |which I stated that I would respond to their letter.      |
|19 March 2012    |A faxed letter was received from One Immigration enclosing|
|                 |their client's authority. This was taken as an application|
|                 |to revoke the deportation order.                          |
|19 April 2012    |I put a proposal to the Senior Caseworker in Team 7,      |
|                 |Criminal Casework, refusing [to revoke] the Deportation   |
|                 |Oder.                                                     |
|11 May 2012      |I faxed the reasons for refusing [to revoke] the          |
|                 |Deportation Order to One immigration.                     |
|8 June 2012      |The appeal against the decision to refuse to revoke the   |
|                 |deportation order was received and is on-going.           |
|                 |                                                          |








Mr Omar's case



     9. In his skeleton argument filed on behalf of Mr  Omar  Mr  Blackwood
        records in paragraphs 1 to 4 the following:


              1.  A is a Swedish national who resided in the UK continuously
   from                26.01.2002 to 16.03.2012 (i.e. for  over  10  years).
   By letter dated                       09.01.2012  R  notified  A  of  her
   decision to make a DO against A. A                 did not appeal at that
   time,     apparently      due      to      a      lack      of      legal
   representation. A was  deported  from  the  UK  on  16.03.12  further  to
     the DO made by R on the 16.02.12.


              2.  A had contacted his criminal solicitors with regard to his
                           immigration matters when first contacted by R. It
   was not until                    January 2012 that he was  informed  that
   they were  unable  to  assist                 him  with  his  immigration
   matters. A then contacted legal  aid                     representatives;
   the booked appointment was then cancelled as A                  was moved
   out   of   the   area    in    which    those    representatives    could
   accept instructions.


              3.  A instructed his current representatives (OI) very late in
   the                     proceedings - on 14.03.2012. OI faxed R the  same
   day and attempted                to contact R by telephone, to no  avail.
   OI faxed R again on 16.03.2012.               R treated the OI faxes as a
   request for revocation of the DO.


    10. The grounds of appeal submitted in challenge to the refusal  raised
        a number of issues. Paragraph 12 of those grounds states:




              12. Notwithstanding the matters raised in the first fax, R has
   provided                no evidence that A was served with the Notice  of
   decision dated                   09.01.2012 and no evidence  that  A  was
   served with the notice of his                 appeal rights.


    11. In paragraph 28 of his skeleton argument Mr Blackwood sets out  his
        submissions in relation to the issue of the  source  of  Mr  Omar's
        right to appeal against the deportation decision and  submits  that
        the time  in  which  the  appellant  had  to  appeal  the  original
        deportation decision has yet to start to run [40 - 41]. He  submits
        the Notice Regulations are relevant to EEA  decisions  and  that  a
        failure to serve in accordance with the  Notice  Regulations  meant
        there had not been valid service of the notice and so time did  not
        start to run.



The Secretary of State's case


    12. On behalf of the Secretary of State Mr Smart's  contends  that  the
        service of the notice was lawful, that the Upper  Tribunal  has  no
        jurisdiction to re-open this issue, and that the decision of  Judge
        Colyer is not infected by any material error of law.



Discussion



    13.  Mr  Smart  challenged  the  Tribunals  ability  to  consider   the
        lawfulness of the deportation  decision.  The  Upper  Tribunal  has
        jurisdiction in relation to appeals on points of law  arising  from
        decisions made by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  other  then  excluded
        decisions. In addition there may be a situation in which  there  is
        no provision in statute or common law and so no jurisdiction.  This
        latter may arise in a case when  judicial  review  is  the  correct
        vehicle by which to seek a remedy. In relation to the Tribunal,  an
        excluded decision includes a bail decision,  ancillary  proceedings
        and a decision on  a  preliminary  issue.   The  grounds  on  which
        permissions to appeal is  sought  refer  to  the  question  of  the
        lawfulness of the deportation as being a preliminary issue  as  did
        Judge Colyer. I do not find this to have been a  preliminary  issue
        in the strict sense in which  this  term  is  understood  in  legal
        circles, such as to make it an  excluded  decision,  but  rather  a
        point considered as a preliminary point in the sense it was  to  be
        considered first as it may have been determinative of the remainder
        of the issues. I do  not  find  the  Tribunal  jurisdiction  to  be
        excluded on this basis.


    14. The advocates both refer to The  Immigration  (Notice)  Regulations
        2003 (as amended).  The Immigration (Notices) Regulations 2003 only
        apply to a decision under the Immigration Act  1971,  which  is  an
        immigration decision within  the  meaning  of  section  82  of  the
        Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. It is contended  that
        the intention to deport Mr Omar is an immigration  decision  within
        the meaning of section 82 which was not challenged by Mr Smart.


    15. Regulation 4 (1) provides that  ,  subject  to  Regulation  6,  the
        decision  maker  must  give  written  notice  to  a  person  of  an
        immigration decision or EEA decision taken in respect of him  which
        is appealable. Regulation 6 is not applicable to this appeal.


    16. Regulation 5 deals with the  content  of  the  notice  given  under
        Regulation 4(1) and states:


              5 (1) (a)    it is to include or be accompanied by a statement
   of the  reasons                         for  the  decision  to  which  it
   relates.


              5 (3)         ..the  notice  under  regulation  4  shall  also
   include or be                         accompanied by, a  statement  which
   advised the person of:


                  (a)  His right of appeal




    17. The regulations do not proscribe the format of the  notice  or  how
        the information should be provided, just that it must be.


    18. The 2006 Regulations incorporate into United Kingdom  domestic  law
        the provisions of Directive 2004/38/EC dated 29th April 2004  which
        sets out the rights of citizens  of  the  Union  and  their  family
        members to move and reside freely within the  territory  of  Member
        States. Article 30 of the Directive states:


              Article 30


              1.  The persons concerned shall be notified in writing of  any
   decisions taken                  under Article 27(1), in such a way  that
   they  are  able  to  comprehend   its                 content   and   the
   implications of them.


              2.  The persons concerned shall be informed precisely  and  in
   full, of the public                   policy, public security  or  public
   heath grounds on which the decisions               taken in their case is
   based,  unless   this   is   contrary   to   the   internets   of   State
   security.


    19. This appears on the face of it to mirror the Notice Regulations but
        is also a matter considered in the recent case of ZZ v Secretary of
        State for the Home Department [2013] EUECJ C-300/11 (04 June 2013),
        to which the parties additional submissions related, in  which  the
        Grand Chamber gave their ruling in response  to  a  request  for  a
        preliminary ruling concerning the interpretation of Article 30 (2).
        The case involved ZZ who the respondent sought to exclude from  the
        United Kingdom on grounds of public security. In that case  it  was
        accepted that the Secretary of State  did  not  inform  ZZ  of  the
        precise and in full grounds that  constituted  the  basis  for  the
        decision which was a decision appealed to SIAC.


    20. The Court found:


              46      Article 30(1) of Directive 2004/38 provides, so far as
   concerns  the  requisite                 content  of,  and  statement  of
   reasons for, a decision taken under Article 27                   of  that
   directive, such as the decision refusing  entry  at  issue  in  the  main
     proceedings, that the person concerned must be notified of the decision
   in                  writing and  in  such  a  way  that  he  is  able  to
   comprehend its content and the                implications  for  him.  In
   addition, Article 30(2) provides that the person                concerned
   must  be  informed,  precisely  and  in  full,  of  the  public   policy,
   public security or public health grounds which constitute  the  basis  of
   such                a decision, unless this is contrary to the  interests
   of State security.


              47      Article 31 of Directive 2004/38  obliges  the  Member
   States  to  lay  down,  in                 domestic  law,  the   measures
   necessary to enable Union citizens  and                       members  of
   their families  to  have  access  to  judicial  and,  where  appropriate,
     administrative redress procedures to appeal against or seek  review  of
   any                 decision restricting their right to move  and  reside
   freely in the Member                  States on  the  grounds  of  public
   policy, public security or public health (see,                   to  this
   effect, Case C-249/11  Byankov  [2012]  ECR  I-0000,  paragraph  53).  In
     accordance with Article 31(3), the redress procedures must  include  an
          examination of the legality of the decision, as  well  as  of  the
   facts and                    circumstances on which the proposed  measure
   is based.


              53      According to the Court's  settled  case-law,  if  the
   judicial review guaranteed                by Article 47 of the Charter is
   to be effective, the person concerned must be                    able  to
   ascertain the reasons upon  which  the  decision  taken  in  relation  to
     him is based, either by reading the decision itself  or  by  requesting
   and                 obtaining  notification  of  those  reasons,  without
   prejudice to the power of                 the court with jurisdiction  to
   require  the  authority  concerned   to   provide                    that
   information (Joined Cases  C-372/09  and  C-373/09  Peï¿½arroja  Fa  [2011]
     ECR I-1785, paragraph 63, and Case C-430/10 Gaydarov [2011] ECR I-0000,
                  paragraph 41), so as to make it possible for him to defend
   his rights in the                best possible conditions and to  decide,
   with full knowledge of the relevant                facts,  whether  there
   is    any    point    in    his    applying    to    the    court    with
   jurisdiction, and in order to put the latter fully in a position in which
   it may                  carry out the review of  the  lawfulness  of  the
   national decision in question                 (see, to this effect,  Case
   222/86 Heylens and Others [1987] ECR 4097,                      paragraph
   15,  and  Joined  Cases  C-402/05  P  and  C-415/05   P   Kadi   and   Al
   Barakaat International Foundation v Council and Commission [2008] ECR I-
          6351, paragraph 337).


              55      As regards judicial proceedings, the Court has already
   held that, having                regard to the adversarial principle that
   forms part of the rights of  the                     defence,  which  are
   referred  to  in  Article  47  of  the  Charter,   the   parties   to   a
   case must have the right to examine all  the  documents  or  observations
          submitted  to  the  court  for  the  purpose  of  influencing  its
   decision, and to                 comment on  them  (Case  C-450/06  Varec
   [2008] ECR I-581, paragraph 45;               Case C-89/08 P Commission v
   Ireland and Others [2009] ECR I-11245,                      paragraph 52;
   and   Case   C-472/11   Banif    Plus    Bank    [2013]    ECR    I-0000,
   paragraph  30;  see  also,  as  regards  Article  6(1)  of  the  European
   Convention                   for  the  Protection  of  Human  Rights  and
   Fundamental Freedoms, signed in               Rome on  4  November  1950,
   the judgment of the European Court  of  Human                  Rights  in
   Ruiz-Mateos v. Spain, 23 June 1993, ï¿½ 63, Series A no. 262).


              69      In the light of  the  foregoing  considerations,  the
   answer to the question                referred is that Articles 30(2) and
   31 of Directive 2004/38, read in the light                  of Article 47
   of  the  Charter,  must  be  interpreted  as   requiring   the   national
   court with jurisdiction to ensure that failure by the competent  national
              authority to disclose to the person concerned,  precisely  and
   in full, the                 grounds on  which  a  decision  taken  under
   Article 27 of that directive is               based and to  disclose  the
   related   evidence   to   him   is   limited    to    that    which    is
   strictly necessary, and that he is informed, in any event, of the essence
   of                  those grounds in a manner which takes due account  of
   the necessary                    confidentiality of the evidence.


    21. The decision to make a deportation order dated 9th January 2012 was
        served upon the appellant and contains the following text:


              On  22nd  March  2011  at  Leicester  Crown  Court,  you  were
   convicted of robbery,            failing to surrender to  custody  at  an
   appointed tine and convicted of an offence             whilst a community
   order  is  in  force.   The  Secretary  of  State  has   considered   the
   offence of which you have been convicted and your conduct, in  accordance
   with           regulation 21 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)
   Regulations 2006.            She is  satisfied  that  you  would  pose  a
   genuine, present and  sufficiently  serious               threat  to  the
   interests of  public  policy  if  you  were  allowed  to  remain  in  the
     United Kingdom and that your deportation is justified under  regulation
   21. She             has therefore decided under regulation 19 (3)(b) that
   you should be removed and             an order made  in  accordance  with
   regulation 24(3), requiring you to leave the           United Kingdom and
   prohibiting  you  from  re-entering  while  the  order   is   in   force.
   For the purposes of the order section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971
   will           apply.


              The Secretary of State proposes to give  directions  for  your
   removal to Sweden,           the country of which you are a national  and
   where there are reasons to believe            you will be admitted.


    22. A notice of the  right  of  appeal  under  regulation  26  is  also
        included in the notice.


    23. I am satisfied the appellant  received  this  notice  as  there  is
        reference in the chronology of Kim Abbott  to  a  letter  from  One
        Immigration to the local MP dated 17th April 2012 referring to  the
        letter of 9th  January  2012  and  Mr  Blackwood's  own  chronology
        acknowledges such receipt. It is stated that the appellant did  not
        appeal  at  that  time  "apparently  due  to  a   lack   of   legal
        representation". He had contacted his criminal solicitors when made
        aware of the intention to deport who advised him they  were  unable
        to assist him in January 2012, as a result of which he  endeavoured
        to instruct another solicitor. I also note  the  confirmation  that
        the appellant was served by the prison on 11th January 2012.


    24. It is permissible for the notice  of  decision  to  include  or  be
        accompanied by a statement of reasons for  the  decision.  In  this
        case Mr Smart argues the reasons were included in the above notice.
        It is accepted that a person subject to a decision of  this  nature
        must be able to ascertain the reasons upon which the decision taken
        in relation to him is based, either by reading the decision  itself
        or by requesting and obtaining notification of those  reasons  (see
        ZZ above). The reasons why the decision to deport was made  is  set
        out in this document.


    25. There was no further communication from the appellant regarding the
        notice of decision to deport him,  no  indication  he  was  seeking
        legal advice, no notice he  had  been  prevented  from  keeping  an
        arranged appointment as a result of  his  move  within  the  prison
        service and so on 18th January 2012 it  was  said  he  was  'appeal
        rights exhausted' by the case  worker.  On  16th  February  2012  a
        signed deportation order was made which  I  find  remains  a  valid
        order notwithstanding Mr Blackwood's challenge which can only be to
        the legality of the removal on the basis of a  claimed  extant  in-
        country right of appeal. On 26th February it is said the  appellant
        was served with this signed order.  There is also  a  letter  dated
        17th January 2012 headed 'Reasons for Deportation' referring to the
        conviction,  the  appellants  conduct  in   further   detail,   the
        assessment of the risk he posed, his history of offending, and  the
        proportionality  of  the  decision  by  reference   to   the   2006
        Regulations and Article 8 ECHR.  It is accepted that the letter was
        not served at  the  same  time  as  the  decision  to  deport.  The
        requirement is for a person to be informed precisely and  in  full,
        of the public policy, public security or public  heath  grounds  on
        which the decision is  made  (Article  30  (2))  which  raises  the
        question whether this to be read as each and every reason  or  just
        sufficient to enable him to understand  the  case  against  him  in
        relation to the ground being relied upon - i.e. to know the case he
        is  required  to  respond  to?  It  is  arguable  that  the  latter
        proposition is supported by the decision in ZZ. In this appeal  the
        letter  of  17th  January  2012  contains  more  detail  than   the
        information contained in the reasons for deportation decision as it
        is based upon a further analysis of the appellants own conduct  and
        criminality, of which  he  is  aware.  I  find  the  appellant  was
        therefore informed of the  reasons  for  the  deportation  decision
        notwithstanding the existence of the more detailed second  document
        dated 17th January 2012. This is of course a fact specific  finding
        as there may be cases in which one document specifies a reason  but
        a  later  more  detailed  document  contains   fuller   alternative
        reasoning. In such a  case  there  may  be  an  argument  that  the
        requirements of the regulations have not been complied  with  as  a
        result of which time in which to appeal has yet to begin to run.  I
        find the  assessment  must  be  based  upon  consideration  of  the
        substance of the information provided  and  not  just  form  having
        considered the judgment in ZZ.


    26. I also note with interest the letter from One Immigration to  Keith
        Vaz MP dated 17th April 2012 in which they did not raise the matter
        they now seek to rely upon in relation to the  requirement  of  the
        Notice Regulations by reference to 'full reasons' but claim he  was
        not served with appeal forms in relation to the decision to deport.
        The decision set out the right of appeal and  all  the  information
        required by regulation 5 (3) of the Notice Regulations.


    27. In the alternative, if the fact the letter is  more  detailed  than
        the notice of decision justified  a  finding  there  had  not  been
        compliance with the requirements of  the  Notice  Regulations,  and
        therefore time in which to appeal against the  decision  to  deport
        the appellant had not yet began to run, what is the effect?  At  no
        time has an appeal against the decision to deport been  lodged  and
        so Mr Blackwood argues there cannot be said to have been waiver  in
        the sense of the acceptance of a  defective  notice  by  an  appeal
        against the decision on this basis. The chronology  indicates  that
        One  Immigration  were  only  instructed  on   14th   March   2012,
        notwithstanding the appellant being aware of attempts to remove him
        being cancelled before this date and that his removal was imminent.
         A fax was sent  to  UKBA  on  14th  March  to  a  fax  number  One
        Immigration obtained from a form informing the appellant he was the
        subject of a deportation order and was to be removed to  Sweden  on
        16th March 2012. There was no response and so they  sent  a  second
        letter to a different fax number on 16th March 2012. A letter  from
        Kim Abbott, the caseworker, to One  Immigration  dated  19th  March
        2012 states that she did not receive the fax of 14th March 2012 and
        sought the appellant's authority confirming  that  One  Immigration
        were acting on his behalf after which she was  willing  to  provide
        information relating to the appellant's  immigration  status.   One
        Immigration responded on 19th March 2012 with the signed  authority
        but claim in the letter to Keith Vaz not to have received a  reply.
        Notwithstanding the imminent deportation there was  no  application
        for an injunction to prevent removal made to the High Court or  any
        other proceedings such as an application for leave to appeal out of
        time lodged.


    28. On the 10th May 2012 Kim Abbott replied to One Immigration advising
        them that the letters dated 16th and 19th March had been  taken  as
        an application to revoke the deportation order, which was  refused,
        and a notice  explaining  the  decision  and  reasons  served.  One
        Immigration  lodged  an  appeal  against  that  decision   on   the
        proscribed form which can be taken as an acceptance  by  them  that
        the decision to refuse to revoke was a lawful decision,  as  indeed
        it was. The Grounds of Appeal refer to One Immigration's second fax
        specifically asking for it to be  treated  as  an  application  for
        revocation of the deportation order.

    29. The law relating to  a  revocation  of  a  deportation  order  made
        against an EEA national is to be found in  Regulation  24A  of  the
        2006 Regulations which states:


              24A.     (1)       A  deportation  or  exclusion  order  shall
   remain in force unless it                     is revoked by the Secretary
   of State under this regulation.


                  (2)  A person who is subject to a deportation or exclusion
   order                   may apply to the Secretary of State  to  have  it
   revoked if the                        person considered there has been  a
   material  change   in   the                          circumstances   that
   justified the making of the order.


                  (3)  An application under paragraph (2) shall set out  the
   material                     change in circumstances relied upon  by  the
   appellant and may                     only be made whilst  the  applicant
   is outside the United                         Kingdom.


                  (4)  On receipt of an application under paragraph (2), the
   Secretary                    of State  shall  revoke  the  order  if  the
   Secretary of State considers                       that the criteria  for
   making such an order are no longer                          satisfied.


                  (5)  The Secretary of State shall take a  decision  on  an
   application                      under paragraph (2)  no  late  than  six
   months after the date on                      which  the  application  is
   received.


    30. Paragraph 24A (4) was inserted from 16th July 2012


    31. The request by One immigration for  the  deportation  order  to  be
        revoked was refused by the respondent in part because  it  had  not
        been  established  that  there  was  any  material  change  in  the
        circumstances that existed at the time the decision to  deport  the
        appellant was made. The reasons for deportation letter  dated  17th
        January 2012 set out  the  reason  why  the  appellant  was  to  be
        deported by reference to his time in the UK, personal conduct,  and
        assessment of risk. It was noted in the NOMS 1 report that  he  was
        assessed as posing a medium risk of harm to the public and a medium
        risk of re-offending. This demonstrated that a fundamental  element
        of the legal test was considered, namely  the  appellants  personal
        conduct (reg.21 (5)(b)) and the fact  that  such  personal  conduct
        must represent a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
        affecting one of the fundamental interests of  society  (  Reg.  21
        (5)(b)).


    32. Regulation 21(6), relating to the proportionality of the  decision,
        was considered in the  refusal  notice  in  which  the  appellant's
        personal circumstances are noted. In this  regard  it  is  recorded
        that the appellant was contacted on two occasions on 30th June  and
        16th December 2011 but failed to respond and there was  no  further
        information  available  to  the  Secretary  of  State  for  her  to
        consider. The respondent accepted there may be private life per  se
        with his mother and sibling based upon the Offender Managers report
        but did not find it proved that Article 8 ECHR was engaged on  this
        basis. The burden of proving this to be the case  rested  upon  the
        appellant in any event.


    33. It was also noted that although the appellant  first  came  to  the
        attention of the authorities on 6th  December  2002  there  was  no
        evidence he was exercising treaty rights in the UK and there was no
        evidence of any degree  of  integration  either,  or  that  he  had
        developed a private life. The letter states that even if a  private
        life had been developed the  threat  the  appellant  posed  to  the
        public, when all issues were weighed in the balance would made  the
        decision proportionate.


    34. In the respondent's letter dated 8th May 2012 the reasons  for  the
        refusal to revoke the deportation  order  were  given.  The  letter
        refers to correspondence from One Immigration dated 16th March 2012
        in which there is reference to the appellant having a  partner  and
        child in the UK and that the appellant's mother  and  two  siblings
        also reside here. One Immigration asserted  that  no  consideration
        had been given to his relationships in the United Kingdom  and  nor
        had  the  best  interests  of  the  child  been   considered.   The
        respondents view is that as these matters existed at  the  time  of
        the decision to deport it is not accepted they amount to a material
        change in circumstances.


    35. I also note in this regard there is no challenge to  the  fact  the
        appellant  was  given  the  opportunity  to  respond  and   provide
        additional information to the case worker yet failed to do  so.  If
        the existence of these persons was known to the appellant,  but  he
        failed to inform the Secretary of State, she cannot  be  criticised
        for failing to take them into account at the time of  the  original
        decision. The appellant must be responsible for any  failings  that
        may have occurred as a result of his lack of co-operation.


    36. The assessment of threat and risk to the public was  considered  in
        the revocation letter and it is  noted  in  paragraph  22  of  that
        letter that:


              "Your offender manager considered that the underlying  factors
   relating to             your recent aggressive and threatening  behaviour
   are linked to limited            victim awareness, peer group influences,
   high risk taking  behaviour  and  a               lack  of  consequential
   thinking"


    37. The appellant's failure to accept responsibility  for  his  actions
        and to attempt to blame others is noted,  including  the  appellant
        denying  using  intimidating  behaviour.  He  had  not   undertaken
        offender focused work as a result. It was found  there  remained  a
        very real risk of his acting similarly again and  that  any  future
        offences could be of a similar or more serious nature.


    38. Judge Colyer set out his reasoning in relation to the existence  of
        a change in circumstances in paragraph 84 of the determination  and
        found there had been, in his opinion, no  material  change  to  the
        risk posed by the appellant. This is strong justification  for  the
        deportation order remaining in force and shows that the criteria on
        which the order is based, he need to protect the  public  from  the
        consequences a further threat to a fundamental interest (protection
        of the public from crimes of violence) continues to be satisfied.


    39. Evidence of the family dynamics and the existence of  a  child  was
        made available to Judge Colyer who  found  evidence  of  a  limited
        parental relationship between  the  appellant  and  his  child.  In
        paragraph 88 of the determination he found:


              88  I recognise that a significant issue in this case  is  the
   weight to be                 given to the best interests of child who was
   affected by the decision                  to deport one parent from  this
   country and to refuse to revoke that               order.  With in  this,
   however, is a much  more  specific  question:  in                    what
   circumstances  is  it  permissible  to  remove   a   non-citizen   parent
   where the effect will be that a child who is  a  citizen  of  the  United
          Kingdom will also have to leave?


    40. Judge Colyer answered this question, in part, by reference  to  the
        fact that the appellant's removal did  not  require  the  child  to
        leave the United Kingdom as he remains in the care of  his  mother.
        The emotional wellbeing of the child was  considered  [91]  but  it
        noted there were no reports from specialists  and  no  evidence  of
        detrimental effect or adverse educational achievement on the  child
        to date [91].


    41. Judge  Colyer  found  the  best  interests  of  the  child  not  be
        determinative [92].


    42. The issue of rehabilitation was raised by Mr Blackwood and in  this
        regard we now have the guidance from the Upper Tribunal in the case
        of In Essa  (EEA:  rehabilitation/integration)  [2013]  UKUT  00316
        (IAC) it was found:


              3.  For those who at the time of determination are or remain a
   present threat to                public  policy  but  where  the  factors
   relevant  to  integration   suggest   that   there                    are
   reasonable  prospects  of  rehabilitation,  those  prospects  can  be   a
          substantial relevant factor in the proportionality balance  as  to
   whether                 deportation is justified. If the claimant  cannot
   constitute a present threat               when rehabilitated, and is well-
   advanced in rehabilitation in a host state                   where  there
   is a substantial  degree  of  integration,  it  may  well  very  well  be
     disproportionate to proceed to deportation.


              4.  At the other end of the scale, if there are no  reasonable
   prospects  of                      rehabilitation,  the  claimant  is   a
   present threat and is  likely  to  remain  so  for                    the
   indefinite future, it cannot be seen how the prospects of  rehabilitation
              could constitute a significant factor in  the  balance.  Thus,
   recidivist                        offenders,  career   criminals,   adult
   offenders  who  have  failed  to  engage   with                 treatment
   programmes,   claimants   with   propensity   to   commit    sexual    or
   violent offences and the like may well fall into this category.


              5.   What  is  likely  to  be  valuable  to  a  judge  in  the
   immigration jurisdiction who                  is considering risk factors
   is the extent of any progress made by  a  person                   during
   the sentence  and  licence  period,  and  any  material  shift  in  OASys
     assessment of that person.

    43. This is a case in which it has been found Mr Omar remains a present
        threat to public policy. The issue of rehabilitation could  not  be
        considered at the time the original decision was made  and  removal
        as the appellant failed to engage  with  the  Secretary  of  State.
        There are probation services in Sweden and although there is family
        in the United Kingdom it has not been shown that his rehabilitation
        needs, if any, require him to remain in this country. Indeed if the
        appellant has remained out of trouble since his removal  to  Sweden
        he must have progressed with his rehabilitation there.   The  issue
        of rehabilitation is also only one of the relevant  factors  to  be
        considered and not the determinative factor. In this case the  risk
        posed by the appellant and the fact  he  had  not  proved  that  he
        needed to remain in the United  Kingdom  to  rehabilitate  mean  no
        material error was made on this point.


    44. Having considered the evidence provided and findings made with  the
        degree of care required in an appeal of  this  nature  I  find  the
        conclusions of Judge Colyer in relation to the  refusal  to  revoke
        the deportation order were properly open to him on the evidence.


    45. Mr Blackwood's submissions there can only be one appeal at a  time,
        suggesting that until  an  appeal  is  heard  in  relation  to  the
        original decision there cannot be an appeal  against  a  subsequent
        decision to refuse to revoke the order, is not correct.  I  do  not
        find that  failure  to  serve  documents  in  accordance  with  the
        relevant regulations  renders  the  deportation  order  invalid  or
        unlawful, as that has not been proved to be so in  law.  As  stated
        above, the deportation order is a  valid  order,  the  issue  being
        whether the respondent was entitled to enforce that order if  there
        were extant appeal rights. The application to revoke the order must
        be taken as an acknowledgment of this fact as  the  appeal  against
        the refusal was a valid appeal that needed to be considered on  its
        merits.   In SS and Others [2006] UKAIT 00074 it was found that the
        requirements of the Notice  regulations  can  be  waived  in  their
        entirety by proper service of the  notice  of  appeal.  It  may  be
        argued that even though there was no appeal  against  the  original
        decision to deport, the proper service  of  the  notice  of  appeal
        against the refusal to revoke amounts to such a waiver in  relation
        to the validity/lawfulness of the order that  the  refusal  relates
        to.


    46. In summary- I do not accept that the events of 2012 in relation  to
        the service of the decision to deport the appellant and the  notice
        of  reasons  renders  the  deportations  decision  invalid  or  the
        subsequent refusal to revoke unlawful. I do not find it proved that
        Judge Colyer erred in law in  dismissing  the  appeal  against  the
        refusal as he was entitled to do so, on the evidence. If the act of
        removal was unlawful the appellant may have  a  remedy  in  another
        jurisdiction, which, if this is the  case,  is  something  that  he
        perhaps should have considered exercising  some  time  ago  (if  he
        considers a claim for damages or declaration  of  legality/quashing
        order is justified).

          I make no such order as there was no application for the same  and
   no             justification for such an order proved.
