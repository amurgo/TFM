Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Halim, Counsel; Birnberg Peirce & Partners
For the Respondent:    Ms S Sreeraman, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. For ease of  comprehension,  the  parties  are  referred  to  by  their
    appellate status and positions before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  Nicholls  allowing  the  Appellant's  appeal
    against the Secretary of State's  decision  to  remove  him  under  the
    provisions of Regulation 19(3) of the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006 ("2006 Regulations").

 3.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated  its  decision   allowing   the
    Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision on 2 June 2015.

 4.  The  Respondent  appealed  against  that  decision  and  was   granted
    permission to appeal by First-tier Tribunal Judge Heynes.  The  grounds
    upon which permission was granted may be summarised as follows:

      i) It is arguable that the judge erred in failing to make a finding on
         whether the Appellant had acquired a permanent right of residence.

 5. I was provided with a Rule 24 response from the Appellant  (drafted  by
    alternate counsel). I was also provided with  a  copy  of  MG  (prison-
    Article 28(3) (a) of Citizens Directive) [2014] UKUT 392  (IAC)  by  Ms
    Sreeraman. These documents  were  available  to  the  all  parties  and
    sufficient time was given prior to the  hearing  in  order  that  those
    documents could be comprehensively addressed.

 6. It is of note that the Respondent made several concessions  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal which are reflected at �2 of the determination.  It
    is  not  suggested  by  Ms  Sreeraman  that  those   concessions   were
    incorrectly made her junior colleague nor incorrectly recorded  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

No Error of Law

 7. I do not find that there was an error of law in the decision such  that
    it should be set aside. My reasons for so finding follow shortly.

 8. Turning to the  Respondent's  main  ground,  the  judge  is  criticised
    because of an alleged failure to make  a  finding  as  to  whether  the
    Appellant had acquired a permanent right of residence.

 9. Ms Sreeraman first submitted  that  the  judge's  findings  to  support
    contention that permanent  right  of  residence  is  acquired  are  not
    supported by the evidence. I reject that submission. It is  clear  from
    paragraph 1 of the Respondent's grounds that  the  submissions  therein
    represent nothing more than a mere disagreement with the  findings  and
    outcome of the appeal.

10. Ms Sreeraman next submitted that at �15 of the determination, the judge
    accepts that the documentary evidence in the Appellant's bundle  showed
    that he had resided for 13 years but the judge had made no  finding  on
    whether acquired permanent residence. She contended  that  there  is  a
    requirement under Regulation 21(3) of the  2006  Regulations  that  the
    judge acknowledge that permanent residence was met before  being  in  a
    position to turn  to  whether  imperative  grounds  are  required.  She
    submitted that the issue outlined by the  judge  at  �4  had  not  been
    resolved.

11. In relation to the resolution of the issue of  permanent  residence,  I
    find that it is apparent from the judge's  findings  at  �15  that  the
    Appellant had acquired a permanent right of residence. This is so given
    that the judge finds that the documentary evidence since 2000 shows:

         "... a consistent and coherent record of life in the  UK  which  is
         sufficient to  show  that  the  Appellant  had,  on  a  balance  of
         probabilities, lived in the UK for at least 13 years at the date of
         imprisonment. I  find,  therefore,  that  he  has  shown  that  the
         decision to remove him  should  have  been  considered  within  the
         provisions of regulation 21(4)".

12. It is clear from the above that the judge has found that the  Appellant
    has maintained his life in the UK for  at  least  13  years  given  his
    "whole range"  of  official  documents  including  "education,  medical
    records, income tax records, JobCentre records of training  and  search
    for employment as well as payslips and  job  applications".  Therefore,
    the judge has made findings that the Appellant  was  exercising  treaty
    rights in one form or  another  for  at  least  13  years  pursuant  to
    Regulation 6 of  the  2006  Regulations,  including  time  spent  as  a
    jobseeker. That implicitly resulted in the acquisition of  a  permanent
    right  of  residence  pursuant  to  Regulation  15(1)(a)  of  the  2006
    Regulations. Therefore, I find that the judge did not omit  to  resolve
    the issue of whether the Appellant had acquired the permanent right  of
    residence or not.

13. Notwithstanding the above findings, for the  purpose  of  deciding  the
    application of Regulation 21(4) of  the  2006  Regulations  so  far  as
    necessary in considering the Respondent's grounds, it will be useful to
    set out the statute in relevant part:

         '21. Decisions taken on public policy, public security  and  public
         health grounds

         (1)  In this regulation a "relevant decision" means an EEA decision
         taken on the grounds of public policy, public  security  or  public
         health.

         (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.

         (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
         with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15  except  on
         serious grounds of public policy or public security.

         (4)  A relevant decision may not  be  taken  except  on  imperative
         grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

             (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period
             of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or

             (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision  is
             necessary in his  best  interests,  as  provided  for  in  the
             Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted by  the  General
             Assembly of the United Nations on 20th November 1989(a).

         (5)  Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public policy
         or public security it shall, in  addition  to  complying  with  the
         preceding paragraphs of this regulation,  be  taken  in  accordance
         with the following principles-

             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
             proportionality;

             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
             conduct of the person concerned;

             (c)   the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
             represent a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
             affecting one of the fundamental interests of society;

             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
             which relate to considerations of general  prevention  do  not
             justify the decision;

             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
             themselves justify the decision.'

14. From the above, it is clear that the Appellant benefits from Regulation
    21(4)(a) given that the judge has found that the Appellant has  resided
    in the UK for a continuous period of 13 years, exceeding the  requisite
    10 years.

15. Notwithstanding the above findings, I was asked by both parties to make
    a finding upon whether Regulation 21(4)(a) requires  the  Appellant  to
    have acquired a permanent right of residence before it can be  engaged.
    Given my findings above at paragraph 12, this portion of my decision is
    clearly to be read as obiter  dicta.  Nonetheless,  for  my  part,  the
    wording of Regulation 21(4)(a) is distinct in omitting any  mention  of
    the acquisition of permanent status before one can  benefit  from  that
    part. It is obvious that the higher form of protection is gauged in the
    number of years of continuous residence spent, rather than by acquiring
    status as a permanent resident as a condition precedent to that  higher
    protection. This omission  to  mention  the  acquisition  of  permanent
    resident status is also reflected in recital 24 and Article 28(3)(a) of
    Directive 2004/38/EC which state as follows:

         '(24)    Accordingly, the greater  the  degree  of  integration  of
         Union citizens and their family members in the host  Member  State,
         the greater the degree of protection against expulsion  should  be.
         Only in  exceptional  circumstances,  where  there  are  imperative
         grounds of public security, should an expulsion  measure  be  taken
         against Union citizens who have  resided  for  many  years  in  the
         territory of the host Member State, in particular  when  they  were
         born and have resided there throughout  their  life.  In  addition,
         such exceptional circumstances should also apply  to  an  expulsion
         measure taken against minors, in order to protect their links  with
         their family, in accordance with the United Nations  Convention  on
         the Rights of the Child, of 20 November 1989.




         Article 28

         Protection against expulsion

         ...

         3.   An expulsion decision may not be taken against Union citizens,
         except if the decision is based on  imperative  grounds  of  public
         security, as defined by Member States, if they:

             (a)  have resided in the host Member State for the previous 10
             years'

16. I am further guided in this view by [14] of LG (Italy) v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2008] EWCA Civ 190 wherein Carnwath,  LJ
    (as he then was) stated as follows:

         "The hierarchy and the "imperative grounds" test

      1. As appears from the emphasised words above in regulation 21(1)-(4),
         the 2006 Regulations have introduced a new hierarchy of  levels  of
         protection, based on criteria of increasing stringency:

             1)   A general criterion that removal may be justified "on the
             grounds of public policy, public security or public health";

             2)   A more  specific  criterion,  applicable  to  those  with
             permanent rights of residence, that they may  not  be  removed
             "except  on  serious  grounds  of  public  policy  or   public
             security";

             3)   The most stringent criterion, applicable to a person "who
             has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous  period  of
             at least ten years prior to the relevant  decision",  who  may
             not  be  removed  except  on  "imperative  grounds  of  public
             security".

         The regulations provide no further guidance on the meaning of these
         expressions."

17. As stated above, the regulations provide no  further  guidance  on  the
    meaning of these expressions and consequently, I  am  unable  to  reach
    more than a discursive view on this matter, without  more.  It  appears
    that a similar topic arose at [36-39] of Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department v FV (Italy) [2012] EWCA  Civ  1199,  however  in  that
    matter the Respondent accepted that  permanent  residence  had  already
    been acquired.

18. There was passing discussion upon this subject at [46-50] of LG and  CC
    (EEA Regs: residence; imprisonment; removal) Italy [2009] UKAIT  00024,
    wherein Carnwath, LJ (as he then  was)  stated  as  follows,  following
    remittal of the LG (Italy) appeal to the Tribunal:

         "Question (a) - What constitutes  residence  for  the  purposes  of
         regulation 15(1)(a) -  right  of  permanent  residence  after  five
         years' legal residence in the United Kingdom?

         "Legal" residence

          1.  As  already  noted,  we  have  used  the  expression   "legal
             residence" in question (a) because Article  16.1  accords  the
             right of permanent  residence  to  "Union  citizens  who  have
             resided legally for a continuous period of five years  in  the
             host Member State". Regulation 15(1)(a) does not use  that  or
             any equivalent term, but requires the five years' residence in
             the  United  Kingdom  to  be   "in   accordance   with   these
             Regulations". It is necessary to consider whether there is any
             material difference between the two expressions.

          1. The  Secretary  of  State's  position  is  that  there  is  no
             difference.  In  order  to  acquire  a  right   of   permanent
             residence, a person must demonstrate that, during  any  period
             upon  which  it  is  sought  to  rely  for  the   purpose   of
             establishing the requisite five years' residence,  he  or  she
             was in the United Kingdom, exercising a Treaty right; that  is
             to  say  as  a  "qualified  person"  within  the  meaning   of
             regulation 6 (e.g. a job seeker, worker or student)  or  as  a
             relevant family member of such a person (within the  scope  of
             the Regulations). The expression used by  the  Regulations  is
             consistent with recital 17 of the Preamble  to  the  Directive
             which speaks in the same context of five years  residence  "in
             compliance with the conditions laid down in this Directive".

          1. Ms Hulse and Mr Karnik, on the other hand, contended that this
             interpretation  is  too  narrow.  Although  neither  submitted
             expressly that mere physical  presence  in  this  country  was
             sufficient, both contended that rights of  residence  in  host
             Member States, deriving from the Treaty, were wider in  nature
             and that, even if a person could not at any  particular  point
             in time be described as a "qualified person" etc., he  or  she
             might nevertheless be lawfully in the United Kingdom  for  the
             purposes of the Directive and the Regulations.

          1. This issue in our view must now be  regarded  as  settled,  at
             least up to the Court of Appeal. We have already noted Stanley
             Burnton LJ's statement in HR (Portugal) that:

                  "... it is clear from recital 23 that 'legally' in Article
                  16 means 'in the  exercise  of  the  rights  and  freedoms
                  conferred on them by the  Treaty',  as  was  held  by  the
                  Tribunal in GN (EEA Regulations:  five  years'  residence)
                  Hungary [2007] UKAIT 00073" (paragraph 22).

          1. The quotation from  recital  23  is  taken  from  the  passage
             dealing generally with integration, and is arguably wider than
             the formula in recital 16,  which  relates  to  the  right  of
             permanent residence. That refers  specifically  to  compliance
             with the conditions of the Directive  rather  than  to  rights
             under the Treaty. However, since the point had been  conceded,
             and nothing turned on the different wording, there was no need
             for the Court to discuss it in any detail."

19. The above passage from the LG (Italy)  line  of  thought  reflects  the
    purposive European approach  to  interpretation  of  the  Directive  in
    relation to recitals 16 and 23 against Article 16. It appears that  the
    judgment of HR (Portugal) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Office
    [2009] EWCA Civ 371 has  further  guidance  to  offer  in  relation  to
    recital 24 and Article 28 at [21] of Stanley Burnton, LJ's judgment:

         "21. Recital 23 is implemented in Articles 16 and 28.2; recital  24
             is implemented in Article 28.3. What is significant in recital
             24 is, first,  the  linkage  with  recital  23,  signalled  by
             "Accordingly" and the comparative adjective "greater"  applied
             to "integration". "Integration" itself is explained in recital
             23. It relates to "persons who, having availed  themselves  of
             the rights and freedoms conferred on them by the Treaty,  have
             become genuinely integrated into the host Member State". These
             recitals show that what was intended was a progression in  the
             restrictions  on  expulsion,  depending  on  the   degree   of
             integration of a person in the country in which he is  present
             as demonstrated by  the  duration  of  his  residence  in  the
             exercise of Treaty rights. In my  view  it  follows  that  the
             Member States did not  intend  the  restriction  on  expulsion
             envisaged in recital 24 to be applicable to someone  who  does
             not qualify for the protection envisaged by recital 23. It  is
             clear from recital 24 that the reason for the  restriction  on
             the right of the state to expel someone who has been  in  this
             country for many years is his integration into  this  country.
             Recital 24 does not envisage that the restriction on expulsion
             to which it refers should be applicable to a  person  who  has
             not availed himself of the rights and  freedoms  conferred  on
             him by the Treaty, but has been compulsorily detained in  this
             country."

20. The above passage indicates therefore that the wording of Article 28 is
    to be viewed with recital 24 in mind which makes clear that  the  Court
    of Appeal has viewed the higher form of protection  from  expulsion  as
    applicable "...depending on the degree of integration of  a  person  in
    the country in which he is present as demonstrated by the  duration  of
    his residence in the exercise of Treaty rights".  Therefore,  it  would
    appear that notwithstanding that Article 28(3) is framed  in  terms  of
    the duration of residence and does not explicitly  mention  acquisition
    of status as a condition precedent  to  engaging  the  higher  form  of
    protection, Article 28(3) is to be read in light of recital 24 that the
    residence of at least 10 years must be in pursuance of the exercise  of
    Treaty rights. It appears therefore that as long as that  condition  is
    met, it does not matter whether a confirmation of  exercise  of  Treaty
    rights and a right to reside has  been  previously  obtained  from  the
    Secretary of State. However, given that the 10 years residence must  be
    spent in exercise of Treaty rights, it would follow implicitly that  if
    one has exercised those rights for at least 10 years,  one  would  also
    automatically have acquired the permanent  right  of  residence  having
    already completed the shorter 5 year period to qualify for that status.



21. Finally, in terms of the complaint concerning the Tribunal's failure to
    take account of the Appellant's integration into society,  to  my  mind
    that complaint is  unfounded  as  the  discussion  within  �15  of  the
    determination demonstrates the judge  has  discharged  that  very  task
    before stating in terms that the Appellant has resided in  the  UK  for
    at least 13 years since 2000, before his imprisonment, making a finding
    on integration implicit from the years of residence spent in the UK  by
    the Appellant exercising treaty rights.

22. Consequently, given my findings above, the grounds  do  not  reveal  an
    error of law such that the decision should be set aside.

Decision

23. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

24. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is affirmed.
