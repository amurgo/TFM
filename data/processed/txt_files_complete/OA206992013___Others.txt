Representation:
For the Appellants: Ms E Heikkila, instructed by Asghar & Co Solicitors
For the Respondents: Mr D Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.  The  appellants,  nationals  of  Somalia,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
  Tribunal against the decisions of an Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) of  17
  October 2013 to refuse their applications  for  entry  clearance  as  the
  partner (first appellant) and children (second and third  appellants)  of
  Ahmed Farah Sharif Osman, the sponsor. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Devitte
  dismissed the appeals and the appellants now appeal  with  permission  to
  this Tribunal.

2. The ECO refused the applications under Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
  Rules. The ECO decided that the following requirements had not been met;

   . EC-P.1.1(c) - the sponsor had failed to  give  a  written  undertaking
     that he would be  responsible  for  the  appellants'  maintenance  and
     accommodation;


   . EC-P.1.1(d) - the first appellant had not submitted  any  evidence  to
     show that she is married to the sponsor as claimed or that  they  have
     been part of a family unit. The second and third  appellants  had  not
     submitted any evidence to show that they are related as claimed to the
     sponsor;


   . E-ECP.3.1, EC-C 1.1 and Appendix FM-SE - the appellants had failed  to
     show that  they met the income threshold requirement. The sponsor  was
     required to show that he had an income of �24,800 per  annum  and  the
     evidence provided did not  show  that  and  he  did  not  provide  the
     specified documents;


   . In relation to the first appellant - she had not demonstrated that she
     met the English language requirement set out in E-ECP 4.1.


3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge heard oral evidence from  the  sponsor  and
  also considered the  documentary  evidence  before  concluding  that  the
  appellants had not demonstrated that the financial requirements had  been
  met. The Judge further found that the first appellant did  not  meet  the
  English language requirement  and  that  the  sponsor  had  not  given  a
  coherent explanation of the difficulties he  claimed  had  prevented  her
  from taking  the  English  language  test  in  Ethiopia.  The  First-tier
  Tribunal Judge considered the appeal under  Article  8  of  the  European
  Convention on Human Rights and accepted that the decisions interfere with
  the family life between the sponsor and the appellants however  he  found
  that the interference was proportionate to the  public  interest.  Whilst
  not noted in the decision, Mr Clarke indicated that due to  DNA  evidence
  provided, the issue of the  relationship  between  the  sponsor  and  the
  appellants was conceded at the hearing.

Error of Law

4. It is contended in the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal  that  the
  First-tier Tribunal Judge applied  the  wrong  maintenance  threshold  in
  considering the maintenance requirement. The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
  said that the sponsor had to show that he earned a minimum  gross  income
  of �22,400. It is contended  that  in  fact  the  relevant  threshold  is
  �24,800 as set out in the refusal notices. I accept that the Judge made a
  factual error in misstating the relevant threshold.

5. It is  further  contended  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  that  the  Judge
  miscalculated the sponsor's gross annual  income.  At  the  date  of  the
  decision the sponsor was said to be employed in  two  jobs,  working  for
  Manpower Ltd and Clearway Care Ltd. The Judge accepted that the appellant
  produced payslips from both employers.  However  the  appellant  produced
  only two P60s, both from Manpower from the years  ending  2013  and  2014
  which reflected a gross annual income of �4871 and  �10800  respectively.
  The Judge therefore found that the sponsor fell 'far  short'  of  meeting
  the maintenance threshold [4].

6. It is contended in the grounds of appeal that the payslips from  Manpower
  showed average gross weekly earnings of �360 which equates to �18,720 per
  annum and the payslips from Clearway show a gross weekly income  of  �180
  which equates to �9,360 per annum. It is  contended  that  this  gives  a
  total annual income of �28,080 which exceeds the  maintenance  threshold.
  It is contended that  the  P60s  only  relate  to  Manpower  and  do  not
  therefore reflect the sponsor's total income.

7. Mr Clarke accepted that the consideration  given  by  the  Judge  to  the
  financial requirements at paragraph 4 is not detailed. He  also  accepted
  that the Judge made a mistake in relation to the relevant  threshold  but
  submitted that this was not a material error. Mr  Clarke  submitted  that
  the relevant period for calculation of the sponsor's income is  24  March
  2013- 24 September 2013, being six months prior to  the  application.  He
  submitted that there are only 4 payslips from that period from  Manpower.
  He submitted that there is only  one  payslip  from  Clearway  from  that
  period. He further submitted  that  the  sponsor  has  not  provided  the
  requisite six months' banks statements or letters from his  employers  as
  required by Appendix FM-SE. He submitted that the P60 for 2014 post dates
  the decision and cannot be considered and that the  P60  for  2013  shows
  earnings of only �4871. He  submitted  that  the  Judge  could  not  have
  reached any other conclusion on the evidence before him.

8. Ms Heikkila submitted that  paragraph  4  is  not  detailed  enough.  She
  accepted that the documents provided to  the  Judge  were  not  complete.
  However she submitted that  it  is  possible  to  calculate  the  average
  earnings from the documents provided. She also accepted  that  the  Judge
  would have had to piece the evidence together  to  calculate  the  annual
  income.

9. The appellants were represented at  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
  Tribunal Judge. They submitted a bundle of documents.  I  do  not  accept
  that it would have been appropriate for the Judge in these  circumstances
  to piece the evidence together and work out the sponsor's average  income
  based on incomplete documentary evidence. The appellants were required to
  demonstrate, by providing the evidence set out at  Appendix  FM-SE,  that
  they met the income requirements at the date of the  decision.  They  did
  not do so. They provided a few weekly payslips relating to the  sponsor's
  employment which was insufficient evidence on which  to  base  a  finding
  that he earned the required amount  over  the  relevant  period.  On  the
  evidence before him the Judge could not have found  that  the  appellants
  met the financial requirements. The Judge's  error  in  relation  to  the
  threshold is not material as the appellants could not  meet  the  correct
  threshold in any event.

10. Mr Clarke submitted that there is no evidence that the English  language
  test cannot be taken in Ethiopia. The Judge concluded that the  sponsor's
  oral evidence on this matter was not coherent. I am satisfied that  there
  was insufficient evidence before the Judge to support a finding that  the
  first appellant was exempt from the  English  language  requirement.  The
  Judge's findings on Article 8 were open to him in light of  his  findings
  in relation to the Immigration Rules and it was open to the Judge to take
  into account the appellants' failure to meet the Immigration Rules.

Conclusion:
The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on point of law. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
shall stand.

Signed
