             IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW


                                   Before

                      MR C M G OCKELTON, VICE PRESIDENT

Applicant.

behalf of the Respondent

                                  JUDGMENT

   1. This is an application for judicial review.  The  decision  challenged
      in the grounds is a deportation order dated 16 June 2014.   Permission
      was refused on the papers but granted on limited grounds by HHJ Robert
      Owen QC on oral renewal.


   History


   2. The applicant is a national of Bangladesh.  He was born  in  1977  and
      arrived in the United Kingdom  in  1987  and  was  granted  indefinite
      leave.  His presence in the United Kingdom has always been with leave.
       The motivation for the Secretary State's decision is a long series of
      criminal offences.


   3. The applicant's known offending history began in  November  2001.   He
      had one court appearance resulting in a conviction in that year, three
      in 2003, six in 2004, one each in 2005 and 2006, three in 2007, one in
      2008, one in 2009, four in 2011, four in 2012 and at  least  three  in
      2013.  On the Secretary of State's calculation, between November  2001
      and October 2013 he had been convicted on 29 occasions  for  49  known
      offences.  In 2009 he was notified of his  liability  to  deportation.
      Although he continued to offend, no action was taken  against  him  at
      that stage.   On  20  July  2012  there  was  a  decision  to  make  a
      deportation order against him, based on his offending.  He appealed to
      a First-tier Tribunal, constituted of Judge Hanratty and  Sir  Jeffrey
      James.  That panel allowed his appeal "with some  reluctance",  having
      reached the conclusion that the application of the  immigration  rules
      to the findings of fact it had made meant, as it said at [64]:


           "that in accordance with the  Immigration  Rules  the  appellant
           does escape from the normal consequences of his  persistent  and
           serial offending by virtue of paragraph 399A of the  Immigration
           Rules."


   4. In its closing observations  at  [72]  (that  is,  the  first  of  two
      paragraphs numbered 72), the panel said this:


           "The appellant must be under  no  illusion  that  any  more  re-
           offending and this Tribunal would expect the respondent to carry
           out  most  effective  and  determined  efforts  to  remove  this
           appellant from the jurisdiction.  He has been warned."


   5. The Tribunal's determination was sent out on 23 October 2012.  In  the
      following year the applicant was convicted of  the  following  further
      offences:


           (i)   Harassment - breach of restraining order - on  a  plea  of
               guilty - fined �50 and        one day detention.


           (ii)  18th February 2013 - harassment -  breach  of  restraining
               order - on a plea of        guilty fined �110  and  one  day
               deemed served in courthouse.


           (iii)  30th August 2013 - possession controlled drug class  B  -
               cannabis - plea -  guilty         -  fine  �100  and  victim
               surcharge �20.


           (iv)   1st October 2013 - battery - plea guilty  -  imprisonment
           sixteen weeks.


            (v)   Offences of common assault and  destruction  of  property
               dating from 23rd April 2013 but dealt with  on  1st  October
               2013 - imprisonment sixteen weeks concurrent and no separate
               penalty for destruction to property.


      There appears also to have been a court appearance on 5 December  2012
      but the outcome is not clear: there is a mention both of an  acquittal
      and of the applicant being fined �50.


   6. On 23 October 2013 the Secretary of State made a new decision to  make
      a deportation order against the applicant.   The  applicant  appealed.
      The appeal was heard in the First-tier Tribunal  by  Judge  Ford,  who
      dismissed it in a determination sent out on 16 April 2014.


   7. There was no attempt to appeal Judge Ford's determination,  as  indeed
      there  had  been  no  attempt  to   appeal   the   previous   Tribunal
      determination.  On 20 May 2014, however,  the  applicant's  solicitors
      made further representations, including evidence  of  new  facts,  and
      asked the Secretary of State not to proceed with  the  deportation  of
      the applicant.  It was not suggested that there were any  grounds  for
      appealing Judge Ford's decision, but simply that  there  were  reasons
      why the Secretary of State might be moved  not  to  act  on  it.   The
      Secretary of  State  was  not  persuaded.   A  letter  confirming  her
      original decision was sent on 10 June 2014, and on 16  June  2014  the
      deportation order was made.


   8. It is now common ground that that order was erroneous, as pointed  out
      in the applicant's judicial  review  grounds.   That  is  because  the
      Secretary of State purported to make a  deportation  order  under  the
      "automatic deportation" provisions of the UK Borders Act 2007, whereas
      the applicant was not liable to deportation  under  those  provisions.
      The deportation order was replaced on 30 June 2014 by  an  order  made
      simply on the basis of s 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act  1971  because
      the Secretary of State deemed it to be conducive to the public good to
      deport the applicant from the United Kingdom.  It is that  replacement
      deportation order which is thus the focus of the  present  proceedings
      now.


   9. The grant of permission to apply  for  judicial  review  is  (omitting
      directions) in the following terms:


          "Permission to bring judicial  review  proceedings  on  the  issue
          concerning Devaslaelan- v - SSHD (2002) UK1 at 702 [sic] only."

      It is clear that that is intended, in line with the  argument  put  to
      the learned judge (which Mr Nicholson has shown me), to be a reference
      to the decision of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in Devaseelan v
      SSHD [2002] UKIAT 00282, [2003] Imm AR 1.


      The Law

  10. In view of the  limited  grounds  of  challenge,  and  Mr  Nicholson's
      focused attention to them, there are only three areas of the law  that
      need to be set out.  The first  is  paragraphs  396  to  399B  of  the
      Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules, HC 395 as in force  between
      9 July 2012 and 28 July 2014, a period which covers both the decisions
      to make deportation orders, both the appeal hearings and the making of
      the deportation order itself in this case.


                "396.  Where  a  person  is  liable  to   deportation   the
           presumption  shall  be  that  the   public   interest   requires
           deportation.  It is in the public interest to deport  where  the
           Secretary of State must make a deportation order  in  accordance
           with section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007.


               397.  A deportation order will not be  made  if  a  person's
           removal pursuant to the order would  be  contrary  to  the  UK's
           obligations under the Refugee Convention  or  the  Human  Rights
           Convention.  Where deportation would not be  contrary  to  these
           obligations, it will only be in exceptional  circumstances  that
           the public interest in deportation is outweighed.


           398. Where a person  claims  that  their  deportation  would  be
           contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8  of  the  Human
           Rights Convention, and


                 (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive
           to the public good  because  they  have  been  convicted  of  an
           offence for which they  have  been  sentenced  to  a  period  of
           imprisonment of at least 4 years;
                 (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive
           to the public good  because  they  have  been  convicted  of  an
           offence for which they  have  been  sentenced  to  a  period  of
           imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12 months; or
               (c) the deportation of the person from the UK  is  conducive
           to the public good because, in the  view  of  the  Secretary  of
           State, their offending has caused serious harm  or  they  are  a
           persistent offender who shows a  particular  disregard  for  the
           law, the  Secretary  of  State  in  assessing  that  claim  will
           consider whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if  it  does
           not, it will only  be  in  exceptional  circumstances  that  the
           public interest in  deportation  will  be  outweighed  by  other
           factors.


            399.  This paragraph applies where paragraph  398  (b)  or  (c)
           applies if -
                 (a) the person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
           relationship with a child under the age of 18 years  who  is  in
           the UK, and
                  (i)   the child is a British Citizen; or
                  (ii) the child has lived in the UK  continuously  for  at
                  least the 7 years immediately preceding the date  of  the
                  immigration decision; and in either case
                     (a) it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to
                     leave the UK; and
                     (b) there is no other family member  who  is  able  to
                     care for the child in the UK;
           or


               (b) the person has a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
           with a partner who is in  the  UK  and  is  a  British  Citizen,
           settled  in  the  UK,  or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or
           humanitarian protection, and
                  (i) the person has lived  in  the  UK  with  valid  leave
                  continuously  for  at  least  the  15  years  immediately
                  preceding  the   date   of   the   immigration   decision
                  (discounting any period of imprisonment); and
                  (ii) there are insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life
                  with that partner continuing outside the UK.


            399A.  This paragraph applies where  paragraph  398(b)  or  (c)
           applies if -
             (a) the person has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20
           years immediately preceding the date of the immigration decision
           (discounting any period of imprisonment)  and  he  has  no  ties
           (including social, cultural or family) with the country to which
           he would have to go if required to leave the UK; or
              (b) the person is aged under 25 years, he has spent at  least
           half  his  life  living  continuously  in  the  UK   immediately
           preceding  the  date  of  the  of   the   immigration   decision
           (discounting any period of imprisonment)  and  he  has  no  ties
           (including social, cultural or family) with the country to which
           he would have to go if required to leave the UK.


            399B. Where paragraph 399 or 399A applies limited leave may  be
           granted for a period not exceeding 30 months.  Such leave  shall
           be given subject to such conditions as the  Secretary  of  State
           deems appropriate."


  11. The word "may" in paragraph 399B is  the  routine  expression  in  the
      Immigration Rules where the grant of leave may be expected to  be  the
      result of  complying  with  conditions  set  out  in  the  immediately
      preceding paragraphs.  The provisions as a whole were described by the
      Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 at [44] as
      "a complete code"; see also SSHD v MA (Somalia) [2015] EWCA Civ 48.


  12. Secondly, Devaseelan is a "starred" determination of  the  Asylum  and
      Immigration Tribunal arising out of the implementation  of  the  Human
      Rights Act 1998 on 1 October 2000.  In a number  of  cases  applicants
      for asylum, whose claims had been refused by the  Secretary  of  State
      and whose appeals had been dismissed, subsequently raised claims based
      on (in particular) article 3  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human
      Rights.  The question was the extent to which findings of fact in  the
      asylum appeal ought to be taken into account in the  determination  of
      an appeal against a subsequent refusal of a human  rights  claim.   At
      paragraphs 37 to 42 the Tribunal set  out  guidance  to  the  judicial
      officers then called adjudicators,  exercising  the  jurisdiction  now
      exercised by the First-tier Tribunal.  I do not propose to set it  out
      in full.  It may be summarised as  follows.   The  second  adjudicator
      should always take the first adjudicator's determination as a starting
      point.  The second adjudicator should be cautious of allowing  matters
      determined by the first adjudicator to be litigated before the  second
      adjudicator on the same evidence.  New evidence about matters personal
      to  the  appellant,  that  could  have  been  put  before  the   first
      adjudicator but was not, might be regarded with considerable  caution,
      unless there is some very good reason why the evidence was not adduced
      earlier.  New facts (that is to  say  evidence  of  matters  occurring
      since the first determination), or material that may have been  before
      the first adjudicator but which was not relevant to the issues  before
      him, can always be taken into account by the  second  adjudicator  and
      may result in a different determination.  The  second  adjudicator  is
      not bound by the first adjudicator's findings or by his determination.
       The second adjudicator  is  hearing  a  new  appeal,  against  a  new
      decision, and at a different time; but the  guidance  is  intended  to
      ensure economy and  consistency  in  judicial  determinations,  whilst
      recognising that the appeals are separate.


  13. The Devaseelan guidelines have the approval of the Court of Appeal  in
      LD (Algeria) v SSHD [2004] EWCA  Civ  804,  and  elsewhere.   Although
      because of  the  context  in  which  they  arose  the  guidelines  are
      expressed in terms assuming that the individual  was  unsuccessful  in
      the first appeal, they have been  taken  to  be  generally  applicable
      where a person comes before a Tribunal on a second occasion; and there
      have occasionally been signs of an  extension  of  the  principles  to
      appeals by individuals related to an earlier appellant.


  14. Thirdly, and nothing to do with Devaseelan, there is  clear  authority
      for the proposition that the Secretary of State is required to act  on
      a final decision of the Tribunal allowing an appellant's  appeal.   Mr
      Nicholson cites authorities from R v SSHD ex parte Mersin [2000]  EWHC
      348 (Admin), through R (Boafo) v SSHD [2002] EWCA Civ 44 to Chomanga v
      SSHD [2011] UKUT 312 (IAC).


   The Tribunal Determinations


  15. Both of the determinations of the  First-tier  Tribunal  include  full
      considerations of evidence and discussions of the  relevant  law.   No
      discourtesy is implied by looking only at the parts of them which have
      formed the subject of submissions  in  the  present  judicial  review.
      Each  starts  from  the  position  that  the  applicant  falls  within
      paragraph 398(c).  Each  continues  by  considering  whether,  on  the
      evidence, paragraph 399 or 399A applies.  The applicant's case against
      his deportation was based with  varying  levels  of  strength  on  the
      following three factors:


        a) His relationship with his two children from a marriage in  2000.
           The couple separated in 2005, but it does not appear  that  they
           have ever divorced;


        b) His relationship with Allison Armstrong, who was  said  to  have
           been in a relationship with the applicant from about 2007;


        c) His long residence in the United Kingdom and the lack of ties to
           Bangladesh.


  16. Both the Tribunal in 2012 and Judge Ford  in  2014  decided  that  the
      applicant's contacts with his children were not of such a nature  that
      they fell for consideration under paragraph 399(a).


  17. The Tribunal in 2012 examined the evidence of  his  relationship  with
      Allison  Armstrong  in  some  detail.   It   had   been   a   troubled
      relationship; a number of the applicant's convictions are for offences
      against her.  It accepted  her  "emotional"  evidence  supporting  the
      applicant and found that they hoped to get married and to start a  new
      life in a different part of the country, and, in addition, that to  an
      extent she was dependent on the applicant.  The panel found that there
      were insurmountable obstacles to a family life with her in Bangladesh.
       In 2014 Judge Ford reached a different conclusion, which was that the
      evidence  of  the  applicant  and  Allison   Armstrong   about   their
      relationship was lacking in credibility.  There  were  a  considerable
      number of discrepancies: they  differed  even  on  whether  they  were
      married and whether they lived together.  Judge Ford's  evaluation  of
      the applicant's  evidence  was  that  she  did  not  accept  that  the
      applicant was committed to Ms Armstrong  or  genuinely  believed  that
      there was a future to the relationship.  Thus,  paragraph  399(b)  did
      not apply at the date of the determination in 2014.  I may add,  as  a
      postscript, that despite the applicant's avowals at the hearing on  26
      March 2014, he wrote to the Secretary of State less than a month after
      receiving Judge Ford's determination, saying that he had  decided  not
      to continue the relationship with Ms Armstrong.


  18. So far as paragraph 399A is concerned, the  position  is  as  follows.
      The Tribunal hearing the  applicant's  appeal  in  2012  had  evidence
      before it, including, as Mr Nicholson wished to emphasise  before  me,
      evidence showing a number of visits to  Bangladesh.   The  submissions
      made to the Tribunal, by (as it happens) Mr Nicholson, and recorded in
      paragraph 53 of the determination are as follows:


          "The appellant has grown up in Birmingham.  He has  been  here  in
          the UK lawfully since the age of 10, 25  years  ago.   He  has  no
          family life in Bangladesh.  He had visited there once in 2007  but
          that was to visit his father's grave.  He  had  no  ties,  family,
          cultural or social, now to Bangladesh.   The  appellant  had  been
          taking drug and alcohol courses and was being helped and receiving
          support.   It  would  be  disproportionate  to  remove  him.   The
          appellant has grown up here.  He is not a shady adult,  a  serious
          criminal, who should be deported in order to protect the public."

      The remainder of the submissions relates to family life.  At paragraph
      64 the Tribunal set out its conclusion on this issue:


          "We find that the appellant classically  falls  within  [paragraph
          399A].  He has lived in the UK for 25 years and the only  ties  in
          evidence that we heard that the appellant had were with his former
          in-laws whom he visited in 2007 when  the  relationship  with  his
          wife, as far as they were concerned, was probably continuing.   We
          do not think it likely that he would have a relationship with  his
          former in-laws now after this separation or even  divorce.   There
          is no other family there.  The appellant came  here  aged  10  and
          hardly speaks Bengali and has really no social, cultural or family
          connections with Bangladesh at all."


  19.  Judge Ford, as I have indicated,  began  consideration  of  paragraph
      399A from a different point of view, because she  had  concluded  that
      the applicant was prepared to mislead  the  Tribunal  in  relation  to
      matters affecting his family  life.   But  at  the  beginning  of  her
      determination she set out both  a  reference  to  Devaseelan  and  the
      relevant parts of the 2012 determination.  In particular, at paragraph
      [22], Judge Ford summarised paragraph 64 of  the  2012  determination.
      In relation to links with Bangladesh, however, Judge Ford said this:


       "76. The appellant is in good health.  I accept  that  he  completed
           his education in  the  United  Kingdom  and  that  he  has  work
           experience in the UK.  I take  on  board  the  findings  of  the
           Tribunal in October 2012 that the  appellant  has  no  remaining
           ties to Bangladesh.  However, I had additional evidence that did
           not appear to be considered by that Tribunal.   I  had  evidence
           that he had visited Bangladesh for five  weeks  in  97/98,  five
           weeks in January 2001, just over five months in  2005  and  four
           months in 2007.


        77. The Appellant has acknowledged that he speaks some Bengali.   I
           do not accept that he spoke English  throughout  his  visits  to
           Bangladesh and I am satisfied that he could quickly improve  his
           language skills in Bangladesh so that he could cope with  living
           there.  I do not accept that he has cut all language  ties  with
           Bangladesh.  Nor do I accept that  he  has  cut  all  social  or
           cultural ties to Bangladesh given the length of  some  of  these
           visits, particularly the visits in 2005 and 2007.


        78. The Appellant has employment experience in the  United  Kingdom
           and has some limited qualifications in catering.  I am satisfied
           that he could secure employment sufficient to sustain himself in
           Bangladesh in the catering trade.   Whilst  I  accept  that  his
           experience as a chef has been  in  Indian  cooking  and  not  in
           Bengali cooking, he has experience as a waiter and  could  avail
           of  the  facilitated  voluntary  return  scheme  to  return   to
           Bangladesh and improve his skills so that he  could  work  as  a
           chef there.


        79. Whilst I recognise the length of time the Appellant  has  spent
           in the UK and that he regards himself as  British,  contrary  to
           the Tribunal's findings in October 2012 that he has severed  all
           ties to Bangladesh, I am satisfied that he has  extended  family
           members there and an  ability  to  quickly  integrate  into  the
           society so that he can lead a full life there provided he steers
           clear of drugs and alcohol."


  20. Judge Ford's view was therefore that the applicant did not fall within
      paragraph 399A.  His appeal was therefore dismissed.


   Mr Nicholson's submissions


  21. Mr Nicholson's argument is as follows.  Contrary to  what  Judge  Ford
      said in the passage just extracted, the relevant evidence  before  her
      was the same as that before the  Tribunal  in  2012,  particularly  in
      relation to the number of  visits  to  Bangladesh  and  their  length.
      Applying the Devaseelan principles,  therefore,  Judge  Ford  was  not
      entitled to depart from the conclusion of  the  Tribunal  in  2012  on
      links with Bangladesh: she should have declined to allow the matter to
      be relitigated.  Although Judge Ford's decision was not the subject of
      any suggestion that it contained a legal error, the Secretary of State
      was obliged by Devaseelan to rely on the first determination, that  is
      to say the determination of the Tribunal in 2012, to take  it  as  the
      starting point for her decision, and not to depart from the issues  it
      had decided unless there  was  good  reason  to  do  so,  for  example
      evidence post-dating that determination.


  22. In Mr Nicholson's submission, therefore, the deportation  order  could
      not stand.  So far from being liable to deportation, the applicant was
      entitled to recognition as a person who fell  within  paragraph  399A,
      and therefore to a grant of leave in accordance with paragraph 399B.


   Decision


  23. I reject Mr Nicholson's submissions,  for  a  number  of  interlocking
      reasons.


  24. It is convenient to start  with  the  most  obvious.   The  Devaseelan
      guidelines are addressed to Judges, not to  the  Secretary  of  State.
      The starting point of the Devaseelan guidelines is  that  the  earlier
      judicial determination is not binding on  the  judge  determining  the
      second appeal (although  it  will  probably  need  to  be  taken  into
      account).  The point at which the guidelines have  effect  is  when  a
      judge is about to take the second judicial decision.  By contrast, the
      Secretary of State never takes  any  judicial  decision,  and  is  not
      merely guided but essentially bound by the previous judicial decision.
       The Secretary of State's obligations in relation to a matter that has
      already been the subject  of  a  judicial  decision  derive  not  from
      guidelines found in Devaseelan but obligations found in  the  line  of
      cases beginning in Mersin, to which I have referred  earlier  in  this
      judgment.


  25. Secondly, and quite separately, there is  nothing  in  the  Devaseelan
      guidelines that specifically deals with  the  case  where  there  have
      already been two judicial decisions,  reaching  opposite  conclusions.
      In the context of the guidance being given, Devaseelan says  that  the
      "first" decision must be the starting point; but that is  because  the
      context is that the guidance is being given to  the  second  decision-
      maker.  There is no reason at  all  to  suppose  that,  if  there  are
      already two judicial decisions, the person  making  a  third  decision
      should treat the first (older) decision rather than the second (newer)
      decision as his starting-point.


  26. Thirdly, precisely because the Devaseelan guidelines are guidelines to
      judges and not to the Secretary of  State,  this  is  clearly  a  case
      where, on Mr Nicholson's submissions, the applicant had an alternative
      remedy  available  to  him.   If  he  considered  that  Judge   Ford's
      conclusions were not reached lawfully, he could have sought permission
      to appeal against her determination.  No such  application  was  made.
      It is difficult to see any good reason why  a  recent  appealable  but
      unappealed determination should not be regarded as authoritative;  and
      the  availability  of  that  mode  of  challenge   to   Judge   Ford's
      determination would be sufficient of itself to prevent  the  applicant
      having the remedy he seeks by way of judicial review.  As Ms  Anderson
      points out, the result contended for by Mr Nicholson would mean that a
      party who  does  not  seek  to  challenge  a  later  adverse  judicial
      determination can, in effect, seek to have it ignored because he would
      prefer to rely on the earlier determination.  The rule  that  judicial
      review is a remedy of last resort avoids the  peculiarity  of  such  a
      result.


  27. The applicant's challenge to the deportation  order  therefore  fails.
      But in view of the persistent  way  in  which  Mr  Nicholson  put  his
      submissions, I  have  considered  whether  there  is  any  perceptible
      injustice to the applicant arising out of the events canvassed in  his
      submissions.


  28. Other things being equal, the applicant might have expected  the  2012
      determination to result in a grant of leave under paragraph 399B.   As
      I have said, however, the Tribunal at that time made it clear that  it
      thought that further offences  might  well  lead  to  the  applicant's
      deportation.  The applicant committed a  number  of  further  offences
      very soon after that decision.  It does not look  as  though  carrying
      out  the  2012  Tribunal's  decision  could  be  regarded  as  leading
      automatically to a grant of leave in the events  which  happened.   By
      the time of the second appeal there had been those  further  offences.
      Supposing Judge Ford's determination had been the subject of an appeal
      based on the Devaseelan guidelines, it would have to have been  argued
      that, in relation to ties to Bangladesh, the matter  was  dealt  with,
      effectively finally, by the 2012 determination.  That, certainly,  was
      the way Mr Nicholson argued the matter before me.  It is true  to  say
      that the 2012 Tribunal reached a clear conclusion on that  issue,  and
      it is clear also that it reached the  conclusion  rather  unwillingly.
      It may further be properly  surmised  that  the  applicant's  ties  to
      Bangladesh in 2014 would be likely, in his  circumstances,  to  be  no
      closer than they were in 2012.  It appears also to be  true  that  the
      evidence, in particular in relation to visits, that was  before  Judge
      Ford, was the same evidence that had been before the 2012 Tribunal.


  29. There are, however, in my judgement, two clear differences.  The first
      is that Judge Ford had reached the conclusion I have set out, that the
      applicant was not telling the truth about  his  family  relationships.
      Certainly Judge Ford was entitled to look at the relationships at  the
      date  of  the  2014  hearing,  and  to  reach  conclusions  about  the
      credibility of the evidence.  The relationships  were,  however,  also
      canvassed in 2012, and it seems to me that Judge Ford was entitled  to
      bring a different attitude to the question of links  with  Bangladesh,
      based on any revised view about whether the applicant's  evidence  was
      reliable or whether he was trying to mislead the Tribunal.


  30.  Secondly,  although  with  some  difficulty,  using  barely   legible
      photocopies, Mr Nicholson was indeed able to show me that the evidence
      of all the visits to Bangladesh had been before the Tribunal in  2012,
      as I have pointed out,  his  own  summary  of  the  evidence  to  that
      Tribunal was that there had been only one visit, in  2007.   That,  at
      any event, is what the Tribunal recorded as his submission.    In  the
      circumstances, it can hardly be regarded as surprising that Judge Ford
      considered that there was now "additional evidence that did not appear
      to be considered by that Tribunal" that is to say, evidence  of  other
      visits, including one very long one in 2005.  The applicant  has  been
      represented throughout by the same solicitors.  I have  not  seen  any
      suggestion that Judge Ford was told that evidence of  all  the  visits
      was before the 2012 Tribunal and that Mr Nicholson's  submission  that
      there had been only one  visit  was  either  incorrectly  recorded  or
      factually incorrect.  It is clear that  the  2012  Tribunal  makes  no
      reference to any other visits, and the most likely reason for that  is
      that they were relying on a submission made to  them  that  there  had
      been only one visit.


  31. Be that as it may, the position as it seems to me is that an appeal on
      Devaseelan grounds against Judge Ford's determination would have  been
      unlikely to succeed but  there  was  no  such  appeal.   Judge  Ford's
      determination stands.  Neither Devaseelan nor any other  principle  of
      law identified on the applicant's behalf prevented  the  Secretary  of
      State from  relying  on  that  determination  and  proceeding  to  the
      applicant's deportation.
