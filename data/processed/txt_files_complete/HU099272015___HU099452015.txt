Advice


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1. The respondents (hereinafter "the claimants") are nationals of Nepal who
   applied for entry clearance to settle in the UK as dependent sons of
   their father, a former Gurkha soldier who is present and settled in the
   UK. The applications were refused by the Secretary of State. The
   claimants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal where their appeal was
   heard by Judge Amin. By a decision promulgated on 9 February 2017, the
   judge allowed the appeal. This decision of the First-tier Tribunal is now
   being appealed by the Secretary of State.

Background

2. The first claimant was born on 22 July 1987. The second claimant was
   born on 29 August 1989. They reside together in Nepal.


3. The claimants' father ("the Sponsor") is a former Gurkha soldier who
   joined the army in 1979 and was discharged in 1993. He was granted
   indefinite leave to enter the UK in 2009. He applied to bring the
   claimants with him but this application was refused.


4. The Sponsor claims that if he had been allowed to settle in the UK on
   discharge from the army he would have done so with his sons (who were
   young children at the time).


5. The Sponsor entered the UK in February 2011 whereupon a further
   application was made in order to enable the claimants to join him in the
   UK. This was refused in May 2012 and the appeal of that the decision was
   dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Martins) in April 2013
   (hereinafter "the 2013 decision").


6. The Sponsor and the mother of the claimants are divorced. The claimants
   claim that they do not have regular contact with their mother and that
   she does not provide them with any support.  They claim to be unemployed
   and that the circumstances in Nepal are such that they are unable to find
   work. They also claim that their family in Nepal is extremely poor and
   unable to provide them with any support. The Sponsor provides the
   claimants with �400-�500 a month and they claim to be totally financially
   dependent on him.


7. The Sponsor works as a taxi driver in the UK, earning between �2,000 and
   �3,000 a month. He last visited Nepal in 2013. His reason for not
   visiting since is that he has been saving money to enable him to sponsor
   the claimants. The Sponsor and the claimants claim that they speak
   several times a week.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal


8. The judge considered whether Article 8(1) ECHR was engaged. Citing the
   Upper Tribunal decision in Dasgupta [2016] UKUT 00028, the judge noted
   that the question of whether family life exists is intensely fact
   sensitive. She found the claimants are financially dependent on the
   Sponsor, had lived with the Sponsor until he departed to the UK, are
   dependent on the Sponsor for their accommodation in Nepal, are
   emotionally close to the Sponsor, and do not receive similar support from
   other family, in particular their mother. The judge concluded that
   Article 8 was engaged in these particular circumstances.


9. The judge recognised that in 2013 the First-tier Tribunal reached a
   different conclusion as to whether article 8 was engaged. The judge noted
   at paragraph 15 that when the appeal was considered in 2013 the claimants
   still interacted with their mother. At paragraph 29 the judge explained
   that she was departing from the 2013 decision because since then the
   claimants had lost all contact with their mother. The judge also stated
   that there have been developments in the case law.


10. The judge found that but for the historic injustice that prevented the
   Sponsor settling in the UK following his discharge from the army in 1993,
   the claimants, who at that time were minors, would have settled in the UK
   with their father. The judge noted the finding in Ghising [2013] UKUT 567
   that "the weight to be given to the historic injustice will normally
   require a decision in the appellant's favour".

11. At paragraph 22 the judge stated:


    "Nothing in Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002 which states, inter alia, that the Tribunal must have regard to
    whether the appellant speaks English and whether she is financially
    independent add anything in this context."

Grounds of Appeal and Submissions


  12. The Secretary of State has made two arguments in the grounds of
      appeal.


  13. The first argument is that the judge failed to take into consideration
      that the claimants are not financially independent which she was
      required to do under Section 117B(3) of the Nationality, Immigration
      and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act").


  14. The second argument in the grounds is that the judge failed to
      adequately justify the finding that there is family life between the
      claimants and the Sponsor, given the different conclusion reached in
      the 2013 decision and that she had "merely" found the claimants to be
      receiving financial assistance from the Sponsor and to have lost
      contact with their mother.

Consideration

  15. The issue raised by the second ground of appeal - whether family life
      exists between adult children and a parent - is one that has been
      subject to considerable analysis by the Court of Appeal. See for
      example Singh v Secretary of State [2015] EWCA Civ 630 and Rai v Entry
      Clearance Officer [2017] EWCA Civ 320. The recent case law makes clear
      that there is no legal or factual presumption as to the existence or
      absence of family life for the purposes of Article 8 and the
      assessment of whether there is family life is fact specific and will
      depend on consideration of all the relevant facts in the particular
      case.


  16. In the present case, the judge has undertaken a fact specific
      evaluation of the circumstances of the claimants and the Sponsor. Her
      unchallenged findings were that the claimants are financially
      dependent on the Sponsor who pays for their accommodation and that
      they have no contact with their mother. She also found that but for
      the historic injustice affecting Gurkhas the sponsor would have been
      able to bring, and would have brought, the claimants to the UK when
      they were children. That this is relevant to an assessment under
      Article 8(1) was made clear in Rai (see paragraphs 41-42). Given this
      factual matrix, it was in my view unsurprising the judge would
      conclude family life existed within the meaning of Article 8(1).


  17. Before me, Ms Isherwood argued that the judge ought to have followed
      the 2013 decision where family life under Article 8 had been found to
      not be engaged as there had been no change in circumstances in the
      intervening period. Mr Lee contended that matters had in fact moved
      on, both in terms of the factual circumstances and the case law
      pertaining to the issue of whether Article 8 is engaged. He noted that
      the 2013 decision was promulgated before Ghissing (Gurkhas/BOCs;
      historic wrong; weight) [2013] UKUT 00567 and Rai.


  18. Applying the Devaseelan guidelines on procedure in second appeals
      (Devaseelan v SSHD [2002] UKAIT 702), the correct approach was for the
      judge to treat the 2013 decision as a starting point - and  an
      authoritative assessment of the claimant's status when it was made -
      which could then be built upon by consideration of the facts arising
      subsequently. In my view, this is exactly the approach taken by the
      judge. She has treated the 2013 decision as her starting point and has
      noted that since that time there has been a change in the factual
      circumstances, which is that the claimants have now lost contact with
      their mother completely. This is a material change in the claimants'
      circumstances and I am satisfied that the judge was entitled to depart
      from the 2013 decision because of it. I therefore find that the
      Secretary of State is unable to succeed under the second ground of
      appeal.


  19. I now turn to the first ground of appeal, which argues that the judge
      failed to properly consider Section 117B of the 2002 Act.


  20. In the assessment of proportionality under Article 8 ECHR in a case
      not involving deportation a court or tribunal must have regard to the
      factors set out in Section 117B of the 2002 Act. Accordingly, the
      judge did not have an option as to whether or not to consider whether
      the claimants speak English, were financially independent or satisfied
      any of the other factors in Section 117B.


  21. The judge considered Section 117B at paragraph 22. In this paragraph,
      it is unclear whether the judge was saying that she was not taking
      Section 117B into account (which would be an error of law) or that she
      has taken the Section into account but that it did not change her
      conclusion about the public interest (which would not be an error of
      law). However, even if the judge has made an error of law, the error
      is not material.


  22. This is a case where the judge has made an unchallenged finding that
      but for the Sponsor's inability to settle in the UK at the date of
      discharge (when the claimants were young children), the claimants
      would have settled in the UK many years ago. In such circumstances,
      the "historic injustice" will carry significant weight in the
      balancing exercise under Article 8 (2) and it will ordinarily outweigh
      the public interest in firm immigration control. As explained in
      Ghissing:

         "....there may be cases where Appellants in Gurkha cases  will  not
         succeed, even though their family life engages Article 8(1) and the
         evidence shows they would have come  to  the  United  Kingdom  with
         their father, but for the injustice that prevented the latter  from
         settling here  on  completion  of  his  military  service.  If  the
         Respondent can point to matters over and above the "public interest
         in maintaining of a firm immigration policy", which argue in favour
         of removal or the refusal of leave to enter, these  must  be  given
         appropriate weight in the balance in the Respondent's favour. Thus,
         a bad immigration history and/or criminal behaviour  may  still  be
         sufficient  to  outweigh  the  powerful  factors  bearing  on   the
         Appellant's side. Being an adult child of a UK settled  Gurkha  ex-
         serviceman is, therefore, not a "trump card", in the sense that not
         every application by such a person will inevitably succeed. But, if
         the Respondent is relying only upon the public  interest  described
         by the Court of Appeal at paragraph 41 of Gurung, then  the  weight
         to be given to the  historic  injustice  will  normally  require  a
         decision in the Appellant's favour.


  23. Whilst the fact that the claimants are not financially independent is
      a factor that must be taken into account in the proportionality
      assessment under Article 8(2), it would be inconsistent with Ghissing
      to find that this factor, of itself, could outweigh the "powerful
      factors bearing on the [claimants'] side". There is nothing in the
      factual matrix to suggest the claimants have a poor immigration
      history, have engaged in criminal behaviour, or have done something
      analogous. Having found Article 8(1) was engaged, it is difficult to
      see how on the facts of this case the judge could have reached a
      conclusion other than in the claimants' favour.


Decision


A. The appeal is dismissed.

B. The judge has not made a material error of law and the decision of the
First-tier Tribunal stands.
