(1)  In assessing the credibility of an asylum claim,  the  benefit  of  the
doubt ("TBOD"), as discussed in paragraphs 203 and 204  of  the  1979  UNHCR
Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status,  is  not
to be regarded as a rule of law. It is a  general  guideline,  expressed  in
the Handbook in defeasible and contingent terms.

(2)  Although the Handbook confines TBOD to the end point of  a  credibility
assessment ("After the applicant has made a genuine effort  to  substantiate
his story": paragraph 203), TBOD is not, in fact, so limited. Its  potential
to be used at earlier stages is not, however, to be understood as  requiring
TBOD to be given to each and every item of evidence, in isolation.  What  is
involved is simply no more than an  acceptance  that  in  respect  of  every
asserted fact when there is  doubt,  the  lower  standard  entails  that  it
should not be rejected and should rather continue to be kept in  mind  as  a
possibility at least until the end when the question of  risk  is  posed  in
relation to the evidence in the round.

(3)  Correctly viewed, therefore, TBOD adds  nothing  of  substance  to  the
lower standard of proof, which as  construed  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
Karanakaran v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2000]  3  All  ER
449, affords a "positive role for uncertainty".

(4) The proposition in paragraph 219 of the Handbook,  that  when  assessing
the evidence of minors there may need to be a "liberal  application  of  the
benefit of the doubt" is also not to be  regarded  as  a  rule  of  law  or,
indeed, a statement of universal application. As a reminder about  what  the
examiner should  bear  in  mind  at  the  end  point  of  an  assessment  of
credibility,  the  proposition  adds  nothing  of  substance  to  the  lower
standard of  proof.  If,  for  example,  an  applicant  possesses  the  same
maturity as an adult, it may not be  appropriate  to  resort  to  a  liberal
application of TBOD.

(5)  Article 4(5) of the Qualification Directive is confined to setting  out
the conditions under which there  will  be  no  need  for  corroboration  or
"confirmation" of evidence. Although  (unlike  the  Handbook)  Article  4(5)
does set out conditions that are rules of law, properly read, it is  not  to
be compared with the scope of TBOD as described above.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This appeal raises two issues:  the  general  issue  of  whether  in  the
assessment of credibility  the  benefit  of  the  doubt  (hereafter  "TBOD")
should be a guiding principle; and the more  specific  issue  of  whether  a
tribunal judge errs in law if he fails when assessing the credibility  of  a
minor to give to that  person's  evidence  a  "liberal  application  of  the
benefit of the doubt".

2. TBOD is a commonly invoked rule in asylum law.[1]   Its  locus  classicus
is to be found in paragraphs 203-204 of the 1979 UNHCR Handbook, wherein  it
is seen as a rule that it is "frequently necessary" to apply when  assessing
the credibility of an asylum claim.  It  is  referred  to  in  some  of  the
literature (and was referred to by us in case management  directions)  as  a
"principle" but  for  reasons  which  will  become  apparent  we  think,  on
reflection, that to call it a "principle" or even a "rule" risks  confusion;
we prefer, depending on the context, to refer to  it  by  the  more  neutral
term "notion". Paragraphs 203-204 provide:

    "203. After the applicant has made a genuine effort to substantiate his
    story there may still be a lack of evidence for some of his statements.
     As explained above (paragraph 196) it is hardly possible for a refugee
    to 'prove' every  part  of  his  case  and,  indeed,  if  this  were  a
    requirement the majority of refugees would not be  recognised.   It  is
    therefore frequently necessary to give the applicant the benefit of the
    doubt.


    204. The benefit of the doubt should, however, only be given  when  all
    available evidence has been obtained and checked and when the  examiner
    is  satisfied  as  to  the  applicant's   general   credibility.    The
    applicant's statements must be coherent and plausible, and must not run
    counter to generally known facts."


3. The notion is also seen by the Handbook as  one  that  needs  a  "liberal
application" when  assessing  the  credibility  of  asylum  claims  made  by
minors. Paragraphs 213-219 state:

    "213.There is no special provision in the 1951 Convention  relating  to
    the refugee status of persons under age.   The  same  definition  of  a
    refugee applies to all individuals, regardless of their age.   When  it
    is necessary to determine the refugee status  of  minor,  problems  may
    arise due to the difficulty of applying the criteria  of  'well-founded
    fear' in his case.  If a minor is accompanied by one (or both)  of  his
    parents, or another family member on whom he is dependent, who requests
    refugee status, the minor's  own  refugee  status  will  be  determined
    according to the principle of  family  unity  (paragraphs  181  to  188
    above).


    214. The question of whether an unaccompanied  minor  may  qualify  for
    refugee status must be determined in the first  instance  according  to
    the degree of his mental development and  maturity.   In  the  case  of
    children, it will generally be  necessary  to  enrol  the  services  of
    experts conversant with child  mentality.   A  child  -  and  for  that
    matter, an adolescent  -  not  being  legally  independent  should,  if
    appropriate, have a guardian  appointed  whose  task  it  would  be  to
    promote a decision that will be in the minor's best interests.  In  the
    absence of parents or of a legally appointed guardian, it  is  for  the
    authorities to ensure that the interests of an  applicant  for  refugee
    status who is a minor are fully safeguarded.


    215. Where a minor is no longer a child but an adolescent, it  will  be
    easier to determine refugee status as in the case of an adult, although
    this again will depend upon  the  actual  degree  of  the  adolescent's
    maturity.  It can be assumed that - in the absence  of  indications  to
    the contrary - a person of 16 or over may be regarded  as  sufficiently
    mature to have a well-founded fear of  persecution.   Minors  under  16
    years of age may normally be assumed not  to  be  sufficiently  mature.
    They may have fear and a will of their own, but these may not have  the
    same significance as in the case of an adult.


    216.It should,  however,  be  stressed  that  these  are  only  general
    guidelines  and  that  a  minor's  mental  maturity  must  normally  be
    determined  in  the  light  of  his  personal,  family   and   cultural
    background.


    217. Where the minor has not reached a sufficient degree of maturity to
    make it possible to establish well-founded fear in the same way as  for
    an adult, it may  be  necessary  to  have  greater  regard  to  certain
    objective factors.  Thus, if an unaccompanied minor  finds  himself  in
    the company of a group  of  refugees,  this  may  -  depending  on  the
    circumstances, indicate that the minor is also a refugee.


    218. The  circumstances  of  the  parents  and  other  family  members,
    including their situation in the minor's country of origin,  will  have
    to be taken into account.  If there  is  reason  to  believe  that  the
    parents wish their child to be outside the country of origin on grounds
    of well-founded fear of persecution, the child himself may be  presumed
    to have such fear.


    219. If the will of the parents cannot be ascertained or if  such  will
    is in doubt or in conflict  with  the  will  of  the  child,  then  the
    examiner, in cooperation with the experts assisting him, will  have  to
    come to a decision as to the well-foundedness of the  minor's  fear  on
    the basis of the known circumstances, which  may  call  for  a  liberal
    application of the benefit of the doubt."


4. What is said about minors in these paragraphs has  been  supplemented  by
the UNHCR Refugee Children Guidelines on Protection and Care, 1994 which  at
page 101 state that:


    "(e)  The  problem  of  'proof'  is  great  in  every  refugee   status
         determination.  It is compounded in the case of children.  For this
         reason, the decision on  a  child's  refugee  status  calls  for  a
         liberal application of the principle of the benefit of  the  doubt.
         This means that should  there  be  some  hesitation  regarding  the
         credibility of the child's story, the burden is not on the child to
         provide proof, but the child should be given  the  benefit  of  the
         doubt."


5. They have been further supplemented in 2009 by the  UNHCR  Guidelines  on
International Protection No. 8: Child Asylum  Claims  under  Articles  1A(2)
and 1(F) of the 2951 Convention and/or 1967 Protocol relating to the  Status
of Refugees, which provide that:


    "[65]    Due to their young age, dependency  and  relative  immaturity,
         children  should  enjoy  specific   procedural   and   evidentiary
         safeguards  to  ensure  that  fair  refugee  status  determination
         decisions are reached with respect to their claims.   The  general
         measures  outlined  below  set  out  minimum  standards  for   the
         treatment of children during the asylum procedure.   They  do  not
         preclude the application of the detailed  guidance  provided,  for
         example, in the Action for the Rights of Children Resources  Pack,
         the Inter-Agency Guiding Principles on Unaccompanied and Separated
         Children and in national guidelines.

    [68] For unaccompanied and separated child applicants, efforts need  to
         be made as  soon  as  possible  to  initiate  tracing  and  family
         reunification with parents or other family members.  There will be
         exceptions, however, to these priorities where information becomes
         available suggesting that tracing or reunification could  put  the
         parents or other family members in danger, that the child has been
         subjected to abuse or neglect,  and/or  where  parents  or  family
         members  may  be  implicated  or  have  been  involved  in   their
         persecution.


    [73] Although the  burden  of  proof  usually  is  shared  between  the
         examiner and the applicant in adult claims, it  may  be  necessary
         for an examiner to assume a greater burden of proof in  children's
         claims, especially if the child concerned  is  unaccompanied.   If
         the facts of the case cannot be ascertained and/or  the  child  is
         incapable of fully articulating his/her claim, the examiner  needs
         to make a decision on the basis of all known circumstances,  which
         may call for a liberal application of the benefit  of  the  doubt.
         Similarly, the child should be given  the  benefit  of  the  doubt
         should there be some concern regarding the credibility of parts of
         his/her claim."


6. Given the widespread approval by courts and tribunals  worldwide  of  the
1979 Handbook as a source of  guidance  on  asylum  law  issues,  one  would
expect to find  plentiful  use  by  them  of  TBOD  notion  as  set  out  in
paragraphs 203-204 and 213-219. There  are  some  high-profile  cases  where
reliance is placed on it: see e.g. in Canada, in  Chan  v  Canada  (Minister
of Employment and Immigration [1995] 3 S.C.R. 593; in the US, in  Matter  of
S-M-J, 21 I & N. Dec 722, 725 (B.I.A. 1997); in the  Czech  Republic  in  SN
(Belarus) Ministry of Interior, (2005) 6 Azs  235/2004-57  Cz.Sup.Admin.Ct.,
Dec 21, 2005. (We shall deal with the  position  in  the  UK  below  but  it
suffices to say here that  there  have  not  been  any  high  profile  cases
directly engaging with the notion).

7.  Although  concerned  not  with  the  Refugee  Convention  but  with  the
prohibition of ill-treatment in its non-refoulement context to be  found  in
the ECHR, the European Court of Human Rights has invoked the notion in  many
cases.  Thus in R.C. v Sweden, App. No. 41827/07, 9 March  2010,  the  Court
stated at [50]:

     "The Court acknowledges that, owing to the special situation in which
    asylum seekers often find themselves, it  is  frequently  necessary  to
    give them the benefit of the doubt  when  it  comes  to  assessing  the
    credibility of their statements and the documents submitted in  support
    thereof. However, when information  is  presented  which  gives  strong
    reasons to question the veracity of an asylum seeker's submissions, the
    individual must provide a  satisfactory  explanation  for  the  alleged
    discrepancies (see, among other authorities, Collins and  Akasiebie  v.
    Sweden  (dec.),  no. 23944/05,  8 March 2007,  and  Matsiukhina  and
    Matsiukhin v. Sweden (dec.), no. 31260/04, 21 June 2005). In principle,
    the applicant has to adduce evidence capable of proving that there  are
    substantial grounds for believing that, if the  measure  complained  of
    were to be implemented, he would be exposed to a  real  risk  of  being
    subjected to treatment contrary  to  Article  3  (see  N.  v.  Finland,
    no. 38885/02, � 167, 26 July 2005 and NA. v. the United Kingdom,  no.
    25904/07, � 111, 17 July 2008). Where such evidence is adduced,  it  is
    for the Government to dispel any doubts about it." (see also SHH  v  UK
    [2013] 57 EHRR 18."

8. In I v Sweden  App.  no.  61204/09  at  [60]  the  Court  drew  upon  its
reasoning in R.C. v Sweden as follows:

    "The Government have questioned the applicants' credibility and pointed
    to various inconsistencies in their stories. The Court accepts that, as
    a general principle, the national authorities are best placed to assess
    not just the facts but, more particularly, the credibility of witnesses
    since it is they who have had an opportunity to see,  hear  and  assess
    the demeanour of the individuals concerned (see  R.C.  v.  Sweden,  no.
    41827/07, � 52, 9 March 2010). But at the  same  time  it  acknowledges
    that owing to the special situation in which asylum seekers often  find
    themselves, it is frequently necessary to give them the benefit of  the
    doubt when it comes to assessing the credibility  of  their  statements
    and  the  documents  submitted  in  support  thereof.   However,   when
    information is presented which gives strong  reasons  to  question  the
    veracity of an asylum seeker's submissions, the individual must provide
    a satisfactory explanation for the alleged  discrepancies  (see,  among
    other authorities, N. v. Sweden, no. 23505/09, � 53, 20 July 2010 )."

9. Yet at least if academic studies are a guide,  cases  decided  under  the
Refugee Convention utilising the notion  are  surprisingly  few  in  number.
And, as epitomised by the Chan case, there  has  not  always  been  judicial
consensus about its scope or precise utility. At [142] of Chan, Major J  for
the majority stated that:

              "My colleague, La Forest J. argues that no conclusions can  be
      drawn from individual items of evidence and that  on  each  item  the
      appellant should  be  given  the  benefit  of  the  doubt,  often  by
      considering hypotheticals which could support the appellant's  claim.
      This approach handicaps a refugee determination Board from performing
      its task of drawing  reasonable  conclusions  on  the  basis  of  the
      evidence which is presented.  This  approach  is  also  fundamentally
      incompatible with the concept of "benefit of  the  doubt"  as  it  is
      expounded in the UNHCR Handbook:

                '204. The benefit of the doubt  should,  however,  only  be
            given when all available evidence has been obtained and  checked
            and when the examiner is satisfied as to the applicant's general
            credibility.  The applicant's statements must  be  coherent  and
            plausible, and must not run counter to  generally  known  facts.
            [Emphasis added.]'".


 10. Earlier at [56] La Forest J had stated that:


       "The appellant's account of  events  so  closely  mirrors  the  known
      facts concerning the implementation of China's population policy that,
      given the absence of any negative finding as to the credibility of the
      appellant or of  his  evidence,  I  think  it  clear  that  his  quite
      plausible account is entitled to the benefit of  any  doubt  that  may
      exist.  With respect, I see no merit in the  approach  taken  by  some
      members of the court below and by my colleague Major J. to seize  upon
      sections of the appellant's testimony in isolation.   Indeed,  I  find
      such a technique antithetical to the guidelines of the UNHCR  Handbook
      (see paragraph 201)."

11.  James Hathaway and Michelle Foster, The Law of Refugee  Status,  C.U.P.
2014 construe the notion as an aspect of the lower standard of proof and  in
that context question whether it adds anything of substance:

    "While it is sometimes said  that  the  claimant  is  entitled  to  the
    "benefit of the doubt" if there is an insufficiency of  evidence,  this
    principle in substance adds little to the intentionally  low  threshold
    of the test of well-founded fear.  That  is,  because  the  applicant's
    responsibility is only to show that there is a  real  chance  of  being
    persecuted, this standard already accounts for the possibility of "lack
    of evidence for some of [the applicant's]  statements" [UNHCR Handbook.
    para 203] said to justify the application of the "benefit of the doubt"
    rule. Coupled with the shared duty of  fact-finding  and  the  ultimate
    responsibility of the decision-maker to recognise refugee  status  when
    warranted on the merits however the  claim  may  have  been  framed  or
    argued] , it is doubtful that there is much that a super-added "benefit
    of the doubt" principle could, or should, add."( pp.120-121).


12. In the context of assessment of credibility, some academic studies  have
highlighted the lack of consistency in state practice over the  relationship
between TBOD and the burden and standard  of  proof:  see  e.g.  J  Sweeney,
"Credibility, Proof and Refugee Law" (2009) 21 1JRL 700, 707.

13. The research findings of UNHCR in  its  May  2013  CREDO  study,  Beyond
Proof: Credibility Assessment in EU Asylum Systems,  in  the  context  of  a
survey of several EU countries, were that:

    "Some decision-makers may lack a clear understanding of the purpose and
    relevance of the principle of the benefit of the doubt,  in  particular
    with regard to:


        . The asserted facts in relation to  which  the  principle  of  the
          benefit of the doubt is considered;


        . The point at which a consideration of the benefit of the doubt is
          undertaken;

        . The criteria and considerations taken into account in determining
          whether to grant the benefit of the doubt." (pp.229-230).

14. In seeking to improve understanding, UNHCR's conclusion  in  this  study
(at pp.246-7) was that TBOD should only come into play at the end  point  of
the credibility assessment, after the decision-maker has  sought  to  accept
or reject what asserted facts he can:

    "Following such assessment, there may nevertheless  be  an  element  of
    doubt in the mind of the decision-maker about the credibility  of  some
    asserted relevant facts.  It is in relation to such facts, and  at  the
    end  of  the  credibility  assessment,   that   UNHCR   suggests   that
    consideration must be given, in a separate step, to whether  to  afford
    the benefit of the doubt."

The EU Qualification Directive 2004/83/EC (QD)

15. Within the EU matters have been further complicated  by  the  fact  that
the EU Qualification Directive (QD), whilst not making reference to TBOD  as
such, sets out in Article 4(5)  a  number  of  safeguards  relating  to  the
assessment of evidence:

    "5.  Where Member States apply the principle according to which  it  is
         the duty of the  applicant  to  substantiate  the  application  for
         international protection  and  where  aspects  of  the  applicant's
         statements are not supported  by  documentary  or  other  evidence,
         those aspects shall  not  need  confirmation,  when  the  following
         conditions are met:


         (a)  the applicant has made a genuine effort  to  substantiate  his
             application;


         (b)  all relevant elements, at the applicant's disposal, have  been
             submitted, and a satisfactory explanation regarding  any  lack
             of other relevant elements has been given;


         (c)  the applicant's  statements  are  found  to  be  coherent  and
             plausible and do not run counter  to  available  specific  and
             general information relevant to the applicant's case;


         (d)  the applicant has applied for international protection at  the
             earliest possible time, unless the applicant  can  demonstrate
             good reason for not having done so; and


         (e)   the  general  credibility   of   the   applicant   has   been
             established."


16. Opinion as to whether or to what extent the safeguards in  Article  4(5)
embody the notion of TBOD is divided. UNHCR in its CREDO study  states  that
it "encourages Member States to interpret Article 4(5) QD as  a  whole,  and
provisions (d) and (e) in particular in accordance with  the  principles  of
the UNHCR Handbook".  The  UKBA,  Asylum  Policy  Instructions,  Considering
Asylum Claims  and  Assessing  Credibility,  February  2012  (hereafter  the
APIs), state at paragraph 4.3.4 that what Article 4(5) is  saying  is  "that
if an applicant meets all five criteria, a decision-maker  should  give  the
benefit of the doubt - there would, after all, be no reason not to...".

17. On the other hand, the IARLJ CREDO study, "Assessment of Credibility  in
Refugee  and  Subsidiary  Protection  Claims  under  the  EU   Qualification
Directive: Judicial criteria and  standards",  in  C.Grutters,  E.Guild  and
S.de Groot (eds) Assessment of Credibility by Judges in Asylum Cases in  the
EU, observes at p.48 that the optional terms of Article 4(5)  have  resulted
in a co-existence of two approaches to assessment of credibility, one  under
Article 4(5) and one relying on the UNHCR principles of  "shared  duty"  and
"benefit of the doubt":

    "In Member States which consider that it is the duty of  the  claimants
    to submit all elements needed to substantiate  their  applications  (as
    expressed in Article 4.1 (first sentence), and 4.5 QD), judges who have
    residual doubts as to credibility (arising where claimant's  statements
    are not supported by documentary or other evidence), must resolve  such
    doubt by applying, at a minimum, Article 4.1 (  second  sentence),  the
    provisions of Article 4.2 -4.4, and in particular 4.5 (a)-(e).
    However, in other Member States where the  UNHCR  Handbook  [195]-[205]
    "shared duty" and "benefit of the doubt" principles (or principles of a
    like nature) are adopted domestically, judges, noting also the terms of
    Article 3 QD, should apply these principles (in  lieu  of  Article  4.1
    (first sentence), and 4.5 QD).[2]"

18. At p.50 the IARLJ study notes that "In Germany and Austria for  example,
the "benefit of the doubt" principle is a concept in criminal law only,  but
unfamiliar in  refugee  and  subsidiary  protection  law.  They  follow  the
approach of Article 4.1  and  4.5  QD."  In  order  to  straddle  these  two
approaches this IARLJ study prefers use of the concept of "residual  doubt".


The UK

19. The notion of TBOD has featured very little in UK case law dealing  with
international protection issues. The 1979 UNHCR Handbook articulation of  it
was approved in Jatikay (12658) 15 November 1995 (IAT) but there  have  been
no AIT or UTIAC cases that have engaged with  it  in  any  significant  way.
There have been a number of Court of Appeal cases referring  to  the  notion
of a liberal application of TBOD,  but  these  essentially  cite  the  UNHCR
formulation  of  this  notion,  e.g.  as  found   in   the   Guidelines   on
International Protection, 22 December 2009  without  specific  comment:  see
below para 26. The only Court of Appeal case which touches  squarely  on  it
is MD (Guinea) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA  Civ
733; we shall return to what it has to say below at paragraph 61.

20.  Despite figuring little in UK case law,  TBOD  notion  is  given  great
prominence in the aforementioned APIs, which also  see  it  as  an  integral
part of paragraph 339L of the Immigration Rules.  Paragraph  339L  specifies
that:



    "It is the duty of the person  to  substantiate  the  asylum  claim  or
    establish that he is a person eligible for humanitarian  protection  or
    substantiate his human rights claim. Where aspects of  the  applicant's
    statements are not supported by documentary or  other  evidence,  those
    aspects will not need confirmation when all of the following conditions
    are met:
    (i) the person has made a genuine effort  to  substantiate  his  asylum
    claim...;
    (ii) all material factors at the person's disposal have been submitted,
    and a satisfactory explanation regarding any lack of material has  been
    given;
    (iii) the person's statements are found to be  coherent  and  plausible
    and do not run counter to available specific  and  general  information
    relevant to the person's case;
    (iv) the person has made an asylum claim... at  the  earliest  possible
    time, unless the person can demonstrate good reason for not having done
    so; and
    (v) the general credibility of the person has been established ."


21. By way of an attempted gloss on paragraph 339L, paragraph 4.3.4. of  the
APIs states:

    "4.3.4 Benefit of the doubt and general credibility
    Facts which are internally credible but lack any external  evidence  to
    confirm them are deemed  to  be  "unsubstantiated"  or  "uncertain"  or
    "doubtful". However, a decision  must  be  made  whether  to  give  the
    applicant the benefit of the doubt on each uncertain or unsubstantiated
    fact - this means that the decision maker must come to a clear  finding
    as to whether  the  fact  can  be  accepted  or  rejected.  It  is  not
    acceptable to come to a final conclusion that  a  claimed  fact  (about
    which you are uncertain), "may have happened". The benefit of the doubt
    needs to be considered and applied  appropriately  to  these  uncertain
    facts when considering all the evidence in the round at the end of  the
    credibility assessment. This means that the benefit of  the  doubt  can
    only be considered after a finding on the material facts that are to be
    accepted or rejected has been made.


    ...
    However,  it  is  important  to  understand  paragraph  339L  and   its
    limitations. What it is saying is that if  an  applicant  meets  all  5
    criteria, a decision maker should give the benefit of the doubt - there
    would, after all be no reason not to do so. However, the reverse is not
    automatically true. Because an applicant fails to meet one or  more  of
    the criteria, this in itself  does  not  permit  a  decision  maker  to
    disregard all unsubstantiated areas of an applicant's claim because  an
    unsubstantiated statement can be credible if it is generally internally
    consistent, compatible with known facts  and  plausible.  It  is,  once
    again, a matter of determining the weight to be given to  these  issues
    in the light of the material facts of the case.


    ...


    Decision makers must ensure that wherever possible,  the  applicant  is
    given the opportunity to provide a  reasonable  explanation  where  and
    when required under the provisions of 339L. If the  applicant  has  met
    all 5 of the criteria set out in  Paragraph  339L  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, the benefit of the doubt should be given to any  unsubstantiated
    facts. If the applicant has not met all the criteria,  decision  makers
    nevertheless must consider whether giving the benefit of the  doubt  to
    any uncertain facts is justified. ...


    Any decision not to apply the  benefit  of  the  doubt  to  a  material
    claimed fact that is otherwise internally credible  must  be  based  on
    reasonably drawn, objectively justifiable, inferences. "


22. The APIs also consider that in relation to children there  should  be  a
liberal application of  the  notion.   The  respondent's  associated  Asylum
Policy Guidance (APG) contains the following principles  to  be  applied  in
the determination of a claim to asylum by a child:

    "(1) more weight must be given to objective indications of risk than to
         the child's state of mind;


    (2)  other factors to consider  might  include:  documentary  evidence,
         objective country evidence;


    (3)  a case owner must not draw  an  adverse  credibility  interference
         from omissions in the child's knowledge if it is likely that  their
         age or maturity is a factor  or  if  there  are  logical  or  other
         reasons for those omissions;


    (4)  the benefit of the doubt will need to be applied  more  generously
         when dealing with a child particularly where a child is  unable  to
         provide detail on a particular element of their claim."


23. It has been confirmed to us by the respondent  that  the  terms  of  the
Secretary of State's asylum policy guidance  as  expressed  in  [40]  of  AA
(unattached  children)  Afghanistan  CG  [2012]  UKUT  16  (IAC)  are  still
current.

24. It is to be borne in mind that in relation to minors, there  is  also  a
specific immigration Rule that appears  to  reflect  some  aspects  of  BODT
notion.  Paragraph 351 of the Immigration Rules provides that:

    "A person  of  any  age  may  qualify  for  refugee  status  under  the
    Convention and the criteria in paragraph 334  [dealing  with  Grant  of
    Asylum] applied to all cases.  However, account should be taken of  the
    applicant's maturity and in assessing the claim of a child more  weight
    should be given to objective indications of risk than  to  the  child's
    state  of  mind  and  understanding  of  his  situation.    An   asylum
    application made on behalf of the child  should  not  be  refused  only
    because the child is too young to  understand  the  situation  or  have
    formed a well-founded fear of persecution.  Close attention  should  be
    given to the welfare of the child at all times."


25. It is only right to observe that despite TBOD notion as  such  featuring
very little in UK case law, the notion of a liberal application of TBOD  was
endorsed by the (former) Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal  in  the  Guidance
Note No 8 for adjudicators and immigration judges  as  to  how  they  should
deal with appeals by unaccompanied children under  the  age  of  18  seeking
asylum. Paragraph 5 gave the following advice in relation to the  assessment
of evidence:

    "5.1 In assessing the evidence of a child, it  should  not  be  assumed
    that the child does not have a well-founded fear of persecution, merely
    because they do not have sufficient maturity to  have  formed  a  well-
    founded fear. (UNHCR Handbook on  Procedures  for  Determining  Refugee
    Status, Geneva, 1992, paragraphs 213-219).
    5.2 It should be borne in mind that the younger a child  is,  the  less
    likely they are to have full information about the reasons for  leaving
    their country of origin, or the arrangements made for their travel.
    5.3 Depending on the maturity of a child  and  the  appropriate  weight
    which can be attached to their evidence, the  emphasis  might  be  upon
    documentary and expert evidence,  rather  than  the  oral  evidence  or
    statement of the child.
    5.4 The assessment of the well-roundedness of  the  child's  fear  'may
    call for a liberal application of the  benefit  of  the  doubt'  (UNHCR
    Handbook, paragraph 219, Jatikay (12658) 15 November 1995 (IAT))."
26. This was cited without  comment  by  Dyson  LJ  in  ZJ  (Afghanistan)  v
Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] EWCA Civ 799 at [16];  see
also HK (Afghanistan) [2012] EWCA Civ 315, at [34] and  DS  (Afghanistan)  v
Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ 305 at [14].


The Appeal

27. The appellant is a national of  Afghanistan.   He  arrived  in  the  UK,
hidden in a lorry, on 18 June 2008 and had claimed asylum on  19  June  2008
at which time he claimed to be  aged  14.  By  a  determination  sent  on  8
January  2013  First-tier  Tribunal  (FtT)  Judge  Knowles   dismissed   the
appellant's appeal against the decision of the respondent on 6 May  2011  to
remove  him  from  the  United  Kingdom  after  refusing  him  international
protection or other relief under the Immigration Rules or the ECHR.

28. The basis of the appellant's claim  was  that  he  would  face  risk  on
return to  Afghanistan  both  from  the  authorities  (who  would  view  him
adversely because his father was a Hezb-i-Islami  commander  and  his  elder
brother was  also active in that organisation)  and  from  the  Taliban  and
Hezb-i-Islami also (who would seek to forcibly recruit him).  He  said  that
the incident that made him leave his home area in the  District  of  Khogani
in the Province of Nangarhar was a bomb explosion  in  2008  which  targeted
the Americans and also injured  the  district  governor.   His  family  home
having been searched on at  least  two  occasions  in  2007,  the  appellant
feared  that  following  this  explosion  his  family  would  be  considered
suspects.  The appellant said  that  before  he  left  his  home  area,  the
Taliban had approached him in  what  he  believed  was  a  prelude  to  them
forcing him to join them.

29. The appellant's screening interview took place  on  19  June  2008;  his
asylum interview took place on 10 February 2011. In support  of  his  asylum
claim, the appellant did not provide his own national identity card  but  he
produced what  he  claimed  was  his  father's  identity  card  and  also  a
photograph said to show his father with Gulbuddin Hakmatyr,  the  leader  of
Hezbi-i-Islami.  He also said that since his arrival in the UK he  had  been
in contact by phone with his mother twice.

30. In her refusal letter the  respondent  stated  that  the  appellant  had
failed  to  give  a  credible  account  either  of  his  age  or  events  in
Afghanistan.  The respondent considered the identity  card  and  photographs
unreliable.

31. The FtT  judge  who  dealt  with  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the
respondent's decision, heard evidence  from  GS  and  submissions  from  the
representatives (Mr Bazini was also the  appellant's  representative  then).
As well as a witness statement from a GS there was also one from a  RS.  The
judge also had an  expert  report  from  Dr  Giustozzi;  a  Croydon  Council
assessment report  of  3  July  2008  stating  that  two  workers  from  the
Unaccompanied Minors'  Service  has  found  that  the  appellant  was  "very
obviously" over 18; and a report  from  Dr  Michie  drawn  up  following  an
examination of the appellant on 10 November 2008, who  considered  him  then
to be 16 years old.

32. The judge decided in relation to  the  appellant's  age  to  prefer  the
assessment of Dr Michie.  The judge went  on,  however,  to  find  that  the
appellant  had  not  given  a  credible  account  of  his   experiences   in
Afghanistan or of his fears about return to that country.  Prior to  setting
out his main reasons  for  rejecting  the  appellant's  account,  the  judge
addressed the question of whether he should apply and  follow  the  guidance
contained in paragraphs 214-215 of the 1979 UNHCR Handbook which enjoin  (as
we have seen) that, in the case of  a  minor,  there  should  be  a  liberal
application of the TBOD.  The judge stated at [ 82]-[83]:


    "82.  Given this finding, I have had regard to the  guidance  contained
    in the UNHCR Handbook, Paragraph 214 of which states that the  question
    whether an unaccompanied minor may qualify for refugee status  must  be
    determined, in the first instance,  according  to  the  degree  of  his
    mental development and maturity.  Paragraph 215 advises that, where the
    minor is an adolescent, it will be easier to determine refugee  status,
    as in the case of an adult, although this will depend upon  the  actual
    degree of the adolescent's maturity.  In the absence of indications  to
    the contrary, a person of 16 or over may be  regarded  as  sufficiently
    mature to have a well-founded fear of persecution.


    83.   I  have  approached  the  record  of  the  appellant's  screening
    interview with particular caution  because  there  he  is  recorded  as
    having asked 'who is Gulbuddin?' and as having stated that he  did  not
    know why he would  be  arrested  if  returned  to  Afghanistan.   Those
    responses are, in my view, so far out of kilter with the  rest  of  the
    claim as to give rise to a possibility that,  as  an  adolescent  newly
    arrived in the UK and having  to  deal  with  officials  in  a  strange
    country unassisted, the appellant might have been  tired  and  confused
    and not done himself justice.  Beyond that, however, I can find nothing
    in the evidence before  me  to  suggest  that  the  appellant's  mental
    maturity was such that he did not understand the questions he was being
    asked during his interviews.  Indeed,  any  misunderstandings  are  put
    down to errors of interpretation.  The appellant appears to  have  been
    sufficiently independent and mature  to  have  undertaken  successfully
    what must have been an arduous 5 month journey to  the  UK.   There  is
    nothing in Dr  Michie's  report  to  suggest  that  the  appellant  was
    immature for his assessed age.  He was certainly mature enough to  give
    his solicitor a very comprehensive account of what he claims took place
    in Afghanistan and the circumstances in which he fled that country.  In
    the light of all the evidence, it is my view  that  the  appellant  was
    sufficiently mature to comprehend the nature and severity of any  risks
    in Afghanistan and to have a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution.   In
    those circumstances, I do not believe that, where issues of credibility
    arise, the appellant need necessarily be given the benefit of the doubt
    on account of his age and maturity.  I have,  nevertheless,  approached
    the evidence with caution insofar as I  believe  that  the  appellant's
    relative youth may have affected its credibility."


33. It is these paragraphs that are the principal target of the  appellant's
grounds of appeal which are essentially  twofold.   First  it  is  submitted
that in reaching the conclusion that the benefit of  the  doubt  should  not
necessarily be given to someone who was accepted as being 15 years old  when
he underwent his asylum interview the FtT judge misdirected himself in  law.
 Second, it is argued that further and in any event  the  reasons  given  by
the FtT judge for considering that he could depart from the normal  approach
that  should  be  applied  to  minor  asylum-seekers   were   "impermissibly
circular/illegal and unreasonable".  In the  latter  respect  it  is  argued
that since it was the appellant's evidence that he had been brought  to  the
UK  by  agents,  it  was  perverse  to  see  his  journey  as  evidence   of
independence  and  maturity.   It  was  also  argued  that  the  judge   had
misconstrued Dr Michie's opinion that the appellant was mature for his  age;
that simply meant he was relatively mature, not mature  in  absolute  terms.
Finally, it was contended that for the judge to treat the  comprehensiveness
of the appellant's account as evidence of  his  maturity  was  circular  and
also inconsistent because elsewhere the judge counted against the  appellant
that his account was not comprehensive.

34. The grounds  raise  several  other  points.   These,  along  with  those
outlined above, are helpfully encapsulated in [29] of the written  skeleton,
where it is said that the First-tier Tribunal judge erred in law in:

    (1)  failing to give the appellant TBOD notwithstanding acceptance that
         he was a minor when he had his asylum interview (this describes the
         essence of what is set out above);


    (2)  failing to  make  any  credibility  findings  in  respect  of  the
         witnesses called by the appellant;


    (3)  failing to have regard to the expert evidence which  suggested  in
         fact that the evidence on various points was plausible  within  the
         context of Afghanistan;


    (4)  finding that the appellant  had  suffered  no  disadvantage  as  a
         result of the SSHD's failure to trace; and


    (5)  erred in failing to apply the dicta in Singh v Belgium (33210/11),
         2 October 2012 correctly.


35. These points were amplified by Mr Bazini at the two hearings before  us.
At the hearing on 2 December 2013 Mr Bazini reiterated points  made  in  the
written grounds and also answered several questions posed by  the  Tribunal.
He said he accepted it  was  relevant  for  the  judge  to  have  considered
maturity, but  wrong of him to treat that as a basis for  disapplying  TBOD,
as that notion (which he termed  a  "principle")  applied  to  minors  as  a
class.  In the alternative, he submitted, even if  it  could  be  said  that
when Dr Mitchie and the FtT judge considered  his  age,  he  was  mature  in
absolute  (as opposed to relative)   terms,  it  remained  that  the  events
which he recounted took place when he was 13 or 14 and the judge had  simply
failed to address that problem.

36. In relation to the evidence of Dr Giustozzi, Mr Bazini  highlighted  the
failure of the  judge  to  engage  with  this  expert's  assessment  of  the
photograph said to be of the appellant's father together  with  Hekmatyr  or
the plausibility of the appellant's claim to have met with  approaches  from
the Taliban and Hezb-i-Islami forewarning of  their  intention  to  forcibly
recruit him.

37.  As  regards  TBOD  notion,  he  asked  us  to  consider  it  as  having
application  throughout  all  stages  of  consideration  of  an  applicant's
evidence, as seemingly in the approach of the Strasbourg Court.

38. Mr Bazini said that in relation to assessing the evidence  of  a  minor,
if the decision-maker only applied  TBOD  "principle"  at  the  end  of  the
assessment, that would be too late, because by then (as in this  case,  when
it  was  not  applied  at  all)  the  decision-maker  may  have  spent  many
paragraphs scrutinising the evidence with a  rigour  only  appropriate  when
dealing with the evidence of an adult.

39. At another point in his submissions Mr  Bazini  sought  to  qualify  the
above argumentation. Stating that he did not wish to assert that  there  was
only one definitive way of applying the rule: it could  be  throughout  (the
approach of the Strasbourg Court) or only at  the  end-point  (the  approach
set out in the UNHCR Handbook).  Both were valid applications.

40. Asked if to apply TBOD both holistically throughout the  assessment  and
at the end would involve impermissibly giving TBOD  twice  over,  Mr  Bazini
said that the holistic approach of being  cautious  to  disbelieve  was  not
strictly an application of TBOD "principle".


41. As regards the issue of whether TBOD notion (which  she  also  called  a
"principle") could have two applications,  Ms  Everett  for  the  respondent
said that in principle there could only be one application of  it.   It  was
not clear to her how the holistic version of it was any different  from  the
lower standard of proof; or at least she  had  difficulty  in  understanding
how one could apply a lower standard and TBOD "principle" separately.

42. Ms Everett submitted that the judge clearly applied the  lower  standard
of proof so already employed a liberal approach to the appellant's  evidence
in that sense.  It was clear that the appellant's age was uppermost  in  the
judge's mind and he had made a  proper  fact-sensitive  examination  of  its
implications for how his evidence should be assessed.  Indeed  in  paragraph
83 the  judge applied the principle in the appellant's  favour  in  relation
to his apparent ignorance in his screening  interview  of  the  identity  of
Hekmatyr; the judge had used  that  to  discount  one  of  the  respondent's
reasons for finding the appellant  not  credible.   She  accepted  that  the
appellant's interview contained  barely  any  discrepancies.   She  accepted
that in depicting  the  fact  of  undertaking  the  journey  to  the  UK  as
probative of the appellant's maturity, the judge had  not  given  "the  best
reason" and  had  been  "rather  speculative",  but  submitted  that  viewed
overall  the  judge's  assessment  that   the   appellant   had   a   mature
understanding comported with the interview record.


43. She accepted that the judge did not adequately address some  aspects  of
Dr Giustozzi's evidence that went to the  plausibility  of  the  appellant's
account.  In relation to the judge's alleged  failure  to  engage  with  the
evidence of the witnesses, she said she was  equally  in  difficulties.  She
said there was nothing perverse, however, about the judge's findings in  the
documentary evidence.


44. We adjourned  the  hearing  with  directions  which  were  confirmed  in
writing as being:-

    A. The relevance of the application of TBOD to the assessment of  facts
    and circumtances required under Article 4 [QD] and  paragraph  339L  of
    the Immigration Rules;


    B. Whether the terms of the Secretary of State's Asylum Policy Guidance
    (APG), as expressed in AA (unattended children) Afghanistan  CG  [2012]
    UKUT 16 (IAC) at [40] are still current and, if so, how  the  terms  of
    such guidance are  to  be  applied  to  the  assessment  of  facts  and
    circumstances required under Article 4 [QD] and paragraph 339L  of  the
    Immigration Rules;


    C. The relevance of the fact that, when assessing the credibility of an
    asylum  seeker's  claim,  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  have
    frequently concluded that it is necessary to give an asylum seeker  the
    TBOD (e.g. [71] SHH v UK {2012} 57 EHRR.18);


    D. The relevance of the Joint Presidential Guidance Note No 2 of  2010,
    and whether such Guidelines are consistent with the application of  the
    TBOD in the assessment of the facts  and  circumstances  of  an  asylum
    seeker's claim."


45. In summary the appellants' response to these questions  was   (in  reply
to A) to say that logically Article 4(5) and the  corresponding  Immigration
Rule, paragraph 339L, must be approached applying TBOD  to  the  claim;  (in
reply to B) the APG  was to be read as lending support  to  the  appellant's
submission that  TBOD should  be  given  to  each  and  every  aspect  of  a
particular claim, and even more generously  in  respect  of  a  claim  by  a
child; (in reply to C) the approach of the  Strasbourg  Court  was  that  if
after applying  TBOD there are "strong reasons" to question the veracity  of
a claim, then (but only then) the asylum  seeker  will  need  to  provide  a
satisfactory explanation for the discrepancies. In  relation  to  assessment
of the credibility of a child (and in order to give effect to the  principle
of the liberal application of TBOD) it would require something  very  strong
to overcome the presumption that child asylum seekers  have  TBOD;  and  (in
reply to D) the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note  does  not  directly  deal
with TBOD issue. The respondent's response was to say that (in reply  to  A)
applying the TBOD to the assessment of facts and circumstances in Article  4
of the QD and paragraph 339L of the Rules is  relevant  when  deciding  what
weight to attach to the evidence provided  by  an  applicant.  The  guidance
given in the UNHCR Handbook together  with  Article  4  together  forms  the
basis of the  respondent's  policy  guidance  to  decision  makers  entitled
"Considering asylum claims and assessing credibility".  This  guidance  does
not affect the burden of proof, which remains on the applicant, nor does  it
alter the standard of proof. In the respondent's guidance it is stated  that
a decision must be made whether to  give  an  applicant  the  TBOD  on  each
uncertain or unsubstantiated fact. TBOD needs to be considered  and  applied
appropriately to these uncertain facts when considering all the evidence  in
the round at the end of the credibility  assessment;  in  reply  to  B)  the
terms of the respondent's  APG  as  expressed  in  [40]  of  AA  (unattended
children) Afghanistan CG [2012]  UKUT  16  (IAC)  are  still  current.   The
concept of a more liberal application of TBOD does not change how it  is  to
be applied to an applicant. Rather it is recognition that  it  may  be  more
difficult for a child to prove their claim.  TBOD  is not a  separate  legal
test (see MD (Guinea) at [12]); (in reply to C) the "principle" of  TBOD  is
well-established in Strasbourg jurisprudence, but by reference to  paragraph
204 of the UNHCR Handbook it was something that will  "only  be  given  when
all available evidence had been obtained and checked and when  the  examiner
is satisfied as to the applicant's general credibility...";  and  (in  reply
to D) the Joint Presidential Guidance is largely concerned  with  procedural
matters although at 10.3 Assessing Evidence, judges are reminded of  certain
factors  that  may  affect  a  child/vulnerable  person's  ability  to  give
coherent  evidence.  The  guidance  contained  does  not   equate   to   the
application of TBOD but there is no inherent inconsistency between the  two.


46. On 18 March 2014, prompted  by  the  parties'  responses  to  the  above
questions, we  issued  further  directions  requesting  submissions  on  the
following further questions:


    (a)  Whether or not acceptance of TBOD affects the  standard  of  proof
         (the respondent submits that it does not);


    (b)  Is the (appellant's) contention that it is only after applying the
         TBOD that one turns to consider whether there are "strong  reasons"
         to question the veracity of an applicant's claim (and only if there
         are such reasons should an  applicant  be  required  to  provide  a
         satisfactory  explanation  for   discrepancies)   consistent   with
         paragraph 204 of the UNHCR Guidelines?


    (c)  In light of developments in the  law  in  Europe,  are  the  UNHCR
         Guidelines on TBOD still valid?


47. At the hearing on 15 May 2014 Mr Bazini rehearsed  UK case  law  on  the
standard of proof applicable in asylum cases, in particular its  restatement
by the Court of Appeal in  Karanakaran  [2000]  3  All  ER  449,  especially
Brooke LJ's statement at p.459 e that he interpreted  the  House  of  Lords'
judgment  in  R  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  ex  p.
Sivakumaran [1988] 1 All ER  193,  [1988]  AC  958  as  "creat[ing]  a  more
positive role for uncertainty" and  his  endorsement  of  the   approach  in
leading Australian cases which at p.469h he characterised as follows:

    "This  approach  does  not  entail  the  decision-maker  (whether   the
    Secretary of State or an adjudicator or the Immigration Appeal Tribunal
    itself) purporting to find "proved" facts,  whether  past  or  present,
    about which it is not satisfied on the balance of  probabilities.  What
    it does mean, on the other hand,  is  that  it  must  not  exclude  any
    matters from its consideration when it is assessing the  future  unless
    it feels that it can safely discard them because it has no  real  doubt
    that they did not  in  fact  occur  (or,  indeed,  that  they  are  not
    occurring  at  present).  Similarly,  if  an  applicant  contends  that
    relevant matters did not happen, the decision-maker should not  exclude
    the possibility that they did not happen (although believing that  they
    probably did) unless it has  no  real  doubt  that  they  did  in  fact
    happen."


48. Mr Bazini said that Karanakaran left  unclear  how  TBOD  notion  is  to
work.  The approach in Karanakaran  is  not  easily  reconcilable  with  the
UNHCR's two-stage approach or  the  two-stage  approach  of  the  Strasbourg
Court or the approach set out in Article 4 of the QD: in  all  three  it  is
only applies after the decision-maker  has  first  satisfied  himself  about
certain aspects of the applicant's account.  But  in  any  event  he  agreed
with the respondent that the principle could  not  affect  the  standard  of
proof.

49. As regards (c), Mr Bazini submitted that Article  4  specifies  how  the
evidence of an appellant should be treated if certain  conditions  are  met;
it does not say what should happen if they are not met.  The UNHCR  position
as set out in the 1979 Handbook seemed narrower.  Its  start-point  was  the
concluding part of assessment when  certain  evidence  had  been  presented.
The law had moved on since  the  1979  UNHCR  Handbook  so  as  to  be  more
favourable  to  applicants.   That  was  evident  from  the  modified  UNHCR
position taken in its CREDO study.

50. So far as concerns (b), Mr Bazini said that this  contention  was  based
on the approach of the Strasbourg Court,  which  was more  favourable  still
to applicants.  Whatever approach was adopted, it was essential that it  was
a holistic one that looked at all the evidence in the round.

51. Ms Everett reiterated the respondent's view that  TBOD  did  not  affect
the standard of proof. In relation to (b), she did  not  consider  that  the
Strasbourg and the UNHCR  approaches  were  irreconcilable.   Both  attached
particular  significance  to  the  fact  that  asylum-seekers  had   special
difficulties in  obtaining  evidence  from  their  countries  of  origin  to
support their claim. In relation to (c), she had nothing to add to what  was
said in the APIs. On any reading the "principle" was not  one  of  universal
application: if a decision-maker accepted an applicant's story as  credible,
there was no need to have  recourse  to  TBOD  "principle".   The  different
approaches were best looked at as different ways  of  getting  to  the  same
place.

52. Both representatives also addressed us on  the  specific  issue  of  the
notion of a liberal application of TBOD notion in relation to  children.  It
will be convenient to deal with their  main  points  when  considering  that
issue below.

53. Asked how they considered the Upper Tribunal should dispose of the  case
if we decided to set aside the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  Ms
Everett said she was content to leave the matter to the Tribunal, Mr  Bazini
said we should remit it, so as to ensure the applicant  was  not  prejudiced
by being denied a full set of appeal rights if the outcome was negative.  He
asked that whichever course the Upper Tribunal took it  bear  in  mind  that
there was no challenge to the witness evidence.





Discussion

Different understandings: two opposite approaches

54. It is clear from our earlier survey that significant  differences  exist
over the understanding  of  TBOD  in  the  asylum  field.  At  the  risk  of
caricature, it is possible to discern two approaches at opposite ends  of  a
spectrum.  At one extreme, there  is  what  we  shall  call  the  "pervasive
approach" which construes the  notion  as  one  which  must  be  applied  to
assessment of each and every item  of  evidence.  This  appears  to  be  the
approach advocated by La Forest J in the Canadian Supreme Court of Chan,  at
least as his  approach  was  portrayed  by  Major  J  at  [142]:  see  above
paragraphs 9-10. At the other extreme, there is  the  "end-point"  approach,
which understands the notion to be one that only applies  at  the  end-point
of assessment after the examiner has established  certain  facts  about  the
applicant's story and only when  there  is  doubt  about  certain  remaining
aspects of that story. The doubt arises because certain  essential  material
facts are not confirmed (or corroborated) or supported  by  other  evidence.
As articulated in the discussion of the rule in the  same  Chan  case,  this
latter approach is seen to be typified by that set out  in  the  1979  UNHCR
Handbook. One can even find examples where these two  contrasting  positions
are asserted at the same time, as is done by the respondent in  her  current
guidance  on  "Considering  asylum  claims  and  assessing  credibility"  at
paragraph 4.3.4: see above paragraphs 21, 45.

55. Clearly there are variants of both these approaches. We have  identified
as the "holistic approach"  one  in  which  TBOD  is  given  whenever  doubt
arises. Certainly at least for some commentators Article 4(5) of the  QD  is
akin to but  not  on  all  fours  with  the  UNHCR  Handbook's   "end-point"
approach. The 2013 UNHCR CREDO study records that  in  its  review  of  case
files in the UK the  rule  is  seen  to  apply  to  intermediate  stages  of
credibility assessment or more  precisely,  [this  review]  "indicated  that
some decision-makers may apply the principle of the  benefit  of  the  doubt
mid-way through the credibility assessment, before considering the  evidence
in the round" (paragraph 2.4.3.2, p. 233).

56. How are we to resolve these different understandings?

Usual meaning

57. In common idiom, giving  someone  TBOD  is  "to  decide  that  you  will
believe someone, even though you are  not  sure  that  what  the  person  is
saying is true" (Cambridge Academic  Content  dictionary).  Insofar  as  the
term applies to assessment  of  evidence  in  a  legal  context,  a  precise
definition of the phrase is elusive but it cannot mean much  more  than  the
following. For TBOD to be given something about  the  evidence  must  be  in
doubt. For evidence to be in doubt something about it must not  be  certain.
If it was certain, there would be no  need  to  give  any  benefit.  Benefit
being given in the  face  of  doubt  indicates  that  the  examiner  is  not
entirely convinced whether an asserted fact  is true or not,  and  so  gives
the subject the benefit of the most positive outcome they can, which  is  to
accept the facts narrated. Thus stated, it is a rule or  practice  that  can
be applied at any time during an inquiry into some asserted fact(s). It  can
be applied to the first, or last asserted fact(s) in a  series  of  asserted
facts, or any asserted  fact(s)  in  between.  But  recourse  to  the  usual
meaning does not necessarily help in an area of law which is in  many  ways,
sui generis, and  certainly  (as  emphasised  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
Karanakaran) unlike ordinary civil litigation.

Rationale

58. Looking at recourse made to the rule in asylum law  and  also  in  human
rights law dealing with the non-refoulement context  -  and  notwithstanding
the different understandings alluded  to  above  -   there  is  considerable
consensus about the underlying rationale of TBOD notion, which  is  twofold.
First it reflects what A. Grahl Madsen described  as  "the  well-known  fact
that a person who claims to be a refugee may have  difficulties  in  proving
his allegations": see e.g.  A.  Grahl-Madsen,  The  Status  of  Refugees  in
International Law, 1966, 145-146); the ECtHR in R.C.  v  Sweden.   We  shall
term this the "ameliorative" aspect.

59.  Second,  the  notion  helps  insure  against  the  particularly   grave
consequences of "getting it wrong" in a context  in  which  the  stakes  are
high:  sending back persons wrongly refused international protection  status
could result in their death or ill-treatment: see Karanakaran (Brooke LJ  at
[44], Sedley LJ at [17]).  We shall term this the "precautionary" aspect.

60. It will be observed as well, that very similar reasons  are  also  given
to explain the adoption of a lower standard of proof or for  there  being  a
shared burden of proof or a shared duty of cooperation on the applicant  and
respondent in certain contexts.

Not a rule of law

61. In order to arrive at a proper analysis of the scope and application  of
TBOD notion, it is first of all important to understand what it is  not.  It
is not to be considered as a rule of law.   As  stated  by  Laws  LJ  in  MD
(Guinea) at [12] (in relation to the "liberal application of the benefit  of
the doubt" notion):

    "... it is of particular  importance  that  the  plethora  of  guidance
    coming from many sources is not to be degraded into a set  of  concrete
    rules, departure from any one of which then falls to  be  characterised
    as an error of law. It is not for example a rule of law that a  child's
    evidence should be accorded "a liberal application of  the  benefit  of
    the doubt", a phrase appearing in some of the guidance documents.  That
    said, the phrase represents or points to  an  approach  which  in  some
    cases it may be very useful to have in mind."

62. Significantly, even the 1979 UNHCR Handbook recognises that  the  notion
is a defeasible one: paragraph 203  states  that  it  is  "frequently",  not
invariably "necessary to give the  applicant  the  benefit  of  the  doubt".
Likewise the "liberal application of the benefit of the  doubt"  notion  set
out at paragraph 219 is expressed as being one which it "may"  be  necessary
to apply to the known circumstances of a minor. Similarly, the ECtHR  states
that giving TBOD to asylum seekers when it comes  to  assessing  credibility
is something which it is "frequently", not always,  necessary  to  apply  to
their evidence: see R.C. v Sweden, supra paragraph 7.


Relationship to the burden of proof

63. Manifestly, at least as concerns the position in  UK  law,  TBOD  notion
cannot as such affect the burden of proof, which remains on  the  applicant:
see Elias LJ in HK (Afghanistan) at  [34].  In  passing,  we  would  observe
however that the duty imposed on the Member State by  Article  4(1)  QD)   -
and on decision makers in the UK by paragraph 339I of the Immigration  Rules
- to assess the relevant elements of an application "[i]n  cooperation  with
the applicant..." (emphasis  added)  must  at  least  have  an  ameliorative
effect in respect of an applicant being able to discharge that burden.

Relationship to the standard of proof

64. Understood in terms of its underlying rationale, it is  relatively  easy
to regard TBOD notion as an aspect of the lower standard  of  proof  applied
in the field of asylum (and asylum-related) law. If a  key  feature  of  the
lower standard of proof is, in  the  words  of  Brooke  LJ  in  Karanakaran,
affording "a positive role to uncertainty", then at  least  when  confronted
with doubts about an applicant's account, the decision-maker  must  consider
resolving at least some of them in his or her  favour.  Because  the  notion
only applies when there is doubt, it clearly cannot affect the  standard  of
proof itself. It can only regulate what response is to  be  given  consonant
with that standard where uncertainty or doubt arises.

65. At the same time (as already noted),  on  the  same  logic,  the  notion
cannot be a "pervasive" one  to  be  applied  to  each  and  every  item  of
evidence. To apply it thus  would  be  to  ignore  that  there  are  certain
asserted facts  which  can  and  should  be  accepted  or  rejected  without
reference to the notion of TBOD. Thus in the  U.S.  case  law  it  has  been
emphasised  that  if  an  applicant's  account  lacks  credibility  in   key
respects, then the notion  has  no  application:   see  e.g.  Sukwanputra  v
Gonzalez, 434 F.3d 627, 634-35 (3rd Cir, 2006). The point is explained  more
fully in the 2013 UNHCR CREDO study a 4.2 (p.247)  with  emphases  added  in
italics:

    "An asserted fact may be accepted because it is sufficiently  detailed,
    internally consistent, and  consistent  with  information  provided  by
    family members and witnesses, consistent with  available  specific  and
    general objective COI, and plausible when considered in  light  of  the
    applicant's individual and contextual circumstances.  Such facts may be
    accepted without reference to the  principle  of  the  benefit  of  the
    doubt.


    An asserted fact may be rejected because, when taking into account  the
    reasonableness of the  explanations  provided  by  the  applicant  with
    regard  to  the  potentially  adverse  credibility  findings  and   the
    applicant's individual and contextual  circumstances,  the  applicant's
    statements about that fact are not sufficiently  detailed,  consistent,
    and plausible, and/or are contradicted by  other  reliable,  objective,
    and time appropriate evidence.   Again,  such  facts  may  be  rejected
    without reference to the principle of the doubt because  the  principle
    cannot be applied to remedy what is clearly not credible based  on  all
    the available evidence."
66. Indeed there is a more fundamental reason why   a  "pervasive"  approach
should be discouraged. Even considered as one aspect of the  lower  standard
of  proof,  the  latter  is  ultimately  about  the   proper   approach   to
establishing proof of a risk and consideration of risk can only properly  be
made at the end-point. As expressed in slightly different language by  Kirby
J in Wu Shan Liang (1996) 185 CLR  259  at  [31]  (cited  with  approval  by
Brooke LJ and Sedley LJ in Karanakaran at [78] and [17] respectively):
      "Ultimately the question is whether the delegate [i.e. the decision-
      maker] allowed her mind to consider all the relevant possibilities by
      looking back at the entirety of the material placed before her and
      considering it against a test of what the "real", as distinct from
      fanciful, "chances" would bring if the applicant were returned to
      China."

67.  Sedley LJ returned to the same theme in SR (Iran) v Secretary of  State
for the Home Department [2007] EWCA Civ 460 - a case in which Mr Bazini  was
also Counsel for the appellant in the following terms:
    "6. Mr Bazini's argument on this issue seems to me to  make  the  basic
    mistake of seeking to import the ultimate question  of  risk  into  the
    evaluation of each piece of evidence. For example, he argues  that  the
    AIT, had it approached its  task  properly  in  �41,  might  well  have
    accepted "that there was a real risk of [A's] bearing witness" in Iran.
    On this premise he criticises the finding that A was not likely to bear
    witness to her friends in Iran as setting too high a standard of proof.


     7. It is evidently necessary to say something fairly basic  about  the
    key exercise of fact-finding and risk evaluation in  asylum  and  human
    rights cases. In Karanakaran [2000]  3  All  ER  449  this  court  gave
    guidance which included, at 479, the following:
      "No probabilistic cut-off operates here: everything capable of  having
      a bearing has to be given the weight, great or little, due to  it  ...
      The facts, so far as they can established, are signposts on  the  road
      to a conclusion on the issues; they are not themselves conclusions."
    8. Applying this approach to the present case, it was the  AIT's  task,
    first, to discard any evidence judged to be of no value at  all:  here,
    for example, the account which, for  better  or  for  worse,  had  been
    disbelieved on an earlier hearing. For the rest, the AIT  had  to  take
    each element of evidence into account for what it was  worth.  Some  of
    the evidence was worth a good deal to the appellant: for example the in-
    country evidence adopted in  �38  and  expanded  thereafter  about  how
    Christians are marginalised and subjected to  discrimination  in  Iran.
    Some of it, in the AIT's judgment, was  less  compelling:  for  example
    that the appellant would expose herself to persecution by evangelising.


    9. There is nothing wrong with the  differential  levels  of  proof  or
    disproof of primary facts found by the tribunal. In �41,  for  example,
    they find it likely that the appellant would  continue  with  Christian
    communion in Iran and that this would bring her to the attention of the
    authorities, but they do not accept that she would bear witness to  her
    friends. In �46 they find that the fact that her parents are pensioners
    does not necessarily mean that they would  be  unable  to  protect  her
    economically from persecution. The law does not  demand,  at  least  in
    this field, that each finding of fact, whatever its degree of certainty
    or uncertainty, be fitted into a  single  matrix  of  risk.  The  fact-
    finder's task is, to the extent made possible by the evidence, to  find
    facts, and some facts are more certain than others. It would have  been
    as unjust to the appellant to treat as mere possibilities things which,
    on the AIT's findings, were highly likely as it would have been to  the
    respondent to treat possibilities of hardship as probabilities.
    10. The critical adjudicative task is to assemble these  findings  into
    an evaluation which answers the question posed by law.  In  asylum  and
    human rights claims, that is the question of real risk, and  it  is  at
    the point of decision and not sooner that it arises."
68. It is clear from this analysis that it is incorrect for fact-finders  in
asylum cases to apply  the  lower  standard  to  each  and  every  piece  of
evidence except insofar as they are seeking to ensure that no asserted  fact
or item of  evidence  should  be  excluded  unless  there  is  certainty  or
finality about its value or lack of it: this brings us back to  what  Brooke
LJ described as "a positive role for uncertainty".

69. But whilst in this holistic but less open-ended  way  the  rule  may  be
said to inhere in the (lower) standard of proof, it adds  nothing  and  only
risks confusion to describe it as amounting to a TBOD "principle" or  "rule"
or "approach" or "basic concept[3]". It is not a rule of law or  universally
applicable principle, whereas the standard of proof to  be  applied  in  the
asylum field is a fundamental tenet.

70. Equally, even on the above analysis, it is difficult at least  at  first
blush to see that the notion can be confined in the way in which it  appears
to be in the 1979 UNHCR  Handbook  or  in  the  2013  UNHCR  CREDO  analysis
reformulation according to both of which the notion only comes into play  at
the end point of the credibility assessment, after  the  decision-maker  has
sought  to  accept  or   reject   what   asserted   facts   he   can.   (The
characterisation of this as an "end point" approach  is  clearly  stated  in
paragraph 4.1 (pp.246-7) of the CREDO study quoted at paragraph 14 above)


71. At least when construed as a means of  ensuring  a  "positive  role  for
uncertainty", it is hard to see  why  TBOD  notion  should  not  potentially
apply even at an early stage of the credibility  assessment,  e.g.  when  an
applicant is stating basic particulars (or "biodata") concerning where  they
live or what is their ethnic origin. If at an initial or intermediary  stage
there is uncertainty such that some item of evidence points one way,  whilst
another item points the other way, surely this  is  precisely  the  type  of
context in which the decision-maker should  (in  this  limited  sense)  give
TBOD.

72. Taken at face value, then, it is difficult to disagree  with  Mr  Bazini
that the 1979 UNHCR Handbook "end-point" understanding of the  rule  is  too
restrictive.

73.  On reflection, however, we agree with Ms Everett (and consider that  Mr
Bazini at one point acknowledged as much) that it is possible  to  reconcile
the two approaches. Given  that  the  "pervasive  approach"  overstates  the
scope of the rule's potential application  (since  if  there  is  no  doubt,
there is no benefit and the lower standard of  proof  is  essentially  about
how to approach proof of the ultimate question of risk) what is involved  in
this wider-ranging (albeit not untrammelled) holistic approach is simply  no
more than an acceptance that in respect of every asserted  fact  when  there
is doubt, the lower standard entails that it  should  not  be  rejected  and
should rather continue to be kept in mind as a possibility  at  least  until
the end when the question or risk is  posed  in  relation  to  the  evidence
considered in the round. In our judgment the fact that the Court  of  Appeal
in Karanakaran did  not  describe  its  espousal  of  a  positive  role  for
uncertainty  as  a  TBOD  rule  reflects  this  fact.  Their  lordships   in
Karanakaran built closely on Australian case  law.  Encapsulating  that,  in
the Australian case of Harjit Singh Randhawa v Milgea [1994]  124  ALR  265,
Beaumont J stated that decision-makers should take a "liberal  approach"  to
the assessment of evidence. In  Rajalingam  (Aus.FFC,1999)  the  same  Court
stated at [240] that:

    "[It] is not always possible for the decision-maker to be satisfied  as
    to whether alleged past events have occurred  with  certainty  or  even
    confidence. When the [decision-maker] is uncertain  as  to  whether  an
    alleged event occurs, or finds that,  although  the  probabilities  are
    against it, the event might have occurred, it may be necessary to  take
    into account the possibility that the event took place  in  considering
    the ultimate question".

74. We also take this to be the underlying reason why  Hathaway  and  Foster
in the new edition of Law of Refugee Status, 2014, after an analysis  citing
the Australian case law with approval, conclude that  (what  they  refer  to
as) "the principle" of TBOD really adds nothing of substance  to  the  lower
standard of proof or what they call the"intentionally low threshold  of  the
test of well-founded fear".

75.  We  still  consider,  however,  that  it  is  legitimate  to   continue
identifying and applying the rule of  TBOD  in  accordance  with  the  "end-
point" formulation given in the  1979  UNHCR  Handbook  so  long  as  it  is
understood as no more than useful particularisation of  the  lower  standard
of proof which, as we have seen, affords a  positive  role  for  uncertainty
when the decision-maker is confronted with an applicant  who  has  succeeded
in persuading the  decision-maker  of  certain  asserted  facts  but  cannot
dispel doubts about all of them and a conclusion has to  be  reached  as  to
the overall assessment. Whereas we  have  earlier  concluded  that  (i)  the
"pervasive" approach to the  notion  is  incorrect  (because  it  cannot  be
applied to each  and  every  item  of  evidence);  and  (ii)  the  "holistic
approach" does not add anything  of  substance  to  the  lower  standard  of
proof, we think that  in  the  context  identified  in  the  1979  Handbook,
reference to the notion does help clarify the  task  in  hand  and  to  make
clear that before any  "signing-off"  the  evidence  has  to  be  considered
overall. Such an approach also acts as a  safeguard  against  any  premature
evaluation of the ultimate question of risk of the type abjured  by   Sedley
LJ in SR (Iran).

76. To the extent that it can be argued that the  "end-point"  approach  set
out in the 1979 UNHCR Handbook is too restrictive, it seems to us  that  the
answer is that just because the rule is  only  (or  should  only  be)  given
specific articulation at the  "end-point"  does  not  mean  that  an  asylum
applicant has not had  the  benefit  earlier  on  of  a  positive  role  for
uncertainty.

77. To the extent that it could be argued  that  to  apply  the  "end-point"
formulation  of  the   rule   is   tantamount   to   giving   an   applicant
(impermissibly) TBOD  twice over, our  answer is that since  the  underlying
premise   of  the  "end-point"  formulation  is  that  earlier  on  in   the
assessment the decision-maker has afforded throughout a  positive  role  for
uncertainty (which we take to be the thrust of  paragraphs  195-202  of  the
UNHCR Handbook),  to  apply  it  in  this  way  simply  ensures  it  is  not
overlooked at one particular (and particularly important) stage.



The TBOD in Strasbourg jurisprudence

78. We find it unnecessary  in  this  decision  to  seek  to  interpret  the
precise import of the  approach  to  TBOD  set  out  by  the  ECtHR  in  its
jurisprudence relating to Article 3 in the  context  of  assessing  risk  on
return, but we would make this observation. Whilst that approach is  clearly
wider than an "end-point" approach, we are  not  convinced  that  it  is  as
holistic or pervasive as Mr Bazini  submits,  since  the  Court  appears  to
envisage that in  certain  circumstances  the  notion  is  disapplied  "when
information  is  presented  which  gives  strong  reasons  to  question  the
veracity of an asylum  seeker's  submissions":  see  I  v  Sweden,  61204/09
[2013] ECtHR 813, at [50] (supra paragraph 8.  (  Insofar  as  it  might  be
suggested that in R.C. v Sweden  the Court was envisaging  that  in  certain
circumstances  the burden of proof shifts from the applicant to  the  state,
we would regard ourselves as bound  to  follow  domestic  authority  to  the
contrary: see PJ (Sri Lanka) [2014] EWCA Civ 1011,  approving  NA  (UT  rule
45: Singh v Belgium) Iran [2014] UKUT 205 (IAC) and  MJ  (Singh  v  Belgium:
Tanveer Ahmed unaffected) Afghanistan [2013] UKUT 254 (IAC).)

Article 4(5) of the Qualification Directive (QD)

79. Perhaps unsurprisingly given the dearth of case law, neither  party  was
able to give us much assistance in relation to the question  as  to  whether
Article 4(5) QD has replaced or modified the  UNHCR  Handbook's  formulation
of TBOD notion. Since our hearings dealing with the  appellant's  case  some
light has been shed on Article 4(5) by Advocate  General  Sharpston  in  her
Opinion in  Joined Cases C-148/13, C-149/13 and C-150/13, A,  B  and  C,  17
July  2014.  At  [50]  she  observes  that  in  general  terms  neither  the
Qualification Directive  nor  the  Procedures  Directive  (2005/85/EC)  make
specific provision for the manner in which an applicant's credibility is  to
be assessed and that "the general position is that, in  the  absence  of  EU
rules on a subject, it is for the  domestic  legal  system  of  each  Member
State to determine  the  procedural  conditions  governing  actions  at  law
intended to ensure the protection conferred by EU law."  Earlier,  at  [42],
she observed that:
    "42.      Article 4(1) allows Member States to  place  the  onus  upon
    applicants '... to submit as soon as possible all  elements  needed  to
    substantiate the application for international protection  ...'.   That
    provision also places a positive  duty  on  Member  States  to  act  in
    cooperation with the applicant to assess the relevant elements  of  his
    application. The assessment should be  carried  out  on  an  individual
    basis and should include taking into account the applicant's individual
    position and personal circumstances.  Article 4(5) of the Qualification
    Directive acknowledges that an applicant may  not  always  be  able  to
    substantiate  his  claim  with  documentary  or  other  evidence.  Such
    evidence is therefore not required where the cumulative  conditions  of
    Article 4(5)(a) to (e) are met."
80. The Advocate General goes on to emphasise  at [56]-[57] that "  it  does
not follow from the lack of any express wording in the Directive  regulating
Member States' discretion regarding the practices or methods  for  assessing
an  applicant's  credibility,  that  EU  law  places  no  limits   on   that
discretion." She highlights the role of the Charter:
    "57.      The Charter provides  overarching  standards  that  must  be
    applied in the  implementation  of  any  directive.  The  Qualification
    Directive harmonises by introducing  minimum  standards  for  obtaining
    refugee status within the European Union.  It would undermine the CEAS,
    in particular the Dublin system, if Member States were to apply  widely
    divergent practices when  assessing  such  applications.  It  would  be
    undesirable  if  the  differences  in   its   implementation   led   to
    applications being more likely to succeed in one jurisdiction  than  in
    another because the evidentiary requirements were easier to satisfy. "
81. In light of this  Opinion  and  other  academic  commentary  it  can  be
discerned that the effect of Article 4(5) (for those Member States  who  opt
to apply the principle according to which it is the duty  of  the  applicant
to substantiate the application for international protection) is limited  to
the situation where aspects of the applicant's statements are not  supported
by documentary or other evidence (i.e. a situation where there is a lack  of
corroboration). By Article 4(5) the applicant in such a situation  will  not
need to provide confirmation (corroboration) when the conditions  enumerated
under (5) are  cumulatively  met[4].  These  conditions  relate  to  genuine
effort (4(5)(a)), satisfactory explanation (4.5(b)), plausibility  (4(5)(c),
earliest possible application (4(5)(d) and general credibility (4(5)(e)).

82. As such, does Article 4(5)  enunciate  a  TBOD  rule?  We  have  already
referred to the position taken by the respondent in the APIs which  is  that
this provision does enunciate such a  rule  (see  above  paragraphs  18,21).
That is lent some degree of support by the observation made  by  Hailbronner
in EU Immigration and Asylum Law-Commentary, 2010, at p.1030 that  the  text
of Article 4(5) was based in part on the UNHCR Handbook.

83. However, stating that Article  4(5)  is  based  "in  part"  on  the  HCR
Handbook does not demonstrate that this provision codifies such a  rule  and
the idea that it does so  is  not  shared  by  the  most  in-depth  academic
commentary so far, that by Gregor Noll, "Evidentiary assessment and  the  EU
qualification directive", UNHCR Working Paper  no.  117  in  New  Issues  in
Refugee Research, June 2005. Describing Article 4(5) as  comprising  overall
"a qualified alleviating evidentiary rule", Noll cautions at p.12:

    "The wording  of  [this  rule]  signifies  a  heavier  burden  for  the
    applicant than the analogue principle of "benefit  of  the  doubt",  as
    this is described in UNHCR's handbook. In addition to the  requirements
    given in the handbook, article  4.5  places  at  least  one  additional
    condition on the applicant', s/he  is  required  to  have  applied  for
    international protection as early as possible unless s/he  can  provide
    good reasons for not doing so".


84. Of course, had we accepted that Article 4(5) of the QD is to be read  as
codifying a TBOD rule, then we would have to revise  our  earlier  statement
that this notion is not a rule of law. That is because, in the  UK,  Article
4(5) has been implemented by paragraph 339L of the  Immigration  Rules  (see
above, paragraph 20) which for most purposes do have the force of law.

85. But (like Noll)  we  think  it  unwise  to  refer  to  Article  4(5)  as
reflecting or encapsulating  a TBOD rule. In part that is because  we  think
that the provision seeks primarily to identify  one  particular  application
of the lower standard of proof (which in our view affords  a  positive  role
for uncertainty). In  part  this  relates  to  the  point  we  have  already
emphasised, namely that this provision is, limited to cases where  there  is
a lack of corroboration: viz., "where aspects of the applicant's  statements
are not supported by documentary or  other  evidence"  (chapeau  to  Article
4(5)); that on its face is more limited in scope than the notion as set  out
in paragraph 204 of the UNHCR Handbook (where the precondition is that  "all
available evidence has been obtained and checked and when  the  examiner  is
satisfied as to the applicant's general credibility"). In  part  is  because
whereas the notion is formulated in the UNHCR  Handbook  in  defeasible  and
contingent  terms,  Article  4(5)  sets  out  in  mandatory  terms[5]   four
conditions which have to be cumulatively met in order for an  applicant  not
to be required to substantiate his application. As  such  we  think  Article
4(5) (and paragraph 339L of the Rules)  should be applied as it  is  without
any gloss or reference to  the  UNHCR  Handbook  "analogue".  We  understand
UNHCR's concern, as expressed in the 2013 CREDO study, that if not  read  in
the light of the UNHCR Handbook, Article 4(5) could operate as a policy  for
withholding TBOD from asylum-seekers; but we  consider  that  danger  to  be
offset by (i) the fact that the ambit of Article 4(5) is  limited  to  cases
of  non-corroboration/confirmation;  and  (ii)  the  fact  that   applicants
benefit throughout the assessment of credibility from the lower standard  of
proof, which in the terminology of Karanakaran, ensures  that  the  entirety
of that assessment affords a positive role for uncertainty.

TBOD and children


86. We are now in a position to address the  main  specific  issue  in  this
case,  which  concerns  whether  a  decision-maker  must  make  a   "liberal
application" of TBOD notion when it comes to assessing the credibility of  a
minor. In essence Mr Bazini's central contention on this issue was that,  in
general, when  assessing  the  credibility  of  minors  the  "principle"  of
liberal application of TBOD should  be  applied,  and  certainly  cannot  be
disapplied on the basis of a child's maturity. Ms Everett disagreed.

87. We deal first with the notion of a liberal application of TBOD as it  is
expressed in paragraph 219 of the 1979 UNHCR Handbook.

88. It is clear from the language of paragraphs  213-219  of  this  Handbook
(which deal with assessment of the credibility of minors and  paragraph  219
(which expressly refers to "a liberal application  of  the  benefit  of  the
doubt") that the notion has a broader scope than  the  "end-point"  analysis
set out in paragraph 203.  Notably, paragraph  217  states  that  where  the
minor has not reached a sufficient degree of maturity to  make  it  possible
to establish well-founded fear in the same way as for an adult, "it  may  be
necessary  to  have  greater  regard  to  certain  objective  factors"   and
paragraph 219 states that:

    "219. If the will of the parents cannot be ascertained or if such  will
    is in doubt or in conflict  with  the  will  of  the  child,  then  the
    examiner, in cooperation with the experts assisting him, will  have  to
    come to a decision as to the well-foundedness of the  minor's  fear  on
    the basis of the known circumstances, which  may  call  for  a  liberal
    application of the benefit of the doubt."

89. Both of these paragraphs envisage that (a liberal application  of)  TBOD
may need to be given to assessment of the credibility of a  child  at  every
stage; certainly there is no confinement to just an "end-point". This  might
appear to suggest that in relation to children TBOD notion has a  conceptual
life of its own.

90. By taking trouble to first set out the learning in  the  asylum  context
on the notion of TBOD in general, we hope it will be apparent that  (and  we
do  not  understand  either  party  to  submit  otherwise),   the   "liberal
application"  concept  can  only  be   adjectival  and  cannot  affect   the
underlying nature of the notion. If, as we have  held,  TBOD  is  neither  a
legal rule nor a principle nor a notion to be applied invariably, it  cannot
be converted into one by a more liberal application of it.  (The  fact  that
is not a rule to be applied invariably  is  clear  in  any  event  from  the
wording of the Handbook which itself treats  it  as  a  discretionary  rule:
paragraph 219 states that a minor's known circumstances  "may"  call  for  a
liberal application of  the  notion.)  Accordingly,  except  insofar  as  it
operates as a useful reminder of what a  decision-maker  should  do  at  the
"end-point" of the assessment of the credibility of a minor, the  notion  of
a liberal application of TBOD is best understood simply as an expression  of
how the lower standard  of  proof  is  to  be  applied  in  making  such  an
assessment. Application of that standard  when  the  subject-matter  is  the
evidence of a child must take account of the fact that the  applicant  is  a
child and that children in general are vulnerable in a way most  adults  are
not.

91. There are, however, arguably two extra dimensions to  this  notion  that
arise in the UK context. The first possible  dimension  brings  us  back  to
paragraph 351 of the Immigration Rules which, we recall, provides that:

    "A person  of  any  age  may  qualify  for  refugee  status  under  the
    Convention and the criteria in paragraph 334  [dealing  with  Grant  of
    Asylum] applied to all cases.  However, account should be taken of  the
    applicant's maturity and in assessing the claim of a child more  weight
    should be given to objective indications of risk than  to  the  child's
    state  of  mind  and  understanding  of  his  situation.    An   asylum
    application made on behalf of the child  should  not  be  refused  only
    because the child is too young to  understand  the  situation  or  have
    formed a well-founded fear of persecution.  Close attention  should  be
    given to the welfare of the child at all times."

92. The second possible dimension consists of  the  Asylum  Policy  Guidance
(APG) whose key provisions we also cited earlier but for ease  of  reference
we set out again here. They  state  that  the  following  principles  to  be
applied in the determination of a claim to asylum by a child:

    "(1) more weight must be given to objective indications of risk than to
         the child's state of mind;


    (2)  other factors to consider  might  include:  documentary  evidence,
         objective country evidence;


    (3)  a case owner must not draw  an  adverse  credibility  interference
         from omissions in the child's knowledge if it is likely that  their
         age or maturity is a factor  or  if  there  are  logical  or  other
         reasons for those omissions;


    (4)  the benefit of the doubt will need to be applied  more  generously
         when dealing with a child particularly where a child is  unable  to
         provide detail on a particular element of their claim."


93. As to the first possible extra dimension, we  note  that  paragraph  351
does not articulate  any  TBOD  notion  and  quintessentially  its  contents
primarily convey what is necessary  in  order  for  an  examiner  to  ensure
sensitive application of the lower standard  of  proof  in  respect  of  the
evidence of a child. As to the second possible  dimension,  we  straightaway
acknowledge that if the APG provisions are more generous than the notion  as
expressed in the 1979 Handbook, then it would be not in accordance with  the
law for a decision-maker to fail to apply a more generous policy:  see  Abdi
v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1995] EWCA  Civ  27.  However,
first of all the APG places reliance on the guidelines set out in  the  1979
Handbook and does not purport to go beyond them; and secondly,  the  factors
that are highlighted as ones the examiner should bear in  mind  are,  again,
best understood as  expressing  what  is  entailed  in  applying  the  lower
standard  of  proof  to  the  assessment  of  the  evidence  of   a   child.
Accordingly, we consider on analysis  that  neither  paragraph  351  of  the
Rules nor the APG provisions relating to the evidence of children alter  the
general position we have reached in relation to the TBOD notion in  general.


94. However, whether understood in the way we have just set out or  (as  the
parties contended) as a distinct "principle", we still need to  engage  with
Mr Bazini's  underlying  argument  that,  in  general,  when  assessing  the
credibility of minors liberal application  of  TBOD  should  be  given,  and
certainly cannot be disapplied on the basis of a child's  maturity.   Indeed
it was the failure to appreciate this point, he said, that  led  the  First-
tier Tribunal judge into one of a number of  legal errors. He  submits  that
valid reasons for disapplying the notion should only have  to  do  with  the
nature of the applicant's evidence (there being no reason to apply  it,  for
example, if the applicant has given a credible story in all respects or  has
failed to establish any elements of his claim).  Such reasons should not  or
cannot relate to characteristics of an individual applicant.   According  to
Mr Bazini, characteristics such as age, education, intelligence, health  etc
may have a bearing on credibility but do not in themselves provide  a  basis
for disapplying TBOD.

95. Even leaving aside whether (as we have held) the  notion  of  TBOD  adds
nothing of substance to the lower standard of proof, we  are  not  persuaded
that Mr Bazini's general proposition as regards the liberal  application  of
TBOD to children is tenable. The UNHCR Handbook itself emphasises more  than
once that in asking whether a minor may  qualify  for  refugee  status  that
must be "determined in the first instance according to  the  degree  of  his
mental development and maturity": see paragraph 214. Further,  the  Handbook
only describes it as being necessary  to  have  greater  regard  to  certain
objective factors - one of the main consequences of applying a liberal  TBOD
- if "the minor has not reached a sufficient degree of maturity to  make  it
possible to establish a well-founded fear in the same way as for an  adult":
see paragraph 217.

96. To our understanding that indicates that for the  Handbook  the  liberal
application of TBOD, which is expressed in defeasible terms anyway, may  not
necessarily be given if the applicant has equivalent maturity to an adult.

97. Mr Bazini  sought  to  argue  that  if  the  FtT  judge's  approach  (of
considering that maturity justified disapplying TBOD notion)  were  correct,
it would call into question the  "very  principle  of  the  benefit  of  the
doubt" applied to asylum-seekers generally. Even again assuming this  notion
amounts to a distinct rule, we cannot agree.  For  a  judge  to  proceed  to
assess the evidence of a minor without any indication that  he  or  she  has
considered the modified approach enjoined by paragraph 351 may often  result
in an error of law, because under that provision more weight must  be  given
to objective evidence. But that is quite different from the situation  where
a judge  considers  whether  either  paragraph  351  considerations  or  the
(liberal application) of TBOD should be given and decides not  to  give  it.
We disagree with Mr Bazini's reasoning for two main reasons. First  of  all,
the fact that the notion per se  is  a  defeasible  not  a  categorical  one
entails that it is capable of being  disapplied  in  certain  circumstances.
Second, contrary to what Mr Bazini asserts,  one  does  when  assessing  the
evidence even of adult asylum-seekers, distinguish between for example  more
or less  intelligent  or  educated  individuals.  Indeed,  failure  to  take
account of such differences may well infringe the rule set  out  in  Article
4(3)(c) of the Qualification Directive (also expressed  in  paras  41-43  of
the  UNHCR  Handbook),  that  assessment  of  a  claim   for   international
protection  includes  taking  into  account  "the  individual  position  and
personal  circumstances  of  the  applicant  including   factors   such   as
background, gender and age..."

An adult applicant's evidence about events when he was a child

98. In his skeleton argument at [11] Mr Bazini stated that:

    "In respect of adults who are relying on events that took  place  at  a
    time when they were minors, it is submitted that insofar as  they  rely
    on any evidence given in interviews and statements etc  when  they  are
    still minors, the more liberal benefit of the doubt principle should be
    applied.  One could not expect the same  principle  to  be  applied  to
    evidence generally given after they had attained the age  of  majority.
    However, if an adult (e.g. a 20 year old) is giving  evidence  that  he
    experienced/observed when he was a minor it has to be noted that memory
    and understanding of these  events  will  have  been  as  a  minor  and
    therefore this specific evidence should have the liberal benefit of the
    doubt approach applied to it.  It would be  irrational  to  accept  the
    evidence of a 15 year old in respect of a particular account of  events
    but reject that some account given  three  years  later,  once  he  had
    turned 18, unless it could clearly be shown that his understanding  and
    knowledge  of  the  events  should  have   become   greater   or   more
    sophisticated over the three year period etc."

99. Whilst we have declined to follow Mr  Bazini's  view  that  the  liberal
application of TBOD is a cardinal principle, we would concur at  least  that
a child-sensitive application of the lower standard of proof may still  need
to be given to persons if they are  recounting  relevant  events  that  took
place at a time when they were minors or were even younger minors

100. It is also necessary to keep in mind that there is  not  necessarily  a
"bright-line" for assessment of evidence in the context  of  asylum  between
the stage at which a person is a minor and the  stage  at  which  he  is  an
adult: see e.g. KA (Afghanistan) and others v Secretary  of  State  for  the
Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 1014 at [18].

Joint Presidential Guidance Note No.2 of 2010

101. For completeness (in order to address a further question  we  posed  to
the parties),  we  agree  with  the  parties  that  the  Joint  Presidential
Guidance Note No.2 of  2010  (which  is  based  on  the  Senior  President's
Practice Direction First-tier and Upper  Tribunal  Child,  Vulnerable  Adult
and Sensitive Witnesses October 2008) is neutral as to the issue of  whether
applicants are entitled to TBOD, although they do  reinforce  the  important
point (also set out in paragraph 351 of the Immigration Rules and in  Asylum
Policy Instructions) that when  assessing  the  evidence  of  children  (and
other vulnerable  persons)  certain  factors  may  affect  such  a  person's
ability to give coherent evidence.

Summary of main conclusions on the two main issues

102. Drawing together the points we have made in the course of our  analysis
so far we conclude:

a) In the context of assessing the  credibility  of  an  asylum  claim,  the
notion of TBOD as set out in paragraphs 203-204 of the 1979  UNHCR  Handbook
is not a rule of law and  even  as  a  general  guideline  is  expressed  in
defeasible and contingent  terms.

b) In its usual meaning the notion can potentially apply  at  any  stage  of
the assessment of credibility and is not limited, as it  is   in  paragraphs
203-204 of the Handbook, to consideration of  its "end-point"; but  even  so
it cannot to be applied to each and every item of evidence, irrespective  of
whether there is doubt about it.

c) Seen as a notion applying holistically TBOD adds nothing of substance  to
the lower standard of proof, which, as construed by Brooke  and  Walker  and
Sedley LLJ in Karanakaran v Secretary of State [2000]  3  All  ER,  449-480,
affords a "positive role for uncertainty".

d) Nevertheless, as  formulated  within  the  limited  context  set  out  in
paragraphs 203-204 of the 1979  UNHCR  Handbook,  the  notion  serves  as  a
useful reminder of one of the most important things  a  decision-maker  must
do at the "end-point" of any credibility assessment. To apply it within  the
limited context set out in these paragraphs of the Handbook does not  entail
in effect giving an applicant TBOD twice over; it simply  particularises  in
a specific way what it means to apply  the  lower  standard  of  proof  when
certain,  but  not  all,  aspects  of  an  applicant's   claim   have   been
established.

e) Whilst the notion of TBOD as articulated in the 1979 UNHCR  Handbook  was
one source for the drafting of Article 4(5) of the Qualification  Directive,
and whilst there is some overlap with this provision, the latter,  which  is
confined in any event to setting out the conditions  under  which  the  need
for corroboration or "confirmation" can be dispensed with, must  be  applied
in its own terms. Unlike the Handbook Guidelines,  it  sets  out  conditions
that are rules of law.

f) The notion as set out in paragraph 219 of the UNHCR  Handbook  that  when
assessing  the  evidence  of  minors  there  may  need  to  be  a   "liberal
application of the benefit  of  the  doubt"  is,  like  its  parent  notion,
neither a rule of law not a rule of universal application  and,  save  as  a
reminder about what the examiner should bear in mind at the  "end-point"  of
assessment of credibility, adds nothing of substance to the  lower  standard
of proof. Further, depending on individual circumstances  of  the  case,  it
may be a reason not to apply the notion if an applicant possesses  the  same
maturity as an adult.

  Decision on error of law

103. In light of the above, we turn to consider whether the FtT judge  erred
in law. We observe that in the appellant's case he was not someone  who  had
failed to submit any corroborative evidence; he had submitted  his  father's
ID card and a photograph of his father with  the  Hezb-i-Islami  leader.  We
recall to mind that Mr  Bazini's  submissions  advanced  five  grounds:  see
above paragraph 34.

104. In respect of the first ground we would  reject  Mr  Bazini's  argument
that the mere fact of declining to apply the liberal benefit of  doubt  rule
to the appellant amounted to an error  of  law.   As  explained  above,  the
parent rule of the TBOD is not to be understood as a legal  rule  nor  as  a
principle and even in its  classic  formulation  it  is  not  understood  as
requiring invariable application. The  same  cannot  be  any  less  true  in
relation to the concept of a liberal application of  this  notion  which  is
also, in any event, expressed in defeasible terms.

105. We would, however, agree with Mr Bazini that some of the reasons  given
by the judge for disapplying (the liberal application of) the  notion,  even
when understood as a rule ensuring a positive  role  for  uncertainty,  were
tenuous.  If the  judge  wished  to  construe  the  appellant's  journey  to
journey to the UK as evidence of maturity, then he needed to explain why  he
did not accept that the appellant was being  chaperoned  by  agents  or  had
left all the arrangements to them.  If the judge  wished  to  rely  in  this
regard on the comprehensivity of the appellant's account, then he needed  to
explain why at [87] he held against him the fact that he  was  not  able  to
give a detailed picture of his brother's activities.

106. These failures of explanation were of particular importance  because  -
irrespective of whether he needed to apply a benefit of  the  doubt  rule  -
the judge should have started from the position that (at least  in  relation
to the appellant's recounting of events when he was a minor)  paragraph  351
had potential application and hence that "in assessing the claim of a  child
more weight should be given to objective indications of  risk  than  to  the
child's state of mind and understanding of his  situation".   That  in  turn
would have enhanced the potential of the expert report of  Dr  Giustozzi  (a
report which drew on various country of origin reports)  to  shed  light  on
the appellant's case. Unlike TBOD notion  set  out  in  the  UNHCR  Handbook
paragraph 351 identifies obligations on the decision maker  which  have  the
force of law.

107. From the above it will be apparent that  the  judge  nowhere  addressed
the issue of to what extent his assessment  should  take  into  account  the
accepted fact that the key events recounted by the  appellant  had  occurred
when he was a minor: for example, on the judge's account when the  appellant
said his family home had been visited by the  authorities  on  two  previous
occasions, at most he would have been no more than 14-16. The judge  nowhere
suggested he thought that when aged 14-16 the appellant was mature  for  his
age; hence no  reason  whatsoever  is  given  for  not  affording  a  child-
sensitive approach to this aspect  of  his  claim  (so  as  to  ask  whether
recollection of things that had happened when  the  appellant  was  a  child
might have been less reliable than if they  had  happened  when  he  was  an
adult).

108. We also consider that the determination was  vitiated  by  legal  error
through a failure to engage sufficiently with the  evidence  of  the  expert
witness, Dr Giustozzi.  The judge does refer  to  his  report  when  dealing
with the issue of general risk on return: see [94]  and  in  the  first  two
sentences of [88].  In the remainder of [89] the judge notes:

    "According to the evidence, the appellant's father was well-regarded as
    a Hezb-i-Islami commander in the area while his elder  brother  started
    to dress as a Hezb-i-Islami member and to carry a Kalashnikov  rifle  a
    year before he left home.  The appellant  says  he  became  aware  that
    people were reporting his father and brother  for  their  Hezb-i-Islami
    connections.  Dr Giustozzi states that  the  Afghan  security  services
    have  a  wide  network  of  informers  in  the  villages,  passing   on
    information  about  the  movement  of  suspect  individuals.   He  also
    expresses the view that the fact that the appellant's father  was  with
    Hezb-i-Islami in the past would be seen by the  security  forces  as  a
    member of the pro-insurgency inclinators of the whole family."


109. Yet, having set out this evidence, the judge's  immediate  response  in
the next paragraph, [89], is to  state  "against  this  background,  I  have
substantial doubts about the credibility of  the  appellant's  account  that
the security forces were looking for him".  If by this background  he  meant
to  include  Dr  Giustozzi's  evidence,  then  his  statement  that  he  has
"substantial doubts about the credibility of the appellant's account"  is  a
non-sequitur.  That background supported the  appellant's  account.  If  the
judge meant something different by the reference  here  to  "background"  he
should have said so.  In any event, the judge's summary  of  Dr  Giustozzi's
evidence leaves out the fact that the latter had also  stated  that  in  his
opinion the photograph showed Hekmatyr with his "key men".  Since the  judge
went on to find that at best the photo showed the appellant's father  to  be
a mere Hezb-i-Islami member, it can be deduced that he  disagreed  with  the
expert, but no reasons are given.  Presumably as well (in finding  that  the
appellant's whereabouts would have been well-known to  the  authorities  for
some time), the judge disagreed with Dr  Giustozzi  that  it  was  plausible
that the authorities only started paying an interest in the  appellant  when
the situation in Nangarhar deteriorated in  2006-2007.   Dr  Giustozzi  also
considered there was  a  plausible  explanation  for  the  authorities  only
having made a "perfunctory" search of the appellant's home on  two  previous
occasions.  Again the judge does not address that:  he  simply  reached  the
opposite conclusion.

110. Whilst it is unnecessary to address the other grounds,  we  would  note
that we think that the judge did sufficiently  engage  with,  and  evaluate,
the evidence of the other witnesses.  We think the  judge's  conclusions  on
the family tracing issue were viable.  We  see  nothing  in  the  contention
that somehow the judge was bound  by  Singh  v  Belgium  app.no.33210/11  to
approach the issue of the reliability  of  the  documents  differently:  see
above paragraph 78.

111. For the above reasons the FtT judge erred in law and in ways making  it
necessary to set his decision aside.

112. We raised with the parties how, if we decided  to  set  aside  the  FtT
decision, we should proceed to deal with it.  Mr Bazini  submitted  that  in
fairness we should remit it to the First-tier.   Such  a  course  would,  he
said, be in accordance with the Senior President's  Practice  Statement.  We
observe that the Practice  Statement  (which  has  now  been   amended  with
effect from 13 November 2014) does not prescribe which course of  action  is
to be adopted and  that  paragraph  7.3  states:  "  Re-making  rather  than
remitting will nevertheless constitute the normal  approach  to  determining
appeals where an error of law is found, even if some  further  fact  finding
is necessary."  Whilst in the appellant's case the  nature  of  the  judge's
errors are such that no finding of fact can be preserved, we  are  conscious
that this case has now been in the  appellate  process  for  a  considerable
time and was in fact remitted to the First-tier once before, on 21  November
2012, an error of law having been found in an  earlier  determination  by  a
FtT on 3 August 2011.

113. If the only consideration were speed, remittal might ordinarily  result
in a quicker rehearing, but we intend to give directions to ensure that  the
case is kept in the Upper Tribunal and is expedited.

114. Mr Bazini submits that to  decline  to  remit  would  be  to  deny  the
appellant his full panoply of onward appeal rights, but that is true of  any
case retained in the Upper Tribunal when an error of law is  found  and  the
decision is set-aside.

115. Mr Bazini appeared to submit at one  point  that  whichever  course  we
chose to adopt we should preserve the findings  made  by  Judge  Knowles  in
relation to the witnesses which,  he  says,  were  not  challenged.  Leaving
aside  that  the  judge's  determination  does  record  concerns  about  the
evidence of the witnesses as well as the  appellant  (see  e.g.  [86],  line
17), we consider that given our reasons for concluding that the judge  erred
in his overall approach to credibility regarding  events  which  took  place
when the appellant was a minor (which the  witnesses  also  sought  to  give
evidence about), it would be quite wrong to try and pick and choose  certain
findings and say they were unaffected by this error.

116. For the above reasons:

The First-tier Tribunal erred in law in a way necessitating that we set  his
    decision aside.

The case is to be listed before the  Upper  Tribunal  with  directions  that
this (re-) hearing be expedited.

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal or  Court
directs  otherwise,  no  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify the Appellants.  This  direction  applies  to  both  the
appellants and  to  the  respondent  and  a  failure  to  comply  with  this
direction could lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.

Upper Tribunal Judge Storey
-----------------------
[1] We venture nothing here about use of the notion  more  generally  except
to note that  its  origins  trace  back  to  Aristotle.  In  Roman  law  (as
expressed in the maxim  in  dubio  pro  reo)  and  some   continental  legal
systems it has been seen in criminal law as a corollary of  the  presumption
of innocence and the burden of proof of beyond reasonable doubt (in  Germany
in that context it is a  constitutional  principle).  It  plays  a  part  in
international criminal law: see e.g. Natetilic and Martinovic, Case No.  IT-
03-66-A, cited in  Fatmir  Limaj  et  al,  Appeals  Chamber  ICTY,  27.9.07,
paragraphs 20-22. Seeming use of the  principle  is  made  in  international
humanitarian law in the context of the  presumption in favour of  protection
of civilians: see  Article 50(1)  of  Additional  Protocol  I  to  the  1949
Geneva Conventions which  states that "[i]n case of doubt whether  a  person
is a civilian, that person shall  be  considered  to  be  a  civilian".  See
further E. Wilmshurst and  S.  Breau,  Perspective  on  the  ICRC  Study  on
Customary International Humanitarian Law (CUP, 2007),  pp.  10-11,  111-112,
406. Domestically, the  benefit  of  the  doubt  rule  has  been  frequently
applied in age assessment cases: see e.g. TS v  London  Borough  of  Croydon
[2012] EWHC 2389 (Admin), but here, as in its deployment  in  UKBA  guidance
to caseworkers on Assessing Age, 17 June 2011, at para 2.21, it is  seen  as
a criterion derived from asylum law.
[2] Article 4 of the QD provides that "Member States  may  consider  it  the
duty of the applicant to submit as soon as possible all elements  needed  to
substantiate the application for international  protection.  In  cooperation
with the applicant it is  the  duty  of  the  Member  State  to  assess  the
relevant elements of the application".
[3] The term used by J.Sweeney, op.cit.,707.
[4] In the IARLJ study (op.cit. at para 9) the requirements of Article  4(5)
are said to "form an exhaustive list and each  must  be  satisfied  for  the
claimant to have the benefit of that lack of  need  for  confirmation.  This
gives partial statutory effect in those circumstances to the concept of  the
application of the 'benefit of  the  doubt'  to  which  the  UNHCR  Handbook
refers at paragraphs 203 and 204. Article 4.5, however, applies only  'where
Member States apply the principle according to which it is the duty  of  the
applicant to substantiate the application' - that is where the MS  exercises
its option to rely on the first sentence of Article 4.1 either  specifically
or because  this  principle  forms  part  of  its  national  law  concerning
evidential requirements".
