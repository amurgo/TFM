This decision follows a remote hearing in respect of which  there  has  been
no objection by the parties. The form of remote hearing was by  video  (V),
the platform was Skype for Business. A face to face hearing  was  not  held
because it was not practicable and all  issues  could  be  determined  in  a
remote hearing.

An applicant is "eligible to apply for leave to remain as a partner"  within
the meaning of para E-LTRPT.2.3  of  Appendix  FM  only  if  it  is  readily
apparent from  the  information  contained  in  their  application  and  any
information  available  to  the  Secretary  of  State  that  they  meet  the
autonomous definition of "partner" in GEN.1.2. of  Appendix  FM  unless  the
route under which the application is  being  made  clearly  provides  for  a
different meaning of "partner".


Judge Blum:

Background

   1. There is no  dispute  as  to  the  factual  matrix  underpinning  this
      challenge. The applicant is a national of Pakistan born on 14  January
      1985. He married Aliya Ahmad, a British citizen, on 15 August 2013. He
      was granted entry clearance to the United Kingdom as the spouse of  Ms
      Ahmad on 14 January 2015, with leave valid until 14 October  2017.  He
      arrived in the United Kingdom on 29 January 2015. Ms Ahmad gave  birth
      to their child on 28 October 2015. The marriage however ended  with  a
      divorce on  26  August  2016.  The  applicant's  entry  clearance  was
      consequently curtailed on 9 November  2016  so  as  to  expire  on  15
      January 2017.

   2. On 2 December 2016 the applicant applied for Limited Leave  to  Remain
      (LTR) under the 5-year parent route, the  requirements  of  which  are
      contained in Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules. The respondent  was
      satisfied the applicant met the requirements of paragraphs R-LTRPT.1.1
      (a), (b) and (c) and, on 10 December 2016, he was granted  LTR  for  a
      period of 30 months ending on 30 June 2019.

   3. In May 2017 the applicant began a relationship  with  Razia  Begum,  a
      British citizen. They began to cohabit  in  December  2017.  She  gave
      birth to their child on 20 November 2018.

   4. On 29 June 2019 the applicant applied for further LTR as a parent of a
      British citizen child. The application was principally  based  on  his
      continuing relationship with his eldest child.

The decisions under challenge

   5. The application was determined in a decision dated 1 October 2019. The
      decision made no reference to the applicant's  relationship  with  his
      eldest child or to  the  5-year  parent  route  in  Appendix  FM.  The
      applicant was informed that he did not meet  the  requirements  for  a
      grant of leave under the 10-year partner  route  under  paragraphs  R-
      LTRP.1.1.(d) of Appendix FM because:

         Your partner is unmarried,  and  you  have  not  provided  2  years
         evidence of co-habitation prior to the application.


         You therefore fail to meet the requirements of GEN1.2. of  Appendix
         FM of the Immigration Rules.

   6.  The  respondent  however  considered  that  there  were  "exceptional
      circumstances" in the applicant's case, as understood by reference  to
      GEN.3.2. of Appendix FM, which would render a refusal of LTR a  breach
      of Article 8 ECHR. The respondent accepted that the applicant  held  a
      genuine relationship with both his British citizen partner  and  child
      (although it is unclear which child was being referred  to)  and  that
      any removal of the applicant would result in a breach  of  Article  8.
      The applicant was therefore granted a period of  30  months  LTR  but,
      significantly for him, this was now on the 10-year partner route under
      paragraph D-LTRP.1.2 of Appendix FM.

   7. On 9 October 2019 the applicant requested  a  reconsideration  of  the
      decision to grant him LTR under the 10-year partner route. I have  not
      been provided with a copy of this application but nothing turns on it.
      It is apparent from the reconsideration decision,  dated  20  November
      2019, that the applicant was aggrieved that he had been placed on  the
      10-year route to settlement and believed he should have been granted a
      further period of LTR under the 5-year parent route to settlement.  It
      is uncontroversial that the applicant  and  Ms  Begum  had  only  been
      living  together  for  approximately  1�  years  when  he   made   his
      application in June 2019. He could not therefore meet  the  definition
      of partner contained in GEN.1.2.

   8. In her reconsideration decision of 20  November  2019  the  respondent
      acknowledged that the applicant had previously been granted LTR  under
      the  5-year  parent  route  to  settlement   but   stated   that   his
      circumstances, as detailed in his June 2019 application and supporting
      documents, had changed. The decision explained:

         As you now have a partner your application was considered under the
         partner routes of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules. However, as
         you fail to meet the requirement of GEN.1.2. of Appendix FM of  the
         Immigration Rules, as detailed in our decision letter of 01 October
         2019, you do not meet the requirements for leave as  a  partner  on
         either the 5 or 10 year routes to settlement.


         As you now have a partner you do  not  meet  the  requirements  for
         leave as a parent on either the 5 or 10 year routes  to  settlement
         as you fail to meet the requirement of E- LTRPT.2.3.


         However, as detailed in  our  letter  of  01  October  2019,  under
         paragraph  GEN.3.2.  of  Appendix   FM,   there   are   exceptional
         circumstances in your case which would render refusal a  breach  of
         Article 8.


         Any grant of leave on the basis  of  exceptional  circumstances  is
         either leave outside the rules or on one of the 10 year  routes  to
         settlement  as  a  partner  or  parent.  Leave  on  the  basis   of
         exceptional circumstances is not granted  on  one  of  the  5  year
         routes to settlement as a partner or parent, as appropriate. As you
         have a partner you were granted a period of 30 months limited leave
         to remain on the 10-year partner route under paragraph D-  LTRP.1.2
         of Appendix FM.


         I hope this clarifies our decision making process.

   9. The applicant lodged  his  judicial  review  on  3  January  2020.  In
      summary, he asserts that the term "partner" in E-LTRPT.2.3(b)(iii)  of
      Appendix FM should be given the same  meaning  as  the  definition  of
      partner under GEN.1.2 of that Appendix, and that if he does  not  meet
      that definition of "partner" he cannot be  said  to  be  "eligible  to
      apply for leave to  remain  as  a  partner".  The  respondent  however
      contends that the term "eligible to apply for leave  to  remain  as  a
      partner" is to be given a broader meaning.


  10. Permission to proceed with the judicial review challenge  was  granted
      on the papers by Upper Tribunal Judge Norton-Taylor in a decision sent
      on 8 February 2020.

Relevant legislative framework

  11. Paragraph GEN.1.2. of Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules provides:

         GEN.1.2. For the purposes of this Appendix "partner" means-


         (i) the applicant's spouse;


         (ii) the applicant's civil partner;


         (iii) the applicant's fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner; or


         (iv) a person who has been living together with the applicant in  a
         relationship akin to a marriage or civil partnership for  at  least
         two years prior to the date  of  application,  unless  a  different
         meaning  of  partner  applies  elsewhere  in  this  Appendix.   [my
         emphasis]

  12. GEN.3.2. of Appendix FM is  located  under  the  heading  'Exceptional
      Circumstances'. GEN.3.2. states, so far as material for this decision:


         (1) ... where an application for entry clearance or leave to  enter
         or remain made under this Appendix, or an application for leave  to
         remain which has otherwise been  considered  under  this  Appendix,
         does not otherwise meet the requirements of this Appendix or Part 9
         of  the  Rules,  the  decision-maker  must  consider  whether   the
         circumstances in sub-paragraph (2) apply.


         (2) Where sub-paragraph (1) above applies, the decision-maker  must
         consider,  on  the  basis  of  the  information  provided  by   the
         applicant, whether there are exceptional circumstances which  would
         render refusal of entry clearance, or leave to enter or  remain,  a
         breach of Article 8 of the European  Convention  on  Human  Rights,
         because  such  refusal  would   result   in   unjustifiably   harsh
         consequences for the applicant, their partner, a relevant child  or
         another family member whose Article 8 rights  it  is  evident  from
         that information would be affected by  a  decision  to  refuse  the
         application.


         (3)  Where  the  exceptional  circumstances  referred  to  in  sub-
         paragraph (2) above apply, the  applicant  will  be  granted  entry
         clearance or leave  to  enter  or  remain  under,  as  appropriate,
         paragraph  D-ECP.1.2.,  D-LTRP.1.2.,  D-ECC.1.1.,  D-LTRC.1.1.,  D-
         ECPT.1.2., D-LTRPT.1.2., D-ECDR.1.1. or D-ECDR.1.2.


  13. The requirements for further leave to remain as a parent are  set  out
      in section R-LTRPT of Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules.  Paragraph
      R-LTRPT.1.1. of Appendix FM, so far as relevant, provides:

         LTRPT.1.1. The requirements to be met for limited leave  to  remain
         as a parent are-
         ...
         (c)
             ...


             (ii) the applicant meets all of the  requirements  of  Section
         ELTRPT:
             Eligibility for leave to remain as a parent ...

  14. The "Eligibility" requirements include the following:

             E-LTRPT.2.3. Either-


             (a) the applicant must have sole parental  responsibility  for
             the child or the child normally lives with the  applicant  and
             not their other parent (who is a British Citizen or settled in
             the UK), and the applicant must not be eligible to  apply  for
             leave to remain as a partner under this Appendix; or


             (b) the parent or carer with whom  the  child  normally  lives
             must be-


             (i) a British Citizen in the UK or settled in the UK;


             (ii) not the partner of the applicant (which here  includes  a
             person who has been in a relationship with the  applicant  for
             less than two years prior to the date of application); and


             (iii) the applicant must not be eligible to apply for leave to
             remain as a partner under this Appendix. [my emphasis]

  15. The respondent has produced guidance on how caseworkers are  to  apply
      the Immigration Rules. Of relevance is the  'Family  Policy  -  family
      life  (as  a  partner  or  parent),  private  life   and   exceptional
      circumstances', version 5.0. This reads, in material part,  under  the
      heading 'Family life as a parent - eligibility',  and  the  subheading
      'Eligibility that must be met by a parent on  a  5  or  10-year  route
      (without consideration of exceptional circumstances under GEN.3.1.  or
      GEN.3.2.)':

             For both entry clearance and leave to remain applications as a
             parent, if the child normally lives with their  other  British
             citizen or settled parent or carer, that person cannot be  the
             partner of the applicant (which for leave to remain includes a
             person who has been in a relationship with the  applicant  for
             less than 2 years prior to the date of  application)  and  the
             applicant must not be eligible to apply for entry clearance or
             leave to remain as a partner under Appendix FM.


             The parent route is not for couples who are in a  genuine  and
             subsisting partner relationship. An applicant cannot meet  the
             parent route if they are or will be eligible  to  apply  under
             the partner route, including where for example the  definition
             of partner cannot be met, or other  eligibility  criteria  for
             access to a 5-year route  are  not  met.  Applicants  in  this
             position must apply or will only be considered (where they are
             not required to make a valid application), under  the  partner
             route, or under the private life route.

The applicant's submissions

  16. I summarise the written and oral submissions made by  Mr  B  Malik  on
      behalf of the applicant. The applicant meets all the requirements  for
      a grant of leave to remain as a parent under the 5-year  parent  route
      in Appendix FM as he  did  not  meet  the  definition  of  partner  in
      GEN.1.2. of Appendix FM and was not therefore "eligible to  apply  for
      leave to remain as a partner under this Appendix."


  17. When approaching the term "eligible to apply for leave to remain as  a
      partner" the Tribunal should apply the principles enunciated in  Mahad
      v Entry Clearance Officer [2009] UKSC 16 and determine the natural and
      ordinary meaning of the words in the context of an  objective  reading
      of  the  structure  and  wording  of  the  relevant  provisions.   The
      references to "partner" in Appendix FM should, as a starting point, be
      read with reference to the autonomous definition contained in GEN.1.2.
      unless a different meaning of "partner" applies. A  different  meaning
      of "partner" can only  "apply"  if  the  wording  of  Appendix  FM  so
      prescribes, or by necessarily implication from the relevant provision.



  18. Appendix FM, read as a whole, does not support  an  interpretation  of
      the term "partner" in paragraph E-LTRPT.2.3(b)(iii) that differs  from
      the autonomous definition in paragraph GEN.1.2. If  such  a  departure
      from the autonomous definition had been  intended  then  paragraph  E-
      LTRPT.2.3(b)(iii) itself, or some  other  specific  provision  in  the
      Immigration Rules, would have expressly said so. By  way  of  example,
      paragraph E-LTRPT.2.3(b)(ii) specifically provides  that  a  "partner"
      includes "a person who has been in a relationship with  the  applicant
      for less than two years prior to the date of application". Paragraph E-
      LTRPT.2.3(b)(iii) in contrast contains no such provision.

  19. To the extent that the respondent contends that the words "eligible to
      apply" in paragraph E-LTRPT.2.3(b)(iii) connotes a  meaning  different
      from the autonomous meaning in GEN.1.2., this is to  be  rejected.  If
      eligibility in the sense of a mere  ability  to  make  an  application
      under the partnership route was sufficient  to  exclude  an  applicant
      under paragraph E-LTRPT.2.3(b)(iii) this could lead to "odd outcomes".
      The applicant gives an example of a person whose application under the
      "partner" route could be refused  because  the  relationship  was  not
      accepted as genuine, but an  otherwise  meritorious  claim  under  the
      "parent" route would simultaneously be refused because the person  was
      deemed "eligible to apply" under the "partner" route.

  20. The applicant rejects the respondent's contention,  contained  in  her
      Detailed Grounds of Defence, that the "general scheme and structure of
      Appendix FM to the Immigration  Rules"  would  be  undermined  by  the
      construction he advances. Although a person  who  fails  to  meet  the
      requirements of Appendix FM may, by virtue of  paragraph  GEN.3.2,  be
      granted LTR as a partner under the 10-year route, GEN.3.2 invites  the
      decision-maker to carry out a residual Article 8 assessment where  the
      substantive requirements of Appendix FM are not met. Although such  an
      assessment is triggered by the provisions of Appendix FM  itself,  the
      substantive requirements of the assessment are  not  confined  to  the
      provisions of Appendix FM. Appendix  FM  demarcates  cases  which  can
      conceivably succeed under the substantive provisions of  the  Appendix
      alone ('Appendix FM cases') from those - such as that of the applicant
      - which cannot succeed under the substantive  provisions  ('Article  8
      cases'). The applicant's proposed interpretation is  not  inconsistent
      with this distinction in principle. The Family Policy guidance  is  of
      no assistance in interpreting the Immigration Rules, as per the ruling
      in Mahad and Pokhriyal v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1568, at [39] - [42].


  21. The applicant finally rejects the  respondent's  contention  that  his
      interpretation would enable individuals to  choose  whether  to  apply
      under the parent or  partner  route  which  would,  according  to  the
      respondent, compromise the financial requirements for applicants under
      the  partner  route  and  which  would  enable  them  to  avoid  those
      requirements by applying under the parent route.

The respondent's submissions

  22.  The  respondent  contends  that  the  construction  advanced  by  the
      applicant ignores the significance of the words "eligible to apply" in
      paragraph E-LTRPT.2.3. This provision is not triggered simply  when  a
      person actually qualifies for leave to remain as a partner or in  fact
      meets all the requirements for leave to remain as a partner. There  is
      a distinction between someone who qualifies as a partner  and  someone
      who is eligible to  apply  as  a  partner.  As  the  applicant  had  a
      'partner' at the time of his application he was at least "eligible  to
      apply" on the basis of his  relationship  with  Ms  Begum.  This,  the
      respondent submits, was sufficient to hold that he did  not  meet  the
      requirement in E-LTRPT.2.3.


  23. The respondent further contends that  the  applicant's  interpretation
      undermines the general scheme and structure of Appendix FM.  A  person
      may  qualify  for  LTR  under  Appendix  FM  on  the  basis  of  their
      relationship with a settled person even in the circumstances where the
      definition in GEN.1.2 of that Appendix is not met. As happened in this
      case, although the applicant did not meet the definition in  paragraph
      GEN.1.2 of Appendix FM, he was granted leave  to  remain  pursuant  to
      paragraph  GEN.3.2  of  that  Appendix  on  account   of   exceptional
      circumstances. There is therefore no basis for the suggestion  that  a
      person's failure to  meet  the  definition  in  paragraph  GEN.1.2  of
      Appendix FM somehow excludes him or her from that Appendix altogether.




  24. The  applicant  ignores  the  significance  of  the  words  "unless  a
      different meaning of partner applies elsewhere in  this  Appendix"  in
      GEN.1.2 of Appendix FM. These words make plain that the definition  in
      that provision does not apply to the word  "partner"  whenever  it  is
      used, irrespective of its context. The context in which this  word  is
      used in paragraph E-LTRPT.2.3 of Appendix FM to the Immigration  Rules
      is clear. The obvious purpose is to limit grants of LTR as a parent to
      those who are not eligible to apply for LTR as  a  partner  under  the
      Appendix. When read in its proper context, the word "partner" in  this
      provision is not limited to an applicant who has a partner that  meets
      the definition in paragraph GEN.1.2 of Appendix FM.

  25. With respect to the guidance document 'Family Policy: Family life  (as
      a partner or parent), private  life  and  exceptional  circumstances',
      this provides that an applicant cannot meet the  requirements  of  the
      parent route if they are or  will  be  eligible  to  apply  under  the
      partner route, including where the definition of "partner"  cannot  be
      met. The respondent does not invite the Tribunal to  read  the  policy
      guidance as an aid to the construction of the Immigration  Rules,  but
      the  document  is  obviously   correct   and   consistent   with   the
      interpretation advanced by the respondent.

  26. Finally, the  applicant's  construction  would  enable  applicants  to
      choose whether to apply under the parent  or  the  partner  route  and
      this,  in  turn,  would  compromise  the  financial  requirements  for
      applicants under the partner route and  would  enable  them  to  avoid
      those requirements by applying under the parent route.

Discussion

  27. In Mahad v Entry Clearance Officer [2009] UKSC 16 Lord Brown  stated,
      at [10]:

           There is really no dispute about  the  proper  approach  to  the
           construction of the Rules. As Lord Hoffmann said  in  Odelola  v
           Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009]  1  WLR  1230,
           1233 (paragraph 4):


                 "Like any other question of construction, this  [whether  a
                 rule change applies to  all  undetermined  applications  or
                 only to subsequent applications] depends upon the  language
                 of the rule, construed  against  the  relevant  background.
                 That involves a consideration of the immigration rules as a
                 whole  and  the  function   which   they   serve   in   the
                 administration of immigration policy."


           That is entirely consistent  with  what  Buxton  LJ  (collecting
           together a number of dicta from past cases concerning the status
           of the rules) had said in Odelola in the Court  of  Appeal  and,
           indeed, with what Laws  LJ  said  (before  the  House  of  Lords
           decision in Odelola) in the present case. Essentially  it  comes
           to this. The  Rules  are  not  to  be  construed  with  all  the
           strictness applicable to the construction  of  a  statute  or  a
           statutory instrument but, instead,  sensibly  according  to  the
           natural and ordinary meaning of the words used, recognising that
           they are statements of the Secretary of  State's  administrative
           policy. The respondent's counsel readily accepted that what  she
           meant in her written case by the proposition  "the  question  of
           interpretation is . . . what the Secretary of State intended his
           policy to be" was that the court's task is to discover from  the
           words used in the Rules what the  Secretary  of  State  must  be
           taken to have intended. After all, under  section  3(2)  of  the
           Immigration Act 1971, the Secretary of  State  has  to  lay  the
           Rules before  Parliament  which  then  has  the  opportunity  to
           disapprove them. True, as I observed in Odelola (para 33):  "the
           question is what the Secretary of State intended. The rules  are
           her rules." But that intention is to  be  discerned  objectively
           from the language used, not divined  by  reference  to  supposed
           policy considerations. Still less is the  Secretary  of  State's
           intention to be discovered from  the  Immigration  Directorates'
           Instructions (IDIs) issued intermittently to  guide  immigration
           officers in their application  of  the  rules.  IDIs  are  given
           pursuant to paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 2 to the 1971  Act  which
           provides that:


                 "In  the  exercise  of  their  functions  under  this   Act
                 immigration officers shall  act  in  accordance  with  such
                 instructions (not inconsistent with the immigration  rules)
                 as may be given them by the  Secretary  of  State  .  .  ."
                 (emphasis added)."

  28. I adopt and  apply  the  approach  identified  in  Mahad.  I  note  in
      particular that the Immigration Rules, including Appendix FM,  are  to
      be construed sensibly according to the natural and ordinary meaning of
      the words used, recognising that they are statements of the  Secretary
      of State's administrative policy. I bear  in  mind  further  that  the
      Secretary of State's intention is to be discerned objectively from the
      language  used,  not  divined  by   reference   to   supposed   policy
      considerations or from her Instructions, Guidance or Policy documents.

  29. Neither party was able to locate any authority considering the meaning
      of the term "eligible to apply" and my attention was not drawn to  any
      other provision within the immigration laws containing  or  concerning
      that term.


  30. Although neither party referred me to the  Oxford  English  Dictionary
      definition of 'eligible', I consider it to be of  some  assistance  in
      discerning the natural  and ordinary meaning of the  phrase  "eligible
      to apply for leave to remain as a partner" and thus the  Secretary  of
      State's intentions. The relevant definition of "eligible" reads:


         Fit or proper to be chosen for an office,  position,  award,  etc.;
         regarded as fulfilling the necessary criteria or qualifications  to
         be considered for a particular benefit.


  31. The relevant term, as it  appears  in  paragraph  E-LTRPT.2.3(b)(iii),
      requires an applicant under the parental route to "not be eligible  to
      apply for leave to remain as a partner under this Appendix." There  is
      a distinction between  someone  who  is  "eligible  to  apply"  for  a
      particular position or status and someone who  meets  the  substantive
      criteria necessary for the grant of that position or status. Paragraph
      E-LTRPT.2.3(b)(iii) could have stated, by  way  of  example,  that  an
      applicant must not be eligible for 'a grant of leave to  remain  as  a
      partner'. The natural and ordinary meaning of the words used  indicate
      that the substantive criteria for the grant of LTR  as  a  partner  is
      distinct from the threshold criteria that governs eligibility to apply
      for LTR as a partner.


  32. What then is the threshold criteria for an applicant  to  be  eligible
      for apply for leave to remain as a partner? On the most expansive view
      anyone could be considered as being eligible to  make  an  application
      for a particular  immigration  status  if  their  eligibility  is  not
      measured by reference to compliance with the substantive criteria  for
      the grant  of  that  status.  This  could  conceivably  mean  that  an
      applicant is "eligible to apply" for LTR as a partner even if they  do
      not have a partner in the general sense of the word. I do not  however
      consider this to be a sensible construction or one that was  envisaged
      by the Secretary of State. The respondent's submissions  did  not,  in
      any event, go this far and focused instead on the meaning of "partner"
      (see,  for  example,  paragraph  21  of  the   respondent's   skeleton
      argument). It is irresistibly implicit in the  submissions  from  both
      parties that they regarded the  word  "partner"  as  conditioning  the
      threshold criteria. This is not surprising given  that  the  threshold
      criteria in E-LTRPT.2.3(b)(iii) is framed by  reference  to  the  word
      "partner". This suggests that the threshold criteria that must be  met
      to make an applicant "eligible to apply  for  leave  to  remain  as  a
      partner" is that they meet, at least  on  a  prima  facie  basis,  the
      meaning of "partner" (a person may of course ultimately be refused LTR
      as a partner if, on detailed consideration, it is found that  they  do
      not meet the definition of partner).  What  then  is  the  appropriate
      meaning of "partner"?

  33. I agree with Mr B Malik that the  starting  point  is  the  formal  or
      autonomous  definition  in  GEN.1.2.  This  definition  requires   the
      applicant to have lived together with the person with whom he  or  she
      is in a relationship akin to marriage for at least two years prior  to
      the date of  the  application.  These  requirements  stand  "unless  a
      different meaning of partner applies elsewhere" in  Appendix  FM.  The
      effect of the proviso is that, unless "a different meaning of  partner
      applies elsewhere", the definition in GEN.1.2. falls  to  be  applied.
      This approach is supported by the legal principles of consistency  and
      certainty.

  34. E-LTRPT.2.3.(a) requires, inter alia, that "the applicant must not  be
      eligible to apply  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  partner  under  this
      Appendix". There is no express qualification to  the  word  "partner".
      There is however an express qualification in E-LTRPT.2.3.(b)(ii). This
      states that the parent or carer with whom  the  child  normally  lives
      must be "not the partner of  the  applicant  (which  here  includes  a
      person who has been in a relationship with the applicant for less than
      two years prior to the  date  of  application)".  E-LTRPT.2.3.(b)(iii)
      does not contain this qualification. If the qualification was intended
      to apply to either E-LTRPT.2.3.(a) or (b)(iii)  one  would  reasonably
      have expected this to have been expressed in clear  terms.  A  textual
      analysis  of  the  structure  and  content  of  E-LTRP.2.3.  therefore
      supports the construction advanced by the applicant.

  35. Nor can I find any phrase or term within  E-LTRPT.2.3  or  Section  E-
      LTRPT or Appendix FM in general that would  support  the  respondent's
      contention that a different and more expansive definition of "partner"
      was intended for either E-LTRPT.2.3.(a) or  (b)(iii).  The  respondent
      has pointed out that GEN.3.2. enables her to grant LTR as a partner if
      an applicant does not otherwise meet the requirements of  Appendix  FM
      and a refusal to grant LTR would breach  Article  8  ECHR  because  it
      would  have  unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  on,  inter  alia,  an
      applicant's partner. GEN.3.2. is however designed to enable an Article
      8 proportionality assessment to be undertaken within  the  context  of
      Appendix FM and is not concerned with the formal  requirements  needed
      to make an application under Appendix FM (indeed GEN.3.1.(1)  explains
      that it can apply even if an application for LTR  is  not  made  under
      Appendix FM). Moreover, E-LTRPT is  concerned  with  applications  for
      LTR, not with grants of leave. The possibility of a grant of LTR as  a
      partner is, in any event, a separate matter from compliance  with  the
      Eligibility requirements. In these circumstances it  is  difficult  to
      see how the construction advanced by  the  applicant  "undermines  the
      general scheme and structure of Appendix FM." The fact that  a  person
      may be granted LTR under GEN.3.2. as a partner even  if  they  do  not
      meet the definition of partner in GEN.1.2 does not meaningfully assist
      in understanding what is meant by "eligible  to  apply  for  leave  to
      remain as a partner."


  36. I have additional concerns with the respondent's contention  that  the
      term "eligible to apply for leave  to  remain  as  a  partner"  in  E-
      LTRPT.2.3.(a) or (b)(iii)  contemplates a different meaning of partner
      from the  autonomous  meaning  contained  in  GEN.1.2.(iv).  There  is
      nothing in  those  provisions  explaining  or  identifying  what  that
      different meaning is. A specific different meaning is prescribed in E-
      LTRPT.2.3(b)(ii), but if that meaning was  intended  to  apply  to  E-
      LTRPT.2.3.(a) and (b)(iii) there is no reason why it was not expressly
      stated in these provisions. In the absence of any  indication  of  the
      nature of the different meaning that the respondent  maintains  should
      be ascribed to "partner", the  definition  in  GEN.1.2.  falls  to  be
      applied.  Moreover,  a  potential  applicant  reading   the   relevant
      Immigration Rules should be able to  readily  ascertain  whether  they
      meet the criteria for being eligible to apply for leave to remain as a
      partner as this is relevant in determining whether they could  succeed
      in their application. It would, in my judgment, offend common sense to
      expect an applicant who is contemplating making an  application  under
      the parent route and who is reading the  relevant  Immigration  Rules,
      and in particular paragraph GEN.1.2. and  paragraph  E-LTRPT.2.3.,  to
      conclude that a different meaning to that in GEN.1.2. applies  to  the
      word "partner" in E-LTRPT.2.3(b)(iii), or to expect such an  applicant
      to able to ascertain what that  different  meaning  is.  A  reasonable
      applicant would conclude, based on the natural and ordinary meaning of
      the term under scrutiny, that they would not be eligible to apply  for
      leave to remain as a  partner  if  it  was  clear  from  the  evidence
      supporting their application and their answers in the application form
      that they had not lived with the person  with  whom  they  were  in  a
      relationship akin to marriage for at least two years.


  37. Mr Z Malik submitted that the applicant's proposed construction  would
      enable applicants to choose whether to apply under the parent  or  the
      partner route, and this would enable those who chose the parent  route
      to avoid the stricter financial requirements contained in the  partner
      route. I do not accept this submission. There is in reality no  choice
      available to applicants who may wish to apply under the  parent  route
      if they are in fact "eligible to  apply  for  leave  to  remain  as  a
      partner" (i.e. if the definition of partner in GEN.1.2. is or  appears
      to be met on the face of the application or based on  the  information
      available to the Secretary of State). I additionally note that the 10-
      year partner route does not require an applicant to meet the financial
      requirements for LTR as a partner. In any event,  an  applicant  under
      the 5-year parent route must still meet  financial  requirements  that
      ensure they can adequately maintain and accommodate themselves without
      recourse to public funds. Any difference in  the  level  of  financial
      maintenance required under the 5-year partner route does not undermine
      the construction advanced by the applicant in  light  of  the  natural
      meaning of the language used in Appendix FM.


  38. Both parties accepted that the Family Policy  guidance,  the  relevant
      part of which is set out at paragraph 15 above, was not to be used  as
      an aid to interpreting the Immigration Rules as per the authorities of
      Mahad and Pokhriyal. Mr Z Malik invited me to  find  that  the  Family
      Policy  guidance  was  obviously  correct  and  consistent  with   the
      interpretation advanced by the respondent.  For  the  reasons  I  have
      given I  do  not  accept  that  the  Policy  Guidance  is  correct  or
      consistent with the natural and ordinary meaning of the words used  in
      Appendix FM.

  39. In my judgment an applicant is "eligible to apply for leave to  remain
      as a partner" only if it is  readily  apparent  from  the  information
      contained in their application and any information  available  to  the
      Secretary of  State  that  they  meet  the  autonomous  definition  of
      "partner" in GEN.1.2. of Appendix FM, unless the route under which the
      application is being made clearly provides for a different meaning  of
      "partner".

  40. The judicial review claim is granted.
