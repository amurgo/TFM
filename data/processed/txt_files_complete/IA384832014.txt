                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant, a citizen of Nigeria, applied for leave to remain  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Migrant pursuant to paragraph  245ZX  of  HC  395,  as
    amended (the Immigration Rules). His application  was  refused  because
    (i) he failed to submit a valid Certificate of Acceptance  for  Studies
    (because the  licence  of  his  Tier  4  Sponsor  was  revoked  by  the
    Respondent after the  date  of  application  but  before  the  date  of
    decision); and (ii) because he had not met the requirement that he  has
    to apply for leave to remain for the purpose of studies which  commence
    within 28 days of the expiry  of  his  current  leave  to  remain.  The
    Respondent's position was that the Appellant's leave expired on 29 July
    2014 and his course did not start until 8 September 2014.

 2.  The Appellant's appeal against that decision was heard by  Judge  Juss
    (the Judge) on 11 December 2014 and dismissed, the  reasons  for  which
    are contained in his decision which was promulgated on 12 January 2015.



 3. The grounds of appeal are twofold. Firstly, the Judge erred in  finding
    that the Appellant's course would begin not within 28 days of expiry of
    his current leave (QI (Pakistan v SSHD [2011] EWCA  Civ  614  applied).
    Secondly, as the only reason for refusal of the Appellant's application
    was  that  his  Tier  4  Sponsor's  licence  had  been  revoked,  Patel
    (revocation of sponsor licence -  fairness)  India  [2011]  UKUT  00211
    (IAC) provided that in a case where a sponsor licence had been  revoked
    by the Secretary of State during an application for variation of  leave
    to remain and the applicant is both unaware of the revocation  and  not
    party to any reason why the licence was revoked, the Secretary of State
    should afford him a reasonable opportunity to vary the  application  by
    identifying a new sponsor before the  application  is  determined.  The
    Judge  therefore  erred  in  finding  that  there  was  no   procedural
    unfairness to the Appellant as a result of the Respondent's decision.

 4. Permission was granted on the basis that both grounds were arguable.

 5. Although the Respondent had submitted a Rule 24 response, at the outset
    of the hearing, Mr Smart quite rightly accepted that the author of  the
    Rule  24  response  had  erroneously  relied  on  QI   (para   245ZX(I)
    considered) Pakistan [2010] UKUT (IAC) and accepted, on  the  basis  of
    the Court of Appeal decision in QI, that the Judge had erred in finding
    that the Appellant would not be embarking on a  new  course  within  28
    days of expiry of his current leave (decision, para 11).

 6. In the circumstances, the  parties  agreed  that  the  appropriate  way
    forward was to allow the appeal to the limited extent that the decision
    was not in accordance with the law to enable the  Respondent  to  grant
    the required leave. This accords with the commonly accepted position of
    the Respondent, as set out in para 9 of the decision of Judge Juss.

Decision

 7. The determination of Judge Juss contains a material error of  law.  His
    decision is set aside. I remake the decision to allow the appeal to the
    limited extent  that  it  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  law.  The
    Appellant's application remains with the Respondent to  make  a  lawful
    decision by granting, as indicated by Mr Smart, the required leave.



Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to  Rule  13  of  the
Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration  and  Asylum  chamber)
Rules 2014 and I see no reason, on the facts of  this  case,  why  an  order
should be made  pursuant  to  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have considered whether to make a fee award. I have had regard to the
Joint Presidential Guidance Note: Fee Awards in Immigration Appeals
(December 2011). As the Appellant's appeal has been allowed, I make a fee
award of ï¿½140.00.
