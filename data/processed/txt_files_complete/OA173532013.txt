Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Ojukotola, S L A Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant (NT) is a citizen of Colombia and his date of birth is  3
    December 2012.  His mother, the sponsor (MT) is a citizen  of  Colombia
    with permanent residence pursuant to the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations
    2006 ("the 2006 Regulations").

2.   The appellant  made  an  application  for  entry  clearance  which  was
    refused by the ECO in a decision of 11 July 2013.

3.   The appellant appealed against the decision and the appeal was  allowed
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge Majid.  I set aside that decision  on  the
    basis that the judge made a material  error  of  law  for  the  reasons
    identified at paragraphs 9 - 12 of my decision of 13 April 2015.

         "9.  In my view the Judge made material  errors  in  his  decision.
             There is no merit in the submissions made by Mr Unigwe.  There
             was no identification by the FtT of the date of the  decision.
             There was  no  proper  assessment  of  the  appeal  under  the
             relevant Immigration Rule.  There was no  assessment  of  sole
             responsibility (which was the basis of the appellant's  case).
             In any event, there was  no  proper  assessment  of  paragraph
             297(i)(f).  It is not the case that  the  appeal  was  allowed
             under this limb of 297 in the alternative.  The judge did  not
             identify any rule  under  which  he  purported  to  allow  the
             appeal.  The assessment under  Article  8  is  inadequate  and
             insufficient.  For these reasons I set aside the  decision  of
             Judge Majid in its entirety.

         10.  It is a fact that the appellant's mother has been at some time
             legally resident in the UK and she has another son  who  is  a
             British citizen.  Her evidence is contained in a skeletal  and
             inadequate witness statement.  It is dated  20  October  2014.
             It is her evidence that she returned to Colombia when pregnant
             with the appellant and she gave birth to the appellant  there.
             It is not clear from the evidence when she returned to the UK.
              It is not clear whether she was in the UK at the date of  the
             decision.  Her evidence is that she and the appellant have  no
             contact  with  the  appellant's  father  who  is  a  Colombian
             national who lives in Chile.  The appellant's mother  returned
             to the UK, leaving the appellant with her mother  in  Colombia
             who cannot cope with him because she is elderly.

         11.  The sponsor was not at the hearing before me.  I was  informed
             by her representative that she had  returned  to  Colombia  in
             order to be with her son in March  of  this  year  and  it  is
             expected that she returns on 23 April 2015.

         12.  Mr Jarvis submitted that the matter should be remitted to  the
             First-tier Tribunal.  Mr Unigwe  did  not  have  a  view.   My
             concern is that this appeal concerns a very young child.  I am
             concerned about the history of the  case  and  the  manner  in
             which it has been managed by both parties.  There has been non-
             compliance with the directions of the FtT by the Secretary  of
             State and a failure by both parties to grapple with the issues
             in the case.  In the light of the issues I adjourned the  case
             for an oral hearing before me in the UT on 29 April 2015."

4.   I made a number of directions including  the  making  of  an  anonymity
    direction in the light of the appellant and  his  brother's  age.   The
    hearing was resumed before me on 1 July 2015.   On  this  occasion  the
    sponsor attended the hearing.  She stated  that  the  solicitors  which
    were on record, had informed her that they would be  unable  to  attend
    the hearing today.  According to the  sponsor  she  has  paid  them  to
    attend the hearing.  The usher made contact with the solicitors using a
    mobile number given to her by the sponsor.  Initially she was  informed
    that they were not aware of the hearing today and  then  she  was  told
    that a representative would attend the hearing immediately.   This  was
    11.30am.  I put the matter back in order to await the attendance of the
    appellant's solicitor once they had indicated on the telephone  to  the
    usher that a representative was on his way to Field House.   I  resumed
    the hearing at 12.20 as a representative had not attended by that time.
     The sponsor had  attended  unprepared  to  participate  fully  in  the
    proceedings without a representative.  She  sought  an  adjournment  to
    find a representative. I was of course concerned  about  the  excessive
    delay to date, but reluctantly agreed to an adjournment.  At this point
    Mr Ojukotola arrived at the hearing.  He explained that he did not have
    instructions or funds on account and was therefore unable to  represent
    the appellant.  He could not explain why the solicitors were  still  on
    record.   This  was  most  unimpressive  particularly  considering  the
    history of the case and that  it  involves  a  young  child.   However,
    considering the overriding objective (Rule 2 of the Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008), I maintained my decision to  adjourn  the
    matter.  The hearing was adjourned to 13 August 2015.

The Evidence and the Hearing

5.   The appellant relied on a bundle containing 96 documents including  the
    sponsor's witness statement of 20th of  July  2015.   In  addition  the
    sponsor submitted a letter from eldest son's school confirming  periods
    of absence as a result of visits to Colombia.

The Sponsor's Evidence

6.   The sponsor relies  on  her  witness  statement  of  28  July  2015  in
    addition she gave oral evidence at the hearing before me.  Her evidence
    can be summarised.

7.   The sponsor has permanent residence in the  UK  pursuant  to  the  2006
    Regulations.  She has an older son (AT) who is a  British  citizen  and
    his date of birth is 4 March 2009.  The father of her  two  sons  is  a
    Colombian national who is resident in Chile.  The sponsor travelled  to
    Colombia on 23 December 2011 to visit her  mother  who  was  unwell  in
    addition she had arranged to meet  the  father  of  her  eldest  child.
    During her visit the sponsor fell pregnant.  Under  pressure  from  her
    mother the sponsor married the child's father on 3 November 2012.   She
    gave birth to the appellant on 3 December 2012.  The  sponsor  and  her
    children were abandoned by her husband and father one  week  after  the
    appellant's birth.  He returned to Chile and has not had  contact  with
    them since.  He plays no role whatsoever in the life of  his  children.
    The sponsor had wanted to return to the UK before giving birth but  her
    pregnancy was classed as high risk she was not authorised to travel  by
    a doctor.  She made an application for  the  entry  clearance  for  the
    appellant on 26 March 2013 and the application was refused on  11  July
    2013.  The sponsor returned to the UK on 23 July 2013 with  her  eldest
    son leaving the appellant behind with her elderly and unwell mother.

8.   The sponsor had to return to the UK so her eldest  son  could  continue
    his education here and she was compelled to leave her youngest  son  in
    the care of her mother.  She has since travelled  to  Colombia  on  two
    occasions in order to be  with  him.   The  appellant  has  had  health
    complications since his birth and on one occasion the  sponsor  had  to
    return to Colombia because he was admitted to hospital for a week.  Her
    eldest son has had extensive periods away from school as a result.  The
    sponsor's mother's health is deteriorating and it is difficult for  her
    to take care of the appellant.

9.   Prior to travelling to  Colombia  in  December  2011  the  sponsor  was
    employed by as a housekeeper/cleaner earning �800 a month.  Whilst  she
    was in Colombia she earned the equivalent of �400 a month  from  rental
    income from a property which she owns in Colombia.  In addition she had
    savings in Colombia the equivalent of �3,800 and savings in the  UK  of
    �1,149.20.  She resumed employment as soon as she returned  to  the  UK
    and is currently earning �800 a month working as a housekeeper/cleaner.

10.  The sponsor was not legally represented when she  submitted  her  son's
    application and she thought that she needed to establish that  she  was
    earning �22,400.  At the time her son was only three months old and she
    had been abandoned by her husband.  This prompted  her  to  change  the
    date on the document from Dynamic Cleaning Ltd from 9 September 2011 to
    March 2013 in order to attempt to establish that she  was  employed  at
    that  time.   However  she  admitted  this  on  the  telephone  to  the
    respondent and apologised accordingly.

Findings and Reasons

11.  There has been considerable confusion about the date  of  the  decision
    in this case.  Mr Jarvis helpfully submitted  a  skeleton  argument  in
    accordance with directions.  It is clear to me that  the  date  of  the
    decision in this case is 11 July 2013.  Unfortunately that decision was
    not served on the appellant until 30 January 2014.  The wrong  decision
    was served on  the  appellant  and  to  exacerbate  the  confusion  the
    appellant's own solicitors have attached  the  wrong  decision  to  the
    notice of appeal and have previously referred to  it  as  the  relevant
    decision.  The ECO refused the application pursuant to 297 (1) (e)  and
    (iv) of the Immigration Rules ("the Rules").  It was also concluded the
    sponsor had tried to mislead the ECO by changing the date of employment
    in a letter and it was concluded that the company for which she  stated
    she worked was not contactable and there was  no  record  of  it.   The
    tenancy agreement that the sponsor submitted is dated 2004 and as  such
    could not be relied upon in support of the  application.   It  was  not
    accepted that the sponsor has sole  responsibility  of  the  appellant.
    The Entry Clearance Manager who reviewed the decision maintained it  in
    a decision of 18 March 2014.

12.  I had the benefit of hearing the  sponsor  gave  oral  evidence  and  I
    found her to be  credible.   I  accept  her  evidence.   There  was  no
    significant challenge to it made by Mr Walker.  I  take  on  board  the
    issues raised by the ECO and will deal with these.

13.  The Secretary of State relies on  paragraph  320  (7A)  of  the  Rules.
    There was no explicit reference to this  in  the  Reasons  for  Refusal
    Letter, but deception was clearly raised as an issue.   The  respondent
    has since made it clear in Mr Jarvis' skeleton  argument  of  21  April
    2015 that paragraph 320(7A) in issue.  Mr Ojukotola submitted that  the
    respondent's decision to rely on 320 (7A) is  not  in  accordance  with
    respondent's policy, but he was not able to submit or properly identify
    the relevant policy of IDIs on which he relied.  It is obvious that the
    document in question is a false documents and that it was submitted  by
    the sponsor as opposed  to  the  appellant  is  not  material  for  the
    purposes paragraph 320 (7A).  When  the  sponsor  was  interviewed  she
    admitted having tampered  with  a  document  and  having  submitted  in
    support of the application because she could not meet  the  maintenance
    requirement of the Rules.  In  accordance  with  AA  (Nigeria)  v  SSHD
    [2010] EWCA Civ 773, it is clear to me that paragraph 320 (7A)  of  the
    Rules is engaged in this case which results in a mandatory refusal.

14.  It follows that  the  appellant  would  not  be  able  to  satisfy  the
    requirements of paragraph 297 of the Rules because he falls for refusal
    under the general grounds for refusal (297(vii)).  However, in my  view
    the appellant has established that 297(i)(e) of the Rules is satisfied.
     At the date of the application and the decision on any account,  I  am
    satisfied that the sponsor had sole responsibility for  the  appellant.
    I accept her evidence that she had effectively been  abandoned  by  his
    father.  At the date of the decision she was still in Colombia.  In any
    event, having accepted the sponsor's evidence I also conclude  that  in
    this  case  there  are  serious  and   compelling   family   or   other
    considerations which make exclusion of the child undesirable  and  that
    he would therefore satisfy 297(i)(f).  I reach this conclusion based on
    the appellant's age.  He was three  months  old  at  the  date  of  the
    application and six months old at the date of the decision and this  in
    itself  amounts  to  a  serious  and  compelling  consideration.    The
    arrangement that he was to be cared  for  by  his  elderly  and  unwell
    grandmother was clearly  meant  as  a  temporary  arrangement.   It  is
    obvious in this case that the  best  interests  of  the  appellant  are
    served by being with his mother.  I have had particular regard  to  the
    decision in Mundeba (s.55 and para 297(i) (f)) Democratic  Republic  of
    Congo [2013] UKUT 00088, but will expand on this in relation to Article
    8.

15.  I next turn to the issue of accommodation and maintenance  pursuant  to
    paragraph 297(iv) of the Rules.  The sponsor's evidence is that at  the
    time of the decision she was living in her own house in  Colombia  with
    her mother and her sons.  There  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  the
    accommodation which she described in evidence was not adequate.

16.  Mr Ojukotola submitted a document  which  was  entitled  "Benefits  and
    Pension Rates" which appeared to have been issued by the Department for
    Work and Pensions in April 2013.   He  asserted  on  reliance  of  that
    document that the income support level for a lone  parent  aged  18  or
    over was �72.40 and he submitted that it may be that a  family  premium
    of �17.45 should be included.  In order to establish  that  maintenance
    is adequate and applicant needs to show that  the  resources  available
    will meet or exceed the relevant income support level set by the United
    Kingdom government KA (Pakistan) [2006] UKAIT  00065.   In  calculating
    the level of resources that will be  available  to  the  appellant  and
    family members it is  based  on  the  position  after  the  appellant's
    hypothetical arrival  in  the  United  Kingdom.   An  appellant  in  an
    immigration appeal must be able to demonstrate either that  the  actual
    financial position on arrival will be such as to make it unnecessary to
    rely on benefits in order to provide a standard of living equivalent to
    that available on means tested  benefits  or  that  there  will  be  no
    additional recourse to public funds  in  so  relying  (Yarce  (adequate
    maintenance: benefits) [2012] UKUT 00425).  The appellant  carries  the
    legal burden of proving that he meets the relevant requirements of  the
    Rules.  The sponsor's evidence is that when she returned to the UK  she
    resumed work immediately. However the fact is that at the date  of  the
    decision she was unemployed.  Considering the adequacy  of  maintenance
    on the basis of the hypothetical situation  (see  above),  the  sponsor
    would be returning to the UK with  her  two  sons  without  employment.
    However, I accept that she had property in Colombia which gave  her  an
    income that would be available on arrival plus modest  savings.   There
    was no challenge to this evidence by Mr Walker.  On balance, I find the
    appellant is able to satisfy the maintenance requirement of the Rules.

17.  The problem for the appellant is that he cannot satisfy  paragraph  297
    of the Rules because he falls for refusal under the general grounds  of
    refusal.  In these circumstances I must consider the case under Article
    8.

18.  In relation to Article  8  it  is  obvious  that  the  issue  turns  on
    proportionality and this must be considered in  the  light  of  Section
    117B of the 2002 Act.  Having found that paragraph 297 (i) (e) and  (f)
    are satisfied it follows in my view that the appeal should  be  allowed
    under Article 8.  I have had regard to the  case  of  Mundeba  and  the
    findings of the UT that where an immigration decision engages Article 8
    rights, due regard must be had to the UN Convention on  the  Rights  of
    the Child.  An entry clearance decision for the admission  of  a  child
    under 18 is an action concerning children undertaken by  administrative
    authorities.  At the date of the decision it  was  in  the  appellant's
    best interests to be with his mother and brother here in the UK.   This
    remains the case.  The appellant's brother is a British  citizen.   The
    evidence is insufficient to establish that it is in his best  interests
    to remain here in the UK, but it is obvious that his best interests are
    served by remaining with his mother  and  for  the  family  not  to  be
    fragmented.  In addition that he is  a  British  citizen  is  a  strong
    pointer to the fact that his future lies in  the  UK.   I  accept  that
    should the appeal be dismissed the result would be that  in  order  for
    the family to be together the sponsor and  her  British  citizen  child
    would have to leave the UK.  Should the sponsor decide to  remain  here
    for the sake of her eldest son, the family would remain fragmented  and
    the young appellant without his mother.  In relation to  the  sponsor's
    wrong doing, in  a  way  that  undermines  the  system  of  immigration
    control, is a factor which weighs strongly in the respondent's  favour,
    but the children are blameless.  I have taken  into  account  that  the
    sponsor intended to return  to  the  UK  before  giving  birth  to  the
    appellant but was not able to on the advice of a  doctor  in  Colombia.
    I also take into account that when the sponsor  made  the  application,
    the appellant was only three months old and she  had  effectively  been
    abandoned by her husband.

19.  The maintenance of immigration control is in the public interest.   The
    sponsor has been dishonest.  However, the family was at the date of the
    decision and continues to be self-supporting.  This is the case whether
    or  not  I  am  correct  about  297(iv).   The  sponsor  asked  for  an
    interpreter  at  the  substantive  hearing,  but  she   spoke   English
    adequately at the hearing before me on the last occasion.  She had been
    working in the UK before the date of the decision and was and is by any
    account integrated.  Her status is  neither  unlawful  nor  precarious.
    She had at the date of the  decision  permanent  residence  here  which
    continues. In my view the  balance  tips  strongly  in  favour  of  the
    appellant in this case and the appeal is allowed under  Article  8.   I
    note that there has been  significant  delay  caused  by  a  number  of
    factors in this  case.   Initially  the  respondent  issued  the  wrong
    decision to the appellant and that the sponsor  may  have  been  poorly
    served by her solicitors.  In any event, the appellant  is  very  young
    and entirely blameless.

20.  The appeal is allowed.  In  these  circumstances  I  take  the  unusual
    course of action and direct pursuant to section 87 (1) of the 2002  Act
    to direct the ECO to give effect to this decision forthwith.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
