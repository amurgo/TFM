For the Appellants: Professor Rees (Counsel)
For the Respondent: Mrs Ahmad (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Appellants' appeal  against  the  decision  of  Designated
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Zucker promulgated on the 7th December 2015,
      in which he dismissed the Appellants' appeal against the  Respondent's
      decision to cancel the First Appellant's leave.

   2. The First Appellant had leave which had been granted  until  the  28th
      January 2015, but this was cancelled by the Respondent, when the First
      Appellant, who had been overseas, returned to the UK with  the  Second
      Appellant whom he had recently married.  The Second Appellant's  claim
      is dependent upon the First Appellant.  Leave  was  cancelled  by  the
      Respondent under Paragraph 321A of the Immigration Rules, on the basis
      that when the First Appellant had  previously  applied  for  leave  in
      2010, the First Appellant had relied upon 3  invoices  submitted  with
      the application for work he claims that he had undertaken work  for  a
      company called IT Verticals Limited.  When  the  First  Appellant  had
      initially made his application for  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
      Kingdom as a Tier 1 (general) migrant, on or about  the  28th  January
      2010, he gave 2 sources of income, the first  was  from  A3D2  Limited
      trading as "Tiger Tiger" in which he is said to have earned �14,327.30
      and in addition he claimed self-employed earnings in respect  of  work
      which he is said to  have  undertaken  for  IT  Verticals  Limited  in
      respect of which he claimed to have earned �8,000. Reliance was placed
      by the Respondent upon a forensic accountant's report which had stated
      that IT Verticals Limited had not actively  traded  but  was  a  shell
      company and therefore the Respondent found that  the  First  Appellant
      had not disclosed, when seeking to extend his leave in  January  2013,
      that the previous earlier application in 2010  had  been  obtained  in
      reliance on the submission of  a  false  document  or  representation.
      Leave was cancelled under Paragraph 321A and  he  and  his  wife  were
      refused leave back into the United Kingdom and it was said that future
      applications would automatically  fall  for  refusal  under  Paragraph
      320(7b) of the Immigration Rules.

   3. The Appellants' appeal  came  before  Designated  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Zucker at North Shields on the 26th November 2015.

   4. In his decision, Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge Zucker found the
      First Appellant to be "a wholly dishonest  witness"  and  stated  that
      "Having regard to all of the evidence I am left in no doubt whatsoever
      that the First Appellant was involved  in  the  churning  of  cash  as
      contended for by the Respondent and that he  will  knew  that  he  was
      engaged in a dishonest activity.   It  is  hardly  necessary  to  look
      further than the production, at  the  eleventh  hour,  of  the  emails
      purporting to  be  from  Deepanshu  Motani  stating  in  the  clearest
      possible terms that the monies about which he was questioned were  for
      loans, when in answering questions to Mr Dewison he  could  not  quite
      recall and had to speculate".  The First-tier Tribunal Judge found  at
      [59] that "I repeat I found  the  First  Appellant  to  be  thoroughly
      dishonest both in the evidence that he gave to me and in the scheme in
      which he was clearly involved".  He dismissed the Appellants'  appeals
      for the reasons set out within the decision.

   5. The Appellants have now sought to appeal against that decision for the
      reasons set out within the Grounds of Appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
      Permission to appeal was initially refused by the First-tier  Tribunal
      by Designed First-tier Tribunal Judge Philips on the 23rd March  2016.



   6. Within the Grounds of Appeal to the Upper Tribunal  directly,  it  was
      argued by the Appellant, inter alia, that although the Respondent  had
      said that cancellation of his leave as a Tier 1 (general) migrant  was
      appropriate because invoices submitted  with  the  application  giving
      rise to it had been obtained from IT Verticals Limited, which was said
      to be a company which had been shown by a forensic accountant's report
      to have been a shell  company  rather  than  one  which  had  actively
      traded, and that its sole purpose had been to generate invoices  which
      might have been used by migrants wishing to extend their leave but who
      fell short of the minimum relevant income threshold,  the  Appellant's
      case in response was that he  had  indeed  worked  with  IT  Verticals
      Limited and that it had actively traded, at least to the  extent  that
      he had provided IT services for it, for services totalling �8,000,  by
      way of trading materials and marketing. He claims the  work  had  been
      conducted pursuant to a memorandum which he had only  ever  stored  by
      email and which was now inaccessible to him given  that  more  than  6
      years had passed.

   7. Three Grounds of Appeal were argued.   Firstly,  it  was  argued  that
      there had been a lawful approach to similar fact evidence and that the
      Judge  had  erred  in  admitting  evidence  of  transactions  with  IT
      Verticals from third parties that were produced by  the  Secretary  of
      State "only shortly before the hearing - the more so  given  that,  as
      shown by the FTT decision at [62] onwards, the FTT declined  to  admit
      evidence sought to be adduced by A (notwithstanding that R's  evidence
      was admitted when itself in breach  of  directions".   It  was  argued
      within the Grounds of Appeal that  the  Judge  should  have  taken  an
      approach analogous to that set out in  respect  of  civil  proceedings
      summarised by the High Court in the case of Hegazy and  Others  v  The
      Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [2014] EWHC 235 (QB) and that
      the first step was to determine  legal  admissibility,  for  which  it
      would qualify only if it is potentially  relevant,  and  that  at  the
      second  stage  a  number  of  factors  would  need  to  be  considered
      including, the probative value of the  material  in  relation  to  the
      issues on which it is to be admitted, having  regard  to  the  overall
      importance in the case as a whole,  and  also  having  regard  to  any
      prejudice occasioned to any other party. It is  said  that  if  it  is
      accepted that the evidence gives rise to unfair  prejudice,  then  its
      probative  value  will  have  to  outweigh  that   prejudice   'by   a
      considerable margin' in order to justify its admittance.  It is argued
      that whilst principles of evidence in civil proceedings do not  direct
      carry  over  into  immigration  appeals,  they  must  nevertheless  be
      relevant and that the test is whether or not  the  report's  probative
      value outweighed the prejudicial effect was not expressly  applied  by
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

   8. In the second ground of  appeal  it  is  argued  that  the  First-tier
      Tribunal erred in law  in  simply  accepting  the  evidence  from  the
      Respondent  by  way  of  the  forensic   accountant   report   without
      considering the extent  to  which  that  report  measured  up  to  the
      requirements for expert evidence set out Practice Direction 10,  which
      requires a party seeking to rely upon  such  material  to  reveal  the
      precise terms of their instructions to the expert,  and  demands  that
      the report  earn  the  weight  normally  afforded  expert  opinion  by
      indicating the extent to which  matters  within  the  report  writer's
      knowledge  detract  from  their   conclusions   and   indicate   their
      appreciation of their duty to the Court.  It was said  that  this  was
      patently unfair given that  it  is  well  known  that  in  immigration
      proceedings allegedly 'expert' evidence  will  always  be  subject  to
      scrutiny to ensure that its purported  expertise  matches  up  to  its
      substantive content.

   9. In the third ground  of  appeal  it  is  argued  that  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge failed to take account of  relevant  considerations  in
      terms of it is said that the First-tier Tribunal  overlooked  evidence
      given by the Appellant orally that he had lived with  many  people  at
      the student house in 2009 or 2010 and could not remember all of  their
      names, and secondly that at [55] and [67] the First-tier Tribunal held
      it against  the  Appellant  that  he  did  not  produce  corroborative
      evidence that might have been available without directing itself  that
      the burden of proof is on the Secretary of State in leave cancellation
      cases.

  10. Permission to appeal had been granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Allen on
      the 28th June 2016, in which he found  that  "Although  the  rules  of
      evidence  in  civil  proceedings  are  not  directly   applicable   to
      proceedings  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  it  is  arguable,  as
      contended in the grounds, that they are nevertheless relevant, and the
      point has potential materiality in this case.  I also accept there  is
      potential challenge in ground  2  in  the  approach  to  the  forensic
      accountant's report, although I see less weight in the third ground  I
      do not rule it out".

  11. Within the Rule 24 Reply dated the 21st July 2016, it was stated  that
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge had directed himself  appropriately  and
      that in a comprehensive determination the Judge had considered all  of
      the evidence presented and on analysis of that evidence had  concluded
      by adequate reasoning  that  the  Appellant  was  a  wholly  dishonest
      witness.  It is said that it is not clear how the evidence  which  the
      Appellant wished to have adduced could  materially  have  altered  the
      Judge's findings and that it was for the Judge to place weight on  the
      evidence produced as appropriate and that there was no  evidence  that
      the Judge had failed to consider any of the  evidence  presented.   It
      was argued that there is no merit in the Grounds of Appeal and that no
      material errors of law are established.

  12. It was on that basis that  the  case  came  before  me  in  the  Upper
      Tribunal.




   Oral Submissions

  13. In his oral submissions on behalf of  the  Appellants  Professor  Rees
      submitted, inter alia, that the First Appellant  strongly  denied  any
      dishonesty on his part and contended that IT Verticals Limited was not
      a shell  company  and  he  had  actively  traded  with  that  company.
      Professor Rees agreed that in fact the accounting report  relied  upon
      by the Respondent was not similar fact  evidence,  but  he  sought  to
      argue that it was analogous to similar fact evidence  and  should  not
      have been admitted.  He sought to argue that the annexes to the report
      were only produced to the First-tier  Tribunal  30  minutes  into  the
      hearing, and that to allow the evidence in at that  stage  was  unfair
      and that the evidence  on  the  accounting  report  should  have  been
      excluded.  He sought to argue that the initial hearing in October 2015
      had been adjourned as the annexes had not been produced to  the  Court
      and that there had been an order by the Tribunal indicating  that  the
      documents were to be served by the 6th November.  He argued  that  the
      Respondent had provided 42 annexes, and that  the  Appellant  had  not
      been named in the annexes and that by handing  up  this  documentation
      half an hour after the start of the hearing, in breach of  directions,
      was unfair.  He argued  that  the  Appellants,  although  he  had  not
      represented  them  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  had  asked  for  an
      adjournment, but that an adjournment had not been granted. However, he
      said that the Appellants had not pushed  for  an  adjournment  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal hearing, but had asked for one.  He conceded  that
      it was not a pleaded ground for appeal, that the Judge had refused  an
      adjournment.

  14. Professor Rees then sought to argue that there were problems with  the
      forensic accountancy report itself, in that, for instance, within  the
      instructions given to the authors of  the  report  it  was  stated  at
      paragraph 1.2(v) that they were to prepare  a  report  "to  show  that
      Verticals and other companies were a  sham"  and  that  therefore  the
      report was not independent.  He further  argued  that  the  report  at
      paragraph 2.8.7 named 17 individuals who had been established as  Tier
      1 individuals, but only 3 had paid cash deposits to the  company.   He
      further argued that there was said to be  11  named  individuals  paid
      through IT Verticals, who were not Tier 1  applicants,  and  that  the
      Appellant had not been named as one of the individuals  and  that  far
      too much weight was given to the report  in  circumstances  where  the
      Appellant was not named as an individual and that the wording  of  the
      report indicated that there was  a  high  degree  of  supposition  and
      conjecture.  Professor Rees argued that the invoices provided  by  the
      Appellant in 2010 were in order and that  they  did  contain  a  phone
      number and email address and that each invoice had a number.   It  was
      further submitted that the Appellant had  problems  with  the  Judge's
      finding that the First Appellant was wholly  dishonest.   However,  he
      conceded that "perversity" had not been argued as a ground of  appeal.



  15. Professor Rees further argued that although he was not  aware  of  any
      specific case which meant that decisions in respect of  cases  in  the
      civil  jurisdiction  should   be   imported   into   the   immigration
      jurisdiction, under the First-tier Tribunal  Procedure  Rules,  Judges
      had to deal with cases justly and fairly, when applying the Overriding
      Objective.

  16. Professor Rees further argued that in respect of the third  ground  of
      appeal, the First Appellant could name the people he lived  with,  but
      not the years, and the Judge had made a  mistake  in  respect  of  his
      findings at [54] of the decision.  When I pointed out to him that this
      is contrary to what is was argued within the Grounds  of  Appeal  that
      the Appellant could not remember the names  of  the  people  he  lived
      within in 2009/2010 in the Grounds of Appeal,  Professor  Rees  argued
      that the First Appellant could in fact remember the names.   Professor
      Rees then argued that the Judge had not specifically stated  that  the
      burden of proof in cancellation cases was on  the  Respondent  in  his
      findings at paragraphs [54] and [55] and also at [67] and that, in his
      submission, the Judge had shifted the burden of proof.  He argued that
      although having  mentioned  that  the  burden  of  proof  was  on  the
      Respondent earlier in the decision, the Judge should  have  reiterated
      the same, when making his findings.

  17. In her oral submissions, Mrs Ahmad took me to the  provisions  of  the
      Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum
      Chamber) Rules 2014 and argued that in respect of ground 1, under Rule
      3 of the Procedure Rules the Judge could extend  time  for  compliance
      with any rule or direction, and even if there had been  a  failure  to
      comply with a rule or direction, under Rule 6.2, the Judge could waive
      the requirement.  She further argued that  under  Rule  14.2  a  Judge
      could admit evidence whether or not that evidence would be  admissible
      in a civil trial and she argued that the Judge had power to allow  the
      evidence, which he did and that he was entitled to  do  so  under  the
      Rules.

  18. Mrs Ahmad further argued that at [10] the Judge had clearly given  the
      Appellants the opportunity  to  apply  for  an  adjournment  when  the
      further evidence had  been  submitted  and  that  the  Appellants  had
      declined the opportunity for an adjournment.

  19. In respect of ground 2, she argued that  the  Practice  Direction  had
      been complied with in that the instructions were set  out  within  the
      report, as were the statement of compliance and  statement  of  truth,
      that the weight to be attached to the report  was  a  matter  for  the
      First-tier Tribunal Judge and that any argument  regarding  perversity
      had not been argued within the Grounds of Appeal.

  20. In respect of the third ground of appeal Mrs  Ahmad  argued  that  the
      Judge had clearly taken account of the evidence of the  Appellant  and
      his statement, and given clear reasons as to  why  he  had  found  the
      First Appellant to be  dishonest.   She  argued  that  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge had fully set out the burden of proof and the fact that
      it was on the Respondent at [7] and [9] and that he did  not  need  to
      repeat the burden of proof when making his findings.




   My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

  21. In respect of the first ground of appeal, I do not consider  that  the
      forensic accountant's report relied upon by the Respondent amounted to
      "similar fact evidence" or was  in  fact  analogous  to  similar  fact
      evidence.  Similar fact evidence arises when the Court or Tribunal  is
      being asked to consider evidence about  the  circumstances  and  facts
      surrounding a previous event, which is said to show  a  propensity  to
      act in a similar way on a future occasion.  For example,  in  criminal
      proceedings, the prosecution will often seek to rely upon evidence  of
      previous burglaries carried out by a  burglar  with  a  certain  modus
      operandi, in order to establish that a subsequent burglary carried out
      in the same manner, was perpetrated by the  accused.   However,  here,
      the evidence  regarding  the  forensic  accountant's  report  and  the
      activities of IT Verticals Limited, is not similar  fact  evidence  in
      terms of it being relating to previous activities of the company or of
      the Appellant, but was relied upon by the Respondent as evidence  that
      in fact IT Verticals Limited had never traded and was a shell company,
      which had never actively traded and whose sole purpose was to generate
      invoices that might be used by migrants wishing to extend their leave,
      but who fell short of the relevant income requirement threshold.

  22. Far from being similar fact  evidence,  this  was  evidence  going  to
      counter the assertion by the Appellant that  he  had  traded  with  IT
      Verticals Limited and they had actively traded and that  the  invoices
      he produced previously were genuine.  The Respondent  was  seeking  to
      argue that IT Verticals Limited had  never  actively  traded  and  had
      always been a shell company whose sole reason was  to  generate  false
      invoices to be  used  by  migrants  wishing  to  falsely  boost  their
      purported levels of income.  In such circumstances, the  test  in  the
      civil jurisdiction for similar fact evidence, as to whether or not the
      probative  value  of  the  evidence   significantly   outweighed   the
      prejudicial effect before it would be admissible, was not relevant and
      did not have to be quoted  by  Designated  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Zucker, given the evidence regarding the forensic accountant's  report
      went directly to the question  in  issue  as  to  whether  or  not  IT
      Verticals Limited had actively ever traded, or was a shell company and
      therefore went directly  to  the  issue  as  to  whether  or  not  the
      Appellant's invoices were genuine.

  23. However, in any event, Professor Rees was unable to point  me  to  any
      authority for the proposition that  the  provision  regarding  similar
      fact evidence in the case law of Hegazy, should be  incorporated  into
      immigration law.  In this regard, under Rule  14(2)  of  the  Tribunal
      Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules
      2014, the Tribunal may admit evidence  whether  or  not  the  evidence
      would be admissible in a civil trial in the United Kingdom.  The Judge
      therefore had the  power  to  admit  the  evidence  under  that  Rule,
      irrespective as to whether or not it was  similar  fact  evidence  and
      whether or not the probative value outweighed the  prejudicial  effect
      and providing that the decision  was  taken  in  accordance  with  the
      Overriding Objective to deal with cases fairly and justly.

  24.  In that regard, the First-tier Tribunal Judge also  had  power  under
      his case management powers under Rule 4, to extend or shorten the time
      for comply with any Rule, Practice Direction or  direction  and  power
      under Rule 6(2) in circumstances where a party had  failed  to  comply
      with a requirement in the Rules, Practice Direction or a direction, to
      take such  action  as  it  considered  just,  including  "waiving  the
      requirement".

  25.  In such circumstances, Designated First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Zucker
      was perfectly within his discretion to admit the forensic accountant's
      report in this case and the annexes which were sought  to  be  relied,
      even in circumstances where the annexes were  sought  to  be  produced
      half an hour into the hearing, as alleged by Professor Rees.  In  that
      regard, Designed First-tier Tribunal Judge Zucker at [10]  had  stated
      that "There had been directions  given  on  an  earlier  occasion  for
      documentation relating to the report to be filed and served  and  that
      he is right to observe the Respondent had been late in the  supply  of
      those documents and therefore in breach of directions.   It  was  also
      the case of some correspondence the Respondent had by letter dated 2nd
      November 2015 said that the Appellant's name did not appear in any  of
      the documentation attaching to the report, whereas in  fact  his  name
      now did  appear.   However,  while  I  note  the  point  taken  by  Ms
      Parasoidy, it did not really take the  matter  any  further.   It  was
      apparent that there was no issue that the Appellant had  had  dealings
      with IT Verticals and through Ms Parasoidy was asked, after the matter
      had been stood down for her to consider her position if  she  required
      an adjournment but she declined the opportunity saying  that  she  was
      content to proceed. "

  26.   In  such  circumstances,  in  my  judgement,  Designated  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Zucker acted perfectly fairly, when deciding  to  admit
      the evidence in the interests of justice, albeit late, by standing the
      matter down so that the Appellants could consider  the  position,  and
      specifically asking whether or not she wished an adjournment in  light
      of the evidence that had been submitted  late.  That  opportunity  was
      refused  by  the  Appellants'  Counsel.   In  such  circumstances  the
      decision by the First-tier Tribunal Judge was in no way in  breach  of
      the Rules, and in my judgement,  Designed  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Zucker acted perfectly fairly and reasonably in that regard.

  27. Although it is argued that the evidence should not have  been  allowed
      in when the Judge had failed to allow in further evidence on behalf of
      the Appellants, in that regard, I  note  from  [62]  to  [68]  of  the
      judgement, that the Appellants sought to adduce post-hearing evidence,
      after the decision had been dictated and sent to typing by  Designated
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Zucker on the 27th November  2015,  the  day
      after the hearing, a letter which was received at the Tribunal on  the
      30th  November  2015  from  the  Appellants'   solicitors   requesting
      permission to adduce further evidence, namely the  international  bank
      account statement.  Judge Zucker  perfectly  properly  considered  the
      test for admission of post-hearing evidence under the test set out  in
      the case of Ladd v Marshall [1954] 1WLR 1489 and took  the  view  that
      that evidence was  available  at  least  at  the  time  of  the  first
      corresponding entries in the UK bank statements and that  he  did  not
      accept that the Appellants would not have appreciated  that  questions
      concerning the movement of funds would not have  been  asked.  In  any
      event he considered that it was virtually impossible to say  that  the
      international accounts would have had any influence on the case  given
      what he considered to be the many reasons he had for disbelieving  the
      First Appellant on the consideration of the evidence,  which  was  not
      dependent at  all  upon  the  production  of  the  international  bank
      account.  The Judge was therefore properly entitled to not  admit  the
      post-hearing evidence sought to be relied upon by the Appellants,  but
      to admit the evidence sought to be relied upon in terms of the further
      annexes by the Respondent, during the course of the hearing itself.

  28. In respect of the second ground of appeal, in which it is argued  that
      the Judge adopted an unlawful approach to the Respondent's evidence in
      terms of simply accepting the evidence from the Respondent in  respect
      of the forensic accountant's report without considering the extent  to
      which the report complied with the requirements  for  expert  evidence
      set out in Practice Direction 10, it is clear, having considered  that
      report, that in fact the instructions to the expert were  set  out  at
      page 1 of the report under the instructions section, and that  at  the
      end of the report the report did contain both  a  statement  of  truth
      which was signed by the report's authors and a statement of compliance
      in terms of their understanding of their duties as expert witnesses to
      the Court and a statement that they had complied with  that  duty  and
      that the report included all matters relevant to the issues  on  which
      their expert evidence was given. The experts  stated  they  had  given
      details in the report of any matters which might affect  the  validity
      of the report, addressed the report to the Court and  said  that  they
      had made clear that the facts stated in the report were  within  their
      knowledge and that they  believed  them  to  be  true,  and  that  the
      opinions expressed represented their true  and  complete  professional
      opinions.  The declarations in the report and  details  given  of  the
      instructions, in my judgement, therefore were  sufficient  to  satisfy
      Practice Direction 10 in that regard. In any event,  it  was  open  to
      Judge Zucker under the Procedure Rules, to waive compliance with  that
      Practice Direction, if it was in the interests of justice  to  do  so.
      However, in my judgement there was no breach of Practice Direction 10,
      as suggested within the Grounds of Appeal.

  29. Although Professor Rees has sought to argue that the report  from  its
      wording appeared to be based upon supposition and that a complaint was
      raised that within the report the First Appellant was  not  named  and
      that within the report 17 individuals were named as  Tier  1  migrants
      only 3 of whom had paid cash deposits to the company IT Verticals, and
      that there  were  11  named  individuals  who  were  paid  through  IT
      Verticals who were not Tier 1 applicants,  these  were  not  arguments
      which were specifically raised within the Grounds of Appeal,  and  did
      not simply amount to elaborating upon  the  grounds  as  suggested  by
      Professor Rees, in terms of what was said to be the unlawful  approach
      of the Respondent's evidence. The argument as pleaded  simply  related
      to whether or not the Practice Direction had been complied  with,  not
      complaints regarding the other contents of the report.

  30.  Professor Rees did not seek leave to amend the Grounds of  Appeal  in
      this regard, and as leave has not been granted to make such arguments,
      they cannot be relied upon by the Appellants.  However, even if  I  am
      wrong in that regard, in my judgement, the further  arguments  in  any
      event simply go to the weight to be attached to the report, and in the
      absence of perversity, which has not been argued within the Grounds of
      Appeal the question as to weight to be attached to the  expert  report
      was a matter for the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

  31. In respect of the third ground of appeal in which it  is  argued  that
      the Judge failed to take account of the evidence of the  Appellant  in
      making his findings at [54] that the evidence  of  the  Appellant  was
      that he had lived with many people at the student  home  in  2009  and
      2010 and could not remember all their names,  the  Judge  clearly  had
      taken account of that evidence at [35]  where  he  stated  "The  First
      Appellant went on to tell me that where he lived was a student  house.
      He could not remember exactly who he lived with  because  people  came
      and went but he did remember 2 brothers whose surnames were Motani and
      he gave the names of some others".  The Judge  therefore  has  clearly
      taken account of the Appellant's evidence, as he has recorded the same
      specifically, when recounting the evidence the Appellant gave in cross-
      examination.

  32.  In any event, the Judge's findings at [54] related to whether or  not
      the First Appellant with his limited income without  more  explanation
      would have lent �2,400 to Mr Motani, as a housemate, in  circumstances
      where the First-tier Tribunal Judge found that the First Appellant was
      very keen for the Judge to understand that these were not  people  who
      were good friends, so as to explain why he did not know the extent  to
      which they were involved with IT Verticals, but yet at the  same  time
      would  have  the  Judge  believe  that  he  was  lending  this  person
      substantial amounts of money.  He went on  to  state  at  [54]  "Still
      further, this was a man who would have  me  believe  that  he  was  so
      concerned to ensure that he documentary  proof  of  the  repayment  of
      monies that he would pay cash through his bank accounts to  record  it
      yet did not have any sufficient evidence of loans, which I say bearing
      in mind the eleventh hour document production.".  The Judge  therefore
      did not have to take into account, specifically, the evidence  of  the
      Appellant regarding whether he could remember the names of the  people
      he lived with, in making his findings  regarding  whether  or  not  he
      would have loaned money to Mr Motani at [54].

  33. In respect of the further argument in  ground  3  of  the  Grounds  of
      Appeal that the Judge held it against the Appellant that  he  did  not
      produce corroborative evidence that might have been available  without
      directing himself that the burden of proof was on  the  Respondent  in
      leave cancellation cases, I find that the  Judge  clearly  did  direct
      himself both in paragraphs [7] and [9] of the decision that the burden
      of proof was on the Respondent. Indeed, he went further and found that
      it was not sufficient for it to be shown to the  civil  standard  that
      false representations or false documents  were  relied  upon  but  the
      Respondent must also demonstrate to a civil standard  that  there  had
      been dishonesty at [7].  The Judge further  noted  that  "The  various
      cases point to a standard of proof being the balance of probabilities,
      but where there is a serious allegation, the evidence must  be  cogent
      and the more serious the allegation the more cogent must the  evidence
      be".

  34. At [55]  Designated  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Zucker  specifically
      stated that "The First Appellant told me  that  he  had  attempted  to
      retrieve email accounts  which  evidenced  these  loans,  but  in  the
      context of the evidence as a whole I simply do  not  believe  him.   I
      observed that if Deepanshu Motani was in fact in  the  United  Kingdom
      then it  is  surprising  that  the  First  Appellant  who  thought  it
      important enough to obtain the document from him,  did  not  think  it
      important enough either to tell his Counsel of that evidence or indeed
      invite Mr Motani to come to  the  Tribunal  and  give  evidence.   The
      absence  of  evidence  which  might  easily  have  been  provided   in
      circumstances in which there is no adequate explanation for  it  is  a
      factor to which I can have regard and indeed I specifically  mentioned
      the case of TK (Burundi)  v  The  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2009] EWCA Civ 40 to Ms Parasoidy in  the  course  of  her
      submissions after the document was produced in order to give  her  the
      opportunity  to  make  any  representation   she   might   have   felt
      appropriate".

  35. In this regard, the Judge clearly did have in mind the burden of proof
      being on the Respondent, as he had clearly set that out  early  within
      his judgement, and he did not, having already set it out  twice,  have
      to reiterate the fact that the burden of proof was on  the  Respondent
      at paragraph [55] or at paragraph [67] as claimed.  However, the Judge
      was entitled to take into account, even though the burden was  on  the
      Respondent, the fact  that  evidence  which  might  easily  have  been
      provided in circumstances in which there was no  adequate  explanation
      for its absence. This was a factor which he could take  into  account.
      There was no error of law or unfairness in  the  way  that  Designated
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Zucker dealt with that issue.

  36. In such circumstances, having carefully  considered  the  decision  of
      Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge Zucker, I find that the  decision
      does not reveal any material error of law  and  does  not  reveal  any
      procedural  unfairness  amounting  to  an  error  of  law.   In   such
      circumstances the decision of  Designated  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Zucker is maintained, and I dismiss the Appellants' appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision  of  Designated  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Zucker  does  not
contain any material error  of  law  and  does  not  reveal  any  procedural
unfairness.  The decision of Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge Zucker  is
therefore maintained.

Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge  Zucker  did  not  make  any  anonymity
direction in this case  and  there  was  no  submission  that  an  anonymity
direction was appropriate.  I therefore do not make any anonymity  direction
in this case.
