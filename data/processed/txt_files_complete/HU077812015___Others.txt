                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. I reached a decision on whether there was an error of  law  in  the
         First-tier Tribunal's decision following a  hearing  at  the  Royal
         Courts of Justice on 29th July 2019 as follows:

             ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

             "1.  Kamala Kandel and  Bhojraj  Kandel  are  the  mother  and
             father respectively of  Kiran  Kandel[1]  and  Kabita  Kandel.
             Kiran's date of birth is 27 November 1996 and he was  thus  an
             adult when he made his human rights claim;  Kabita's  date  of
             birth is 2nd May 1999 and she was a minor when  she  made  her
             human rights claim and a minor when it was refused and a minor
             on the date of the First-tier Tribunal hearing.

             2.   The appellants'  human  rights  claims  were  refused  in
             separate decisions by the respondent for reasons  set  out  in
             decisions dated 25th  September  2015.   All  four  appellants
             submitted separate appeals, but they were linked  for  hearing
             because they are a family.

             3.   Their appeals were dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge
             Malcolm for reasons set out in a decision promulgated  on  5th
             July 2017 (incorrectly endorsed as  promulgated  on  5th  June
             2019). Permission to appeal was sought by each  appellant  and
             refused first by the First-tier Tribunal and then by the Upper
             Tribunal. An application for permission to  judicially  review
             the decision of the Upper Tribunal was sought and  granted  by
             Sir  Stephen  Silber  and  the  Upper  Tribunal  then  granted
             permission to appeal the First-tier Tribunal decision  in  all
             four appeals on 22nd May 2019. The appeals  thus  came  before
             me.

             ...

             Error of law

             7.   There are 3  appeals  before  me:  HU/07781/2015  (Kamala
             Kandel),  HU/07783/2015  (Bhojraj  Kandel)  and  HU/07780/2015
             (Kabita Kandel).

             8.   The grounds of appeal upon which permission to appeal has
             been granted are, in summary, as follows:

                  (i)  It is arguable that the  refusal  by  the  First-tier
                  Tribunal to grant an adjournment of the hearing to  permit
                  Kabita to give oral evidence was procedurally unfair;

                  (ii) It is arguable that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge
                  incorrectly equated Kabita and her  brother's  exceptional
                  educational qualifications and academic  talent  with  the
                  ability to overcome the practical, social,  financial  and
                  cultural challenges such that there would be no or no very
                  significant obstacles  to  their  reintegration  to  their
                  country of origin;

                  (iii)    It is  arguable  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge
                  failed to  undertake  a  'best  interests'  assessment  in
                  connection with Kabita compounded by  the  fact  that  the
                  First-tier Tribunal judge did not hear oral evidence  from
                  her;

                  (iv) It is arguable there were fundamental errors of  fact
                  by the First-tier  Tribunal  judge  who  referred  to  the
                  appellants as coming  from  Sri  Lanka  whereas  they  are
                  Nepalese; the incorrect understanding of their country  of
                  origin has, it is argued led to an incorrect assessment of
                  the obstacles they would face on return to Nepal.

             9.   Mr Chhotu  expanded  on  the  grounds  in  particular  by
             referring to the unfairness of the appeal  proceeding  without
             Kabita being given the opportunity to give oral  evidence.  It
             was unfair, he submitted, that she had been forced  to  choose
             between taking an A-level exam that day and attending to  give
             oral evidence in her appeal. It was offensive,  he  submitted,
             that her other family members should be presumed to be able to
             speak on her behalf and give the totality of the evidence that
             she would seek to give.

             10.  The references by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  to  Sri
             Lanka as oppose to Nepal confirmed,  he  submitted,  that  the
             judge had failed to give  anxious  scrutiny  to  the  evidence
             before him and the context in which those references  occurred
             illustrated that the judge had  considered   the  evidence  of
             reintegration  in  the  context  of  the  wrong  country  thus
             resulting in a flawed assessment.

             11.  Mr Melvin submitted that the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge
             had correctly refused to grant an adjournment. The  judge  had
             accepted the content of her witness statement and there was no
             indication what else she would have wanted to say that was not
             in the papers before him or not available from the evidence of
             her other family members. She had  arrived  in  the  UK  as  a
             dependent of her parents; they had no sustainable argument why
             they could not return to Nepal and it  followed,  despite  her
             exceptional educational  achievements  that  having  lived  in
             Nepal previously as a family, having lived  in  the  UK  as  a
             family, that all the appellants  would  and  could  return  to
             Nepal as a family. There were no insurmountable obstacles,  or
             obstacles, evident from the  evidence  before  the  First-tier
             Tribunal; if she wished to remain in the UK to study or  work,
             then it was open to her to make the relevant application.

             12.   Mr Melvin submitted that the reference by the  Judge  to
             Sri Lanka rather than Nepal was not material.  The  references
             to Sri Lanka were in only 4 paragraphs; it was plain when  the
             decision was read as a whole that the  judge  was  considering
             Nepal and the return of the family to  Nepal.  The  underlying
             issue was whether there were insurmountable obstacles  to  the
             family returning to Nepal; in these appeals  on  the  evidence
             before the First-tier Tribunal it could not be concluded  that
             such obstacles existed.

             Discussion

             13.  There is considerable force in  Mr  Melvin's  submissions
             that there was no indication what Kabita could or  would  have
             said if she had given oral evidence  and  thus  it  cannot  be
             concluded that the First-tier Tribunal judge was  procedurally
             unfair in refusing to grant  an  adjournment.  The  difficulty
             with that submission is that it is not for Kabita now, to  say
             what she would have said  then.  The  fact  is  that  she  was
             prevented from giving oral  evidence  in  her  appeal  despite
             having reasonably asked for an adjournment because she had  an
             A-level exam that day. I do not go so  far  as  Mr  Chhotu  is
             saying that it was oppressive and unfair  to  'force'  her  to
             choose. Nevertheless, the explanation provided why  she  could
             not attend the hearing was reasonable and at  the  very  least
             arrangements could have been made for her to give her evidence
             later that day or on another day separate from her parents and
             brother. That such an arrangement was not even considered, and
             a decision taken by the First-tier Tribunal judge  that  other
             family  members  could  speak  for  her  was  to  negate   the
             importance to her of her appeal.

             14.  Each of the family members has their own  appeal;  it  is
             not one appeal with the other family members dependant on  the
             outcome of that appeal. It is not inconceivable  that  one  or
             more may have been successful and others  unsuccessful,  given
             that  each  of  their  circumstances  are  different  in  some
             respects as well as similar in other respects. It  is  perhaps
             instructive that Kiran was in fact  successful  in  his  human
             rights claim because he was granted  leave  to  remain  for  a
             period of time. Given that Kabita was in the middle of her  A-
             levels such an outcome may have been the case for her as  well
             had an adjournment been granted.

             15.  I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal  judge  erred
             in law in refusing  to  grant  an  adjournment,  at  least  of
             Kabita's appeal hearing.

             16.  It seems that the appeals  were  presented  as  dependent
             upon each other, although whether this  would  have  been  the
             case if Kabita had given oral evidence is not  clear.  At  the
             time of the appeal Kabita was a minor. If her appeal had  been
             successful it is reasonable  to  conclude  that  her  parents,
             because of her age, would also have  been  successful.   I  am
             therefore  satisfied  that  the  refusal  by  the   First-tier
             Tribunal judge to grant an adjournment had, at  that  time,  a
             material adverse impact on the outcome of the appeals  of  her
             parents.

             17.  In so far as the references by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
             Judge  to  Sri  Lanka  are  concerned  I  do  not  accept  the
             submission of Mr Chhotu that they are material.  As  submitted
             by Mr Melvin, when the decision is read as a whole it is clear
             that the judge had Nepal in mind for  all  material  purposes.
             That the judge  failed  to  read  through  the  decision  once
             written is to be deprecated, but the conclusions  overall  are
             plainly reached in the context of Nepal.

             18.  In so far as it is submitted that  the  judge  failed  to
             have adequate regard to s55 and the best interest  of  Kabita,
             the judge considered s55 and reached  a  conclusion  that  was
             available to him on the evidence  that  was  before  him.  But
             because that evidence did not include  the  oral  evidence  of
             Kabita, the conclusion reached was legally flawed.

             19.  I set aside  the  decisions  reached  by  the  First-tier
             Tribunal in the  appeals  of  HU/07781/2015  (Kamala  Kandel),
             HU/07783/2015  (Bhojraj  Kandel)  and  HU/07780/2015   (Kabita
             Kandel). The decision of the First-tier Tribunal in the appeal
             HU/07773/2015 (Kiran Kandel) stands, the  appeal  having  been
             abandoned.

             Remaking the decision

             20.  Mr Chhotu submitted that if the decisions of  the  First-
             tier Tribunal are set aside, the appeals should be remitted to
             the First-tier Tribunal for hearing before a different  First-
             tier Tribunal judge. I decline  to  remit  to  the  First-tier
             Tribunal. The evidence of the parents and the brother  is  not
             contested and they each gave oral evidence before  the  First-
             tier Tribunal. The legal  error  has  arisen  because  of  the
             inability  of  the  daughter  to  give  oral   evidence.   The
             circumstances such as would lead to a remittal, as set out  in
             the practice direction, do not arise.




             Conclusions:

             The making of the decisions of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
             involve the making of an error on a point of law.

             I set aside the decisions in  the  appeals  of  HU/07781/2015,
             HU/07783/2015 and HU/07780/2015. ...

             ..."

      2. On 20th September 2019 I heard oral evidence from Kabita Kandel.  I
         had before me the documents that were relied upon before the First-
         tier  Tribunal  judge  and  I  heard  oral  submissions  from  both
         representatives.

         Uncontested and undisputed evidence

      3. Mrs Kandel entered the UK as a Tier 4 student on 4th February 2010.
         She has remained in the UK since that date with extended  leave  to
         remain until 2nd August  2015  and  thereafter  on  3C  leave.  Her
         husband, Mr Kandel, arrived in the UK  as  her  dependant  on  17th
         August 2010. He also remained in the  UK  with  extended  leave  to
         remain until 2nd August 2015 and  thereafter  on  3C  leave.  Their
         eldest child, Kiran  arrived  with  Kabita  on  8th  July  2011  as
         dependants of their mother; they also remained in the UK with leave
         to remain until 2nd August  2015.  On  8th  May  2019,  during  the
         currency of his 3C leave, Kiran was granted further leave to remain
         until 30th June 2019. He has  a  pending  application  for  further
         leave to remain and is currently on 3C leave. Kabita has, like  her
         parents, been on 3C leave since 2nd August 2015.

      4. The applications for further leave to remain in  the  UK  on  human
         rights grounds were made on 30th July 2015 on  Form  FLR(O).  Kiran
         completed his own separate application form; the  three  appellants
         completed a joint form. The covering letter was common to all  four
         applications. Written by Kiran, the letter refers, inter  alia,  to
         the following

             "... Kabita was only 12 when she arrived in the UK. She is now
             16 and spent the last 4 years and 1  month  in  the  UK  since
             arriving...

             ...

             Now through no fault of our own making we are now  facing  the
             prospect of having to leave the UK where  we  have  built  our
             lives as a family over the last few years ...As you  will  see
             from the supporting documents that we have submitted with  the
             application forms, we  have  worked  very  hard  to  establish
             ourselves with a family life in the UK for the last 4/5 years.

             ...

             [Kabita] has been educated in the UK and  has  just  completed
             her 'GCSE' examinations...Depending upon her results she would
             be able to attend  sixth  form  for  the  next  two  years  to
             progress her level of studies to attend  university  when  she
             becomes 18.

             ...

             To be able to fund ourselves in the  UK  my  father  sold  our
             house in Nepal for �9000. ...  this has helped  pay  for  mine
             and my sisters schooling and continued to help to pay  for  me
             [sic] mothers tuition fees and repeat visa applications.

             ...

             ...we are unable to go back to our native country as  we  have
             nowhere to live as  entire  villages  were  flattened  by  the
             earthquake [April 2015]. The basic essentials for life such as
             food, water, clothing, health care, education,  are  just  not
             available as all assistance has been  given  to  the  affected
             people inside the country at the time of the earthquake and is
             still ongoing to this current day.

             ...

             I  therefore  request  that  consideration  be  given  to  our
             situation that we are unable to go back to Nepal  as  we  have
             nowhere to live as we sold our original home in Nepal  and  it
             would be impossible to start over as a family in Nepal  taking
             into consideration the events of 25th April 2015."

      5. The social worker report, dated July 2015, submitted in support  of
         their application refers to both Kiran and  Kabita  openly  talking
         about not wanting to return to Nepal and that they feel settled and
         integrated into the British lifestyle.

      6. In her recent witness statement, Kabita states  that  she  was  not
         aware, until July 2015, that her stay in the UK  was  limited.  She
         states that she had always wanted to do chemical  engineering  (the
         social workers report says she wanted to be a  doctor  specialising
         in neurology).She  is  due  to  commence  the  third  year  of  her
         undergraduate degree at Queen  Mary  University  (a  Russell  group
         University) in chemical engineering in October 2019 and  has  exams
         in January and May 2020. She is expecting to do  well  having  done
         extremely well in her first and second years. She was  awarded  the
         Science and Engineering Excellence award of �5000 per year for each
         of her first two  years.  She  states  that  after  completing  her
         undergraduate degree, she has ambitions to undertake a Masters and/
         or PhD. She was not  asked,  and  did  not  say,  whether  she  had
         considered studying for those qualifications elsewhere than the UK.

      7. In her oral evidence, Kabita confirmed that she did not  intend  to
         settle permanently in the UK but  wanted  to  do  a  PhD  in  water
         purification; she wanted to help people in 3rd world countries. Her
         intentions were to complete her studies. In response to a  question
         about whether she had made  enquiries  about  taking  a  gap  year,
         returning to Nepal and then returning to  the  UK  with  a  student
         visa, she said she had  not  made  enquiries  but,  in  any  event,
         thought that a  gap  year  in  her  academic  discipline  would  be
         problematical because of the break in studying.

      8. Kabita is engaged to be married to  a  Nepalese  national  who  has
         indefinite leave to  remain  in  the  UK.  He  did  not  give  oral
         evidence: he was visiting his parents in  Nepal.  He  is  currently
         undertaking a fully funded PhD  at  Imperial  College,  London,  in
         fluid mechanics  in  aspects  of  aeronautical  engineering  having
         previously received a Masters  in  aeronautical  engineering.  They
         intend to marry next summer when she has graduated.

      9. Kiran was granted further leave to remain and at present is  on  3C
         leave.

     10. Mr and Mrs Kandel did not give oral evidence before me,  but  their
         previous evidence was not disputed.

         Submissions

     11. Mr Chhotu submitted that the  context  within  which  the  decision
         should be made for all appellants included that Kabita had  been  a
         minor throughout the application and decision making process  until
         the matter came before the Upper Tribunal; this impacted positively
         upon the weight to be given to her length of stay and that  account
         should be taken of the fact that had her application  been  granted
         (or her appeal allowed), as he submitted it should have been,  then
         she would not be in the same position today as she now is.  He  did
         not go so far, rightly so, as  to  assert  some  form  of  historic
         injustice or that I should reach my decision now on  the  basis  of
         the factual matrix as it was before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  but
         made strong submissions that greater weight should be  placed  upon
         those matters because she was a minor at  that  time.  He  drew  an
         analogy with the Windrush issue and the  voucher  system  for  East
         African Asians which, eventually, led to the righting of  a  wrong.
         There was, he submitted, no intention by the appellants  to  settle
         in the UK, the  intention  was  to  enable  the  family  to  remain
         together as a  dependent  family  unit  for  the  duration  of  the
         children's education. The proper procedure  is,  he  submitted  for
         Kabita's appeal to be considered first as a child and  then  as  an
         adult, then her parents including the effect on Kabita as  a  child
         and as an adult. He acknowledged that none of the  family  met  the
         Immigration   Rules   save   that   there   were,   he   submitted,
         insurmountable obstacles to their return to Nepal. Nevertheless, he
         submitted that in considering  s117B  Nationality  Immigration  and
         Asylum Act 2002  and  the  test  outlined  in  Razgar,  the  public
         interest in the refusal and subsequent removal  of  the  appellants
         both as a  family  and  as  individuals  was  outweighed  by  their
         cumulative circumstances; the decision to refuse  leave  to  remain
         was, he submitted, disproportionate.

     12. Mr Melvin did not dispute Kabita's evidence  save  as  referred  to
         herein. He submitted that  the  basis  of  the  current  claim  was
         founded upon continuing education which, as set out  in  Patel  and
         others [2013] UKSC 72, was not a sustainable basis for a successful
         human rights claim. The family have  been  pursuing  appeals  since
         2013 and it is this that has enabled Kabita  to  engage  in  higher
         level education. There was no evidence, he submitted,  that  Kabita
         could not take  a  gap  year  and  return  to  the  UK  with  entry
         clearance;  there  was  no  credible  evidence  of   insurmountable
         obstacles or of detrimental impact  should  the  family  return  to
         Nepal; there are no outstanding  medical  issues  and  no  credible
         evidence that the relationship between Kabita and  her  parents  is
         anything other than the usual level of  emotional  dependency  that
         exists between a daughter and her family,  albeit  it  is  a  close
         family. He submitted that they had never had leave to  enter  on  a
         route to settlement, the education being sought by Kabita  was  not
         for a short period  but for a lengthy period and her private  life,
         based as it was almost solely upon her  education  albeit  she  was
         engaged to  be  married  next  year  to  a  Nepalese  citizen  with
         indefinite leave to remain in the UK, was not such as could  render
         refusal of leave to remain disproportionate.

         Discussion

     13. I have placed no weight upon the social workers report. She has not
         stated how long she interviewed the family members for  or  whether
         she interviewed them as a group or individually. She expressed  her
         conclusions in terms of the availability  of  educational,  housing
         and health facilities in Nepal but makes no reference  to  how  she
         has reached her  conclusion  as  to  the  claimed  difficulties  in
         reintegration. There is no indication in the report  that  she  has
         any expertise with regard to country  conditions  in  Nepal  either
         with regard to the area this family comes from or Nepal  generally.
         There are family members in Nepal, and she makes  no  reference  to
         the possibility  of  support  from  those  family  members  or  why
         adequate education could not be available. At best the  only  thing
         to be taken from this report is that  the  family  feel  they  have
         integrated into Britain, do not wish to leave, Kiran and Kabita are
         doing well academically and that they fear the disruption to  their
         education if they were to leave. None of these  conclusions  is  in
         any way surprising or out of the ordinary where secondary education
         has been pursued in the UK by academically bright youngsters. I  am
         unable to draw from her report a conclusion  that  each  and  every
         member of the family expressed a desire to  remain  permanently  in
         the UK.

     14. The country information available, relied upon  by  the  respondent
         and not subject to challenge by the  appellants  save  through  the
         expression of opinion and the social worker report, is  that  there
         is a functioning education system in Nepal. I was not provided with
         evidence to  the  contrary  and  Mr  Chhotu  did  not  submit  that
         education facilities  would  not  be  available,  merely  that  the
         standard and quality of education available would  not  be  at  the
         level currently being experienced by Kabita.

     15. The family members remaining in Nepal  have  relocated.  Mr  Kandel
         visited his family in 2013  and  remained  there  for  about  three
         months. Although evidence was led that various family members  live
         in a rural area with limited links to cities or towns where Mr  and
         Mrs Kandel would be able to and could expect to find employment, no
         evidence was given why initial short term assistance could  not  be
         provided or why the financial assistance currently being provide by
         family members in the UK could not continue whilst the  family  re-
         established themselves.

     16. The family entered the UK as students/student dependants.  This  is
         not a route to settlement and although  I  accept  that  Kiran  and
         Kabita were personally unaware of the limited  leave  granted,  the
         fact remains that the family house was sold by the parents  in  the
         full knowledge that they could not expect to remain permanently  in
         the UK and that they would have  to  make  arrangements  for  self-
         financing their return on conclusion of the  leave  that  they  had
         been granted. I accept and acknowledge the devastation undergone in
         Nepal because of the earthquakes in 2015 together with the  ongoing
         significant problems with the  infra-structure  in  Nepal  but  the
         family have relatives in Nepal; they have  financial  support  from
         family members in the  UK;  the  parents  have  qualifications  and
         expertise obtained in the UK and there is scant evidence they would
         not be able to find employment - particularly given that Mrs Kandel
         is a qualified teacher. I accept that  return  would  be  difficult
         given  the  length  of  time  away  from  Nepal,  but   it   cannot
         realistically be submitted that these  difficulties  come  anywhere
         close to amounting to insurmountable obstacles.

     17. The two children are now adults. They live  together  as  a  family
         unit but there  was  no  significant  evidence  that  there  was  a
         dependency in physical or emotional terms other than that they were
         a close-knit family and, if separated,  would  be  upset  and  such
         separation would take time to adjust. I acknowledge and accept  the
         evidence from Kabita that when she and her brother  were  in  Nepal
         and separated from their parents, they found it difficult and  that
         Kabita was bullied. But they were  young  then,  facing  separation
         from their parents possibly for the first time  and  such  distress
         would have been inevitable.

     18.  I  note  Mr  Chhotu's  submissions   regarding   the   change   in
         circumstances with Kabita reaching adulthood  over  the  period  of
         time that the appeal process has taken place. Conversely,  had  the
         family left the UK when they were  refused  further  leave,  Kabita
         would not have continued her education in  the  form  she  has.  It
         cannot be concluded with  any  certainty  that  Kabita  would  have
         succeeded in her appeal and, even if  she  had,  that  her  parents
         would have succeeded in theirs. It is not a question of 'righting a
         wrong'. The appeals have to be  determined  on  the  basis  of  the
         evidence as it was before me on the date of the hearing before  me,
         which includes her current personal circumstances.

     19. Kabita is now an adult. Her brother has an application  pending  at
         the Home Office. There is no evidence before me  such  that  I  can
         conclude that it would  be  disproportionate  for  her  parents  to
         return to Nepal - that they sold their assets to fund Mrs  Kandel's
         education was a matter for them and would have been  taken  in  the
         full knowledge that they could not expect to remain permanently  in
         the UK - or indeed  for  an  extended  period  of  time  after  her
         education  had  concluded.  Whilst  the   earthquake   has   caused
         devastation in Nepal there was a lack of evidence that it  impacted
         or will impact upon them such as to  amount  to  an  insurmountable
         obstacle for her  and  her  husband's  return  to  Nepal.  This  is
         particularly so given they both have qualifications which  will  be
         of use to them and there are relatives who can assist at  least  in
         the short term. I accept they will have short term difficulties.  I
         also accept that they speak English, would  be  unlikely  to  be  a
         burden to the UK State, that they have  developed  friendships  and
         ties to others in the UK and that  although  some  limited  medical
         treatment  may  be  required,  treatment  is  available  in  Nepal.
         Nevertheless there are no significant or  insurmountable  obstacles
         to their return to Nepal. There is nothing out of the  ordinary  in
         their case. The decision to refuse their Article  8  claim  is  not
         disproportionate.

     20. It follows that  I  dismiss  the  appeals  of  Mr  and  Mrs  Kandel
         (HU/07781/2015, HU/07783/2015).

     21. Kabita's position is different from that of  her  parents  and  her
         brother. She has just started her  third  and  final  year  of  her
         degree at Queen Mary University. She has been awarded large sums of
         money for excellence and there is no doubt but  that  he  fees  and
         living costs are being met. Her evidence, which I accept, was  that
         it was not her intention to settle in the UK. She wants to complete
         her education. She has yet to finish her undergraduate  degree  and
         although she aspires to undertake a Masters and/or a  PhD,  I  have
         disregarded this as being relevant. It  is  speculative  to  assume
         that she would be offered a place/funding or  that  such  education
         would take place in the UK.

     22. Completion of her undergraduate  degree  is  not  speculative.  Her
         academic ability is not in doubt; she has less than a calendar year
         of her course left.

     23. Mr Melvin relied upon [57] of Patel which reads as follows:

             "57. It is important to remember  that  article  8  is  not  a
             general dispensing power. It is to be distinguished  from  the
             Secretary of State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
             outside the rules, which may be  unrelated  to  any  protected
             human right. The merits of a decision not to depart  from  the
             rules are not reviewable on appeal:  section  86(6).  One  may
             sympathise with Sedley LJ's call in Pankina for "common sense"
             in the application of the rules to  graduates  who  have  been
             studying in the  UK  for  some  years  (see  para  47  above).
             However, such considerations  do  not  by  themselves  provide
             grounds of appeal under article 8,  which  is  concerned  with
             private or family life, not education as such. The opportunity
             for a  promising  student  to  complete  his  course  in  this
             country, however desirable in general terms, is not in  itself
             a right protected under article 8."

     24. Mr Chhotu submitted that there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to
         Kabita returning to Nepal. This cannot be the case,  not  only  for
         the reasons I have set out above in relation to  her  parents,  but
         also she would be returning home with her parents and would be able
         to obtain employment with qualifications she has obtained  so  far.
         The fact that the courses she wishes to pursue are not available in
         Nepal does not amount to an obstacle to her return. There  may  not
         be the equivalent university education in Nepal; but that does  not
         render her return to Nepal insurmountable.

     25. Kabita cannot meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules and it
         follows that consideration of her appeal has to be in broad Article
         8 terms, taking full account of and placing weight  upon  the  fact
         that she does not meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.
         That she speaks English, is financially able  to  support  herself,
         would not have family ties here in the UK (her parents having  lost
         their appeal  and  therefore  returning  to  Nepal)  and  that  her
         immigration status is precarious is self-evident. It  can  be  said
         that this appeal falls  fully  and  squarely  within  the  question
         whether it would be disproportionate for her to return to Nepal  in
         the final year of her undergraduate degree with the possibility  of
         her returning to complete the final year, a year later. In a  sense
         one only has to pose the question to reach the answer that  in  the
         particular  circumstances  of  this  appellant  it  would  not   be
         proportionate. She is an excellent  student  whose  excellence  has
         been recognised and financially rewarded by the University  she  is
         attending. Until very recently she was a minor  whose  presence  in
         the UK has been dictated to by her  parents.  It  would  have  been
         unreasonable for her to fail or refuse to attend university  during
         that period of time, given not only her academic ability  but  also
         that there was no legal restriction on her  doing  so.  Of  course,
         article 8 is not a general  dispensing  power;  nor  is  article  8
         concerned with education as such. Nor is the desire  of  Kabita  to
         complete her course in the UK a right protected  under  Article  8.
         But in her case, it is  not  that  straightforward.  She  undertook
         education as a dependant of her mother whilst she was a minor.  She
         started her university course as a minor. Whilst there  can  be  no
         expectation now on her part that she would be able  to  commence  a
         Masters course or PhD, it is reasonable  for  her  to  be  able  to
         complete her current undergraduate degree -  a  matter  of  some  8
         months. The investment by the University as well  as  her  personal
         investment and circumstances are  matters  that  do  weigh  in  the
         assessment of the proportionality of the decision to  refuse  leave
         to remain to complete her current  undergraduate  course;  a  young
         person who has been in the UK since the  age  of  12  and  who  has
         culturally and socially integrated into the UK. That she is engaged
         to be married is of no relevance  to  the  proportionality  of  the
         decision. Nor is the fact that she would be in the UK  without  her
         parents - she is now an adult.

     26. In these circumstances I allow her appeal (HU/07780/2015).

     27. In allowing the appeal I make clear that this is not on  the  basis
         that I take the view that it would be  disproportionate  to  enable
         her to continue her education after completion of her undergraduate
         degree -  any  such  further  leave  would  be  a  matter  for  the
         respondent at that time. It is not  inconceivable  that  she  would
         seek to continue her studies elsewhere than the UK.




    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law in all three appeals.

    I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

    I re-make the decision in the appeal by:

         Dismissing the appeal in HU/07781/2015 - Kamala Gautam Kandel

         Dismissing the appeal in HU/07783/2015 - Bhojraj Kandel

         Allowing the appeal in HU/07780/2015 - Kabita Kandel
