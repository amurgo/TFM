Representation:
For the Appellant:     M-R Solicitors, South Woodford
For the Respondent:    Ms Fujiwala, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants, who are a family of three and are citizens of Pakistan,
    appealed against a decision of the Respondent, made on 2nd August  2016
    refusing their applications for  residence  cards  as  extended  family
    members of an EEA national  exercising  treaty  rights  in  the  United
    Kingdom.   Their appeals were dismissed  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    This was on the basis that it had  been  established  by  the  reported
    decision in Sala (EFMs: right of appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411  (IAC)  that
    the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeals.

 2. It has now been held that Sala was wrongly decided.  There is indeed  a
    right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal against decisions  taken  by
    the Respondent refusing applications pursuant to the Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006, as decided by the Court of  Appeal  in  Khan  v  SSHD
    [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.

 3. The decision under challenge  in  the  present  proceedings  was  taken
    pursuant to the 2006 Regulations. Therefore it follows that it  was  an
    error of law for the First-tier Tribunal to  dismiss  the  appeals  for
    want of jurisdiction.

 4. This means that these  appeals  have  not  yet  started  their  process
    through the First-tier Tribunal and therefore there remain  outstanding
    triable issues which need to be resolved.  The Appellants'  appeals  to
    the Upper Tribunal are therefore allowed to the extent that the appeals
    are remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be determined fully on their
    merits.  Both representatives who appeared before me were in  agreement
    that this is the proper course.

Decision

In dismissing the appeals for want of jurisdiction the  First-tier  Tribunal
materially erred in law.

The appeals to the Upper Tribunal are therefore allowed to the  extent  that
these appeals are remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (not  Judge  S  J
Clarke) to be determined on their merits.

No anonymity direction is made.
