Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order.  Unless the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  original
Appellant. This direction applies to,  amongst  others,  all  parties.   Any
failure to comply with this direction could give rise to contempt  of  court
proceedings.

Representation

For the Appellants:    Ms K Cronin and Ms A Smith,  of  counsel,  instructed
                  by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants

For the Respondent:    Mr T Poole, of counsel, instructed by the Government
                  Legal Department


While the Immigration Rules make no provision for  family  reunification  in
the United Kingdom in the case of a child who has  been  granted  asylum,  a
refusal to permit the family members of such child to enter  and  remain  in
the United Kingdom may constitute a disproportionate breach of the right  to
respect for family life enjoyed by all family members under Article 8  ECHR.



                                  DECISION

Introduction

 1. In this appeal, the  Appellants  are  two  of  the  three  protagonists
    concerned. All three are members of the same family unit  and  all  are
    nationals of Eritrea.  They consist of a mother and her two  sons.  The
    two Appellants currently reside in Sudan.  The first Appellant  is  the
    mother, now aged 34 years.  The second Appellant is  her  younger  son,
    now aged fifteen years. The third family member, M, is aged  19  years.
    He is described in many parts of the evidence as the "sponsor".

 2. One stand out feature of M's circumstances is that, having  arrived  in
    the United Kingdom as an unaccompanied minor in 2012, then aged 16,  he
    succeeded in his appeal against a refusal of asylum,  with  the  result
    that the Secretary of State for the Home Department (the "Secretary  of
    State") granted him five years limited leave to remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom, as a refugee, a period which will expire on 07 April 2018.   M
    aspires to achieve family reunification with his  mother  and  brother,
    the two Appellants, in  the  United  Kingdom.   He  does  so  primarily
    through the vehicle of Article 8 ECHR.

The Impugned Decisions

 3. The decisions underlying these proceedings and to which the origins  of
    these combined appeals can be traced were made by the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer of Abu Dhabi (the "ECO"), the alter-ego  of  the  Secretary  of
    State, in December 2013.  By his decisions the ECO refused to grant the
    Appellants entry clearance to join the sponsor in the  United  Kingdom.
    In refusing the mother's application, the ECO stated:

         "I have considered your application  under  paragraph  352  of  the
         ...... Immigration Rules .....


         I have used all the information provided by you to determine if the
         Immigration Rules have been met .....


         Immigration Rules  for  family  reunion  only  apply  to  dependent
         partners and children  of  sponsors,  not  for  [sic]  parents  and
         siblings.  As such you have applied  in  a  category  that  is  not
         covered by Rules [sic] and your application falls for refusal under
         paragraph 320(1)."

    The refusal decision as regards the  second  Appellant  was  framed  in
    precisely the same terms, albeit he was described  erroneously  as  the
    sponsor's "son".





Factual Framework

 4. The factual matrix is a mixture of certain uncontentious facts  and  my
    further findings, infra.

 5. When they lived in Eritrea the  family  unit  consisted  of  the  three
    protagonists and the first  Appellant's  husband.   He  was  imprisoned
    there for political reasons and, fearing persecution by the  Government
    she and her two sons fled Eritrea. This occurred in two stages.  First,
    in April 2012, M left Eritrea, accompanied by  his  uncle.   Later,  in
    January 2013, the two Appellants fled, travelling  on  foot  to  Sudan.
    There they were accommodated in the UNHCR  refugee  camp  in  Shagarab.
    They were given UNHCR identity cards.  The first  Appellant  considered
    this an unsafe place on account of the phenomena of kidnapping refugees
    and human trafficking.

 6. In May 2013 the first Appellant succeeded in contacting M by telephone,
    from the camp, assisted by a UNHCR aide.  The same person assisted  the
    two Appellants in travelling to Khartoum, some 650 kilometres away, for
    the purpose of making their entry clearance applications to the  United
    Kingdom.  The first Appellant decided that it would be safe  to  remain
    in Khartoum and, further, preferred to be close to  the  Embassy.   She
    borrowed money to pay the visa fees.  Thereafter,  the  two  Appellants
    lived on the streets of the city, occasionally  managing  to  sleep  in
    shelters or on church floors.  She succeeded in getting  some  limited,
    illegal work.  Both remained in Khartoum at the time of the  First-tier
    Tribunal ("FtT") hearing giving rise to this appeal.

 7. Pausing at this juncture, I acknowledge that the  FtT  did  not  accept
    certain aspects of the factual  case  put  forward  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellants.  The basis upon and terms in which some of their assertions
    were rejected formed one of the grounds upon which the decision of  the
    FtT was subsequently set aside  by  this  Tribunal.   In  remaking  the
    decision, I have considered the same evidence as that available to  the
    FtT. Having done so, I am satisfied to the requisite  standard  of  the
    truth and accuracy of the Appellants' account.

 8. I have considered in particular the  evidence  bearing  on  the  family
    bonds and the inter-dependency of its members.  From this it  is  clear
    to me that this is a close, loving and mutually supportive family  unit
    all of whose members would  be  overjoyed  if  reunification  could  be
    achieved.  There is clearly discernible interdependence.  The  enormous
    efforts to which the first Appellant went, the hardships which she  has
    borne and the sacrifices which she has made, all in pursuit  of  family
    reunification, bear eloquent testimony to the virtues and character  of
    the mother and the strength and stability of the family unit.   Notably
    the ECO did not suggest that the Appellants are economic migrants and I
    am satisfied that there  is  no  evidence  from  which  this  could  be
    inferred in any event. In this context it is appropriate to highlight a
    passage in the statement of a teacher who has formed part of  M's  life
    during almost two years:

         "He was devastated when he  received  the  news  that  the  initial
         application had been rejected and actually had  to  take  time  off
         school to pull himself  together.   His  foster  parents  are  very
         caring, but I know that his real mother has a special place in  his
         heart and he does not feel the  same  sense  of  belonging  to  his
         foster parents."

    This evidence has the supreme virtues that it is manifestly  objective,
    independent and measured.  In passing, the teacher  concerned  deserves
    commendation for  taking  the  trouble  to  provide  her  detailed  and
    balanced witness statement.

 9. The mother and younger son  plainly  live  in  deprived  and  dangerous
    circumstances. They are  destitute.   The  second  Appellant  has  been
    unwell for a long time.  This is a fractured family.  Neither  son  has
    had the benefit of a father, or father figure, for several years.   The
    mother struggles on, battling against the odds, deprived of the immense
    assistance and support which the sponsor would be capable of providing.
    Meanwhile, M has  become  increasingly  stressed  and  preoccupied.  He
    appears to be under-achieving academically and  his  social  activities
    have become limited. Having reached his 18th birthday, the  sponsor  is
    no longer in foster care. Some three years have elapsed since  he  last
    saw his mother and younger brother.  His status is  that  of  a  former
    looked after child. He cuts  an  isolated  and  unsupported  figure,  a
    teenager living in an unfamiliar foreign  country  without  any  family
    support whatsoever. I am satisfied that his need for reunification with
    his mother and younger brother has not diminished since his advent  and
    is, if anything, greater than ever.

Family Reunification: the Secretary of State's Policy

10. The Secretary of State's policy in the realm of  family  reunification,
    as expressed in the Immigration Rules, dates from the  year  2000.  Its
    most important feature, for the purposes of these appeals, is  that  no
    provision has ever been made for family reunification in the case of  a
    child who has  gained  refugee  status  in  the  United  Kingdom.  This
    discrete regime is currently contained in Part 8 of Appendix FM to  the
    Rules, at paragraphs 352A - 352G and 819L - 819U.   In  short,  spouses
    and minor children of  a  "sponsor"  can,  subject  to  satisfying  the
    governing conditions, secure family reunification in the United Kingdom
    by the grant of leave to enter.  However,  this  possibility  does  not
    exist where the sponsor is a child.

11. Thus a blanket prohibition is in operation.  Historically, there was  a
    short lived exception to this prohibition relating to  the  parents  of
    unaccompanied children who had fled Kosovo and secured  asylum  in  the
    United Kingdom.  This concession was confined to the short  time  frame
    of July to September 1999.  With  effect  from  02  October  2000,  the
    family  reunification  regime  enshrined  in  the   Immigration   Rules
    contained the aforementioned blanket prohibition.  From  then  to  2006
    the Secretary of State operated a policy of permitting the  parents  or
    siblings of unaccompanied minor refugees to enter  the  United  Kingdom
    for  the  purpose  of   reunification   only   where   compelling   and
    compassionate circumstances were demonstrated. Since 2006 the Secretary
    of State's policy  has  extinguished  this  possibility.   While  these
    appeals have generated much documentary  evidence  pertaining  to  this
    discrete issue, it is  striking  that  there  is  no  evidence  bearing
    directly  on  the  policy  aims  and  justification  underpinning  this
    exclusion. I shall revisit this discrete issue infra.

Legal Framework

12. As appears from the above, the refusal decisions of the ECO  were  made
    solely by reference to the Immigration Rules.  The appeal  to  the  FtT
    was based on Article 8 ECHR.  One of the salient features of the  legal
    framework is that the Immigration Rules contain no provision for family
    reunification in the case of a child refugee.  Nor does  the  Secretary
    of State operate any policy to this effect.  There is  (very  properly)
    no dispute about the existence of family life and the interference with
    Article 8(1) wrought by the decisions of the ECO. Thus the  fundamental
    question for this Tribunal is whether such interference is necessary in
    a democratic society viz is  a  proportionate  means  of  securing  the
    legitimate aim in play, namely immigration control.   The statement  of
    Lord Bingham of Cornhill in Huang v SSHD [2007]  2  AC  167,  at  [18],
    applies fully to these appeals:

         "The Strasbourg Court has repeatedly recognised the  general  right
         of States to control the entry and residence of  non-nationals  and
         repeatedly acknowledged that the Convention  confers  no  right  on
         individuals or families to choose where they  prefer  to  live.  In
         most cases where the applicants complain of a  violation  of  their
         Article 8  rights,  in  a  case  where  the  impugned  decision  is
         authorised by law for a legitimate object and the interference  (or
         lack of  respect)  is  of  sufficient  seriousness  to  engage  the
         operation of Article 8,  the  crucial  question  is  likely  to  be
         whether the interference (or lack  of  respect)  complained  of  is
         proportionate to the legitimate aim sought to be achieved."

    The balance to be struck involves an exercise of weighing the rights of
    the  individual  and  the  interests  of  the  community:   see   [19].
    Furthermore, this Tribunal is the arbiter of proportionality, which  is
    to be judged objectively: R (SB) v Governors  of  Denbigh  High  School
    [2007] 1 AC 100, per Lord Bingham at [30].

13. Article 8 ECHR is in the following terms:


        "1. Everyone has the right to respect for his  private  and  family
        life, his home and his correspondence.
        2. There shall be no interference by a public  authority  with  the
        exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law
        and is necessary in  a  democratic  society  in  the  interests  of
        national security, public safety or the economic well-being of  the
        country,  for  the  prevention  of  disorder  or  crime,  for   the
        protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights
        and freedoms of others."

     By section 3 of the Immigration Act 1971 it  is  provided  (insofar  as
material):

        "(1) Except as otherwise provided by or under  this  Act,  where  a
        person is not a British citizen
           (a) he shall not enter the United Kingdom unless given leave  to
           do so in accordance with the provisions of, or made under,  this
           Act;
           (b) he may be given leave to enter the United Kingdom (or,  when
           already there, leave to remain in the United Kingdom) either for
           a limited or for an indefinite period;
           (c) if he is given limited leave  to  enter  or  remain  in  the
           United Kingdom, it may be given subject to all  or  any  of  the
           following conditions, namely-
              (i) a condition restricting his employment or  occupation  in
              the United Kingdom;
              (ia) a  condition  restricting  his  studies  in  the  United
              Kingdom;
              (ii) a condition requiring him to  maintain  and  accommodate
              himself, and any  dependants  of  his,  without  recourse  to
              public funds;
              (iii) a condition requiring him to register with the police;
              (iv) a condition requiring him to report  to  an  immigration
              officer or the Secretary of State; and
              (v) a condition about residence.


        (2) The Secretary of State shall from time to time (and as soon  as
        may be) lay before Parliament statements of the rules,  or  of  any
        changes in the rules, laid down by him as to  the  practice  to  be
        followed in the administration of this Act for regulating the entry
        into and stay in the United Kingdom of persons required by this Act
        to have leave to enter, including any rules as to  the  period  for
        which leave is to be given and the conditions  to  be  attached  in
        different circumstances ..."

    Section 117A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  (the
    "2002 Act") provides:


         "(1)  This Part applies where a court or tribunal is  required  to
           determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-
           (a) breaches a person's right to respect for private and  family
              life under Article 8, and
           (b) as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of  the  Human
              Rights Act 1998.
        (2) In considering the  public  interest  question,  the  court  or
           tribunal must (in particular) have regard-
           (a) in all cases, to the considerations listed in section  117B,
              and
           (b) in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals, to
              the considerations listed in section 117C.
        (3) In subsection (2), "the public  interest  question"  means  the
           question of whether an interference with  a  person's  right  to
           respect for private and family life is justified  under  Article
           8(2)."

    By section 117B:

         "(1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is  in  the
    public interest.

          (2) It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
          interests of the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,  that
          persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able
          to speak English, because persons who can speak English-
             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

          (3) It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
          interests of the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,  that
          persons who seek to enter or remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
          financially independent, because such persons-
             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

          (4) Little weight should be given to-
             (a) a private life, or
             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
          that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is  in
          the United Kingdom unlawfully.

          (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by
          a person at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
          precarious.

          (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
          public interest does not require the person's removal where-
             (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine   and   subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and
             (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
             United Kingdom. "

14. M was a child,  present  in  the  United  Kingdom,  when  the  impugned
    decisions of the  ECO  were  made.   Accordingly,  section  55  of  the
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2009  (the  "2009  Act")  is
    engaged.  This provides in material part:

        "(1) The Secretary of State must  make  arrangements  for  ensuring
        that-
           (a) the functions mentioned in  subsection  (2)  are  discharged
           having regard to the need to safeguard and promote  the  welfare
           of children who are in the United Kingdom, and
           (b)  any  services  provided  by  another  person  pursuant   to
           arrangements which are made by the Secretary of State and relate
           to the discharge of a function mentioned in subsection  (2)  are
           provided having regard to that need.


        (2) The functions referred to in subsection (1) are-
           (a) any function of  the  Secretary  of  State  in  relation  to
           immigration, asylum or nationality;
           (b) any function conferred by or by virtue  of  the  Immigration
           Acts on an immigration officer;
           (c) any general customs function of the Secretary of State;
           (d) any customs  function  conferred  on  a  designated  customs
           official.


        (3) A person exercising any of those functions must, in  exercising
        the function, have regard to any guidance given to  the  person  by
        the Secretary of State for the purpose of subsection (1)...


        (6) In this section-
        "children" means persons who are under the age of 18;
        "customs function",  "designated  customs  official"  and  "general
        customs function" have the meanings given by Part 1".


    The  statutory  guidance  made  pursuant  to  section  55(2)  is,   for
    convenience, reproduced in the Appendix to this  judgment.   This  will
    hopefully  serve  to  give  this  measure  the  substantially   greater
    prominence which, given my experience  in  children's  immigration  and
    asylum cases, it merits.


15. The United Nations Convention on the Rights  of  the  Child  ("UNCRC"),
    which has been ratified by the United  Kingdom,  contains,  in  Article
    3(1) the provision wherein the genesis of section 55 reposes.   Article
    3(1) provides:


        "Article 3
        1. In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public
        or  private   social   welfare   institutions,   courts   of   law,
        administrative  authorities  or  legislative   bodies,   the   best
        interests of the child shall be a primary consideration."

         The argument developed on behalf of the  Appellants  also  pray  in
    aid certain other provisions of UNCRC.

         Article 6(2)

        "States Parties shall ensure to the  maximum  extent  possible  the
        survival and development of the child."





         Article 9

        "1. States Parties shall ensure that a child shall not be separated
        from his or her parents against their will, except  when  competent
        authorities subject to judicial  review  determine,  in  accordance
        with  applicable  law  and  procedures,  that  such  separation  is
        necessary for the best interests of the child.  Such  determination
        may be necessary in a particular case such as one  involving  abuse
        or neglect of the child by the parents, or one  where  the  parents
        are living separately and a decision must be made as to the child's
        place of residence.
        2. In any proceedings  pursuant  to  paragraph  1  of  the  present
        article, all interested parties shall be given  an  opportunity  to
        participate in the proceedings and make their views known.
        3. States Parties shall respect the  right  of  the  child  who  is
        separated from one or both parents to maintain  personal  relations
        and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, except  if
        it is contrary to the child's best interests.
        4. Where such separation results from any  action  initiated  by  a
        State  Party,  such  as   the   detention,   imprisonment,   exile,
        deportation or death (including death arising from any cause  while
        the person is in the custody of the State) of one or  both  parents
        or of the child, that State Party shall, upon request, provide  the
        parents, the child or, if appropriate, another member of the family
        with the essential information concerning the  whereabouts  of  the
        absent  member(s)  of  the  family  unless  the  provision  of  the
        information would be detrimental to the well-being  of  the  child.
        States Parties shall further ensure that the submission of  such  a
        request shall of itself entail  no  adverse  consequences  for  the
        person(s) concerned."

         Article 22

        "1. States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure that a
        child who is seeking refugee status or who is considered a  refugee
        in accordance with applicable international  or  domestic  law  and
        procedures shall, whether unaccompanied or accompanied  by  his  or
        her parents or by any other person, receive appropriate  protection
        and humanitarian assistance in the enjoyment of  applicable  rights
        set forth in the present  Convention  and  in  other  international
        human rights or humanitarian instruments to which the  said  States
        are Parties.
        2. For this purpose, States Parties shall provide, as they consider
        appropriate, co-operation in any efforts by the United Nations  and
        other competent intergovernmental organizations or non-governmental
        organizations co-operating with the United Nations to  protect  and
        assist such a child and to trace the parents or  other  members  of
        the family of any refugee child  in  order  to  obtain  information
        necessary for reunification with his or her family. In cases  where
        no parents or other members of the family can be found,  the  child
        shall  be  accorded  the  same  protection  as  any   other   child
        permanently  or  temporarily  deprived  of  his   or   her   family
        environment  for  any  reason  ,  as  set  forth  in  the   present
        Convention."

16. In this context the Appellants also draw on the United Nations  General
    Comment  Number  6/2005,  "Treatment  of  Unaccompanied  and  Separated
    Children outside their Country  of  Origin"  and,  in  particular,  the
    following passages:


        Paragraph 79


        "The ultimate aim  in  addressing  the  fate  of  unaccompanied  or
        separated children is to identify a durable solution that addresses
        all their protection needs, takes into  account  the  child's  view
        and, wherever possible, leads to  overcoming  the  situation  of  a
        child being unaccompanied or separated.  Efforts  to  find  durable
        solutions  for  unaccompanied  or  separated  children  should   be
        initiated  and  implemented  without  undue  delay  and,   wherever
        possible,  immediately  upon  the  assessment  of  a  child   being
        unaccompanied or separated. Following a rights-based approach,  the
        search  for  a  durable  solution  commences  with  analysing   the
        possibility of family reunification."

        Paragraph 82


        "Family reunification in the country of origin is not in  the  best
        interests of the child and
        should therefore not be pursued where there is a "reasonable  risk"
        that such a return would lead to the violation of fundamental human
        rights of the child. Such risk is indisputably  documented  in  the
        granting of refugee status  or  in  a  decision  of  the  competent
        authorities on the  applicability  of  non-refoulement  obligations
        (including those deriving from article 3 of the Convention  against
        Torture  and  Other  Cruel,  Inhuman  or  Degrading  Treatment   or
        Punishment and articles 6 and 7 of the  International  Covenant  on
        Civil and Political Rights). Accordingly, the granting  of  refugee
        status constitutes a legally binding  obstacle  to  return  to  the
        country  of  origin  and,  consequently,  to  family  reunification
        therein. Where the circumstances in the country of  origin  contain
        lower level risks and there is concern, for example, of  the  child
        being  affected  by  the  indiscriminate  effects  of   generalized
        violence, such risks must be  given  full  attention  and  balanced
        against   other   rights-based   considerations,   including    the
        consequences of further separation. In this  context,  it  must  be
        recalled that the survival of the child is of paramount  importance
        and a precondition for the enjoyment of any other rights."

        Paragraph 83


        "Whenever family reunification in the  country  of  origin  is  not
        possible, irrespective of whether this is due to legal obstacles to
        return or  whether  the  best-interests-based  balancing  test  has
        decided against return, the obligations under article 9 and  10  of
        the  Convention  come  into  effect  and  should  govern  the  host
        country's  decisions  on  family  reunification  therein.  In  this
        context,   States   parties   are   particularly   reminded    that
        "applications by a child or his or her parents to enter or leave  a
        State party for the purpose of family reunification shall be  dealt
        with by States  parties  in  a  positive,  humane  and  expeditious
        manner"  and  "shall  entail  no  adverse  consequences   for   the
        applicants and for the members of  their  family"  (art.  10  (1)).
        Countries of origin must respect "the right of the child and his or
        her parents to leave any country, including their own, and to enter
        their own country" (art. 10 (2))."

17. I record at this juncture that, invoking the well known "opt  out"  TEU
    mechanism, the United Kingdom (in common with Ireland and Denmark) does
    not subscribe to the  soi-disant  family  reunification  directive  viz
    Council Directive 2003/86/EC of 22 September 2003.   As a  result,  the
    Appellants are unable to invoke directly the  benefits  of  Article  3,
    which provides:


        1. This Directive shall  apply  where  the  sponsor  is  holding  a
        residence permit issued by a Member State for a period of  validity
        of one year or more who has reasonable prospects of  obtaining  the
        right of permanent residence, if the members of his or  her  family
        are third country nationals of whatever status.


        2. This Directive shall not apply where the sponsor is:
             (a)  applying  for  recognition   of   refugee   status   whose
             application has not yet given rise to a final decision;
             (b) authorised to reside in a Member  State  on  the  basis  of
             temporary protection or applying for authorisation to reside on
             that basis and awaiting a decision on his status;
             (c) authorised to reside in a Member State on the  basis  of  a
             subsidiary form of protection in accordance with  international
             obligations, national legislation or the practice of the Member
             States or applying for authorisation to reside  on  that  basis
             and awaiting a decision on his status.


        3. This Directive shall not apply to members of  the  family  of  a
        Union citizen.


        4.  This  Directive  is  without  prejudice  to   more   favourable
        provisions of:
             (a) bilateral and multilateral agreements between the Community
             or the Community and its Member States, on the  one  hand,  and
             third countries, on the other;
             (b) the European Social Charter of 18 October 1961, the amended
             European  Social  Charter  of  3  May  1987  and  the  European
             Convention on the legal status of migrant
             workers of 24 November 1977.


        5. This Directive shall not affect the possibility for  the  Member
        States to adopt or maintain more favourable provisions."

     However, I consider that indirect reliance on aspects of  this  measure
    may be possible via the guidance published by the  Secretary  of  State
    under section 55(2) of the 2009 Act: see [31] infra.

18.  In contrast, Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April  2004,  the  co-
    called "Qualification Directive" does  apply  in  the  United  Kingdom,
    having  been  transposed  by  the  Refugee  or  Person   in   need   of
    International  Protection  (Qualification)   Regulations   2006.   This
    prescribes "minimum standards for the qualification and status of third
    country nationals or stateless persons as persons  who  otherwise  need
    international protection and the content of  the  protection  granted."
    Article 23 provides:


        "Maintaining family unity
        1. Member States shall ensure that family unity can be maintained.


        2.  Member  States  shall  ensure  that  family  members   of   the
        beneficiary of refugee or subsidiary protection status, who do  not
        individually qualify for such status, are  entitled  to  claim  the
        benefits referred to in Articles  24  to  34,  in  accordance  with
        national procedures and  as  far  as  it  is  compatible  with  the
        personal legal status of the family member. In so far as the family
        members  of  beneficiaries  of  subsidiary  protection  status  are
        concerned, Member States may define the  conditions  applicable  to
        such benefits. In these cases, Member States shall ensure that  any
        benefits provided guarantee an adequate standard of living.


        3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 are not applicable where the family member is
        or would be excluded from refugee or subsidiary  protection  status
        pursuant to Chapters III and V.


        4. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, Member  States  may  refuse,
        reduce or withdraw the benefits referred  therein  for  reasons  of
        national security or public order.


        5. Member States may decide that this Article also applies to other
        close relatives who lived together as part of  the  family  at  the
        time of leaving the country of  origin,  and  who  were  wholly  or
        mainly dependent  on  the  beneficiary  of  refugee  or  subsidiary
        protection status at that time."




    Per Article 3:


        "More favourable standards
        Member States may introduce or retain more favourable standards for
        determining who qualifies as a refugee or as a person eligible  for
        subsidiary  protection,  and  for  determining   the   content   of
        international  protection,  in  so  far  as  those  standards   are
        compatible with this Directive."


19. The governing legal framework is completed by certain well  established
    principles of domestic, international and European human rights law.  I
    summarise these in no particular hierarchical order.  First,  there  is
    the familiar principle that every state has the right to control  entry
    into and stay in its territory, sometimes described as the "sovereignty
    principle", which finds expression in the opinion of  Lord  Bingham  of
    Cornhill in R (Bapio Action Limited) v  SSHD [2008] 1 AC 1003, at [4]:

         "It is one of the oldest powers of  a  sovereign  state  to  decide
         whether any, and if so which, non-nationals shall be  permitted  to
         enter its territory and to regulate and enforce the terms on  which
         they may do so."

    The Strasbourg decisions belonging to this sphere give emphasis to  the
    consideration  that  the  central  issue  in  these  appeals  is   that
    formulated in [10] above. Thus, in one of its  leading  pronouncements,
    the ECtHR has stated:


         "The Court reiterates that in the  context  of  both  positive  and
         negative obligations, the State must strike a fair balance  between
         the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a
         whole.  However, in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin
         of appreciation. Moreover, Article 8  does  not  entail  a  general
         observation for a  State  to  respect  immigrant's  choice  of  the
         country of their residence and to authorise family reunion  in  its
         territory."

         See Rodrigues v The Netherlands [2007] 44 EHRR 34, paragraph [39].

20. The margin of appreciation enjoyed by the  State  in  this  context  is
    emphasised in Draon v France [2006] 42 EHRR 40, where, in a  moderately
    detailed treatise, the Grand Chamber pronounced at [105] - [108]:

        "1.  While the essential object of Article 8  is  to  protect  the
        individual   against   arbitrary   interference   by   the   public
        authorities, it does not merely require the State to  abstain  from
        such interference: there may in addition  be  positive  obligations
        inherent in effective "respect" for  family  life.  The  boundaries
        between the State's positive and negative  obligations  under  this
        provision do not always  lend  themselves  to  precise  definition;
        nonetheless,  the  applicable  principles  are  similar.  In   both
        contexts regard must be had to the fair  balance  that  has  to  be
        struck between the competing interests of the  individual  and  the
        community as a whole, and in both contexts the State is  recognised
        as enjoying a certain margin of  appreciation  (see,  for  example,
        Nuutinen v. Finland, no. 32842/96, 27 June 2000, � 127, and Kutzner
        v. Germany,  no. 46544/99,  26  February  2002,  ��  61  and  62).
        Furthermore, even in relation to the positive  obligations  flowing
        from the first paragraph, "in striking [the required]  balance  the
        aims mentioned  in  the  second  paragraph  may  be  of  a  certain
        relevance" (see Powell and Rayner v. the United  Kingdom,  judgment
        of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, � 41).


        2.  "Respect" for family life ... implies an  obligation  for  the
        State to act in a manner calculated to  allow  ties  between  close
        relatives to develop normally (see Marckx, cited above, � 45).  The
        Court has held that a State is under this type of obligation  where
        it has found a direct  and  immediate  link  between  the  measures
        requested by an applicant, on the one hand, and his private  and/or
        family life on  the  other  (see  Airey  v.  Ireland,  judgment  of
        9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, � 32; X and Y v. the Netherlands,
        judgment of 26 March 1985, Series A no. 91, p. 11,  �  23;  L�pez
        Ostra v. Spain, judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 303-C, p.
        55, � 55; Guerra and Others v. Italy, judgment of 19 February 1998,
        Reports 1998-I, p. 227, � 58;  Botta  v.  Italy,  judgment  of  24
        February 1998, Reports 1998-I, � 35; and Zehnalova  and  Zehnal  v.
        the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 38621/97, ECHR 2002-V).


        3.  However, since the concept of respect is not precisely defined,
        States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in determining the steps
        to be taken to ensure  compliance  with  the  Convention  with  due
        regard  to  the  needs  and  resources  of  the  community  and  of
        individuals (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali  v.  the  United
        Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985,  Series  A  no.  94,  �  67,  and
        Zehnalova and Zehnal, cited above).


        4.  At the same  time,  the  Court  reiterates  the  fundamentally
        subsidiary role of the Convention. The  national  authorities  have
        direct democratic legitimation and are, as the Court  has  held  on
        many occasions, in principle better placed  than  an  international
        court to evaluate local needs and  conditions  (see,  for  example,
        Handyside v. the United  Kingdom,  judgment  of  7  December  1976,
        Series A no. 24, p. 22, � 48, and Hatton and Others v. the  United
        Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, � 97, ECHR 2003-VIII).  In  matters  of
        general policy, on which opinions within a democratic  society  may
        reasonably differ widely, the role  of  the  domestic  policy-maker
        should be given special weight."

21. In decision making contexts in which the public  interest  engaged  has
    the democratic stamp of parliamentary scrutiny,  debate  and  decision,
    culminating in primary legislation, the public interest  is  especially
    strong  and  the  role  of  the  court  or  tribunal  as   arbiter   of
    proportionality is correspondingly reduced: see  SS  (Nigeria)  v  SSHD
    [2013] EWCA Civ 550, per Laws LJ at [42]:

         "But the margin of discretionary judgment enjoyed  by  the  primary
         decision maker, though variable, means that  the  Court's  role  is
         kept in balance with that of the elected  arms  of  government  and
         this serves to quieten  constitutional  anxieties  that  the  Human
         Rights Act draws the Judges onto  ground  they  should  not  occupy
         ....."


         [and at 47]:


         "Upon the question whether the principle of minimal interference is
         fulfilled, the primary decision maker enjoys a variable  margin  of
         discretion, at its broadest  where  the  decision  applies  general
         policy created by primary legislation."

    The  variable  nature  of  the  primary  decision  maker's  margin   of
    appreciation, or discretionary area of judgment, is  illustrated  in  R
    (Quila)  v  SSHD [2012] 1 AC 621 where the legal  rule  in  play  which
    precluded the claimants from securing leave to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom was a provision of the  Immigration  Rules  which  do  not,  of
    course, have the  status  of  parliamentary  legislation  and  do  not,
    therefore, attract the equivalent imprimatur  of  democratic  approval:
    Huang  v  SSHD [2007] 2 AC 167, at [17]. Furthermore, it is appropriate
    for the court or tribunal to take into account whether the Secretary of
    State had access to  "special  sources  of  knowledge  and  advice"  in
    formulating the rule or rules under scrutiny: per Lord  Wilson  JSC  at
    [46].


22. Moreover, as noted by this Tribunal recently in ZAT and Others  v  SSHD
    (Article 8 ECHR - Dublin Regulation - Interface - Proportionality)  IJR
    [2016] UKUT 61 (IAC), after [57]:


         "Lesser weight is to  be  accorded  to  the  Secretary  of  State's
         assessment to the balance to be struck between the public  interest
         and the  rights  of  the  individual  in  circumstances  where  the
         Secretary of State's insistence upon full adherence to the [rule in
         question] embodies a generalised assessment, a broad brush,  to  be
         contrasted with a specific, considered response and decision  on  a
         case by case basis."


    The ensuing sentence in the same paragraph  resonates,  as  it  applies
    fully to the present appeals:


         "....  The platform upon which the Secretary of State has contested
         these  proceedings   is   quite   unrelated   to   the   individual
         circumstances,  the  needs  and  merits  of  any   of   the   seven
         Applicants."

     As in ZAT  and  Others,  the  present  proceedings  concern  a  blanket
    exclusion, or prohibition.

23. In Secretary of State for the Home Department  v  SS (Congo) and Others
    [2015] EWCA Civ 387 the Court of Appeal paid specific attention to  the
    factor of children in the context of applications for  leave  to  enter
    and leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom.   Having  noted  that  the
    "Article 8 code", contained in Appendix FM to  the  Immigration  Rules,
    constituted an "attempt" by the Secretary of  State  to  reflect  "more
    precisely than before" the relevant balance to be  struck  between  the
    public interest and the interests of the individual in Article 8 cases,
    the Court formulated some general principles in  [39].   These  include
    the principle, expressed in [39](iii) that:

         "A Court will be slow to find an implied positive obligation  which
         would  involve  imposing  on  the  State   significant   additional
         expenditure,  which  will  necessarily  involve  a   diversion   of
         resources  from  other  activities  of  the  State  in  the  public
         interest, a matter which  usually  calls  for  consideration  under
         democratic procedures".

         This is followed immediately by the following passage:

        "(iv) On the other hand, the fact that the interests of a child are
        in issue will be a countervailing factor which tends to  reduce  to
        some degree the width of the margin of appreciation which the state
        authorities would otherwise enjoy. Article 8 has to be  interpreted
        and applied in the light of the UN Convention on the Rights of  the
        Child (1989): see In re E (Children)  (Abduction:  Custody  Appeal)
        [2011] UKSC 27; [2012] AC 144, at [26]. However, the fact that  the
        interests of a child are in issue does not simply provide  a  trump
        card so that a child applicant for positive action to be  taken  by
        the state in the field of  Article  8(1)  must  always  have  their
        application acceded to; see In re  E  (Children)  at  [12]  and  ZH
        (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC
        4; [2011] 2  AC  166,  at  [25]  (under  Article  3(1)  of  the  UN
        Convention on the Rights of the Child the interests  of  the  child
        are a primary consideration - i.e. an important matter  -  not  the
        primary consideration). It is a factor relevant to the fair balance
        between the individual and the general community  which  goes  some
        way towards tempering the otherwise  wide  margin  of  appreciation
        available to the state authorities in deciding what to do. The  age
        of the child, the closeness of their relationship  with  the  other
        family member in the United Kingdom and whether  the  family  could
        live together elsewhere are likely to be  important  factors  which
        should be borne in mind."

    The Court further noted that  Article  3(1)  of  UNCRC  forms  part  of
    municipal law via section 55 of the 2009 Act, in observing that some of
    the principles and obligations  contained  in  this  international  law
    measure have influenced domestic law.

24. There is a further, discrete dimension of the Article  8  jurisprudence
    which the Court of Appeal noted en passant in SS (Congo),  at  [39](v),
    namely the principle, or test,  of  the  "direct  and  immediate  link"
    forging a nexus between the measures requested by an applicant and  his
    family life. This principle approximates to  the  familiar  common  law
    concept of casual nexus.   In  Draon   v   France  (supra),  the  Grand
    Chamber, having reiterated certain well established principles,  stated
    at [106]:

         "'Respect' for family life .... implies an obligation for the State
         to act in a manner calculated to allow ties between close relatives
         to develop normally.  The Court has held that a State is under this
         type of obligation where it has found a direct and  immediate  link
         between the measures requested by an Applicant, on  the  one  hand,
         and his private and/or family life on the other."

    This direct and immediate link is unlikely to be established in
    circumstances where family life can be carried on elsewhere: see Botta
    v  Italy [1998] 26 EHRR 241 and G�l  v  Switzerland [1996] 22 EHRR 93,
    at [42].

25. The scope for further development and  refinement  of  the  principles,
    tests and touchstones to be applied in Article 8 cases of  this  genre,
    in the  context  of  what  is  of  course  a  "living  instrument",  is
    illustrated by a trilogy of decisions of the ECtHR.  It is  unnecessary
    to dwell on the first of these, Sen  v  Netherlands [2003] 36  EHRR  7.
    In the second, Tuquabo-Tekle and Others  v  Netherlands [2005] ECHR 803
    [Application No 60665/00], which followed two years  later,  the  Court
    emphasised, firstly, that every case is fact  sensitive:  see  [43](a).
    In formulating an inexhaustive list of touchstones to  be  applied,  it
    highlighted the age of the children concerned, their current  situation
    in their country of origin and the extent of their dependency on  their
    parents.  In [47] it formulated the test of "the  most  adequate  means
    for the various members to develop family  life  together".  The  Court
    also acknowledged, in [49], the relevance of the age of  the  child  or
    children concerned, the extent of the child/parent dependency,  whether
    the child had been reared in the cultural and linguistic environment of
    his country of origin, whether there are relatives there and whether it
    could be expected of the parents to return there: see [49].

26. This was followed by Mayeka and Mitunga  v  Belgium [2008] 46  EHRR  23
    in which the main factors were pre-existing  family  life  between  the
    separated  persons  concerned,  an  unaccompanied  minor  and   special
    vulnerability. Both decisions illustrate the  Court's  willingness,  in
    appropriate cases, to recognise Article  8  ECHR  as  the  vehicle  for
    achieving family reunification on  the  territory  of  the  Council  of
    Europe State where one of the family members is present or established.



27. As the sponsor was a child (aged 17) when the impugned decisions of the
    ECO were made, section 55 of the 2009 Act  applied.   Accordingly,  his
    best interests had the status of a primary  consideration.   As  in  so
    many cases involving children, there is no evidence that the  statutory
    duty imposed by section 55(2)  to  have  regard  to  the  Secretary  of
    State's statutory guidance was discharged.  I readily infer that it was
    not. This, sadly, seems to be the rule rather  than  the  exception  in
    cases of this kind.  This, notwithstanding that the decisions  of  this
    Tribunal in JO and Others (Section 55 Duty)  Nigeria  [2014]  UKUT  517
    (IAC) and MK (Section 55 - Tribunal Options) [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC) have
    drawn attention emphatically to this aspect, and others, of section 55.



28. Section 55 has been considered by the United Kingdom Supreme  Court  in
    ZH (Tanzania)  v  SSHD [2011] 2 AC 166 and Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] 1  WLR
    3690.  As these decisions make clear, no other  material  consideration
    can be treated as inherently more significant than the  best  interests
    of any affected child, albeit this can be outweighed by the  cumulative
    effect of other considerations and it does not rank as the primary,  or
    paramount, consideration. Per Lord Kerr in ZH (Tanzania) at [46]:

         "It is not merely one consideration  that  weighs  in  the  balance
         along side other competing factors.  Where the  best  interests  of
         the child clearly favour a certain course, that  course  should  be
         followed  unless  countervailing  reasons  of  considerable   force
         displace them."

    Notably, while  section  55  did  not  apply  directly  to  the  second
    Appellant when the decisions were made, as he was  outside  the  United
    Kingdom, the Secretary of State's Immigration  Directorate  Instruction
    ("IDI") invites ECOs to consider the aforementioned statutory guidance,
    as noted  by  this  Tribunal  in  Mundeba  (Section  55  and  paragraph
    297(i)(f)) [2013] UKUT 88 (IAC),  at  [36]  and  [37]  especially:  see
    further [31] infra.

29. The issue of  the  status  of  unincorporated  or  partly  incorporated
    international treaties in domestic law continues to intrigue.   It  has
    proved nothing if not organic during recent years.   The  determination
    of these appeals does not  require  a  detailed  treatise.  Rather,  it
    suffices to draw attention to three matters.  The first is the  opinion
    of Lord Wilson in  Mathieson   v   Secretary  of  State  for  Work  and
    Pensions [2015] UKSC 47, at [42] - [44], which  merit  reproduction  in
    full:


        "[42] In ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
        [2011] UKSC 4, [2011] 2 AC 166, Lady Hale at para  21  quoted  with
        approval the observation of the  Grand  Chamber  of  the  ECtHR  in
        Neulinger v Switzerland (2010) 28 BHRC 706,  para  131,  that  "the
        Convention  cannot  be  interpreted  in  a  vacuum  but   must   be
        interpreted in harmony with the general principles of international
        law".  The  Court  of   Appeal   concluded,   however,   that   the
        circumstances of the present case left no room for  either  of  the
        international  conventions  to  give  a   steer   to   the   proper
        interpretation  of  Cameron's  rights.   Consistently   with   that
        conclusion, the Secretary of State proceeds to submit that it is in
        principle illegitimate to have regard to  the  conventions  and  in
        this regard he relies upon the recent decision of this court in the
        SG case cited at para 39 above.


        [43] It is clear that  in  the  SG  case  the  Secretary  of  State
        submitted  that,  while  an  international  covenant  might  inform
        interpretation of a substantive right conferred by the  Convention,
        it had no  role  in  the  interpretation  of  the  parasitic  right
        conferred by article 14 and thus,  specifically,  no  role  in  any
        inquiry into justification for any difference of treatment  in  the
        enjoyment of the substantive rights. But  his  submission  was  not
        upheld. While Lord Reed did not expressly  rule  upon  it,  it  was
        rejected by Lord Carnwath (paras 113-119), by  Lord  Hughes  (paras
        142-144), by Lady Hale (paras 211-218) and by Lord Kerr (paras 258-
        262). Lord Carnwath, for example, pointed out at paras 117-119 that
        the Secretary of State's submission ran counter to observations  in
        the Court of Appeal in the Burnip case, cited at para 23 above, and
        indeed to the decision of the Grand Chamber in X v  Austria  (2013)
        57 EHRR 405. The decision of the majority in the SG  case  was  not
        that   international   conventions   were   irrelevant    to    the
        interpretation of article 14 but that  the  UN  Convention  on  the
        Rights of the Child  was  irrelevant  to  the  justification  of  a
        difference of treatment visited upon  women  rather  than  directly
        upon children: para 89 (Lord Reed), paras 129-131  (Lord  Carnwath)
        and para 146 (Lord Hughes).


        [44] The noun adopted by the Grand Chamber in the  Neulinger  case,
        cited above, is "harmony". A conclusion, reached without  reference
        to international conventions,  that  the  Secretary  of  State  has
        failed  to  establish  justification  for  the  difference  in  his
        treatment of those severely disabled children who are  required  to
        remain in hospital for a lengthy  period  would  harmonise  with  a
        conclusion that his different  treatment  of  them  violates  their
        rights under two international conventions."


    In short, certain provisions of international treaties,  in  particular
    the UNCRC, have gently, seamlessly  and  progressively  influenced  and
    seasoned domestic law via the Human Rights Act 1998, as a result of the
    duty imposed on courts and tribunals by section 3(1)  thereof  and  the
    long established practice of the ECtHR of taking into account  relevant
    provisions of international law.


30. Second, bearing in mind section 55 of the 2009 Act, it  is  clear  that
    Article 3(1) of UNCRC cannot be considered in a vacuum,  isolated  from
    the remaining provisions of the Convention.  The meaning and  reach  of
    Article 3(1) must take their colour from, and  be  informed  by,  other
    provisions of this instrument. Article 31 of the Vienna  Convention  on
    the Law of Treaties requires no less.   It provides, in material part:


         "General rule of interpretation
        1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in  accordance  with
        the ordinary meaning to be given to the  terms  of  the  treaty  in
        their context and in the light of its object and purpose.
        2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation  of  a  treaty
        shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and
        annexes ....   "


31. Third, decisions which  give  proper  effect  to  both  of  the  duties
    enshrined  in  section   55   may   legitimately   be   influenced   by
    unincorporated provisions of international law, having  regard  to  the
    expression of the Secretary of State's policy in the statutory guidance
    made under section 55(2).  This  is  found  in  "Every  Child  Matters:
    Change For Children", which contains, at paragraph 2.6,  the  following
    passage:

         "The UK Border Agency acknowledges the status and importance of the
         following: the European Convention  for  the  Protection  of  Human
         Rights and Fundamental  Freedoms,  the  International  Covenant  on
         Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic,
         Social and Cultural Rights, the EU Reception Conditions  Directive,
         the Council of Europe Convention on Action against  Trafficking  in
         Human Beings and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The
         UK Border Agency must fulfil the requirements of these  instruments
         in  relation  to  children  whilst  exercising  its  functions   as
         expressed in UK domestic legislation and policies."

         [Emphasis added]

    Within this passage one finds the clearest of  assurances  that,  as  a
    matter of policy, these several instruments of international  law  will
    be given effect when the Secretary of State and her various alter egos,
    which include UKBA, UKVI and ECOs, are making immigration (and related)
    decisions  which  affect  children.   Moreover,  the  absence  of   any
    territorial limitation comparable to that contained in section 55(1) is
    notable.


32. Thus the principle enunciated in R v  Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department, ex parte Launder [1997] 1 WLR 839 applies  fully.  Applying
    orthodox principles of public law, it matters not that  the  materials,
    or considerations, identified in "Every Child Matters (etc)"  have  the
    status of unincorporated international treaties.  If  this  publication
    had the standing of a (mere)  governmental  policy,  the  Secretary  of
    State would be expected to give effect to  it:  Lumba  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2011]  UKSC 12 at [26], per  Lord  Dyson
    JSC. I consider that this  duty  applies  a  fortiori  given  that  the
    publication is an instrument made pursuant to a duty imposed by primary
    legislation.  By formulating the statutory guidance  in  this  way  the
    executive has chosen to give indirect status in domestic law to certain
    measures of international law  which  have  not  been  incorporated  by
    legislation.


33. The international law/domestic law  dichotomy  in  United  Kingdom  law
    traditionally conjured  up  notions  of  polarisation  and  insularity.
    Having regard to the developments mapped above, the  gulf  between  the
    two  notional  extremes  has  narrowed  significantly   and   this   is
    illustrated by the decision making  context  under  scrutiny  in  these
    proceedings.  The  so-called  dualist  doctrine  has  evolved  and  has
    undergone some dilution in consequence.  All of this is, ultimately,  a
    reflection of the intrinsically organic nature of the common law.

Conclusions

34. At this juncture I remind myself of  the  fundamental  question  to  be
    determined in these conjoined appeals: is  the  interference  with  the
    family life of the Appellants and  M,  brought  about  by  the  refusal
    decisions of the ECO, a proportionate means of securing the  legitimate
    aims in play?  Or, alternatively, one might ask which  is  to  prevail:
    the interests of the three family members or the public interest?

35. On one side of the scales there is a strong family unit  whose  members
    are clearly united and fortified by strong bonds of love, affection and
    interdependency.  They long to be reunited and have gone to substantial
    lengths and have made considerable sacrifices  to  achieve  this  goal.
    For as long as separation continues, this  will  be  a  disfunctioning,
    debilitated and under achieving family.  The main feature of this under
    achievement will be the family's inability to attain its  potential  as
    one of the key elements of modern societies throughout the world.   The
    under performance of family members and family units, in this  respect,
    does not further any identifiable public interest.  On the contrary  it
    is antithetical to strong and stable societies.  These  features of the
    family unit under scrutiny in these appeals are exposed  in  a  context
    where M, being  the  older  of  the  two  male  sons,  is,  culturally,
    considered to be the head of the family. This  family,  bereft  of  its
    natural head by circumstances and not by choice, is now deprived of his
    successor and has been thus bereft for almost four years.

36. The evidence establishes clearly that the sponsor is under achieving as
    a person.  This means that his contribution, actual and  potential,  to
    United Kingdom society is diminished.   This  arises  in  circumstances
    where he has demonstrated his willingness to adapt  to  United  Kingdom
    culture and to study earnestly in this alien country.   The  prediction
    that society will secure some benefit if the  sponsor  achieves  family
    reunification in this country is readily made.  Thus reunification will
    promote, rather than undermine, the public interest  in  this  respect.
    It will be manifestly better for society than maintenance of the status
    quo.

37. Furthermore, if family reunification cannot be achieved in  the  United
    Kingdom, M will be  driven  to  consider  alternatives,  some  of  them
    manifestly dangerous given his youth and unaccompanied and  unsupported
    status. These include the precarious journey involved in attempting  to
    reunite with the Appellants wherever  they  may  be  at  present.   The
    evidence points to the probability that they are either in Khartoum  or
    the UNHCR refugee camp several hundred kilometres away.  The situations
    in both locations are fraught with danger and imbued with  deprivation.
    Reunification of this family in their country of  origin,  Eritrea,  is
    not a feasible possibility, having  regard  to  the  factual  framework
    rehearsed in [5] - [9] above.

38. I consider it distinctly possible that if family  reunification  cannot
    be secured in the United Kingdom, the sponsor will depart these  shores
    in the dangerous pursuit of one of the alternatives mooted above.  This
    would deprive him of the protections which he has obtained as a  result
    of being recognised a refugee. This would be manifestly undesirable for
    him,  contrary  to  the  public  interest  and  incompatible  with  the
    philosophy and rationale of  the  Refugee  Convention.  It  would  also
    expose him to a risk of violating his Convention rights, in  particular
    those protected by Articles 3 and 4.  In the real world, recognition of
    this possibility is far from fanciful. I consider this to be  a  potent
    factor in the balancing exercise. Resort to this Tribunal is very  much
    a measure of last resort for him.

39. Next, it is necessary to give effect to the  principles  enunciated  in
    Mathieson - (supra) together with those aspects  of  the  Secretary  of
    State's statutory guidance noted in [31] above.  I do not  deduce  from
    any of these principles or sources that the Secretary of State is under
    a duty to facilitate  reunification  for  this  family  in  the  United
    Kingdom with the result that the impugned  decisions  of  the  ECO  are
    vitiated.  The existence of an absolute duty of  this  nature  was  not
    argued and I do not consider that such duty exists. However, in my view
    the orientation of these principles and policies is to  favour,  rather
    than undermine, what the Appellants seek to achieve by  these  appeals.
    They qualify for substantial weight in  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise.

40. On the other side of the scales lies the public interest.  This engages
    the provisions in sections 117A and 117B of the 2002 Act, reproduced in
    [13] above.  Thus, in summary: the public interest in  the  maintenance
    of effective immigration controls  is  engaged;  I  shall  assume  that
    neither of the Appellants speaks English; and  I  further  assume  that
    neither Appellant is, or will be, financially independent, at least for
    the foreseeable future.  Section  117B(4)  does  not  apply.  Nor  does
    section 117B(5), given the concession - properly made - of Mr Poole  on
    behalf of the Secretary of State that the M's immigration status in the
    United Kingdom has not been precarious, given the grant of  five  years
    leave to remain qua refugee. Nor does section 117B(6) apply.

41. Is any other public  interest  engaged?   Mr  Poole,  in  his  skeleton
    argument, sought to identify two such interests:

    (a)  the safeguarding of children, specifically those in  the  position
         of  the  sponsor,  who  would  be  at  risk  of   trafficking   and
         exploitation in their quest to reach the United Kingdom; and

     (b) additional pressure on publicly funded childrens' services.

    There is no primary legislation underpinning either of  these  asserted
    public interests.  Moreover, there is no evidence underlying them -  in
    the form of, for example, reports or commentaries.   I  recognise  that
    evidence of this kind is not a prerequisite to  the  recognition  of  a
    public interest in the Article 8(2)  balancing  exercise.   However,  I
    cannot overlook that these public interests are  advanced  through  the
    medium of counsel's written and oral submissions.


42. Furthermore, this unsatisfactory dimension of the Secretary of  State's
    case is highlighted by the  belated production of certain data.   While
    I have considered this material, I observe that it does  not  have  the
    benefit of related  reports  or  the  illumination  or  elaboration  of
    witness statements.  Nor is there any financial data even at a  general
    level.  In  addition,  the  figures  require  clarification,  which  is
    lacking.  In my judgment, the only conclusion which can safely be  made
    is that there has been some increase in  the  advent  of  unaccompanied
    children to the United Kingdom during the past two years.   That  said,
    the figures are substantially smaller  than  those  applicable  to  the
    years 2008 and 2009.  While I take  all  of  this  evidence,  including
    counsel's submissions, into account, I consider  that  its  potency  is
    questionable for  the  reasons  given.   Furthermore,  I  reiterate  my
    analysis of the governing legal principles above.

43. This brings me to my overarching conclusion. Taking  into  account  the
    considerations, assessments and reasons highlighted   in  [34]  -  [42]
    above, it is my conclusion that,  balancing  everything,  the  impugned
    decisions of the ECO, acting on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State,
    interfere disproportionately with the right to respect for family  life
    enjoyed  by  the  Appellants  and  M.  As  the  ultimate   arbiter   of
    proportionality I decide accordingly.  Thus I re-make the  decision  of
    the FtT by allowing the appeals.

    Decision


    The appeals are allowed under Article 8 ECHR.

       It is the duty of Government and of society as a whole to keep
       children safe. Public agencies have a particular responsibility to
       do this, both within their own area of business and in the way in
       which they work together.

       Section 11 of the Children Act 2004 places a duty on specified
       public bodies and key individuals to carry out their functions
       having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of
       children. This applies across a wide range of public activity, from
       schools to prisons.

       Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 now
       places a similar duty on the UK Border Agency. This is a natural
       progression for the Agency which has been steadily improving how it
       works with children. Last year, the Government lifted its general
       reservation relating to immigration on the UN Convention on the
       Rights of the Child, and in January of this year we introduced
a statutory Code of Practice for the UK Border Agency on Keeping Children
Safe from Harm. The Code is superseded by this new duty which now places
the UK Border Agency on the same footing as other public bodies working
with children.

As Ministers for Immigration and Children, we welcome this coming together
and are confident that it will help to support more effective joint
working.

The UK Border Agency undertakes difficult and sensitive work on behalf of
society as a whole. Working with children presents particular challenges.
To meet these challenges effectively, the UK
Border Agency needs the support of all those with an interest in children.
The development of this guidance has been greatly assisted by the input of
a range of organisations outside Government. We are grateful for this and
look forward to continued co-operation to achieve the better outcomes for
children which we all want to see.

       INTRODUCTION










       1.     Improving the way key people and bodies safeguard and promote
           the welfare of children is crucial to improving outcomes for
           children.

       2.     Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship
           and Immigration Act 2009 (the 2009 Act) therefore places a duty
           on the Secretary of State to make arrangements for ensuring that
           immigration, asylum, nationality and customs functions are
           discharged having regard to the need to safeguard and promote
           the welfare of children in the UK. A similar duty is placed on
           the Director of Border Revenue in respect of the Director's
           functions.

       3.     The guidance sets out the key arrangements for safeguarding
           and promoting the welfare of children as they apply both
           generally to public bodies who deal with children (Part 1) and
           specifically to the UK Border Agency (Part
           2). These arrangements  will help agencies to create and
           maintain the right organisational ethos for working with
           children. They include:

            .  Senior  management   commitment   to   the   importance   of
              safeguarding and promoting children's welfare;

            . A clear statement of the agency's responsibilities towards
              children available for all staff;

            . A clear line of accountability within the organisation for
              work on safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children;

            . Service  developments  that  take  account  of  the  need  to
              safeguard  and  promote  welfare  and   is   informed,   where
              appropriate, by the views of children and families;

            . Staff training on safeguarding and promoting the welfare of
              children for
       all staff working with or in contact with children and families;

     . Safe recruitment procedures in place;

     . Effective inter-agency working to safeguard and promote the welfare
       the children, and

     . Effective information sharing.

4.   Section 55 is intended to achieve the same effect as section 11 of the
    Children Act 2004 (the 2004 Act) which places a similar duty
    on other public organisations1. As well as providing a driver for
    improvement within the UK Border Agency, the duty will also help to
    improve inter-agency working in respect of children. Section 55 applies
    to the carrying out of the relevant functions anywhere in the UK.


THE ROLE AND STATUS  OF THIS GUIDANCE

5.   This guidance is aimed at staff of the UK Border Agency and
    contractors when carrying out UK Border Agency functions. It sets
    out the key arrangements for safeguarding and promoting the welfare of
    children. The guidance is modelled on the guidance which supports
    section 11 of the 2004 Act2. It is
    in two parts. Part 1 describes the general arrangements to safeguard and
    promote the welfare of children which are likely to be common to all
    agencies covered by section
    11 and, in the case of the UK Border Agency, by section 55.  Part  1  is
    intended to make clear how the work of the UK Border Agency fits


1    For the full list of bodies covered by Section 11 see paragraph
  1.1 of the guidance below.
2    Statutor y Guidance on making arrangements to safeguard and promote
  the welfare of children under section 11 of the Children Act 2004 updated
  March 2007. Issued by DCSF and available at www.dcsf.gov.uk/ever
  ychildmatters/_download/?id=1372



           into the wider arrangements, although not all of Part 1 is
           directly relevant to it. Part 2 sets out how those general
           arrangements apply specifically to the UK Border Agency.

       6.     This guidance is issued under section 55 (3) and 55 (5) which
           requires any person exercising immigration, asylum, nationality
           and customs functions to have regard to the
           guidance given to them for the purpose by the Secretary of
           State. This means they must take this guidance into account and,
           if
           they decide to depart from it, have clear reasons for doing so.

       7.     Where private or voluntary organisations are commissioned to
           provide services on behalf of the UK Border Agency, the
           agreement under which the arrangements are made should require
           that the private or voluntary organisation concerned takes this
           guidance
           into account in the provision of those services and, if they
           decide to depart from it, have
           clear reasons for doing so.

       8.     The guidance does not replace any current operational
           instructions and should be read alongside them.


       TIMETABLE

       9.     The commencement date for section 55 of
           the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act
           2009 was 2 November 2009.


       PART 1
       UNDERSTANDING THE DUTY TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO SAFEGUARD AND PROMOTE
       THE WELFARE OF CHILDREN



       1.1.  Section 11 of the 2004 Act places a duty on key people and
           bodies in England to make arrangements to ensure that their
           functions are discharged with regard to the need to safeguard
           and promote the welfare of children. Section 28 of the Act
           requires similar bodies in Wales to do the same. The
           application of this duty will vary according to the nature of
           each agency and its functions. The key people and bodies that
           are covered by the duty are:

            . local authorities, including district councils;

            . the police;

            . the probation service;

            . NHS bodies(Strategic Health Authorities, Designated Special
              Health Authorities, Primary Care Trusts, NHS Trusts, Local
              Health Boards and NHS Foundation Trusts);

            . Organisations (currently the Connexions
                  Service) providing services under section
                  114 of the Learning and Skills Act 2007;
    Border Agency in an Act that deals directly with UK Border Agency work.
    It therefore appears in section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and
    Immigration Act 20093.

1.3.  The duty does not give the UK Border Agency any new functions, nor
    does it over- ride its existing functions. It does require the Agency to
    carry out its existing functions
    in a way that takes into account the need to safeguard and  promote  the
    welfare of children.

1.4.  Safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children is defined in the
    guidance to section
    11 of the 2004 Act (section 28 in Wales) and in Working Together to
    Safeguard Children4  as:

                  . protecting children from maltreatment;

     . preventing impairment of children's health or development (where
       health means 'physical or mental health' and development means
       'physical, intellectual, emotional, social or behavioural
       development');

            . Youth offending teams;

            . Governors / Directors of Prisons and
                        Young Offender Institutions;

            . Directors of Secure Training Centres;

            . The British Transport Police.

       1.2.  The UK Border Agency functions are not devolved, unlike those
           of the bodies listed
           in the 2004 Act, and so the Government has chosen to apply the
           duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children to the UK
  3    In Scotland the legislative provisions for protecting children and
  promoting their welfare are contained in the Protection of Children
  (Scotland) Act 2007 and the Children (Scotland) Act
  1995. The principles of co-operation and information sharing between
  agencies in the safeguarding of children are, however, impor tant themes
  in the legislative framework and guidance governing the deliver y of
  children's ser vices in Nor thern Ireland, where the legislative
  provisions are the Children (Nor thern Ireland) Order 1995, and the
  Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (Nor thern Ireland) Order 2007. In both
  jurisdictions Area
  Child Protection Committees are the means of providing local procedures
  and processes  for agencies to comply with the legislation to safeguard
  children and to co-operate together, and for anyone working with
  children.
4    The Welsh Assembly Government has produced its own version of "Working
  Together" with a definition that matches this albeit expressed in a dif
  ferent way. It is available at:
  http://cymru.gov.uk/pubs/circulars/2007/nafwc1207en. pdf?lang=en


            . ensuring that children are growing up in circumstances
              consistent with the provision of safe and effective care; and

            . undertaking that role so as to enable those children to  have
              optimum life chances and to enter adulthood successfully.

       1.5.  The overall framework set out in the 2004
           Act is to provide a basis for achieving the vision of
           safeguarding set out in the report Safeguarding Children5  i.e:

            . all agencies working with children, young people and their
              families take all reasonable measures to ensure that the risks
              of harm to children's welfare are minimised; and

            . where there are concerns about children and young people's
              welfare, all agencies take all appropriate actions to address
              those concerns, working to agreed local policies and
              procedures in partnership with other agencies.


       FRAMEWORK  FOR  MAKING  EFFECTIVE  ARRANGEMENTS  TO  SAFEGUARD   AND
       PROMOTE  CHILDREN'S  WELFARE

       1.6.  Each agency will have different contributions to make towards
           safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children depending on
           the functions for which they have responsibility. For example,
           the main contribution of some services might be to identify and
           act on their concerns about the welfare of children with whom
           they come into contact, perhaps during or following completion
           of a common assessment while others might be more involved in
           supporting a child once concerns have been identified. The UK
           Border Agency is among the former. There are some key features
           of effective arrangements to safeguard and promote the

         Probation (2002). Safeguarding Children - A Joint Chief

    welfare of children which all agencies will need to take account of in
    addition to those that are particular to its own work, when undertaking
    their particular functions. These arrangements will help agencies to
    create and maintain an organisational culture and ethos that reflects
    the importance of safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children.


STRATEGIC AND ORGANISATIONAL ARRANGEMENTS

1.7.  Many organisations subject to the section 11 duty (or in Wales the
    section 28 duty) are also required to take part in Local Safeguarding
    Children Boards (LSCBs). LSCBs are the
    key statutory mechanism for agreeing how the relevant organisations in
    each local
    area cooperate to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in that
    locality, and for ensuring their effectiveness. The Local Authority
    convenes and is also a member of the LSCB. The Board partners are set
    out in
    section 13(3) of the 2004 Act for England and in section 31(3) for
    Wales6. They are:

     . district councils in local government areas that have them;

     . the chief police officer for a police area of which any  part  falls
       within the area of the Local Authority;

     . the local probation board for an area of which any part falls within
       the area of the Local Authority;

     . the Youth Offending Team for an area of which any part falls  within
       the area of the Local Authority;



6    In Wales they are: the members a children's ser vices authority in
  Wales; a Local Health Board; an NHS trust all or most of whose hospitals,
  establishments and facilities are situated
  in Wales; the police authority and chief officer of police for a police
  area in Wales; the British Transpor t Police Authority, so far as
  exercising functions in relation to Wales; a local
  probation board for an area in Wales; a youth of fending team for an area
  in Wales; (h) the governor of a prison or secure training centre in Wales
  (or, in the case of a contracted out prison or secure training centre,
  its director); (i) any person
  to the extent that he is providing ser vices pursuant to arrangements
  made by a children's ser vices authority in Wales under section 123(1)(b)
  of the Learning and Skills Act
  2000 (c. 21) (youth suppor t ser vices).



            . Strategic Health Authorities and Primary
              Care Trusts for an area of which any  part  falls  within  the
              area of the Local Authority;

            . NHS Trusts and NHS Foundation Trusts, all or most of whose
              hospitals or establishments and facilities are situated in the
              Local Authority area;

            . the Connexions service operating in any part of the area of
              the Local Authority;

            . CAFCASS (Children and Family Courts
              Advisory and Support Service),

            . the Governor or Director of any Secure Training Centre in the
              area of the Local Authority; and

            . the Governor or Director of any prison
              in the Local Authority area that ordinarily detains children.

       1.8.  Other organisations can be involved in LSCB by agreement. The
           UK Border Agency is one of these. For details of how the UK
           Border Agency fits in with these arrangements see Part 2 of this
           guidance.

       1.9.  At an organisational or strategic level within individual
           agencies, key features for safeguarding and promoting the
           welfare of children are:


           a.  Senior  management   commitment   to   the   importance   of
           safeguarding and promoting children's  welfare

           Senior managers will need to demonstrate leadership, be informed
           about, and take responsibility for the actions of their staff
           who are providing services to children and their families. This
           could mean identifying a named person at senior management level
           to
           champion  the  importance  of  safeguarding  and  promoting  the
           welfare of children throughout the organisation. Senior managers
           will also
           be responsible for monitoring the actions
           of their staff to safeguard and promote the welfare of children.
           This includes ensuring
that children and young people are listened to appropriately and concerns
expressed about their or any other child's welfare
are taken seriously and responded to in an appropriate manner.


b. A clear statement of the agency's responsibilities towards children is
available for all staff

This should include any children in the care of the agencies, any with whom
they work directly and those with whom they come into contact. It could
form part of an agency's existing policy and/or procedures. All staff
should be made aware of their agency's policies and procedures on
safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and the importance of
listening to children and young people, particularly when they are
expressing concerns about either their own or other children's welfare.
Effective systems should be in place for children, staff and other people
to make a complaint where there are concerns that action  to  safeguard  and
promote a child's  welfare  has  not  been  taken  in  accordance  with  the
agency's procedures.


c. A clear line of accountability   within  the  organisation  for  work  on
safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children

It should be clear who has overall responsibility for the agency's
contribution to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and what
the lines of accountability are from each staff member up through the
organisation to the person with ultimate accountability for children's
welfare. It
should also be clear with whom each staff member should discuss, and to
whom they should report, any concerns about a child's welfare.
Responsibilities for safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children can
operate at three levels:

  i.  Individual, which can be encompassed within job descriptions;
  ii. Professional, which is governed by codes of conduct for different
    disciplines or by distinct guidance on the functions being carried out;
    and



             iii. Organisational,  with clear lines
               of accountability throughout the organisation to senior
               office level.


           d. Service development takes account  of the need to safeguard
           and promote welfare and is informed, where appropriate, by the
           views of children and families

           In developing services, those responsible should consider how
           the delivery of these services will take account of the need to
           safeguard and promote the welfare of children.


           e. Staff training on safeguarding and promoting the welfare of
           children for all staff working with or, depending on the
           agency's  primary functions,  in contact  with children and
           families

           Staff should have an understanding of both their roles and
           responsibilities and those of other professionals and
           organisations. This is essential for effective multi- and inter-
           agency collaboration. Agencies are encouraged to enable staff to
           participate in training provided on an inter-agency basis as
           well as in single agency training provided by the agency itself.
           Safeguarding and promoting the welfare
           of children is one of the six areas of the Common  Core of
           Skills and Knowledge for the Children's Workforce (2005)
           prospectus. This prospectus informs the training provided to all
           those working in children's services. Training on safeguarding
           and promoting the welfare of children should be relevant to the
           roles and responsibilities of each staff member.


           f. Safer recruitment

           Robust recruitment and vetting procedures must be in place to
           help prevent unsuitable people from working with children. This
           means thorough checks are carried out on all people as part of
           the recruitment process, and references are always taken up.
           People who recruit staff to work with children must have the
           appropriate training. The Safeguarding
g. Effective  inter-agency  working to safeguard and promote the welfare of
children

This involves agencies and staff working together to safeguard and promote
the welfare of children. Inter-agency working is crucial to ensuring the
effectiveness of such working. The sharing of information and constructive
relationships between individual members
of staff and teams should be supported by a strong lead from the Lead
Member for Children's Services, and Director of Children's Services and
commitment of all Chief
Officers. This effective working should be
at a strategic and an individual child level, in accordance with guidance
from their LSCB, regarding safeguarding children, or for the Prison
Service, in accordance with the policy agreed with the LSCB local to each
prison. The LSCB guidance should be consistent with the current statutory
guidance The Framework  for the Assessment of Children  in Need and their
Families (2000) and Working Together to Safeguard Children (2006). The
Government's practice guidance, What To Do If You're Worried A Child Is
Being Abused (HM Government 2006), is for use by practitioners and their
managers in all agencies to inform them about what to do when they have
concerns that a child may be a child in need, including concerns about a
child whom it
is believed is, or may be at risk of, suffering significant harm7. The UK
Border Agency contribution to inter-agency work is described in Part 2.


h. Information sharing

Effective information sharing by professionals is central to safeguarding
and promoting the welfare of children. It is therefore essential that
effective arrangements for sharing information about a child and their
family within each agency and between agencies are in place. This will
usually be set out in the form of a protocol or information sharing
agreement setting out
           Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 establishes a new
           vetting and barring scheme from October
           2009 for those who work with children and vulnerable adults.

           the process to be followed and the legal and security issues
           that need to be considered. However, the lack of an information
           sharing agreement between agencies should never
           be a reason for not sharing information that could help a
           practitioner deliver services to a child. The Welsh version of
           "Working Together" contains non-statutory guidance on good
           practice in information sharing.

           The decision to share or not to share information about a child
           should always be taken on a case by case basis based on
           professional judgement, supported by the cross-Government
           Information Sharing:
           Practitioners' Guide (published in April 2006)8 and in line with
           the provisions of the Data Protection Act and Human Rights Act
           1998 with consideration of any duty of confidence which is owed
           and the data security issues raised by the Cabinet Office
           guidelines on handling personal data. Full guidance on these
           issues is provided in Information Sharing: Practitioners' Guide
           (HM Government, 2006). The consent of children, young people and
           their caregivers should be obtained when sharing information
           unless to do so would place the child at risk of significant
           harm.

       1.10. In order to safeguard and promote children's welfare,
           arrangements should ensure that:

            . all staff in contact with children understand what to do and
              the most effective ways of sharing information if they believe
              that a child and family may require particular services in
              order to achieve their optimum outcomes;

            . all staff in contact with children understand what to do and
              when to share information if they believe that
              a child may be a child in need, including those children
              suffering or at risk of suffering harm;
       . appropriate agency-specific guidance is produced to complement
       guidance issued by central Government, and such guidance and
       appropriate training is made available to existing and new staff as
       part of their induction and ongoing training;

     . guidance and training specifically covers the sharing of information
       between professions, organisations and agencies, as well as within
       them, and arrangements for training take into account the value
       of multi-agency training as well as single agency training;

     . managers in children's services are fully conversant with the legal
       framework and good practice guidance issued for practitioners working
       with children.


CONTACT POINT9

1.11. Contact Point is a key part of the Every Child
    Matters programme to improve outcomes  for  children  and  will  support
    practitioners, local authorities and other organisations in
    fulfilling their duties to safeguard and promote the welfare of
    children. It is currently being delivered in phases that began in May
    2009
    and that are gradually being rolled out to other local authorities and
    partners. Contact Point will be the quick way to find out who else is
    working with the same child or young person and allow services to
    contact one another
    more efficiently. This basic online directory will be available to
    authorised staff who need it do their jobs.

1.12. Contact Point will not contain any detailed information (such as case
    notes, assessments, and clinical data or exam results). The legal
    framework for the operation of Contact Point is provided by regulations,
    made under section
    12 of the 2004 Act and further operational details are set out in
    Statutory Guidance that was published in late 2007.




       8    This is cross-government guidance that complements and suppor
         ts policies to improve information sharing across all ser vices.
         It is at
         www.dcsf.gov.uk/ever ychildmatters/_download/?id=103
                    9    Contact Point exists in England only.



       WORK WITH INDIVIDUAL  CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES

       1.13. The ways in which agencies work with or have contact with
           individual children and their families will differ depending on
           the functions of each agency. Some will focus on direct
           work with children and young people, whereas others will work
           with children and their families, and still others will work
           with adults with parenting responsibilities for children.

       1.14. In order to safeguard and promote the welfare of individual
           children, the following should
           be taken into account, in addition to the relevant section of
           Part 2 of this guidance. The key features of an effective system
           are:

            . Children and young people are listened to and what they have
              to say is taken seriously and acted on;
       . Following assessment, relevant services are provided to respond to
       the assessed needs of children and to support parents or carers in
       effectively undertaking their parenting roles. Wherever such services
       are being provided the UK Border Agency will take account of them in
       planning their future interaction with the family and the children.

1.15. The following principles underpin work
    with children and their families to safeguard and promote the welfare of
    children. They are relevant to varying degrees depending
    on the functions and level of involvement of the particular agency and
    the individual practitioner concerned. The UK Border Agency should seek
    to reflect them as appropriate.

1.16. Work with children and families should be:
            . Interventions take place at an early point when  difficulties
              or problems are identified;
. child centred;

. rooted in child development;
            . Where possible the wishes and feelings of the particular
              child are obtained and taken into account when deciding on
              action to be undertaken in relation to him or her.
              Communication is according to his or
              her preferred communication method or language;
 . supporting the achievement of the best possible outcomes for children
 and improving their wellbeing;

. holistic in approach;

. ensuring equality of opportunity;
            . Ethnic identity, language, religion, faith, gender and
              disability are taken into account when working with a child
              and their family;

            . Practitioners are clear when and how it is appropriate to
              make a referral to Local Authority children's services where
              children may need services to safeguard them or to promote
              their welfare;
 . involve children and families, taking their wishes and feelings into
 account;

. building on strengths as well as identifying and addressing difficulties;

. multi and inter-agency in its approach;

. a continuing process, not an event;
            . Where children are being provided with services to respond to
              their needs and support their welfare (usually by Local
              Authority children's services), professionals including the
              UK Border Agency contribute to subsequent plans,
              interventions and reviews in accordance with requirements in
              relevant regulations and guidance;
 . designed to identify and provide the services required, and monitor the
 impact their provision has on a child's developmental progress;

. informed by evidence.



       1.17. Some of these apply to specialised
           professional work, whilst others relate to more general work
           that can affect children.

           Ensuring equality of opportunity

           a. Equality of opportunity means that all children have the
           opportunity to achieve the best possible development. Some
           children may have been deprived of opportunities
           and assistance in early life and will, as a result, require
           services to meet their health and educational needs, to promote
           their immediate welfare so that they can achieve their potential
           into adulthood.

           Involvement of children and families

           b. In order to appreciate the child's needs and how they make
           sense of their circumstances it is important to listen and take
           account of their wishes and feelings. It is also important to
           develop a co-operative constructive working relationship with
           parents or caregivers so that they recognise that they are being
           respected and are being kept informed. Where there
           is respect and honesty in relating to parents they are likely to
           feel more confident about providing vital information about
           their child, themselves and their circumstances.

           Building on strengths as well as identifying difficulties

           c. Identifying both strengths and difficulties within the child,
           his or her family and the context in which they are living is
           important, as is considering how these factors have an impact on
           the child's health and development. Working with a child or
           family's strengths becomes an important part of a plan to
           resolve difficulties.

           Multi and Inter-agency in approach

           d. From birth, there will be a variety of different agencies and
           programmes in the community involved with children and their
           development, particularly in relation to their health and
           education. Multi and inter-agency work to safeguard and promote
           children's welfare starts as soon as there are concerns
    about a child's welfare, not just when there are questions about
    possible harm.

    A continuing process not an event

    e. Understanding what is happening to a vulnerable child within the
    context of his or her family and the local community, and taking
    appropriate action, are continuing
    and interactive processes, not single events. Assessment should continue
    throughout a period of intervention, and intervention may start at the
    beginning of an assessment.

    Providing and Reviewing services

    f. Action and services should be provided according to the identified
    needs of the child and family in parallel with assessment where
    necessary. It is not necessary to await completion of the assessment
    process. Immediate and practical needs should be
    addressed alongside more complex and longer term ones. The impact of
    service provision
    on a child's developmental progress should be reviewed.

    Informed by evidence

    g. Effective practice with children and families requires sound
    professional judgements which are underpinned by a rigorous evidence
    base, and draw on the practitioner's knowledge
    and experience.


INTER-AGENCY CO-OPERATION TO IMPROVE THE WELLBEING OF CHILDREN

1.18. A key aspect of the Every Child Matters: Change for Children
    programme is about encouraging relevant services to integrate around the
    needs of the child through children's trust arrangements10. To this end,
    section 10 of the 2004 Act places a duty
    on top tier and unitary local authorities in England to promote co-
    operation with a view to improving the wellbeing of children, and places
    a reciprocal duty on 'relevant partners'



10  A children's trust is the 'wrapper' that brings together all
  ser vices for children and young people in an area underpinned by the
  duty to cooperate that is in the Children Act 2004.




           to co-operate with the authority in the making of these
           arrangements11. Most of the strategic organisations covered by
           the section 11 (and section 28) duty are also under a duty to co-
            operate with the local authority in the making of co-operation
           arrangements (children's trust). Those that are not will however
           wish to engage with the local authority and partners where
           appropriate in the interests of promoting children's wellbeing.
           As a matter of law, the UK Border Agency is not subject to the
           duty in section 10, and details of the UK Border Agency
           contribution to inter-agency work is described in Part 2.


       MONITORING  AND INSPECTION OF ARRANGEMENTS TO SAFEGUARD  AND PROMOTE
        WELFARE

       1.19. Agencies' responsibilities for safeguarding and promoting the
           welfare of children, including the arrangements they make under
           section 11, will be monitored through the LSCB.

       1.20. Agencies, and the LSCB, are subject to independent assessment
           and inspection. The Framework for the Inspection of Children's
           Services, published in July 2005 by Ofsted
           on behalf of all relevant inspectorates  and commissions, sets
           out principles to be applied by an inspectorate or commission
           assessing any children's service, and defines the key judgements
           which, where appropriate and practical, inspections will seek to
           make12. It
           is available from www.ofsted.gov.uk. The key judgements include
           several relating to children and young people staying safe.

       1.21. Details of the arrangements that apply to the UK Border Agency
           are contained in Part 2 of this guidance.









       11  The relevant powers to improve cooperation and well-being are
         set out in s.25 for Wales, where children's trusts do not exist
         and which has taken a dif ferent approach to applying co-
         operation arrangements to that in England.
       12  The inspection body in Wales is Estyn which per forms a similar
         function to that of Ofsted in England.



       PART 2
       THE ROLE OF THE UK BORDER AGENCY IN RELATION TO SAFEGUARDING AND
       PROMOTING THE WELFARE OF CHILDREN



       INTRODUCTION

       2.1.  The UK Border Agency is an executive agency of the Home Office
           and its primary duties
           are to maintain a secure border, to detect and prevent border
           tax fraud, smuggling and immigration crime, and to ensure
           controlled, fair migration that protects the public and that
           contributes to economic growth and benefits the country.

       2.2.  It carries out these duties by applying and enforcing the
           Immigration Acts and the Immigration Rules, by having regard to
           policy guidance and instructions issued by the Secretary of
           State, and by exercising general customs functions as defined in
           the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act
           2009. The application and enforcement of the Immigration Acts
           includes removing from the UK persons who have no legal
           entitlement to remain in the UK and, in certain circumstances,
           detaining those individuals pending their removal from the UK.
           The UK Border
           Agency also has a role in granting protection
           to those who need it according to international conventions and
           the laws of the UK.

       2.3.  Within this legislative and policy framework, section 55 of
           the 2009 Act requires the Secretary of State to make
           arrangements to ensure that immigration, asylum, nationality and
           customs functions are exercised having regard to the need to
           safeguard and promote the welfare of children in the United
           Kingdom. The functions of the Director of Border Revenue must
           also be exercised having regard to the need to safeguard and
           promote the welfare of children in the United Kingdom. The duty
           does not create any new functions, nor does it over-ride any
           existing functions, rather it requires them to
           be carried out in a way that takes into account
    the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children.

2.4.   The  UK  Border  Agency's  main  contributions  to  safeguarding  and
    promoting the welfare of children include:

     . Ensuring good treatment and good interactions with children
       throughout the immigration and customs process.

     . Applying laws and policies that prevent the exploitation of children
       throughout and following facilitated illegal entry and trafficking.

     . Detecting at the border any material linked to child exploitation
       through pornography.

2.5.  Other parts of the UK Border Agency's contribution include:

     . Exercising vigilance when dealing with children with whom staff come
       into contact and identifying children who may be at risk of harm.

                  . Making timely and appropriate referrals
       to agencies that provide ongoing care and support to children.


MAKING ARRANGEMENTS TO SAFEGUARD  AND PROMOTE WELFARE IN THE UK BORDER
AGENCY

2.6.  The UK Border Agency acknowledges the status and importance of the
    following: the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
    and Fundamental Freedoms, the International Covenant on Civil and
    Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
    Cultural Rights,
    the EU Reception Conditions Directive, the
    Council of Europe Convention on Action



           Against Trafficking in Human Beings, and the UN Convention on
           the Rights of the Child. The UK Border Agency must fulfil
           the requirements of these instruments in relation to children
           whilst exercising its functions as expressed in UK domestic
           legislation and policies.

       2.7.  The UK Border Agency must also act according to the following
           principles:

            . Every child matters even if they are someone subject to
              immigration control.

            . In accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the
              Child the best interests of the child will be a primary
              consideration (although not necessarily the only
              consideration) when making decisions affecting children13.

            . Ethnic identity, language, religion, faith, gender and
              disability are taken into account when working with a child
              and their family.

            . Children should be consulted and the wishes and feelings of
              children taken into account wherever practicable when
              decisions affecting them are made, even though it will not
              always be possible to reach decisions with which the child
              will agree. In instances where parents and carers are present
              they will have primary
              responsibility for the children's concerns.

            . Children should have their applications dealt with in a
              timely way and that minimises the uncertainty that they may
              experience.

       2.8.  When speaking to a child or dealing with a case involving
           their welfare, staff must be sensitive to each child's needs.
           Staff must respond to them in a way that communicates respect,
           taking into account their needs, and their responsibilities to
           safeguard and promote their welfare.



       13  Cf. UNHCR Guidelines on Determining the Best Interests of the
         Child, pages 14 -15 section entitled "The Use of the Term
         'Best Interests' in the CRC" (CRC = Convention on the Rights of
         the Child).
SENIOR MANAGEMENT COMMITMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

2.9.  There shall be a senior member of staff (the "Children's Champion")
    who is responsible to the Chief Executive of the UK Border Agency for
    promoting the duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children
    throughout the UK Border Agency, for offering advice and support to UK
    Border
    Agency staff in issues related to children, and identifying and
    escalating areas of concern.

2.10. Senior managers throughout the UK Border Agency remain directly
    responsible for monitoring the actions of their staff
    to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. This includes ensuring
    that children are listened to appropriately and concerns expressed about
    their or any other child's welfare are taken seriously and responded
    to in an appropriate manner. In addition, an identified member of the
    senior civil service will have lead responsibility for promoting the
    duty within each business area.


CLEAR STATEMENTS OF RESPONSIBILITY, A CLEAR LINE OF ACCOUNTABILITY

2.11. Responsibility for the UK Border Agency's contribution to
    safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children lies with each member
    of staff according to their role. They are accountable to their line
    managers for this, with ultimate accountability for the Agency's
    contribution  lying with the Chief Executive. Within the UK Border
    Agency each function or unit led at senior civil service level must
    be proactive in ensuring that staff at all levels within that unit are
    aware of the duty and its relevance to their work. The approach might
    take the form of regularly finding time at team meetings to ensure that
    the requirements are known and understood or issuing specific
    instructions depending on the role and
    work of the unit. Managers should aim to encourage and enable a positive
    attitude to the needs of children among their staff as well as setting
    out clear formal instructions.

2.12. There must be clear arrangements whereby staff who become aware of
    instances where



           the duty is not being taken properly into account are able to
           report their concerns. These may be general concerns about the
           effectiveness of these arrangements; they may
           relate to the way in which a particular child was dealt with by
           the UK Border Agency; or, they may relate to the attitude and
           behaviour of
           staff towards children. Where staff members have any concern of
           this sort, they should first consider raising the matter with
           their line
           manager or with a line manager above that level (e.g. their
           countersigning officer). However, there may be occasions when
           because of the nature of their concerns, staff feel unable
           to report their concerns  in this way. In such cases, staff
           should express their concerns to the UK Border Agency's
           Children's Champion or other senior official with lead
           responsibility for children's issues. The Children's Champion
           should treat the matter as a confidential referral as far as
           possible.


       DEVELOPMENT OF THE AGENCY'S  POLICIES

       2.13. The duty will be taken into account when developing any new
           policies. Where appropriate new operational and policy
           instructions should make reference to the duty and how it is to
           be taken into account.


       TRAINING

       2.14. The UK Border Agency must ensure that members of staff are
           appropriately trained with regard to their duty to safeguard and
           promote the welfare of children.

       2.15. Training on safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children
           must be provided that is proportionate and relevant to the roles
           and responsibilities of staff members. All Agency staff should
           have a general understanding
           of children's issues, while those whose work brings them into
           contact with children, directly or indirectly, should have more
           in- depth training.


       SAFER RECRUITMENT, VETTING  AND COMPLAINTS PROCEDURES

       2.16. Recruitment and vetting procedures must ensure that new
           members of staff and
    those existing employees who move to posts with contact with children
    work safely and competently with children. The Safeguarding Vulnerable
    Groups Act 2006 will establish
    a new vetting and barring scheme for those who work with children and
    vulnerable adults which the UK Border Agency will implement.

2.17. The UK Border Agency complaints systems will be reviewed, and  adapted
    if necessary, to ensure that they are suitably accessible to children.


WORK WITH INDIVIDUAL  CHILDREN

2.18. This guidance cannot cover all the different situations in which the
    UK Border Agency comes in to contact with children. Staff need to be
    ready to use their judgement in how
    to apply the duty in particular situations and to refer to the detailed
    operational guidance which applies to their specific area of work. In
    general, staff should seek to be as responsive as they reasonably can be
    to the needs of
    the children with whom they deal, whilst still carrying out their core
    functions.

2.19. It may be helpful to set out here, by
    way of example, some of the key policy commitments which apply at
    different stages of the process:

     . Where there is doubt on arrival or subsequently about who is caring
       for the child staff must take action, for instance by seeking
       evidence that a particular
       named adult is caring for the child with the parent's consent.

     . Special care must be taken when dealing with unaccompanied asylum
       seeking children, for instance by checking with them that they
       understand the process for making and resolving their asylum claim,
       and ensuring that the physical settings in which their applications
       are dealt with are as child-friendly as possible to ensure that the
       child feels safe and protected.

     . When unaccompanied or separated children are being escorted from
       their normal place of residence to a port where removal will take
       place, they must be



              subject to detention procedures in the sense of being served
              with formal notice whilst the supervised escort is taking
              place. Other than in these situations,
              unaccompanied or separated children must be detained only in
              the most exceptional circumstances whilst other arrangements
              for their care and safety are made.

            . Families who have no right to be in this country must be
              encouraged to leave voluntarily and detention should be used
              only as a last resort and for the shortest possible time.

            . During any period of detention,
              reasonable steps should be taken to ensure that a child is
              able to continue his or her education, maintain contact with
              friends, and practise his or her religion.

            . Family detention arrangements must respect as fully as
              possible the principle that the primary responsibility for a
              child during this time still rests with the parents.

            . When children have to be transported from one venue to
              another, only suitable vehicles are used.

            . Nursing mothers and their children must not be separated at
              any stage unless
              there is a compelling reason that involves the safety of the
              child (for instance, an accompanying parent has threatened to
              harm the child). Other than in the most urgent circumstances
              involving the safety of the child, such a decision must be
              made and supervised by a qualified children's social worker.

       2.20. There should also be recognition that children cannot put on
           hold their growth or personal development until a potentially
           lengthy application process is resolved. Every effort must
           therefore be made to achieve timely decisions for them.

       2.21. In co-operation with the bodies qualified to plan for
           children's futures, including Local Authority Children's
           Services, schools, primary and specialist health services,
           arrangements
    must be put in place to secure the support needed by the individual
    child as they mature and develop into adulthood. Unless it is clear from
    the outset that a child's future is going to be in the UK, these
    arrangements will
    necessarily involve planning for the possibility that children and their
    families may have to
    be returned to their countries of origin (or in some cases the EU
    country in which they first claimed asylum).

2.22. The UK Border Agency must always make a referral to a statutory
    agency responsible for child protection or child welfare such as the
    police, the Health Service, or the Children's Department of a Local
    Authority14  in the following circumstances:

     . When a potential indicator of harm (the most comprehensive such list
       is found in Working Together to Safeguard Children who have been
       Trafficked15 and their application is wider than trafficking cases
       alone) has been identified.

     . When a child appears to have no adult to care for them and the Local
       Authority has not been notified.

     . When the child appears to be cared for by a person who is not a
       close relative (i.e. where a private fostering arrangement has been
       identified). The Children Act 1989 (Part IX, section 66) defines
       privately fostered children. All professionals and agencies that work
       with children must establish the relationship that exists between any
       child and those who care for him or her. If that relationship appears
       to be a private fostering relationship - or if the relationship
       cannot be established - a referral to the relevant Local Authority
       must be made.




14  All references to a Local Authority here in Par t 2 should be taken as
  a reference to Local Authority Children's Ser vices in England and Wales
  and Scotland. In Nor thern Ireland this will be the local Health and
  Social Care Trust.
15  Working Together to Safeguard Children who have been Trafficked issued
  by Home Office and DCSF, December 2007. The indicators are reproduced at
  Annex A. Separate guidance for Wales was issued by the Welsh Assembly
  Government in April 2008.



            . When a child is a potential victim of trafficking.

            . When a child is identified as having run away from their
              parents, or where they are looked after by a Local Authority
              and have gone missing from their care placement16.


       HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND TRAFFICKING OF CHILDREN

       2.23. Since 1 April 2009, the UK has been bound by the Council of
           Europe Convention on action against trafficking in human beings.
           The purpose of the Convention is to:

            . prevent and combat trafficking in human beings;

            . identify and protect victims of trafficking and to safeguard
              their rights;

            . promote international co-operation against trafficking.

       2.24. Although the UK Border Agency was already active in
           identifying and supporting victims
           of trafficking, the Convention has resulted in
           the introduction of even stronger arrangements. All UK Border
           Agency staff at operational and case working grades are required
           to complete training on how to identify potential victims of
           trafficking, which contains specific sections on the features of
           child trafficking. Where a child is identified as vulnerable as
           a result of a suspicion of trafficking, details of the case are
           referred simultaneously to the relevant Local Authority and to
           specially trained 'competent authority' teams based in the UK
           Border Agency and the UK Human Trafficking Centre.



       16  UKBA staf f must always make a referral to a Local Authority
         using the UKBA form available for this purpose at
         http://horizon/ind/ manuals/keeping-children-
         safe/resources/word/ReferralForm15. doc (Word), or
         http://horizon/ind/manuals/keeping-children-
         safe/resources/word/ReferralForm16.doc.(E-mail). Fur ther useful
         information can be found in "Statutor y Guidance on Children who
         run away and go missing from home or care" prepared to suppor t
         Local Authorities and issued under s. 7 of the Local Authority
         Social Ser vices Act 1970 by the DCSF in July 2009. It is
         available at www.dcsf.gov.uk/ever ychildmatters/_download/?id=6178
         Whilst the guidance is specific to England the challenge is common
         across all four countries of the United Kingdom and each is
         working to address the issues in ways that meet their own
         circumstances and needs.
2.25. These specially trained 'competent authority'
    teams were established under the Council of Europe Convention on Action
    against Trafficking in Human Beings and consider all relevant
    information, including any
    provided by local authority Children Services, in determining whether a
    case meets the thresholds for trafficking set out in the Convention. A
    positive decision will lead
    to a 45-day reflection period during which the victim will have access
    to support and will not be removed from the UK. This may be followed by
    the grant of an extendable residence permit. This is a significant
    safeguarding role for all UK Border Agency
    staff and a major contribution by the Agency to the wider safeguarding
    of children17.


WORKING WITHIN THE DEVOLVED ADMINISTRATIONS OF WALES, SCOTLAND  AND
NORTHERN IRELAND

2.26. Statutory children's services have been devolved to each of the
    devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
    Referrals to children's services must be made to the relevant public
    authority by the UK Border Agency when members of staff have identified
    children
    as being in need or at risk. Differences in legislation and local
    arrangements for making referrals must be respected and, where
    necessary, the relevant UK Border Agency regional directors will ensure
    that these differences are taken into account and suitable arrangements
    developed in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

2.27. For instance, in Scotland there is a Children's Charter that sets out
    what children and young people need and expect to help protect them from
    harm. It has been developed through talking to children and young people
    who
    have experienced the need to be protected and supported - but what it
    says applies to any child.

2.28. It is available at www.scotland.gov.uk/
    library5/education/ccel-00.asp and UK



17  The arrangements in over view are on the Home Office website at
  http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/operational-policing/ safeguarding-
  vulnerable-persons/child-trafficking/



           Border Agency staff working in Scotland should seek to be guided
           by and to follow it in their interactions with children.


       LOCAL SAFEGUARDING  CHILDREN BOARDS AND INTER-AGENCY WORKING

       2.29. In support of effective interagency working, the UK Border
           Agency should participate
           in LSCBs where appropriate and invited to do so, and should seek
           to contribute in accordance with Working Together to Safeguard
           Children (2006). The UK Border Agency is
           not a statutory member of LSCB nor is it a statutory partner
           under section 13 (section
           31 in Wales) of the 2004 Act. Instead the UK Border Agency will
           be invited to participate
           in those LSCBs where its presence is agreed to be necessary or
           desirable by Directors
           for Children and Learning in Regional Government Offices, or the
           Director of Children's Services with responsibility for the
           particular Board or by the UK Border
           Agency regional director. The work of LSCBs is co-ordinated by
           regional and national meetings and the UK Border Agency will
           make an appropriate contribution to these by agreement with the
           meeting organisers. The UK Border Agency should also take part
           in
           any appropriate inter-agency training arranged by LSCBs. In
           Scotland and Northern Ireland the UK Border Agency will co-
           operate with Child Protection Committees in the same way.

       2.30. The UK Border Agency will allow any LSCB in whose work it
           participates as an invited partner to include it in these
           monitoring
           and continuous improvement processes and must respond
           appropriately to concerns that are expressed as a result. The UK
           Border Agency is also subject to inspection from the independent
           Chief Inspector of the Border Agency which may include
           children's issues in its inspections, and from the Chief
           Inspector of Prisons who inspects all facilities in which
           children and young people may be detained.

       2.31. The UK Border Agency will assist other appropriate agencies
           who have contact with children and who are seeking to safeguard
           a child and promote his or her welfare.
INFORMATION  SHARING

2.32. The UK Border Agency should make best use of information exchanges
    between agencies including Contact Point and should ensure
    that other safeguarding agencies recognise, accept and respond to the
    referral forms that it sends to these and other bodies.

2.33. UK Border Agency staff should work with other statutory agencies,
    including but not limited to, LSCBs, children's services, the police and
    other relevant agencies. UK Border Agency staff should ensure that they
    share information appropriately with those agencies and with due regard
    to the provisions of the Data Protection and Human Rights Act 1998 and
    any duty of confidentiality which may exist. There should be clear
    responsibility within the agency for putting in place, and ensuring that
    all staff are aware of and
    follow procedures for ensuring that relevant information is passed to
    those other agencies where necessary.


CHILDREN AND UK BORDER AGENCY  STAFF OVERSEAS

2.34. The statutory duty in section 55 of the 2009
    Act does not apply in relation to children who are outside the United
    Kingdom. However, UK Border Agency staff working overseas must adhere to
    the spirit of the duty and make enquiries when they have reason to
    suspect
    that a child may be in need of protection or safeguarding, or presents
    welfare needs that require attention. In some instances international or
    local agreements are in place that permit or require children to be
    referred to the authorities of other countries and UK Border Agency
    staff will abide by these.

2.35. As a matter of policy, posts overseas that receive or deal with
    applications will seek to work with local agencies in order to develop
    arrangements that will protect children, or promote their welfare, or
    reduce the risk of their being trafficked and exploited.

2.36. Before taking up entry clearance or visa duties, UK Border Agency
    staff must receive




           training on the importance of having regard
           to the need safeguard and promote the welfare of children that
           they may encounter when working overseas.


       CONTRACTORS

       2.37. Any services provided by contractors which relate to the
           discharge of UK Border Agency functions must be carried out
           having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare
           of children. Operational instructions for contractors providing
           such services must refer explicitly to this. Examples of such
           services are detention and escorting functions. Although the
           duty does not extend to UK Border Agency staff and contractors
           overseas it is a matter of UK Border Agency policy
           that when they are escorting children overseas, they should have
           regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of
           children at every stage of the journey.

       2.38. Contractors must be adequately monitored to ensure that they
           have regard to the duty and the guidance.



       ANNEx A
       POSSIBLE INDICATORS THAT A CHILD MAY HAVE BEEN TRAFFICKED






       There a number of indicators which suggest that
       a child may have been trafficked into the UK, and may still be
       controlled by the traffickers or receiving adults. These are as
       follows:


       AT THE PORT OF ENTRY The child:
        . has entered the country illegally;

        . has no passport or other means of identification;

        . has false documentation;
The sponsor:

 . has previously made multiple visa applications for other children and/or

          expected to be seen in a child of such age;

        . does not appear to have money but does have a mobile phone;
          and/or

        . is known to beg for money;

        . performs excessive housework chores and rarely leaves the
          residence;

        . is malnourished;

        . is being cared for by adult/s who are not
          their parents and the quality of the relationship between the
          child and their adult carers is
          not good;

        . is one among a number of unrelated children found at one address;

        . has not been registered with or attended a
          GP practice;

        . has not been enrolled in school;

. Missing for long periods, with no known base;

. Placement breakdown;

. Pattern of street homelessness;
        . is permanently deprived of a large part of their earnings by
          another person; and/or
 . Possession of large amounts of money with no plausible explanation;

        . is excessively afraid of being deported.


       CHILDREN INTERNALLY  TRAFFICKED WITHIN THE UK

       Indicators  include:
 . Acquisition of expensive clothes, mobile phones or other possessions
 without plausible explanation;

. Having keys to premises other than those known about;

        . Physical symptoms (bruising indicating either physical or sexual
          assault);

        . Prevalence of a sexually transmitted infection or unwanted
          pregnancy;
 . Low self-image, low self-esteem, self-harming behaviour including
 cutting, overdosing, eating disorder, promiscuity;

. Truancy/disengagement with education;
        . Young person known to be sexually active;

        . Reports from reliable sources suggesting the likelihood of
          involvement in sexual exploitation;

        . Reports that the child has been seen in places known to be used
          for sexual exploitation;
 . Entering or leaving vehicles driven by unknown adults;

. Going missing and being found in areas where the  child  or  young  person
 has no known links; and/or




        . Possible inappropriate use of the internet
          and forming on-line relationships, particularly with adults.

       The indicators above should not be read as a definitive list and
       practitioners should be aware of any other unusual factors that may
       suggest a child might have been trafficked. They are intended
       as a guide, which should be included in a wider assessment of the
       young person's circumstances. The final set of indicators is
       applicable to both cases of sexual exploitation and internal
       trafficking.

       It is also important to note that trafficked children might not show
       obvious signs of distress or abuse and this makes identifying
       children who may have been trafficked difficult. Some children are
       unaware that
       they have been trafficked, while others may actively participate in
       hiding that they have been trafficked.
