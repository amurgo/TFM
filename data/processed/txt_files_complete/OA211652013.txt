                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on  3  March  1960.
    He appeals the determination of First-tier Judge Ross.  At that hearing
    as before us there was no appearance on behalf  of  the  appellant  and
    accordingly Judge Ross determined the matter  on  the  material  before
    him.  In the absence of any explanation it appears appropriate  for  us
    to proceed in the absence of the appellant or representative.

2.   The appellant had been issued with a multi-visit passport  valid  until
    15 February 2014 on 19 February 2009.  In support  of  the  application
    for the passport the appellant had submitted a letter from  Habib  Bank
    dated 2 December 2008 which stated that he was a  regular  employee  of
    the bank since joining it in 1980.  He was  working  as  the  assistant
    manager of a branch in Lahore.  On 20 July 2011 he  had  been  reissued
    with the visa valid as before until 15 February 2014.

3.   The appellant was refused entry to the UK on 7  November  2013  because
    he had left the employment of the bank on 31 May 2011 having opted  for
    premature retirement.  The refusal notice reads:

         "On 28 July 2011 you were issued with an entry clearance which  had
         effect as leave to enter the United Kingdom but I am satisfied that
         false representations were employed  or  material  facts  were  not
         disclosed for the purpose of obtaining the leave, or there has been
         such a change of circumstances in your case  since  the  leave  was
         granted that it  should  be  cancelled,  I  therefore  cancel  your
         continuing  leave.   If  your  leave  was  conferred  by  an  entry
         clearance, this will also have the effect of cancelling your  entry
         clearance.


         You were employed as an assistant bank manager at the time of  your
         visa application, however you state that  you  have  since  retired
         from this position, which represents a change of  circumstances  to
         your current employment.  Furthermore you have stated that you have
         paid for the Holiday Inn Express at Heathrow for five days, however
         the hotel confirms that this booking was cancelled by  your  travel
         agent and you hold the  limited  cash  funds  of  US$550  which  is
         approximately ï¿½341 at the current exchange rate.  These  funds  are
         to accommodate and maintain yourself for the period  of  five  days
         and also for three days in Istanbul.  You  have  stated  also  that
         your debit card has no funding  available  to  you  and  I  am  not
         satisfied that these funds are enough to accommodate  and  maintain
         yourself for the period stated."

4.   Accordingly directions were given for the appellant's removal.

5.   The judge records that the appellant argued that he had  not  made  any
    false representations at the time of obtaining the visa in 2009 because
    at that stage he was employed  by  the  bank.   The  judge  records  as
    follows in paragraph 4 of the determination:

         "I accept that no false representations were  made  in  this  case,
         however there was a change  of  circumstances  when  the  appellant
         retired on 31 May 2011, because he did  not  have  any  employment.
         The visa had been issued on the basis that the appellant had a  job
         with the bank, and now he did not have a job.  I consider therefore
         that the appellant has not acted in a way which is in any way to be
         criticised, but the fact remains that there had been  a  change  of
         circumstances."

6.   In paragraph 9 of the determination the judge reminds  himself  of  the
    applicable burden of proof:

         "The burden of proving that the appellant has either  been  subject
         to a change in his circumstances, or that he  has  submitted  false
         representations rests  on  the  respondent  to  a  high  degree  of
         probability.   In  relation  to  the  false   representations   the
         respondent must also prove that the false representations were made
         dishonestly."

7.   In  paragraph  10  of  the  determination  the  judge  found  that  the
    respondent had not proved that there were any false representations and
    the visa had been obtained on the basis that  the  appellant  had  been
    employed at  the  bank,  which  was  true.   Although  he  subsequently
    obtained a replacement visa on 20 July  2011  it  was  clear  that  the
    appellant's circumstances had changed on 31 May  2011.   He  had  taken
    early retirement.  When obtaining the  replacement  visa  for  the  one
    issued in 2009

         "it would seem that he did not disclose the fact  that  he  was  no
         longer employed, because the letter which has been  submitted  from
         the bank is dated 21 November 2013.  However, I consider that there
         is no  evidence  to  suggest  that  the  appellant,  who  has  been
         perfectly straightforward about his employment history,  failed  to
         disclose this information for dishonest reasons.  The position  was
         that he simply wanted a replacement visa for one  that  he  already
         had.  He should have disclosed at that stage  that  his  employment
         had ceased, but there is no evidence that he was  asked  about  it,
         and I am prepared to accept that he may not have known that he  was
         required to disclose this information.  In  any  event  I  consider
         that the Immigration Officer was entitled to refuse entry to the UK
         on the basis that the appellant's circumstances  had  changed,  and
         that this change in circumstances was a significant one and that he
         was right to cancel his leave.  The reason  for  this  is  that  in
         relation to visas which  give  permission  to  enter  the  UK,  the
         appellant's  circumstances  in  his  home  country  are   anxiously
         scrutinised with a view to deciding whether he has sufficient  ties
         to his home country, and that these are such that he will return at
         the end of his trip.  His finances are also examined in some detail
         because it is essential that he is able to afford to  maintain  and
         accommodate himself in the UK.  Although the hotel appears to  have
         made a mistake in his booking, this  does  not  alter  the  central
         problem which is that the appellant was no longer employed."

8.   The judge concluded the determination  by  dismissing  the  appeal  but
    adding this:

         "But I make it clear that I  have  made  no  findings  of  fact  in
         relation to  any  dishonest  behaviour  by  the  appellant,  and  I
         consider that this should be  taken  into  account  in  any  future
         applications for a visa."

9.   The appellant appealed the  decision  and  permission  was  refused  by
    First-tier Judge Nicholson on 18 July 2014.  Judge Nicholson noted that
    the grounds essentially reiterated the appellant's case.   He  observed
    that the fact that the appellant was unaware that the change might lead
    to cancellation of his visa did not alter the position and the decision
    of the judge had been open to him.  However, the judge  had  emphasised
    that he had made no findings of dishonesty and thus the appellant would
    not be precluded from making a further application for a  visa  in  the
    light of his change of circumstances.

10.  An application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  made
    and on 16 January  2015  permission  was  granted  although  the  Upper
    Tribunal Judge found great difficulty in understanding the points being
    made in the appellant's lengthy grounds.  Permission was granted on the
    point that save for the reference at paragraph 9 "there is  no  mention
    anywhere in the determination of the burden and standard of proof being
    applied."

11.  The respondent filed a  response  on  6  March  2015  noting  that  the
    grounds of application were wholly  incomprehensible  and  no  material
    error of law was identified  and  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had
    directed himself appropriately.

12.  Mr Nath submitted that no arguable error of  law  had  been  identified
    and he referred to the reasons given by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
    refusing permission to appeal.

13.  We reserved our decision.  In our respectful view the First-tier  Judge
    made it abundantly clear what standard of  proof  he  was  applying  in
    paragraph 9.  He was not satisfied that the respondent had  shown  that
    false representations had been made and there has been no  appeal  from
    that aspect of  the  decision  by  the  respondent.   While  the  judge
    accepted that  the  appellant  should  have  disclosed  the  change  of
    circumstances he did not  identify  any  dishonest  motivation  on  the
    appellant's part.  He had simply failed to bring  to  the  respondent's
    attention a change in his circumstances.  He had retired from the bank.
      The  judge  accepted  that   the   appellant   had   been   perfectly
    straightforward as we have indicated above.  The  judge  went  to  some
    length to make it clear to the respondent that he was  not  attributing
    any dishonesty to the appellant.

14.  We do not find that any  error  of  law  has  been  identified  in  the
    grounds  and  we  agree  with  the  respondent's  view  that  they  are
    incomprehensible.  We see  no  evidence  of  any  misdirection  in  the
    judge's approach to the issues before him.

15.  For these reasons and for the  reasons  given  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Nicholson when refusing the application for permission to appeal,
    this application is refused and we direct  that  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Judge shall stand.
     Appeal dismissed
