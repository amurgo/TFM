Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr Cyprian Amgbah, a legal representative with UK

For the respondent:    Mr Esen Tufan, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal on 20 June 2018 to refuse him  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom on human rights  grounds  and  to  refuse  to  revoke  a
    deportation order made on 23 November 2017.  The appellant is a citizen
    of Jamaica.



Background

 2. When in Jamaica, the appellant lived with  his  maternal  grandparents.
    He arrived in the United Kingdom on 7 September 2001, at nearly 6 years
    old, travelling  on  a  visit  visa  with  his  mother.   Following  an
    application by his mother for leave to remain  in  July  2002,  he  was
    granted leave to remain, and then on 24 February 2004, when  he  was  8
    years old, he was granted indefinite leave to remain in line  with  his
    mother, who had married a British citizen.  While  he  was  still  very
    young, under 5 years old, the appellant underwent surgery (probably  in
    Jamaica) for a cerebral abscess, which left him blind in  one  eye  and
    with limited sight in the other eye.  The condition was identified  and
    diagnosed by a CT scan while the  appellant  was  in  Jamaica.   He  is
    registered as partially sighted and later developed seizures.

 3. The appellant visited Jamaica three times between the ages of 5 and 15,
    travelling with his mother and staying with his maternal  grandparents.
    His last visit was in 2010, when his aunt and cousin also  came  along.



 4. The appellant's grandfather has now died, and  his  grandmother  is  76
    years old and in poor  health.   A  letter  from  her  general  medical
    practitioner in St Ann's Bay, Jamaica, says that  the  grandmother  has
    high blood pressure  (arterial  hypertension  with  hypertensive  heart
    disease); osteoarthritis of the right knee; peripheral vascular disease
    and neuropathic pain.  A  computerised  tomography  (CT)  scan  of  his
    grandmother's brain  in  April  2013  showed  cerebral  and  cerebellar
    atrophy, chronic small vessel  disease,  and  early  or  mild  vascular
    calcification.   The report concluded that:

         "As a result of [the grandmother's] chronic illnesses mentioned,  I
         can say that she is incapable of performing everyday tasks, plus we
         have to keep in consideration that her age  will  be  a  triggering
         factor for the progression of her chronic illnesses."

    There is no medical evidence that the appellant's  grandmother's  brain
    problems have increased since April 2013 and  the  other  ailments  are
    mild and appear typical of those which afflict many older  people.  She
    has a carer who looks after her but there is nothing from the carer  to
    say what support is required.

 5. On 20 March 2012, a transition learning difficulty (TLD) assessment was
    carried out.  The report noted that the appellant's school leaving date
    was 22 June 2012 and that he could not work full time before that date.
     The appellant was living at home  with  his  mother,  step-father  and
    sister; he played football and trained at Tooting and Mitcham  Football
    Club.  He enjoyed the  company  of  friends,  watching  television  and
    playing on his PlayStation 3.  He had been supplied  with  an  enlarger
    mouse and large font books at school, and had access to  a  scribe  but
    rarely  needed  it.  The  report  described  him  as  an   'independent
    traveller' who had his own Oyster card.

 6. The appellant in his TLD assessment said that he wanted to progress  to
    a  sports  course  in  college,  or  as  a  back-up,  a  motor  vehicle
    engineering course.  He saw his future as 'doing something in football'
    but had made no applications to any further education colleges.  He had
    not worked yet, but had helped his elder brother with package delivery.

 7. The appellant had some employment history in  the  United  Kingdom:  in
    2013/2014 he worked with children as a sports coach.  From February  to
    June 2014, he took a course leading to a BTec sports qualification.  In
    2016 he worked for three months in a bakery.  He had also worked  in  a
    warehouse, as an agency employee, for a short period.  The  appellant's
    ambition was to work as a football coach or agent.

 8. The appellant was entitled to disability living allowance  until  2016.
    In 2017, he was invited to interview by ATOS Healthcare to see  whether
    he qualified for a Personal Independence Payment.  It is  unclear  what
    was the outcome of that application but it may have overlapped with his
    offending in that year.

 9. The appellant takes epilepsy medication, without which he has seizures.
    He had regular seizures until 2016, then a two-year gap before his most
    recent seizure in 2018, which may have been  caused  by  non-compliance
    with his epilepsy medication.

10. The appellant continues to live at home with  his  mother,  who  cooks,
    washes, and does his laundry for him.  His sister lives there too;  the
    refusal letter states that  the  appellant's  brother,  who  is  now  a
    naturalised British citizen, is no longer living with  his  mother  and
    sister but has his own home.  The  respondent's  mother  takes  him  to
    appointments and reminds him of them.  His mother's evidence  was  that
    although the appellant could  sometimes  go  to  places  unaccompanied,
    because of his sight difficulties, he usually needed her  to  accompany
    him.  The respondent did not accept that there was  dependency  between
    the appellant and his mother, or his sister, amounting to  family  life
    between them as adults.

11. The appellant has a new British citizen  girlfriend  who  is  expecting
    their child in April 2019.  The relationship began just a year ago,  in
    April 2018.  The couple do not live together but  the  appellant  stays
    over at her house, or she stays at his home, and they  spend  three  or
    four nights a week together.

12. The appellant's girlfriend works full time and she considered that  she
    would need to rely on him to help care for the child when it  was  born
    in April 2019.  Neither of them suggested that the appellant's  limited
    vision would make this difficult.

Offending history

13. Before his 18th birthday in November 2013, the appellant was  convicted
    of three offences: on 14 August 2012, assaulting a  constable  (he  was
    fined �75 and given unconditional bail); on 18 December 2012,  handling
    stolen goods (unconditional bail and a Youth Rehabilitation Order); and
    on 4 April 2013, using disorderly behaviour or threatening, abusive  or
    insulting words likely to cause alarm or distress (he was fined �50).

14. The appellant's adult offences begin with a conviction two years later,
    on 9 November 2015, when he  was  just  under  20  years  old:  he  was
    convicted of assault occasioning  actual  bodily  harm,  for  which  he
    received a 12-month community order, a supervision requirement, and was
    required to undertake a programme for 21 days.

15. Unfortunately, before the 12 months expired the appellant was convicted
    again, on 4 October 2016, for possession of a Class B  controlled  drug
    (cannabis/cannabis resin), for which he received a community  order,  a
    30-day rehabilitation requirement, a 19-day programme requirement,  and
    was placed on an electronic tagging curfew for three months.  This  was
    varied in September  2017  due  to  the  commission  of  an  additional
    offence, the theft of a motor vehicle.  The rehabilitation  requirement
    was varied to 30 days, with a 19-day thinking skills programme.

16. In the meantime on 10 July 2017, the appellant was again  convicted  of
    possession of cannabis/cannabis resin and  received  another  community
    order with electronically tagged curfew.  On  26  September  2017,  the
    appellant was convicted not only of the motor vehicle offence but  also
    of failure to comply with  the  requirements  of  the  4  October  2016
    conviction.

17. On 26 October 2017, when the appellant was nearly 22 years old, he  was
    convicted of battery of his then partner, carried out in  the  presence
    of her 4-year old child, and of assaulting a constable.  The  appellant
    received a custodial sentence of 4� months and was made the subject  of
    an indefinite restraining order, protecting  his  former  partner  from
    harassment.   The appellant pleaded not guilty and  continues  to  deny
    responsibility for this offence, blaming his former  partner  for  what
    occurred.

18. On 19 October 2018 the appellant was again arrested for possession of a
    Class B controlled drug but no further action was taken.  He was served
    with a deportation order and detained.   The  appellant  made  a  human
    rights appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

First-tier Tribunal decision

19. At the beginning of the First-tier Tribunal hearing, the  Tribunal  was
    provided with notification of breach of immigration bail conditions and
    a printout of his Police National Computer record.

20. The First-tier Tribunal heard oral evidence from  the  appellant,  from
    his mother, brother, sister, and his current girlfriend.   He  produced
    evidence concerning the death of  his  grandfather  in  Jamaica  and  a
    doctor's letter evidencing the poor health of his grandmother there.

21. The respondent accepted that the appellant had been  lawfully  resident
    in the United Kingdom for  most  of  his  life  and  was  socially  and
    culturally  integrated  here,  but  considered  that  there   were   no
    significant obstacles to his reintegration to Jamaica if he were to  be
    deported there.

22. The appellant had made no enquiries as to employment  or  accommodation
    in Jamaica; the First-tier Judge found that he  was  still  in  contact
    with his  grandmother  and  could  live  with  her  and  continue  with
    medication to control his seizures.  The appellant had received medical
    care while a child in Jamaica, before he came to  the  United  Kingdom,
    and there was also a letter from his grandmother's doctor; no  evidence
    had been produced indicating that the appellant's  sight  problems  and
    epilepsy could not be managed in Jamaica.

23. The appellant and his girlfriend did not have a child yet at  the  date
    of hearing  and  the  First-tier  Judge  considered  that  despite  the
    difficulties which the girlfriend would have in coping with the  coming
    child alone, and in the appellant creating a relationship with his  new
    child, once it was born, the appellant was already  the  subject  of  a
    deportation order when the relationship began and  was,  therefore,  in
    the United Kingdom precariously.

24. The First-tier Judge applied KO (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department [2018] UKSC 53 and held that the effect of  deportation
    would not be unduly harsh for the appellant's  girlfriend.   The  child
    had not yet been born and therefore was not a  relevant  consideration.
    The Judge did not accept that the appellant required any more care than
    others who did not have a vision problem and found that  there  was  no
    family life between the appellant and his mother or  his  brothers  and
    sisters.

25. The  appeal  was  dismissed.   The  appellant  appealed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

26. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kamara on  the
    basis that it was arguable that the First-tier Judge did  not  consider
    paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended)  nor  assess
    whether there were exceptional circumstances which might  outweigh  the
    public interest in deportation.

Rule 24 Reply

27. The respondent in a Rule 24 Reply set out the  relevant  paragraphs  in
    the First-tier Judge's decision, noting that the burden of proof was on
    the  appellant  to  show  that  deportation  was   not   proportionate.
    Paragraph 398(c) of the Rules applied as the appellant was a persistent
    offender.

28. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Upper Tribunal hearing

29. The respondent does not  dispute  that  the  relationship  between  the
    appellant and his current partner is genuine, albeit too short for  her
    to be a GEN.1 partner under the Rules.   The  respondent  accepts  that
    the appellant has spent most of his life in the United Kingdom  and  is
    integrated here.

30. For the appellant, Mr Amgbah said that the issue for the  Tribunal  was
    whether under paragraph 399A and  section  117C(3)  with  reference  to
    Exception 1 at section 117C(4).  In each case, as lawful residence  for
    most of the appellant's life and social and cultural  integration  were
    not in issue, the sole question for the Upper Tribunal was whether  the
    First-tier Judge had been entitled to find that there would not be very
    significant  obstacles  to  the  appellant's  integration  in   Jamaica
    (paragraph 399A(c) and section 117C(4)(c)).

31. Mr Amgbah relied on his grounds of appeal and did not wish  to  add  to
    them, save to  confirm  that  he  accepted  that  the  appellant  is  a
    persistent offender.

32. Mr Tufan also relied on his Rule 24 Reply, emphasising the  appellant's
    offending history.

33. I reserved my decision, which I now give.

Analysis

34. The question whether there are significant obstacles  to  reintegration
    is one  of  fact  for  the  First-tier  Tribunal  as  the  fact-finding
    Tribunal.  The appellant's grounds of appeal challenge the  finding  of
    fact that the appellant is able  to  care  for  himself,  although  his
    mother does a lot for him (as many mothers do  when  their  sons  still
    live at home).  The appellant's grounds suggest that it was not open to
    the Judge to find that the appellant had not demonstrated that he could
    not live with his grandmother, at least initially, because she was  old
    and had a carer; and he contended that  insufficient  weight  had  been
    given to the medical evidence and in  particular  reports  of  seizures
    while in detention last year.

35. The appellant sought to distinguish the learning difficulty  assessment
    in 2012 in the  light  of  alleged  deterioration  in  the  appellant's
    condition as he matured from the age of 17 to the age  he  was  at  the
    date of the First-tier Tribunal decision (23 years old).  There  is  no
    satisfactory evidence in the materials before me to  support  that.   I
    note from the detention records that  the  appellant  is  described  as
    having used a stick in the past for his blindness, suggesting  that  he
    did not need it now, and that he has played and trained in football for
    a local club (which requires some level of vision).

36. The appellant also challenged the finding by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    that there was no family life between the appellant,  his  mother,  and
    his brother and sister, because of his increased dependency.  The Judge
    gave adequate and sustainable reasons for his findings and the  grounds
    of appeal do not demonstrate an error of fact at the level of an  error
    of law (see [90] in the judgment of Lord Justice Brooke in R  (Iran)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982).

37. Contrary to the  appellant's  submissions,  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision is properly, intelligibly and adequately reasoned. The medical
    evidence relied upon, both as to himself and his grandmother, does  not
    amount  to  exceptional  circumstances  nor  is  there  evidence   that
    treatment does not exist in Jamaica for his condition.   In  fact,  the
    contrary appears to be the case, as he was  treated  for  his  epilepsy
    when a very young child in Jamaica.

38. It was unarguably open to the First-tier Judge to find that there  were
    no significant obstacles to the appellant integrating in Jamaica if  he
    were to be deported there.

DECISION

39. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error  on
    a point of law

    I do not set aside the decision but order that it shall stand.
