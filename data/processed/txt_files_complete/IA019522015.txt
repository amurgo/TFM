                                   Between

                          Jefter Ferdlindo Legister
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Having read  the  grounds  supporting  the  application  for  permission  to
appeal, the grant of permission to appeal and, most importantly, the  letter
from Mr J Parkinson, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer, sent  by  e-mail
on 5 January 2017, stating that the respondent does not  oppose  the  appeal
and does not seek an oral hearing, I am satisfied that  the  appeal  can  be
dealt with justly without a hearing.

It is plain that the Appellant had withdrawn his appeal  before  the  First-
tier Tribunal purported to decided it. The decision to withdraw  the  appeal
did not come to  the  attention  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  who,
erroneously,  purported  to  determine  an  appeal  that  had  already  been
withdrawn.

It follows that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  law.  I  set  aside  the
decision of the First-tier Tribunal  and  substitute  a  decision  that  the
appeal to the First-tier Tribunal had been abandoned.

To the extent indicated above, the appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

|Judge of the Upper Tribunal          |Dated 5 January 2017                 |
