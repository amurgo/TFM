For the Appellant:     Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr P Richardson, counsel, instructed by Nasim & Co
Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. I shall refer to the appellant as "the secretary of state" and to  the
      respondent as "the claimant".


   2. The secretary of state appeals with permission against the decision of
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge who, in a  decision  promulgated  on  27
      July 2015, allowed the claimant's appeal on human rights grounds.


   3. The claimant is a national of Pakistan, born on 6  February  1991.  He
      appealed against the decision of  the  secretary  of  state  dated  14
      November 2014 refusing to vary his  leave  to  remain  in  the  UK  on
      account of his family life [1].


   4. There was no presenting officer at the hearing before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge. At his appeal hearing the claimant claimed to  be  the
      main carer for his aunt. If he had to leave the UK  it  would  have  a
      serious and detrimental effect upon her physical  and  mental  health.
      Medical evidence was produced in support.


   5. Three letters were produced in respect of  Ms  Taslim  T  Akhtar  (DOB
      26.12.47) from Dr Qaiyum, dated 12 November 2013, 20 August  2014  and
      18 May 2015 respectively. The doctor confirmed that she is  registered
      with their practice. She suffers  from  hypertension,  hyperlipidemia,
      peripheral  vascular  disease  and  anxiety.  She  had  a   myocardial
      infarction in about November 2010  and  has  difficulty  walking.  She
      cannot go out of the house alone to do shopping.


   6. It is asserted that she has become incapable of looking after  herself
      as a result of her poor health. She requires to be looked  after;  she
      has had the claimant with her for over two years. He has looked  after
      her; he is "the sole carer". She is totally dependent on him  for  all
      household as well as outside work. She also relies on him  for  visits
      to the surgery. That is repeated in the letters dated 20  August  2014
      and in the letter dated 18 May 2015, where it is stated that  she  has
      been fortunate to have her nephew, the claimant, living with  her  for
      almost five years now.


   7. The claimant also asserted that his aunt has no family nearby to  look
      after her and prefers the personal care he provides "... and does  not
      believe that this can be obtained through Social Services." [4]


   8. The claimant married his wife, Ms Munida Naeem, in the UK on 5 October
      2012 and has been living with her for over two and a  half  years.  Ms
      Naeem is a qualified pharmacist and works as a locum  earning  �14,000
      gross per annum as well as running her own consultancy from which  she
      earns a further �21,000 gross per  annum.  Her  payslips  as  well  as
      information  from  her  accountant  were  produced  in  support.   The
      claimant is not working and he and his wife live with his aunt [5].


   9. In a letter dated 15 May 2015, the accountants for Elegant  Eyes  Corp
      (EEC) Ltd "confirmed" that the company has been trading "for the  past
      year". The business started in 2013. Ms  Naeem  is  the  director  and
      "will receive a salary of �21,000 per annum from this company."


  10. There is a letter  from  the  same  accountants  with  regard  to  the
      company, dated 28 August 2014,  stating  that  the  company  has  been
      trading for the past year. The business started in August 2013 and the
      accounts have only become due after August 2014. It is  asserted  that
      Ms Naeem is the director and will receive  a  salary  of  �21,000  per
      annum from this company.


  11. The payslips from Elegant Eyes  Corporation  (EEC)  Ltd,  produced  at
      pages 12-12E, cover the period January 2015 to  May  2015.  There  are
      also payslips produced from pages 102-110 from Burns Chemist  Ltd  for
      the period November 2013-July 2014. As at 28 February 2014, the  total
      gross pay to date was �12884.93. As at 31 July 2014, the  total  gross
      pay was �6148.68.


  12. The claimant and Ms Naeem contended that it would be difficult if they
      were separated. Ms  Naeem  would  find  it  difficult  to  work  as  a
      pharmacist in Pakistan. Her qualifications are  not  transferable.  It
      would be difficult for a woman pharmacist to establish  herself  given
      that medical advice would have to be given to male and female patients
      [6].


  13. Moreover, the timescale was uncertain. There was no way of knowing how
      long it would take for the claimant to apply out of  country,  and  it
      could lead to their being separated for many months, if not more  than
      a year. [7] Ms Naeem did not believe that mentally she would cope well
      with the separation. That would have an effect on  her  working  life.
      She might have to reduce her hours as she would have to  undertake  to
      look after Ms Akhtar in his absence [7].


  14. The claimant asserted that he had been here lawfully and has  had  his
      leave to remain legitimately extended. They are settled as  a  couple.
      The genuine nature of the relationship has not been  disputed.  It  is
      also asserted that they have satisfied the financial requirements  for
      settlement as a partner [8].


  15. The claimant "makes his argument" under Article 8 of the Human  Rights
      Convention, namely that the secretary of state's decision  constitutes
      a disproportionate interference with his family life, his  wife's  and
      his aunt's [9].


  16. The Judge noted the secretary of state's case. She made  her  decision
      pursuant to paragraph 276ADE and Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.
      There were no insurmountable obstacles for them continuing family life
      in  Pakistan.  Nor  were  there  exceptional   circumstances   present
      warranting consideration outside the rules [10].


  17. The claimant's aunt  did  not  attend  the  hearing  and  her  witness
      statement was  tendered.  The  Judge  found  that  its  contents  were
      credible and consistent with  her  account  given  in  the  claimant's
      unsuccessful EEA appeal on 5 September 2014.  On  that  occasion,  the
      claimant's appeal under Appendix FM was remitted to the respondent for
      further consideration, culminating in a further refusal by her and the
      current appeal before the First-tier Tribunal Judge [16].


  18. The Judge noted that there was  no  claim  made  by  the  claimant  in
      respect of family life under paragraph 276ADE and Appendix FM  of  the
      rules. He noted that the secretary of state did not  consider  in  her
      refusal decision the claimant's position under Article 8 of the  Human
      Rights Convention. The claimant asked the Judge to consider his appeal
      under Article 8 of the EHCR. He asked the Court to consider his appeal
      under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention "in respect  to  family
      life because he says that the facts of his case are such that they are
      exceptional or compassionate circumstances present" [17].


  19. The secretary of state stated in the final paragraph of page 4 of  the
      reasons for refusal that it  has  also  been  considered  whether  the
      particular  circumstances  set  out  in  the  application   constitute
      exceptional circumstances which, consistent with the right to  respect
      for private and family life contained in Article 8 of the ECHR,  might
      warrant consideration by the secretary of state of a grant of leave to
      remain in the UK outside the requirements of the Immigration Rules. In
      the penultimate paragraph the secretary of state sets out the  matters
      that have been considered  in  this  respect,  including  the  medical
      condition of the claimant's aunt. It was not accepted that  there  are
      exceptional  circumstances  "...   which   would   mean   removal   is
      inappropriate in your case".


  20.  At  [18]  the  Judge  stated  that  in  the  light  of  the   current
      jurisprudence, after applying  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
      Rules, only if there may be arguably good grounds for  granting  leave
      to remain  to  the  claimant  outside  the  Immigration  Rules  is  it
      necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to  consider  whether  there
      are  exceptional  or  compassionate  circumstances  not   sufficiently
      recognised under them.


  21. The Judge considered, from the facts  present,  that  there  are  such
      exceptional or compassionate circumstances "which could arguably" lead
      to a grant of leave to remain: the claimant and  Ms  Naeem  are  in  a
      genuine and subsisting relationship and  they  otherwise  satisfy  the
      requirements for settlement. He stated that he therefore does go on to
      consider the claimant's position under Article 8 of the  Human  Rights
      Convention outside of the Immigration Rules [18].


  22. He assessed the  claim  as  at  the  date  of  hearing  following  the
      'principles in Razgar v SSHD (2004) UKHL 27.  There  was  family  life
      present here for the claimant and Ms Naeem. The issue was whether such
      interference is proportionate [19].


  23. He found that the claimant and Ms Naeem have been  in  a  genuine  and
      subsisting relationship for over two and a half years. Ms Naeem  earns
      about �35,000 per annum and she supports the  claimant.  It  would  be
      difficult for her to continue her work as a pharmacist in Pakistan and
      for her to have to go there would mean disrupting both her career  and
      business. There  was  no  way  of  knowing  how  long  any  settlement
      application from Pakistan might take [20].


  24. They live in a  property  owned  by  the  claimant's  aunt.  There  is
      adequacy of accommodation. No adverse  comments  were  raised  by  the
      secretary of state regarding their financial details [21].


  25. He therefore found "in the round"  that  to  expect  the  claimant  to
      return to Pakistan  to  make  a  settlement  application  would  be  a
      disproportionate interference with his and  his  wife's  family  life.
      There was simply no good reason for that course of  action.  They  are
      straightforward and decent young people  in  a  genuine  relationship.
      They are adequately accommodated and their financial situation  is  in
      excess of the financial threshold required of them. To expect them  to
      suffer the anxiety and disruption  of  separation  for  an  "undefined
      period"  when  "to  all  intents  and  purposes  such   a   settlement
      application from Pakistan would succeed was not a proportionate way to
      deal with their family life [22].


  26. The claimant has not claimed state benefits; he  speaks  English  very
      well and has obtained qualifications  here.  There  is  no  reason  to
      believe that he would  not  find  work  and  thereby  earn  money  and
      continue not being a burden on taxpayers, and there is unlikely to  be
      any issue with his integration [23].


  27. He stated at [24] that as his appeal succeeds at this stage, it is not
      necessary for him to go on to consider his position under Article 8 in
      relation to his aunt [24].


     The grant of permission to appeal: Submissions


  28. On 27 January 2016,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Andrew  granted  the
      secretary of state permission to appeal. There was an  arguable  error
      that in coming to his decision, the Judge did not consider whether  it
      would be disproportionate for the claimant to return  to  Pakistan  to
      apply for entry clearance and he did not consider whether family  life
      could be continued abroad.


  29. Mr Duffy relied on the grounds of  appeal,  including  the  contention
      that the Judge had not in substance had adequate regard  to  s.117  of
      the 2002 Act, as amended. He relied in that respect on  the  decisions
      in Dube (ss. 117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 90 as  clarified  in  AM  (s.117B)
      Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260.


  30. It was accepted that the claimant  could  not  meet  the  requirements
      under the Rules. He therefore requested  his  case  to  be  determined
      under "free standing Article 8 assessment" on the basis of his  family
      life.


  31.  The  conclusion  by  the  Judge  that  there  were   exceptional   or
      compassionate circumstances because the claimant and his wife are in a
      genuine and subsisting relationship was not a sufficient reason to  go
      outside the requirements of the Rules. Mr Duffy relied on the decision
      of the Court of Appeal in Singh v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ  74  where  the
      Court at [61] referred to the decision of Sales J in R (Nagre) v  SSHD
      [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin). Sales J  rejected  the  contention  that  the
      effect of the  changes  introduced  by  HC  194  was  to  exclude  the
      possibility of claims which relied on article 8 "outside the Rules".


  32. Whilst the secretary of state was not inhibited from considering  such
      claims, Sales J stated at [29] of Nagre,  that  nonetheless,  the  new
      rules do provide better explicit coverage of the factors identified in
      case law as relevant to analysis of claims under Article  8  than  was
      formerly  the  position,  so  in  many  cases  the  main  points   for
      consideration in relation to Article  8  would  be  addressed  by  the
      decision makers applying the new rules. It is  only  if,  after  doing
      that, there remains an arguable case that there may  be  good  grounds
      for granting leave to remain outside the rules by reference to Article
      8, that it will be necessary for  Article  8  purposes  to  go  on  to
      consider whether there are compelling circumstances  not  sufficiently
      recognised under the new rules to require the grant of such leave.


  33. Having considered a passage from Izuazu (Article 8 - new Rules) [2013]
      UKUT 45 IAC), Sales J added at [30]  a  slight  modification  for  the
      purposes of clarity. If, after the process of applying the  new  rules
      and finding that the claim for leave to remain under them  fails,  the
      relevant official or  Tribunal  Judge  considers  it  clear  that  the
      consideration under the rules has fully addressed any family  life  or
      private life issues arising under Article 8, it  would  be  sufficient
      simply to say that; they would not  have  to  go  on  in  addition  to
      consider the case separately from the rules. If there is  no  arguable
      case that there may be good  grounds  for  granting  leave  to  remain
      outside the rules by reference to Article 8, there would be  no  point
      in introducing full separate consideration of Article  8  again  after
      having reached a decision on the application of the rules.


  34. Mr Duffy submitted that this approach was upheld in  both  SS  (Congo)
      and Others v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 387 and Agyarko v SSHD  [2015]  EWCA
      Civ 440.


  35. He submitted that the reason given by the Judge did not  constitute  a
      proper basis for going outside  the  requirements  of  the  rules.  He
      relied on [50] and [51] of SS (Congo).


  36. He further submitted that the Judge erred in concluding that it  would
      be disproportionate for the claimant to seek entry clearance. No valid
      or adequate reasons for that finding had been given. He relied on [31]
      of Agyarko, supra. He referred to Chen R (on  the  application  of)  v
      SSHD   (Appendix   FM   -   Chikwamba   -   temporary   separation   -
      proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 189. The claimant had accordingly not
      shown that exceptional circumstances exist  and  had  not  provided  a
      proper  basis  for  finding  that  temporary   separation   would   be
      disproportionate. Nor did the Judge properly consider  whether  family
      life can continue abroad.


  37. Mr Duffy accordingly submitted that the decision should be  set  aside
      and re-made on the current papers by the Upper  Tribunal.  A  decision
      should be made substituting that of the First-tier  Tribunal  and  the
      claimant's appeal should be dismissed.


  38. On behalf of the  claimant,  Mr  Richardson  relied  on  his  Rule  24
      response. He submitted that  the  secretary  of  state  had  not  been
      granted permission on that ground. In any event  with  regard  to  the
      contention that the Judge did not adequately  consider  s.117  of  the
      2002 Act, he submitted that following Dube (ss 117A -D) [2015] UKUT 90
      (IAC), it is not an error of law to fail to refer  to  the  s.117  A-B
      considerations if the Judge has applied the test he  was  supposed  to
      apply according to its terms; what matters is substance, not form. The
      Judge  did  apply  the  principles  established  by  this  section  in
      substance as set out at [23].


  39. He referred to the fact that the Judge found at [15] that the claimant
      and his wife were credible witnesses. He provided 'the gateway' to his
      conclusions. The secretary of  state  seeks  to  disagree  with  those
      findings. The Judge accepted that his aunt had  no  family  nearby  to
      look after her and that she would prefer  the  personal  care  of  the
      appellant and did not believe that  this  could  be  obtained  through
      Social Services. Mr Richardson submitted that there  could  be  social
      services provision, but a relative's care is important  and  that  was
      accepted by the Judge. This was  based  on  the  evidence  of  the  GP
      letters that were produced (to which I have referred).


  40. Mr Richardson accepted that even though the  claimant  had  been  here
      lawfully, the element of precariousness was  nevertheless  a  relevant
      matter applicable in the s.117 considerations.


  41. The  finding  by  the  Judge  that  it  would  be  a  disproportionate
      interference with the claimant's and his wife's family life to  expect
      him to return  to  Pakistan  to  make  a  settlement  application  was
      consistent with Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40.


  42. In the alternative, he submitted  that  the  hardship  that  would  be
      caused to the claimant, his wife and aunt by  a  temporary  separation
      fell within the category of cases  envisaged  in  Agyarko,  supra  and
      Chen, supra, where the Chikwamba principle continues to prevail.


  43. He  referred  to  Agyarko  at  [24].  The  "insurmountable  obstacles"
      criterion is used by the Rules to define one of the preconditions  set
      out in section EX.1 (b) which need to be satisfied before an applicant
      can claim to be entitled to be  granted  leave  to  remain  under  the
      Rules. In that context it is not simply a  factor  to  be  taken  into
      account.


  44. However, in the context of making a wider Article 8 assessment outside
      the Rules, it is a factor to be taken into account,  not  an  absolute
      requirement which has to be satisfied in every single case across  the
      wide range of cases covered by Article 8. At [30] Sales LJ stated that
      it is thus possible that a case might be found to be  exceptional  for
      the purposes of the relevant test  under  Article  8  in  relation  to
      precarious  family  life  even  where  there  are  no   insurmountable
      obstacles to continuing family life overseas. This does not mean  that
      the issue whether there are or are  not  insurmountable  obstacles  to
      relocation drops out of the picture where there is reliance on Article
      8.  It is a material factor to be taken into account.  The gap between
      section EX.1 and the requirements of article 8 is likely to be small.


  45. At [31] Lord Justice Sales stated that it is possible  to  envisage  a
      Chikwamba type arising in which Article 8 might require that leave  to
      remain be granted outside the rules, even though it could not be  said
      that there were insurmountable obstacles to the  applicant  and  their
      spouse or partner continuing their family life  overseas.  In  a  case
      involving precarious family life, it would be necessary  to  establish
      that  there  were  exceptional  circumstances  to   warrant   such   a
      conclusion.


  46. Mr Richardson submitted that  the  findings  by  the  Judge  regarding
      income were sufficient and unchallenged.  There  was  evidence  before
      him. The sponsor was self employed and had income from employment. The
      Judge had to look at the  situation  before  him  which  includes  the
      evidence set out in the bundle. It is far fetched to suggest that this
      might not be the position in any future application from abroad.


  47. Mr Richardson did not make any submissions regarding the  disposal  of
      this matter in the event that the decision were to be  set  aside.  He
      did not argue against Mr Duffy's submission that the  Tribunal  should
      re-make the decision.


  48. In reply, Mr Duffy submitted that the Judge did not provide  a  proper
      basis for finding that the claimant's application from Pakistan  would
      succeed. The relevant evidential requirements under Appendix FM-SE had
      not been shown to  have  been  met.  It  cannot  be  argued  from  the
      determination that the claimant would succeed in such  an  application
      from Pakistan.


     Assessment


  49. The Judge noted at [17] that there was no claim made by  the  claimant
      in respect of family  life  under  the  Rules  (paragraph  276ADE  and
      Appendix FM). The claimant based his argument  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal under Article 8, contending that the decision  constituted  a
      disproportionate interference with his family life, that of  his  wife
      and his aunt [9].


  50. The Judge summarised the secretary of state's case  at[10].   She  did
      not  'believe'  that  any  exceptional  circumstances   were   present
      warranting consideration outside the rules. The Judge stated  at  [17]
      that the secretary of state did not consider the applicant's  position
      under Article 8 and  the  claimant  accordingly  asked  the  Judge  to
      consider the appeal under Article 8  on  the  basis  that  there  were
      exceptional or compassionate circumstances present.


  51. At page 4 of the secretary  of  state's  reasons  for  refusal  headed
      "Decision under Exceptional Circumstances", she  referred  to  current
      guidance in respect of  "exceptional".  That  meant  circumstances  in
      which refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the
      individual or their family such that refusal of the application  would
      not be proportionate. She  referred  to  and  considered  the  medical
      condition of the claimant's aunt, Ms Akhtar. Her medical condition  is
      set out in accordance with the GP's letters.


  52. She acknowledged that the claimant provides care  and  assistance  for
      his aunt. It is also noted that his aunt receives support and  medical
      treatment from the NHS and other organisations as she is entitled  to.
      She could gain further support, assistance and treatment from the  NHS
      or other social  services  as  she  requires,  to  which  she  may  be
      entitled. Moreover, his aunt  has  been  suffering  from  her  medical
      problems before September 2011 which is the  date  that  the  claimant
      entered the UK. The support that was being provided to her  before  he
      came here could continue or again be sought.


  53. The Judge found  at  [18]  after  applying  the  requirements  of  the
      Immigration  Rules,  that  there  are  exceptional  or   compassionate
      circumstances which could arguably lead to a grant of leave to  remain
      outside the Rules.  The basis upon which he went on  to  consider  the
      claimant's position under Article 8 outside the  rules  was  that  the
      claimant and his wife are in a genuine and subsisting relationship and
      that they otherwise satisfy the requirements for settlement.


  54. He accordingly assessed their claim under the  Razgar  principles.  He
      found that they were in a genuine and subsisting relationship for over
      two and a half years. His wife earned  about  �35,000  per  annum.  It
      would be difficult for her to continue her work  as  a  pharmacist  in
      Pakistan and this would be disruptive for her career and  business  in
      the UK [20].


  55. In finding that there would be a  disproportionate  interference  with
      both his and his wife's family life and that there would  be  no  good
      reason for such settlement application to be made from abroad, he  did
      not include in the assessment the position of the claimant's aunt, but
      only the interference affecting the claimant's and his  wife's  family
      life.


  56. He stated at [21] that after the previous appeal they submitted  their
      financial details to the secretary  of  state  for  consideration;  no
      adverse comment was raised by her. Moreover, he  found  that  "to  all
      intents and purposes" such  a  settlement  application  from  Pakistan
      would succeed [22].


  57. However, under the Rules the substantive conditions which have  to  be
      satisfied in relation to the minimum income requirements for a sponsor
      are stipulated in Appendix FM-SE, which sets out the forms of evidence
      required  to  substantiate  claims  that  the  substantive   financial
      requirements under Appendix FM have been met:   SS  (Congo)  at  [50].
      There has been no finding that as at the date of the hearing there has
      been  compliance  with  these  rigorous  requirements.  There  was  an
      assertion at paragraph 7 of the skeleton  argument  before  the  judge
      that the Tribunal should 'see the attached documents for  evidence  in
      this regard'.  There was no analysis undertaken or any finding made as
      to whether the requirements had been satisfied from the  documentation
      produced.


  58. As noted by the Court of Appeal in SS (Congo),  Appendix  FM-SE  deals
      with matters such as the types of bank  statement,  payslips,  income,
      savings and so forth which will be regarded as acceptable [50].


  59. The Court of Appeal held that the approach to Article 8 in  the  light
      of the Rules in Appendix FM-SE should be the same as in respect of the
      substantive leave to enter and leave to remain rules in  Appendix  FM.
      In other words, the same  general  position  applies,  but  compelling
      circumstances would have to apply to  justify  a  grant  of  leave  to
      remain where the evidence rules are not complied with.


  60. The claimant's application was made at a time when  precarious  family
      life existed. Although that was not addressed by the First-tier Judge,
      the Court of Appeal in Agyarko, supra, has accepted at [30] that it is
      possible that a case might be found to be exceptional for the  purpose
      of the relevant test under Article 8 in relation to precarious  family
      life even where there are no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  continued
      family life overseas.


  61. At [31] it was stated that it is possible to envisage a Chikwamba type
      case arising in which Article 8 might require that leave to remain  be
      granted outside the rules, even though it could not be said that there
      were insurmountable obstacles to the applicant  and  their  spouse  or
      partner continuing their family life overseas.  In  a  case  involving
      precarious family life, it would be necessary to establish that  there
      were exceptional circumstances to warrant such a conclusion.


  62. That did not mean  that  the  issue  whether  there  are  or  are  not
      insurmountable obstacles to relocation drops out of the picture  where
      there is reliance on Article 8. It is a material factor  to  be  taken
      into account.


  63. The First-tier Tribunal found that there  were  such  exceptional  and
      compassionate circumstances that existed, namely the claimant and  his
      wife were in a genuine and subsisting relationship.


  64. The relevant facts were that the claimant entered the UK in  2001.  He
      came as a student with entry clearance valid until 13 October 2012. He
      married his wife on 5 October 2012. They do not have any  children  in
      the UK. They entered into a relationship at a time when the claimant's
      immigration status in the UK was precarious.


  65. There was no claim made by the claimant with  regard  to  family  life
      under paragraph 276ADE and Appendix FM  of  the  rules.  The  claimant
      applied on 11 October 2012 for leave to remain on  the  basis  of  his
      family and private life. Further to the agreement  to  reconsider  his
      application for further  leave  to  remain,  the  secretary  of  state
      considered his application under Article 8 ECHR and the Rules in place
      on 9 July 2012.


  66. In considering his application under the partner route  the  secretary
      of state accepted that he had a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
      with his British partner. Although she had been here all her life  and
      is in employment here this did not mean that they are unable  to  live
      together in Pakistan. Even if this may cause a degree of hardship  for
      his  wife,  there  was  no  evidence  showing  that  there  were   any
      insurmountable obstacles preventing him continuing the relationship in
      Pakistan. He had brothers and sisters who reside there and his British
      partner could live there with the support of his family.


  67. In refusing his application under private life the secretary of  state
      did  not  accept  that  there  would  be  significant   obstacles   of
      integration into Pakistan.


  68. In the light of that background, the finding by the Judge  that  there
      were exceptional or compassionate circumstances on the basis that  the
      claimant and his wife are in a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship,
      did not constitute a sufficient basis which   warranted  consideration
      outside the rules under Article 8.


  69. There was  no  proper  consideration  given  as  to  whether,  in  the
      circumstances, the claimant could make an application from abroad even
      though it might necessitate a short separation pending the outcome  of
      his application for settlement in  the  UK.   Nor  was  it  considered
      whether his spouse could accompany him to Pakistan, even for a limited
      period, pending  the  outcome  of  his  application.   There  were  no
      insurmountable obstacles referred to which prevented the  continuation
      of their relationship in Pakistan for a short period. The claimant has
      parents and sisters who reside in Pakistan  and  with  whom  his  wife
      could live.


  70. Moreover, the finding at [22] that there was no good reason  for  such
      an application to be made from abroad as it would succeed  was  by  no
      means evident from the evidence presented. In particular,  it  is  not
      apparent  that  the  necessary  documentary  evidence   was   produced
      demonstrating that the specified documents required under Appendix FM-
      SE regarding the financial requirements had been satisfied. As  stated
      in SS (Congo), supra, at [52] the evidence rules have the same general
      objective as the substantive rules, namely  to  limit  the  risk  that
      someone is coming to the UK  and  then  becomes  a  burden  on  public
      resources. The secretary of state has the  same  primary  function  in
      relation to them to assess the risk and put in  place  measures  which
      are judged suitable to contain it within acceptable bounds.


  71. As noted at [53], enforcement  of  the  evidence  rules  ensures  that
      everyone applying for leave to enter or leave  to  remain  is  treated
      equally and fairly in relation to  the  evidential  requirements  they
      must satisfy. The application of standard rules is an important  means
      of minimising the risk of arbitrary differences in  the  treatment  of
      cases arising across the wide range of officials, tribunals and courts
      which administer the system of immigration controls. Good reason would
      need to be shown why a  particular  applicant  was  entitled  to  more
      preferential treatment with respect to evidence than other  applicants
      would expect to receive under the rules. If  an  applicant  says  that
      they should be given  more  preferential  treatment  with  respect  to
      evidence  than  the  rules  allow   for,   and   more   individualised
      consideration of their case, good reasons should  be  put  forward  to
      justify that.


  72. In the circumstances, the Judge provided no proper  basis  or  reasons
      justifying his finding that they "otherwise satisfy  the  requirements
      for settlement" [18].  There was no proper assessment  as  to  whether
      the rigorous requirements under the Appendix had been met.  The  Judge
      merely referred to payslips and information from her  accountant  that
      were produced in support [5].


  73.  There  were  thus  no  compelling  circumstances  present  justifying
      acceptance  of  the  sponsor's  income  which  did  not  satisfy   the
      requirement in Appendix FM-SE.


  74. Whilst the Judge did not consider the position  of  the  aunt  in  the
      context of the proportionality of the contemplated  interference,  the
      secretary of state had considered her position in the assessment as to
      whether there were exceptional circumstances. As already  noted,  this
      included the care and assistance that the claimant had given her.  She
      was also receiving support and medical  treatment  from  the  NHS  and
      would be entitled to such treatment and further support and assistance
      including from Social Services which she might require and be entitled
      to. The fact that she prefers the personal care of her nephew and does
      not believe this can be obtained through Social Services did not  mean
      that such proper care would not be available to her.


  75. It is furthermore evident from the medical reports that she  had  been
      suffering from such problems prior to September 2011 when the claimant
      first entered the UK. Appropriate care had been made available to  her
      and would continue to be made available if she were entitled to it.


  76. Although, as noted, it is possible that there may be cases which could
      be exceptional for the purpose of the relevant test under Article 8 in
      relation to precarious life  even  if  there  were  no  insurmountable
      obstacles to continuing family life overseas, this does not mean  that
      the issue as to whether there are or are not insurmountable  obstacles
      to relocation, even for a short period, drops out of the picture where
      there is a reliance on Article 8 - Agyarko, supra, at [30]).


  77. For  the  reasons  already  given,  there  were  no  such  exceptional
      circumstances in this case.


  78. I find that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge involved the
      making of an error on a point of law.  I  accordingly  set  aside  the
      decision and re-make it.  qI  have  set  out  the  contentions  as  to
      whether there were sufficiently compelling reasons in  this  case  for
      granting leave to remain in the UK on Article 8 grounds. However,  for
      the reasons already given, I conclude that no such circumstances  have
      been advanced. There was nothing disproportionate in the secretary  of
      state's  assessment  that  there  would  not  be  any   insurmountable
      obstacles preventing the claimant and his wife from  continuing  their
      relationship in Pakistan.


  79. Nor, for the reasons already given, would there be a  disproportionate
      interference with the Article 8 rights of the claimant and his aunt.


  80. As indicated, it is a matter of choice for the claimant and  Ms  Naeem
      whether or not she would accompany him for a short period to  Pakistan
      whilst his application for settlement  is  being  considered.  If  she
      chooses not to accompany him on  account  of  any  disruption  to  her
      career and business in the UK, the contemplated separation would still
      not constitute a disproportionate interference with their family life.




  81. There is moreover nothing disproportionate in the secretary of state's
      requiring that the claim be made from abroad, in which  the  financial
      requirements under Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE must be set out  and
      satisfied. The evidence rules have not been  properly  shown  to  have
      been met either at the date of the application or at the date  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision.


  82. In giving effect to the need to meet the public interest which  is  in
      issue, the requirement that  the  claimant  make  an  entry  clearance
      application  from  abroad  does  not  constitute  a   disproportionate
      interference with his/their right to respect for family life.


      Notice of Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error of law and the decision is  set  aside.  I  substitute  a  fresh
      decision for that decision dismissing the claimant's appeal.


      No anonymity direction is made.
