For the Respondent/Claimant:    Mr V Makol, Legal Representative, Maalik &
Co, Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing on Article 8 grounds the claimant's
    appeal against the decision by the Secretary of  State  to  refuse  him
    leave to enter the United Kingdom, and to cancel his leave to enter  as
    a Tier 4 General Student Migrant. Although the First-tier Tribunal  did
    not make an anonymity direction, the best interests of  minor  children
    affected by the refusal of leave  to  enter  have  since  assumed  more
    importance and so it is appropriate  to  accord  them,  and  hence  the
    claimant, anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The claimant, who is a national of India, was granted leave to enter as
    a student in July 2009 and leave to remain as a  student  on  9  August
    2012  in  order  to  follow  an  extended  Diploma  in   Business   and
    Administrative Management at the Citizen 2000 Education Institute.  His
    leave to remain in this capacity ran until 30 August 2014.

 3. On 27 January 2014 he flew back to India, and on 8 March 2014  he  flew
    out of India.  On his arrival at Heathrow Airport on 9 March  2014,  he
    was interviewed. He said he was studying at the Citizen 2000  Education
    Institute, and had commenced his studies in April  2012.   Home  Office
    checks with the institute established that  they  had  withdrawn  their
    sponsorship on the basis that the claimant had not attended any  lesson
    and had failed to repay the required course fee for  the  course  which
    was due to commence on 9 August 2012.  They also established  that  the
    institute's licence had been revoked since 6 February 2014.

 4. The claimant was issued with a notice of refusal of leave to  enter  on
    10 March 2014 on the ground that the Immigration Officer was  satisfied
    that false representations were employed or  material  facts  were  not
    disclosed for the purpose of obtaining leave, or there had been such  a
    change of circumstances in his case since the leave  had  been  granted
    that it should be cancelled.

 5. The claimant initially appealed solely on the ground that he was a bona
    fide student, who had been in regular attendance at his  college.   The
    college was made aware of his sudden departure from the UK  in  January
    2014 due to his sister's death in India.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The claimant's appeal came before Judge Wyman sitting in the First-tier
    Tribunal at Hatton Cross  on  23  September  2014,  and  (following  an
    adjournment) at Richmond Magistrates Court on 19 November 2014.  By the
    time that the appeal came  before  her,  the  claimant  had  raised  an
    additional ground of appeal,  which  was  that  he  should  be  granted
    limited leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  as  the  partner  of  a
    British national.

 7. At the initial hearing on 23 September 2014, Mr Makol on behalf of  the
    claimant  acknowledged  that  he  could  not   meet   the   maintenance
    requirements set out in Appendix FM.   He  was  married  to  a  British
    national who had four children from her previous marriage.  She  was  a
    widow, and the children were aged from 5 to 13.   The  claimant's  wife
    was not working as she was caring for the children.

 8. At the resumed hearing on 19 November 2014,  the  judge  received  oral
    evidence from the claimant and his wife, Ms K.  He  gave  his  evidence
    through a Punjabi interpreter, and she gave her  evidence  in  English.
    The claimant said he had met Ms K at the gurdwara (temple) in  November
    2013.  He had been attending this gurdwara regularly since first coming
    to the United Kingdom in 2009.  Ms  K's  uncle  was  President  of  the
    gurdwara.  Initially, he spoke to her parents, but he also spoke to  Ms
    K herself at the temple.  They had got engaged at the end  of  November
    2014.  However due to his sister's death, he  then  had  to  leave  the
    country as an emergency.  The wedding had to be postponed  until  after
    his return from India, and until after his release from  detention.  He
    was released on bail on 14 April 2014.  They had a religious wedding at
    the temple on 25 May 2014, and they had a  civil  wedding  on  11  July
    2014.  He now lived with her wife and her four children at  an  address
    in Kestrel Court, Hounslow.

 9. He communicated with his wife in  Punjabi.   She  was  originally  from
    Afghanistan.  His parents had not come to the wedding.  But his  wife's
    parents had travelled to India to meet his parents before the  wedding.
    His wife had not been able to accompany her parents on  this  trip,  as
    she had to stay to look after the children.

10. In her evidence, Ms K confirmed that she had met the  claimant  at  the
    gurdwara in November 2013, and had become engaged to  him  in  December
    2013.  It was an arranged marriage.  Her family had  decided  that  she
    should remarry as she was still young.  Her first husband had died over
    two years ago.  She had never worked in the UK.  Her first husband  had
    been disabled and suffered from epilepsy.  She stayed at home  to  look
    after both the children and him.  She confirmed that she knew that  the
    claimant only had a temporary visa as a student.

11. In her subsequent  decision,  Judge  Wyman  set  out  her  findings  at
    paragraph [59] onwards.  She  concluded  at  paragraph  [75]  that  the
    Secretary of State was correct  to  cancel  the  claimant's  continuing
    leave and to refuse him leave to enter the United Kingdom as a student.
     While he may have been a  genuine  student  previously,  the  claimant
    clearly had not been a genuine student since September 2013.

12. At paragraph [78], she formally dismissed  the  claimant's  application
    for leave to remain as a  partner  under  the  Rules,  as  neither  the
    claimant nor his wife met the relevant income threshold of �18,600  per
    annum.

13. She went on to address an  Article  8  claim  outside  the  Rules.   At
    paragraph [107] she said she did not think it would be  reasonable  for
    the sponsor to leave her home and move to India to be with her husband.
     At paragraph [113] she reached the following conclusion:

         "Taking all the evidence into  consideration,  given  that  I  have
         found that it is a genuine and subsisting marriage, it would  be  a
         disproportionate interference with the sponsor's right  to  respect
         for her private and family life if the [claimant]  is  not  granted
         leave to remain in the United Kingdom."

The Application for Permission to Appeal

14. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal, advancing four
    grounds.  Ground 1 was the judge  had  failed  to  resolve  a  material
    conflict as to the claimant's credibility.  It  was  incumbent  on  the
    judge to consider his credibility in the light of his previous  attempt
    to gain entry by deception.

15. Ground 2 was the judge had failed to resolve material conflict arising,
    inter alia, from the inconsistencies which she noted between  the  oral
    evidence  of  the  claimant  and  the  sponsor.   She  noted  that  the
    discrepancies  included  whether  or  not  the  sponsor  was  given  an
    engagement ring, the month  of  the  engagement,  whether  they  talked
    together on the first introduction and the colour of  the  front  door.
    These inconsistencies were significant.  The claimant and  the  sponsor
    gave different answers to questions they  reasonably  would  have  been
    expected to have known the answers to.  Non-genuine couples will  often
    be able to give substantially consistent and rehearsed  evidence.   The
    judge had  failed  to  explain  how  these  discrepancies  were  to  be
    explained, other than by dishonesty.  Moreover,  the  inconsistency  in
    the oral evidence should have been  considered  in  the  light  of  the
    claimant's previous attempt to gain entry by  deception;  the  marriage
    taking place within three months of the claimant's refusal at port; and
    the  apparent  paucity  of  documentary  evidence  to   establish   co-
    habitation.

16. Ground 3 was the judge  had  failed  to  apply  the  Immigration  Rules
    correctly.  In  particular,  the  judge  had  not  considered  EX.1  in
    Appendix FM.  The judge  had  erred  by  failing  to  engage  with  the
    considerations of EX.1A(ii), EX.1B and EX.2.

17. Ground 4 was that the  judge  had  failed  properly  to  apply  primary
    legislation.  While she had given some consideration to the  provisions
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as amended  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014, no  attempt  had  been  made  to  apply  the  key
    consideration of financial  independence  to  the  facts.  The  judge's
    broader  consideration  of  Section  117B  was   also   incomplete   or
    inadequately reasoned.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

18. On 30 January 2015 Judge Hollingworth granted permission to  appeal  on
    all grounds raised.

The Error of Law Hearing

19. At the hearing before me to determine an error of law, Mr Makol mounted
    a robust defence of the judge's decision.  He relied in part  for  this
    purpose on a Rule 24 response that he had sent to the Upper Tribunal on
    16 April 2015.  He drew my attention to the fact that in  the  case  of
    Dube [2015] UKUT 90 (IAC) it was held that Sections 117A-117D  did  not
    represent any kind of radical departure from or  override  of  previous
    case law on Article 8, so far as the need for a structured approach was
    concerned.  Sections 117A-117D were essentially a  further  elaboration
    of Razgar's question 5, which was essentially about proportionality and
    justifiability.

20. The judge may not have considered financial independence properly,  but
    she had looked at every  factor  which  needed  to  be  considered  for
    question 5 of the Razgar test to be answered.  It could  not  be  right
    that the lack of financial independence could override the  many  other
    factors which she had  listed  in  paragraphs  [86]  to  [114]  of  her
    decision.  These included the fact there  were  four  British  children
    involved, and that the claimant was never an overstayer.

21. Having received extensive submissions from both  parties,  I  ruled  in
    favour of the Secretary of State.  I gave my reasons for so finding  in
    short form, and my extended reasons are set out below.

22. There was then further discussion on the issue of the forum  and  scope
    of the re-making of the decision.  It was agreed that there would be  a
    resumed hearing before me in the Upper Tribunal to re-make the decision
    under Article 8 with a time estimate of two hours.  Mr Makol  indicated
    he wished to adduce further evidence to support the disputed claim that
    the marriage between the claimant  and  the  sponsor  was  genuine  and
    subsisting, and on the question  of  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    sponsor relocating with the children to India; and/or on the  topic  of
    whether such relocation would be unreasonable and unjustifiably  harsh.
    As neither party was contending that the judge's findings of  fact  on,
    or pertaining to, any of these questions should be  preserved,  I  gave
    permission to the claimant for new  evidence  on  these  topics  to  be
    adduced, provided that such new evidence was contained in  a  paginated
    and indexed  bundle  to  be  served  on  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  the
    Specialist Appeals Team not less than seven  days  before  the  resumed
    hearing.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

23. In his detailed skeleton argument before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  Mr
    Makol submitted that the  claimant  fulfilled  the  exemption  criteria
    contained in EX.1.  Judge Wyman wholly failed to address this  question
    in her decision.

24. She rightly dealt with one potential avenue under Appendix FM by  which
    the claimant could qualify for leave to remain  as  the  partner  of  a
    person  present  and  settled  here,   namely   where   the   financial
    requirements are met.  But she did not address the alternative route by
    which the claimant could obtain leave to remain as  the  partner  of  a
    person present and settled  here,  which  is  the  route  contained  in
    EX.1(b).  This is where the applicant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with a partner who is in the UK and is a British  citizen,
    settled in the UK or in the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or  humanitarian
    protection, and there are insurmountable obstacles to family life  with
    that partner continuing outside the UK.

25.  EX.2  provides  that   for   the   purposes   of   paragraph   EX.1(b)
    "insurmountable obstacles"  means  the  very  significant  difficulties
    which would be faced by the applicant or their  partner  in  continuing
    their family life together outside  the  UK  and  which  could  not  be
    overcome or would entail very serious hardship  for  the  applicant  or
    their partner.

26.  As  a  result  of  not  addressing  EX.1,  the  judge's   freewheeling
    proportionality assessment outside the Rules was fatally  flawed.   For
    establishing that there were not  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family
    life between the claimant and Ms Kaur continuing in India was, and  is,
    an essential pre-cursor to an  informed  and  balanced  proportionality
    assessment outside the Rules.

27. Although  the  claimant  does  not  have  to  establish  insurmountable
    obstacles to succeed in an Article  8  claim  outside  the  Rules,  the
    question of whether it is reasonable to expect the sponsor to  relocate
    to India is to a significant degree influenced by  the  outcome  of  an
    assessment under EX.1(b).

28. The  judge's  proportionality  assessment  was  also  flawed  in  other
    respects.  Firstly, the judge appears to have given no weight at all to
    the fact that the parties had allegedly become engaged at the time when
    it was known that the claimant only had limited leave to  remain  as  a
    student, and they had proceeded to get married in  the  full  knowledge
    that the claimant had been refused  leave  to  enter,  and  was  facing
    removal.  Secondly, the judge wrongly  characterised  the  claimant  as
    having a good previous immigration history "save for the  fact  that  I
    have found that he has not been a genuine student for the academic year
    commencing September 2013."  The judge's reason for holding that he had
    a good previous immigration history is that  he  had  never  previously
    overstayed his leave: see paragraphs [89] and  [112].   But  the  judge
    thereby overlooked the fact that the claimant's  immigration  offending
    was just as bad as that of an overstayer, and arguably worse,  in  that
    he had remained in the United Kingdom when he knew that he  was  not  a
    genuine student; and so the Rule under which he had sought and obtained
    leave to remain no longer applied to him.

29. Moreover, it followed from the judge's finding that he had not  been  a
    genuine student since the academic year commencing September 2013  that
    he had dishonestly sought to re-enter the United Kingdom in March  2014
    under the guise of being a genuine student.

30. The judge had the benefit of receiving oral evidence from the  claimant
    and the sponsor at a lengthy hearing on 19 November 2014, and the judge
    was not bound to conclude that the claimant's dishonesty with regard to
    his activities as a student was  fatal  to  the  proposition  that  his
    marriage to Ms K was genuine and subsisting.  But the judge  failed  to
    give adequate reasons for finding that the  marriage  was  genuine  and
    subsisting, as opposed to the marriage  being  entered  into  with  the
    predominant purpose of enabling him to remain in the UK, in  the  light
    of (a) the claimant's adverse  immigration  history,  (b)  the  judge's
    implicit finding of dishonesty, (c) the  inconsistencies  in  the  oral
    evidence noted by the judge, and (d) the timing of the marriage.

31. For the above reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing
    the claimant's appeal on Article 8 grounds is vitiated  by  a  material
    error of law, such that  the  decision  should  be  set  aside  in  its
    entirety and re-made.

Directions for the Resumed Hearing

32. My directions for the resumed hearing included  a  direction  that  the
    findings of fact made by the judge at paragraphs [59] to [77] would  be
    preserved. I further directed:

         "None of the findings of fact made in the context of the Article  8
         claim will be formally preserved, although many  of  them  will  be
         uncontroversial, such as the  ages  of  the  children  and  various
         aspects of Ms K's background history.  The judge  did  not  make  a
         finding about the status of the  claimant's  relationship  with  Ms
         Kaur's children, and so this remains an unresolved question."

The Resumed Hearing

33. The claimant's solicitors filed a  considerable  volume  of  additional
    documentary evidence for the purposes  of  the  resumed  hearing.   The
    evidence included the following email from the Sikh Academy attended by
    Ms K's eldest daughter.  In an  email  dated  4  June  2015  the  child
    protection officer said to Ms K:

         "[A] has seen me regarding information needed which she  wished  to
         present to court regarding issue about her step-dad's residency  in
         the UK.  She wants me to say his positive influence in her life has
         resulted in her stopping her counselling  as  this  was  no  longer
         needed.  I understand you have also requested  to  speak  with  her
         counsellor regarding this.  I have chatted to  her  counsellor  and
         she said she cannot respond to this.

         Also from the school point of view  we  also  cannot  make  similar
         comments.

         What we can say is the same as what I sent you  in  November,  that
         is:

         "Dear Mrs K

         This is to confirm A is a student in year 9 at [named  school]  and
         she had counselling at  school  from  March  2014  until  September
         2014." "

34. I received oral evidence from the claimant,  his  wife  and  his  step-
    daughter  A.   The  claimant  gave  his  evidence  through  a   Punjabi
    interpreter whom he clearly understood.  He adopted as his evidence-in-
    chief a supplementary witness statement which he signed in my presence.
     There was nothing fake  about  their  marriage.   They  provided  many
    letters of support from family and friends acknowledging that they were
    in a genuine marriage.  He would also like to state that their extended
    family in the United Kingdom had offered him prospective jobs if he was
    granted a visa.  He had accepted K's children as his  own  as  she  had
    come to learn that she was widowed.  He had formed a  close  bond  with
    her four children.  K was now six months' pregnant with his child,  and
    she could not travel abroad.  K she  was  not  working,  she  had  four
    children and now was pregnant.  She obtained  some  public  funds,  for
    which she was entitled to for her family.  She also obtained  financial
    help from her family, which was vast, and they helped out as  often  as
    they could.  This meant that he was not relying on public funds.

35. He would not be happy to have his child born in India due to  the  lack
    of medical training there.  He also did not have faith in the treatment
    his wife would receive.  He believed it would be unfair for him to have
    to return to India to apply to re-join his wife, and also she could not
    possibly meet the financial requirements,  as  she  did  not  earn  the
    monies the Home Office needed.

36. In cross-examination, he was asked to explain what had taken  place  at
    the engagement in November 2013.  He said his wife's uncle had arranged
    for them to meet at the gurdwara,  and  they  had  a  chat.   He  asked
    whether there was an engagement ceremony.  He said they had to keep  it
    quiet because her husband had died recently (in 2012) and she had  four
    children.  For cultural reasons, they could not announce the engagement
    publicly.  They did not have a celebration within the  family  as  they
    did not want the news to leak out to the community.  He saw his  future
    wife at the temple every Sunday before going to India for his  sister's
    funeral (she died on 15 January 2014) and  they  also  chatted  on  the
    telephone every night.  He was asked whether there was anybody  outside
    the family who could confirm the engagement.  He answered  he  did  not
    know.  There might have been onlookers.

37. The claimant confirmed that his wife's parents to India had  flown  out
    to meet his parents in April 2014,  after  he  had  been  arrested  and
    refused leave to enter.  It was put to him that  the  marriage  in  May
    2014 was one of convenience.  The claimant responded that his wife  had
    tried to get bail for him after he was arrested.  She was not  able  to
    get bail because she was not working.  But her uncle was able to  stand
    surety for him.

38. He was asked when he had first met his wife's children.  He said he saw
    them in the temple, but he met them for the first time after they  were
    married.  He had  however  talked  to  them  on  the  telephone  before
    marriage.  He agreed that he had been only part of  their  lives  since
    May 2014, which was just over a year.  He  was  asked  why  the  family
    could not move to India.  He said they were safe  here  and  they  were
    British born.  India was not safe for girls.  Also his wife  was  seven
    months' pregnant, and she was due to give birth in September.   So  she
    could not travel.  Every day there was news of rape  in  India  on  the
    BBC.  He was asked whether he explained his immigration status  to  his
    future wife.  He said he had told his  wife  everything  very  clearly.
    His wife could bring him back from India.  If he had not  been  refused
    leave to enter, he would have tried his best to extend his  visa.   But
    if not, he would have gone back to seek entry clearance.

39. In re-examination, he was  asked  to  expand  on  the  father  daughter
    relationship she said he enjoyed with A and her  younger  sister.   The
    appellant described what they had  done  on  Father's  Day.  The  whole
    family had gone to a vegetarian Asian restaurant by the name  of  Chini
    Chor.

40. Ms K adopted as her  evidence-in-chief  a  witness  statement  she  had
    signed in my presence.  She did not work when  her  first  husband  was
    alive, as he suffered from epilepsy.  She  said  she  still  could  not
    work.  But because of the claimant's presence, she had recently started
    a course.

41. In answer to supplementary questions from Mr Makol, she confirmed  that
    they had got engaged in November 2013.  There was no celebration as she
    was a widow, and her family did not want to spread  it  out  too  much.
    She was asked when her husband had first met the children.  She said it
    was before the engagement, when they were talking.  The girls  met  him
    regularly in November.  The girls and boys met him regularly, and  they
    were a part of it.  The girls were happy with him.  Since the marriage,
    it was a big change especially with the elder one, A.  She was  getting
    depression.  But she was  so  happy  after  the  marriage.   The  child
    protection officer called her after the marriage to say that A  was  so
    happy and she did not need to continue with her counselling.  A did not
    like to stay away from home now.  She used to stay away.

42. In cross-examination, she said her family had attended  a  ceremony  to
    mark the engagement at the gurdwara.  The ceremony  was  called  ardass
    and it was conducted by a resident granithi.  She could not say  why  a
    statement from the granithi had not been obtained.

43. She was now doing a level 1 beauty course.  She was not educated enough
    at present to do any kind of job.  She was willing to go  on  to  do  a
    level 2 beauty course, and to use this qualification to get a job in  a
    salon as a receptionist.

44. She went on to give a detailed account of  what  the  family  had  done
    together on Father's Day, including attending the Chini Chor Restaurant
    in Hounslow.

45. A was the final witness, and she adopted as her  evidence-in-chief  her
    witness  statement  signed  by  her  on  21  November  2014.   In  this
    statement, she said she was 14 years old.  After her father passed away
    on 31 March 2012, she had been taking counselling sessions at a school.
     This was because she was very depressed and her  life  was  miserable.
    Also she was never happy.  But after her mum got married to G, her life
    had changed.  She had got the fatherly love she had missed in past  two
    years.  G, whom she called dad, had always  been  there  for  her,  and
    always made her happy.  He had never let her down.  For this reason she
    was happier in life, and her grades were getting better in school.   As
    she was more happy and cheerful because of dad,  she  had  stopped  her
    counselling sessions and did not go any more as there was no  need.   G
    was the most understanding and amazing father a little girl could have.
     He had made her and her family happier than ever, and  she  was  happy
    that her mum had married him.  He always made her brothers  and  sister
    cheerful, and he also never let them be sad.  She really hoped  he  was
    allowed to stay with her mum and us as a family in the United Kingdom.

46. In answer to supplementary questions  from  Mr  Makol,  she  said  that
    before she had counselling, she was aggressive and had anger management
    problems.  There was no improvement after her counselling.  It was  her
    step-father who made her better.  That was  why  she  had  stopped  her
    counselling sessions.  There was no point in sending him back to India,
    it would ruin everyone's life.  She had not been to India since she was
    aged 2.  There was no cross-examination.

47. Also present at court were a number of  supporting  witnesses  whom  Mr
    Makol did not call to give oral evidence, but who had  provided  signed
    statements or letters of support.  Of the family members who  attended,
    Mrs B's letter at page 58 of the  supplementary  bundle  is  reasonably
    representative.  She is the mother of Ms K.   She  confirmed  that  her
    daughter and G had got married  on  25  May  2014  according  to  their
    religion, and their civil marriage was on 11  July  2014.   Ever  since
    they had been living together.  She and her husband had gone  to  India
    to visit the parents of G to arrange the marriage.   Since  her  second
    marriage, her daughter had started to be happy in life again  and  also
    her children seemed to be more joyful.





Discussion and Findings on Remaking

48. The first question which I have  to  decide  is  whether  the  marriage
    between the claimant and Ms K is genuine and  subsisting,  and  whether
    the  parties  to  the  marriage  genuinely  intend  to  live   together
    permanently as husband and wife.  On the debit side,  one  of  the  key
    discrepancies which emerged at the hearing in the  First-tier  Tribunal
    resurfaced.  Before the First-tier Tribunal, Ms K said  that  they  got
    engaged in December 2013, whereas the claimant said that they had  been
    engaged in November 2013.  Although both of them adhered to a  November
    2013 date in their evidence before me, the  thrust  of  the  claimant's
    evidence was that there was no ceremony to mark the engagement, whereas
    Ms K said that there was, and gave a detailed description of  what  the
    ceremony consisted of and who had presided at it.  Another  discrepancy
    emerged for the first  time.  This  was  over  the  contact  which  the
    claimant had with Ms K's children before their marriage.  K's  evidence
    was that her children met the claimant at  the  gurdwara  before  their
    engagement, and gave their seal of approval to the proposed engagement.
     But the claimant said he had not met the children at all  until  after
    they got married, and he had merely seen them at the gurdwara, but  not
    spoken to them at the gurdwara - albeit that he had spoken to  them  on
    the telephone during the week.

49. I note that family members such as the claimant's mother-in-law do  not
    in terms confirm that the couple became formally  engaged  in  November
    2013 or indeed at any point prior to the claimant going back  to  India
    in the middle  of  January  for  his  sister's  funeral.   It  is  also
    significant that the parents of Ms K did not  go  out  to  India  until
    April 2014 to arrange the marriage.  I  question  whether  there  could
    have been a formal engagement between the couple  before  the  marriage
    had been arranged to the satisfaction of not only Ms  K's  family,  but
    also the claimant's family.

50. So I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that there was  a
    formal engagement before the claimant left  for  India,  and  for  that
    reason the claimant rightly did not claim that he had a fianc�e in  the
    UK when he was interviewed on his return.

51. However Ms K's involvement in an unsuccessful  attempt  to  secure  the
    claimant's release on bail is consistent with her family having  raised
    the possibility of marriage before  the  claimant's  departure,  and  I
    consider that in all probability  there  were  mixed  motives  for  the
    marriage between the couple taking place when  it  did.  Both  families
    recognised that the claimant needed to get married urgently in order to
    facilitate him being able to remain in the UK.  At the same time it was
    not a sham marriage.   The  most  powerful  testament  to  the  marital
    relationship being a genuine and subsisting one is the fact that  Ms  K
    is now carrying a child fathered by the claimant.   In  addition,  they
    gave a credible and consistent account of  their  recent  family  life.
    Accordingly, the eligibility requirement that was put in  issue  by  Mr
    Bramble is shown to be met.

52. As the claimant cannot qualify for limited leave to remain as a partner
    of a British national by meeting the financial requirements, he has  to
    show that there are insurmountable obstacles to family  life  with  his
    partner being carried on in India.  Mr Bramble questioned  whether  the
    claimant could take advantage of the exemption criteria in EX.1 on  the
    ground that he did not meet one of the suitability  requirements.   But
    an overstayer is  not  precluded  from  taking  advantage  of  EX.1  on
    suitability  grounds  and,  from  an   immigration   perspective,   the
    claimant's conduct is not as bad as that  of  an  overstayer.   In  the
    light of the First-tier Tribunal Judge's preserved  findings  of  fact,
    the claimant's student leave was liable to curtailment from the  autumn
    of 2013 as he had stopped studying.  But it was not actually  curtailed
    until he was refused leave to enter, and  his  extant  leave  was  then
    converted into Section 3C leave consequential upon him being  permitted
    to pursue an in-country appeal against a decision to refuse  him  leave
    to enter. Accordingly, the claimant can avail himself of the  exemption
    criteria contained in EX.1.

53. However, I find that the claimant has  not  discharged  the  burden  of
    proving that he could bring himself within EX.1(b).  He  and  his  wife
    entered  into  marriage  in  the  full  knowledge  of  the   claimant's
    precarious immigration status, and so both of them took the  risk  that
    they might not be allowed to  carry  on  married  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom as opposed to in the claimant's country of return, India.  Ms K
    and the claimant were brought together by their shared adherence to the
    Sikh faith, and their common cultural and social bonds as  Sikhs.   The
    claimant's family in India live in a state adjacent to Punjab province,
    and thus not far from the Golden Temple of Amritsar to which Ms K  made
    a religious pilgrimage with her elder daughter some ten to twelve years
    ago.  Ms K lived in a Sikh community in Afghanistan until 1998, and re-
    settling in India with the claimant and  his  family  would  involve  a
    perpetuation of  the  familiar  rather  than  having  to  adjust  to  a
    different set of cultural, religious or social  values.   No  objective
    evidence has been brought forward to sustain the proposition that there
    is a real risk per se in India  for  young  women  being  subjected  to
    sexual abuse, and in any event there is no reason to suppose  that  the
    claimant and his family would not  ensure  that  the  claimant's  step-
    daughters were kept free from harm.  The fact  that  Ms  K  has  become
    naturalised as a British citizen does not give her the right to  insist
    that she carries on family life in the UK, rather than in India, simply
    because of her British national status and the British national  status
    of her children.  Absent compassionate circumstances, the  requirements
    of the Rules have to be met, and the evidence falls very far  short  of
    establishing that there are insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    between the claimant and Ms K being carried on in India.

54. But as Mr Bramble acknowledged, there is  another  potential  route  by
    which the claimant can qualify for limited leave to  remain.   This  is
    under EX.1(a) which corresponds to Section 117B(6) of the 2002  Act  as
    amended by the Immigration Act 2014.  Although the claimant  is  not  a
    biological father, he can still be treated as a  parent  by  virtue  of
    being a step-father.

55. A useful summary of the learning on the best interests of  children  in
    the context of immigration is to be found the determination  of  Azimi-
    Moayed & Others (decisions affecting children; onward  appeals)  [2013]
    UKUT 197 (IAC):

         "30. It is not the case that the best interests principle means  it
             is automatically in the interests of any child to be permitted
             to remain in the United Kingdom, irrespective of  age,  length
             of stay, family background or other circumstances.   The  case
             law  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  has  identified  the  following
             principles to assist in the  determination  of  appeals  where
             children are affected by the decisions:

             (i)  As a starting point in the best interests of children  to
                  be with both their parents and if both parents  are  being
                  removed from the United Kingdom then  the  starting  point
                  suggests that so should dependent children who  form  part
                  of  their  household  unless  there  are  reasons  to  the
                  contrary.

             (ii) It is generally in the interests of children to have both
                  stability  and  continuity  of  social   and   educational
                  provision and the benefit of growing up  in  the  cultural
                  norms of the society to which they belong.

             (iii)    Lengthy residence in a country other than  the  state
                  of origin can lead to development of social, cultural  and
                  educational  ties  that  it  would  be  inappropriate   to
                  disrupt, in the  absence  of  compelling  reasons  to  the
                  contrary.  What amounts to lengthy residence is not  clear
                  cut but past and present policies  have  identified  seven
                  years as a relevant period.

             (iv) Apart from the terms of published policies and Rules, the
                  Tribunal notes that seven years from age 4 is likely to be
                  more significant to a child than the first seven years  of
                  life.  Very young children are focused  on  their  parents
                  rather than peers and are adaptable.

             (v)  Short periods of  residence,  particularly  ones  without
                  leave or the reasonable expectation of leave to  enter  or
                  remain, while claims are promptly considered, are unlikely
                  to give rise to private life deserving of respect  in  the
                  absence of exceptional factors.  In any event,  protection
                  of the  economic  wellbeing  of  society  amply  justifies
                  removal in such cases."

56. The following observations of the Court  of  Appeal  in  JW  (China)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1526  are
    also pertinent:

         "22. In my view the correct approach is very well summarised in the
             Upper Tribunal decision of MK (Best interests of child) [2011]
             UKUT 00475 (IAC), where this was said at paragraphs 23 and  24
             of the determination:

                  "...If, for example, all the factors weighing in the  best
                  interests of the child consideration point  overwhelmingly
                  in favour of the child and/or relevant  parents  remaining
                  in the UK, that is very likely to mean  that  very  strong
                  countervailing factors can outweigh it.  If, at the  other
                  extreme,  all  the  factors  of  relevance  to  the   best
                  interests of the child consideration (save for the child's
                  and/or parents own claim that they want to  remain)  point
                  overwhelmingly to the child's interest being  best  served
                  by him returning with his parents to his country of origin
                  ...  then   very   little   by   way   of   countervailing
                  considerations to do with immigration control etc. may  be
                  necessary in order for the  conclusion  to  be  drawn  the
                  decision appealed against was and is proportionate." "

57. It is a matter of concern that there is no  independent  evidence  from
    the schools attended by the children of  the  paternal  role  that  the
    claimant is said to have played  in  the  children's  lives  since  the
    summer of 2014.  Of even greater concern is the content  of  the  email
    from the child protection officer at the Sikh Academy  attended  by  A.
    Her rights as a child include waiving her right to  confidentiality  in
    the exchanges which she has had with the counsellor at school.   It  is
    reasonable to  question  why  neither  the  counsellor  nor  the  child
    protection officer are prepared  to  go  on  record  as  affirming  the
    positive role that A says the claimant has played in her life since his
    marriage to her mother.  Had it not been for A's oral evidence, I would
    have been inclined to interpret the email  from  the  child  protection
    officer as a coded message that things were not  as  they  seemed,  and
    that in truth neither A nor the school regarded the claimant as  having
    assumed a paternal role in A's life; and that the reason for A stopping
    counselling  had  nothing  to  do  with  her   step-father's   positive
    influence.

58. In view of when the counselling began  and  when  it  ended,  I  remain
    sceptical (in the absence of independent confirmation) that the  reason
    why the counselling came to an end in September 2014  was  because,  as
    her mother put it, A was so happy with  the  marriage.   If  that  were
    true, the counselling should have started and stopped much sooner.

59. But in the assessment of a child's best interests, a vital component is
    listening to the child herself.  I found her evidence persuasive.  I do
    not consider that her evidence was rehearsed, or that she was  feigning
    her devotion to the claimant, or her feelings about the essential  role
    as a father figure which he now played in her life and the life of  her
    younger siblings.  Accordingly, I find that the claimant has discharged
    the burden of proving that he has a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with a qualifying child.  Although I did not hear from any
    of the younger children, I am prepared to accept that  he  also  has  a
    genuine and subsisting parental relationship  with  them  as  well.   I
    focus on the eldest child, A, as she has  the  strongest  private  life
    claim, by virtue of her age, and hence her length of residence  in  the
    UK.  Although from a family life perspective, her best interests lie in
    her remaining with the family unit wherever it happens to  be,  from  a
    private life  perspective,  her  best  interests  clearly  lie  in  her
    continuing her secondary education in the UK, and continuing  to  enjoy
    until the age of her majority all the  benefits  and  advantages  which
    flow from her British national status.  Although the  hardship  to  her
    consequential upon the relocation of the family to India will  to  some
    extent be tempered by the considerations to  which  I  referred  in  my
    discussion of insurmountable obstacles, I  consider  this  has  only  a
    marginal impact on where her case lies on the spectrum identified in JW
    (China).

60. Turning to the wider proportionality assessment, there are  undoubtedly
    factors  which  militate  in  favour   of   the   claimant's   removal.
    Immigration control is a desirable end in itself, and it is not in  the
    public interest for migrants to be seen as  successfully  circumventing
    the Rules.  If the claimant  was  applying  for  entry  clearance  from
    India, he would not be able to rely on EX.1, and he would only be  able
    to obtain entry clearance as and when his wife earned an annual  income
    of at least �18,600 per annum.  The claimant is clearly not  fluent  in
    English, as he gave his evidence through a Punjabi interpreter.  He  is
    also not financially independent.  On the other hand, his  presence  in
    the family unit should  assist  in  the  family  coming  off  benefits.
    Firstly, there is  no  reason  to  suppose  that  the  claimant  cannot
    undertake gainful  employment,  once  he  is  allowed  to  do  so,  and
    secondly, by sharing in childcare  responsibilities,  he  can  make  it
    easier for his wife to take up gainful employment.  If the claimant was
    a significant immigration offender,  the  scales  might  be  tipped  in
    favour of enforcement of immigration controls.  But,  for  the  reasons
    given earlier, I find that the claimant is not disqualified from taking
    the benefit of EX.1(a) on the ground that he does not meet one  of  the
    suitability requirements.   So,  having  considered  all  the  relevant
    factors, I find that the claimant succeeds in his appeal under  EX.1(a)
    and under Section 117B(6).  I find it would not be reasonable for child
    A to leave the United Kingdom.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted: this appeal is allowed under Appendix FM of the Rules.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
