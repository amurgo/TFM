Representation:
For the Appellants:    The sponsor, RM
For the Respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Before the Upper Tribunal the Secretary of State becomes the appellant.
     However, for the avoidance of confusion and to be consistent, I  shall
    continue to refer to the parties as they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.



Anonymity

 2. As this appeal involves the interests of  young  children  I  make  the
    following direction:

    DIRECTION REGARDING ANONYMITY -  RULE  14  OF  THE  TRIBUNAL  PROCEDURE
    (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008


    Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269)  I  make  an  anonymity  order.   Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings
    or any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly
    identify the original appellant.  This direction  applies  to,  amongst
    others, all parties.  Any failure to comply with this  direction  could
    give rise to contempt of court proceedings.

Background

 3. The first appellant is the mother of the second appellant who was  born
    on 8th November 2013.  The sponsor is the first  appellant's  wife  and
    father of  the  second  appellant.   The  appellants  are  citizens  of
    Pakistan and the sponsor is a British citizen.

 4. In a renewed application to the Upper Tribunal permission  was  granted
    to the respondent to appeal against the decision of Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Somal in which  she  allowed  the  appeal  on  Article  8
    grounds against the decision of the respondent  taken  on  15  December
    2014 to refuse entry clearance, respectively, as a  partner  and  child
    under the provisions of Appendix FM and FM-SE of the Immigration Rules.



 5. In a decision dated 7th May 2016  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Davey
    found that the decision of the First-tier Judge contained an error on a
    point of law such that it should be set aside and re-made on Article  8
    grounds only. That was because the First-tier judge had  embarked  upon
    consideration of Article 8 issues without properly considering  whether
    there were compelling circumstances which could  show  that  Article  8
    should be looked at outside the Immigration Rules on the basis set  out
    by the Court of Appeal in  SS(Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387.  Judge  Davey
    also decided that any fault in the review of the refusal by  the  Entry
    Clearance manager was not judiciable.  He then directed  that  the  re-
    making of the appeal should take place in  the  Upper  Tribunal  before
    him.

 6. The resumed hearing was initially set to take place on 11th  July  2016
    at the Stoke Hearing Centre but it appears that this date was adjourned
    to 12th September 2016 when the matter was put in my list.  It  is  not
    clear from the Tribunal file  whether  this  was  done  by  mistake  or
    design.  However, having regard  to  the  requirement  to  re-make  the
    appeal on human rights grounds only and the fact that the  decision  of
    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davey  does  not  show  that  he  had  been
    involved in any partial re-making of the appeal,  I  concluded  that  I
    could proceed to hear and  re-make  the  decision.   In  reaching  that
    conclusion I took into consideration that neither the appellant nor  Mr
    Harrison objected to that course.

 7. A further matter arose at the commencement of the  hearing  before  me.
    On 8th July 2016 the sponsor wrote to the Upper Tribunal to state  that
    he wished to be represented in court by his  brother-in-law  who  would
    speak on his behalf and  provide  his  evidence.   The  Upper  Tribunal
    responded to the appellant's request by  indicating  that  this  matter
    would be decided by the judge at the hearing.  In  order  to  reach  my
    conclusions on this matter, I ascertained that the sponsor's brother-in-
    law was not to give evidence as  a  witness  but  wished  to  submit  a
    skeleton argument and to assist the sponsor to present the  appellants'
    case.  Mr Harrison did not object to the brother-in-law acting in  that
    capacity.  I decided to allow the brother-in-law to assist the sponsor,
    in particular, to make submissions  on  behalf  of  the  appellant.  In
    reaching that conclusion  I  had  regard  to  paragraph  11(5)  of  the
    Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)   Rules   2008   (as   amended).
    Nevertheless, at a point in the sponsor giving evidence, the brother-in-
    law attempted to prompt him and I  explained  to  the  latter  that  he
    should not do so.  No further difficulties occurred.

The Evidence

 8. Before the sponsor gave evidence his brother-in-law indicated that  the
    sponsor's second child (not an appellant in these proceedings) had been
    born in Pakistan  after  the  sponsor  had  been  naturalised  on  18th
    February 2014 and an application had been made for a  UK  passport  for
    that child.  However, a DNA test had  been  requested  to  confirm  the
    parentage of the second child and I was provided with a  copy  of  that
    document.  The DNA test  had  been  carried  out  by  AlphaBiolabs  and
    concluded that there was a 99.99 percent of ability  of  the  appellant
    and sponsor being the true biological mother and father of  the  second
    child.  Mr Harrison confirmed that AlphaBiolabs were approved as a  DNA
    tester.

 9. The sponsor confirmed that he lives at the stated address in  Stoke-on-
    Trent.  It is his cousin's house and has three  bedrooms.   His  cousin
    has agreed to his,  the  sponsor's,  family  living  there.   This  was
    confirmed in a statement handed to the  Entry  Clearance  Officer.   He
    asserted that he had made regular return visits to Pakistan to see  his
    wife and children.  He last went in November 2015 and, before that,  in
    September 2014.  He claimed to have returned  to  Pakistan  about  once
    every year since coming to the United Kingdom in 2003.  He  married  in
    March 2013 in Pakistan and the second appellant and  his  latest  child
    are both children of the marriage.  He intimated that if his appeal now
    failed, he and his wife would make a further application.   He  claimed
    to have sufficient funds to support his family but agreed that  he  had
    not made a fresh application because he wanted to know the  results  of
    this appeal.

10. During cross-examination the sponsor agreed that when  he  had  married
    his wife in 2013 it was always his intention for her  to  come  to  the
    United Kingdom.  His attention was drawn to the assertion, in paragraph
    3 of the original skeleton argument, in which it was  stated  that  the
    appellant had not realised that the wages from the month of  July  were
    not reflected in bank statements for 2014.  He added  that  if  he  had
    been asked  for  the  statements  he  would  have  provided  them.   He
    indicated that, when visiting Pakistan, he  had  stayed  in  the  house
    belonging to his father which was now maintained by him and his brother
    and paid for by them.  His mother, father, sister and brother  as  well
    as his wife live there.  He indicated that his wife does  not  work  in
    Pakistan although she does have a Master's  degree  in  economics.   He
    pointed out that she had worked as an assistant lecturer in  a  college
    and speaks English.  She holds an  English  language  test  certificate
    (ELTS).  Her family live about one and a half hour's  drive  away  from
    the present home.  The sponsor also indicated  that  he  sends  between
    �300 and �400 per month to his father for  the  benefit  of  the  whole
    family and the maintenance  of  the  house.   He  said  he  would  only
    continue to send money, if his wife came to the United Kingdom,  if  it
    was needed.  He confirmed that neither his wife nor his  children  have
    any health problems.  He stated that, if the present appeal  fails,  he
    would be obliged to send his daughter to school in Pakistan.

11. In response to questions from me, the sponsor confirmed  that  some  of
    the money he sent was  for  the  benefit  of  the  whole  household  in
    Pakistan.

Submissions

12. Mr Harrison agreed  that  the  situation  may  be  different  from  the
    original application because the second child of the  relationship  was
    born after the sponsor had become a British citizen  on  14th  February
    2014.  However,  he  emphasised  that  Article  8  was  being  used  to
    circumvent the Rules because the situation could have been rectified by
    a fresh application.  He  questioned  whether  there  were  exceptional
    circumstances which warranted a  grant  of  leave.   The  parties  were
    married when living in different  countries  with,  now,  two  children
    living in Pakistan.  The status quo can continue until the  application
    is made.

13. The sponsor's brother-in-law drew my attention to the  latest  skeleton
    argument commencing on page 7 of the  original  hearing  bundle.   This
    emphasises  that  the  sponsor's  income  from  employment  and   self-
    employment totals �24,610.60 per  year  as  shown  in  form  SA302  tax
    calculations for the year 2013 to 2014.  The skeleton asserts that  the
    appellant continues to satisfy the financial requirements  of  Appendix
    FM and the Entry Clearance Manager should have taken into  account  the
    "review" letter sent on 24th December 2014 (page 180 of the bundle), to
    which was attached  the  documents  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  had
    claimed in his refusal decision were missing from the application.   If
    they had been taken into consideration by the Entry  Clearance  Manager
    then the extra cost of going to appeal would have been avoided.  It  is
    also contended that the Entry Clearance Officer should have  given  the
    sponsor  the  opportunity  to  submit  further  documents.    In   oral
    submissions  the  brother-in-law  indicated  that   he   believed   the
    respondent's documentary policy, set out in paragraph D of Appendix FM-
    SE, should have been applied.  He emphasised that a  fresh  application
    would now cost the appellants �4,000.

14. As to human rights under Article 8, the sponsor  and  appellant  relied
    upon the original skeleton emphasising the ability of  the  parties  to
    meet the financial  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   It  is
    stated, in the skeleton, that  it  is  not  reasonable  to  expect  the
    appellant to live in Pakistan alone with her daughter and the new child
    without the support of a male figure.   The  parties  wished  to  raise
    their children in the United Kingdom as Pakistan  is  an  insecure  and
    dangerous environment in which to raise  children.   It  is  emphasised
    that the second child (at the date of the original skeleton this  child
    was unborn) would be a British citizen which is a significant factor to
    be taken into consideration.

Conclusions and Reasons

15. This appeal is re-made on human rights grounds only although I comment,
    below, on the submissions made in respect of the ability of the parties
    to meet the financial  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    standard of proof to be applied is the civil standard of a  balance  of
    probabilities and the burden of proof  is  on  the  appellant.   In  AS
    (Somalia) [2009] UKHL 32 the House of Lords decided that the  operative
    date for consideration of evidence supporting a human rights  claim  in
    entry clearance cases is the date of decision.

16. When finding an error of law in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision,
    Deputy Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Davey  made  it  clear  that  subsequent
    information provided for the Entry Clearance Manager's review  did  not
    remedy the defects in the original application which  resulted  in  the
    refusal.  He considered that the Entry Clearance Manager's  review  was
    not judiciable and I agree.  The fact is the original  application  for
    entry  clearance  was  significantly  lacking  in   the   documentation
    specified in Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules,  particularly  in
    relation to the required business bank  account  information,  personal
    bank  statements  and  business  accounts.   Further,  bank   statement
    information submitted did not cover the relevant  full  financial  year
    for self-employment.  These omissions did not attract  the  documentary
    evidence provisions set out in paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE as some of
    the documents submitted were wrong in themselves, showing an income  of
    substantially less than the amount required.   The  application  failed
    because it did not meet the specific requirements of the Rules.  If  it
    is believed that the correct documentation can  now  be  provided,  the
    remedy is for a fresh application to be made. In  paragraph  55  of  SS
    (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 the court of  appeal  made  it  clear  that
    "near miss" cases in relation to satisfying the provisions of the rules
    will by no means show that compelling circumstances exist requiring the
    grant of leave outside the Rules.

17. My approach to the Article 8 claim is guided by the conclusions of  the
    Court of Appeal in SS (Congo) to which I have already referred.  It  is
    to identify compelling circumstances applying in the  circumstances  of
    the case to justify a grant of leave to enter when  the  provisions  of
    the Rules are not complied with.  The court also went  on  to  indicate
    that  a  case  which  involves  a  "near-miss"  in  relation   to   the
    requirements set  out  in  the  Rules,  is  wholly  irrelevant  to  the
    balancing exercise required under Article 8 save that it  may  tip  the
    balance where there  is  a  strong  Article  8  claim  that  compelling
    circumstances may exist to justify  the  grant  of  leave  outside  the
    Rules.

18. It appears to me that there is little in this case which points to  the
    existence of compelling or exceptional circumstances justifying a grant
    of leave.  The sponsor came to the United Kingdom to work  without  his
    family and the parties married in  circumstances  where  it  was  clear
    there was no automatic right to the parties enjoying family life in UK.
     Further, the circumstances of the sponsor's family in Pakistan do  not
    suggest that there  are  any  compelling  circumstances  requiring  the
    family to live together in UK.   The  sponsor's  family  home  provides
    accommodation for  the  appellant  and  her  two  children  with  other
    relatives' in-law including the sponsor's parents.  They benefit from a
    significant allowance from the sponsor of between  �400  and  �500  per
    month to enable them to enjoy a standard of living which may not be  at
    the level available in the United Kingdom but has not given  any  cause
    for concern nor are there any health issues  with  any  family  member.
    This is not the situation of a lone  female  bringing  up  children  in
    inhospitable circumstances.

19. Whilst I accept that the  parties  now  have  a  second  child  who  is
    entitled to British nationality, the  best  interests  of  that  child,
    certainly for the time being, are to remain in the status quo.  But, in
    any event, the birth of that child (due in July 2015) is an event which
    post-dates the refusal decision so is not  materially  relevant  to  my
    considerations.

20. A significant feature of this appeal is that the sponsor maintains that
    his wife should have been granted  entry  clearance  with  their  first
    child because he was capable of meeting the financial provisions of the
    Rules.  If that remains the case  then  there  is  no  reason  why  the
    separation of the parties should be  anything  other  than  short-lived
    because a successful  application  for  entry  clearance  can  be  made
    immediately.   The  fact  that  such  an  application  may,  now,  cost
    significantly more than the original application is not, I conclude,  a
    matter which can be identified as an exceptional circumstance.  If  the
    correct application had been made in the first place  this  eventuality
    could have been avoided and Article 8 is not a means to circumvent  the
    provisions of the Rules.

21.  If  I  am  wrong  in  my  conclusion  that  there  are  no  compelling
    circumstances in this  case  to  justify  consideration  of  Article  8
    outside the Rules, I have applied the same  circumstances  to  which  I
    have  referred  to  the  Razgar  five  stage  tests  and  taking   into
    consideration the best interests of  the  second  appellant.   But  the
    results of  that  analysis  are  the  same.   Whilst  the  respondent's
    decision may  be  an  interference  with  Article  8  rights  and  that
    interference might be seen as having consequences of such gravity as to
    potentially to engage the operation  of  Article  8,  I  am  unable  to
    conclude that interference is proportionate to  the  legitimate  public
    end sought to be achieved.

22. Applying the provisions of Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended) and the fact that the parties might be
    able to show that, in the United Kingdom,  they  would  be  financially
    independent and the sponsor is able to speak English, those matters  do
    not confer a  benefit  when  making  the  proportionality  decision  AM
    (section 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC).   As  I  have  previously
    indicated, the appellant and her family have  claimed  the  ability  to
    meet the requirements of the Rules and so, on that basis, would be able
    to make a fresh application which can lead to entry  clearance  and  an
    enhancement of the Article 8 family life which they currently enjoy.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error  on  a  point  of
law such that it should be re-made on human rights grounds only.  I  re-make
the appeal on that basis and dismiss it on human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I refer to the anonymity direction made at the beginning of  this  decision.
