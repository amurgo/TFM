                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of DRC (with a disputed  date  of  birth  of
    10th March 1995). She arrived in the United  Kingdom  on  20th  January
    2012 and claimed asylum on 6th March 2012, on the basis of her  imputed
    political opinion in the DRC.

 2. The factual basis of the Appellant's claim is as follows:

         "She was brought up by her uncle, Thomas Luwawa, from  the  age  of
         three years. She lived with him, his wife, and his three  daughters
         in Kinshasa. Her uncle was a politician, who was a  member  of  the
         UDPS. Other than this, she knew little of his work because he never
         discussed it. He would sometimes disappear and  the  appellant  and
         his three daughters would be kept off school for a month. He  never
         discussed the reasons  for  his  disappearances  although,  on  one
         occasions,  one  of  his  daughters  told  her  that  he  had  been
         kidnapped.

         At around 4 am on a day in November  2011,  four  men  entered  the
         house where the appellant was  living  and  demanded  to  know  the
         whereabouts of her uncle. Her aunt told them that he was travelling
         away. The men left, only to return a few weeks later  at  the  same
         time of the  morning.  This  time  the  men  searched  her  uncle's
         bedroom. They told her aunt that if they did  not  find  her  uncle
         they would kill his family. Her aunt later told the appellant  that
         she had telephoned  her  uncle  in  order  to  tell  him  what  had
         happened, and that he had said the matter should be reported to the
         police. Her aunt did so, but the police simply said that she should
         report the matter if it happened again.

         At the end of December 2011, the men returned for a third  time  in
         the early hours of the morning. This time they broke down the  door
         and beat her aunt, causing a cut to her face and a  fractured  arm.
         Again, they threatened to kill the family if they did not find  her
         uncle upon their return. The next day, the family went to the house
         of her uncle's friend in Barumbu. Upon  returning  to  Kinshasa  to
         collect some of their belongings from their house in Kinshasa,  her
         aunt was warned by neighbours that the men had returned during  the
         family's absence and advised her to stay away.

         The appellant's uncle returned from Paris on the 17th January  2012
         and arranged for the family to stay  with  his  friend,  Alain,  in
         Brazzaville. On the 19th January  2012,  the  appellant  flew  with
         Alain to the United Kingdom via Paris, in order to  stay  with  her
         sister Mireille, who is a British citizen and lives in London.  Her
         uncle advised her that his wold  (sic)  be  the  safest  course  of
         action in the circumstances".

 3. The Respondent refused  her  claim  and  the  Appellant  appealed  that
    refusal. The appeal came before Judge  Kelly  who  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 19th November 2012, dismissed the appeal on  asylum  and
    human rights grounds. At the  hearing  before  Judge  Kelly  two  other
    matters apart from the  Appellant's  core  asylum  claim  were  raised.
    Firstly there was an  age  dispute.  The  Appellant  claimed  that  her
    correct age is 10th March 1995 whereas the  Respondent  considered  her
    notional age to be 1st January 1994.

 4.  The  second  matter  is  that  the  Appellant  had  formed  a   sexual
    relationship with man in Brixton called Ladis Kayembe who is a  British
    citizen. A child was subsequently born on 20th November  2012  and  has
    been registered as a British citizen.

 5. Judge Kelly noted on the age dispute that there was no Merton compliant
    age assessment to assist him. Nevertheless he concluded  the  Appellant
    fell to be treated as an adult. Reviewing the evidence  before  him  he
    came to the conclusion that the Appellant could safely  return  to  the
    DRC, even as a young single mother with a newborn baby to care for.

 6. In granting permission to appeal Judge Easterman said:

         "The grounds seek  to  argue  that  the  Judge  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal has erred in his findings in relation to  the  applicant's
         age. In the case where the respondent had  no  age  assessment  but
         asserted the applicant was  born  on  1st  January  1994.(sic)  The
         applicant asserted she was born 10th March 1995. Having  found  the
         Respondent had lost the original birth certificate sent to them  by
         the solicitors and found applicant(sic) to be honest  and  possibly
         to believe she was born on 10th March 1995, the  Judge  nonetheless
         concluded she was not a child because she was obviously pregnant.

         It is arguable that  the  question  of  the  applicant's  age  when
         considering return to a country such as the D.R.C goes to  risk  on
         return and reasonableness of relocation and as a  result  would  be
         determined at the lower standard of proof. It is unclear to me,  if
         that is correct, given what the Judge appears to  accept,  on  what
         basis he finds in favour of the Respondent on the question of  age.
         It is also unclear what relevant the applicant's pregnancy had when
         it was not being suggested that  there  was  more  than  16  months
         difference   between   the    Respondent's    position    on    the
         applicant's(sic) with the applicant claiming to be about  17ï¿½.  The
         consideration of the applicant's age, in my view gives rise  to  an
         article law"(sic).

Upper Tribunal Hearing

 7. The matter came before Upper Tribunal Judge Reeds on 1st  August  2013.
    In a decision issued on 14th August 2013 Judge  Reeds  found  that  the
    decision of Judge Kelly contained an error of law, such that it had  to
    be set aside. In her  decision  Judge  Reeds,  after  setting  out  the
    history and factual background to the Appellant's case said,

         "The matter was listed before the Upper Tribunal in accordance with
         the directions given. The Appellant was represented by  Ms  Khan  ,
         who  appeared  for  the  Appellant  in  the  court  below  and  the
         Respondent by Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer. At
         the hearing, Mr Diwnycz having discussed the matter  with  Ms  Khan
         prior to the  hearing  commencing,  informed  the  court  that  the
         Secretary of State conceded that the  decision  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal did disclose an error of law for the reasons  set  out  in
         the grounds and the grant of permission to appeal and that in those
         circumstances, the appropriate course was for the decision  of  the
         First-tier Tribunal to be set aside".

         In the light of the concession made before me there is no basis  on
         which I could possibly do otherwise than to accept that  concession
         and find that the determination cannot stand as a  consequence  .It
         is therefore common ground that the judge made an error of law  and
         that the Tribunal must substitute a  fresh  decision  to  allow  or
         dismiss the appeal.................In the determination it is clear
         that he (Judge Kelly)assessed the risk to the Appellant  on  return
         on the basis that her account of events that caused  her  to  leave
         were true.

         It is clear from the  submissions  of  both  advocates....that  the
         judge erred in law in his approach to the evidence  concerning  the
         central issue of the Appellants age and whether she was a minor and
         it is accepted that this was such as to undermine the  findings  of
         fact as a whole when assessing risk on return.....

         It was agreed by  both  advocates  that  the  positive  credibility
         findings made by the judge concerning the events in  DRC  were  not
         infected by the error of law and therefore should be preserved

         Directions were issued for a resumed hearing  at  Bradford  on  5th
         December 2013. Thus the matter came before me.

The Resumed Hearing

 8. I heard submissions from both representatives. In the event it was  not
    necessary  to  hear  oral  evidence  from  the  Appellant.  Ms   Khan's
    submissions comprised two strands,

      i) The Appellant's age dispute;

     ii) Risk on return/unsafe return.

    She made submissions  following  the  lines  of  her  helpful  skeleton
    argument. It is correct to say that those submissions focussed  in  the
    main on the risk on return  to  the  Appellant,  rather  than  the  age
    dispute. She submitted that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  not
    looked at what would happen to  this  Appellant  at  N'd'jili  Airport,
    should she be returned to DRC. That  had  to  be  factored  in  to  the
    question of risk on return. Once that was factored into  the  preserved
    positive credibility findings of Judge  Kelly,  it  followed  that  the
    Appellant was at real risk on return as recognised by the  Tribunal  in
    the Country Guidance case of BK (failed asylum seekers) DRC  CG  [2007]
    UKAIT 00098.

 9. Mr Diwnycz on behalf of the Respondent, with his customary fairness did
    not seek to press any further points or dissuade me from  accepting  Ms
    Khan's submissions. He pointed out that in any event the Respondent had
    conceded the Appellant's Article 8 claim since it is  accepted  she  is
    now the mother of a British child.

My Findings and Reasons

10.  My starting point in this appeal must  be  the  preserved  credibility
    findings of Judge Kelly. In paragraph 26  the  Judge  agrees  with  the
    Appellant's factual account which forms the basis of her claim. He says
    in paragraph 26 "I therefore assess the risk to the Appellant on return
    to the DRC on the basis that her account of the events that caused  her
    to leave it, are true". He then outlines that account and adds to it in
    paragraph 27. I paragraph 28 he finds,

         "So far as risk of harm from her uncle's foes is concerned, I  find
         that the appellant could safely reside  anywhere  within  the  DRC,
         provided (Judge Kelly's emphasis) that it is not a place  at  which
         her uncle is residing simultaneously".

    The accepted basis of the Appellant's claim is therefore that she is at
    risk in her home area because  of  her  uncle's  involvement  in  UDPS.
    Therefore what would be her position on return to the DRC via  N'd'jili
    Airport.

11. It is clear that Judge Kelly accepted that the  Appellant's  uncle  was
    involved with UDPS. The Appellant had to leave the DRC because of this.
    It is accepted that the authorities came on  three  separate  occasions
    searching for her uncle and therefore it follows that the Appellant  is
    someone who falls into the risk category of having a political profile.
    If the Appellant were to be returned I am satisfied  she  would  be  an
    involuntary returnee. She would face  questioning  at  the  airport  to
    ascertain anything of interest  to  the  authorities,  about  her.  She
    clearly has a higher profile than those who come within the category of
    being simply failed asylum seekers. There is a reasonable likelihood in
    this Appellant's case that because of her background  relating  to  her
    uncle, she would be at risk of being of interest to the authorities and
    would be liable to further questioning  and  transfer  to  a  detention
    facility.

12. Once in detention the Appellant would be at real risk of ill treatment.
    She would be accompanied by her young child and that would increase her
    vulnerability. I am reinforced in this view by BK where it was found,

         "........the preponderance of the evidence, at least  as  presented
         to  us  in  this  appeal  and  (with  express  concession  by  Miss
         Giovannetti for  the  purposes  of  this  appeal)is  that  once  in
         detention away from the airport,  they  will  be  in  an  extremely
         vulnerable situation characterised by physical and verbal abuse  of
         a serious kind. They are no longer involved in a process which  can
         normally be negotiated by paying a bribe in circumstances which are
         not oppressive. They have lost their liberty and face targeted ill-
         treatment".

    I  am satisfied therefore having regard to the  preserved  findings  of
    Judge Kelly and the background documents that removing  this  appellant
    would be contrary to the United Kingdom's obligations  under  the  1951
    Refugee Convention on account of her imputed political opinion.

13. That is sufficient to dispose of this matter. In the  circumstances  it
    is not necessary to make a finding on the age dispute nor  to  consider
    further the question of internal relocation.

DECISION

14. The First-tier Tribunal erred in law. I set  aside  that  decision  and
    remake it. This
         appeal is allowed.

No order for anonymity was sought and therefore none was made.
