For the Respondent:   Mr E Tufan (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1. The Appellant is a citizen of Venezuela, in August 2010 he came to the
   UK as a fianc� with a visa in that capacity. He married his fianc� and in
   due course was granted discretionary leave to remain as a spouse until
   the 27th of May 2014. The marriage did not last and he informed the Home
   Office in May 2013 leading to his leave being curtailed on the 22nd of
   July 2013. The Appellant seeks to remain in the UK on the basis of his
   relationship with his now civil partner, they have lived together since
   December 2012 and entered the civil partnership on the 18th of July 2013
   following the grant of the decree absolute.


2. The Appellant appealed the decision to curtail his leave and remove him
   by Notice and Grounds of Appeal of the 7th of August 2013. The appeal was
   heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Iqbal at Hatton Cross on the 30th of
   May 2014. In a decision promulgated on the 3rd of July 2014 the
   Appellant's appeal was allowed under article 8. The Secretary of State
   sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal in grounds of the 9th
   of July 2014 and permission was granted on the 2nd of September 2014.

3. In paragraph 12 the Judge noted that the appeal was being pursued on the
   basis that the decision breached the Appellant's article 8 rights. It had
   been highlighted that as the Appellant had entered a civil partnership he
   was in a position to make an application under the Immigration Rules but
   the parties wished for the matter to be dealt with under article 8. In
   paragraph 14 she noted that it was conceded that the Appellant could not
   succeed under the Immigration Rules but it was not stated in what way the
   rules were not met. Relevant parts of the head note in Gulshan (Article 8
   - new rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) were included in
   paragraph 16 and in paragraph 17 it was found that there were arguable
   grounds for granting leave outside the rules. For the reasons given in
   paragraphs 18 to 25 the appeal was allowed.

4. The Secretary of State complained that the Immigration Rules had been
   applied to the Appellant's case as they would to any other and that the
   Appellant had not been prejudiced by this. The Appellant could only
   succeed outside the rules if the outcome would be unjustifiably harsh.
   There had been no analysis why the Appellant could not return to
   Venezuela and make an application from there, the Secretary of State was
   entitled to set requirements for those wishing to exercise family life in
   the UK and that included the financial ability to support themselves and
   it was not unjustifiably harsh for the Appellant to return and to make
   the appropriate application. It was further submitted that the Judge had
   not properly considered the situation the Appellant would face in
   Venezuela and the temporary nature of the separation if an application
   were made.

5. In granting permission Judge Holmes noted that the First-tier Tribunal
   Judge had not identified the manner in which the Immigration Rules had
   not been met, had arguably failed to have adequate regard to the public
   interest or the proper approach to proportionality in the light of the
   Court of Appeal decision in MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ 985.

6. Article 8 is not a by-pass to the Immigration Rules and there is plenty
   of authority that the cases that succeed under article 8 but not the
   rules are likely to be small and the circumstances required to do so are
   exceptional in a legal sense. The rules remain the background against
   which the circumstances are to be assessed, for example the maintenance
   requirements remain significant. Also the fact that a person will not
   meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules does not enhance their
   claim under article 8, Ekinci. There is also a clear difference between
   failing to meet the requirements of the rules and being in a situation
   not contemplated by the rules.

7. Also relevant in this context is the case of Chen (Appendix FM -
   Chikwamba - temporary separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189
   (IAC). From that decision it is clear that it is for an appellant to show
   that temporary separation will interfere disproportionately with
   protected rights.

8. Having entered the UK as a fianc� and subsequently marrying his wife the
   Appellant was clearly aware of the requirements of the Immigration Rules,
   the need to make an application and how to do so. He might not have been
   fully aware of the rules as the precise requirements change from time to
   time but he had a familiarity with the rules which would have assisted
   him in addressing his situation.

9. In the legal framework that applied it was not sufficient for the Judge
   simply to state that the Appellant could not meet the Immigration Rules.
   The rules form the background to an article 8 assessment outside the
   rules, if that stage is reached, and so a failure to meet a particular
   requirement may have a particular bearing on the assessment of
   proportionality and the public interest. How an appellant does not meet
   the rules should be stated.

10. As the Judge noted in paragraph 16 of the decision, quoting from
   Gulshan (Article 8 - new rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640, "
   after applying the requirements of the Rules, only if there may arguably
   be good grounds for granting leave to remain outside the rules is it
   necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether there are
   compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them:" In
   short the Judge did not apply the requirements of the rules or identify
   the compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised. In those
   circumstances the decision contained a clear error, the decision is set
   aside and remade.

11. It may well be that an application made by the Appellant in the proper
   way would now meet the substantive requirements of the Immigration Rules.
   However, one of the purposes of the requirement that in the Appellant's
   situation he should make his application from abroad is to prevent
   individuals from entering the UK on one basis and then seeking to switch
   and avoiding the scrutiny of an ECO or seeking to evade one or some of
   the substantive requirements.

12. For the Appellant it was argued that the Appellant did not need to make
   a valid application as the circumstances were caught by paragraph
   GEN1.9(a)(iii) as the article 8 claim was raised in an appeal. This is
   set out more fully in the Appellant's skeleton argument. However it was
   accepted that ultimately the Appellant would also have to meet the
   requirements of paragraph EX1.

13. The Home Office disputed that the Appellant was exempted from the need
   to make an application but contended in any event that the Appellant
   could not meet the requirements of paragraph EX1 and would fail on that
   basis.

14. As the Appellant had not raised the article 8 issue in an application
   but in the context of his appealing the Secretary of State's decision to
   curtail his leave I find that he met the requirements of GEN1.9(a)(iii)
   as the claim was raised in an appeal.

15. Given the accepted background the question that has to be answered to
   dispose of this appeal is whether there are insurmountable obstacles to
   family life with his partner continuing outside the UK. Insurmountable
   obstacles are defined in paragraph EX2 as "very significant difficulties
   which would be faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing
   their family life together outside the UK and which could not be overcome
   or would entail very serious hardship for the applicant or their
   partner."

16. For the Appellant reliance is placed on the discriminatory nature of
   Venezuelan society and the unpleasant environment in which the Appellant
   and his partner would have to live. They both work for American Express,
   employment which would not open to them as that company has no presence
   in Venezuela. If the Appellant were to leave the UK he would lose his job
   here, their flat would have to be surrendered as his partner could not
   afford the rent.

17. For the Home Office it was submitted that the Appellant does not meet
   the requirements of EX1. It was accepted that there is discrimination but
   that is a fact of life and it does not amount to persecution. The
   evidence did not show that family life could not continue there and
   isolated attacks could take place in the UK. It was submitted that there
   were no compelling circumstances to justify consideration of the case
   outside the rules. In any event the Home Office relied on evidence that
   showed that all settlement visas submitted in Caracas were dealt with in
   60 days which was reasonable, 85% were considered within 30 days.

18. The situation the Appellant is in is of his own making. It is to his
   credit that he informed the Secretary of State of the breakdown of his
   marriage, thereby bringing about the curtailment of his leave, but he was
   aware of the need to regularise his position in relation to his new
   domestic circumstances and was aware of the rules that would apply.

19. There is nothing inherently unusual in the Appellant's circumstances.
   Whilst there may be difficulties in his returning to Venezuela to make an
   application in the required manner the evidence does not show that the
   discrimination is such that he could not be expected to do so or, if
   joined by his partner, they would not be able to live together there.
   There may be issues surrounding employment but that would apply to many
   people leaving the UK to live elsewhere, not just Venezuela.

20. There is nothing from the Appellant's employer to show that he would
   inevitably lose his job or that it would not be held open for him to
   return in the timescale indicated in the evidence relating to visa
   processing times. The period in which the Appellant and his partner would
   endure a limited income would itself be limited. These matters have come
   about, by changes brought about by changes in the Appellant's
   circumstances and not by decisions of the Secretary of State.

21. In the circumstances I am not satisfied that the Appellant has shown
   that the situation meets the terms of paragraph EX.1. There are no
   insurmountable obstacles as legally defined, there may be difficulties
   but to say that they would be very significant would not be justified by
   the evidence and accordingly under that part of the rules the appeal
   cannot succeed.

22. Having regard to the case of Chen I do not see how a separation of 2
   months indicated in the evidence could be said to be a disproportionate
   interference with the Appellant's family life with his partner. By
   section 117 B(1) the maintenance of effective immigration control is in
   the public interest and the Appellant has not shown that his
   circumstances are such that the public interest is outweighed. I find
   that the requirement that the Appellant return to Venezuela to make his
   application, supported by the relevant specified evidence, is
   proportionate and not in breach of article 8.

23. There is a residual area where, although there are no insurmountable
   obstacles, it is appropriate to consider an appeal under article 8
   outside the Immigration Rules where there are compelling circumstances.
   Given the facts of this case I am satisfied that there are no compelling
   circumstances that take this case into the area where there could be said
   to be circumstances not adequately recognised by the rules. The Appellant
   has moved from one relationship to another and needs to regularise his
   position, there is nothing unusual in that and inevitably changes of that
   sort bring dislocation which the Appellant and his partner have
   experienced. However, the Appellant cannot point to any facts that make
   his situation an unusual example of its type and I find that there is no
   justification for considering this appeal outside the Immigration Rules
   under article 8.

24. In summary the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred and the decision is set
   aside. The appeal is remade and I find that it is proportionate and
   reasonable to expect the Appellant to return to Venezuela to make an
   application for entry as a partner in the usual way. The time that it
   will take to process such an application, at most 2 months, is not such
   that it could be said to be disproportionate. It is something the
   Appellant could have done some time ago. There is nothing in his
   situation which would justify consideration outside the Immigration
   Rules.

CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making
of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I re-make the decision in the appeal dismissing the appeal of Jesus Esteban
Bellorin Serrano

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I make no
order.

Fee Award

In dismissing this I make no fee award.

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal (IAC)
