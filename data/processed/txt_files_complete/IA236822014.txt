Representation:
Appellant   Miss Fijiwala (Home Office Presenting Officer)
Respondent  Miss Bexson, Counsel, instructed by Adam Bernard Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom as a student in  January  2007
    and was granted leave to remain  until  2011.  On  March  16,  2011  he
    married Sofia Iqbal and  was  subsequently  granted  limited  leave  to
    remain as a spouse until March  26,  2014.  The  parties  separated  in
    November 2012 but shortly before he submitted his  current  application
    on  March  19,  2014  the  appellant  and   her   were   attempting   a
    reconciliation.

 3. On March 19, 2014 the appellant  applied  for  leave  to  remain  under
    Section R-LTRP of Appendix FM as Sofia's partner because they  intended
    to resolve their difficulties.

 4. The respondent refused this application on May 23, 2014 and at the same
    time took a decision to remove him under Section 47 of the Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 1986.

 5. The appellant lodged an appeal under Section 82(1) of the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on June 2, 2014.

 6.  The  matter  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Blake
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") on February 5, 2015  and  in  a
    decision promulgated on March 5, 2015 he allowed the appeal  under  the
    Article 8 ECHR.

 7. The respondent appealed this decision on March 11, 2015  and  Judge  of
    the First-tier  Tribunal  Page  gave  permission  on  April  28,  2015.
    Permission was given because Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Page
    found it arguable that there was nothing about the appellant's  current
    relationship that permitted the  FtTJ  to  have  considered  the  claim
    outside of the Immigration Rules. In the alternative Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Page found it arguable  that  the  FtTJ  failed  to  have
    regard to the fact the appellant failed to satisfy the requirements for
    either entry clearance or leave to remain and he failed  to  take  into
    account the fact the appellant's  private  and  family  life  had  been
    formed when his immigration status was precarious.

 8. The matter came before me on the  above  date  and  both  parties  were
    represented as set out above. The appellant was in attendance  but  his
    partner was unable to attend as she  was  caring  for  her  mother  who
    suffered from ill-health-evidence of a recent  hospital  discharge  was
    submitted.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction pursuant to
    Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  I
    make no alteration to that order.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

10. Miss Fijiwala relied on the grounds of appeal and  submitted  the  FtTJ
    had materially erred. The appellant had applied on the basis he  wanted
    to remain to effect a reconciliation  with  his  former  wife  who  had
    divorced him 2013 but before the  FtTJ  he  had  argued  he  should  be
    allowed to remain based on his eight month  relationship  with  Lavanya
    Pathmaranjan. The appellant could not satisfy GEN 1.2  of  Appendix  FM
    and consequently he could satisfy the definition of partner as they had
    not lived together for two years and he  had  also  failed  to  produce
    evidence  of  his  divorce  certificate.  Following  the  decisions  of
    Secretary of State for the Home Department v SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ
    387 and R (on the application of Chen) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department (Appendix FM-temporary separation-proportionality)  IJR
    [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC) Miss Fijiwala submitted the FtTJ had  erred  by
    failing to follow the approach set out in those cases. He had failed to
    consider whether the appellant satisfied the Immigration  Rules  either
    on entry clearance or the fact the  appellant  could  not  satisfy  the
    requirements necessary for leave to remain. The FtTJ found  exceptional
    circumstances based on the appellant's  partner's  inability  to  speak
    Urdu, their mixed religions, the appellant's partner's mother  was  ill
    and the fact the appellant helped out in the family business.  None  of
    these amounted to insurmountable  factors  as  defined  in  either  the
    respondent's  IDI's  or  SS  (Congo)  and  Chen.  Even  if  there  were
    exceptional circumstances that merited  consideration  of  the  matters
    outside of the Immigration Rules the FtTJ erred by failing  to  balance
    all of the facts when assessing  proportionality.  In  particular,  the
    FtTJ attached too much weight to the  decisions  of  Chikwamba  v  SSHD
    [2008] UKHL 40 and Hayat (nature of Chikwamba  principle)  [2011]  UKUT
    444 (IAC) when the appellant had  failed  to  satisfy  the  Immigration
    Rules or produce the mandatory documentation requirements  of  Appendix
    FM-SE. The FtTJ failed to have regard, when assessing  proportionality,
    the  fact  the  relationship  had  been  formed  when  the  appellant's
    immigration status was precarious and that he had originally applied to
    remain based on his relationship with his ex-wife and he had failed  to
    disclose his marital breakdown to the respondent until  he  applied  to
    extend his leave.

11. Miss Bexson invited  me  to  uphold  the  decision.  She  accepted  the
    appellant did  not  meet  the  Immigration  Rules  in  respect  of  his
    application to remain and she further accepted the appellant had failed
    to provide any financial evidence  to  demonstrate  his  wife  met  the
    financial requirements for entry clearance but she submitted  the  FtTJ
    had given reasons for finding this was a case that should be considered
    outside of the Rules and he had done this having regard to all  of  the
    circumstances. When assessing proportionality he had regard to  Section
    117B of the 2002 Act and his decision was open to him.

    FINDINGS ON ERROR IN LAW

12. The appellant entered the country as a student in 2007 and his leave to
    remain was extended to enable him  to  continue  his  studies.  Shortly
    before his leave expired he  married  Sofia  in  March  2012  but  this
    marriage was short-lived because  she  left  the  matrimonial  home  in
    November 2012 and the FtTJ was told that she and the appellant divorced
    a year later. With the clock ticking on his leave the appellant  stated
    he wanted to attempt a reconciliation but this failed miserably because
    according to the evidence given to the FtTJ the appellant had  begun  a
    new relationship with Lavanya around June 2014 (eight months  prior  to
    the hearing).

13. When the matter came before the FtTJ the appellant sought to remain  on
    the basis of  that  relationship.  Miss  Bexson,  who  represented  the
    appellant before the FtTJ, quite properly conceded in the  lower  court
    that the appellant could  not  satisfy  Appendix  FM  Section  EX.1  or
    paragraph 276ADE HC 395. Today, she also accepted  that  he  failed  to
    satisfy the Rules relating to entry clearance  and  in  particular  the
    financial requirement and the associated documentary requirements.

14. It is against this background the FtTJ should have  considered  whether
    there were factors that enabled him to consider this  case  outside  of
    the Rules.  At  paragraph  [99]  of  his  determination  he  found  the
    appellant's new circumstances had not been resolved by  the  respondent
    (as they had  never  been  raised)  and  in  particular,  he  felt  the
    appellant's partner's language difficulties, the fact  her  mother  was
    ill and she helped run the family business meant this was a  case  that
    could be dealt with outside of the Rules.

15. I concluded at the end of submissions there had been an  error  in  law
    and I now set out my reasons for that conclusion.

16. Whilst the Immigration Rules are not necessarily a complete  code  they
    are nevertheless an important starting point. The appellant had applied
    for leave to remain under Section R-LTRP of  Appendix  FM.  He  clearly
    could not succeed based on the application he submitted because he  was
    no longer with his ex-wife. That application was doomed to failure  and
    any article 8 argument based on that relationship was similarly doomed.
    He had been given leave to remain to live  with  his  wife  but  within
    eight months of marriage they had separated and according to  him  they
    were divorced twelve months thereafter. In fact, prior to issuing  this
    current application they were divorced and within three months or so of
    submitting the application he had begun a  relationship  with  Lavanya.
    There were therefore no circumstances meriting consideration outside of
    the Rules based on the original facts.

17. The FtTJ quite properly considered  the  appellant's  changed  position
    although in truth the appellant should perhaps have submitted  a  fresh
    application  to  enable  the  respondent  to  properly   consider   the
    application as against the FtTJ being  asked,  at  first  instance,  to
    consider the position.

18. That relationship began when his status was precarious.  Their  private
    life was precarious  as  was  any  family  life  they  struck  up.  The
    appellant knew why he had been allowed to stay so having a relationship
    with another woman outside of that marriage was certainly not something
    covered by any expectation to remain by virtue of his spousal visa. His
    expectation to remain ended in reality in November 2012  when  his  ex-
    wife left the matrimonial home. The appellant was therefore  unable  to
    meet the mandatory requirement of GEN 1.2 that  defines  a  partner  as
    someone living with the appellant for a period of two  years  prior  to
    the date of application. Miss Bexson conceded at the  original  hearing
    this Rule could not be met and by accepting paragraph 276ADE could  not
    be met she had to accept there were no insurmountable obstacles  facing
    the appellant if he were returned.

19. The FtTJ failed to consider any of the entry clearance requirements but
    instead made findings on factors why the appellant's partner could  not
    travel to Pakistan.

20. For the purposes of this assessment I am going to accept the  FtTJ  was
    able to consider the case outside of the Rules but in doing so he still
    had to consider the principles of  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  00027  and  in
    particular proportionality.

21. Any assessment of proportionality  requires  consideration  of  Section
    117B of the 2002 Act and whilst the appellant  spoke  English  and  had
    demonstrated an ability to work they were only some of the  factors  to
    be  considered.  Section  117B(1)  makes  clear  "the  maintenance   of
    effective immigration controls is in the public interest."

22.  The  appellant  failed  to  demonstrate  he  could  meet  any  of  the
    Immigration Rules and there was a total lack of evidence  to  show  his
    new  partner  earned  the  �18,600  required  for  an  entry  clearance
    application. They also failed to produce any of the documents  set  out
    in Appendix FM-SE.

23. Miss Bexson referred me to Chikwamba and Hayat  but  the  principle  of
    Chikwamba was that requiring the appellant to return when  he  met  the
    Rules was disproportionate. In this case the appellant  had  failed  to
    demonstrate he met any of the Rules but the FtTJ gave this no weight to
    this. He also gave no weight to the fact the  relationship  began  when
    his immigration status was precarious. These are significant matters  a
    Tribunal must  consider  when  assessing  proportionality.  The  FtTJ's
    failure to do so amounted to a material error.

24. The Tribunal in SS (Congo)  at  paragraph  [44]  set  out  the  correct
    approach to be taken and at paragraph [33] the Tribunal reiterates that
    very compelling reasons are needed to consider article 8 claims outside
    of the Rules. Even if I accept, for the purpose of this argument,  this
    hurdle was overcome,  the Court in Chen made clear there still  has  to
    be a significant interference.

25. The factors presented on the appellant and his partner's behalf do  not
    amount  to  a  significant  interference  when  balanced  against   the
    importance of the maintenance of  effective  immigration  control.  The
    IDI's make clear that neither an inability to speak  the  language  nor
    the fact one party is a British citizen amounts  to  an  insurmountable
    obstacle.

26. Sales LJ in Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ 440 found there was a  gap  between
    Section EX.1 of Appendix FM and what Article 8 might  require  in  some
    cases. However he went on to say,

         "Thus it is possible that a case might be found to  be  exceptional
         for the purposes of the relevant test under Article 8  in  relation
         to precarious family life even where there  are  no  insurmountable
         obstacles to continuing family life overseas. This means that there
         is a gap between section EX.1 of Appendix FM  and  what  Article  8
         might require in some cases: see Nagre, paras. [41]-[48]. But  this
         does not  mean  that  the  issue  whether  there  are  or  are  not
         insurmountable obstacles to relocation drops  out  of  the  picture
         where there is reliance on Article 8. It is a material factor to be
         taken into account: see Nagre, paras. [41] and [47];  Rodrigues  da
         Silva and Hoogkamer v  Netherlands,  para.  [39];  and  Jeunesse  v
         Netherlands, paras. [107] and  [117].  In  relation  to  precarious
         family life cases, as I observed in Nagre at para.  [43],  the  gap
         between section EX.1 and the requirements of Article 8 is likely to
         be small."

27. There were no insurmountable obstacles as defined by  Section  EX.2  of
    Appendix FM and the FtTJ had to have regard to that fact but this is  a
    precarious family and private life case   because  the  appellant  knew
    what his position was.

28. Sales LJ made clear at paragraph [31] of Agyarko that-

         "It is possible to envisage a Chikwamba type case arising in  which
         Article 8 might require that leave to remain be granted outside the
         Rules,  even  though  it  could  not  be  said  that   there   were
         insurmountable obstacles to  the  applicant  and  their  spouse  or
         partner continuing their  family  life  overseas.  But  in  a  case
         involving  precarious  family  life,  it  would  be  necessary   to
         establish that there were exceptional circumstances to warrant such
         a conclusion"

29. The FtTJ erred in  finding  these  circumstances  exceptional  and  his
    reliance on Chikwamba and the factors contained in paragraphs  [99]  to
    [104] and [121] and [122] had to be weighed against the factors set out
    above and of course the fact the appellant had family he  could  return
    to. There was no suggestion that his family did not accept his  partner
    because she was a Hindu.

30. As regards the appellant's partner's  mother's  ill  health  there  was
    limited evidence submitted. A discharge form was produced but there was
    no evidence of any ongoing treatment. It is a factor I have to consider
    on any proportionality assessment but it it is not a factor that on its
    own trumps all other concerns. Although it was claimed the  appellant's
    partner helped run the family business no  evidence  of  her  level  of
    involvement was adduced and in particular there was no evidence of  any
    income received or accounts. The letter from the accountant  is  wholly
    insufficient.

31. Even if the FtTJ should have considered this claim outside of the Rules
    I am satisfied that in considering stage 5 of Razgar it  would  not  be
    disproportionate to require the appellant to leave the  United  Kingdom
    and my reasosn for this are based on the findings I have made above.

32. In the circumstances, I find the FtTJ erred  in  allowing  this  appeal
    under article 8 ECHR and for the reasons set out above I set aside that
    decision and I dismiss this appeal.

    DECISION

33. There was a material error in law. I set aside the FtTJ's decision  and
    remake the decision. I dismiss the appeal under  both  the  Immigration
    Rules and article 8 ECHR.
