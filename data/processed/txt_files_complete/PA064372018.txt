                                   Between

                                    [A M]
                       (anonymity direction not made)
                                                                   Appellant

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr M Symes of Counsel
For the respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The appellant, a national of Bangladesh born on 10 May 1987,  appeals  to
   the Upper Tribunal against the decision of the respondent  dated  31  May
   2018 refusing his claim for asylum and  humanitarian  protection  in  the
   United Kingdom. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Ms  GA  Black  dismissed  the
   appellant's appeal in a decision promulgated on 25 June 2018.


2. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Landes  in
   a decision dated 10 August 2018 stating that  it  is  arguable  that  the
   Judge did not consider and evaluate the appellant's claim appropriately.


3. At the hearing, Ms Everett stated that the grounds of  appeal  have  been
   made out as the Judge overlooked material evidence. As a  consequence,  I
   do not need to set out the reasons for finding that there is  a  material
   error of law in the decision other than to  say  that  I  agree  with  Ms
   Everett.


4. I therefore set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  and
   remit it to the First-tier Tribunal for findings of fact to be made.  The
   appeal be placed before any Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  other  than
   Judge GA Black.

DECISION

Appeal remitted to the First's-tier Tribunal


Signed                                                                    by
   Dated this 23rd day of October 2018
