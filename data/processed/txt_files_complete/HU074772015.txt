                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Albania born  on  17th  March  1983.  She
    appeals against the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Monson,
    promulgated on 7th November 2016, dismissing her  appeal,  against  the
    refusal to grant leave to remain, under Appendix FM and  on  Article  8
    grounds.

2.   The Appellant appealed on the ground that the judge had  erred  in  law
    in his consideration of EX.1(a) and whether it was reasonable to expect
    the child to leave the UK. The judge  had  wrongly  asked  himself  the
    question of whether it would be reasonable for the child to relocate to
    Albania with both parents. The judge had fallen into error in  stating,
    at paragraph 42, that the best  interests  of  the  child  lie  in  him
    'resettling' in Albania with his parents. The judge failed to refer  to
    the  circumstances  of  the  Appellant's  husband  and  his  length  of
    residence and ties to  the  UK,  and  failed  to  appreciate  that  the
    Appellant's husband was from Prinzen, Kosovo.

3.   Permission was granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Andrew  on  26th
    April 2017 on the grounds that she was satisfied there was an  arguable
    error of law in the decision at paragraph 42. It was arguable that  the
    judge failed to recognise the Appellant's partner was not  of  Albanian
    descent but Kosovan and that he is now a British  citizen.   The  judge
    failed to consider whether the Appellant's partner  could  resettle  in
    Albania. Judge Andrew found no arguable error of  law  in  relation  to
    Article 8.

4.   In the Rule 24 response, the Respondent stated:
    "It is submitted that it is absolutely apparent that the FTIJ  was  not
    operating under a mistake of fact  and  was  completely  aware  of  the
    nationality of the parties and their correct immigration histories.  At
    paragraph 7 the FTIJ sets out the Appellant's evidence that the  father
    is a British citizen and at 23 that he  came  from  an  area  that  was
    called Northern Albania because of the open border. At paragraph 25 the
    FTIJ records that the  father  had  been  to  Albania  many  times.  At
    paragraph 31-34 the FTIJ then considers EX1a, finding at  paragraph  34
    that 'The apprehended difficulties faced by the couple in relocating to
    Albania or Kosovo are economic. They are not  societal,  linguistic  or
    cultural.'  On this basis, the FTIJ finds that EX1b is not made out. It
    is submitted that there is nothing in the circumstances of the  parties
    that evidence that the threshold of insurmountable  obstacles  is  met.
    The Respondent relies upon the Supreme Court  decision  of  Agyarko  in
    this regard.
    It is submitted that the FTIJ's approach to EX1a does not  disclose  an
    arguable error of law. The Appellant conceded at paragraph 36 that  the
    Zambrano principle is not engaged.  The  FTIJ  then  correctly  directs
    himself  in  respect  of  s.  55  jurisprudence  by  reference  to   EV
    Philippines and MA Pakistan. At 42 he then  finds  on  account  of  the
    child's circumstances his best interests are to accompany  his  parents
    to Albania.  The FTIJ carefully points out that  he  has  excluded  the
    wrong doing of his mother  in  the  best  interest  assessment.  It  is
    submitted that the grounds fail to identity anything specifically  said
    by the FTIJ that could be construed  as  erroneous  in  fact  or  legal
    approach."


Submissions

5.   Mr Cisnerus relied on his skeleton  argument  and  submitted  that  the
    judge was confused as to the status of  the  Appellant's  husband.  The
    judge stated that he had returned to Albania many times which  suggests
    that the judge was of the view that he originated  from  Albania.   The
    judge assumed that the Appellant and  her  husband  could  go  back  to
    Albania and the fact that the Appellant's husband was a British citizen
    was  not  sufficiently  taken  into  account.  The  judge  assumed  the
    Appellant's husband could settle in Albania.

6.   The judge failed to  address  whether  the  Appellant's  husband  could
    relocate to Albania. It was for the Respondent to show that  a  British
    citizen could relocate outside the UK. Mr Cisnerus relied on Sanade and
    others (British children - Zambrano - Dereci) [2012] UKUT  00048  (IAC)
    where the Tribunal held at paragraph 95: "Where the child or indeed the
    remaining spouse is a British citizen and therefore a  citizen  of  the
    European Union, it is not possible to require them to relocate  outside
    of the European Union or submit that it would be reasonable for them to
    do so. The case serves  to  emphasise  the  importance  of  nationality
    already  identified  in  the  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  ZH
    (Tanzania).  If interference with family life is to be justified it can
    only be on the basis that the conduct of the person to be removed gives
    rise to considerations of such weight as to justify separation."

7.   Mr Cisnerus submitted that the judge had erred in his consideration  of
    the status of the Appellant's husband in Albania which had affected his
    findings on the best interests of the child. The error was material and
    had affected the judge's assessment of Article 8.

8.   At paragraph 42, the judge was not entitled  to  reach  the  conclusion
    that the Appellant and her husband could resettle in Albania because it
    was based on the assumption that the Appellant could return to  Albania
    with her husband and therefore there were no significant obstacles.

9.   Mr Bramble submitted that the judge was aware  of  the  nationality  of
    the Appellant's husband. At paragraph 3,  the  judge  referred  to  him
    being a national of Kosovo after birth and at paragraph 7 that he was a
    British citizen who was granted refugee status in 2002.   At  paragraph
    23 the judge acknowledged that the  Appellant's  husband  was  born  in
    Prinzen which was in Northern Albania  and  had  an  open  border  with
    Kosovo. At paragraph 25 the  judge  noted  his  ability  to  return  to
    Albania many times in order  to  continue  his  relationship  with  the
    Appellant. The  judge  was  not  confused  as  to  the  status  of  the
    Appellant's husband and the judge did not think that he was an Albanian
    national.

10.  Mr Bramble submitted that  the  judge  considered  EX.1.  as  early  as
    paragraph 31  and  he  dealt  with  very  significant  difficulties  at
    paragraph 32. His conclusion at paragraph 34 that the difficulties were
    economic was open to the judge on the evidence before him. This was the
    starting  point.   Zambrano  was  not  engaged.  There  was   also   an
    alternative argument separating the mother from the child, but that was
    not pursued before the First-tier Tribunal. The judge was not  confused
    as to the nationality of the Appellant's husband. It was  in  the  best
    interests of the child to remain with both parents. The Appellant,  her
    husband and child could relocate to Albania as a  family  unit.   There
    was no error of law in the decision.

11.   In  response,  Mr  Cisnerus  submitted  that  the  judge  should  have
    considered whether it was reasonable for the  Appellant's  husband  and
    child to leave the UK. The judge failed to consider the position of the
    Appellant's husband and child in the UK and had  erred  in  considering
    whether it was reasonable for the child to  go  to  Albania.  This  was
    material following MA Pakistan. Had the judge  considered  the  child's
    British citizenship then resettlement in Albania was  a  finding  which
    was not open to the judge. The judge did not consider whether the child
    as a British citizen should be removed from the UK. The  judge  applied
    the wrong test in EX.1. and what followed made his decision erroneous.


Discussion and Conclusions

12.  I am not persuaded that the judge was confused as to the status of  the
    Appellant's husband or indeed his nationality. The judge is quite clear
    that the Appellant's  husband,  the  child's  father,  originated  from
    Kosovo, that he was born in Prinzen  and  that  this  was  in  Northern
    Albania which had an open border with Kosovo. The judge was also  aware
    that  the  Appellant's  husband  is  now  a  British  citizen  who  had
    previously been granted refugee status in the UK in 2002.

13.  The judge took into account the husband's length of residence and  ties
    to the UK  at  paragraphs  8  and  18.  In  considering  insurmountable
    obstacles he took into account the ability to lawfully enter  and  stay
    in another country, any cultural barriers,  the  impact  of  mental  or
    physical disability and  the  security  situation  in  the  country  of
    return. On the facts, the Appellant's husband had been able to lawfully
    enter Albania on numerous occasions. There were no  cultural  barriers,
    disability or security problems. The judge found that the Appellant had
    her husband  could  relocate  to  Kosovo  or  Albania.  There  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles which would be faced by the Appellant and  her
    husband in continuing their family life outside the UK and which  could
    not be overcome or entail very serious hardship.

14.  The judge found at paragraph 34:  "Although  the  obstacles  to  family
    life being carried on outside the United Kingdom  do  not  have  to  be
    literally insurmountable, the threshold is nonetheless very high, as is
    apparent from the wording of EX.2. The apprehended  difficulties  faced
    by the couple in relocating to Albania or Kosovo  are  economic.   They
    are not societal,  linguistic  or  cultural.   It  is  clear  from  the
    authorities and also from the Home Office guidance that  a  significant
    downgrade in the socio-economic conditions which the couple will  enjoy
    in the country of return is not sufficient to  engage  EX.1.(b)."  This
    finding was open to the judge on the evidence before him.

15.  Mr Cisnerus submitted that the judge was wrong to  consider  relocation
    to Albania. The judge should have considered whether it was  reasonable
    for the Appellant's husband to relocate outside the UK. The  judge  did
    so. At paragraph 34 the judge  considered  whether  family  life  could
    continue outside of the UK and concluded  that  it  could  continue  in
    Albania or Kosovo. There  was  no  error  of  law  in  considering  the
    proposed country of return.

16.  The judge  first  considered  whether  there  would  be  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life  continuing  between  the  Appellant  and  her
    husband outside the UK, namely in relocating to Albania or Kosovo,  and
    having found that there were not, the judge went  on  to  consider  the
    best interests of the child. There was no error of law in  the  judge's
    approach and his findings were open to him on the evidence before him.

17.  It was conceded at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal that  the
    Zambrano principles were not engaged. This was not  a  case  where  the
    child would be compelled to follow his mother to  Albania  because  the
    child's father could look after  him  in  the  UK  in  the  Appellant's
    absence.

18.  The judge found that the British citizenship  of  the  Appellant's  son
    was not determinative of whether it was in his best interests to remain
    in the UK. The question was whether it was reasonable to expect him  to
    leave the UK. The judge properly directed himself in accordance with EV
    Philippines and MA Pakistan. The child was 2 � years old at the date of
    hearing and had not started nursery. Any proposed interference with his
    family life that he had as a British citizen was minimal given his best
    interests were to remain with both parents. The judge  also  took  into
    account section 117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
    2002. He acknowledged that British citizenship  should  be  given  some
    weight leaning in favour of leave to remain being granted.

19.  The judge found at paragraph 42: "Aside from his status  as  a  British
    national, the best interest  considerations  in  favour  of  the  child
    accompanying his parents to Albania are overwhelming, given his age and
    the fact that he has not yet embarked on his primary school  education.
    He has not developed a private life outside the home, so what  is  most
    important for his welfare and wellbeing is that he should  continue  to
    live in the same household as both his parents, wherever that household
    is located. Resettlement  in  Albania  will  mean  that  he  can  enjoy
    prolonged family reunion with relatives on both his father's  side  and
    mother's side, and he will have the benefit of being  immersed  in  the
    social  and  cultural  milieu  from  which  both  his  parents  spring.
    Accordingly, overall his  best  interests  lie  in  him  resettling  in
    Albania with his parents,  given  that  there  are  not  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life  between  his  parents  being  carried  on  in
    Albania.    Moreover,   having   regard   to   wider    proportionality
    considerations, while he is not to blame for the choices  made  by  his
    parents, his mother's adverse immigration history reinforces the public
    interest in requiring the entire family to  resettle  in  Albania,  and
    thus it is reasonable to expect the child to leave the  United  Kingdom
    with his parents.  So EX.1(a) is not made out."

20.  The judge found that the best interests of the  child  were  to  remain
    with both parents; there  were  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  both
    parents  relocating  outside  the  UK;  there  was  evidence  that  the
    Appellant's husband had visited Albania many times and had  carried  on
    his relationship with the Appellant there; and it  was  reasonable  for
    the child to leave the UK and live in Albania  with  his  parents.  The
    judge's findings were open to him on the evidence  before  him  and  he
    gave adequate reasons for his conclusions.

21.  In relation to Article 8 the Appellant had  entered  the  UK  illegally
    and established family life here when she  knew  that  her  status  was
    unlawful. The judge also considered whether the Appellant could  return
    to Albania and obtain entry clearance. He  considered  that  a  British
    citizen child would not be compelled to accompany his  mother,  but  it
    would probably be in his best interests to remain with his mother given
    that she had the day-to-day care of him while his father was  at  work.
    The Appellant's child would be separated from  his  father  whilst  the
    entry clearance application was  pending,  but  it  was  reasonable  to
    expect him to leave the UK for the purposes of seeking entry clearance.



22.  I find that  there  was  no  material  error  of  law  in  the  judge's
    decision.  In summary, he was well-aware that the  Appellant's  husband
    and child were British  citizens.  He  properly  considered  paragraphs
    EX.1(a) and EX.1(b) of the Immigration Rules.  On the  evidence  before
    the judge there were no insurmountable obstacles to the  Appellant  and
    her husband continuing family life outside the UK and, given  that  the
    child was under three years old and had not started  school,  his  best
    interests were to remain within the family unit and return  to  Albania
    with his mother and her husband. Accordingly, I dismiss the Appellant's
    appeal.
