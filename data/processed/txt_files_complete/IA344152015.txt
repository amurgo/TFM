               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                     and

                                 JAVID AQIB
                          (ANONYMITY ORDER NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal of 31 August 2017 to allow the appeal of Aqib
       Javid, a citizen of Pakistan born 29  January  1992,  itself  brought
       against the Home Office decision of 16 November 2015  to  refuse  his
       application for a residence card.


    2. The immigration history supplied  by  the  Respondent  was  that  the
       Appellant entered the UK as a Tier 4 General Student with leave until
       8 August 2012, extended until 29 December 2014, though  it  was  then
       curtailed to expire on 22 August 2013.


    3. The application (made on 30 December 2014) was on the  basis  of  his
       marriage to Ilknur Surer, a German citizen, working in the UK  for  a
       firm called Tasty and Yummy Ltd, based in  Edmonton.   Mr  Javid  had
       married her on 14 April 2014.


    4. The application was refused because the Secretary of State had doubts
       about the genuineness  of  the  relationship,  and  accordingly  sent
       immigration officers to the matrimonial  home's  address.  They  were
       apparently told that Mr Javid lived there alone. He  and  his  spouse
       were invited to attend a marriage interview  on  2  October  2015  to
       explain themselves. They did not  attend  that  interview,  Mr  Javid
       explaining this was due to his involvement in a motor  collision;  he
       provided a letter from the Hillingdon Urgent Care Centre  stating  he
       had attended there. A further interview was scheduled for 5  November
       2015, and again he did not attend. The Secretary of State refused the
       application on the basis that no good reason had been shown  for  the
       non-attendances; on the former occasion, the  medical  note  did  not
       record the severity of his injuries.


    5. Mr Javid requested an oral hearing of his  appeal.  It  came  on  for
       hearing before the First-tier Tribunal on 22 August 2017, and he  did
       not attend; his solicitors informed the Tribunal on  21  August  2017
       that they were ceasing to act as they had received  no  instructions;
       they sent an email on the evening of the same date stating that  they
       had now heard that he wished to seek an adjournment,  though  he  had
       nevertheless ceased to instruct them. No reasons were given for  that
       adjournment application. A person describing themselves as  a  friend
       of Mr Javid provided a note to the Tribunal usher stating that he had
       attended the Ealing Urgent Care Centre on 22 August; his reasons  for
       doing so were not stated.


    6. The First-tier Tribunal noted that Mr Javid's  bundle  of  supporting
       evidence included documents indicating he had been involved  in  road
       traffic accidents on or around 2 October and 30 October 2015,  though
       there was no evidence of  his  hospitalisation  on  either  occasion.
       Nevertheless  there  was  medical   evidence   recording   his   non-
       availability: atat  doctor's "Med 3  Fit  Note"  of  2  October  2015
       stated he was not fit for work due to a soft tissue injury from a car
       accident, and a letter from West Middlesex University Hospital stated
       he attended accident and emergency on 30 October 2015. The appeal had
       previously been listed on 31 January 2017 and  20  February  2017  as
       either Mr Javid or Ms Surer were unwell; on  the  latter  application
       medical evidence had been provided from Ms Surer's German doctor,  on
       the former occasion counsel had attended and given the information in
       question.


    7. The First-tier Tribunal refused to adjourn the appeal for  a  further
       time, on the basis there was no evidence Mr Javid was too  unwell  to
       attend, and concluded he lacked the will or commitment  to  prosecute
       his appeal in a timely fashion;  it  had  now  been  pending  for  18
       months. He had filed a bundle of supporting evidence.


    8. The First-tier Tribunal considered the evidence, noting that Mr Zahid
       Habib, who previously shared the same address, stated he had not told
       the immigration officer who visited that Mr Javid lived there  alone;
       he said he was not asked about the Sponsor at all. Had he been asked,
       he would have confirmed that in reality Mr  Javid  or  Ms  Surer  had
       cohabited  there  since  25  March  2015.  A  significant  volume  of
       documentary evidence was available: a number of  utility  bills  were
       addressed jointly to Mr Javid or Ms Surer, they were  both  named  at
       resident there on the electoral register, and there were letters from
       HMRC to Ms Surer at that address from December 2014 to January  2017,
       as well as her business accounts for the year ending 2016.  A  number
       of photographs  showed  them  together,  and  a  series  of  WhatsApp
       messages between the couple, written in German but whose meaning  was
       self-evident and obviously supportive of their case.


    9. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that the  Secretary  of  State  had
       been justified in raising the issue of marriage of  convenience,  but
       that on balance of probabilities it was nevertheless  satisfied  that
       sufficient  explanation  had  been  provided  to  confirm  that   the
       relationship was a genuine one, and not one entered into in which the
       primary purpose was securing Mr Javid's immigration status.


   10. Grounds of appeal from the Secretary of State argued that Mr  Javid's
       failure to provide  information  regarding  the  genuineness  of  the
       relationship on  five  separate  occasions  would  have  justified  a
       finding that this was a  marriage  of  convenience.  The  letters  of
       support provided should have been  accorded  "very  little,  if  any,
       weight" absent attendance by their authors. It  was  far  from  clear
       that the First-tier Tribunal "has approached the  evidence  with  the
       right degree of caution, given the substantial suspicion that  arises
       from the appellant's actions."


   11. Although the First-tier Tribunal refused permission to appeal,  Judge
       Allen found that the points made in the grounds  were  arguable,  and
       granted permission to appeal on 14 November 2017.


   12. Before me, Mr Tarlow relied on the  grounds  of  appeal,  emphasising
       that the background  to  the  appeal  and  the  Respondent's  limited
       engagement with the process of assessing  whether  his  marriage  was
       genuine  should  have  caused   the   First-tier   Tribunal   to   be
       significantly more sceptical of the case that he put forward. For the
       Respondent, it was submitted that the  fact-finding  was  within  the
       range of reasonable responses to the material put  forward,  and  the
       conclusions below could not be stigmatised as perverse.


Findings and reasons


   13. This is an appeal where the First-tier  Tribunal  gave  a  very  full
       review of  the  evidence  before  it  and  was  fully  aware  of  the
       background to the appeal. It noted that the Respondent had failed  to
       attend interviews twice, but also that there  was  evidence  provided
       justifying his absence. It was also acutely aware that the Respondent
       had not given oral evidence before it.  Generally  speaking,  when  a
       witness's credibility is in dispute, the  absence  of  oral  evidence
       will be to their disadvantage.


   14. However, in an appeal  arising  from  European  Union  free  movement
       rights, the situation is rather different.


   15. Papajorgji [2012] UKUT 00038 (IAC) explains that at the outset of  an
       application, there is no burden on a claimant to demonstrate  that  a
       marriage to an EEA national is not  one  of  convenience:  there  was
       merely an evidential burden  on  the  claimant  to  address  evidence
       justifying reasonable suspicion that the marriage is entered into for
       the  predominant  purpose  of  securing  residence  rights.  At  [27]
       Papajorgji sets out that "there is no burden on the  claimant  in  an
       application for a family permit to establish that she was  not  party
       to a marriage of convenience unless the circumstances  known  to  the
       decision maker give reasonable ground for suspecting  that  this  was
       the case."


   16. In  Rosa [2016] EWCA Civ 14 the Court of Appeal examined the question
       of the  burden  of  proof  in  EEA  marriage  of  convenience  cases,
       upholding the reasoning in  Papajorgi and finding that


   a) The legal burden lies on the Secretary  of  State  to  prove  that  an
      otherwise valid marriage is a marriage of convenience  [24]  -  whilst
      the legal  burden  remains  on  the  national  authorities  throughout
      proceedings, the evidential burden may nevertheless shift [29];


   b) It is for the national court to verify  the  existence  of  any  abuse
      relied upon by the authorities of a Member State,  evidence  of  which
      must be adduced in accordance with rules of national law [26].


   17. Mr Tarlow sought to argue his case by reference to a lack of  reasons
       being given by the Tribunal below for not being more sceptical of the
       Respondent's case. As noted by Beatson LJ in Haleemudeen [2014]  EWCA
       Civ 558 �35, 37:


           "What is required is  that  the  reasons  must  give  sufficient
           detail to  show  the  parties  and  the  appellate  tribunal  or
           reviewing court the principles upon which the lower tribunal has
           acted, and the reasons that led it to its decision, so that they
           are able to understand why it reached its decision. The  reasons
           need not be elaborate, and need not  deal  with  every  argument
           presented ...
           ... judicial restraint should be exercised when the reasons that
           a tribunal gives for its decision  are  being  examined  and  it
           should not be assumed too readily that the tribunal  misdirected
           itself because not every step in its reasoning  is  set  out  in
           it".

   18. The reasoning of the First-tier Tribunal is very clear. The  Tribunal
       was impressed by the weight of documentary evidence  put  forward  by
       the Respondent, which it clearly viewed as of a  volume  and  quality
       that could not seriously have been contrived. The only evidence  upon
       which the Secretary of State relied to discharge the  initial  burden
       of proof on her to put "marriage of  convenience"  in  issue,  was  a
       written attendance note of a  home  visit;  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       found that the concerns therein were answered by a written  statement
       from the very person said to have given the answers  that  originally
       raised concern. It is difficult to  see  any  error  of  law  in  the
       Tribunal preferring one form of written evidence  over  another  when
       neither witness gives oral evidence,  particularly  when  the  losing
       party is the one who bears the burden of proof.


   19.  That  evidence  aside,  there  was  nothing  which  called  for  the
       Respondent to answer the Home Office allegation that his marriage was
       one of convenience, and so  the  failure  to  attend  the  interviews
       rather diminishes in significance, there being no other material that
       put the genuineness of the relationship in  issue  so  as  to  demand
       responses from him. The UK authorities are, after all,  not  entitled
       to investigate the genuineness of  a  relationship  on  a  systematic
       basis, see for example  Gureckis  [2017]  EWHC  3298  (Admin),  which
       stresses that Article 14(2) of the Citizens Directive  provides  that
       in specific cases where there is a reasonable doubt as to whether  an
       EU citizen  satisfies  the  conditions  for  residence  conferred  by
       Article 7 (i.e. whether they are exercising Treaty rights)  a  Member
       State may verify if these  conditions  are  fulfilled.  As  shown  by
       McCarthy [2015] QB 651, EEA applications fall to be determined via an
       individual examination of the particular case.


   20. I accordingly find that there was no error of law in the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal. If the Secretary of State has concerns as to
       the ongoing genuineness  of  the  relationship,  then  doubtless  the
       matter could be investigated further  when  EEA  permanent  residence
       rights are assessed in a future application, and the  file  could  be
       marked as appropriate for such treatment.

      Decision:

    The appeal is dismissed.



Signed:                                            Date: 2 January 2018
