                           DETERMINATION & REASONS



   1. This is an appeal, by the , against the  decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal (Judge Mohd.  Asif  Khan),  sitting  at  Harmondsworth  on  2
      August, to  a human rights appeal against deportation by a citizen  of
      Kenya, born 20 June 1992.

   2. The appellant said he had arrived with his aunt on  a  visit  visa  in
      2003; but it was not till 2010 that any application was made  for  him
      to have leave to remain. That was finally refused in 2014: though  the
      First-tier Tribunal allowed an appeal against that decision  in  2015,
      the appeal was dismissed by the Upper Tribunal  (deputy  Judge  Vinesh
      Mandalia) on 30 August 2016.

   3. Meanwhile from October 2014 to January 2015 the appellant and a  woman
      called Oprah Yeboah, with others, had been using her bank  account  to
      hold the proceeds of criminal activity on  their  part,  amounting  to
      �28,000. On 15 December  2015  the  appellant  and  another  man  were
      arrested on suspicion  of  stealing  from  letter-boxes  belonging  to
      householders: he was found in possession of a master  key  capable  of
      opening over 100 boxes on the estate in question, as well as  a  bunch
      of other keys which opened a number of them.

   4. The judge was aware (see his paragraphs 13 and 15) that there had been
      two separate indictments; but this is how he dealt with  the  criminal
      proceedings against this appellant, at 42:

       The two offence [sic] for which the appellant  was  sentenced  to  12
       months imprisonment arose out of a single incident but there were two
       counts on the indictment. The appellant pleaded guilty to  one  count
       but was found guilty by the jury after a trial on  the  other  count.
       All  criminal  activity  is  serious  but  there  are   degrees   and
       persistency, which have to be considered. The appellant had not  been
       before a criminal court, prior to these two  convictions,  he  had  a
       clean slate.

   5. What had actually happened was this: on 16 June  2017  the  appellant,
      who had been found guilty after trial on two counts of going equipped,
      on the first indictment, was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment.  On
      26 October he pled guilty, late in the day,  because  the  prosecution
      had already made a bad character application, to put in the  facts  of
      his previous conviction, to the money-laundering indictment,  and  was
      sentenced to 16 months, concurrently with the previous  sentence.  The
      sentencing remarks of both judges were listed as attached to the  Home
      Office appeal bundle; but there was no sign of either.

   6. The judge went on at 43 to say "I find that  the  appellant  is  truly
      remorseful for his actions and I accept the findings of the  probation
      report that he is a low risk and is unlikely to  offend  again".  What
      the judge seems to have failed to notice is that this was  the  report
      prepared for the June hearing,  whose  conclusions  had  clearly  been
      overtaken by what was to happen in October.

   7. The result is that the judge was wrong in law to decide the appeal  on
      that basis. As it happened, Mr  Ren�  and  Mrs  Fijiwala  had  already
      identified another error  on  his  part.  This  involved  the  judge's
      acceptance at 45 that the appellant was entitled  to  the  benefit  of
      paragraph 399 of the Rules, on the basis of his relationship with  his
      girl-friend. This was not the case, since 399 (b) required not only  a
      'genuine and subsisting relationship' with a partner who  was  British
      or settled here, but that (i) it should have been  formed  at  a  time
      when the person facing deportation was lawfully here.

   8. While the presenting officer had accepted before the  judge  that  the
      appellant could not personally be blamed for the period he  had  spent
      here without leave while he was still under 18, the fact remains  that
      he never has had leave of any kind, and cannot benefit from  paragraph
      399 (b) at all; or, for the same reason, 399A. The result is (see A398
      (c)) that in his case

       ... the public interest in deportation will  only  be  outweighed  by
       other factors where there are very compelling circumstances over  and
       above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

   9. Clearly a fresh hearing on that basis was required: I gave  directions
      for filing and serving the missing sentencing remarks, which  had  not
      been done by 7 January, the first adjourned date: there is  no  answer
      to Mr R�n�'s claim for the costs of that hearing. By  4  March,  there
      was a transcript of the October sentencing, but not of the  June  one.
      Mr R�n� urged me to adjourn the hearing yet again; but there  did  not
      seem any need for such an extreme step: so far as the June hearing was
      concerned, a substantial part of the sentencing remarks appears in the
      refusal letter, and Mr Duffy undertook to file and serve the  complete
      version  by  e-mail,  in  case  there  were  anything  in  it  to  the
      appellant's advantage which Mr R�n� wished to draw to my attention.  I
      shall come to what happened on that in due course.

LAW

  10. On 4 March I offered Mr R�n� an opportunity  to  call  oral  evidence,
      especially as to the appellant's attitude  to  his  offending,  if  he
      wished; but he did not. The only issue before  me  was  whether  there
      were the necessary 'very compelling circumstances' in the  case.  This
      appellant is a 'medium offender', in terms  of  NA  (Pakistan)  [2015]
      EWCA Civ 140, and the approach to be taken is set out at paragraph 36

       In relation to a medium offender, first see whether he  falls  within
       Exception 1 or Exception 2. If he does,  then  the  Article  8  claim
       succeeds. If he does not, then the next stage is to consider  whether
       there are "sufficiently  compelling  circumstances,  over  and  above
       those described in Exceptions 1  and  2".  If  there  are,  then  the
       Article 8 claim succeeds. If there are not, then the Article 8  claim
       fails. As was the case under the  2012  rules  (as  explained  in  MF
       (Nigeria)), there is no room  for  a  general  Article  8  evaluation
       outside the 2014 rules, read with sections 117A-117D of the 2002 Act.



  11. Exception 1 is defined in s. 117C (4) of the Act in the same terms  as
      those used in paragraph 399A of the Rules, and formed the basis of  Mr
      R�n�'s argument before me. Exception 2 appears at 117C (4) in slightly
      different form from the one in 399 (b):  so  far  as  relevant,  since
      there is no child in this case, it is this

         Exception  2  applies  where  C  has  a  genuine   and   subsisting
       relationship with a qualifying partner ...  and  the  effect  of  C's
       deportation on the partner ... would be unduly harsh.

  12. Although that does not impose the same limitation on the exception  as
      that in paragraph 399 (b) (ii), Mr R�n� did not seek to argue that the
      effects of the appellant's deportation on his  girl-friend,  presently
      at university, would be unduly harsh. There is however  no  suggestion
      that she is not a British citizen, or that they do not have a 'genuine
      and subsisting relationship' together: she was present,  with  several
      members of his family, at the hearing before me. That much has  to  be
      taken in the appellant's favour on Exception 2.

  13. So far as Exception 1 is concerned, it applies where an appellant

       (a)    ... has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for  most
          of his life,

       (b)    ... is  socially  and  culturally  integrated  in  the  United
          Kingdom, and

       (c)    there would be very significant obstacles to  his  integration
          into the country to    which he is proposed to be deported.

EXCEPTION 1

  14. Dealing first with  condition  (a),  this  appellant  has  never  been
      lawfully resident in this country  at  all:  on  the  other  hand,  as
      already noted, he cannot personally be blamed for not taking any steps
      to regularize his position here  till  he  reached  18.  On  (b),  the
      decision-maker (refusal letter pp  7  -  8)  reviewed  the  sentencing
      judges' remarks, and went on

       It is evident that your offences were committed  for  monetary  gain.
       You do not appear to have given any thought to the effects that  your
       crimes would have had on your victims,  the  stress  caused  and  the
       frustration of loss they would have felt.

       It is not accepted that you are socially and culturally integrated in
       the UK. Your involvement with criminal activity  indicates  that  you
       have chosen not to contribute to the  wider  society  in  a  positive
       manner and have shown a serious disregard for British law.

  15. Mr R�n� did not challenge these conclusions;  but  he  argued  that  a
      broader assessment was required, no doubt something along the lines of
      the 'broad evaluative judgment' (see Kamara  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  813  ,
      paragraph  14)  needed  as  to  prospects  of   integration  into  the
      destination country. The decision-maker went on to note

       You have not had permission to work in the UK and have  not  provided
       any evidence that you have undertaken any employment.  Therefore  you
       have been unable  to  demonstrate  that  you  have  made  a  positive
       contribution to the UK.

  16. This is also right, though Mr R�n� pointed out that the appellant  had
      been able to produce a certificate (22 September 2017), showing he had
      successfully completed the  'Getting  it  Right'  programme  while  in
      prison: there was also a letter (undated, but said by the appellant to
      be from 28  December  2018),  from  the  manager  of  an  Oxfam  shop,
      describing him as a valuable volunteer in her team for the  last  four
      months (effectively since his release from prison on 22 August).

  17. Besides that evidence about how the appellant has  behaved  in  prison
      and since, there was a great deal of evidence before the judge to show
      how well he did at school, and especially  at  football  (specifically
      mentioned by the judge who sentenced him in June).  If  the  appellant
      had gone on in the same way after he left school, then  I  should  not
      have considered it  too  hard  to  show  that  he  was  'socially  and
      culturally integrated' here.

  18. However, that is  not  what  happened.  As  Mr  R�n�  suggested,  some
      allowance has to be made for  the  appellant's  frustration  at  being
      prevented by his immigration status from taking full advantage of work
      and study opportunities in this country; however his criminal activity
      was not the result of any momentary impulse. Each indictment  involved
      a  different  period,  and  a  different  co-defendant.   The   money-
      laundering, towards the end of 2014, involved someone buying  a  Range
      Rover from an innocent seller with a cloned credit card:  the  �28,000
      got by that was put into a bank account in the name of  a  woman,  who
      the sentencing judge said the appellant had used.  �10,000  was  drawn
      out before a stop was put on it.





  19. The judge said it was  a  significant  aggravating  feature  that  the
      appellant had used the woman, who trusted him, in this  way:  she  had
      neither known  nor  suspected  the  fraud,  but  had  been  prosecuted
      herself. The appellant had exposed her to that risk, and to  a  prison
      sentence, if convicted, and the judge regarded that as  a  feature  of
      the appellant's high culpability, added to  by  the  amount  of  money
      involved, and the loss to the owner, involving a total of �38,000 owed
      on a car he no longer had.

  20. As for the going equipped in December  2015,  the  appellant  and  the
      other man both denied the purpose for which they had the keys  to  the
      letter-boxes in their car, and in the case of the master-key,  on  the
      appellant himself. However the jury rejected the suggestion that  they
      had been seen on the estate concerned by mere coincidence.  These  too
      were clearly offences planned for gain.

  21. This was something the appellant admitted to the author  of  the  June
      pre-sentencing report [PSR]; but only after he had been convicted. His
      explanation was that "times were hard": he was  having  problems  with
      immigration and wanted to become a professional footballer, but had no
      money. He still did not explain how he had come to be in possession of
      the keys, though he did now admit what he had had them for. The report-
      writer said he took responsibility for what he had done, and expressed
      what appeared to be genuine remorse, though in terms  of  ruining  his
      career and letting his family down.

  22. The appellant was already serving his sentence for those  offences  by
      the time he was dealt with for  the  money-laundering.  There  was  no
      further PSR this time, and the sentencing judge said in terms that  he
      had entered his guilty plea very late in the day, only when  the  case
      was before the court for trial. The judge allowed him a  reduction  of
      little more than the 10% normally carried by a  plea  on  the  day  of
      trial.

  23. The OASys 'Basic Risk Review' report  of  24  January  2018  does  not
      relate to the money-laundering at all: it refers only to the  sentence
      passed on 16 June 2017, and the facts  of  the  going  equipped  case.
      There is also a letter from the appellant's  probation  officer  of  3
      January 2019, saying that "Using an actuarial tool ..."  he  had  been
      assessed as 27% likely to re-offend within one year,  and  43%  within
      two.  However  he  had  been  "...  fully  compliant  with   probation
      instructions and  has  engaged  within  supervision  sessions  and  is
      working hard to address his offending behaviour".

  24. I asked Mr R�n� why, if the appellant was truly gripped by remorse, at
      least by the time he went to prison, he had not  pled  guilty  to  the
      money-laundering till a very  late  stage  in  that  case.  Mr  R�n�'s
      explanation, so far as it went,  was  that  there  had  been  previous
      proceedings on that case, abortive owing to defects in the prosecution
      evidence. While that may be so, this appellant was the  principal,  in
      fact the sole offender in the money-laundering,  and  there  does  not
      seem to have been anything to stop him pleading guilty to  the  charge
      on which he was sentenced, as soon as it was put to him.







  25. I very much take into account the appellant's obvious closeness to his
      own family, and their presence and support  at  the  hearing;  nor  is
      there any question about his  'genuine  and  subsisting  relationship'
      with his girl-friend. However, for 'social and cultural  integration',
      wider factors have to be considered. The  appellant  might  have  been
      able to show it, if the question had arisen before the  end  of  2014;
      but at both ends of the following  year,  he  was  committing  serious
      planned offences for gain. While he was prepared to admit  having  the
      keys for that purpose, after he had been convicted of it in  2017,  he
      did not say how he had come by them. If he had been brought  up  sharp
      by that conviction, and genuinely decided to mend his ways, then it is
      hard to see why he did not plead guilty to the money-laundering till a
      very late stage.

  26. I do give the appellant credit for the course he did  in  prison,  and
      for the voluntary work he has done since; and he has not got into  any
      more trouble since his release. However, that was only just  over  six
      months ago, and, based on his record, his risk of re-offending  within
      two years is not low at 47%. I cannot  regard  him  as  'socially  and
      culturally integrated' as things stand.

  27. Turning to condition (c) ''very significant obstacles'', this question
      was addressed at some length by Judge Mandalia, who  described  it  at
      the central issue on the appeal  before  him.  As  he  explained,  the
      appellant had not by the date of his then application spent more  than
      half of his life here, so that was the test  he  had  to  meet,  under
      paragraph 276ADE (vi). While Mr R�n� sought to argue that this is  not
      so now, the  question  of  'very  significant  obstacles'  now  arises
      directly under s. 117C, and so remains the test the appellant  has  to
      meet.  As  Mr  R�n�  accepted,  Judge   Mandalia's   decision   stands
      unappealed, and represents the last word on the facts before him:  see
      Devaseelan (Second Appeals - ECHR - Extra-Territorial  Effect)  [2002]
      UKIAT 702*.

  28. Judge Mandalia noted that the appellant had  no  immediate  family  to
      return to in Ghana; but found that he could take  steps  to  establish
      contact with his maternal uncle, and get short-term help from him.  It
      might not be easy for the  appellant  there;  but  his  aunt  in  this
      country (Mrs Asamoah) had kept in touch with  friends  in  Ghana,  and
      been to visit his mother's grave herself: the appellant would  not  be
      without help on that side either.

  29. I invited Mr R�n� to let me know any changes  for  the  worse  in  the
      appellant's situation on return to Ghana. He cited the passage of time
      itself, which he said would make things harder for him. Mr  R�n�  also
      referred me to Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813  paragraph 14

       ... the concept  of  a  foreign  criminal's  "integration"  into  the
       country to which it is proposed that he be deported, as  set  out  in
       section 117C(4)(c) and paragraph 399A, is a  broad  one.  It  is  not
       confined to the mere ability to find a job or to sustain  life  while
       living in the other country. It  is  not  appropriate  to  treat  the
       statutory language as subject to some gloss and it  will  usually  be
       sufficient for a court or tribunal simply to  direct  itself  in  the
       terms that Parliament has chosen to use. The  idea  of  "integration"
       calls for a broad evaluative judgment to be made as  to  whether  the
       individual will be enough of an insider in terms of understanding how
       life in the society in  that  other  country  is  carried  on  and  a
       capacity to participate in it, so as to have a reasonable opportunity
       to be accepted there, to be able to operate on a day-to-day basis  in
       that society and to build up within a reasonable time  a  variety  of
       human relationships to give substance to the individual's private  or
       family life.

  30. Mr R�n� went on to argue that the  appellant,  having  only  lived  in
      Ghana till he was ten, when  he  would  still  have  been  at  primary
      school, could not be considered an 'insider'  there,  and  would  find
      life correspondingly  difficult.  This  point,  like  the  appellant's
      family situation, was fully considered by Judge Mandalia,  and  I  was
      not referred to any evidence to show that things  would  have  changed
      for the worse for him on either front. Another 2� or 3 years away from
      Ghana are likely to have made less difference in that direction   than
      the added experience of life he will have had here in the other.

  31. In view of Mr Duffy's  offer  to  file  and  serve  the  two  sets  of
      sentencing remarks by e-mail, I gave the parties till 15 March to make
      any further submissions on those, or on Olarewaju [2018] EWCA Civ 557,
      which I drew to their attention, especially  paragraph  26.  Olarewaju
      was a young man who had had leave to be here, for  just  over  a  year
      before he reached 18. Even before he reached that  age,  he  had  been
      given 18 months' detention for possession  of  class  'A'  drugs  with
      intent to supply, following convictions for other  criminal  offences:
      while he had received a considerably longer, but still medium sentence
      later on, that did not form part of the decision  under  consideration
      by the Court of Appeal (see their paragraph 4). As a  result,  he  too
      needed to show the necessary 'very compelling circumstances' over  and
      above those set out in Exceptions 1 and 2 or paragraphs 399 and 399A.

  32. I received a copy of the sentencing remarks  in  the  money-laundering
      case, but those in the going equipped are only available to the extent
      set out in the decision letter, which does however appear  to  include
      most of them.. As I made clear, that was enough for me to decide  this
      appeal; but the Home Office should realize that a copy of the complete
      sentencing remarks ought to be made available in their  appeal  bundle
      in every deportation case. If nothing else, it might save the kind  of
      mistake made by the judge in this one.

  33. On Olarewaju, I received submissions by e-mail from  Mr  Duffy,  which
      are reflected in my conclusions. There was  nothing  further  from  Mr
      R�n� by the date set, so I went on to decide this appeal.

CONCLUSIONS

  34. As Mr R�n� agreed, the only arguable  'very  compelling  circumstance'
      over and above Exceptions 1 and 2 in this case  concerns  the  age  at
      which the appellant came here from Ghana, and the length  of  time  he
      has been away from there. Youth on its own cannot amount  to  a  'very
      compelling circumstance' (see Olarewaju, paragraph 26); nor it  seems,
      did the time spent away by the appellant in that case,  who  had  come
      here when he was nine.

  35. Judge Mandalia considered this appellant's situation in  2016,  though
      in terms of 'very significant obstacles' to return. It does  not  seem
      to me that anything has happened since  Judge  Mandalia  reached  that
      decision to show that there are now the 'very  significant  obstacles'
      to this appellant's return to Ghana which there  were  not  then.  The
      result is that, even though the appellant himself cannot be blamed for
      his residence here up to 2010 not being lawful,  he  cannot  establish
      any of the conditions for Exception  1  to  apply,  and  exception  2,
      realistically, was not argued.

  36. So far as the other general points made at paragraph 26  of  Olarewaju
      are concerned, the Court of  Appeal  referred  back  to  the  passages
      already cited from Hesham Ali (Iraq) [2016]  UKSC  60:  "great  weight
      should generally be given to the public interest in the deportation of
      a foreign offender who has received a custodial sentence of more  than
      12 months"; "in  any  event  the  significance  of  rehabilitation  is
      limited by the fact that the risk of reoffending is only one facet  of
      the public interest"; and, where paragraphs 399 and 399A of the  Rules
      do not apply, in general "only a claim which is very strong indeed ...
      will succeed".

  37. The evidence of rehabilitation here, or difficulties on return in this
      case, if anything go even less far than in Olarewaju . This was by  no
      means a claim which could be described as 'very  strong  indeed',  and
      the appellant's appeal against deportation must be dismissed.
