The Upper Tribunal
(Immigration and Asylum Chamber)  Appeal number: IA/16960/2014


                                THE IMMIGRATION ACTS


                                   Decision Promulgated

                                   On 5th November 2015



                                   Between

                            CHASE ALEXANDER BJORK

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


 DECISION ON WITHDRAWAL PURSUANT TO RULE 17 OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER
                            TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008


   1. This appeal came before me following a grant of permission  to  appeal
      against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Fox who  dismissed  an
      appeal against a decision by the  respondent  to  refuse  to  issue  a
      residence card.

   2. It was conceded at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal that the
      appellant was not able to establish his  entitlement  to  a  residence
      card. The  appeal  under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
      Regulations 2006, and under Article 8 of the ECHR was dismissed.

   3. At the hearing before me, following my decision to refuse  to  adjourn
      the appeal pending the outcome of an appeal to the Court of Appeal  in
      the case of Amirteymour and others (EEA appeals; human rights)  [2015]
      UKUT 00466 (IAC), the appellant sought to withdraw the appeal.

   4. As I pointed out at the hearing, rule 17  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
      (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 provides that a party may give  notice  of
      the withdrawal of its case or part of it, subject to  the  consent  of
      the Upper Tribunal. There is no provision for a party to withdraw  the
      appeal before the Upper Tribunal. Having accepted that  the  purported
      withdrawal of the appellant's appeal is in effect a withdrawal of  the
      appellant's case before  the  Upper  Tribunal,  I  consented  to  that
      withdrawal.

   5. The effect therefore, is that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
      is to stand.
