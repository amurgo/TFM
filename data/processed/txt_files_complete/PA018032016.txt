                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Ms N Loughran & Co, of Loughran & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent refused the appellant's claim for reasons  explained  in
    her letter dated 9 February 2106.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Farrelly dismissed the appellant's appeal for
    reasons explained in his decision promulgated on 20 March 2017.

 3. The appellant's 3 grounds of appeal are stated in the  application  for
    permission to appeal filed on 15 August 2017 (which in terms of the  TP
    (UT) Rules 2008, rule 23 (1A), now stands as the notice  of  appeal  to
    the UT).

 4. Ms Loughran submitted further to the grounds  as  follows.   (1):   The
    appellant answered questions about his claimed home area  in  Iran,  as
    cited in the ground, and was shown to  be  correct  by  the  background
    information in his inventory 4, items C & B.  The judge "failed to give
    weight" to those correct answers.  (2):  It  was  natural  for  further
    detail to emerge in an account.  The judge placed "too much weight"  on
    perceived  failure  to  mention  active  involvement  in  the  KDPI  at
    screening interview.  (3):  In assessing the appellant's  knowledge  of
    the KDPI, the judge gave "not enough weight" to what was reasonably  to
    be expected of a person who was illiterate and uneducated.

 5. Mr Matthews submitted thus.  The reasoning for the conclusion  at  �31,
    criticised in ground (1), was at �21: if  the  appellant's  nationality
    was as claimed, he could have brought  evidence  to  support  it.   His
    failure to do so went unexplained.  That reasoning was sensible, and no
    ground was directed against it.  The judge acknowledged the  extent  of
    the appellant's knowledge, and gave it some weight.  There was no  lack
    of reasoning, as the ground asserted, and the  degree  of  weight,  the
    subject of submission, was for the judge.  As to ground (2), the  judge
    said that "screening was not dealing with  detail",  acknowledging  the
    principle invoked by the ground, and was entitled to find that a  plain
    omission showed later embellishment.  On ground (3), the judge recorded
    the appellant's evidence of lack of education at �28.  He  appeared  to
    doubt it, although he made no specific finding.  The  ground,  however,
    was no more than a disagreement.  It showed no  error  in  the  factual
    assessment at �28 - 30, which was based on an unpersuasive  explanation
    for his alleged lack of education; allowance to be made for the  stress
    of interview, but balanced in the round;  and  the  questionability  of
    limited knowledge even of a secretive organisation, if his father was a
    martyr in the cause and his [activist] uncle lived in the same house.

 6. In response, Ms Loughran said that although the reasoning  at  �21  was
    not specifically challenged, there is a general rule that corroboration
    is not required; it should be taken into account  that  in  context  it
    might be dangerous to request information from the appellant's  family;
    and the judge  failed  to  take  account  of  the  explanation  in  the
    appellant's witness statement that he  was  not  educated  because  his
    mother feared that education and political  involvement  went  hand  in
    hand.

 7. I reserved my decision.

 8. The submissions of both parties were accurately and succinctly put.

 9. Having considered the grounds and those submissions, I find  that  each
    ground has been  effectively  countered  by  the  respondent,  for  the
    reasons summarised above.

10. The grounds do not challenge the reasoning at �21.

11. That  reasoning  is  patently  sound,  and  is  based  on  the  general
    obligation  on  an  appellant  to  advance  his  case,   not   on   any
    misconception of the law on corroboration.

12. It is too late now to develop  the  case  by  way  of  the  dangers  of
    forwarding documentary evidence.

13. In any event, it is difficult to see why  it  should  be  dangerous  or
    difficult to arrange for routine items to be  conveyed  to  the  UK  by
    email or post.

14.  Individually  and  as  a  whole,  the  grounds  are   insistence   and
    disagreement on the facts, rather  than  disclosure  of  error  on  any
    points of law.  They do not show that the decision falls short  of  the
    principles cited, or that it is anything less than a  legally  adequate
    explanation to the appellant of why he  has  failed  to  establish  his
    case.

15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

16. An anonymity direction was made in the FtT, although  for  no  apparent
    reason.  The matter was not addressed in the  UT.   This  decision  has
    been anonymised.
