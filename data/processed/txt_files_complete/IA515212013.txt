                            DECISION AND REASONS



The appellant is a Nigerian national who is now 27 years' old.

The appeal is against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Mulvenna
which dismissed the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR.

The appellant was not  represented  before  me.  I  provided  him  with  the
Tribunal bundle. It became apparent  that  he  was  not  familiar  with  key
documents in  the  case,  in  particular  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal, the grounds of appeal and the grant of  permission  to  appeal.  I
offered the appellant until 2pm to consider these documents but it  was  his
preference to proceed after an adjournment of half an hour. At  the  end  of
that period of time, the appellant indicated that he wished to proceed  with
the hearing. He gave his views on the case and I also heard from Mr Nath.  I
reserved my decision.

The background to this matter is that the appellant entered  the  UK  on  10
January 2010. He had leave until 30 March 2013 as a student. On 31  December
2011 he married a British national. They  had  a  daughter  together  on  30
August 2012. The marriage broke down. The  appellant's  wife  prevented  him
from seeing his daughter and he made an application to the family court  for
contact. The respondent granted him exceptional leave to remain in order  to
pursue the family court action, that leave ending on 7 October 2013.  On  19
June 2013 he obtained an order allowing contact twice a month at  a  contact
centre. He was also required to pay maintenance for the child.

The appellant applied for further leave to remain as a parent on  3  October
2013 but that application was refused under the Immigration Rules and  under
Article 8 of the ECHR.

The appeal then came before Judge Mulvenna on the papers.

The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal against the  decision  of  Judge
Mulvenna maintained ZH  (Tanzania)  v  SSHD  [2011]  UKSC  4  had  not  been
correctly applied and the best interests  of  a  British  child  incorrectly
assessed. Her best  interests  were  to  develop  a  relationship  with  her
father.  They  also  argued  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal   should   have
determined the Article 8 claim.

At [12] to [18] Judge  Mulvenna  set  out  the  correct  law  and  case  law
regarding the best interests of the appellant's  child.  The  provisions  of
s.55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act  2009  was  clearly  in
mind in the assessment that was conducted at [19].

At [19] he found that the appellant was seeing the child via a third  party,
the contact centre. That was correct. He found that an application for  more
access to the child was pending. That was also correct. He  found  that  the
child usually lived with its mother, also correct.

However, where family life can be presumed to exist  between  a  parent  and
child and the contact order was before the judge  and  where  the  appellant
was actively pursuing further contact, it is my view that it could be  right
to conclude simply that the "most significant contribution  to  the  child's
welfare at present appears to be financial" and proceed on  the  basis  that
the financial support could continue from Nigeria,  the  best  interests  of
the child not  being  affected  by  the  appellant's  removal.  His  removal
deprived the child of the regular contact  she  was  having  with  him  and,
realistically, of any additional contact that  the  appellant  was  actively
seeking at that time. As in  LD  (Article  8  -  best  interests  of  child)
Zimbabwe [2010] UKUT 278  (IAC)  "[f]amilies  normally  live  together"  and
"[i]t is not normal for family life to  be  enjoyed  by  correspondence  and
occasional visits (even assuming  that  there  were  no  obstacles  to  such
visits following this immigration decision)."

I accepted that the consideration of the child's best interests  was  flawed
to the extent that it should be set aside and re-made.

The grounds of appeal also  had  merit  as  regards  the  failure  of  Judge
Mulvenna to determine the Article 8 appeal that was before him.

The respondent's decision  refused  the  appellant's  application  in  terms
under Article 8. The grounds of appeal are not of the clearest but it  reads
them too narrowly to say that they do  not  raise  Article  8  issues.  They
centre on the appellant's relationship with his  child.  At  [21],  however,
Judge Mulvenna states that "I have  no  detailed  arguments  or  submissions
form either party on the question of Article  8  and  have  not,  therefore,
considered the position."

It was incumbent on Judge Mulvenna to determine the Article 8 appeal  before
him regardless of the paucity of evidence or  submissions.  Where  the  s.55
assessment is flawed, it did not appear to me that it  could  be  said  with
certainty what the outcome of an Article 8 assessment would have been.

I therefore set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  entirely  and
re-made it.

There is no dispute as to the appellant  failing  to  meet  the  substantive
Immigration Rules concerning leave to remain as a parent.

The difficulty for the appellant here is that  the  evidence  before  me  is
that the family court have not only declined to increase  his  contact  with
his daughter but that the contact has ceased, the appellant's  contact  with
his daughter now being only indirect via cards, letters and gifts.  A  final
court order dated 24 April 2014 states this to be so.

Where the specialist family  court  has  assessed  that  level  of  indirect
contact as appropriate in its final decision, it did not appear to  me  that
the best interests of  the  appellant's  child  could  now  be  said  to  be
materially affected by his return  to  Nigeria.  He  can  continue  indirect
contact with her in the same way from  abroad.  The  economic  situation  in
Nigeria may be less advantageous than that in the UK  but  I  did  not  have
country evidence before me to suggest that the  appellant  could  only  earn
�60 a month as he submitted at the hearing such that his ability to  support
his child would be significantly affected. He is, in any event, only  paying
�5 a week at present according to the  evidence  before  me.  There  is  the
additional matter that the appellant has already had a  year  of  additional
leave to remain to address the contact situation with his daughter  but  the
matter has ended, sadly, to his detriment.

In short, where  the  appellant  does  not  have  direct  contact  with  his
daughter, I did not find that the respondent's decision to refuse leave  was
a disproportionate interference with the appellant's family  life  with  his
daughter.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error  on  a  point  of
law and is set aside.

I remake the Article 8 appeal as refused.


Anonymity

I make an anonymity order under Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008, precluding publication of  any  information  regarding
the proceedings which would be likely to  lead  members  of  the  public  to
identify the appellant, his partner or his child.   I  do  so  in  the  best
interests of the child in order to protect her identity and wellbeing.
