                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Sowersby, instructed by Russell Wise,
solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms S Cunah, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.


2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Greasley promulgated on 04  December  2018,  which  dismissed
the Appellant's appeal.

Background


3. The Appellant was born on 2 December 1993 and is a  national  of  Turkey.
On 9 May 2018 the Secretary of State  refused  the  Appellant's  application
for indefinite leave to remain in the UK.

The Judge's Decision

4. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Greasley ("the Judge") dismissed the appeal against  the  Respondent's
decision. Grounds of appeal were lodged and on  28  December  2018  Judge  J
Grant-Hutchison granted permission to appeal stating inter alia


      ...It is arguable that the Judge has misdirected himself by  the  lack
      of consideration of the  appellant's  private  and  family  life  both
      within and outside the immigration rules  when  considering  that  the
      appellant has two British children (one is 3ï¿½ years old and the  other
      one-year-old) and the best interests of the children under section  55
      of the Borders Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.

The Hearing

5. On 17 January 2019 the respondent served a rule 24  response  which  says
inter alia

      2. The respondent does not  oppose  the  appellant's  application  for
      permission to appeal. It  is  accepted  that  the  appellant  has  two
      British children and the FTIJ materially erred by failing to  consider
      section 55 or 117B(6). The Tribunal is therefore respectfully  invited
      to set aside the FTT determination.


      3. It is accepted in light of the Supreme Court decision of KO and the
      Secretary of State's policy guidance confirming that British  children
      are not expected to leave the EU, the children cannot be  expected  to
      return to Turkey with the appellant. The Tribunal is therefore invited
      to remake the FTT determination, allowing the appellant's appeal.


      4. The Secretary of State respectfully invites  the  Tribunal  to  set
      aside and remake the FTT determination allowing the appeal.

6. Ms Cunah told me that the appeal is no longer resisted. Of  consent,  she
asked me to set the decision aside, although preserving the Judge's  finding
that the appellant cannot meet the suitability requirements of appendix  FM,
and to substitute my own decision allowing the  appeal  on  article  8  ECHR
grounds  because  the  appellant  is  the  mother  of  two  British  citizen
children.


Analysis

7. The respondent's decision dwells on paragraph 322(1A) of the  immigration
rules. The respondent insists that the appellant relies  on  a  fraudulently
obtained English language  test  in  an  earlier  application.  The  Judge's
findings of fact lie between [18] and  [23]  of  the  decision.  There,  the
Judge draws entirely on the English language test and whether or  not  false
representations made. At [21] the Judge finds that the  appellant  does  not
meet the suitability requirements of appendix FM.

8. At [22] the Judge finds that the appellant can return to Turkey and  make
an application for entry clearance from there. At [23] the Judge  says  that
the appellant's two children can accompany her to Turkey.

9. The Judge's article 8 analysis is both  incomplete  and  inadequate.  The
Judge does not properly take account of the fact that the appellant  is  the
mother of two British citizen children. The Judge does not consider  section
117B(6) of the 2002 Act. That  is  a  material  error  of  law.  I  set  the
decision aside. I am invited to substitute my own decision.

The Facts

10. The appellant is a Turkish  national,  born  on  2  December  1993.  The
appellant entered the UK on 2 February 2014 with leave to remain in  the  UK
until 31 March 2016. The respondent extended leave until 17 May 2018. On  15
January 2018 the appellant applied for indefinite leave  to  remain  as  the
spouse of a settled person.

11. The appellant's husband is a British  citizen.  The  appellant  and  her
husband have two children both under the age of  five  years.  Both  of  the
children are British citizens. The appellant  lives  with  her  husband  and
their two children in the UK.

12. On 30 November 2017 the appellant's attempt to sit  a  Life  in  the  UK
exam was abruptly halted when an invigilator  believed  that  the  appellant
was using a Bluetooth  communication  device  to  cheat  in  the  test.  The
appellant subsequently re-sat the test and passed it.

The immigration rules

13. On the respondent's  unopposed  motion,  I  am  asked  to  preserve  the
Judge's  findings  that  the  appellant  does  not  meet   the   suitability
requirements of appendix FM. On  the  facts  as  I  find  them  to  be,  the
appellant's first attempt to  life  in  the  UK  test  was  terminated.  The
appellant does not meet the suitability requirements  of  appendix  FM,  but
the focus in this case is on article 8 ECHR grounds of appeal.




Article 8 ECHR

14. What is beyond dispute is that  the  appellant  is  the  mother  of  two
British citizen children. On the facts as I find them to be,  the  appellant
has a genuine and subsisting relationship with  two  British  citizens.  The
unchallenged evidence is that  the  appellant's  husband  and  children  are
British citizens present in the UK, with whom the appellant normally  lives.
Article 8 family life exists for the appellant.

15. The respondent's IDIs on Family Migration (Paragraph 11.2.3) deals  with
British children. The  August  2015  version  states  that,  save  in  cases
involving criminality, the decision  maker  must  not  take  a  decision  in
relation to the parent or primary carer of a  British  Citizen  child  where
the effect of that decision would be to force that British  child  to  leave
the EU, regardless of the age of that child. However, it  also  states  that
"where a decision to refuse  the  application  would  require  a  parent  or
primary carer to return to a country outside the EU, the  case  must  always
be assessed on the basis that it would be unreasonable to expect  a  British
Citizen child to leave the EU  with  that  parent  or  primary  carer".  The
section goes on to address the grant of leave to the parent indicating  that
it may not be appropriate if there is no satisfactory evidence of a  genuine
and subsisting parental relationship or where the conduct of the  parent  or
primary carer gives rise to considerations of  such  weight  as  to  justify
separation but none of that gets round the  unequivocal  statement  that  it
would always be unreasonable to expect a British child to leave the EU.

16. The Upper Tribunal in SF and others (Guidance,  post-2014  Act)  Albania
[2017] UKUT 00120 (IAC) held, considering this guidance  that  even  in  the
absence of a "not  in  accordance  with  the  law"  ground  of  appeal,  the
Tribunal ought to take the Secretary of State's guidance into account if  it
points clearly to a particular outcome in the instant case.   Only  in  that
way can consistency be obtained between  those  cases  that  do,  and  those
cases that do not, come before the Tribunal

17. The guidance given by the respondent in the  IDIs  on  Family  Migration
(February 2018) is that the questions a decision maker should now pose  are:


      (i) is there a genuine and subsisting parental relationship?
      (ii) is the child a British citizen or have they lived in the UK for a
      continuous period of at least 7 years?
      (iii) will the consequence of the refusal of the application  be  that
      the child is required to leave the UK?
      (iv) would it be reasonable to expect the child to leave  the  UK.  In
      many cases where one parent has a right to remain in the UK, the child
      would not leave?

18.  The respondent's guidance suggests that the test is whether  the  child
would be likely to leave rather than actually be  required  to  leave.   The
Home Office now say the impact on the child  of  the  appellant's  departure
from the UK should be considered taking into account the best  interests  of
the  child  as  a  primary  consideration  and  if  refusal  would  lead  to
unjustifiably harsh consequences, then leave can be granted on the basis  of
exceptional circumstances.

19. It does not follow that section 117(6)  should  be  interpreted  in  the
same way as the SSHD  interprets  his  immigration  rules.   In  R  (on  the
application of MA (Pakistan) and Others) v Upper Tribunal  (Immigration  and
Asylum Chamber) and Another [2016] EWCA Civ 705 it was held (see [19])  that
when applying section 117B(6) only three questions needed  to  be  asked  as
long as the applicant was not liable to  deportation,  and  those  questions
are

      (i) is there a genuine and subsisting parental relationship?
      (ii) is the child a British citizen or have they lived in the UK for a
      continuous period of at least 7 years?
      (iv) would it be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK?

20. The respondent's rule 24 response accepts that the appellant's  children
cannot be expected to go to Turkey.  The appellant's  unchallenged  evidence
is that the appellant's husband and  children  are  British  citizens.   The
weight of reliable evidence indicates that the children would be  distressed
if their parents are separated. Caselaw tells me that it  is  in  a  child's
best interests to live in a family with both of their parents. It cannot  be
reasonable to cause young children distress.  It  cannot  be  reasonable  to
separate the children from one of their parents.

21.  On the  facts  as  I  find  them  to  be,  family  life  exists.   The
respondent's decision is an interference with that family life. The  burden
therefore shifts to the  respondent  to  show  that  the  interference  was
justified. The respondent relied solely on the public interest in effective
immigration control, but now concedes that this appeal should be allowed on
article 8 ECHR  grounds  because  it  is  in  the  best  interests  of  the
appellant's children that they (and the appellant) should remain in the UK,
and because it is not reasonable to expect the children to leave the UK.

22.  In R (on the application of Chen) v SSHD (Appendix  FM  -  Chikwamba  -
temporary separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC)  it  was
held that (i) Appendix FM does not include  consideration  of  the  question
whether it would be disproportionate to expect an individual  to  return  to
his home country to make an entry clearance application  to  re-join  family
members in the U.K. There may be cases in which there are no  insurmountable
obstacles to family life being enjoyed outside the U.K. but where  temporary
separation to  enable  an  individual  to  make  an  application  for  entry
clearance may be  disproportionate.  In  all  cases,  it  will  be  for  the
individual to place  before  the  Secretary  of  State  evidence  that  such
temporary  separation  will  interfere  disproportionately  with   protected
rights. It will not be enough to rely solely upon  the  case-law  concerning
Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40. (ii) Lord  Brown  was  not  laying  down  a
legal test when he suggested in Chikwamba that requiring a claimant to  make
an application for entry clearance  would  only  "comparatively  rarely"  be
proportionate in a case involving children.   However, where  a  failure  to
comply in a particular capacity is the only issue so far as  the  Rules  are
concerned, that may well be an insufficient reason  for  refusing  the  case
under Article 8 outside the rules.

23.  In Agyarko [2017] UKSC 10 Lord Reed said again that  if  an  applicant,
even if residing in the UK unlawfully, was otherwise certain to  be  granted
leave to enter, at least if an application were made from  outside  the  UK,
then there might be no public interest in his or her removal and that  point
was illustrated by Chikwamba.

24. When the respondent's decision was made, the respondent said  that  the
appellant could make a successful application to return to the UK  to  join
her husband and children. Caselaw tells me that the  refusal  of  leave  to
remain must therefore be a disproportionate breach of the right to  respect
for family life. The respondent now concedes that the interference with the
appellant's article 8 rights is disproportionate.

25.   The appellant's children are British.  The focus in this case  is  on
sub-section (6) of Section 117B. Section 117B(6) is in two parts which  are
conjunctive. Section 117B(6)(a) weighs in favour of the  appellant  because
she has a genuine and  subsisting  parental  relationship  with  qualifying
children. It is Section 117B(6)(b) which is determinative of this case.

26.  I  have  already  found  that  it  is  not  reasonable  to  expect  the
appellant's children to leave the UK.  Adhering to the interpretation  given
to s.117B(6) in MA (Pakistan) I  find  that  the  appellant  succeeds  under
section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act.

27.  I  remind  myself  of  Section  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
Immigration Act 2009. In ZH  (Tanzania)  (FC)  (Appellant)  v  Secretary  of
State for the Home Department (Respondent) [2011]  UKSC  4  Lady  Hale  said
that "Although nationality is  not  a  "trump  card"  it  is  of  particular
importance in assessing the best interests of any child".

28.  In R (on the application of MA (Pakistan) and Others) v Upper  Tribunal
(Immigration and Asylum Chamber) and Another [2016]  EWCA  Civ  705  it  was
confirmed that if section 117B(6) applies then "there can be no  doubt  that
section 117B(6) must be read as a  self-contained  provision  in  the  sense
that Parliament has stipulated that where the conditions  specified  in  the
sub-section are satisfied, the public interest will not justify removal."

29. Because the simple wording of section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act,  endorsed
in MA (Pakistan), weighs in the appellant's favour, I find that  the  public
interest does not justify removal. That finding leads me to  the  conclusion
that the respondent's decision is a disproportionate interference  with  the
right to respect for article 8 family life.

30. The respondent's guidance says that it is  unreasonable  to  expect  the
appellant's children to  leave  the  UK.  Family  life  exists  between  the
appellant, her  husband  and  their  children.   The  respondent's  decision
interferes with  article  8  family  life.  The  respondent's  own  guidance
indicates that the interference is disproportionate.

31. In Kaur (children's best interests / public interest  interface)  [2017]
UKUT 14 (IAC) it was held that the "little weight" provisions in Part 5A  of
the 2002 Act do not  entail  an  absolute,  rigid  measurement  or  concept;
"little  weight"  involves  a  spectrum  which,  within  its  self-contained
boundaries, will  result  in  the  measurement  of  the  quantum  of  weight
considered appropriate in the fact sensitive context of every case.

32. Even when  I  give  little  weight  to  the  relationship  between  the
appellant, her husband and their children, the relationship  still  carries
sufficient weight because the article 8 family life that is established  is
not limited to the relationship between the appellant and her husband.  The
article 8 family life established encompasses the interests of two  British
children.

33.  I find that this appeal succeeds  on  article  8  ECHR  (family  life)
grounds.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 4  December  2018  is
tainted by material errors of law and is set aside.

I substitute my own decision

The appeal is allowed on article 8 ECHR grounds.
