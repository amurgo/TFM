Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr N Aghayere, Counsel of Louis Ssekkono Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr G Saunders, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who entered the UK on  20  August
    2011 as a student.  On 3 May 2012 she applied for an EEA residence card
    on the basis that she is the sister-in-law of a Dutch national, Ms Job.
     On 12 September 2012 the respondent  refused  this  application.   She
    appealed.  On 21 November 2012 First-tier  Tribunal  (FtT)  Judge  Ford
    dismissed her appeal.

2.   The judge found and it is not in dispute that the  appellant  had  been
    able to show that since arrival in the UK she has been a member of  the
    household of Ms Job.

3.   However the judge did not consider the appellant had  established  that
    in the country from which she came, Nigeria, she had  been  financially
    dependent on Ms Job.  It was accepted by the  appellant  that  she  had
    never lived in the household of Ms Job in Nigeria.

4.   The grounds contend that at paragraph 22 the judge wrongly  found  that
    because she still had valid leave as a student "it is not necessary for
    her to have a residence card".  I agree that this comment by the  judge
    was ill-founded but it had no material bearing in  the  decision  under
    appeal.

5.   The other ground relied on was that the judge had failed to  apply  the
    correct legal test  of  dependency  within  the  meaning  of  Directive
    2004/EC/38 and  the  implementing  legislation,  regulation  8  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006  in  particular.
    Albeit briefly stated, this ground is well-made.  It is manifest from a
    reading of the judge's decision that he applied  a  "wholly  or  mainly
    dependent" test rather than one based on essential needs.  That  was  a
    plain error of law and, as I cannot exclude that  the  judge  may  have
    assessed the evidence of prior dependency differently  had  he  applied
    the correct test, I consider that his decision must be set aside.

6.   I have all the evidence available on which to re-make the decision  and
    indeed both parties urged that I do so.  Applying the guidance set  out
    in reported decisions of the Tribunal,  Moneke  (EEA  -  OFMs)  Nigeria
    [2011] UKUT  00341  (IAC)  in  particular,  the  burden  rests  on  the
    appellant to show that prior to travelling to the UK from  Nigeria  her
    essential needs were met  by  Ms  Job.   I  do  not  consider  she  has
    discharged this burden for a number of reasons.

7.   First, insofar as there is evidence of Ms Job's  income  and  financial
    circumstances in the years immediately  preceding  her  departure  from
    Nigeria it points to her having  had  very  limited  means,  making  it
    exceedingly unlikely that she was able to support anybody else.

8.   Second, the documentary evidence of financial support was  limited:  in
    2009 there being  only  two  remittances  statements  (totalling  about
    �700); in 2010 also, only two (totalling about �450); and in 2011  only
    three (totalling about �350).

9.   Third insofar as there exists evidence  of  money  being  sent  to  the
    appellant and her family in Nigeria save for two transfers on 6  and  7
    June 2011, it relates to monies sent by Ms Job's husband Joseph, not by
    Ms Job.  As the Court of  Appeal  has  recently  confirmed  in  Ronivon
    Soares [2013] EWCA Civ 575 dependency under regulation 8 must be  shown
    to be dependency on the EEA national, not their spouse.

10.  Fourth, insofar as there exists evidence  to  show  that  Ms  Job  sent
    money to Nigeria, although all the money transfers produced  were  made
    payable to the appellant, the appellant's own evidence was that  Joseph
    had sent financial support to her and her parents.  Further  the  three
    witnesses had not given consistent evidence as to who  this  money  was
    for, the appellant saying the monies sent by Joseph were  for  her  and
    her grandmother; Joseph saying it was for  the  support  of  the  whole
    household (his grandmother, the appellant and his step-sister); Ms  Job
    saying the money sent by her and Joseph was for the  appellant.   These
    statements were also difficult to square with  the  evidence  that  the
    appellant had had no contact whatsoever with  her  parents  after  they
    separated when she was a young child and left her in the  care  of  her
    grandmother.

11.  Fifth, despite the appellant and Ms Job and  her  husband  saying  that
    the latter two had paid the appellant's course fees for her studies  in
    Nigeria, no evidence had been produced to show this.

12.  Sixth, on the appellant's  own  evidence  once  she  had  finished  her
    studies in Nigeria she had worked in 2010/2011 as a teacher as part  of
    her national service receiving a monthly stipend of  9,000  naira,  yet
    there was no documentary evidence to explain either whether during  her
    national service she received free accommodation or whether that amount
    sufficed for her own essential needs.

13.  Seventh, although Joseph and Ms Job confirmed that they  had  sponsored
    the appellant to come to the  UK,  they  were  unable  to  produce  any
    documentary evidence of the details of that application, which may have
    clarified what their financial circumstances were said to be then).

14.  Considering all the evidence in the  round,  I  am  entirely  satisfied
    that the appellant has failed to show she was dependent on  Ms  Job  in
    Nigeria prior to coming to the UK.

15.  For the above reasons:

    The FtT judge erred in law and his decision is set aside.  The decision
    I re-make is to dismiss the appellant's appeal.
