                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a national  of  Pakistan  date  of  birth  17th
       January 1983. He has permission to appeal against  the  decision
       of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Munonyedi)  to  dismiss  his
       appeal against the Respondent's decision to refuse to grant  him
       entry clearance as a spouse.

    2. The Respondent's sole ground for refusal  was  maintenance.  The
       Respondent did not consider that the Appellant had  demonstrated
       that his UK Sponsor, Ms Sana Aslam, was earning at or  over  the
       �18,600 required by  paragraph  E-ECP  3.1.  She  had  submitted
       evidence  showing  that  she  is   employed   by   the   Central
       Compensation Office earning �20,000 per annum but  the  evidence
       supplied did not meet the requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE.  The
       date of this decision was 24th May 2013.

    3. The Appellant appealed and the  matter  was  determined  on  the
       papers. The First-tier Tribunal correctly directed  itself  that
       it could only take into account evidence pertaining to the  date
       of decision. In this regard the Judge  recorded  that  the  only
       evidence he had before him relating to Ms Aslam's employment was
       her P45 and five payslips relating to an earlier employment with
       Comet, and  copies  of  her  bank  statements.  These  were  not
       sufficient to discharge the burden of proof and the  appeal  was
       dismissed.

    4. The grounds of appeal are  that  there  has  been  a  procedural
       impropriety. If the documents listed in the  determination  were
       indeed the only ones before the Judge then it  would  appear  he
       did not have the  Respondent's  bundle  or  the  two  additional
       appeal  bundles  submitted  by  the  Appellant  which  contained
       further evidence as to the Sponsor's employment situation at the
       date of decision.

    5. In granting permission to appeal to this Tribunal  Judge  Pooler
       of the  First-tier  Tribunal  noted  that  the  Tribunal  record
       indicates that the documents mentioned in the grounds of  appeal
       were indeed received by the  Tribunal  before  the  matter  went
       before Judge Munonyedi.  It is not clear whether those documents
       were before the Judge and he failed to take them  into  account,
       or whether they were not placed on the file before it was passed
       to him. Either way, there is an error of law. The file  contains
       a number of  relevant  documents  above  and  beyond  the  Comet
       payslips and P45. I therefore set the decision aside.

    6. At the hearing on the 30th June 2014  Mr  Usman  identified  the
       relevant documents  as  being  six  payslips  from  the  Central
       Compensation Office dated September 2012-February 2013, a letter
       from that organisation confirming  that  the  Sponsor  had  been
       employed there since August 2012 and that her salary was �25,000
       (these were all in the Respondent's bundle), a P60 for the  year
       ending April 2013, further payslips from March - May 2013,  bank
       statements  showing  these  salaries  deposited  in  Ms  Aslam's
       account.  Calculating back the Sponsor's  payslips  indicated  a
       gross annual salary of �18,630.    The  disparity  between  this
       figure and that cited  by  the  employer  in  their  letter  was
       accounted for by the  fact  that  Appendix  FM-SE  requires  the
       decision-maker to look back at previous employment, in this case
       Ms Aslam's lower  paid  work  at  Comet.  Whichever  figure  was
       correct, Ms  Johnstone  conceded  that  if  the  documents  were
       genuine, the Appellant's appeal must succeed.

    7. Ms Johnstone requested that the  Respondent  be  given  time  to
       conduct checks on the documents. As the matter had been a  paper
       case  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  Respondent   had   not
       considered this post-decision evidence. Mr  Usman  protested  by
       pointing out  that  these  documents  had  all  been  served  in
       compliance with directions and  that  the  Respondent  had  been
       given plenty of time to conduct verification checks.  Whilst  Mr
       Usman was correct  I  considered  it  appropriate  to  allow  Ms
       Johnstone time to verify the P60 with HMRC, leaving no room  for
       doubt  and  hopefully  facilitating  the  speedy  entry  of  the
       Appellant, already separated from his wife for  approaching  two
       years.  Ms Johnstone requested an adjournment of three weeks  in
       order to do this.

    8. Unfortunately the results of the verification  checks  were  not
       available when the hearing resumed on the 5th August. Mr McVeety
       requested yet more  time.  Mr  Muhammad  rightly  objected.  The
       Respondent has had an opportunity to conduct HMRC checks. It  is
       open to the Respondent to pursue  those  enquiries  and  if  the
       results are adverse to the Appellant it is in  the  Respondent's
       power to refuse to issue a visa pursuant to this determination.


Decisions

    9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law
       and it is set aside.

   10. I re-make the decision by allowing the appeal.
