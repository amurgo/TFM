Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr A. Pretzell and Mr J Collins (Counsel, instructed
                       by Sheikh & Co. Solicitors)
For the respondent:    Ms R. Brown and Mr Ouseley (Home Office Presenting
                       Officers)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    In 2003 the appellant, a citizen of Somalia born in 1930, applied  for
      entry clearance to the UK as the  dependant  of  his  wife  now  a  UK
      citizen but formerly a Somali national. The application  was  made  in
      about May 2003. It was refused on 30  November  2005.  An  appeal  was
      lodged on 20th December 2005.  The appellant's appeal was  allowed  by
      Immigration Judge Gibb in a determination promulgated on 13  September
      2006. The  respondent's  application  for  a  reconsideration  of  the
      successful appeal was granted by a  senior  immigration  judge  on  26
      September 2006.

2.    The appellant had fled Somalia and at the time of the application  was
      living in Ethiopia with his son. The appellant's appeal was considered
      with the appeal of his son, then aged 37, who had  also  been  refused
      entry clearance. At the hearing before the immigration  judge  it  was
      indicated on behalf  of  the  sponsor  that  that  appeal  was  to  be
      withdrawn. The immigration judge properly pointed out that the sponsor
      had no power to withdraw the appeal but, having considered the matter,
      the son's appeal was dismissed on the papers. No application is before
      this tribunal in relation to the son's case.

Factual background

3.    At the  time  of  the  application  in  April  2003,  it  appears  the
      appellant's wife (here called the sponsor) was in  receipt  of  income
      support. By the time of the hearing, and  to  date,  she  also  became
      entitled to disability living allowance.  It  is  not  entirely  clear
      precisely when the sponsor began receiving disability living allowance
      but Mr. Pretzell confirmed that this must have happened at  some  time
      between the date of the decision and the date of  the  hearing  before
      the immigration judge. At the date of the decision, the sponsor was in
      receipt of �91 per week.  At  the  date  of  the  hearing  before  the
      immigration judge, she was in  receipt  of  social  security  payments
      including disability living allowance of �211  per week.  In  addition
      to  disability  living  allowance  and  income  support,  the  sponsor
      currently receives housing benefit and council tax benefit. She  lives
      in a property of which she is the sole  tenant,  owned  by  a  housing
      trust. There have been conversion works to the property to provide for
      the sponsor's disabilities.

4.    The appellant has health problems and also suffers from a  disability.
      The medical evidence before the immigration judge (paragraph 14 of the
      Determination) shows that the appellant suffered from a peptic  ulcer,
      "external thrombosed hemorrhoids", depression and chronic pain in  his
      leg secondary to  an  amputation  below  the  left  ankle  joint.  The
      evidence does not suggest that either the appellant or his sponsor  is
      able to work, and indeed no such suggestion has been made.

5.    The immigration judge accepted that the sponsor sent  to  her  husband
      and son in Ethiopia between US$200 and US$300 per month. This  equated
      to between �123 and �184 per month, depending on  the  exchange  rate.
      The sponsor and the appellant have a  daughter  who  is  in  well-paid
      employment in London earning in 2005 �41,000 and now  after  promotion
      �50,000. The daughter gives her witness statement says �600 a month to
      support her father and brother  in  Ethiopia  monthly  and  the  judge
      accepted she pays �500 into an account for support of the family.

6.    A cousin of the appellant who  also  lives  in  England  supports  the
      appellant and his son in amounts which vary between �100 and �400  per
      month. The evidence accepted by the immigration  judge  suggests  that
      the appellant and his  son  are  maintained  in  Ethiopia  by  monthly
      remittances from the UK which at their lowest total �723 per month and
      at  their  highest  �1184  per  month.  The  son,  who  is  a  partial
      beneficiary of this support, is, as indicated,  in his thirties.

      The first Tribunal decision

7.     One  apparent  basis  for  the  refusal  by  the  respondent  of  the
      appellant's application was that the marriage  between  the  appellant
      and the sponsor was not subsisting. The immigration  judge  gave  full
      and clear reasons for rejecting that view. He made a finding that  the
      marriage was subsisting.

8.     Before  the  immigration  judge,  the   respondent's   representative
      conceded that there was adequate accommodation.

9.    The immigration judge noted that the  application  had  been  made  in
      2003 on the basis that, although the sponsor  (the  appellant's  wife)
      would not be able to support the first appellant, there was additional
      sponsorship from the daughter. He said that at  the  hearing  emphasis
      was placed on the sponsor's  benefit,  income  and  disability  living
      allowance and her ability to support the appellant. However,  he  took
      the view that "the correct approach is to look at the resources of the
      family as  a  whole.  This  was  the  way  that  the  application  was
      originally put forward and it is also the reality of  how  the  family
      have been supporting the first appellant in Ethiopia". The immigration
      judge concluded that the benefit income, the support from the daughter
      and some further support from a cousin taken together met the test for
      adequate maintenance in the Rules and so allowed the appeals.

Paragraph 281 of the Rules

10.   The respondent refers in the refusal of entry clearance  to  paragraph
      317 and 352 of the Rules. With the consent of all parties  the  appeal
      proceeded before the immigration judge and before us on the basis that
      the  applicable  rules  relating  to  this  appeal  are  contained  in
      paragraph 281 Rules (HC 395 as amended). The paragraph is as follows:

      281.  The requirements to be met by a person seeking  leave  to  enter
           the United Kingdom with a view to settlement as the  spouse  [or
           civil partner] of a person present and  settled  in  the  United
           Kingdom or who is  on  the  same  occasion  being  admitted  for
           settlement are that:
            (i)  (a) the applicant is married to [or the civil  partner  of]
                 a person present and settled in the United Kingdom  or  who
                 is on the same occasion being admitted for settlement; or
                 (b) the applicant is married to [or the civil  partner  of]
                 a person who has a right of abode in the United Kingdom  or
                 indefinite leave to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom
                 and is on the same occasion seeking admission to the United
                 Kingdom for the purposes of settlement and the parties were
                 married [or formed a civil partnership] at  least  4  years
                 ago, since  which  time  they  have  been  living  together
                 outside the United Kingdom; and
            (ii)       the  parties to the marriage have met; and
            (iii)      each of the parties intends to live permanently  with
                 the other as his or her spouse [or civil partner]  and  the
                 marriage [or civil partnership] is subsisting; and
            (iv) there will be adequate accommodation for  the  parties  and
                 any  dependants  without  recourse  to  public   funds   in
                 accommodation which they own or occupy exclusively; and
            (v)  the parties will be able to  maintain  themselves  and  any
                 dependents adequately without recourse to public funds; and


             (vi)  the  applicant  holds  a  valid  United  Kingdom    entry
                 clearance for entry in this capacity.

11.   For the purposes of this reconsideration, so far as relevant,  it  was
      accepted by all parties that the only requirement of paragraph 281  in
      issue was paragraph 281(v).

12.   It is common in the Rules to require a person seeking entry  clearance
      in  various  circumstances  to  show  that  they  can  be   adequately
      maintained without recourse to  public  funds.  The  wording  of  this
      provision in relation to children joining their parents  or  relatives
      has been considered by the Tribunal in AA (3rd party maintenance  R297
      (v)) Bangladesh [2005] UKAIT 00105.

13.   Paragraph 297 provides so far as relevant:

      297.  The requirements to be met by a person seeking indefinite  leave
           to enter the United as the child  of  a  parent,  parents  or  a
           relative present and settled or being admitted for settlement in
           the United Kingdom are that he: [...]
            (v)  can, and will, be  maintained  adequately  by  the  parent,
                 parents or relative the child is seeking to  join,  without
                 recourse to public funds;...

14.   The Tribunal in AA Bangladesh   concluded  in  relation  to  paragraph
      297(v):

            "It requires that the applicant for entry  clearance  'can,  and
           will, be maintained adequately by the  parent  (emphasis  added)
           the child  is  seeking  to  join...without  recourse  to  public
           funds'. We are satisfied that the use of  the  definite  article
           limits the class of person who can provide the  maintenance.  We
           regard the formulation as pointing clearly to a requirement that
           where a child is joining a parent under paragraph 297 it is that
           parent who must maintain that  child.  Third  party  support  by
           relatives or otherwise cannot satisfy the rule as it now is."

15.   Ms. Brown submitted that the immigration judge made an  error  of  law
      in the manner in which he analysed the requirement for maintenance  in
      this case. She submitted that the immigration judge was wrong to "look
      at the resources of the family as a whole" when deciding, as  he  did,
      that the appellant can be maintained adequately  without  recourse  to
      public funds. Ms Brown argued by analogy with AA Bangladesh  that  the
      maintenance has to be by  "the  parties"  alone.  Hence,  third  party
      support cannot be relied on. The immigration judge was wrong to accept
      that the monies from the daughter and the cousin could be  taken  into
      account. The sponsor, it was argued,  only  had  her  social  security
      benefits. They were provided for  the  sponsor  alone.  This  was  not
      adequate for the maintenance of two persons, here  the  appellant  and
      the sponsor.

16.   Ms Brown further relied on  KA  (and  others)  Pakistan  [2006]  UKAIT
      00065 where the Tribunal said at paragraph 21:

            "The view that the wording of paragraph 194, and  other  similar
           paragraphs in the Rules, excludes third party support appears to
           be implicit in decision of the Tribunal in [AA Bangladesh].  For
           this reason we should have found that the support offered by the
           third party could not be taken into  account  as  assisting  the
           first appellant who satisfied the  requirements  of  the  Rules,
           even if we  had  found  that  such  support  were  realistically
           available."

17.   We were also referred to the  Immigration  Directorates'  Instructions
      (IDIs) under Chapter 8, sections 1 and 2, in relation to  spouses  and
      civil partners, where at Annex F 5.1 it is said that maintenance  from
      members of the families of spouses is not  acceptable  as  "the  rules
      require the couple to be able to support themselves and any dependents
      from their own resources". This IDI is of course in no way binding  on
      the Tribunal but it is an indication of the  way  in  which  paragraph
      281(v) has been applied by the Secretary of State and entry  clearance
      officers.

18.   Mr Pretzell on behalf of the appellant  argued  that  the  wording  of
      paragraph 297(v) and  281(v)  is  different.   Paragraph  281(v)  only
      refers to "the parties will be able to maintain  themselves",  whereas
      paragraph 297(v) provides that the child "can, and will, be maintained
      adequately by the parent". There  must,  it  was  contended,  be  some
      reason for  the  difference  in  the  wording.  That  reason,  it  was
      contended, is that paragraph 281(v) is intended to  allow  support  by
      third parties in addition to support that "the parties", i.e. here the
      appellant and the sponsor, can provide  for  themselves.  Reliance  is
      placed on AK and others (Bangladesh)  [2006]  UKAIT  0069.  There  the
      Tribunal reached no conclusion as to whether AA Bangladesh ought to be
      applied in that case, which also concerned paragraph  281(v).  In  the
      particular case they said at paragraph 51:

            "Vague and unquantified expressions of goodwill  are  inadequate
           to enable an applicant for settlement to show  the  availability
           of adequate maintenance (or indeed accommodation)  even  if  the
           rules allow third party support in principle."

            (our emphasis)

      Mr. Pretzell relied on the final (underlined) phrase in that  sentence
      to argue that the Tribunal in AK and others left open the  possibility
      that third party support may be permitted under paragraph 281  of  the
      Rules.

19.   We  do  not  accept  that  third  party  support  is  permitted  under
      paragraph 281 of the Rules. The phraseology  of  paragraph  281(v)  is
      widely used throughout the Rules (see paragraphs 284, 290, and  295A).
      In our judgment, the phrase "the parties  will  be  able  to  maintain
      themselves" refers to the individuals themselves and does  not  permit
      of the importation of third party support to satisfy  the  requirement
      of the rule. The use of the definite article "the"  relating  that  to
      the parties reinforces our view and is supported  by  this  Tribunal's
      reasoning in AA (Bangladesh) with regard to paragraph 297.

20.    The  Rules  make  specific  provision  for  a  very  wide  range   of
      circumstances under which individuals seeking entry clearance  may  be
      granted such clearance.  Paragraph 281(v) and  paragraph  297(v)  both
      require, in our view, that the resources referred to must be those  of
      the parties alone in 281(v) and of the parents alone in 297(v).  There
      are additional and  sound  child  protection  reasons  why  297(v)  is
      properly interpreted as held in AA Bangladesh. Under paragraph 281(v),
      as here, the purpose of the rule  is  to  facilitate  the  reunion  of
      spouses who  are  expected  to  maintain  themselves  from  their  own
      resources.

21.   Indeed, the structure and  wording  of  paragraph  281  of  the  Rules
      focuses the requirements of the Rules on the two individuals who  wish
      to benefit from them; the spouse or civil partner with rights to be in
      the UK, and the spouse or civil partner who seeks to join that person.
       The parties  must  have  met  (281(ii),  they  must  intend  to  live
      permanently with each  other  and  the  marriage  must  be  subsisting
      (281(iii).  The accommodation must be adequate and owned and  occupied
      exclusively by one  or  other  of  the  parties  to  the  relationship
      (281(iv).  This all points clearly to the need  for  the  two  persons
      involved to satisfy the Rules  personally  without  reference  to  any
      third parties. So with maintenance. Paragraph 281(v) in our  judgement
      requires the resources to be those of the parties alone.

22.   We are aware of the  view,  widely  supported  by  those  representing
      appellants, that because the Rules are silent on whether  third  party
      support is permissible,  it  must  necessarily  be  so.  We  take  the
      opposite view. The issue of maintenance is of importance  in  many  of
      the immigration Rules. Had it been intended that third  party  support
      should satisfy a maintenance requirement we would expect the rules  to
      say so and to set out the way in which such maintenance might  satisfy
      the requirement. Mr. Pretzell also relied on paragraph 21 of  KA  (and
      others) , suggesting that the Tribunal  appeared  to  accept  in  that
      paragraph that third party support may be  permitted  under  paragraph
      281. We do not agree.  When  read  properly,  it  is  clear  that  the
      Tribunal did not think it necessary to decide the issue in that  case,
      because it was able the decide the case on other grounds - i.e.  that,
      even if third party support was permitted  under  paragraph  281,  the
      Tribunal found that it was not realistically available in that case.

23.   Reliance is also often placed on the following remarks  of  Collins  J
      in R v SSHD ex parte Arman Ali [2000]INLR 89 at 101 and following)
           "......... Accordingly, the Rules would not in  my  view  be  in
           accordance with Article 8  if  they  were  construed  so  as  to
           exclude a spouse when his or her admission would not affect  the
           economic well-being of the country because  there  would  be  no
           recourse to public funds or any other detriment caused by it.
           I come finally to the construction of the relevant Rules, namely
           H.C. 395. Since it is clear that their implementation can, given
           circumstances which are not likely to be  particularly  unusual,
           produce a breach of Article 8,  they  should,  if  possible,  be
           given a construction which will avoid such a breach.
           The wording of Rule 281(vi) does not in terms suggest  that  the
           ability to maintain must be from  the  parties'  own  resources.
           Other rules do.
           If a rich relation, or a  benefactor  is  willing  and  able  to
           maintain a family in this country so that there is  no  need  to
           have recourse to public funds, I see no reason in principle  why
           that family should be kept apart. The purpose  of  the  rule  is
           quite clearly met and the natural meaning of the  language  used
           is consistent with the construction I have espoused.
           I do not doubt that it will be rare for applicants to be able to
           satisfy an Entry Clearance Officer, the Secretary of State or an
           adjudicator that long term maintenance by a third party will  be
           provided so that there will be no recourse to public funds.  But
           whether or not such long term support  will  be  provided  is  a
           question of fact to be determined on the evidence."
24.   In our view, Arman Ali should no longer be relied upon to support  the
      proposition that third party support is permitted  if  the  underlying
      purpose of avoiding recourse to public funds is  achieved.  This  case
      was decided prior to the implementation of the Human Rights  Act  1998
      when domestic human rights jurisdiction was (in relative  terms,  when
      compared with the situation today) in its infancy.  The  Human  Rights
      Act 1998 now applies. Section 3 provides that, in  so  far  as  it  is
      possible to do so, primary  legislation  and  subordinate  legislation
      must be read and given effect in a way which is  compatible  with  the
      Convention rights. For the reasons  we  have  given  in  paragraph  21
      above, the wording of paragraph 281 as a whole does  clearly  indicate
      that the ability to maintain must be from the parties' own  resources.
      We are of the view that we are unable to interpret words "the parties"
      in paragraph 281(v) in isolation from the clear meaning  of  the  same
      words in other parts of the same rule. The words "the parties" in each
      part of paragraph 281 should be given their natural meaning, which  is
      the proper approach to their interpretation: see the House  of  Lords'
      judgment in Alexander v. IAT [1982] IAR 392. Unless the Appellant  can
      establish that paragraph 281  as  expressed  is  inconsistent  with  a
      Convention right, section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 will not come
      into play (see paragraphs 34 and 35 of KP (Para  317:  mothers-in-law)
      India [2006] KAIT 00093). We are aware that  there  are  a  number  of
      conflicting Tribunal cases  as  to  whether  third  party  support  is
      permitted in spouse applications (see paragraph  11.54  of  the  sixth
      edition of Macdonald's Immigration Law and Practice, to which we  were
      not referred). We did not have the benefit  of  hearing  the  parties'
      submissions on those cases but, as far as we can see,  these  are  old
      cases, pre-dating Arman Ali and they are also cases which fail to take
      into account the proper approach to the application of  section  3  as
      set out in KP India.

25.   Accordingly, the  immigration  judge  erred  in  law  in  taking  into
      account the financial  support  provided  by  the  sponsor's  and  the
      appellant's daughter and the cousin.

26.   There was a further error of law in the immigration  judge's  decision
      to allow the appeal under the  Rules  as  he  took  into  account  the
      sponsor's receipt  of  disability  living  allowance,  which  she  was
      receiving as at the date of the hearing but not as at the date of  the
      decision at which time she was receiving income support. By taking the
      sponsor's disability living allowance into  account,  the  immigration
      judge  erred  in  law  because  section  85(5)  of  the   Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as amended (the 2002 Act) obliged  him
      to  determine  the  appeal  by   reference   to   the   "circumstances
      appertaining as at the date of the decision."  The immigration judge's
      error in taking into account the sponsor's disability living allowance
      was material to his decision to allow the appeal under the  Rules  for
      the reasons we give below.

27.    Accordingly,  it  is  necessary  for  us  to  consider  whether   the
      circumstances appertaining  at the date of the decision were such that
      the appellant satisfied the maintenance requirement in paragraph  281.
      This requires us to consider the issue of the adequacy of  maintenance
      in this case. We were referred to MN Pakistan [2002] UK IAT 01369. The
      IAT in that case relied on a  passage  from  Panaich  (00/TH/0072)  as
      follows:

            "19.  In our judgment, when benefits are paid  to  a  person  in
           respect of a disability, it  is  simply  improper  to  conclude,
           without more, that that person would be maintained adequately if
           he or she made their benefits  available  to  someone  else.  Of
           course, it may be the case that if another person  is  available
           to share the task of caring, the  costs  will  be  reduced...but
           that simply cannot  be  assumed;  it  must  be  the  subject  of
           evidence. Different people  will  be  able  to  offer  different
           things, from occasional  transport  (thus  perhaps  saving  taxi
           fares) upwards. Without such evidence, it appears to us that  it
           should normally be presumed that the adequate maintenance of the
           recipient of the benefits requires the whole of those benefits."

28.   We agree with that  view.  In  our  judgment  the  benefits  a  person
      receives must themselves be deemed to be  "adequate  maintenance"  for
      that person alone. Parliament decides, in the main on an annual basis,
      on the adequate level of benefit for those living in this country  who
      are entitled to and require state assistance. It  would  be  wrong  in
      principle, in our judgment, to accept that benefits which  are  deemed
      to be adequate for one person alone ought to be accepted  as  adequate
      for the maintenance of two persons in order to facilitate  entry  into
      the UK for the second person. The inevitable, and undesirable,  result
      would be two persons living significantly below the poverty line.

29.   It was said in  KA  and  others  (adequacy  of  maintenance)  Pakistan
      [2006] UKAIT 0065 at paragraph 8:-

            "It perhaps does not necessarily follow  that  in  order  to  be
           adequately  maintained  one  has  to  have  resources  at  least
           equivalent to those which would be  available  to  a  family  on
           income support.  But there are very good reasons for taking that
           view.  A family of British (or EU)  citizens  resident  in  this
           country will not have less than that  level.   It  is  extremely
           undesirable that the Rules should be interpreted in such  a  way
           as to envisage immigrant  families  existing  (and  hence  being
           required to exist, because  social  security  benefits  are  not
           available to them) on resources less than those which  would  be
           available  through  the  social  security  system   to   citizen
           families.  To do so is to  encourage  the  view  that  immigrant
           families need less, or can be expected to live on less........"

      We agree with and support this view.

30.   Adequate maintenance  and  social  security  benefit  levels  for  the
      sponsor and the appellant living together in the UK, were they able to
      claim such benefits jointly as opposed to the sponsor alone, would  be
      significantly above the figure received by the sponsor as at the  date
      of the decision. Two persons living together as husband and wife where
      there is no restriction on claiming would receive  significantly  more
      benefit from public funds than does one  person.  It  is  that  figure
      which must be used as the benchmark for deciding whether  the  sponsor
      would be able to maintain the appellant adequately without recourse to
      public funds. In our judgment, the sponsor's income  support  was  not
      adequate as at the date of the decision to support the  appellant  and
      the sponsor within the meaning of paragraph  281(v)of  the  Rules.  We
      accept (because the immigration judge accepted) that the  sponsor  was
      sending her husband and son in Ethiopia between US$200 and US$300  per
      month which equated to an exchange rate  between  �123  and  �184  per
      month. This is a significant sum. If we were to accept on  this  basis
      that the appellant would be adequately maintained in  the  UK  without
      recourse to public funds, this would result in both the appellant  and
      the sponsor living significantly below the minimum level of income for
      a couple on income support.

31.   Even if it had been  open  to  the  immigration  judge  to  take  into
      account the sponsor's disability living allowance (which  he  was  not
      because of the provisions of section 85(5) of the 2002 Act),  he  fell
      into error by equating the money the sponsor sent to the appellant for
      his support in Ethiopia to the funds properly available  in  order  to
      satisfy   the  maintenance  requirement.  Although  disability  living
      allowance is set at what may be seen as a generous level by comparison
      with income support, the  reason  for  the  allowance  (which  is  not
      treated as the individual's income for tax purposes) is to enable  the
      individual  to  provide  for  his  or  her  needs  arising  from   the
      disability. Such enhanced benefits are awarded  out  of  necessity  so
      that the needs of the claimant can be met.  As the Tribunal said in MK
      (Adequacy of maintenance -  disabled  sponsor)  Somalia  [2007]  UKAIT
      00028, where a sponsor has disabilities  it  should  be  assumed  that
      enhanced benefits, such  as  a  higher  rate  of  Income  Support,  or
      Disability Living Allowance, have been awarded out  of  necessity  and
      are not available to support dependants coming from abroad.

32.   We appreciate that the result of our decision may  be  that  very  few
      individuals may be able to satisfy the maintenance requirements  where
      it is proposed that the sponsor's income support or disability  living
      allowance  be  used  to  provide  maintenance  for   the   applicants.
      Nevertheless, we are satisfied that this interpretation  is  not  only
      fair but necessary in  order  to  ensure  that  all  sections  of  the
      community have the means to benefit from substantially the same living
      standards when they have to depend on social security support.

33.   Accordingly, in our view, the immigration judge  materially  erred  in
      law in concluding that paragraph 281(v) was satisfied  in  this  case.
      Social security benefits provided by the State for the support of  one
      person only cannot be regarded as adequate  to  support  two  persons.
      Nor can third party support be relied on to create an  "adequacy"  for
      the reasons set out above.

Article 8

34.   We indicated our view  at  the  end  of  the  first  hearing  of  this
      reconsideration case that the immigration judge's  decision  to  allow
      the appeal under the Rules was wrong  in  law  and  could  not  stand.
      However, after further consideration we invited the parties to  attend
      at a reconvened hearing to make submissions on the Article 8 rights of
      the appellant in this case.  Mr Collins and Mr Ouseley  were  able  to
      attend in place of Mr Pretzel and  Ms  Brown  and  both  made  further
      helpful submissions.

35.   The immigration judge concluded that he should allow the appeal  under
      the Rules.  But he also said (paragraph 23 of the Determination):-

            "In my view there  are  strong  compassionate  factors  in  this
           case, and there would be strong Article  8  grounds,  given  the
           overall circumstances. This is a family that have been separated
           by war, and that have suffered considerably, both physically and
           psychologically. As it  is,  however,  it  is  clear  that  they
           succeed under the Rules,.................. For these reasons,  I
           base my decision on the Rules, and will say not say  more  about
           Article 8. This  also  reflects  the  way  the  appeal  was  put
           forwarded on their behalf."

36.   Mr Ouseley argued that there are no factual findings  with  regard  to
      the  appellant's  Article  8  claim  because  the  immigration   judge
      considered that it was not necessary for him to  consider  Article  8.
      For example, there was no finding as to whether there was family life.
      Accordingly, Mr. Ouseley submitted that it would be necessary for  the
      Tribunal to reconsider the Article 8 at a second-stage reconsideration
      so that relevant factual findings on the evidence could  be  made.  In
      response to this point, Mr. Collins submitted that there was  no  need
      for  the  Tribunal  to  adjourn   this   case   for   a   second-stage
      reconsideration to take place because the Tribunal had the benefit  of
      sufficient findings.

37.   In the alternative, Mr. Ouseley  argued  that  the  situation  of  the
      appellant could not be described  as  truly  exceptional  outside  the
      Rules as required by Huang  using the judgement of the Court of Appeal
      in his submissions made before the decision of the House of  Lords  in
      that case. The appellant's rights to family  life  could  continue  in
      Ethiopia.  The sponsor could travel  there  and  the  parties  to  the
      marriage can always communicate by phone and letter.  Paragraph 281 is
      Article 8 compliant.  Such  health  problems  as  there  are  are  not
      exceptional.

38.   In response, Mr Collins submitted that the sponsor wife  has  been  in
      the UK since 1994 and is now a citizen.  Five of  her  eight  children
      are in the UK.  She had been advised by her solicitors to  wait  until
      she was granted British citizenship before she applied for her husband
      to join her and she made the application when that had happened.   The
      appellant, her husband, is not in good health, physically or mentally.
       He has stomach problems and is depressed and  disabled,  having  lost
      the lower part of his leg.  His daughter is willing to support him for
      as long as it takes.  He needs his wife's support and she  herself  is
      not well.

39.   We put to the parties the following argument: that, if  the  appellant
      were to lodge an application under paragraph 317 as a dependent of his
      daughter, he might satisfy the  maintenance  requirement  because  his
      daughter's earnings appear to be sufficient.  She is  in  particularly
      well-paid employment and is prepared to support him indefinitely.  She
      is not married and has no children. Having  regard  to  the  Court  of
      Appeal's guidance on  the issue of delay in HB (Ethiopia)  and  others
      [2006] EWCA Civ 1713 and the appellant's and  the  sponsor's  advanced
      ages, we questioned whether the appellant ought to be expected to make
      a further entry clearance application as a dependent of  his  daughter
      under paragraph 317 of the  Rules.  The  appellant's  application  for
      entry clearance in the instant appeal was made in about May  2003  but
      the decision was only made on 30 November 2005 - a delay of 2 � years.
       This may be viewed as a substantial delay given the advanced ages  of
      the sponsor and the appellant.

40.   We asked Mr. Ouseley whether  an  entry  clearance  application  under
      paragraph 317 would succeed. In response, Mr.  Ouseley  said  that  he
      could not assist us because he did not  have  the  file.  Mr.  Collins
      agreed with the points we made.

Discussion of Article 8

41.   We agree with Mr. Collins that it is not necessary  for  further  oral
      evidence to be given in order to enable us to determine the Article  8
      claim. The immigration judge accepted the evidence  which  was  before
      him. We can proceed on the basis of that evidence, and  draw  our  own
      findings of fact.

42.   The first issue we need to decide is  whether  there  is  family  life
      within Article 8 (1). We remind ourselves that this must be decided on
      the basis of the circumstances appertaining as  at  the  date  of  the
      decision and on the  standard  of  a  balance  of  probabilities.  The
      circumstances appertaining as at the date  of  the  decision  are  not
      different to the circumstances currently  existing,  other  than  with
      regard to the fact that the sponsor began receiving disability  living
      allowance after the date of the decision. This, in turn, reflects upon
      the difference in the state of the sponsor's health at those times.

43.   The immigration judge found that the appellant and  his  wife  have  a
      subsisting marriage and intend to live together  permanently.  In  our
      view, this is +-equivalent to a finding that there was family life  at
      the date of the decision. On the balance  of  probabilities,  we  draw
      that finding from the immigration judge's Determination.

44.   We now consider whether, in the circumstances as at the  date  of  the
      decision  and  on  the  balance  of  probabilities,  the  respondent's
      decision would have consequences of such  gravity  as  to  potentially
      engage the operation of Article 8. Since the appellant does  not  have
      legal status in Ethiopia,  it is more likely than not that the sponsor
      would not be able to live with him permanently there. Accordingly,  if
      the decision is maintained, the probability is that they would not  be
      able to enjoy their family life with each other by  living  physically
      together. They were separated because of the civil war in Somalia,  as
      long ago as 1994 and have already suffered hardship. We are  satisfied
      that the probability of the appellant and the sponsor not  being  able
      to enjoy their family  life  with  each  other  by  living  physically
      together does amount, in the  context  of  a  relationship  between  a
      husband and a wife who are already  of  advanced  ages  and  who  were
      separated by the war, to a consequence of such gravity as  potentially
      to engage the operation of Article 8.

45.   We are satisfied, and it is not  in  dispute,  that  any  interference
      (or, more correctly, lack of respect) would be in accordance with  the
      law because, apart from the application which is the subject  of  this
      appeal, the appellant had no other right to enter this country on  the
      circumstances appertaining as at the date of the decision. Any lack of
      respect would be in pursuit of  a  legitimate  public  aim,  i.e.  the
      maintenance of a fair and effective system of immigration control.
46.   We turn to the main issue of proportionality.  We did not consider  it
      necessary to reconvene the parties to address us on the report of  the
      Appellate Committee in Huang because the Appellate Committee explained
      that it is still expected that only a very  small  minority  of  cases
      would succeed under Article 8. That was the  position  before,  albeit
      that the result was achieved through the concept  of  "exceptionality"
      as explained by the Court of Appeal in Huang.
47.   Accordingly although "exceptionality" is not in itself a  legal  test,
      the evaluation of  the  evidence  in  order  to  answer  the  ultimate
      question - i.e. of identifying the relevant factors on  each  side  of
      the scale - and the mechanics of deciding the importance to  be  given
      to considerations in favour of the decision and the  consideration  on
      the other side of the scale are the  same  as  they  were  before  the
      Appellate Committee of the House of Lords  delivered  its  opinion  in
      Huang. In effect,  this  is  because  it  was  always  the  case  that
      immigration judges were guided to the effect  that   "decisions  taken
      pursuant to the  lawful  operation  of  immigration  control  will  be
      proportionate in all save  a  small  minority  of  exceptional  cases,
      identifiable only on a case by case basis." R v SSHD ex  parte  Razgar
      [2004]UKHL 27. It is not the case, in our judgement,  that  applicants
      will find it easier to succeed under Article 8 than was previously the
      case.  Immigration  judges  when  assessing  proportionality  must  be
      careful to state clearly that their task is to weigh all the competing
      considerations  and  give  due  and   considerable   weight   to   the
      considerations in favour of the decision appealed against. They should
      then answer the proportionality question by stating whether they  find
      that the case they are dealing with, although it is not covered by the
      Rules and supplementary  directions,  is  entitled  to  succeed  under
      Article 8. The expectation remains that such cases will  form  a  very
      small minority.
48.   We will turn now to consider the  issue  of  proportionality  in  this
      particular case. We have  given  very  careful  consideration  to  the
      argument we posed to the parties  and  which  we  have  summarised  at
      paragraph 41 above. We have decided, on reflection, that this argument
      does not assist the appellant. This is for two  reasons.  Firstly,  an
      application (if made) by the appellant  under  paragraph  317  as  the
      dependent relative of his daughter could not succeed because he cannot
      bring himself within 317 (i), which states:
      "317. The requirements to be met by a person seeking indefinite  leave
           to enter  or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  the  parent,
           grandparent or other dependent relative of a person present  and
           settled in the United Kingdom are that the person:
           (i) is related to a person present and  settled  in  the  United
           Kingdom in one of the following ways:
           (a) mother or grandmother who is a widow aged 65 years or  over;
           or
           (b) father or grandfather who is a  widower  aged  65  years  or
           over; or
           (c) parents or grandparents travelling together of whom at least
           one is aged 65 or over; or
           (d) a parent or grandparent aged 65 or over  who  has  remarried
           but cannot look to the spouse or children of the second marriage
           for financial support; and  where  the  person  settled  in  the
           United Kingdom is able and willing to  maintain  the  parent  or
           grandparent and any spouse or child of the second  marriage  who
           would be admissible as a dependant; or
           (e) a parent or grandparent under the age of 65 if living  alone
           outside the United Kingdom in the most exceptional compassionate
           circumstances and  mainly  dependent  financially  on  relatives
           settled in the United Kingdom; or
           (f) the son, daughter, sister, brother, uncle or aunt  over  the
           age of 18 if living alone outside the United Kingdom in the most
           exceptional compassionate  circumstances  and  mainly  dependent
           financially on relatives settled  in  the  United  Kingdom;  and
           ..........."
49.   As the appellant is over 65 years of age and not a  widower,  he  does
      not fall within paragraph 317(i) (b), (c), (d) or (f). On the face  of
      it, he does not fall within paragraph 317(i)(e) either because of  his
      age, although the guidance in the IDIs (Chapter 8, Section 6, Annex V,
      paragraph 1) may well mean that his age is not in  fact  a  bar  under
      paragraph 317(i)(e). We express no concluded view on this  as  we  did
      not hear any argument in this respect.  However, paragraph  3  of  the
      Determination  shows  that,  as  at  the  date  of   the   appellant's
      application for entry clearance in May 2003, he was  living  with  his
      son who was taking care of him on  a  daily  basis.   The  appellant's
      daughter's witness statement which was before  the  immigration  judge
      dated 4 September 2006 (paragraph  12  on  page  25  of  the  appeal's
      bundle) shows that the appellant's son was continuing  to  look  after
      him on  a   daily  basis  at  the  date  of  the  hearing  before  the
      immigration judge. Accordingly, the appellant is not  "living  alone".
      We take further support from paragraph 8 of  the  Determination  which
      shows that Mr. Pretzell informed the immigration judge that one of the
      reasons why the appellant's son's appeal was not  pursued  before  the
      immigration judge was that,  even  if  it  could  be  shown  that  the
      appellant's son would be left living alone if the  appellant  were  to
      join the sponsor in the United Kingdom, there was  still  insufficient
      evidence that the son would be  living  in  exceptional  compassionate
      circumstances. Whilst Counsel's submissions are not  evidence,  it  is
      indicative of the circumstances remaining the same at the date of  the
      hearing before the immigration judge (i.e. that the appellant and  his
      son were living together at that time).
50.   Secondly, and in any event, the bundle of case-law relied upon by  Mr.
      Collins on the second hearing date before us  includes  the  Court  of
      Appeal's judgment in SB (Bangladesh) v. SSHD [2007]  EWCA  Civ  28  in
      which Lord Justice Ward said (at paragraphs 21  to  24  and  paragraph
      36):
      "21.  .................. whether or not the  applicant  would  satisfy
           the requirements for entry clearance was not a matter which  the
           [Tribunal] ought to have taken into account". Although there are
           arguments (and  first  instance  decisions)  which  support  the
           opposite view, that statement seems to be right as a  matter  of
           principle, in terms of fairness and good practice,  and  in  the
           light of authority.
      22.   So far as principle is  concerned,  the  issue  of  whether  the
           applicant satisfied the requirements of  paragraph  246  of  the
           Immigration Rules would be for an  entry  clearance  officer  in
           Bangladesh to determine, if and when an application  under  that
           paragraph is made. In the  absence  of  a  requirement  to  that
           effect, it is not an appropriate issue for  determination,  when
           no such application has been made,  by  a  tribunal  deciding  a
           different question, at a different time, in a different country,
           and in different circumstances.  It  would  also  seem  somewhat
           paradoxical if the stronger an appellant's  perceived  case  for
           entry clearance under the Immigration Rules the more  likely  he
           or she is to  be  removed.  Yet,  subject  to  the  first  point
           mentioned in paragraph [20] above, on the basis of the reasoning
           of the Tribunal in this  case,  that  would  be  the  inevitable
           consequence.
      23.   As to practicality, it would be unfortunate, in  terms  of  time
           effort and expense, if a tribunal, when deciding whether a claim
           for leave to remain was  truly  exceptional,  had  to  consider,
           almost as a matter  of  course,  how  likely  an  appellant,  if
           removed from the United  Kingdom,  would  be  to  succeed  on  a
           subsequent putative application for entry clearance to come back
           to this country. Yet, as we see it, such an exercise would  have
           to be carried out in many, possibly most, appeals of the present
           type, if that issue was potentially relevant. And,  if  such  an
           exercise is carried out, it is hard to see how a tribunal is  to
           decide the weight or effect of such a factor if it decides  that
           the prospects of success of such an  application  to  enter  are
           debatable or speculative.
        1. There is also a real risk of unfairness to an appellant if  such
           a factor is taken into account. Thus,  the  views  expressed  in
           paragraphs [66] and [67] by the Tribunal in this case  may  turn
           out to be wrong, either because an entry clearance officer takes
           a different view of  the  facts  or  the  law,  or  because  the
           Immigration Rules change, or because the facts change."
51.   The effect of the SB (Bangladesh) case is that we would err in law  by
      taking into account an irrelevant matter  if  we  were  to  take  into
      account, when deciding proportionality, whether  the  appellant  would
      succeed if he were to make a further entry  clearance  application  on
      another basis.  This principle survives notwithstanding  the  reliance
      in the case on  the  Court  of  Appeal's  guidance  on  the  issue  of
      proportionality in Huang. By the same analogy, it would be an error of
      law for an immigration judge, when deciding proportionality,  to  take
      into account the possibility of the appellant  being  unsuccessful  if
      he/she were to make an entry clearance application from abroad.

52.   The only reason  the  appellant's  appeal  under  the  Rules  must  be
      dismissed is because third party support is  not  permitted.  However,
      the fact that the appellant "nearly  qualified"  under  the  Rules  or
      "just missed" qualifying under the Rules does not mean that his is one
      of the small minority of cases entitled to succeed  under  Article  8.
      Such a conclusion (without more) would  lead  to  insufficient  weight
      being given to the need to maintain effective immigration control.  It
      is now no more than a relevant factor. In  the  case  of  applications
      under paragraph 281 of the Rules,  the  spouse  or  civil  partner  is
      expected  to  satisfy  the  maintenance  requirement  from  their  own
      resources. Article 8 cannot be used as a  means  to  get  around  that
      requirement.
53.   Whilst the respondent's delay of 2 �-years in reaching a  decision  in
      this case  is a relevant factor, it must have very substantial effects
      if it is to influence the outcome - see paragraph 24 (v) of the  Court
      of Appeal's judgment in HB (Ethiopia) and others [2006] EWCA Civ  1713
      - because the appellant does not have a potential substantive right of
      entry under the Rules or any policy. Since  he  was  not  entitled  to
      succeed under the Rules, the delay will have deprived him of  nothing,
      other than that  his  Article  8  claim  would  have  been  determined
      earlier. This guidance in HB (Ethiopia) survives  notwithstanding  the
      reliance in the case on the Court of Appeal's guidance on the issue of
      proportionality in Huang.
54.   Immigration judges are often urged to  take  into  consideration,  and
      give weight to in the applicant's favour, the  fact  the  individual's
      living conditions are poor, with  poor  accommodation,  little  or  no
      medical facilities,  no education,  no  legal  status  etc.  With  the
      exception of legal status which has a  bearing  on  the  enjoyment  of
      family life (because the lack of status would generally mean that  the
      sponsor and the applicant are unable  to  enjoy  family  life  in  the
      country of residence of the applicant) the general  living  conditions
      of applicants will carry very little weight. In entry clearance cases,
      the state's obligation is a positive one to facilitate family life. It
      is difficult to see how an individual's living conditions can have any
      real bearing on the ultimate question which needs  to  be  answered  -
      i.e. whether family life will be prejudiced in a  manner  sufficiently
      serious as to amount to a breach of  fundamental  right  protected  by
      Article 8.  Any argument to that effect must be properly supported  by
      clear and cogent evidence showing precisely how the applicant's living
      conditions prejudices the enjoyment of family life, or that it does so
      sufficiently seriously as to amount a breach of Article 8. Suggestions
      that the applicant's living conditions distress the family in  the  UK
      in such a way as to prejudice the enjoyment of family life  should  be
      supported by medical evidence if it is said that the distress felt  is
      so severe as to defeat the state's interest in immigration control.
55.   Turning to the other specific facts of this case,  the  appellant  and
      his family have been separated by war and  they  have  suffered,  both
      physically and psychologically. At  the  date  of  the  decision,  the
      appellant was already of advanced years. The accepted evidence is that
      he was in poor health (see paragraph 4 above). The respondent's  delay
      is a  relevant  factor.  The  appellant  and  his  son  live  in  poor
      accommodation, although this factor can only carry little  weight.  In
      any event, they receive by way of financial support from the  sponsor,
      her daughter and a cousin a sum between  �700  and  something  over  a
      �1100 a month - which is a not inconsiderable sum. The appellant lives
      with and has support from his son  in  Ethiopia.  There  is  telephone
      contact between the appellant and  his  wife.  The  refusal  of  entry
      clearance  means that he will not, at present, be  able  to  join  his
      wife in the UK. He did not (and presumably still does  not)  have  any
      legal status in Ethiopia, the consequence of which may be that he  and
      the sponsor are not able at present to  enjoy  family  life  by  being
      together on any permanent basis in Ethiopia. On the  other  hand,  the
      circumstances appertaining as the date of the decision were  that  the
      sponsor was able to travel. She was not then in receipt of  disability
      living allowance and (paragraph  15  of  the  Determination)  she  had
      travelled to Kenya and the United Arab Emirates  in  2004  before  the
      date of the decision but had not gone to Ethiopia to see her  husband.
      On  the  findings  of  the  immigration   judge,   the   circumstances
      appertaining as at the date of the decision were that, notwithstanding
      the physical separation, the appellant was enjoying family  life  with
      his family in the United Kingdom of sufficient quality  as  to  engage
      Article 8 (1). In other words, he is not without any family life  with
      them at all. In addition, he was receiving the support and comfort  of
      his son, albeit that he was separated from the rest of his  family  in
      the United Kingdom. That fact must help to ameliorate  the  difficulty
      experienced by the appellant, the sponsor  and  the  remaining  family
      members in the  United  Kingdom  of  continuing  separation  from  the
      appellant, as must the knowledge that  the  remaining  son  /  sibling
      would not be left alone in Ethiopia.   We  also  have  regard  to  the
      considerations we have described above in favour  of  the  decision  -
      importantly,  the  maintenance  of  immigration   control   which   is
      "workable, predictable, consistent, fair and effective so as to ensure
      that it is not perceived as unduly  porous".  We  accord  considerable
      weight to the consideration in favour of the  decision  of  the  entry
      clearance officer being upheld.
56.   Having carefully considered all of  the  competing  considerations  in
      this case in the exercise of our judicial task, we have  answered  the
      ultimate question in favour of the decision being upheld, and  against
      the appellant. We find that this is not one of the very small minority
      of  cases  which,  although  it  is  not  covered  by  the  Rules  and
      supplementary directions, is entitled to succeed under Article 8.
Summary
57.   We summarise our main conclusions as follows:
      (i)   Third party support is not permitted under paragraph  281(v)  of
          the Rules. Arman Ali should no longer be followed.
      (ii)  As the Tribunal said in MK (Adequacy of maintenance  -  disabled
          sponsor)  Somalia  [2007]  UKAIT  00028,  where  a  sponsor   has
          disabilities it should be assumed that enhanced benefits, such as
          a higher rate of Income Support, or Disability Living  Allowance,
          have been awarded out of  necessity  and  are  not  available  to
          support dependants coming from abroad.
      (iii) When deciding the issue of proportionality in Article  8  cases:


            (a)  it would be an error of law for an immigration judge,  when
               deciding proportionality, to take  into  account  the  likely
               success  or  otherwise  of  a   different   entry   clearance
               application by the applicant;
            (b)   in  entry  clearance  cases,  the  respondent's  delay  in
               making a decision is unlikely  to  carry  more  than  minimal
               weight, even if it is a relevant factor; and
            (c)  in general terms, an  applicant's  poor  living  conditions
               abroad will not have any real  bearing  on  the  question  of
               whether his article 8 rights will be breached  by  a  refusal
               of entry clearance.
Decision
58.   The original Tribunal made a material error of law.
     The following decision is accordingly substituted:
           The appeal is dismissed on immigration grounds.
            The appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds.
