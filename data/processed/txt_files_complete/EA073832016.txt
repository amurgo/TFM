                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant in this case is a citizen of Morocco  who  applied  on  7
    December 2015 for a residence card as an extended family member  of  an
    EEA national under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1003
    as amended).  That application was refused by the Secretary of State on
    16 May 2016 and the appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appeal was dealt with on the papers by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Rodger on 7 July 2017.  In accordance with the decision  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal  [2016]  UKUT  411  (IAC),  the
    judge concluded that he had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal as there
    was no right of appeal under the 2006 Regulations by a person  claiming
    to be an extended family member of an EEA national who had been refused
    a residence card.

 3. Following that, the appellant sought permission to appeal to the  Upper
    Tribunal which was granted by the First-tier  Tribunal  on  16  January
    2018 in the light of the Court of Appeal's subsequent decision in  Khan
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 which
    had concluded that Sala was wrongly decided and that there was a  right
    of appeal under the 2006 Regulations  in  the  case  of  a  person  who
    claimed to be an extended family member of an EEA national and who  had
    been refused a residence card.

 4. The appeal was listed before us today.  The appellant  did  not  attend
    and his representatives on record also did not attend.  However in  the
    circumstances we considered it proper to deal with the appeal in  their
    absence without objection from Mr Jarvis who represented the  Secretary
    of State under rule 38 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended) on the basis that the appellant and  his
    representatives had notice of the hearing and it was in  the  interests
    of justice to proceed with it.

 5. In the light of the decision in Khan the appellant did  indeed  have  a
    right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal against the refusal to grant
    a residence card to him under the 2006 Regulations.

 6. In those circumstances we conclude that  the  judge  erred  in  law  in
    determining that he had no jurisdiction.

 7. We set aside his decision  and  remit  the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a substantive hearing before  a  judge  other  than  Judge
    Rodger.
