For the Appellant:     Mr A Moran, counsel instructed by Alex Moran

For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of Egypt, date of birth [  ]  1970,  appealed
    against the Respondent's decision, dated 27 April 2017,  to  refuse  an
    asylum claim.  His appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge O'Keefe
    (the Judge) who, on 26  June  2017,  dismissed  the  appeal  under  the
    Refugee Convention and Articles 2 and 3  ECHR.   On  8  September  2017
    Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul gave permission to appeal.  On 20 December
    2017 I promulgated my decision in which I found there was an  error  of
    law in that the Original  Tribunal  had  failed  to  give  adequate  or
    sufficient reasons.  Accordingly I directed that it be  remade  in  the
    Upper Tribunal, before me.  Further directions were given which led  to
    an additional bundle being produced by the Appellant which I gave leave
    for at the hearing on 5 March 2018.

2.   The additional bundle consists of a Facebook profile for the  Appellant
    from about three months ago as well as photo shots  of  a  play  taking
    place in London in which the Appellant appeared possibly as the accuser
    of the nominal leader who was variously described  as  an  insane  mass
    murderer.  The play was promoted under  the  name  "The  Trial  of  the
    Tyrant" by the Egyptian Revolutionary Council.  The essential character
    in the play is the President of Egypt, Mr Sisi.

3.   Some translations of the text that accompanied  the  photo  shots  show
    that they are of opposition to the President of Egypt.   The  role  the
    Appellant plays in the play is as a character  called  Majdy  Alabd  Al
    Ghaffar but  the  full  nature  of  his  appearance  and  role  is  not
    particularised but it is said by Mr Moran that it  is  consistent  with
    the Appellant's opposition to the current  authorities  and  consistent
    with his support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.

4.   The Appellant essentially puts his claim for protection  on  the  basis
    that he is a refugee sur place.   His  involvement  in  politics  comes
    partly through his Facebook posts which were made  between  the  period
    July 2013 and April 2017.  Secondly,  there  is  his  involvement  with
    writing satirical articles or news for  an  online  website  called  Al
    Gornal involving the period from February 2015 to January 2017.   These
    end dates reflect the nature of the claim that he made.  His  editorial
    activities are disputed but there is no issue that he was a contributor
    to Al Gornal and there is evidence that he was  in  communication  with
    the chief editor of that website, one Ms Ayat Orabi.  In addition there
    are photographs of the Appellant attending demonstrations in London.

5.   The Appellant  therefore  says  that  through  his  Facebook  posts  or
    through his activities with Al Gornal that he  will  be  known  to  the
    Egyptian security forces and intelligence services.  He knows that Ayat
    Orabi, who lives in the United States now,  has  been  the  subject  in
    absentia to a  trial  for  which  she  was  sentenced  to  five  years'
    imprisonment followed by, effectively, five years of house arrest.   If
    she returns to Egypt there is no issue that she would face hardship and
    indeed imprisonment with little prospect of  justice.   The  Appellant,
    who was historically the subject of an arrest warrant in 2014, which he
    said adds nothing to the matter now because it is his activities  since
    he has been in the United Kingdom.  Whilst he is of  less  significance
    than Ayat Orabi he claims the fact is he will through his Facebook  and
    involvement with websites be known to the authorities and  at  risk  of
    being seized on a return to Egypt.

6.   In support of his case he produced a number of country information  and
    background material which goes to show the extent to which  very  large
    numbers, of the order of 35,000 or more, who  have  been  arrested  and
    detained by the authorities in Egypt in the period through to 2017.  He
    therefore has no confidence that he would be treated in  any  different
    way to the many who have been held, detained and ill-treated, including
    some who have died in detention.  Also, there are articles produced  in
    relation to press freedom in Egypt.  It  is  quite  apparent  that  the
    authorities in Egypt are happy to categorise stories about Egypt  which
    they do not like as essentially being  'false  news',  or  'fake  news'
    stories giving rise to adverse attention upon either the website and/or
    the contributor who is named.  In this case there is no doubt that  for
    the articles on Al Gornal the Appellant has been identified in name and
    indeed there are photographs as well of him such that  he  says  "there
    really can be little doubt I would  be  identifiable  on  a  return  to
    Egypt".

7.   In addition, there are articles about the general repressive nature  of
    the Egyptian authorities and the risks they pose to  persons  perceived
    as being anti the authorities.  The Appellant and his wife have been in
    the United Kingdom now since 2004 or  thereabouts  and  they  have  two
    children.  The Appellant says that he believes his profile has  changed
    since the early days before he came to the United Kingdom and  that  he
    believes his wife, who is essentially  his  dependant,  faces,  through
    events in Egypt, risk on return.

8.   In something of a sub-plot which the Secretary of  State  relies  upon,
    the Appellant's wife, Amira  made,  before  her  visa  had  expired  in
    January 2015, an asylum claim.  On the submissions made she was  poorly
    advised in the manner in which she presented her case  that  FtT  Judge
    Mace  (the  Judge)  who  considered  her  appeal  was  unimpressed  and
    dismissed those appeals claiming protection.   The  Appellant  was  not
    involved in that appeal and  gave  no  evidence.   The  outcome  it  is
    submitted reflects on the poor  preparation  and  presentation  of  her
    claim.  Whether it would have succeeded is quite another matter  and  I
    express no view upon it.

9.   The Respondent, with reference to the case  of  Devaseelan,  sought  to
    rely upon the Judge's decision as demonstrating an unlikelihood of  the
    Appellant giving credible evidence  about  his  risk  on  return.   The
    Appellant gives an explanation as to why he was not involved,   in  his
    wife's claim, how his claim has changed over time and  the  consequence
    of the support he gives for the Muslim Brotherhood: Which  is  contrary
    to the  objectives  of  the  military  regime  in  Egypt.   Ultimately,
    therefore, the Appellant maintains his belief  that  the  President  of
    Egypt, Mr Sisi, is not only robbing  and  oppressing  a  generation  of
    Egyptian people but he is depriving them of democratic ways and outlets
    and reinforcing  the  vested  interest  of  the  state.   His  opinions
    written in his  satirical  fashion  may  be  understood  as  satire  by
    Egyptians although, on the face of it, is not   as  we  in  the  United
    Kingdom might recognise, satire.  I have no doubt to those in the  know
    and persons who understand politics in Egypt the  satirical  nature  of
    the articles is understood.  As to  the  Appellant's  articles  written
    with a factual basis to them and essentially journalism, they again are
    significantly critical of the current administration of Egypt.

10.  I have taken  into  account  the  adverse  views  that  the  Respondent
    reflected in the original Reasons for Refusal Letter but I do not agree
    that the Appellant's sur place claim is founded upon a false basis.   I
    do not have to resolve the issue of whether the  arrest  warrant  is  a
    reliable document but I do not find it has been produced to support and
    buttress a false claim being made.  Rather, if it is to be the  subject
    of criticism, it does not seem to me  that  falls  immediately  at  the
    Appellant's door given the subsequent sur place  activities  which  are
    really unchallenged.  Whether or not the Appellant's motive is  in  the
    sense contemplated by the case of Danian is very difficult to  say  but
    ultimately Danian [1999] EWCA Civ  3000  demonstrates  that  the  broad
    considerations that need to be embarked upon in assessing a claim  true
    or false, concocted or otherwise, YB  (Eritrea)  [2008]  EWCA  Civ  360
    makes the point  about  sur  place  activities  and  how  they  may  be
    construed and understood to indicate,  whether or not the claim is true
    .

11.    I have to assess whether or not the  Appellant's  activities  in  the
    United Kingdom expose him to the risk of persecution or serious harm if
    returned.  I have to consider whether or not the  possibilities  of  an
    adverse interest being taken in him present a real risk.  In the  light
    of YB and the helpful discussion therein concerning such risk, I  reach
    the conclusion that the Appellant's UK-based activities do give rise to
    a risk on return.  I apply of course the low standard of  proof  to  be
    found in the case of Sivakumaran [1998]  Imm  AR  147  and  Karanakaran
    [2000] EWCA Civ 11 in terms of assessing the real  risk.   I  therefore
    find, in the light of the case law, the  background  material  and  the
    Appellant's claim, bearing in mind the low standard of proof  that  the
    Appellant has done sufficient to show that his conduct  gives  rise  to
    the likelihood of real adverse interest being taken in him  because  of
    his political opinions or use of the Facebook website and Al Gornal  on
    line.

12.  Mr Moran took me to other websites where people who have been  involved
    with them are the subject of adverse attention by the  security  forces
    in Egypt.  I find those lists of names  consistent  with  the  kind  of
    treatment that the authorities perceive  anyone  critical  of  them  as
    being willing to take.  I find also that the fact that  Ms  Ayat  Orabi
    has a high profile is not the end of the  matter.  The  fact  that  the
    authorities regard it worth the publicity pursuing  her  to  discourage
    others in absentia does not mean that there is  some  good  reason  why
    they should not pursue a lesser contributor to Al Gornal  such  as  the
    Appellant.  I therefore have treated the decision of Judge Mace in  the
    context of the evidence, such as it was before  him,  not  knowing  the
    degree to which it really touched and affected the Appellant's  conduct
    in the UK.  I take into account that the new matters  have  moved  this
    along and so it is not simply a comparison of like for like as  between
    his wife and him in this appeal. I found the Appellant claim  credible,
    consistent with the background evidence and the documents he  produced.
    I find his sur place activities are likely to  have  been  seen  and/or
    heard of by the Egyptian security services.

13.  Accordingly, I concluded that there is a real risk  of  persecution  on
    account of the Appellant's political opinions from the  Egyptian  State
    and that there is no sufficient protection from the state to  which  he
    can have recourse and that internal relocation  does  not  represent  a
    reasonable option to avoid the adverse  interests  of  the  State.   In
    concluding those matters I have taken into account the Facebook  pages,
    the evidence of support of Muslim Brotherhood, the authorities wish  to
    crush  adverse  criticism,  the  consequences  of  writing  anti-regime
    articles and posting those on Al Gornal.  I do not think the  Appellant
    was ever formally an  editor  of  Al  Gornal  but  I  think  he,  as  a
    contributor, had the opportunity to express his views which he  did  to
    Ms Orabi.  In the climate which does not seem  to  be  in  abeyance  of
    political life in Egypt, it is clear that opponents of the Sisi  regime
    are regularly arrested, detained, tortured and sentenced to long prison
    terms for political crimes.  Therefore I find the Appellant  faces  the
    real  risk  of  danger  of  persecution  and  proscribed  ill-treatment
    contrary to Article 3 ECHR by the State, on return to Egypt.

NOTICE OF DECISION

The appeal is allowed under the Refugee Convention and/or Article 3 ECHR

An anonymity order is appropriate in the circumstances of this case.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

A fee of �140 was paid by the Appellant and the appeal has succeeded on  the

appropriate.
