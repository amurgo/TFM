Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Shilliday, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms A Benfield instructed by A P Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Entry Clearance Officer has been granted  permission  to  challenge
    the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Ghani who allowed  an  appeal
    under Article 8 by the respondent, a national of Sri Lanka who was born
    in May 2013.  I shall refer to the respondent as the claimant and as he
    is a minor I make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  prohibiting  the  disclosure  or
    publication of any matter likely to  lead  members  of  the  public  to
    identify him.

 2. His  father  a  British  citizen  lives  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The
    claimant's mother is a national of Sri Lanka and  she  lives  with  the
    claimant in Colombo.  The couple married in August 2012  in  Sri  Lanka
    after which she was granted entry  clearance  twelve  months  later  to
    enter the UK.  At the time she applied  for  entry  clearance  she  was
    pregnant with the claimant who as I have observed above was born in May
    2013.

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer refused the claimant's  application  on  27
    February 2014 followed by a further decision dated 17 July  2014.   The
    reason for the  first  decision  was  a  failure  to  meet  the  income
    threshold under the relevant provision of Appendix  FM.   Although  the
    claimant's mother had been  issued  with  entry  clearance,  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer contended she was still  subject  to  UK  immigration
    control and it was incumbent upon the sponsor to show  a  gross  annual
    income of �22,400.  The sponsor's income did not  meet  this  threshold
    based on the documents that had been submitted.

 4. In addition, the Entry Clearance Officer was  not  satisfied  that  the
    claimant would be adequately accommodated without  recourse  to  public
    funds in the  absence  of  evidence  regarding  the  size  and  current
    occupancy of the proposed accommodation and the absence of consent from
    the landlord  or  owner.   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  nevertheless
    indicated that no final determination has been made whether the  income
    threshold and/or related evidential requirements had been  met  as  the
    courts had not decided the outcome of the Secretary of  State's  appeal
    in the legal challenge to the income threshold requirement.  That final
    determination was made in the second decision.  Although  not  referred
    to this is likely to have been in the light of the  decision  in  MM  &
    Others, R (on the application of) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985 which  was
    handed down on 11 July.

 5. The second decision by the Entry Clearance Officer restates  the  gross
    income  requirement  of  �22,400.   The  sponsor's  income   from   his
    employments amounted to �20,017.63 per annum.  It was observed that the
    shortfall could only be met  by  savings  of  �21,955.63  of  which  no
    evidence had been provided.  Concern was also expressed that  the  cash
    deposits to the sponsor's bank account were  not  consistent  with  the
    total net income claimed on the payslips submitted from Ozland Limited,
    a second employment by the  sponsor  in  addition  to  KFC.   Thus  the
    application was refused with reference to the  relevant  provisions  of
    Appendix FM.  No issue regarding accommodation was raised.

 6. The appeal by the claimant was against the first  decision  on  grounds
    that the relevant minimum income threshold had been met.  A report from
    Environmental Health Management Service Consultants was referred to  in
    respect of the  accommodation.   It  is  also  argued  that  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer had failed to consider the child's best interests and
    furthermore it is argued that the decision was contrary to Article 8.

 7. The judge noted that it was accepted on behalf of the claimant that  he
    was unable to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules and wished
    solely to rely on Article 8.

 8. After directing himself as to the authorities the  judge  reached  this
    conclusion at [10] of his decision:

         "The refusal of the application must not  result  in  unjustifiably
         harsh consequences such as to be disproportionate under Article  8.
         The appellant has to establish some compelling circumstances  which
         would  justify  departure  from   the   immigration   rules.    The
         appellant's mother has been granted entry  clearance  to  join  the
         appellant's father thereby accepting and acknowledging  that  there
         is a genuine and subsisting spousal relationship.  The family  unit
         as a whole must be kept together and they must enjoy family life as
         a unit.  The respondent's decision is preventing the appellant from
         sending his formative months with both his parents.  This cannot be
         said to be in his best interest.  As a  young  child  his  interest
         lies by living with both his mother and father  I  find  that  this
         constitutes an exceptional  circumstances  and  merits  substantial
         Article 8 analysis.  Applying the  principles  of  RAZGAR  and  the
         HUANG test, and taking into account  the  rights  of  both  parents
         (BEOKU-BETTS) to refuse the appellant entry clearance to live  with
         both  his  parents   is   an   interference   which   I   find   is
         disproportionate as the legitimate aim appears to be  the  economic
         well-being  of  the  country  through  immigration  control.    The
         appellant's father is earning sufficient  amount  to  maintain  the
         family without recourse to public funds.  The decision  is  clearly
         preventing the development of family life by  enforcing  separation
         of the family.  I must of course take into account  the  amendments
         made in section 117 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
         2002 as a result of implementation of section 19 of the Immigration
         Act 2014.  I accept that one of the  matters  listed  in  paragraph
         117B of the Immigration Act 2014 is immigration control which is in
         the  public  interest.   However,  the  sponsor   is   economically
         independent and it cannot be in the best interest of  appellant  to
         remain separated from the sponsoring father.  These factors I  find
         outweigh  the  legitimate  aim  of  immigration  control   in   the
         appellant's case."

 9. The challenge is lengthy from which I distil the following points:

      i) The claimant and  his  mother  could  continue  their  family  life
         together with the sponsor in Sri Lanka should they wish to do so.

     ii) There was available the alternative remedy  to  re-apply  with  the
         correct evidence in support of the application.

    iii) There was no reasoning why it would be unjustifiably harsh for  the
         claimant to remain in Sri Lanka  with  his  mother  and  the  judge
         failed to consider that family life could be continued there.

     iv) The judge had failed to consider or give adequate reasons  why  the
         sponsor could not  return  to  Sri  Lanka  taking  account  of  his
         previous visits.

      v) Article 8 cannot be used to  circumvent  the  requirements  of  the
         Immigration Rules.

     vi) The judge failed to refer to the correct  test  when  conducting  a
         balancing exercise.  There were  no  compelling  circumstances  why
         family life could not continue in Sri Lanka.  Article  8  does  not
         oblige the United Kingdom to accept the choice of individuals as to
         which country they would prefer to reside in.

    vii) Should the sponsor not wish to reside in Sri Lanka the relationship
         could  be  maintained  through  visits   and   "modern   means   of
         communication in the interim.

   viii) The Tribunal's finding amounted to one that the  Immigration  Rules
         will never be proportionate in a case involving a British citizen.

10. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly  on
    the basis that it was arguable that the Tribunal had simply allowed the
    appeal on the basis of a near miss under the financial  provisions  and
    that it had misdirected itself by failing to consider whether it  would
    be reasonable to expect family life  to  continue  in  the  country  of
    origin.

11. Ms Benfield clarified at the outset of the hearing that the sponsor  is
    a British citizen by naturalisation on 29 July 2013.  There was no Rule
    24 response.

12. Mr Shilliday summarised the Secretary of State's challenge to  be  that
    the judge had allowed the appeal without their proper approach  as  set
    out in Nagre v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) and Gulshan  (Article  8  -
    new rules correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC).   He  argued  that
    the judge had failed to explore why the sponsor could not return to Sri
    Lanka.  The specific purpose of the Rules was to avoid migrants  coming
    here to rely on public funds.  He did not however assert irrationality.
    All the factors raised by the judge in paragraph  10  were  dealt  with
    under the Rules.

13. Ms Benfield accepted that the income threshold of �22,400 could not  be
    met.  In her view the judge had not  erred.   He  had  focused  on  the
    child's best interests and had regard to  the  relevant  factors.   She
    contended the right test had been applied.

14. By way of response Mr  Shilliday  accepted  that  the  spirit  of  s.55
    applied to this case but argued in addition  that  the  judge  had  not
    specified the public interest.  The Entry  Clearance  Officer  had  not
    decided the relationship should continue in  the  United  Kingdom;  all
    that  had  happened  was  that  the  claimant's  mother  had  met   the
    requirements of the Rules.

Analysis

15. Short of any rationality challenge which Mr Shilliday did not  seek  to
    advance, the grounds involve argument as to the judge's direction as to
    the law, the adequacy of reasons and whether all relevant factors  were
    taken into account.  The first question is whether  the  judge  applied
    the correct test. At paragraph [9] he referred to a number of  relevant
    authorities as to the approach he was  required  to  take.  The  second
    sentence of [10] (see [8] above) indicates the judge had  in  mind  the
    need to see if there were  some  compelling  circumstances  that  would
    justify departure from the Immigration Rules.  The judge  was  required
    to see whether  there  were  compelling  circumstances  that  were  not
    sufficiently recognised by the Rules as was clearly stated by  Sales  J
    in Nagre at [29] of his judgment:

         "Nonetheless, the new rules do provide better explicit coverage  of
         the factors identified in case  law  as  relevant  to  analysis  of
         claims under Article 8 than was formerly the position, so  in  many
         cases the main points for consideration in relation  to  Article  8
         will be addressed by decision-makers applying the new rules. It  is
         only if, after doing that, there  remains  an  arguable  case  that
         there may be good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  the
         Rules by reference to Article 8  that  it  will  be  necessary  for
         Article  8  purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are
         compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the  new
         rules to require the grant of such leave."

16. The issue whether there is an intermediate test was  addressed  by  the
    Court of Appeal in Singh v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 784 in  which  at  [64]
    Underhill LJ explained why he did not read  Sales  J  as  intending  to
    impose  an  intermediate  requirement  but  with   reference   to   the
    observation of Aikens LJ in MM (Lebanon):

         "...what matters is that there is nothing in  Aikens  LJ's  comment
         which cast doubt on Sales J's basic point that there was no need to
         conduct a full separate examination of Article 8 outside the  Rules
         where, in the circumstances of a particular  case  all  the  issues
         have been addressed in the consideration under the Rules."

17. Whilst the judge correctly referred to compelling circumstances, he did
    add to his direction the need to assess whether these were sufficiently
    recognised or not under the Rules.  The factors  he  considered  to  be
    compelling were these:

      i) The claimant's mother had been granted entry clearance.

     ii) The family unit as a whole must be kept together.

    iii) The Entry Clearance Officer's decision prevented the claimant  from
         spending his formative months with both parents which  was  not  in
         his best interests.  Those interests lay with living with  both  of
         his parents.

18. The judge found these constituted  exceptional  circumstances  meriting
    substantial Article 8 analysis.  However there is no reference  in  his
    analysis of the extent to which these factors were already catered  for
    under the Rules.  The  fact  of  the  claimant's  mother  having  entry
    clearance which she had not exercised cannot be  material  as  her  not
    having done so was precisely because the claimant  had  been  born  and
    thus required entry clearance himself. Family unity  was  a  matter  in
    prospect; they had not  previously  lived  together.   Unity  could  be
    achieved under the Rules provided  the  maintenance  requirements  were
    met. These  requirements  have  been  found  in  MM  to  be  article  8
    compliant. The claimant's  best  interests  were  correctly  identified
    however there was no real consideration given to  whether  this  aspect
    could be served by his father returning to Sri Lanka.

19. In my view the judge erred by failing to give adequate reasons for  his
    finding that there were  compelling  circumstances  in  this  case  and
    further more failed to factor into the proportionality exercise  a  key
    factor being the possibility of the claimant's father joining  him  and
    his mother in Sri Lanka. This is not a case where it can be  said  that
    the  judge  applied  the  correct  test  and  reached  a  generous  but
    permissible  conclusion.   This  error  is   one   of   substance   and
    sufficiently material to require the decision to be set aside.

20. Ms Benfield and Mr  Shilliday  were  content  for  me  to  re-make  the
    decision based on the material that was before the judge in  the  event
    that error was found.

21. This is an unfortunate case.  There is no doubt that  family  life  has
    been established following the marriage and expressed through the birth
    of the claimant.  The evidence before the Entry Clearance  Officer  and
    the First-tier Tribunal does not indicate that  the  claimant  and  his
    parents have lived together in Colombo.  At the time of decision he had
    been employed with KFC through Ozland Limited on a permanent and  full-
    time basis since November 2009.  It would appear the time that  he  had
    spent in Colombo has been short.   Accordingly,  the  decision  of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer is not one that is breaking up the  family  but
    one that is not facilitating its unification.

22. I am satisfied that the best interests of the claimant are to  be  with
    his parents.  Section 55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration
    Act 2009 does not apply to children who are outside the United  Kingdom
    as explained in T (s.55 BCIA 2009 -  entry  clearance)  Jamaica  [2011]
    UKUT 00483 (IAC.  As observed by the Tribunal:

         "When the interests of the child  are  under  consideration  in  an
         entry clearance case, it may be necessary  to  make  investigations
         and where appropriate having regard to age, the child  herself  may
         need to be interviewed."

23.  The  child's  best  interests  have  a  bearing  on  the   Article   8
    consideration.  There was no evidence at the time of decision that  the
    claimant was at any risk or that his mother was unable to  manage  with
    the claimant's day-to-day care.

24. The claimant's father is a British citizen.  As observed by  Aikens  LJ
    in MM & Others v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985 when reviewing the lawfulness
    of the minimum income requirements under the Rules at [138]:

         "...There is nothing in the 1971 Act or the common law that  grants
         a 'constitutional right' of British citizens to live in the UK with
         non-EEA partners who do not have the right of abode in the  UK  and
         who are currently living outside the UK. Of course, I  accept  that
         the UK partner (whether a UK citizen of a refugee  or  person  with
         HP) is entitled to respect of his or her  right  to  marry  and  to
         found a family. But those are not  absolute  rights;  there  is  no
         absolute right to marry and found a family in the UK if it involves
         marriage to a non-EEA citizen who then  wishes  to  reside  in  the
         UK....".

25. Accordingly the fact that the claimant's father is a British citizen is
    not a compelling factor.

26. Aikens LJ also considered the relationship between s.55 and the minimum
    income requirements.  As he observed at [163]:

         "First, paragraph GEN.1.1 of Appendix FM states that the  provision
         of the family route 'takes into account the need to  safeguard  and
         promote the welfare of children in the UK',  which  indicates  that
         the Secretary of State  has  had  regard  to  the  statutory  duty.
         Secondly, there is no legal requirement that the Immigration  Rules
         should provide that the best  interests  of  the  child  should  be
         determinative. Section 55 is  not  a  'trump  card'  to  be  played
         whenever the interests of a child arise. Thus, thirdly, the new MIR
         are only a part of requirements set out  in  Appendix  FM,  but  an
         important part. If a child in the UK is to be joined by  a  non-EEA
         partner under the 'partner rules' (as compared with those under  E-
         LTRPT.2.3) then it is reasonable to require, for the  child's  best
         interests, that there be adequate financial provision for the  unit
         of which the child will be a part if the non-EEA partner joins  it.
         If the financial requirements are otherwise judged  to  be  lawful,
         then, on the financial front, that must mean the  section  55  duty
         has been discharged in framing the relevant IR...".

27. Whilst the  best  interests  of  the  claimant  clearly  point  to  the
    desirability of family unification, the  financial  requirements  under
    the Rules have been found to be justified.  The fact as observed by the
    judge that the claimant's father is earning sufficient to maintain  the
    family without recourse to public funds is not  the  correct  approach.
    The Rules set out a financial criteria that is Article 8 compliant.

28. The only reason why the claimant was unsuccessful under the  Rules  was
    because of  the  financial  requirements.   I  have  sympathy  for  the
    claimant and his mother.  Their desire to be with the  sponsor  in  the
    United Kingdom is a natural and entirely understandable  one.   But  in
    all the circumstances of  this  case  their  ambitions  are  adequately
    catered for within the Rules and I am unable  to  find  any  compelling
    circumstances that justifies allowing this appeal on Article 8 grounds.



NOTICE OF DECISION

29. By way of conclusion therefore the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    is set aside for error of law.  I re-make the decision and dismiss  the
    appeal on human rights grounds and under the Immigration Rules.
