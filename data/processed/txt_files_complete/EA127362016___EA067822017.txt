                     DECISION BY CONSENT AND DIRECTIONS


Determination by Consent

 1. Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and by the consent of the parties the following order is made:

    Upon the  parties'  agreement  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal promulgated on 7th November 2017 discloses a material error of
    law, it is hereby ordered by consent as follows:

      1) the First-tier Tribunal Judge made errors of law in relation to the
         assessment of the issue of a marriage of convenience.  The  essence
         of the error being that the judge  solely  considered  the  Islamic
         marriage which took place in November 2015 between the EEA  Sponsor
         and a third country national  rather  than  considering  the  civil
         marriage ceremony which  took  place  in  2017  -  that  being  the
         formalisation of the relationship between the European national and
         third country national - which would be the relevant marriage  when
         gauging whether a marriage of convenience exists  against  the  EEA
         Regulations and the European Directive on Free Movement;

      2) in addition to the identified Grounds of Appeal, I further note the
         judge did not make reference to the most  relevant  authority  from
         the Upper Tribunal, which would have been of assistance to her/him,
         that  being  Papajorgji  [2012]  UKUT  38  which  appends  the   EU
         Commission Guidance on marriages of  convenince  to  that  reported
         decision,

      3) the matter is to be remitted to be heard by a Judge of  the  First-
         tier Tribunal other than Judge Buchanan.

 2. The Appellants' appeal to the Upper Tribunal is therefore allowed.

 3. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for legal error by
    consent.


Signed                                  Date 18th March 2018


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Saini
