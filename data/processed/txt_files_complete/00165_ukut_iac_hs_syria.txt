   1.    Where the Secretary of State revokes a residence  card  before  the
      expiry of its validity it falls on her to justify such revocation.
   2.   Regulation 10 of Immigration (EEA)  Regulations  2006  requires  the
      applicant to demonstrate that: a genuine  marriage  has  lasted  three
      years and the couple have  spent  one  year  together  in  the  United
      Kingdom and that the EEA national spouse was exercising treaty  rights
      at the time he ceased to be a family member.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1.       This is an  appeal  against  a  decision  of  the  First  Tier
       Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber (IJ Freestone) given  on  30
       July 2010 dismissing the  present  appellant's  appeal  against  the
       decision of the Secretary of State who  had  revoked  his  residence
       card issued as a family member of a   qualified  person  within  the
       meaning of the  Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.


    2.       The material facts are as follows. The appellant is  a  Syrian
       national. On 6 September 2001 he married a Spanish  national  Isabel
       Gutierrez in Cheshire, England.  Thereafter  the  appellant  applied
       for a residence card to remain with his wife  who  was  said  to  be
       exercising Treaty rights. On the 7 December  2002  this  application
       was granted by an endorsement in the passport valid for a period  of
       5 years to 5 December 2007.

    3.       The appellant made a subsequent application  for  a  residence
       card that was received by the Home Office on  6  February  2007.  By
       this time his marriage was in difficulty. A decree nisi  of  divorce
       was issued on 16 October 2006 and the decree was made absolute on 19
       March 2007. In law he remained married to the EEA  national  at  the
       time the application form was completed. The nature of  this  second
       application was not before the IJ  and  was  not  in  the  materials
       before us to prepare for this hearing.

    4.       Mr Tarlow was able to produce the application form to  us  and
       it is apparent that it was an application for  a  further  residence
       card on the grounds of marriage. Section 4 of the  form  dealt  with
       the wife's economic activity and she  is  described  as  a  waitress
       working 10 hours a week for Mediterranean of Chester  Limited  at  a
       salary of �50.00 per week. The form  indicates  that  at  least  one
       recent wage slip was provided although this does not appear to  have
       been retained on file. Although such matters are meant to be decided
       promptly and within 6 months, it was not until 29 November 2007 that
       a further residence card was issued with a  validity  of  a  further
       five years. By this time the appellant was divorced.

    5.       The appellant believed he was entitled to permanent  residence
       and communicated with the Home Office to this effect. He was invited
       to re-apply for  such  status  which  he  did  on  13  January  2009
       disclosing the divorce document and his present circumstances.

    6.       On  5 August 2009 the  Home  Office  wrote  to  the  appellant
       asking for the following  information:-

          a. "Evidence that you and your ex-wife... cohabited in the  United
             Kingdom for one year during your marriage".
          b. "Evidence that your wife was exercising her  Treaty  rights  in
             the United Kingdom from 2004 up until the date of divorce on 19
             March 2007 ie wage slips, employment letters, P60s etc".
          c. "Evidence that you have exercised Treaty rights in  the  United
             Kingdom since the date of your divorce  up  until  the  present
             date".

    7.       Some information was provided but it was not enough to satisfy
       the Secretary of State.  Permanent residence was not granted, rather
       on 3 September 2009 the decision was made  to  revoke  the  existing
       residence card because:


             "On 29th November 2007 you were issued  a  residence  card  as
             confirmation of a right of residence in the United Kingdom  as
             a family member of  a  qualified  person.  However,  you  have
             ceased to be the family member of that person  and  no  longer
             have a right of residence in the United Kingdom or  the  right
             to hold a residence card confirming that right".

    8.       Accompanying this decision was a reasons  for  refusal  letter
       that stated:


             "You have failed to provide the documents that were  requested
             by this department on 5 August  2009,  therefore  you  do  not
             qualify  for  permanent  residence  under  retained  right  of
             residence".


    9.       The IJ heard from the appellant and  received  some  documents
       from him relating to the  employment  of  his  former  wife  in  his
       restaurant  business,  and  some  evidence  about  the   appellant's
       employment since his divorce. There was a bank statement in a  joint
       account from December 2001.  There were wage slips for the wife  for
       February and March 2006; a P60 tax slip showing the wife had  earned
       �358 to the year ending 5 April 2006 and no  earnings  the  previous
       year and a P60 end of year certificate for the tax year to  5  April
       2007. This showed the wife to have earned �3900, or  an  average  of
       approximately �75 per week over a 52 week period.


   10. At paragraph 3 of her decision, the IJ stated  that  the  burden  of
       proof was on the appellant and the standard of proof was the balance
       of probabilities.  She had concerns about a letter from  a  landlord
       stating when the couple had cohabited and some of  the  evidence  of
       the appellant's present earnings. She noted that the  appellant  was
       the owner of Mediterranean of Chester Limited and  that  wage  slips
       for the entirety of the marriage had  not  been  provided.  She  had
       concerns about the reliability of some of the documents produced  to
       show the appellant's employment since the divorce because wage slips
       for Moods Music Bar showed his monthly pay for  August  and  October
       2007 as �978.69. There was a letter from an employer (Beauty Lounge)
       indicating that the appellant was employed as a  manager  from  2008
       and continuing.  She concluded that  the  appellant  had  failed  to
       provide credible evidence of the three matters that the Home  Office
       had put in issue. She accordingly dismissed the appeal.

   11. Permission to appeal was granted by SIJ Storey on 17 September  2010
       who observed that it was an arguable error for the IJ to have placed
       the burden of proof on the appellant in a revocation case.

      The submissions of the parties
   12. The central submission of Mr Davidson for  the  appellant  reflected
       the grounds on which permission had been granted by the SIJ. He  had
       the disadvantage that his instructing solicitors  had  not  provided
       him with a bundle of the materials provided to judge below; no fresh
       bundle had been prepared to support the contentions in  the  grounds
       of appeal and the appellant himself did not appear and  so  was  not
       available to provide instruction. This was poor preparation  by  the
       solicitors in  this  case.   The  Tribunal  and  the  advocates  are
       entitled to expect that an appeal bundle  of  relevant  material  is
       prepared, indexed, paginated and supplied in good  time  before  the
       appeal with some explanation in the grounds of appeal or a  skeleton
       argument what the appellant's case is  and  why  the  materials  are
       relevant to demonstrate it.


   13. Further, when the second  application  form  was  disclosed  it  was
       apparent that the appellant's team were acting on a misapprehension.
       The second residence permit was not issued as an acknowledgement  of
       a retained right of residence as a former spouse of EEA national but
       granted a  further  permit  as  a  spouse.   The  Home  Office  were
       accordingly correct to identify that there  had  been  a  change  of
       circumstances  since  its  issue  namely  the  termination  of   the
       marriage. If there had been a material change of circumstances  then
       (subject to the issue of whether he had already  acquired  permanent
       residence by the time on his divorce: see below  paragraphs  48  and
       following) the question to be decided in this appeal is whether  the
       appellant had a retained right of residence following his divorce.

   14. In the event Mr Tarlow told us that his instructions  were  that  it
       was accepted that in a revocation case the burden was  on  the  Home
       Office to  justify  the  revocation.  We  were  not  sure  that  the
       implications of this acceptance had been thought  through  in  every
       aspect.

   15. Further, the present case was both an appeal against  revocation  of
       an existing residence card and a  first  application  for  permanent
       residence.

The power to revoke a residence card
   16.  Regulation  20  of  the  EEA  Regulations  2006  (the  Regulations)
       provides:


          "(1)  The Secretary of State may refuse to issue, revoke or refuse
          to renew a registration certificate, a residence card, a  document
          certifying permanent residence or a permanent  residence  card  if
          the refusal or  revocation  is  justified  on  grounds  of  public
          policy, public security or public health.


          (2)  The Secretary of State may revoke a registration  certificate
          or a residence card or refuse to renew a  residence  card  if  the
          holder of the certificate or card has ceased to have  a  right  to
          reside under these Regulations.


          (3) The Secretary  of  State  may  revoke  a  document  certifying
          permanent residence or a permanent residence card if the holder of
          the certificate or card has ceased to have a  right  of  permanent
          residence under these Regulations."

   17. In the case of DA (EEA, revocation of  residence  document)  Algeria
       [2006] UKAIT 00027, the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  concluded
       that a power of revocation on grounds of  absence  of  qualification
       for a right of residence  was  not  inconsistent  with  the  EP  and
       Council Directive 2004/38/EC (the Directive) although  no  provision
       for revocation on such grounds was set out  in  the  Directive.   In
       that case there was no dispute that the appellant  ceased  to  be  a
       family member of a qualified person as it was common ground that the
       EEA spouse had left the United Kingdom on an indefinite  basis.  The
       Tribunal did not have to consider and did not address the  issue  of
       the burden of proof in a disputed case.

   18. It is trite that in EU law cases,  the  residence  document  is  the
       evidence of the right and not the source of it.  It is reflected  in
       the language of Article 10 (1) of the Directive:

         "The right of residence of family members of a  Union  citizen  who
         are not nationals of a Member  State  shall  be  evidenced  by  the
         issuing of a document called 'Residence card of a family member  of
         a Union citizen' no later than six months from the  date  on  which
         they submit the application".

   19. It follows logically that in a case where there is a dispute  as  to
       whether a person has the right of residence, the real issue will  be
       whether they in fact qualify for the right and not whether  they  do
       or do not hold a residence permit evidencing the right. We note that
       Rogers and Scannell  "Free  Movement  of  Persons  in  the  Enlarged
       European Union" (2005) state at 11-33:


         "The corollary  to  the  proposition  that  residence  permits  are
         declaratory of the underlying rights to which they relate  is  that
         possession of a residence  permit  cannot  be  taken  to  be  proof
         positive of the existence of a right to remain"

   20. The Court of Appeal in the case of Secretary of State for  Work  and
       Pensions v Maria Dias [2009] EWCA Civ 31 July 2009 reached much  the
       same conclusion when considering the evidential value of a residence
       permit issued under previous legislation. It noted at [33]:


           "It was accepted before us that European  law,  at  the  material
          time in Directive 68/360, gives the EU worker a right to reside in
          another member State whether or not the required residence  permit
          has been issued: Royer, Case 48/75, [1976] ECR 497, see especially
          paragraphs 31-33. But Mr Berry, for Ms Dias,  contends  that  once
          the permit is granted the right exists through the permit. He says
          that Article 4(2) of Directive 68/360 (quoted above  at  paragraph
          26(iv)), in speaking of the  permit  as  proof  of  the  right  to
          reside, in effect means that the permit  is  conclusive  proof  of
          that right, at least unless and until it is revoked. The  contrary
          contention of the Secretary of State is that the permit  is  proof
          only of the right which underlies it, and that that right  is  one
          which avails only a worker and not someone who no longer is."


        The submissions of the Secretary of State  were  preferred  and  at
        [38] the following observations were made:
          "It is no doubt true that a permit can be revoked or withdrawn  if
          the holder  no  longer  meets  the  conditions  of  article  7  of
          Directive 2004/38, and that this one had not been.  There  was  in
          fact no reason to consider revocation  in  2003  because  at  that
          stage nothing of significance turned in the UK on the EU citizen's
          right to reside; it was only in 2004 that  entitlement  to  income
          support began to turn on it. But in any event, to  hold  that  the
          permit remained conclusive evidence of a right  to  reside  unless
          revoked would impose a disproportionate burden of enquiry upon any
          host State, which would have to make constant intrusions into  the
          life of the holder to see whether the conditions of article 7 were
          still being satisfied. Such enquiries of EU citizens, which  would
          not  be  made  of  UK  nationals,   might   well   be   considered
          discriminatory."
         A reference to the Court of Justice was made and we have  seen  the
         opinion of the Advocate General dated 17 February 2011 that  agrees
         with this analysis. However the Court of Appeal had also  noted  at
         [36]:-
          "To hold that article 16 requires five years' residence complying
          with the Directive, thus excluding residence when Ms Dias was not
          a worker within article 7, despite the existence of  the  permit,
          would not deprive the permit of any significance. It needs to  be
          remembered that the provisions which successive  Directives  have
          made for the issue of residence permits have been designed to  be
          suitable to the varying rules and  regulations  applying  in  the
          disparate Member  States.  Some  Member  States  require  persons
          within  their   borders   to   carry   identification   documents
          demonstrating their status. That the UK does not do so  does  not
          mean that the permit will not be an important document elsewhere.
          Nor is it without significance in the UK.  Although  it  is  true
          that the UK does not now require  EU  citizens  to  pass  through
          immigration controls beyond a passport check, that was not always
          so; the notes on the permit issued seem  to  be  a  remnant  from
          earlier times. But even without immigration control  or  identity
          card use, the document clearly has utility as enabling the holder
          to demonstrate to any official or  unofficial  enquirer  in  what
          capacity he or she is present in the UK. In particular it enables
          the holder to demonstrate, for example to an employer, the  right
          to be  employed,  which  many  other  persons  present,  such  as
          visitors and asylum seekers, do not have. A permit which says, in
          effect: "The holder has the right to be here to work"  is  by  no
          means useless. And if official enquiry should, for  some  reason,
          be made into the legality of the presence of the  holder  in  the
          UK, it is not useless to be able to demonstrate from  the  permit
          that there is the right to be here if working, and  by  reference
          to the employer that the condition of employment is met."
   21. A residence permit performs two functions. It is evidence  that  the
       Secretary of State was satisfied at the time it was issued that  the
       holder had rights of residence  under  EU  law,  and  its  continued
       validity serves to enable third  parties  to  be  satisfied  of  the
       holder's status during the currency of the card. A non  EU  national
       family member may in particular need to prove who he is and that  he
       has authority to work and reside in the United Kingdom for the  time
       being.


   22. Residence documentation cannot be arbitrarily cancelled  or  revoked
       and for reasons noted by the Court  of  Appeal  proof  of  continued
       existence of a right of residence cannot  be  demanded  at  frequent
       intervals during its currency.  The Citizens  Directive  Article  11
       contemplates that a residence card is valid for five years  and  the
       only specific contingency for loss of validity identified is absence
       for a substantial period of time. Article 14 (2)  of  the  Directive
       provides that:

         "Union citizens and their family members shall have  the  right  of
         residence provided for in Articles 7, 12, and 13 as  long  as  they
         meet the conditions therein. In specific cases  where  there  is  a
         reasonable doubt as to whether a Union citizen  or  his/her  family
         members satisfies the conditions set out in Articles 7, 12 and  13,
         Member States may verify if these conditions  are  fulfilled.  This
         verification shall not be carried out systematically".

   23. In the cases of both DA and Dias  the  facts  were  agreed  and  the
       absence of a right of residence was clear. What is the  position  if
       the facts are not clear and the Secretary of State seeks to revoke a
       residence card party-way through its period of validity?


   24. Where a right of residence is being revoked under  regulation  20(1)
       on public policy grounds, the circumstances are likely be similar to
       deportation on conducive grounds or general grounds  of  refusal  of
       entry where it is clear that the burden lies  on  the  Secretary  of
       State to establish  on  the  civil  standard  the  facts  justifying
       revocation see JC (Part 9 HC 395-burden of proof) China [2007] UKAIT
       0007.

   25. But a residence card can clearly be revoked on broader grounds  than
       conduct making cancellation of the card and removal from the  United
       Kingdom  appropriate.  If  a  card   is   obtained   by   fraud   or
       misrepresentation then it would be open to the issuing authority  to
       cancel it but again the onus would be on the Secretary of State. But
       if  it  could  be  shown  that  a  card  was  issued  in  error   by
       administrative mistake, we see no reason why it  should  be  revoked
       even if the holder has no right of residence.

   26. Loss of the right of residence during the currency of the card would
       be another circumstance entitling the Secretary of State  to  revoke
       the card, even though there appears to be no procedure for inquiring
       afresh into the existence of a residence right  in  the  absence  of
       reasonable grounds to suspect that no  such  right  exists.  We  are
       conscious that the Home Office will be  able  in  certain  cases  to
       access the tax and social records of individuals to check to see  if
       any economic activity is  continuing.   In  those  circumstances  as
       well, we would expect the basis of the reasonable  suspicion  to  be
       demonstrated by the Home Office and  so  there  is  some  evidential
       burden to raise a sufficient doubt to justify further inquiry.

   27. In immigration decisions made outside the context  of  EU  law,  the
       onus of justifying  revocation  or  curtailment  of  limited  leave,
       indefinite leave or a particular status would fall on the  authority
       taking the action in question. The ordinary meaning of the  word  in
       this context is "to annul, repeal,  rescind  to  cancel".  It  is  a
       different decision from a refusal to grant in the first place. As  a
       matter of general principle, we would  agree  with  the  appellant's
       submission and the respondent's concession that where the sole issue
       in an appeal is whether the Secretary of State has lawfully  revoked
       residence documentation on the ground of lack of qualification,  the
       onus to justify the cancellation is on the  revoking  authority.  It
       would be sufficient to justify such revocation if there has  been  a
       change of circumstances  since  issue  that  removes  the  right  of
       residence.

   28. However, this conclusion  does  not  contradict  the  following  two
       propositions:-
          a. In making an application for a residence document or  permanent
             right of residence  the  burden  of  demonstrating  eligibility
             falls on the applicant.
          b. The mere fact that a residence permit has been  issued  in  the
             past does not enable the applicant to satisfy the Secretary  of
             State that he has a right of  residence  at  the  time  of  the
             application,  or  that  he  exercised  a  right  of   residence
             throughout the period of the validity of the permit.


   29. However, our conclusions on this topic do not decide  the  different
       question of the evidential value of possession of a residence permit
       when a person seeks to renew it or obtain permanent residence on the
       strength of it. It is plain that if the facts reveal that  a  person
       was not exercising Treaty rights then the existence of  a  residence
       card cannot assist. It is not conclusive proof. It may, however,  be
       some evidence of past lawful status if there  is  some  evidence  to
       support the exercise of Treaty rights, nothing to contradict and the
       historic position can longer be established with precision.

     Did Mr  Sansam have a right of residence following his divorce?


   30. In this case the appellant was the spouse of an EU  national  and  a
       family member under  Article  2(2)(a)  of  the  Directive.   He  was
       therefore entitled to  the  issue  of  a  first  residence  card  on
       presentation of his valid passport,   a  marriage  certificate,  and
       "the registration certificate or any other proof of residence in the
       host Member State of the Union citizen whom they are accompanying or
       joining" (Article 10 of the Directive).



   31. He satisfied the Secretary of State of these matters  in  2002  when
       his first residence card was issued for five years  as  required  by
       Article 11 (1) of the Directive. The wife's registration certificate
       as an EU worker or self employed person would have  been  sufficient
       evidence of her status  although  other  means  of  proving  it  are
       permitted. The 2007 application form, now before us  shows  that  at
       least one wage slip for the wife was presented that  was  sufficient
       to satisfy the Home Office that the wife was continuing to  exercise
       a Treaty right as a worker and hence a further  residence  card  was
       issued for five years in November 2007. This is,  therefore,  not  a
       case of  an  applicant  arguing  that  he  can  prove  that  he  was
       exercising residence rights in 2007 merely on the strength of having
       been issued with a card in 2002.


   32. Following his divorce in  March  2007  there  were  potentially  two
       routes to the appellant retaining a right of residence under EU law:
       the retained right of residence and a right of permanent residence.

     Retained right of residence

   33. Article 13 (1) of the Directive provides for the right  of  retained
       right of residence for family members who are nationals of a  Member
       State in the event of divorce. Article  13  (2)  applies  to  family
       members who are not  nationals  of  a  Member  State,  such  as  the
       appellant and the primary qualification  route  is  subject  to  the
       fulfilment of conditions in the second sub-paragraph.

   34. In this case, the primary qualifying condition is that  set  out  in
       Article 13(2)(a):


          "prior to  the  initiation  of  the  divorce...the  marriage...has
         lasted three years, including one year in the host Member State".

       The summary of the  facts  in  the  introduction  to  this  judgment
       demonstrates that this requirement was met. The parties were married
       in the UK in 2001 and  divorce  proceedings  were  commenced  before
       October 2006 in the UK.  There is no information to suggest that the
       wife left the UK at all during this time, although only  lengthy  or
       permanent absences would have an effect on the appellant's right  of
       residence.  The reference to  marriage  does  not  mean  matrimonial
       cohabitation: (see the decision of  the  Court  of  Justice  on  the
       legislative predecessor of the right of  residence  for  spouses  in
       Diatta v Land Berlin [1985] ECR 567).

   35. The  second sub paragraph of Article 13 of the Directive provides:


         "Before acquiring the right of permanent residence,  the  right  of
         residence of the person  concerned  shall  remain  subject  to  the
         requirement that they are able to show that  they  are  workers  or
         self-employed persons or......or  that  they  are  members  of  the
         family, already constituted in the host Member State, of  a  person
         satisfying these requirements......Such family members shall retain
         their right of  residence  exclusively  on  personal  basis".  (Our
         emphasis)


   36. This language is quite compressed. Although it refers to  "permanent
       residence" it must be discussing the  retained  right  of  residence
       rather than making an advance reference to the  right  of  permanent
       residence addressed in Article 16 of the Directive. It may  well  be
       that the duration of what we shall call  "indefinite  residence"  is
       permanent  depending  on  the  circumstances  of  its   acquisition.
       Duration of Article 13 rights is, however, specifically addressed by
       Article 14, and entitlement to a permanent residence document on the
       basis of Article 13 (2) is considered in Article 18  (see  paragraph
       [3] below).


   37.  When considering whether a retained right of residence  exists  the
       person concerned must be the spouse of a former spouse who exercised
       the relevant Treaty right. The overall sense of  this  seems  to  be
       that in the case of a family member seeking to  acquire  a  retained
       right of residence, such a person must show  that  the  EU  national
       remains a worker etc at the time that  the  right  of  residence  is
       claimed to accrue (here the time of  the  divorce)  and  if  so  the
       family member (and in the case of death or  divorce,  former  family
       members) has a personal right of retained residence.


   38. Strictly, whether the wife was a worker is not the same  as  whether
       the wife was working at that time, as exemplified by Article  7  (3)
       of the Directive which provides that  the  status  of  a  worker  is
       retained if any temporary inability to  work  was  through  illness,
       accident, involuntary employment or  relevant  vocational  training.
       This is not a relevant consideration in the  present  case,  but  it
       demonstrates the dangers of drawing inferences  from  gaps  in  wage
       slips alone.

   39. Regulation 10 (5) and (6) of the  EEA  Regulations  2006  transposes
       these provisions into national law. It requires an applicant who has
       divorced to satisfy 10 (5)(a),  (b),  (c)  and  (d).  Two  of  these
       provisions require particular attention:

          a. Regulation 10(5)(b) requires the  applicant  to  show  "he  was
             residing  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  accordance  with  these
             Regulations at the date of termination".  In simple terms  this
             means that at the date of the termination of  the  marriage  he
             was residing in the UK as the spouse of an EU national who  was
             working at that date.  This correctly identifies the  focus  as
             being on the spouse's status as a worker at  the  date  of  the
             divorce.
          b.  Regulation  10(5)  (c)  requires  the  applicant  to   satisfy
             regulation 10(6).   Regulation  10(6)  imposes  two  conditions
             either one of which should be met: the 10(6)(a) requirement  is
             that the non EEA national would be a worker, self employed or a
             self sufficient  person  if  he  were  an  EEA  national.   The
             alternative requirement is 10(6)(b)  that  the  person  is  the
             family member of  a person within paragraph (a).


   40. If construed literally regulation 10(6) may give rise  to  problems.
       On divorce, a person ceases to be  a  family  member  by  reason  of
       marriage. That does not  cause  the  right  of  residence  to  cease
       however as regulation 10(5)(a) makes plain.  Family  member  with  a
       retained right of residence in regulation 10 and regulation  14  (3)
       must be a term of art and mean a person who comes within  regulation
       10(2) to (5). Further a non EEA family member does not  have  to  be
       economically active  during  the  marriage  and  nor  is  there  any
       indication in Article 13 of the  Directive  that  they  have  to  be
       economically active on their  own  account  on  termination  of  the
       marriage.


   41. In Article 13 second paragraph of the  Directive  the  reference  to
       "the person concerned" is to the  EEA  national  whose  exercise  of
       Treaty rights gives rise to a  right  of  residence  of  the  former
       family member and not the family members themselves.  It is doubtful
       whether regulation 10 (6) adds to regulation 10 (5)(b)  as  we  have
       construed it, as it is sufficient to be the former family member  of
       a person who was working at the time of the divorce.


   42. When it responded  to  the  appellant's  application  for  permanent
       residence in 2009, the Home  Office  asked  for  evidence  of  three
       issues and it was the appellant's failure  to  provide  satisfactory
       evidence of each that led to the refusal.

   43. The first thing it sought was evidence  of  one  year's  matrimonial
       cohabitation. This was an error as this is not a requirement for the
       retained right of residence under Article 13  of  the  Directive  or
       regulation 10 (5) (d) of the Regulations.  It is sufficient if  both
       spouses were  living  in  the  United  Kingdom  rather  than  living
       together in the same household in the United Kingdom.

   44. Second, it sought evidence that the wife had  worked  from  2004  to
       2007.  Our analysis of regulation 10 (5) indicates  that  the  focus
       is whether the wife retained the status of worker at the time of the
       divorce and not on whether she had that status throughout the  three
       years  preceding  the  divorce.  Where  the  Regulations  impose   a
       requirement of qualification throughout a relevant period  they  say
       so (contrast regulation 15(1)(a)). There is no such  requirement  in
       regulation 10(5).  We can see nothing in Article 13 of the  Citizens
       Directive  to  require  a  different  reading.   Further,   the   UK
       regulations can make for more favourable treatment (see  Article  37
       of the Directive) and what the regulations require the applicant  to
       satisfy the Secretary of State about is the status of the spouse  as
       working (or otherwise exercising Treaty rights) at the time  of  the
       termination of the marriage  and  not  continuously  throughout  the
       preceding three years.

   45. In any event, retaining the status of worker is not the  same  thing
       as actually working and there is no requirement on a person claiming
       a retained right of residence to retrospectively supply  wage  slips
       and related documentation  throughout  the  marriage.  If  the  Home
       Office have reason to believe that the  wife  has  been  voluntarily
       unemployed and not exercising other treaty rights  of  residence  in
       the United Kingdom and this is relevant to the grant of a  residence
       card, it can raise the issue from its own inquiries.  There  was  no
       reason here to believe that the wife has  ceased  exercising  Treaty
       rights during the currency of the appellant's residence card and for
       reasons  we  give  below  we  are  satisfied  that   the   appellant
       established that she was exercising treaty rights at the end of  it.
       We conclude that even if continuity of exercise of Treaty rights was
       a precondition for the grant of a permanent right of residence there
       was no duty on the appellant to have to prove  historic  working  by
       the wife 2004 to 2007 which was for a period before the grant of the
       second residence card.

   46. Third, it sought evidence of  the  appellant's  exercise  of  Treaty
       rights from the date of divorce to the date of the  application.  If
       this meant evidence of continuous employment we cannot see how  such
       a requirement is consistent with EU law.  If the appellant  obtained
       a retained right of residence on divorce because of the duration  of
       his marriage and his wife's status as a worker he did  not  lose  it
       subsequently because he ceased to be employed or self employed.

   47. In brief, if the Secretary of State was asking for documents that it
       was not necessary to produce to demonstrate the  retained  right  of
       residence and was imposing conditions that  the  appellant  was  not
       required to meet it cannot be a lawful conclusion that the appellant
       did not have the retained  right  of  residence  by  reason  of  his
       failure to  satisfy  the  Secretary  of  State.  The  appellant  was
       required to  demonstrate  that  he  satisfied  the  requirements  of
       regulation 10 to obtain such a right of residence and  this  he  had
       done. There was no Presenting Officer at the hearing before  the  IJ
       and  no  submission  made  that  the  evidence  of  the  appellant's
       employment post divorce was unsatisfactory  and/or  contradicted  by
       other information.

   Permanent residence
   48. Article 16 (1) affords the right of permanent residence, not subject
       to the conditions of Article  14,  to  Union  citizens  who  legally
       resided in the host Member State for a  continuous  period  of  five
       years. Thus if the appellant's wife had resided in  accordance  with
       EU law for five years as a worker she would be entitled to permanent
       residence.


   49. A similar right is afforded  under  Article  16(2)  to  non-national
       family members who have legally resided with the  Union  citizen  in
       the host Member State for a continuous period of five years.

   50. It can be noted that the  words  "resided  with"  do  not  apply  to
       spouses who are nationals of an EU state in Article  16(1).  In  the
       case of PM (EEA spouse-residing with-Turkey) [2011] UKUT 89 IAC  the
       Tribunal concluded that the term in both the Directive and  the  EEA
       Regulations meant residing  in  the  same  country  as  rather  than
       cohabitating as  spouses.  Thus  for  both  the  retained  right  of
       residence and the acquisition of the permanent  right  of  residence
       proof of cohabitation  is  not  strictly  necessary.  It  may  be  a
       relevant question to ask to rebut  any  suggestion  of  marriage  of
       convenience or that the  spouse  has  permanently  left  the  United
       Kingdom but neither issue is raised in the present case. As long  as
       both parties remain in the UK,  and  remain  married,  and  the  EEA
       spouse is exercising Treaty rights the non EA spouse obtains a right
       of residence.

   51. Here the parties were married in February 2001.  Both  were  in  the
       United Kingdom for  the  next  five  years.  The  Home  Office  were
       satisfied that the wife was exercising  Treaty  rights  by  economic
       activity in 2002 and 2007  and  issued  residence  permits  to  that
       effect. On the documents he produced he could not show that the wife
       had worked continuously for five years, although  it  may  be  in  a
       small family business no or limited wages were paid out in the early
       years. There would appear to be a case that before the date  of  the
       divorce the appellant had already  acquired  a  right  of  permanent
       residence under this route.

   52. Article 18 of the Directive provides that:


         "Without prejudice to Article 17, the family  members  of  a  Union
         citizen to whom Articles 12 (2) and 13(2) apply,  who  satisfy  the
         conditions laid down therein, shall acquire the right of  permanent
         residence after residing legally for a period of  five  consecutive
         years in the host Member State".

   53.  This provides an alternative route for  the  appellant  to  acquire
       permanent residence.  It is accurately reflected in regulation 15(f)
       of the 2006 Regulations and requires the appellant to  have  resided
       for five years in accordance with these regulations and was "at  the
       end of that period a family member who has  retained  the  right  of
       residence".  "Family member" here must mean former family member  as
       you cease to be a family member if your spouse dies or divorces you.
       Residence  in  accordance  with   these   Regulations   contemplates
       residence acquired  under  any  of  the  rights  recognised  by  the
       regulations and there is no need to have resided a continuous period
       of five years in only one category, either as a spouse or  a  former
       spouse.


   54. Thus if it could not  be  shown  that  the  appellant's  spouse  had
       continually worked for five years during the marriage, the appellant
       would appear to qualify  for permanent residence in his own right if
       he had the retained right of residence on divorce  and  nothing  has
       happened to deprive him of it.

   Error of Law
   55. There are two errors of law in this case:


               a) In so far as this was an appeal against the  decision  to
                  revoke, the IJ erred in not identifying that  the  burden
                  of justifying the revocation  was  on  the  Home  Office.
                  Although it is now clear  that  there  was  a  change  of
                  circumstance between the 2007 residence  permit  and  the
                  appellant's permanent residence application, it was not a
                  material one if the appellant in fact qualified  for  the
                  retained right of residence.
               b) In so far as this was a case concerned with  whether  the
                  appellant had a right of residence at  the  time  of  his
                  divorce and  thereafter,  the  IJ  erred  in  failing  to
                  identifying the relevant requirements for  the  right  of
                  residence. If this had  been  done  it  would  have  been
                  recognised that not everything the Home Office was asking
                  was necessary for  establishing  the  retained  right  of
                  residence.


         Both were material errors in this  case,  as  the  facts  were  not
agreed.

         We therefore set aside the decision of the IJ and remake it.

      Remaking the decision:

   56. Mr Tarlow did not disagree with any of the propositions noted  above
       when we raised them with him. He did not seek an adjournment for the
       Home Office to make investigations with the tax and social  security
       authorities as to the status of the wife or appellant.  He  made  no
       submission to the effect that false documentary  evidence  had  been
       presented by the appellant.

   57. It was clear to us by the end of the hearing that  the  wife  was  a
       worker under the Community law at the time of the divorce:-

          a. The wife had worked for the  appellant's  business  during  the
             marriage as isolated wage slips demonstrated.
          b. The Home Office had been satisfied  by  evidence  presented  to
             them in 2002 and 2007  that  the  wife  was  exercising  Treaty
             rights.
          c. The 2007 application was based on 10 hours work per week  as  a
             waitress and recent wage slip evidence was apparently  produced
             at the time to satisfy the Home Office of this.
          d. The P60 for the Year Ending April 2007 indicated that the  wife
             must have been working  for  longer  hours  and/or  higher  pay
             previously in the tax year.


   58. Here the appellant and former husband was  the  employer  and  could
       produce relevant wage slips and the Tax Code for 2007. We understand
       that the business ceased on the divorce and it may not be surprising
       that tax documents for the previous five years were not complete. We
       do not know precisely what evidence was presented to the Home Office
       in 2001/2002. We have seen nothing to positively  suggest  that  the
       wife was not a worker throughout the marriage.


   59. In marriage breakdown cases, the EEA national spouse may not wish to
       cooperate with the non-national former family  member  in  providing
       evidence of the retained right of residence. This may cause problems
       if the burden  lies  fully  on  the  applicant  in  making  a  first
       application for a  residence  document  or  permanent  residence.  A
       material consideration to whether the applicant  can  discharge  the
       burden of proof is whether the Home Office had  previously  accepted
       that the relevant person was working or otherwise exercising  Treaty
       rights. Disclosure of such applications should be made in  appellate
       proceedings  as  the  applicant  may  not  always  have  taken   the
       precaution of keeping  a  copy.  The  2007  application  has  proved
       important in determining the outcome of this case.

   60. Applying the language of regulation 10(5) to these facts:-

          a. The wife was  a  qualified  person  at  the  inception  of  the
             marriage (2002 residence permit).
          b. The appellant ceased to be the family  member  of  a  qualified
             person on divorce in March 2007.
          c. The appellant was residing in the UK  in  accordance  with  the
             Regulations as the husband of a qualified person at the time of
             the divorce as there  was  evidence  that  the  wife  had  been
             working part time throughout the previous year.
          d. Prior to the initiation of the divorce proceedings the marriage
             has lasted three years and  the  parties  had  resided  in  the
             United Kingdom during the marriage for at least a year.
          e. The Home Office were twice satisfied that  the  wife  had  been
             exercising Treaty rights  in  2002  and  2007,  and  there  was
             nothing to suggest that  satisfaction  was  based  on  material
             misconception of fact. There was some evidence  that  the  wife
             was a worker at earlier periods in the marriage
          f. At the time of the 2009 application there was evidence that the
             appellant was working. There is no  indication  that  this  was
             disputed by the Home Office  or  that  the  appellant  had  had
             recourse  to  public  funds.  If  regulation  10(6)(a)   is   a
             legitimate  requirement  the  evidence   indicates   that   the
             appellant met it, although our reading of the Directive is that
             evidence of post divorce employment is not necessary to  enable
             the non-national former spouse to acquire and keep the retained
             right of residence.


   61. The appellant has resided in the United Kingdom as the  husband  and
       former husband  of  an  EEA  national  for  nearly  10  years.  That
       residence has been under the authority of two residence permits. The
       issue of the residence permits is evidence that the Home Office  was
       satisfied that the spouse had been exercising Treaty rights in  2002
       and 2007.


   62. Although there has been a change of circumstance since the residence
       card was issued in November 2007 in our  judgment  it  is  a  not  a
       change material to the issue of whether the appellant had a retained
       right of residence on the termination of his  marriage.  Accordingly
       the residence card valid to 2012 should not have been revoked.

   63. We will remit the question of whether the appellant is now  entitled
       to a permanent residence card under  regulation  15  (1)(f)  to  the
       respondent to determine.  On the most austere view of the  facts  he
       probably does because:

          a. He resided in accordance with the Regulations as the spouse  of
             a worker from February 2006 to February 2007.
          b. He acquired the retained right of residence on divorce in March
             2007.
          c. He has resided for four subsequent years in the United  Kingdom
             with that retained right of residence to February 2011 and  has
             been employed and self-sufficient since then.
          d. He was accordingly a person  who  has  resided  in  the  United
             Kingdom in accordance with these Regulations for  a  continuous
             period of five years and at the end  of  that  period  has  the
             retained right of residence.

   64. A less austere view of the facts  may  also  be  appropriate  having
       regard to the issue of two residence cards in 2002 and 2007, and the
       total duration of the appellant's residence in the UK  as  a  spouse
       and former spouse of a qualified person. In his opinion in Dias  the
       Advocate General concluded:
         "121. In summary, it can be concluded that a period of residence of
         a Union citizen in a host Member  State,  which  is  not  based  on
         Directive 2004/38 or its predecessor  provisions,  but  only  on  a
         residence permit granted by  the  national  authorities,  does  not
         constitute legal residence within the meaning of Article  16(1)  of
         that directive and cannot therefore be taken into account  for  the
         acquisition of a right of permanent residence. It is  however  open
         to the Member States to provide for a rule according to which  such
         periods are taken into account.

         122. If a Union citizen has however resided before 30 April 2006 in
         accordance with the conditions of  the  predecessor  provisions  to
         Directive 2004/38 legally and for a continuous period of more  than
         five years in the host Member State, a right of permanent residence
         under Article 16 of Directive 2004/38 also comes into  force  where
         that residence was followed by another period of  residence  which,
         while not legal residence within the meaning of  Article  16(1)  of
         Directive 2004/38, took place on the basis of  a  valid  residence
         permit issued by the national authorities."

   65. If this opinion finds favour with the Court of Justice, or the  Home
       Office has evidence of  the  spouse's  economic  activity  prior  to
       February 2006 it is likely that the appellant acquired  a  permanent
       right of residence long before this.


   66. We are conscious that this judgment has travelled a  long  way  from
       the arguments addressed to us in the hearing, essentially on who had
       the onus of justifying revocation of  a  residence  permit.  In  our
       judgment that permit should not have been revoked  for  the  reasons
       given  by  the  Home  Office.  We  accordingly  conclude  that  that
       residence permit should now be restored to him.

   67. If it  is  now  contended  that  any  of  the  documentary  material
       presented by the  appellant  to  demonstrate  a  retained  right  of
       residence is false or that the wife is alleged not to  have  been  a
       worker throughout the marriage, and/or that despite our reasoning on
       the requirements of regulation 10  above, admittedly reached without
       the benefit of informed submissions from  the  Home  Office,  it  is
       contended that the appellant did and does not have either a retained
       or permanent right of  residence  a  fresh  decision  can  be  taken
       explaining why.

   68. In the circumstances, we will remake the decision by:-

          a. Allowing the appellant's appeal against the revocation  of  the
             appellant's 2007 residence card.
          b. Declaring the residence card remains  valid  unless  and  until
             revoked
          c. Directing that the respondent reconsider  the  application  for
             permanent residence in accordance with this judgment.
