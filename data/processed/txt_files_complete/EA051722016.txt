                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr T Ogunnubi, TM Legal Services
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

      1. Background

      2. The appellant is a national of Nigeria born on 22 January 1983.  He
         entered the UK in 2003 but his method and basis  of  entry  is  not
         specified in the papers before me. He married an EEA national on 16
         June 2010 and applied for a residence card which was granted on  20
         January 2011 for a period of five years. On 16 October 2013 he  and
         his spouse were divorced. He did not notify the respondent  of  his
         changed circumstances until 14 October 2015  when  he  applied  for
         retained rights of residence and a permanent residence card.

      3. The respondent refused his application on  22  April  2016  on  the
         basis that he had failed to provide evidence that he had resided in
         the UK in accordance with the Regulations for a  five-year  period.
         His appeal against that decision was dismissed  on  the  papers  by
         First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Chambers  by  way  of  a  determination
         promulgated on 23 August 2016.

      4. The appellant obtained leave. He argues that the judge was wrong to
         require the appellant's  former  spouse  to  have  been  exercising
         treaty rights for five years up to the date of the divorce and also
         that the evidence was sufficient to show that she  had  been  self-
         employed.

      5. The Hearing

      6. The appellant was in attendance at the  hearing  before  me  on  16
         January 2017. I heard submissions from Mr Ogunnubi and Mr Jarvis.

      7. Mr Ogunnubi submitted that there  was  no  requirement  within  the
         Regulations for a former spouse to show five years of work and that
         the judge  erred  in  this  respect.  He  submitted  that  adequate
         evidence of the spouse's work had been adduced; specifically, there
         were profit and loss accounts and tax returns.  He  relied  on  the
         judgments in Samsam (EEA: revocation  and  retained  rights)  Syria
         [2011] UKUT 00165 (IAC) and Amos [2011] EWCA Crim  552.  He  argued
         that the judge had simply repeated the respondent's  reasoning.  He
         argued that the respondent's Rule 24  response  had  been  received
         late and should not be admitted.

      8. Mr Jarvis replied. He accepted that under reg.  10,  the  appellant
         could rely on periods both prior and subsequent to his  divorce  in
         order to make up the continuous five-years required  but  submitted
         that if the judge was right in his assessment that the  appellant's
         former spouse had not established that she  was  exercising  treaty
         rights in the UK, then the appellant's employment post-divorce  was
         irrelevant and could not be taken into account.

      9.  Mr  Ogunnubi  responded  briefly.  He  submitted  that  there  was
         sufficient evidence to show that the  spouse  had  been  exercising
         treaty rights.

     10. That completed the submissions. Both  parties  agreed  that  if  an
         error of law were to be found, the decision could be re-made by the
         Upper Tribunal without the need for a further hearing.

     11. At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my determination  which
         I now give.

     12. Error of Law

     13. There is agreement between the parties that  the  continuous  five-
         year period required by the Regulations can cover time  both  prior
         and subsequent to the appellant's divorce. The judge was  therefore
         wrong when he assessed  the  evidence  with  a  view  to  assessing
         whether the sponsor had completed  a  five-year  period  under  the
         Regulations up until the time of the divorce.

     14. It was also argued for the  appellant  that  the  judge  had  given
         inadequate or no reasons  for  his  findings  and  had  essentially
         rubber stamped the decision of the respondent.  I  have  considered
         the findings at paragraphs 10 and 11. Submissions were only made on
         those contained at paragraph 11 and which relate  to  the  spouse's
         self-employment. Whilst the judge finds that the evidence  provided
         an incomplete picture and was insufficient to demonstrate that  the
         EEA spouse was exercising treaty rights,  there  is  no  engagement
         with the evidence and no reference to what the deficiencies in  the
         evidence may be. It is fair to say, as the appellant  argues,  that
         the judge has just agreed with the respondent without any  analysis
         of his own. The inadequacy of reasoning is also an error of law.

     15. As the judge has been found to have made errors of law and as these
         are material to the outcome, I  set  aside  the  decision  and  now
         proceed to re-make it on the evidence provided and as both  parties
         agreed I should.

     16. Findings and conclusions

     17. Under Regulations 10 and 15, the appellant must show  that  he  has
         resided in  the  UK  in  accordance  with  the  Regulations  for  a
         continuous five-year period;  i.e.  that  his  former  spouse  (the
         sponsor) had exercised free movement rights  up  to  the  point  of
         divorce and that  he,  the  appellant,  had  been  employed,  self-
         employed or sufficient since then. Collectively, this evidence must
         cover a five-year period so as to meet  the  requirements  of  reg.
         15(1)(f).

     18. The marriage took place on 16 June 2010 and the decree absolute was
         issued on 16 October 2013.  The appellant  states  in  his  witness
         statement that his wife worked from 2010 up  to  the  date  of  the
         divorce. I have, therefore,  considered  the  evidence  before  the
         judge of the sponsor's self-employment during that period and which
         I was referred to by Mr Ogunnubi. This consists of copies of:

             Unaudited accounts for the year ending 5 April 2011

             Unaudited accounts for the year ending 5 April 2012

             Unaudited accounts for the year ending 5 April 2013

             Unaudited accounts for the year ending 5 April 2014

             Tax return for the year ending 5 April 2011 showing an  annual
             turnover of �6125

             Tax return for the year ending 5 April 2012 showing an  annual
             turnover of �6311

             Tax return for the year ending 5 April 2013 showing an  annual
             turnover of �6518

             Tax return for the year ending 5 April 2011 showing an  annual
             turnover of �12005.

     19. I was not referred to any other evidence to show that  the  sponsor
         was exercising treaty rights during the period up to her divorce. A
         calculation of tax was submitted at the hearing for the year  2014-
         2015 but this is not pertinent to the issue at  hand  as  it  post-
         dates the divorce.

     20. I have considered the documentary evidence set out above but am not
         satisfied that  it  is  reliable  evidence  that  the  sponsor  was
         exercising treaty rights.  The unaudited accounts are simply  typed
         statements. They are unsigned and there  is  no  confirmation  that
         they were prepared by a firm of accountants. As such, I  give  them
         little weight. The tax returns are no more  than  completed  forms.
         There is no evidence to show they were ever submitted  to  HMRC  or
         indeed that the tax owed was paid. They also carry little weight. I
         was not referred to any other evidence. In her decision letter, the
         respondent referred to many documents that could have been  adduced
         to prove self-employment but the appellant does not appear to  have
         taken that on board when compiling his bundle and it has  not  been
         suggested that he is on bad terms with his  former  spouse  or  was
         unable to obtain evidence from her. I, therefore, conclude that the
         evidence in the appellant's bundle fails to  demonstrate  that  the
         sponsor was exercising treaty rights between 2010 and October 2013.



     21. It follows that the employment of the appellant subsequent  to  the
         divorce  (of  which  substantially  more  documentary  evidence  is
         adduced) is insufficient  to  make  out  the  requirements  of  the
         Regulations. It has to be added to a period of work by the  sponsor
         and  as  that   has   not   been   established,   the   appellant's
         employment/self-employment does not assist him.

     22. I was not addressed on the issue of cohabitation but as the  appeal
         fails for the reasons set out above, there is no  need  to  venture
         into that matter.

     23. Decision

     24. The judge made errors of law and the decision is set aside.  I  re-
         make it and dismiss the appeal.
