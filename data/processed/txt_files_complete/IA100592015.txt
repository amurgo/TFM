                        (No anonymity direction made)

                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     -
For the Respondent:    Mr G. Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting
                       Officer

                                   NOTICE

 1. The Appellant is a national of the Pakistan date  of  birth  25th  July
    1987.


 2. On the 27th July  2015  the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowed  his  appeal
    against a decision to refuse to vary his leave to remain and to  remove
    him from the United Kingdom.

 3. On the 13th April 2016 I found that decision to contain errors  of  law
    such that it was set aside: my error of law decision is attached.   The
    matter was to be listed before me in order that  I  could  re-make  the
    decision in the appeal.

 4. On the 18th May 2016 the Appellant's representatives wrote  to  request
    that the appeal  be  withdrawn.  As  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had been set aside, the Appellant's appeal was outstanding. In
    the absence of any objection from the Respondent, and having regard  to
    rule 17 of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  I
    consent to the appeal being withdrawn. There is no  outstanding  appeal
    before the Tribunal.

                                                               25th May 2016
