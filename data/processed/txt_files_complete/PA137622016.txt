Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Wilkins, Counsel instructed by direct access
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a national of Iraq born in 1988. His dependents  are
       his wife and child. He appeals with permission the  decision  of  the
       First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Mathews)  to  dismiss  his   protection
       appeal[1].

    2. The substance of the Appellant's case is that he faces a well-founded
       fear of persecution in his home  area  of  Iraq,  the  Iraqi  Kurdish
       Region (IKR). He claims to have  encountered  difficulties  with  the
       authorities in Sulaymaniyah on account of his  political  activities,
       in particular publishing poetry critical of the government. He claims
       to have been a supporter of 'Gorran', the 'Change Party'.  He further
       claims that he and his wife have received threats from the family  of
       her ex-husband, a violent and abusive man whom  she  divorced  before
       she married the Appellant.

    3. The First-tier Tribunal rejected the account given in respect of both
       limbs of the Appellant's case.

    4. Ms Wilkins makes several complaints about the approach  taken  but  I
       need not deal with any of them in great detail since her  submissions
       went unopposed by Mr Diwnycz.   The errors identified are:

             i) The determination states [at �32] that the claimed  fear  of
                the Appellant's wife's  family  was  not  mentioned  in  the
                Appellant's  screening  or  asylum  interview,  and  adverse
                inference is accordingly drawn from the late mention of this
                evidence. It is accepted by the Respondent that this  is  an
                error of fact. It is accepted that the Appellant did mention
                this element of his claim in his screening interview  [�4.1]
                and in his asylum interview where he gives a full account of
                him and his wife having to move to  avoid  the  family,  and
                then being found  at  their  place  of  internal  relocation
                [�Q183-202].

            ii) The determination further states that the  Appellant  failed
                to explain why his wife's former family did not take  direct
                action against him and his wife. It is again  accepted  that
                this is an error, and a failure to  take  material  evidence
                into account. The account  given  at  paragraph  27  of  the
                Appellant's  witness  statement  explains  that   when   the
                aggressors came to the family home  the  Appellant  and  his
                wife were not there.

           iii)  The  determination  fails  to  have  any  regard   to   the
                unchallenged documentary  evidence  from  ASUDA,  a  women's
                refuge where the Appellant's wife stayed after she fled  her
                abusive husband.

            iv) In reaching its decision the First-tier Tribunal  failed  to
                have regard to the relevant country background  evidence  on
                sufficiency  of  protection  in  the  KRI,   in   particular
                paragraph 4.1 of the Respondent's CPIN The Kurdistan  Region
                of Iraq: Access, Possibility  of  Protection,  Security  and
                Humanitarian Situation.

    5. I am  satisfied  that  the  alleged  errors  are  made  out.  In  its
       consideration of the second limb of the Appellant's case  the  First-
       tier Tribunal has failed to have  regard  to  material  evidence  and
       found discrepancy where in fact there was none. As to  whether  those
       errors infected the decision overall, the  answer  is  found  at  �33
       where the Tribunal makes clear that its assessment has been a rounded
       and holistic one: "when I view all matters above in  the  context  of
       the entire body of evidence before me, I find  a  number  of  matters
       that reflect adversely on  the  credibility  of  the  appellant".  It
       follows that the entire determination must be set aside. The  parties
       agree that the  most  appropriate  disposal  would  be  remittal  for
       hearing de novo in the First-tier Tribunal.

    Anonymity Order

    6. This case involves a claim for international protection.  Having  had
       regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
       2008 and the Presidential Guidance  Note  No  1  of  2013:  Anonymity
       Orders, I therefore consider it appropriate to make an order  in  the
       following terms:

           "Unless and until a tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
           Appellant is granted anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings
           shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member  of  his
           family.  This direction applies to,  amongst  others,  both  the
           Appellants and the Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
           direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"

    Decisions

    7. The making of the First-tier Tribunal decision involved an  error  in
       approach such that the decision is set aside.

    8. The decision is to be remade do novo in the First-tier Tribunal.

    9. There is an order for anonymity.
