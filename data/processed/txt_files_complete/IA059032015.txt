Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. S Nwaekwu, Solicitor, Moorehouse Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr. L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The First-tier Tribunal made an anonymity order.  Pursuant to  Rule  14
    of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI  2008/269)  I
    make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal or a  Court  directs
    otherwise, no report of these proceedings or any  form  of  publication
    thereof shall directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  appellant.  This
    direction applies to, amongst  others,  all  parties.  Any  failure  to
    comply with this  direction  could  give  rise  to  contempt  of  court
    proceedings.


 2. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Wyman promulgated on 4th July 2016.  The underlying decision  that  was
    the subject of the  appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  the
    decision of the respondent dated 7th February 2015 to  refuse  to  vary
    the appellant's leave to remain in the UK.


 3. The appellant is a citizen of Tanzania.  He first  entered  the  UK  on
    16th October 2004 as  a  student.   In  November  2011,  the  appellant
    claimed asylum and although the  claim  for  asylum  was  refused,  the
    appellant was granted discretionary leave to remain in  the  UK,  until
    15th December 2014.  The grant of discretionary leave to remain in  the
    UK was made to the appellant because the respondent accepted  that  the
    appellant has a family life in the UK with his daughter, who  was  born
    on 16th November 2010. The relationship between the appellant  and  the
    mother of his daughter ("Miss M") had  ended,  but  the  appellant  was
    having regular direct contact with his daughter.


 4. By the time of the appellant's application for a variation of his leave
    to remain in the UK on 5th December 2014,  the  position  had  changed.
    The appellant had not had any contact with his daughter for a period of
    about  a  year.   The  appellant's  application  was  refused  by   the
    respondent for the reasons set out in  her  decision  of  7th  February
    2015.


The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Wyman


 5. The appellant's immigration history is set out at paragraphs [3] to [5]
    of the decision of First-tier Tribunal Wyman.   At  paragraphs  [8]  to
    [16] of her decision, the Judge sets out the appellant's case,  and  at
    paragraphs  [17]  to  [19],  the  Judge  sets  out  a  summary  of  the
    respondent's decision.  At paragraphs [24] to [32], the Judge sets  out
    the evidence of the appellant. At paragraph [34], the  Judge  sets  out
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules, as in force as at  the  date
    of the hearing before her. The findings and conclusions  of  the  Judge
    are to be found at paragraphs [35] to [46] of her decision.


 6. The Judge did not find the appellant to be  a  credible  witness.   She
    found him to be evasive and found that he minimised key issues  in  his
    oral evidence.


 7. At paragraph [37] of the decision, the Judge refers to a memorandum  of
    understanding  that  records  the  arrangements  agreed   between   the
    appellant and Miss M when they entered mediation in September 2015, for
    contact between the appellant  and  his  daughter.  The  memorandum  of
    understanding records that the appellant's daughter  resides  with  her
    mother and "..will not have direct contact with the  appellant  at  the
    present time."   The  memorandum  of  understanding  records  that  the
    appellant will write to his daughter once a week for three  weeks,  and
    after that, he will telephone her once a week, if the  initial  contact
    by letter progresses well. The memorandum of understanding also records
    that the appellant agreed that he owes Miss M �3000, and that  he  will
    repay this amount at the rate of �300 a month, until it is repaid.


 8. At paragraph [37] of her decision, the Judge refers to the evidence  of
    the appellant who claimed that he did not understand what was meant  in
    the memorandum of understanding when it records that he would only have
    indirect  contact  with  his  daughter.   The   Judge   rejected   that
    explanation.


 9. At  paragraph  [38]  of  her  decision,  the  Judge  records  that  the
    appellant's  daughter  is  a  British  citizen.   She  found  that  the
    requirements of paragraph E-LTRPT.2.2 are met.  At paragraphs [39]  and
    [40] of her decision, the Judge considers whether paragraph E-LTRPT.2.3
    of Appendix FM is met.  The Judge concluded that it is unclear  whether
    the requirement is met because it is unclear whether Miss M,  a  Slovak
    national, is "settled in  the  UK".   There  was  no  evidence  of  her
    immigration status before the Judge.   At  paragraphs  [41]  the  Judge
    states:


             "the appellant must also provide evidence that he  has  either
             sole parental responsibility for the child or access rights to
             the child. It is clear that the appellant has neither.  It  is
             not in dispute the  appellant  does  not  have  sole  parental
             responsibility for his daughter. He has not seen his  daughter
             (except at mediation) since December 2014 -  a period of  some
             18 months."


10. At paragraph [42] of her  decision  the  Judge  notes  the  appellant's
    extant application for contact that is now before  the  Family  Courts.
    At paragraph [45] of her decision, the Judge concludes:


             "The appellant also needs to  prove  that  he  is  taking  and
             intends to continue to  take  an  active  role  in  the  child
             upbringing.  It  is  clear  that  since  December  2014,   the
             appellant has not taken any  active  role  whatsoever  in  his
             daughter's upbringing. Whilst I note it may not have been  his
             choice that contact was reduced or suspended, the delay in the
             appellant bringing any proceedings for contact (following  the
             mediation) I find to be significant  and  therefore  I  cannot
             find that the appellant  has  taken  an  active  role  in  the
             child's bringing."


11. The Judge concluded  at  paragraph  [46]  of  her  decision,  that  the
    appellant cannot meet the requirements of  paragraph  E-LTRPT.2.4,  and
    questioned whether the appellant can meet the requirement of  paragraph
    E-LTRPT.2.3.


The grounds of appeal


12. The appellant advances four grounds of appeal. First,  there  had  been
    evidence before the respondent and the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
    appellant had been making child support  payments  to  his  ex-partner.
    The Judge erred by not taking this evidence into account when assessing
    whether the appellant is taking, and intends to  continue  to  take  an
    active role in his daughter's upbringing, and thus whether he meets the
    requirements of paragraph E-LTRPT.2.4(b).  Second, the Judge  erred  in
    deciding the appeal under the immigration rules with  no  reference  to
    the arrangements that are recorded in the memorandum  of  understanding
    dated 26th March 2015.  The arrangements as set out in  the  memorandum
    of understanding are capable of satisfying  the  requirement  that  the
    appellant has access rights to the child.  That was the requirement set
    out at E-LTRPT.2.4(a)(ii) at the date of the hearing before the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  Third, the judge failed to  carry  out  any  assessment
    under Article 8 and fourth, the Judge failed to have any or any  proper
    regard to the best interests of  the  child  and  the  duty  under  s55
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.


  13. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Jackson  on
      28th November 2016.  The matter comes before me  to  consider  whether
      the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  a
      material error of law, and if so, to remake the decision.   Directions
      were issued to the parties on 7th December 2016 making it clear to the
      parties that there is a presumption that in the event of the  Tribunal
      deciding that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  to  be  set
      aside as erroneous in law, the remaking  of  the  decision  will  take
      place  at  the  same  hearing  and  the  parties  must   be   prepared
      accordingly.


14. Before me, Mr Nwaekwu submits that the Judge failed to consider Article
    8 at all, and that the matter should  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a proper consideration of the appeal on Article 8 grounds.
     He submits that the Judge erroneously failed to  apply  the  rules  in
    force as at the date of the hearing. He submits  that  the  requirement
    that now applies at paragraph  E-LTRPT.2.4(a)(ii),  that  an  applicant
    must provide evidence that they have direct access (in person)  to  the
    child, did not apply at the date of the  hearing.   Previously  it  was
    sufficient for an appellant to provide evidence that they  have  access
    rights to the child.  Mr Nwaekwu relies upon the decision of the  Upper
    Tribunal in JA  -v-  SSHD  [2015]  UKUT  00225(IAC)  and  submits  that
    "access" may refer equally to parents who have "indirect" access  to  a
    child, as here, by means of letters, and telephone calls.


15. Mr Nwaekwu submits that the Judge  erred  in  failing  to  have  proper
    regard to the evidence that was before the Tribunal  of  child  support
    payments.  He submits that if the Judge  had  properly  considered  the
    evidence of child support payments being made  by  the  appellant,  the
    Judge would have been satisfied that the appellant is  contributing  to
    his daughter's upbringing  and  would  have  been  satisfied  that  the
    appellant is taking, and intends to continue to take an active role  in
    the child's upbringing as required by paragraph E-LTRPT.2.4(b).


16. Mr Nwaekwu submits that the Judge failed to have any regard to the best
    interests of the child.  He submits that the  starting  point  must  be
    that it is in the child's best interests to have  a  good  relationship
    with both of her parents.  He accepts that there was no evidence before
    the First-tier Tribunal of any impact that  removal  of  the  appellant
    from the UK, would have upon his daughter, given  the  limited  contact
    that he has, as set out in the Memorandum of Understanding.


17. Mr Nwaekwu relies upon the decision of the Upper  Tribunal  in  PD  and
    Others (Article 8) -v- SSHD and submits that if there is a family  life
    between the appellant and his daughter, his removal from the  UK  would
    be disproportionate.


18. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Tarlow  adopts  the  Rule  24  response
    filed  by  the  respondent.   He  submits  that   the   memorandum   of
    understanding makes it clear that the appellant  has  indirect  contact
    only, and that the Judge properly recognised that the lack  of  contact
    may not be entirely down to the choice of the  appellant.   He  submits
    that the Judge reached findings and conclusions that were properly open
    to her on the evidence, and that there is no material error of  law  in
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.


Discussion


19. The Judge  plainly  considered  whether  the  appellant  satisfied  the
    requirements for further leave to remain as a parent, through the prism
    of the Immigration Rules as set in Appendix FM.  That  is  the  correct
    approach.  Although the Judge expresses some reservations as to whether
    the appellant  can  meet  the  requirement  of  paragraph  E-LTRPT.2.3,
    because of the paucity of evidence before her  as  to  the  immigration
    status of Miss N, I am satisfied from a careful reading of the decision
    that the Judge did not dismiss the appeal because of any  concern  that
    the requirement of paragraph E-LTRPT.2.3 was not met.


20. The issue before me is whether it was open to the Judge to find, as she
    did at paragraph [45] of her decision, that since  December  2014,  the
    appellant has not taken any active role whatsoever  in  his  daughter's
    upbringing. The Judge  noted  that  that  it  may  not  have  been  the
    appellant's choice that contact was reduced or suspended.  However, she
    found the delay in the appellant bringing any proceedings  for  contact
    following mediation, to be significant and found that the appellant had
    not taken an active role in the child's upbringing.


21. I reject the submission made on behalf of the appellant that the  Judge
    applied the wrong rule and failed to consider the evidence of the child
    support payments made by the appellant.  As at the date of the  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal, it is right to say  that  paragraph  E-
    LTRPT.2.4(a)(ii) required that an applicant must provide evidence  that
    they have access rights to the child.  Although the Judge sets  out  at
    paragraph [34]  of  her  decision,  the  revised  version  of  rule  E-
    LTRPT.2.4(a)(ii), at paragraph [41] of her decision, the  Judge  refers
    to the version in force as at the date of  the  hearing.   She  states:
    "The appellant must also provide  evidence  that  he  has  either  sole
    parental responsibility for the child or access rights to the  child.".
    The Judge did not refer to "direct access (in person) to the child", as
    is required in the revised version of the rules.


22. In any event, there remained the additional requirement that is set out
    at E-LTRPT.2.4(b) that an applicant must provide evidence that they are
    taking, and intend to continue to take, an active role in  the  child's
    upbringing.  It is in my judgment  plain  from  a  careful  reading  of
    paragraphs [41] to [45] of the decision that the  Judge  dismissed  the
    appeal under the rules because she was not satisfied that the appellant
    is taking, and intends to continue to  take,  an  active  role  in  the
    child's upbringing.


23. I reject the submission that in  reaching  her  conclusion,  the  Judge
    failed to have proper regard to the child support payments  being  made
    by the appellant.  At paragraph [28] of the decision the Judge  records
    the �3000 maintenance payment that was referred to in the memorandum of
    understanding.  She also  records  the  appellant's  evidence  that  he
    believed that he had now paid all the outstanding maintenance.  At  the
    hearing before me, Mr Nwaekwu submitted that there was evidence  before
    the First-tier Tribunal of the  child  support  payments  made  by  the
    appellant.   There  were  indeed  a  number  of  wage  slips  and  bank
    statements contained in the appellant's  bundle  that  showed  payments
    made for child support.  The following payments are evidenced:

|Date    |Amount of child support |Page Ref |

|26.05.16|�200.00                 |33       |


24. The majority of the payments evidenced in the  appellant's  bundle  are
    payments  made  before  the  memorandum  of  understanding  dated   8th
    September 2015.  As at that date, the appellant  acknowledged  that  he
    owed �3000.  He agreed to repay that amount  at  the  rate  of  �300  a
    month.   The  evidence  that  was  before   the   First-tier   Tribunal
    established that the appellant had paid only a limited amount from what
    was already owed.


25. The Judge was plainly aware of the decision of the Upper Tribunal in JA
    -v- SSHD [2015] UKUT 00225.  It is set out at  paragraph  [33]  of  the
    decision.  In my judgement, the appellant gains no assistance from that
    decision.  Mr Nwaekwu relies upon the second and third headnotes to the
    decision.  He  submits  that  "access  rights",  encompasses  as  here,
    circumstances in which there is no direct contact between a parent  and
    child.  He submits that the Tribunal held in JA, that parents who  have
    "indirect" access without there being a court order, as  the  appellant
    does by means of telephone calls and letters, fall within the  criteria
    of the rules.  Mr Nwaekwu overlooks the fourth headnote that states:


             "Having satisfied the requirements  of  paragraph  E-LTRPT.2.4
             (a) (i), an appellant must still prove that he/she "is  taking
             and intend to continue to take an active role in  the  child's
             upbringing"  (paragraph  E-LTRPT.2.4(a)(ii)).  Whether  he/she
             will be able to do so will depend  upon  the  evidence  rather
             than the nature of the "access rights". However, it is  likely
             to be unusual that a  person  having  only  "indirect"  access
             rights will be able to satisfy this provision. In some  cases,
             Tribunals may need to examine the reasons why the Family Court
             has ordered "indirect" rather than "direct" access"


26. The Judge records at paragraph [25] of her decision that the  appellant
    is still not having any direct contact with his daughter.  In fact, the
    appellant was not even having  the  telephone  contact  that  had  been
    anticipated in the memorandum of understanding.


27. In considering whether the findings of the Judge and in particular  the
    conclusion at paragraph [45] of her decision was open to the  Judge,  I
    remind myself that the Court of Appeal in R & ors (Iran) v SSHD  [2005]
    EWCA Civ 982 held that a finding might only be set aside for  error  of
    law on the grounds of perversity if it was irrational  or  unreasonable
    in the Wednesbury sense, or one that  was  wholly  unsupported  by  the
    evidence.  In my judgment, the findings and  conclusion  of  the  Judge
    were properly open to her on the evidence and it was open to the  Judge
    to find  that  the  appellant  cannot  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.


28. That is not the end of the matter because  the  appellant  had  in  his
    grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal raised Article 8.   Having
    dismissed the appeal because she was satisfied that the  appellant  did
    not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules, the Judge  did  not
    go on to consider the Article 8 claim or  the  best  interests  of  the
    child.  Although the decision of the Judge to dismiss the appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules cannot be criticised, in my judgement, the  Judge
    erred in failing to consider the Article 8 ground of appeal.


29. Directions were issued to the parties in advance of the hearing  before
    me requiring the parties to prepare for the hearing on the basis  that,
    if the Upper Tribunal decides to set aside  the  determination  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal as erroneous in law, the remaking of  the  decision
    will take place at the  same  hearing.  Despite  the  reminder  in  the
    directions that a failure to comply with Rules 15(2A) will be  regarded
    as a serious matter and may result in fresh  or  further  evidence  not
    being considered by the Tribunal, no application has been made pursuant
    to rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.


  30. I therefore decide the Article 8 claim based upon  the  evidence  that
      was before the First-tier Tribunal, taking as I must, the findings  of
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge  that  the  appellant  cannot  meet  the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules, as my  starting  point.   As  I
      have said the findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge were  properly
      open to her, and the findings made, are preserved.  It is now a  well-
      established general principle that in Article  8  ECHR  cases,  it  is
      appropriate for the decision maker and, on  appeal,  the  Tribunal  to
      consider first whether  the  person's  claim  satisfies  the  relevant
      requirements of the Rules.  In SSHD -v- SS  (Congo)  &  Others  [2015]
      EWCA Civ 387, the Court of Appeal in a judgment handed  down  by  Lord
      Justice Richards, stated;


         "..The proper approach should always be  to  identify,  first,  the
         substantive content of the relevant Immigration Rules, both to  see
         if an applicant for LTR or LTE satisfies the conditions  laid  down
         in those Rules (so as to be entitled  to  LTR  or  LTE  within  the
         Rules) and to  assess  the  force  of  the  public  interest  given
         expression in those rules (which will be relevant to the  balancing
         exercise under Article 8, in deciding whether LTR or LTE should  be
         granted outside the substantive provisions set out in  the  Rules).
         Secondly, if an applicant does not satisfy the requirements in  the
         substantive part of the Rules, they may seek to  maintain  a  claim
         for grant of LTR or LTE outside the substantive provisions  of  the
         Rules, pursuant to Article 8. If there  is  a  reasonably  arguable
         case under Article 8 which has not already been sufficiently  dealt
         with by consideration of  the  application  under  the  substantive
         provisions  of  the  Rules  (cf  Nagre  ,  para.  [30]),  then   in
         considering that case the individual interests of the applicant and
         others whose Article 8 rights  are  in  issue  should  be  balanced
         against the public interest, including as expressed in  the  Rules,
         in order to make an assessment whether refusal to grant LTR or LTE,
         as the case may be,  is  disproportionate  and  hence  unlawful  by
         virtue of section 6(1) of the HRA read with Article 8."; [44]


31. In  his  submissions,  Mr  Nwaekwu  submits  that  notwithstanding  the
    appellant's failure to meet the requirements of the immigration  rules,
    there is plainly a family life that has been  established  between  the
    appellant and his  daughter.   He  submits  that  the  removal  of  the
    appellant is disproportionate  to  any  legitimate  aim  sought  to  be
    achieved.  He submits that the circumstances are exceptional such  that
    the appeal should be  allowed  on  Article  8  grounds.   He  draws  my
    attention, in particular to paragraphs [27] and [43] of the decision of
    the Upper Tribunal in PD and  Others  (Article  8  -  conjoined  family
    claims) Sri Lanka [2016] UKUT 00108 (IAC).   I derive little assistance
    from that decision because it is a decision in which the Upper Tribunal
    provided guidance in respect of conjoined  Article  8  ECHR  claims  of
    multiple family members. This appeal does  not  concern  the  conjoined
    Article 8 claims of  multiple  family  members  in  the  way  that  was
    considered by the Tribunal in PD and Others.


32. In reaching my decision, I have had careful regard to  the  duty  under
    section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration  Act  2009  and
    note that the best interests of the  appellant's  daughter  must  be  a
    primary consideration.  I have also had regard to the matters  now  set
    out in section 117B of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002.


33. S55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009  requires  the
    respondent to make arrangements for  ensuring  that  her  functions  in
    relation to immigration, asylum or nationality  are  discharged  having
    regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who
    are in the UK.  In E-A (Article 8-  best  interest  of  child)  Nigeria
    [2011] UKUT 315 (lAC) it was held that the correct  starting  point  in
    considering the welfare and best interest of a  young  child  would  be
    that it is in the best interest of a child to live with, and be brought
    up by his or her parents, subject to any very strong contra-indication.
     Here, the appellant does not have any contact, even indirect  contact,
    with his daughter let alone live with his daughter.


34. There is no question of the appellant's daughter being removed from the
    UK, or being separated from her primary  carer,  her  mother.   As  Mr.
    Nwaekwu conceded, in my judgment rightly given the present state of the
    evidence, there is no evidence at all that the refusal of further leave
    to remain or the removal from the UK of the  appellant  will  have  any
    impact upon his daughter, let alone any adverse impact.  That  must  be
    right given that the appellant does not even have the telephone contact
    with  his  daughter  that  was   envisaged   in   the   memorandum   of
    understanding.


35. The legitimate aim set out in Article 8(2) must now also be read in the
    light of s117B  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,  and
    particularly sub-paragraph (1) which  holds  that  the  maintenance  of
    effective immigration  controls  is  in  the  public  interest.   I  am
    required to carry out a balancing exercise considering all the facts of
    the case, but also giving regard to s117B of  the  2002  Act.   Section
    117B(6) of the 2002 Act provides that in the case of a  person  who  is
    not liable to deportation, the public interest  does  not  require  the
    person's removal where; (a) the person has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with a qualifying child, and (b) it would not  be
    reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    appellant's daughter is a qualifying child.


36. The two tests enshrined in section 117B(6) are  to  be  considered  and
    applied together.  I find that  the  first  test,  namely  whether  the
    appellant has genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship  with  his
    daughter is not met.  On the evidence before me, the appellant does not
    even have the telephone contact with his daughter, that  was  envisaged
    in the memorandum of  understanding.   There  is  no  evidence  of  any
    progress having been made upon the  application  for  contact  that  is
    before the Family Court. Aaugmenting the findings made  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge, I find that the appellant does not have a  genuine
    and subsisting parental relationship with his daughter.  Thus,  on  the
    facts and findings here, the appellant cannot meet the first test.


37. Save for the extant application for contact that is before  the  Family
    Court, Mr Nwaekwu was  unable  to  identify  any  arguable  case  under
    Article 8 which  has  not  already  been  sufficiently  dealt  with  by
    consideration of the application under the  substantive  provisions  of
    the Immigration Rules.  As I have said above, there is no  evidence  of
    any progress having been made upon the application for contact that  is
    before the Family Court.


38. Having carefully considered the evidence I find  that  the  refusal  of
    leave to remain and removal of the appellant  would  not  amount  to  a
    disproportionate interference with the appellant's right  to  a  family
    and or private life.


39. The appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules was dismissed by the
    First-tier Tribunal.  I do not set aside that decision.  The First-tier
    Tribunal Judge erred in failing to consider the  appeal  on  Article  8
    grounds.  I have considered the appeal on Article  8  grounds  and  the
    appeal is dismissed.


DECISION


40. The decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  stands  insofar  it
    dismisses the appellant's appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    findings of fact made by the First-tier Tribunal are preserved.


41. The First-tier Tribunal erred in failing to  consider  the  appellant's
    appeal on Article 8 grounds.


42. I dismiss the appeal on Article 8 grounds.


43. An anonymity direction was made by the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  that
    direction shall continue.
