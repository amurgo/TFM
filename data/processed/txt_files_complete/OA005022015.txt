Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Jafar, instructed by Eden Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is an appeal by the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
   (SSHD). For the purposes of this decision, I shall refer to the  SSHD  as
   the respondent and  Mr  Ul  Badar  as  the  appellant,  reflecting  their
   positions as they were in the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.

2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan,  born  on  13  October  1990.  He
   applied for entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom  as  a  spouse  under
   paragraph  EC-P.1.1  of  Appendix  FM  of  the  immigration  rules.   His
   application was refused on 20 November 2014 on the grounds that he  could
   not meet the financial requirements in paragraph E-ECP.3.1 since  he  had
   not provided the specified evidence required under Appendix FM-SE of  the
   immigration rules to demonstrate that his sponsor's gross  annual  income
   met the level required under the rules. The  respondent  noted  that  the
   appellant was relying upon the sponsor's gross annual income from �14,153
   from employment with Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, together with
   her earnings of �5,471 from her self-employment as a designer and tailor,
   but considered that the required specified evidence had not been produced
   for either.

3. The appellant lodged an appeal against that decision, claiming  that  the
   specified evidence had been provided.


4. In response to the appeal the respondent,  in  an  ECM  Review,  accepted
   that  the  specified  evidence  had  been  provided  to  demonstrate  the
   sponsor's salaried employment. However, with regard to  the  income  from
   self-employment, the respondent  noted  that  whilst  the  sponsor's  tax
   return stated that she had self-employment income  of  �5,471,  her  bank
   statements showed hardly  any  money  going  into  the  account  and  not
   sufficient to suggest an income of �5,471. The respondent was  not  able,
   therefore, to include the self-employment income and as such  the  income
   from employment did not meet the required threshold under the immigration
   rules. The respondent therefore maintained the decision. The  respondent,
   furthermore, did not consider that the decision  was  in  breach  of  the
   appellant's Article 8 rights.

5. The appellant's appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal on  8  October
   2015.  The  only  additional  evidence  not  already  contained  in   the
   respondent's bundle consisted of a witness statement from the sponsor. In
   that statement, the sponsor stated that the ECM had acknowledged that she
   had produced all the required  evidence  with  her  application  but  had
   raised a new issue, namely that her self-employment income had  not  been
   paid into her account. She explained that that was due to the  fact  that
   she kept the cash generated through her tailoring business to pay for her
   day to day expenses. She had kept a record  of  all  her  self-employment
   earnings which had been provided to her accountant, who had then prepared
   her annual accounts. Her tax liability  had  then  been  calculated  from
   those accounts. The sponsor stated that the ECM should  have  taken  into
   account that her self-employment business was  a  very  low  scale,  side
   business and she did not earn large amounts from it. She  therefore  used
   the cash rather than banking it. The sponsor then went on to explain that
   she had a family life  with  the  appellant  which  was  protected  under
   Article 8 and that she could not relocate to Pakistan.


6. The appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Baker and  was  allowed
   in a decision promulgated on 17 November 2015. The judge noted  that  the
   facts of the case were not disputed and the only issue was the  specified
   evidence. It was accepted that the  appellant  used  the  cash  from  her
   business to live on and did not deposit it into  her  bank  account.  The
   judge considered that the evidential flexibility provisions in  paragraph
   245AA(d)(iii) applied and that the further information provided on appeal
   would have allowed verification from the HMRC website as to the sponsor's
   earnings from self-employment, under paragraph 245(d)(iii)(2). The  judge
   considered that, whilst the appellant could not provide the required bank
   statements showing  earnings  from  self-employment,  the  decision-maker
   could  have  exercised  discretion  by  exceptionally  and  alternatively
   considering the other documents instead, namely the HMRC documents, which
   had  not  been  taken  into  account,  in   accordance   with   paragraph
   245AA(d)(iii)(1). The  judge  considered  that  the  ECM  ought  to  have
   exercised that discretion but failed to do so and she therefore exercised
   discretion herself and accepted, from the HMRC self-assessment  form  and
   tax calculations, that the sponsor's earnings were as  claimed  and  that
   sufficient evidence had been provided to satisfy the requirements of  the
   immigration rules. She allowed the appeal under the immigration rules.


7. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought by  the  respondent
   on  the  basis  that  the  judge  had  erred  by  relying  on   paragraph
   245AA(d)(iii) which applied only to applications made under  the  Points-
   Based System; that the judge had wrongly considered circumstances at  the
   date of decision rather than the evidence available at the  date  of  the
   application; and that the judge had erred by expecting the  ECO  to  make
   out the appellant's case for him.


8. Permission to appeal was granted on 3 May 2016.

Appeal hearing and submissions

9. At the hearing Mr Tufan referred to  Appendix  FM-SE  [D]  as  being  the
   correct evidential flexibility provision,  rather  than  paragraph  245AA
   which applied only to the Points-Based  System.  He  submitted  that  the
   judge had wrongly considered that she was  able  to  exercise  discretion
   under those provisions. If allowing the appeal, the correct course  would
   have been to refer the matter back to the ECO  rather  than  allowing  it
   outright. However the appellant's circumstances did  not  fall  with  the
   evidential flexibility provisions.

10. Mr Jafar submitted that  the  judge  was  able  to  exercise  discretion
   herself, as it was a discretion under the immigration  rules.  The  facts
   were not in dispute and it was therefore accepted that the sponsor  lived
   on the money earned from self-employment. The only issue  was  the  money
   not being paid into her account.  However  that  could  be  evidenced  by
   alternative means, namely through the HMRC  website.  The  appellant  had
   provided a valid reason for not  being  able  to  produce  the  specified
   document and therefore, pursuant to  Appendix  FM-SE  [D](e),  discretion
   could be exercised in the appellant's favour.


The relevant Immigration Rules


11. The immigration rules setting out the required  specified  evidence  are
   to be found in Appendix FM-SE, as follows:






    "7. In respect of self-employment in the UK as a partner, as a sole
    trader or in a franchise all of the following must be provided:
       (a) Evidence of the amount of tax payable, paid and unpaid for the
      last full financial year.
       (b) The following documents for the last full financial year, or for
       the last two such years (where those documents show the necessary
       level of gross income as an average of those two years):
         (i) annual self-assessment tax return to HMRC (a copy or print-
       out); and
         (ii) Statement of Account (SA300 or SA302).
       (c) Proof of registration with HMRC as self-employed if available.
       (d) Each partner's Unique Tax Reference Number (UTR) and/or the UTR
       of the partnership or business.
       (e) Where the person holds or held a separate business bank
       account(s), bank statements for the same 12-month period as the tax
       return(s).
       (f) personal bank statements for the same 12-month period as the tax
       return(s) showing that the income from self-employment has been paid
       into an account in the name of the person or in the name of the
       person and their partner jointly.
       (g) Evidence of ongoing self-employment through evidence of payment
       of Class 2 National Insurance contributions, or (where the person
       has reached state pension age) through alternative evidence (which
       may include, but is not confined to, evidence of ongoing payment of
       business rates, business-related insurance premiums, employer
       National Insurance contributions or franchise payments to the parent
       company).
       (h) One of the following documents must also be submitted:
             (i) (aa) If the business is required to produce annual audited
             accounts, such accounts for the last full financial year; or
             (bb) If the business is not required to produce annual audited
             accounts, unaudited accounts for the last full financial year
             and an accountant's certificate of confirmation, from an
             accountant who is a member of a UK Recognised Supervisory Body
             (as defined in the Companies Act 2006) or who is a member of
             the Institute of Financial Accountants;
         (ii) A certificate of VAT registration and the VAT return for the
         last full financial year (a copy or print-out) confirming the VAT
         registration number, if turnover is in excess of �79,000 or was in
         excess of the threshold which applied during the last full
         financial year;
         (iii) Evidence to show appropriate planning permission or local
         planning authority consent is held to operate the type/class of
         business at the trading address (where this is a local authority
         requirement); or
         (iv) A franchise agreement signed by both parties.
     (i) The document referred to in paragraph 7(h)(iv) must be provided if
     the organisation is a franchise."

12. The relevant evidential  flexibility  provisions  are  to  be  found  in
   Appendix FM-SE [D] as follows:

    D. (a) In deciding an application in relation  to  which  this  Appendix
    states that specified documents must be provided,  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer or Secretary  of  State  ("the  decision-maker")  will  consider
    documents that have been submitted with the application, and  will  only
    consider documents submitted after the application  where  sub-paragraph
    (b) or (e) applies.
    (b) If the applicant:
        (i) Has submitted:
              (aa) A sequence of documents and some of the documents in the
              sequence have been omitted (e.g. if one bank statement from a
              series is missing);
              (bb) A document in the wrong format (for example, if a letter
              is not on letterhead paper as specified); or
              (cc) A document that is a copy and not an original  document;
              or
             (dd) A document which does not contain all  of  the  specified
           information; or


         (ii) Has not submitted a specified document, the decision-maker may
         contact  the  applicant  or  his  representative  in   writing   or
         otherwise, and request the document(s) or the  correct  version(s).
         The material requested must be received at the address specified in
         the  request  within  a  reasonable  timescale  specified  in   the
         request....
    (e) Where the decision-maker is satisfied that there is a  valid  reason
    why a specified document(s) cannot be supplied, e.g. because it  is  not
    issued in a particular country or has been permanently lost, he  or  she
    may exercise discretion not to apply the requirement for the document(s)
    or to request alternative or additional information  or  document(s)  be
    submitted by the applicant."

Consideration and findings


13.  It seems to me that Judge Baker made several errors  in  her  decision.
   Clearly she erred in applying the  provisions  in  paragraph  245AA  when
   those apply only to applications  made  under  the  Points-Based  System.
   However given that  the  correct  provisions  in  Appendix  FM-SE[D]  are
   identical, I find nothing material in such an error.

14. More significant  is  her  decision  to  allow  the  appellant's  appeal
   outright under the immigration rules  on  the  basis  of  the  evidential
   flexibility provisions. I do not agree with Mr Jafar that it was open  to
   the judge herself to  exercise  discretion.  The  evidential  flexibility
   provisions, albeit now inserted into the immigration rules,  differ  from
   the other immigration rules conferring a discretion which may be reviewed
   by a judge. Appendix FM-SE[D](e) makes it clear that  the  discretion  is
   that of the decision-maker who is defined at Appendix FM-SE[D](a) as  the
   Entry Clearance Officer or the Secretary of State (in this case the Entry
   Clearance Officer). It was therefore not open to the  judge  to  exercise
   discretion herself. The  proper  course,  in  allowing  the  appeal,  was
   therefore to allow it to the limited extent that the decision was not  in
   accordance with the law and that the matter was to be  referred  back  to
   the ECO to exercise the required discretion.


15. However it seems to me that the judge  fundamentally  erred  in  finding
   that the evidential flexibility provisions applied in  the  first  place.
   The  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  are  strict  and  are   mandatory
   requirements. The appellant was required to provide the documents set out
   at Appendix FM-SE, section 7, which included  at  section  7(f)  personal
   bank statements for the same 12-month period as the tax  returns  showing
   that the income from self-employment has been paid into an account in the
   sponsor's name. Whilst the appellant provided  bank  statements  for  the
   sponsor, those bank  statements  did  not  show  the  income  from  self-
   employment as shown in her HMRC documents. Therefore a mandatory document
   was missing.


16. As the judge identified, the only evidential flexibility provision  that
   could potentially have been applicable was Appendix FM-SE[D](e)  as  that
   referred to a specified document not being  supplied.  However  for  that
   provision to apply, and for the  decision-maker  to  consider  exercising
   discretion, the decision-maker, namely the ECO, had to have been provided
   with a valid reason for the document not being supplied. The reason given
   to the judge, by way of a witness statement from the  sponsor,  was  that
   the sponsor used the cash from her self-employed earnings for her day-to-
   day living. However that reason was not given to the ECO,  or  indeed  to
   the ECM. No reason was given. I  do  not  see  how  it  can  possibly  be
   asserted that the ECO (or the ECM) was required to initiate an enquiry of
   his own volition, when it was clear from the rules what was required  and
   when the appellant had simply failed, without any reason, to supply  that
   mandatory evidence. That is the point made by the respondent in ground  3
   and I find merit in that ground.


17. Furthermore, it seems to me that the judge  also  erred  by  considering
   that Appendix FM-SE[D](e) permitted the consideration  of  the  sponsor's
   HMRC documents as an alternative document, when  that  was  in  itself  a
   mandatory piece of evidence required under Appendix FM-SE  section  7  in
   addition to the bank  statements.  The  judge  wrongly  referred  to  the
   respondent having failed to consider the HMRC  documents  when  that  was
   clearly not the case since the tax returns were specifically referred  to
   in the ECM Review. As the ECM said in the Review, the respondent  had  to
   see evidence of the declared earnings being received into  the  sponsor's
   bank account in order to be satisfied that the self-employment income was
   as claimed. There was therefore clearly a reason for the requirement,  in
   the rules, for bank statements to be produced to  demonstrate  an  income
   consistent with that shown in the tax returns for  the  same  period.  To
   consider that the respondent should permit such mandatory evidence to  be
   omitted was clearly to undermine the purpose of the rules and  the  judge
   plainly misunderstood or misinterpreted the provisions  in  Appendix  FM-
   SE[D](e).


18. Accordingly I find that material errors of law were made by  the  judge,
   in considering that it was open to her to exercise discretion  under  the
   evidential  flexibility  provisions  and  in   considering   that   those
   provisions were in any event applicable in the appellant's case. For  all
   of these reasons the judge's decision cannot stand and must be set  aside
   and re-made.


19. For the reasons already given, the appellant was  not  able  to  satisfy
   the specified evidence  requirements  in  Appendix  FM-SE  section  7  in
   relation to the sponsor's income from self-employment. That income  could
   not, therefore, be taken into account in considering the ability  of  the
   appellant to meet the income threshold as set out at paragraph  E-ECP.3.1
   of Appendix FM of  the  immigration  rules.  The  sponsor's  income  from
   employment in the NHS fell below the �18,600 threshold and the  appellant
   could not, therefore, meet  the  income  threshold  requirements  of  the
   rules. As already set out above, there was no basis for the  ECO  or  the
   ECM to consider exercising discretion under  the  evidential  flexibility
   provisions in Appendix FM-SE[D] and those provisions did not apply in the
   circumstances.  The  respondent's  decision  to  refuse  the  appellant's
   application under  the  immigration  rules  was  therefore  lawfully  and
   properly made.


20. Since Judge Baker allowed the appellant's appeal under  the  immigration
   rules, she did not go on to consider Article 8.  The  grounds  of  appeal
   before the First-tier Tribunal referred at [9] to Article 8, but only  in
   so far as it was claimed that the immigration rules had not been  applied
   fairly and it was stated in that paragraph that  the  appellant  did  not
   propose to rely on Article 8 other than in  respect  to  the  rules.  The
   appellant's Rule 24 response makes no submissions on  Article  8  and  no
   further evidence was produced before me in that respect. Whilst I did not
   specifically invite submissions on Article 8, there was no indication  by
   Mr Jafar that that was a  ground  being  pursued  independently.  In  any
   event, given that the relevant date of consideration is the date  of  the
   ECO's decision and that evidence relating to events  subsequent  to  that
   date is not relevant, and that it is open to  the  appellant  to  make  a
   fresh application with  the  required  specified  evidence  (the  sponsor
   ensuring that her earnings are  deposited  into  her  bank  account),  it
   cannot properly be argued, on the  evidence  available  at  the  relevant
   time, that the ECO's  decision  was  in  breach  of  the  appellant's  or
   sponsor's Article 8 human rights. The appellant simply  cannot  meet  the
   requirements of  the  immigration  rules  and  there  are  no  compelling
   circumstances justifying a grant of entry clearance outside the rules.

DECISION

21. The making of the decision  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
   making of an error on a point of law. The decision is set aside  and  the
   SSHD's appeal is  allowed.  I  re-make  the  decision  and  substitute  a
   decision dismissing Mr Ul Badar's appeal under the immigration rules  and
   on human rights grounds.
