Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Saeed (Solicitor Advocate)
For the Respondent:    Ms L Kenny (Counsel)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a determination by the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    (Judge J C Hamilton) promulgated  on  13  August  2014  dismissing  the
    appellant's appeal against the Secretary of  State's  decision  to  set
    removal directions, having refused him leave to  remain  on  the  basis
    that he had completed a period of 14 years' continuous residence.

 2. Although Mr Saeed, who represents the appellant before  us  today,  has
    formally adopted the other three grounds of appeal, the main focus  has
    been upon ground 1, which is that the determination of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is unsafe because it was  submitted  more  than  three  months
    after the  date  of  the  hearing  of  the  appeal.   In  fact  it  was
    promulgated three months and nine days after the hearing of the appeal.
    There is no evidence before  us  to  suggest  that  the  delay  in  its
    promulgation was due to any administrative error.

 3. Our attention has been drawn  by  Mr  Saeed  to  the  helpful  guidance
    relating to the three month rule in the case of Sambasivan v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [1999]  EWCA  Civ  04194.   That  case
    involved a somewhat longer delay than in the present case.  Potter  LJ,
    giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said this at [15]:

         "In cases of delay of this kind the matter is best approached  from
         the starting point  that  where  important  issues  of  credibility
         arise,  a  delay  of  over  three  months   between   hearing   and
         determination will merit remittance for rehearing unless by  reason
         of particular circumstances it is clear that the  eventual  outcome
         of the application, whether by the same or a different route,  must
         be the same."

 4. A little earlier in the judgment Potter LJ gave two  reasons  for  that
    approach.  First, he  said  that  any  substantial  delay  between  the
    hearing and preparation of the determination renders the assessment  of
    credibility issues unsafe.  Secondly, such a delay tends  to  undermine
    the  loser's  confidence  in  the  correctness  of  the  decision  once
    delivered.

 5. We have to bear in mind the guidance that has been given by  the  Court
    of Appeal, and the justification for it, and we  approach  this  appeal
    accordingly. Therefore the starting point is that  the  delay  of  over
    three months will merit remittance  for  rehearing  regardless  of  any
    other grounds, unless there is justification for  departing  from  that
    position because, by reason of  the  particular  circumstances  of  the
    case, it  is  clear  that  the  eventual  outcome  would  be  the  same
    irrespective of the delay.

 6. It is plain that in the  underlying  appeal,  the  credibility  of  the
    appellant and of his two witnesses was a matter of central  importance.
    In a determination  running  to  some  50  paragraphs,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal set out a very detailed account of the oral evidence given  by
    the appellant and by the two witnesses he  called  in  support  of  his
    appeal. The Tribunal has also  described  in  considerable  detail  the
    arguments that were put before  it  on  both  sides.   Essentially  the
    Tribunal found that the appellant  had  failed  to  establish,  on  the
    balance of probabilities, that he had in fact been in the  UK  for  the
    length of time that he claimed he had:

         "Looking at the evidence as a whole, even allowing for the  passage
         of time there was an enormous evidential gap in respect of the time
         that the appellant claimed to  have  been  living  in  Manchester."
         ([42])

 7. It had been the  appellant's  case  that  he  arrived  in  the  country
    illegally in around November 1997, and having met the two witnesses  in
    London, he then moved to Manchester where he commenced his studies.  He
    said that he was living either in Manchester or in Wigan in the  period
    from 1997 to 2004. He claimed that he had  embarked  upon  (and  indeed
    completed) four courses of study during that period. The  first  was  a
    language course, which he commenced on  1  January  1998.   The  second
    language course began sometime in 1998, and finished in February  1999.
    The third was a course that he is said to have started  in  around  May
    1999 and finished in November of that year, and the fourth an IT course
    which he claimed he began in January 2002.

 8. It was also his evidence that from around the summer  of  1998  he  was
    working part-time in a coffee shop near to the college  in  Manchester.
    He worked there for a period of about two years (although he  initially
    said in his evidence that that period was two months).

 9. There was no evidence adduced by the appellant from  anybody  who  knew
    him during the time that he claimed he was  living  in  Manchester  (or
    Wigan). He adduced no evidence from any friends he made  while  he  was
    there; no evidence from his tutors, or  from  fellow  students  or  co-
    workers; or from his employers.  He produced no payslips in relation to
    his job at the coffee shop, but he explained that by saying that he was
    paid cash in hand and that  he  did  not  ask  his  employers  to  give
    evidence because he considered that they would be  scared  and  refuse.
    The Tribunal interpreted that, fairly in our judgment, as meaning  that
    they would not want to admit that they had been employing him  off  the
    books.

10. The adverse credibility findings made by the Tribunal depended  upon  a
    mixture of inconsistencies and  inherent  implausibility.  One  of  the
    striking features of the case is that the Tribunal kept a  very  clear,
    detailed typed record of the evidence given at the hearing. There is  a
    note of the  questions  that  were  asked  not  only  by  the  parties'
    representatives, but also by the Tribunal itself  (differentiating  the
    latter by use of capital letters) and a note of the answers  that  were
    provided. A copy of that record  was  on  the  Tribunal  file,  and  we
    provided an opportunity at the hearing of this appeal  for  both  legal
    representatives to examine it and make submissions to us about it.

11. Despite Mr Saeed's attempts to persuade us otherwise, the determination
    is entirely consistent with that record and the evidence given  by  the
    appellant and his witnesses is accurately reflected in it.

12. A good example is paragraph  [39]  in  which  the  Tribunal  refers  to
    striking inconsistencies between the appellant's evidence and  that  of
    his witnesses that raised significant concerns about the reliability of
    the appellant's account.   It was the appellant's case that  whilst  he
    was in Manchester his brother (then in France) was sending  him  money.
    He said that it was �300 to �400 a month, and that the brother was  not
    sending the money every month but just when the appellant asked for it.
    When he was asked "How did he send the money?" he referred  to  one  of
    the witnesses, a Mr Aouti, going twice to Manchester and  bringing  him
    the money.  Otherwise the appellant said he went to London  to  collect
    it, every three months or so.

13. When Mr Aouti gave evidence, however, he said  he  had  never  been  to
    Manchester.  When he was asked if he ever gave money to the  appellant,
    he said sometimes he gave him �20 to �30 to help him out.  When he  was
    asked "Did you give money from someone else?" he initially said he  did
    not understand.  When the Tribunal explained  the  question:  "Did  you
    ever get money for him from someone else that you then  gave  to  him?"
    the answer was "no". All of this is recorded in the Tribunal's note and
    accurately reflected in the determination: paragraphs  [18]  and  [24]-
    [25].

14. Moreover, it is obvious that at the time  when  the  determination  was
    made, the First-tier Tribunal still had  a  clear  recollection  of  Mr
    Aouti's evidence, because paragraph [39] stated that  the  witness  was
    "clearly completely baffled" by the suggestion that he had been  giving
    the appellant money in  this  way.  The  Tribunal  drew  the  following
    conclusion:

    "I take into account that human memory is fragile, but this would  seem
    to be something that the witness could reasonably be expected  to  have
    remembered if it had happened."

    That  is  just  one  example  of  where  the  findings  made   in   the
    determination are consistent with the recorded evidence.  Although  not
    every piece of evidence is referred to in the determination, there  are
    no inconsistencies with the record and no crucial omissions.

15. One of the substantive grounds of appeal, besides the  delay,  is  that
    the First-tier Tribunal made no finding as to the  credibility  of  the
    appellant's witnesses and no findings at all regarding  their  evidence
    [Ground 3]. However, that complaint is unjustified. Paragraph  [41]  of
    the determination makes clear  adverse  findings  in  relation  to  the
    credibility of both the witnesses.  It states that  the  evidence  that
    they gave about the appellant's time in  Manchester  was  "very  vague"
    even though they both claimed to have been in  regular  and  reasonably
    frequent contact with him during this  time.   They  appeared  to  know
    nothing about  his life in Manchester despite being put forward as  his
    close friends who spoke to him frequently and who he visited regularly.
     They were unable to give any real detail about what he  was  doing  in
    Manchester, or how he was living whilst he was there.

16. The record of the hearing kept by the Tribunal supports those findings.
    It appears that neither of the two witnesses had any knowledge that the
    appellant was living in Wigan, as he claimed.  They also gave differing
    accounts of their contact with him whilst he was said to have  been  in
    Manchester. Mr Aouti said that he himself was  studying  and  therefore
    telephonic contact with the appellant was  only  every  three  or  four
    months or so.  When he was asked what  they  spoke  about,  he  replied
    "Mainly the trouble at home".  When the  other  witness,  Mr  Bouchamia
    (with whom there was allegedly more frequent telephone contact, once or
    twice a week) was asked what they were speaking about on the  telephone
    he said "How is he progressing, what he is studying".   He It was  then
    asked whether he knew what the appellant was studying  and  the  answer
    was "No". As the  Tribunal  found  in  paragraph  [41],  that  evidence
    seriously undermined the credibility  of  the  witness.   In  fact  the
    evidence of that witness that he never spoke  to  the  appellant  about
    where he was living, whether he was working or  what  he  was  studying
    during the whole of the period in which he was supposed  to  have  been
    studying in Manchester, was patently incredible as the Tribunal found.

17. In the light of what is stated in paragraph [41] of  the  determination
    it is clear to us that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  making  adverse
    findings in relation to the credibility  of  both  witnesses,  findings
    which were open to it on the evidence before it. Given that there  were
    specific adverse findings about their credibility in  relation  to  the
    claim to have known that the appellant was in Manchester  and  what  he
    was doing there, it can be inferred that their evidence in relation  to
    knowing him at when he alleged he first arrived in London  was  equally
    undermined.

18. However, the most important point is that the evidence of the appellant
    himself was found to be incredible. There are good reasons for that, in
    the light of the record kept by the Tribunal.  In paragraph [33] of the
    determination there is reference to the limited  evidence  produced  by
    the appellant supporting his claim to have been studying in Manchester.
     He produced evidence that  the  college  that  he  was  said  to  have
    enrolled exists, and a letter that was said  to  have  come  from  that
    college offering him a place  on  its  English  language  course.   The
    Tribunal made a comment that a photograph of the appellant was attached
    to that letter and it was not quite clear  why  the  college  would  do
    that.  There is also a comment about the fact that at the  end  of  the
    letter, next to the asterisk, appear the words "Fee settled" which  did
    not appear to relate to anything in the body of the letter.

19. However, it is clear that the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  jump  to
    adverse conclusions about the two features that it identified as  being
    odd. That document and the virtually identical certificates relating to
    the appellant's claimed studies between 1998 and 2003 were described by
    the  Tribunal  as  being  consistent  with  his  account,  but  equally
    consistent with an attempt to create the false impression that  he  was
    in Manchester between 1997 and  2003.  Paragraph  [33]  ends  with  the
    sentence "I therefore have to assess the reliability of these documents
    in the light of the evidence as a whole".

20. Ground 4 of the appellant's grounds of appeal sought to  castigate  the
    findings in paragraph [33] as "perverse", but there is nothing perverse
    about them.  The Tribunal has drawn attention to what it considered  to
    be some slightly odd  features  in  the  documents  relied  on  by  the
    appellant, but it has not come to a conclusion that by reason of  those
    features alone the documents are unreliable.  Instead the Tribunal  has
    taken the legitimate course of starting  from  the  position  that  the
    documents are neutral, and reserving any decision as to whether or  not
    the documents supported the appellant's claim until  it  has  evaluated
    his evidence and indeed all the other evidence adduced by him.

21. Whilst the inference can be drawn that at the  end  of  the  day  those
    documents were rejected as unreliable, the  Tribunal  was  entitled  to
    reach that conclusion in the light of the evidence as a whole. What was
    said about the documents  in  the  passage  complained  of  in  no  way
    amounted to a material error of law in the determination,  Neither  did
    the ultimate decision in paragraph  [42]  that  in  the  light  of  the
    "enormous evidential gap" the appellant had  failed  to  discharge  the
    burden upon him of proving that he had been in the UK at  the  time  he
    claimed to have been in  Manchester.  If  the  appellant  and  his  two
    supporting witnesses were not believed, as  they  were  not,  then  the
    documents relied could not outweigh their evidence so as to  mandate  a
    finding by the Tribunal that the  appellant  had  proved  that  he  was
    living in the UK for that  long  period  of  time  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities. On the contrary, the  Tribunal  had  found,  as  it  was
    entitled to, that the documents  were  consistent  with  the  appellant
    seeking to create a false impression of his  whereabouts  between  1997
    and 2003.

22. Taking  all  these  matters  into  consideration  and  looking  at  the
    determination as a whole, we are satisfied that although there has been
    an unfortunate delay leading to  the  determination  being  promulgated
    some nine days later than the latest date on which it should have  been
    in accordance with the normal rule, nevertheless, on application of the
    test set out in Sambasivan it is clear that the eventual outcome of the
    application would have been the same, and must be the same,  regardless
    of the delay. The appellant's version of events was unreliable for  all
    the reasons identified  by  the  Tribunal  in  the  determination,  and
    further  undermined  by  the  inconsistent  and  inherently  incredible
    evidence of his two witnesses, fatally for his appeal.

23. For that reason there is no substance in  ground  1.  We  have  already
    explained why grounds 3 and 4 have no merit.

24. The only ground remaining is Ground 2, which we  can  dispose  of  very
    shortly.  It was suggested that the First-tier  Tribunal  took  account
    irrelevant considerations in reaching its conclusions: the flaws in the
    evidence about the  appellant's  brother  sending  money  to  him  were
    submitted to be an irrelevant consideration, and likewise  the  failure
    of the witnesses to know what he was doing in Manchester.  However  the
    account given by the appellant of his brother sending him money and  by
    whom he was sending  it,  was  plainly  a  matter  of  some  importance
    relating to the credibility of the appellant and that  of  one  of  his
    witnesses; and if two people who  claimed  to  have  been  in  frequent
    contact with someone who was supposed  to  be  studying  in  Manchester
    nevertheless knew nothing about what he was doing there,  that  plainly
    calls into question the veracity of the whole of  the  their  evidence.
    Therefore the Tribunal, having formed the view that the  appellant  was
    not telling the truth about the money from his brother, was entitled to
    take that false account into consideration in assessing the credibility
    of his evidence as a whole and the same is  true  of  the  view  formed
    about the witnesses and their evidence corroborating his claim to  have
    been in Manchester at the relevant time.  There was no error of law  on
    this ground either.

25. In conclusion, we return to the two policy  considerations  behind  the
    general rule that a three  month  delay  will  render  a  determination
    unsafe.  The  first  relates  to  the  reliability  of  the  Tribunal's
    assessment of credibility. In the present case, where the assessment of
    credibility was plainly made on the basis  of  a  strong  and  accurate
    contemporaneous record of the evidence by a Tribunal that obviously had
    a clear recollection of it, and where demeanour appears to have  played
    very little part in the assessment, that concern is assuaged.  Moreover
    it is clear from an evaluation of the evidence that the  appellant  and
    his witnesses gave, as noted on the contemporaneous record, that  their
    accounts were contradictory and inherently unreliable, and any Tribunal
    would have reached the same conclusion.

26. The second concern is the public policy consideration that  such  delay
    tends to undermine the loser's confidence in  the  correctness  of  the
    decision once delivered.  However,  any  such  concern  can  easily  be
    assuaged in the present  case.  The  fact  that  the  determination  is
    entirely consistent with the detailed contemporaneous  notes  taken  by
    the Tribunal at the time of the hearing  makes  it  clear  to  us  that
    confidence can be placed in the correctness of the  decision  that  was
    delivered.

27. For those reasons we consider that the First-tier Tribunal did not make
    a material error of law on any of the grounds stated in the  Notice  of
    Appeal. Thus despite Mr Saeed's best efforts to persuade us  otherwise,
    we dismiss the appeal.
