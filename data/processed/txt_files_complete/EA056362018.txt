                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-Tier
        Tribunal Judge O'Garro promulgated on  28  June  2019  following  a
        hearing at Hatton Cross on 22 May 2019.






Background


     2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 14 February 1986  who
        appealed the respondent's decision refusing to  issue  her  with  a
        Residence Card in recognition of a right to reside  in  the  United
        Kingdom pursuant to Community Law.
     3. Permission to appeal was granted by another judge of the First-Tier
        Tribunal on 16 August 2019. On the same date notice of  hearing  at
        the Royal Courts of Justice on 14 October 2019 was  sent  by  first
        class post to both the appellant and  her  representatives,  London
        South Law Chambers.
     4. A representative of the Home Officers attended  but  there  was  no
        attendance on  the  appellant's  behalf,  no  explanation  for  the
        appellant's absence, or an application for  an  adjournment.  As  a
        result of lack of explanation  enquiries  were  undertaken  by  the
        Clerk to the Tribunal who, at 10:31, telephoned the  solicitors  on
        record for the appellant, London South Law Chambers,  on  0207  732
        9973, in order to find out why there was no appearance at court  by
        or on behalf of the appellant. The line went through to voice  mail
        and the Clerk left a detailed message which explained  the  problem
        and requested that he be contacted on his mobile telephone as  soon
        as possible.  Having  received  no  reply  from  London  South  Law
        Chambers the Clerk obtained  with  the  help  of  Field  House  two
        emergency mobile telephone numbers for the firm, 07956 207 159  and
        07943 350 840 which were given on their website. Unfortunately both
        of these mobile numbers failed to connect when rung  at  11:06  and
        11:07 respectively. At 11:07 the Clerk  made  a  further  telephone
        call to the landline number 0207 732 9973 and again  left  a  voice
        mail message but there was no response.
     5. In light of the situation it was concluded  it  was  in  accordance
        with the overriding objectives and principle of fairness to proceed
        with the hearing in the absence of the appellant.



Error of law


     6. Having considered the evidence, both oral  and  written,  Judge  O'
        Garro ('the Judge') found in the appellant's favour in relation  to
        the validity of the marriage conducted with her former husband,  Mr
        Maduro, in Nigeria. The Judge therefore found the appellant  was  a
        family member of an  EEA  national.  The  appellant  had  made  two
        previous applications when she had such status but by the time  she
        made her third application, on 30 April 2018, she was divorced from
        her EEA national spouse. The date of divorce is 28 March 2017.
     7.  The  Judge  initially  considered  whether   the   appellant   had
        established  a  right  of  permanent  residence  by   meeting   the
        qualifying  conditions  set  out  in  regulation  15  of  the   EEA
        Regulations. The Judge's findings on this issue are set out at  [34
        - 36] in the following terms:

             "34.     In the case before me the appellant married  her  EEA
                  former spouse on 14 July 2011 and they were divorced on 28
                  March  2017.  I  have  seen  the  HM  Revenue  &   Customs
                  employment history of Mr Maduro for tax  years  2012/2013,
                  2013/2014, 2014/2015, 2015/2016, 2016/2017. I am satisfied
                  that Mr Maduro was exercising  treaty  rights  from  April
                  2012 to April 2017 based on the evidence before me.


             35.      However to succeed under  regulation  15(1)  (b)  the
                  appellant must to  show  that  Mr  Maduro  was  exercising
                  treaty rights for a continuous period of five years during
                  their marriage. The appellant was married on 11 July  2011
                  and the marriage ended on 28 March 2017.


             36.  The evidence  before  me  shows  Mr  Maduro's  exercising
                  treaty rights from April 2012 to April 2017. According  to
                  my calculation, April 2012 to March 2017 would not show  5
                  continuous years of treaty rights. Unfortunately I have no
                  evidence before  me  regarding  Mr  Maduro's  exercise  of
                  treaty rights for tax year 2011/2012. I find that if  that
                  evidence was available, relying upon  the  Upper  Tribunal
                  decision in Idezuna, the appellant would have been able to
                  show 5 continuous years of exercise of Treaty rights by Mr
                  Maduro throughout the marriage and would have succeeded in
                  her appeal under Regulation 15(1) (b)."

     8. Having concluded  the  appellant  could  not  succeed  pursuant  to
        regulation  15  the  Judge   considered   whether   the   appellant
        established that she had acquired a  retained  right  of  residence
        pursuant to Regulation 10.  In doing so the Judge was  required  to
        consider whether the appellant was a self-sufficient person  as  it
        was not made out she qualified and any other basis. The Judge notes
        at [45] that following the breakup of her  marriage  the  appellant
        claimed she had been in receipt of financial support  to  meet  her
        living costs from friends and that she has been  a  self-sufficient
        person since her marriage ended in March 2017.  The  appellant  had
        provided a letter from a Mr Muraino  confirming  that  support  was
        being provided. The Judge found it necessary  to  consider  whether
        the applicant had the required comprehensive sickness insurance,  a
        mandatory  requirement  of   a   self-sufficient   person.   Having
        considered the evidence the Judge finds at [54]:

             "54.     With the limitations placed on when the appellant  is
                  able to use the insurance for medical conditions, I am not
                  satisfied that the insurance will cover the appellant  for
                  medical treatment in the majority of circumstances.  I  am
                  not satisfied that the appellant has provided satisfactory
                  evidence to satisfy me she is a self-sufficient person  as
                  defined under the EEA regulations."

     9. The appellant sought permission to appeal claiming the Judge failed
        to consider relevant evidence provided in  the  appellant's  bundle
        and ex-spouse's witness statement in which he claimed to have  been
        in employment since 2011.  The  grounds  also  asserted  the  Judge
        failed to consider the terms of the comprehensive health  insurance
        the appellant had acquired; failing to take into account  the  full
        and detailed insurance policy provided in the appellant's bundle.
    10. Permission to appeal was granted by another  judge  the  First-Tier
        Tribunal who concluded that the grounds are arguable.
    11. As noted above there was no attendance by the appellant.  The  copy
        health insurance policy provided in the bundle refers to the  exact
        terms of  an  individual's  entitlement  being  set  out  in  their
        membership statement.  This was not before the  Tribunal  and  does
        not appear to have been before the Judge. Accordingly  no  arguable
        legal error is  made  out  the  Judge's  concerns  based  upon  the
        evidence made available in relation to the health insurance.
    12. In relation to the Judge's concerns  relating  to  the  period  the
        appellant's former husband was exercising treaty rights, it is  not
        made out the Judge failed to consider all available evidence.  Some
        the pages in the bundle provided by the appellant to the Judge  are
        missing. Whilst there is a letter indicating the appellant's former
        husband was offered employment and 2011 there is no  evidence  from
        HMRC confirming any income being received from this source  at  the
        relevant time. There was nothing  before  the  Judge  to  establish
        lawful exercise of treaty rights by the  EEA  national  during  the
        missing year.
    13. The appellant fails to  establish  that  the  Judge's  decision  is
        outside the range of those reasonably available to the Judge on the
        evidence. Accordingly it is not established the Judge has erred  in
        law in a manner material to the  decision  to  dismiss  the  appeal
        sufficient to warrant the Upper Tribunal interfering any further in
        this decision.

Decision

    14. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.

   Anonymity.


    15. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008.
