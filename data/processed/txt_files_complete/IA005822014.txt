Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Echendu of the Minority Advice Bureau Leeds
For the Respondent:    Mr Dewison, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

     1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria, born on 26 July 1977.
     2. The Appellant was issued with entry clearance to the United Kingdom
        as a student on 10 September 2009. A grant of leave to  remain  was
        then made to him as a Tier 1 (Post Study  Work)  Migrant  until  31
        March 2013. On 8 March 2013 the  Appellant  applied  for  leave  to
        remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant.  That  application  was
        initially refused on 13 May 2013, but the decision was subsequently
        withdrawn and remade, so that it was refused again  on  4  December
        2013, and at the same time a decision was taken under  s47  of  the
        2006 Act to remove the Appellant from the United Kingdom.
     3. The Appellant appealed against those immigration decisions, and his
        appeal was heard by First Tier Tribunal Judge Cope on 5 March 2013,
        whereupon it was dismissed under  the  Immigration  Rules,  and  on
        Article 8 grounds in a Determination promulgated on20 March 2014.
     4. The Appellant sought permission from the  First  Tier  Tribunal  to
        appeal that decision. Permission was refused by First Tier Tribunal
        Judge Page on 29 April 2014. The application  was  renewed  to  the
        Upper Tribunal, whereupon permission was granted by Upper  Tribunal
        Judge Taylor on 27 May 2014. She considered  that  Judge  Cope  had
        arguably failed to make findings on the issues placed in dispute by
        the Respondent but  had  instead  embarked  upon  a  broad  ranging
        consideration of the meaning of "entrepreneur" and  "business",  so
        that  the  question   of   whether   the   Appellant's   commercial
        arrangements met the requirements of the Immigration Rules required
        further consideration.  Permission was however refused in  relation
        to the challenge to the Judge's disposal of the Article 8 appeal.
     5. The Respondent served a Rule 24 response to the grounds  of  appeal
        dated 3 July 2014 which simply asserted that the Judge was entitled
        to reach the conclusions that he did. Neither party has applied for
        permission to rely upon further evidence.
     6. Thus the matter comes before us.


   The Appellant's relationship with Epicanthus
     7. The Appellant studied for and was awarded a degree in  medicine  at
        the University of Ibadan in  Nigeria.  He  studied  for  a  Masters
        degree in Public Health at the University of Northumbria, which was
        awarded to him on 24 November 2010. He was registered  by  the  GMC
        with a licence to practise medicine in the UK from 14 June 2012.
     8. On 20 June 2012 the limited liability company Julifem Services  Ltd
        was incorporated ["Julifem"]. The  Appellant  is  and  was  at  all
        material times the sole shareholder and sole director of Julifem.
     9. On 28  December  2012  the  limited  liability  company  Epicanthus
        Services Ltd was incorporated ["Epicanthus"]. The Appellant is  and
        was at all material times the sole shareholder and sole director of
        Epicanthus (he assumed those roles on 4 January 2013). In addition,
        at the date of the application, the Appellant has accepted that  he
        was the sole employee of Epicanthus.
    10. A Companies House report on Epicanthus dated 7  March  2013  showed
        that no accounts for the company  had  yet  been  filed.  Unaudited
        accounts for Epicanthus for the  period  28  December  2012  to  31
        December 2013 prepared upon the Appellant's instructions,  and  the
        records he had kept for Epicanthus, recorded a turnover of �66,846,
        administrative expenses of �31,824, and thus a profit before tax of
        �35,022. The  post  tax  profit  was  largely  distributed  to  the
        Appellant as the sole shareholder by way of dividends  of  �25,000,
        with the balance held as retained profit. The notes to  the  profit
        and loss account disclose the Appellant's  salary  as  �7,500,  and
        reveal the administrative expenses to include not only the  use  of
        the Appellant's home as an office, but all those expenses  that  an
        employed man would meet from his post tax income.
    11. The Appellant was interviewed in relation to  his  application  for
        LTR on 13 November 2013. At that interview  he  accepted  that  his
        shareholding  and  directorship  of  Julifem  did  not   meet   the
        requirements of the Immigration Rules,  because  it  had  not  been
        acquired or incorporated  within  3  months  of  the  date  of  his
        application. Thus he stated that he intended to "close it down". He
        provided no information about the trading activities or accounts of
        Julifem, no information to suggest that it was actively trading  at
        the date of the application, and no  information  to  show  how  he
        intended that its affairs should be wound up.
    12. In relation to Epicanthus the Appellant accepted at that  interview
        that he had prepared no business plan. He  accepted  (and  provided
        some sample contracts to confirm) that from time to time Epicanthus
        entered into contracts with ID Medical Group Ltd  ["IDMG"]  whereby
        Epicanthus agreed to provide the services of the Appellant to  IDMG
        at a rate of �40 per hour. In turn IDMG agreed from  time  to  time
        with  NHS  Hospital  Trusts  in  the  North  East  to  provide  the
        Appellant's services as a qualified doctor, which in practice meant
        that he was performing  locum  work  on  the  night  shift  in  the
        Accident  and  Emergency  Departments  of  those   hospitals.   The
        Appellant accepted at  interview  that  Epicanthus  had  only  ever
        entered into such contracts with IDMG.
    13. Accordingly at the  date  of  the  application  the  only  business
        undertaken by Epicanthus was to provide to IDMG at the hourly  rate
        of �40/hour the services of the Appellant as a hospital  locum,  at
        the locations, and for the hours, required by IDMG.  The  Appellant
        has never asserted, and  the  evidence  provided  by  him  did  not
        suggest, that the NHS Hospital Trusts that  sought  to  engage  his
        services insisted upon these commercial arrangements.
    14. Thus the Respondent took the point when  refusing  the  application
        that the evidence showed that the Appellant  was  simply  operating
        Epicanthus as a vehicle to provide the services of  himself  as  an
        employee of that company, to an agency full time, who would in turn
        from time to time provide his services as a doctor to  a  hospital.
        As  a  consequence  the  Respondent  was  not  satisfied  that  the
        Appellant had  any  genuine  intention  to  invest  in  Epicanthus,
        because there was simply no necessity for Epicanthus to  advertise,
        to recruit staff, or to  take  on  office  premises.  Moreover  the
        Respondent was not satisfied that the  Appellant  had  any  genuine
        intention to grow or expand the business of Epicanthus.
    15.  Moreover  the  Respondent  was  satisfied  that   the   commercial
        arrangement between Epicanthus and IDMG meant that one  was  simply
        supplying a member of staff  to  another;  the  Appellant  was  not
        providing medical services to IDMG,  but  only  to  a  third  party
        customer of IDMG. Thus the  Respondent  concluded  that  given  the
        Appellant's evidence about Julifem, he had only  ever  incorporated
        Epicanthus in order to seek to meet the requirements of the PBS for
        LTR as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.


   The availability of �50,000 to the Appellant, and his intention to invest
   in Epicanthus
    16. In support of his application the Appellant sought  to  demonstrate
        that he met the  requirements  of  paragraph  (d)  of  Table  4  to
        Appendix A of the Immigration Rules by providing evidence  that  he
        had available to him the sum of �50,000. The evidence  provided  to
        do so consisted of bank statements for a Lloyds  TSB  bank  account
        that he had caused Epicanthus to open on  5  February  2013.  These
        statements covered the period 5 February 2013 - 1  May  2013.  They
        recorded a credit to the account of �50,000 on  12  February  2013,
        and the withdrawal of that same sum from the account ten days later
        on 22 February 2013.
    17. It has never been suggested that  Epicanthus  had  the  benefit  of
        these funds on any other occasion,  and  the  Appellant  has  never
        suggested that the advance of these funds to Epicanthus was by  way
        of share capital. To the extent that it  should  be  inferred  that
        this movement of funds constituted a short term loan to  Epicanthus
        (and the Appellant has never suggested that this was the case) then
        the terms of the loan were never reduced to writing.
    18. In support of his application the Appellant  had  also  provided  a
        bank statement for a Lloyds TSB Easy Saver  bank  account  that  he
        held in his own name and which covered the period 10 September 2012
        - 5 March 2013. This  bank  statement  recorded  a  credit  to  the
        account of �23,000 on 9 January 2013, of �5,000 on 4 February 2013,
        of �17,000 on 5 February 2013, and of �5,000 on  8  February  2013.
        (Each of those credits to the account is recorded as being  by  way
        of a transfer from another account held by the Appellant  with  the
        same branch of the same  Bank.  No  details  of  that  source  bank
        account have however ever been disclosed, and there is  no  obvious
        reason for the Appellant to have arranged his financial affairs  in
        this way.) The statement for the Easy  Saver  account  records  the
        withdrawal of �50,000 on 12 February 2013, and the deposit of  that
        same sum ten days later on 22 February 2013; it is plain that  this
        is the same sum of money that was  transferred  to  the  Epicanthus
        bank account for that same ten day period.
    19. The Appellant was questioned about the funds available  to  him  at
        interview. He said that the �50,000 was in part  his  own  savings,
        and as to about �37,000 funds provided to him  by  members  of  his
        family. Whilst he asserted that this money could be regarded as his
        inheritance, he also accepted that he would repay it if asked to do
        so by the family members who had provided these funds to him.
    20. The Respondent took the point when refusing  the  application  that
        the evidence submitted  in  support  of  the  application  did  not
        disclose the ultimate source of  the  funds  that  constituted  the
        �50,000, and  that  although  an  explanation  had  been  given  at
        interview (which was not corroborated  by  any  documentation)  the
        Appellant had appeared to accept that he might be required  by  his
        family to repay to them some  �37,000  of  those  funds.  Thus  the
        Respondent was not satisfied that all of this money  was  genuinely
        available to him to invest in Epicanthus.
    21. In addition  the  Respondent  took  the  point  that  she  was  not
        satisfied that the Appellant genuinely intended at the date of  the
        application  to  invest  the  �50,000,  or  any  part  of  it,   in
        Epicanthus. The Appellant had accepted at  interview  that  he  had
        invested none of that sum in the business, and although he asserted
        that he would use it to "get  my  own  place,  employ  staff",  the
        nature of Epicanthus' business (which was simply to provide  a  tax
        efficient vehicle for the supply of his services to a locum agency)
        was such that the Respondent did not believe that  such  investment
        was needed, or that the Appellant had a genuine intention  to  make
        it.


   Error of Law?
    22. We approach this appeal on the basis that HMRC have not raised  any
        issue over the Appellant's tax affairs, and that  the  decision  to
        provide his services through the  medium  of  Epicanthus,  so  that
        expenses can be set against tax in a way that is  not  open  to  an
        employee, and so that fees paid in relation  to  the  work  he  has
        performed can be received by him in large part by way of dividends,
        rather than being subject to PAYE and NIC, is  not  one  that  HMRC
        have sought to challenge.
    23. We regret to have  to  record  that  we  experienced  very  serious
        difficulties in  understanding  Mr  Echendu's  somewhat  incoherent
        submissions,  and  in  persuading  him  to  address  the   relevant
        requirements of the Immigration Rules, and  the  issues  raised  by
        this appeal. Mr Echendu's approach  to  the  presentation  of  this
        appeal was not assisted by his refusal to address the  requirements
        of paragraph 245DD(h), (i), and (k), his failure to use the version
        of the Immigration Rules in force at the date of the application in
        preparing for the appeal, or  his  misguided  insistence  that  the
        changes to the Immigration Rules that were introduced by HC943 were
        not made before the Appellant had submitted his application for LTR
        on 8 March 2013.
    24. We are however satisfied that the changes made to  the  Immigration
        Rules by HC943 took effect on 31 January 2013. Thus the application
        made by the Appellant on 8 March 2013 was quite properly considered
        by the Respondent by reference to sub-paragraphs  245DD  (h),  (i),
        and (k), which (inter alia)  were  introduced  to  the  Immigration
        Rules by paragraph 2 of the statement of changes  effective  on  31
        January 2013.
    25. As we understand it, the challenge  that  the  Appellant  seeks  to
        advance to Judge Cope's decision is that he failed to make adequate
        findings of fact, and that the conclusions that he reached were not
        open to him. Put simply we are not satisfied that these  challenges
        are made out. It  is  quite  plain  from  a  fair  reading  of  the
        Determination as a whole that the Judge made no mistake of fact  in
        his analysis  of  the  nature  of  the  relationships  between  the
        Appellant and Epicanthus, or in  his  analysis  of  the  commercial
        arrangements the Appellant had caused Epicanthus to enter into with
        IDMG. The Judge noted that Epicanthus did not retain  anyone,  save
        for the Appellant at the date of the application, and thus  it  had
        not placed anyone other than the Appellant with  any  third  party,
        and when it had done so, it had only ever  done  so  with  the  one
        locum agency IDMG. Moreover the  Judge  correctly  identified  that
        Epicanthus had never made  any  effort  to  do  anything  else.  He
        concluded that the Appellant was not pursuing  a  genuine  business
        enterprise through Epicanthus, but was simply using  Epicanthus  to
        avoid the restrictions that prevented him taking direct  employment
        as a doctor, because he had not sought or obtained LTR as a Tier  2
        Migrant. In our judgement that conclusion was  one  that  was  well
        open to him on the evidence, and there  was  no  lack  of  adequate
        reasoning for it. Thus there was no error of law in his decision to
        dismiss the appeal.
    26. To the extent that it can properly be argued that the Judge  should
        have gone further, and that he should have dealt individually  with
        each the issues  placed  in  dispute  by  the  Respondent,  we  are
        satisfied that the Appellant can  derive  no  assistance  from  the
        argument, because it was inevitable  that  those  issues  would  be
        resolved adversely to him.
    27. In our judgement the commercial reality of  the  arrangements  that
        have been made by the Appellant are quite clear,  and  his  actions
        entirely fail to offer any support for the proposition that he held
        at any material time a  genuine  intention  to  invest  �50,000  in
        Epicanthus [paragraph 245DD (h)(ii)], even if it was possible  that
        a Judge would  conclude  on  the  evidence  that  such  a  sum  was
        genuinely available  to  him.  The  Appellant  never  prepared,  or
        disclosed, any business plan to demonstrate when, or how, he  would
        make such an investment in Epicanthus, or what  it  would  be  used
        for, or what commercial benefit  he  anticipated  Epicanthus  would
        gain  from  it.  It  is  perfectly  plain  that  Epicanthus  traded
        profitably at the date of the application without  the  benefit  of
        any such investment, and that to continue the business of providing
        the Appellant's services to IDMG, no investment was required.
    28. Mr Echendu's argument  that  the  payment  of  tax  by  either  the
        Appellant or Epicanthus constitutes "investment" in Epicanthus  has
        no proper foundation, and is quite simply wrong.
    29. Although at interview the Appellant had  asserted  that  Epicanthus
        would take on commercial premises there was patently no  commercial
        need  for  it  to  do  so.  Moreover  the  Appellant  as  its  sole
        shareholder had derived a  significant  commercial  advantage  from
        Epicanthus choosing not to do so, because he had  set  against  the
        taxable profits of the company its use of part of his home, thereby
        maximising the post tax profit of the company,  and  thus  the  sum
        that could properly be declared as dividends, to his benefit as the
        sole shareholder.
    30.  Again,  although  the  Appellant  had  asserted  at  interview  an
        intention that Epicanthus should grow in the  future  by  retaining
        other doctors who were willing to  undertake  locum  work,  he  had
        taken no steps to recruit them, or to explore how Epicanthus  could
        do so profitably. In our judgement it is extremely difficult to see
        how such an intention could ever have been genuinely held  by  him.
        The Appellant failed  to  offer  any  evidence  to  show  that  any
        suitably qualified doctor would be prepared to work for  Epicanthus
        for less than they could earn by contracting either with  IDMG,  or
        another locum agency directly, or by setting up their  own  company
        through which to supply their services to a  locum  agency.  Unless
        the Appellant could demonstrate that  Epicanthus  could  achieve  a
        profit on the hourly rate paid by IDMG  for  such  a  doctor,  then
        there would be no commercial purpose in Epicanthus retaining such a
        doctor.
    31. The grounds of appeal to the  Appellant's  IAFT-1  asserted  baldly
        that the decisions under appeal breached his  "Convention  rights".
        To the extent that this was properly to be read as a reliance  upon
        the Appellant's Article 8 rights,  as the Judge did, then there was
        no grant of permission to appeal in relation to  his  dismissal  of
        that aspect of the appeal. In any event we are satisfied that there
        was no error of law in the dismissal of that aspect of the  appeal;
        it is not suggested that any material evidence  was  overlooked  by
        the Judge, or that he failed to apply the  relevant  jurisprudence.
        In our judgement the arguments  advanced  in  the  application  for
        permission to appeal are no  more  than  a  disagreement  with  his
        assessment of the proportionality of  the  decisions  under  appeal
        dressed up as assertions of errors of law.




   DECISION


      The Determination of the First Tier Tribunal which was promulgated  on
      30 March 2014 did not involve the making of an error  of  law  in  the
      decision to dismiss the appeal that requires that decision to  be  set
      aside and remade. The decision to dismiss the  appeal  is  accordingly
      confirmed.




Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge JM Holmes

Dated 7 August 2014
