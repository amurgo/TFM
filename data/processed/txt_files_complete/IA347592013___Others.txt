For the Respondents/ Claimants: Mr S Karim, Counsel instructed by Khans
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the claimants' appeals against  the
    decision  by  the  Secretary  of  State  to  refuse   to   grant   them
    discretionary leave to remain outside the Rules on Article  8  grounds,
    and against her concomitant  decision  to  make  directions  for  their
    removal pursuant to  Section  47  of  the  2006  Act.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do  not  consider
    that it is necessary for the claimants  to  be  accorded  anonymity  in
    these proceedings before the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The claimants are all nationals of Pakistan.   The  first  claimant  is
    married to the second claimant, and the third and fourth claimants  are
    their two children.  The third claimant N I was born in the  UK  on  28
    May 2011, and the fourth claimant J I was born in Pakistan  on  29  May
    2007.  As the  first  claimant  is  the  principal  claimant  in  these
    appeals, I shall hereafter refer to him simply as  the  claimant,  save
    where the context otherwise requires.

 3. The claimant first entered the UK on 17 February  2004  with  leave  to
    enter as a student.  The claimant successfully extended his stay in the
    United Kingdom as a student on a number of occasions, culminating in  a
    last grant of leave to remain in the UK as a  Tier  4  Student  Migrant
    which was valid until 28 June 2013.  One of his earlier extensions  for
    stay was under the International Graduate Scheme (until 20  May  2009).
    His wife and eldest child J I joined  him  in  the  United  Kingdom  as
    dependants on 24 November 2007.

 4. On 24 June 2013 the  claimant  applied  for  further  leave  to  remain
    outside  the  Rules  on  compassionate  grounds,  with  the   remaining
    claimants as his dependants.  In a covering letter, his solicitors said
    that the claimant had been in gainful employment as a postman  for  the
    Royal Mail in order to subsidise himself and to avoid being a burden on
    society.  He had been working in accordance of the terms of his student
    visa, but if granted leave to remain the Royal Mail was in  a  position
    to offer him permanent full-time employment.  He had nothing to  return
    to in Pakistan.  He had no home, no business, and no social connections
    there.  J I was over 6 years of age, and attending primary school.   He
    was currently in year 2 and was achieving pleasing progress.

 5. On 10 August 2013 the Secretary of State gave her reasons for  refusing
    the application.  The claimant did not qualify under the partner route,
    as his partner was not a British  citizen,  nor  was  she  present  and
    settled in the UK; nor was she in the UK with refugee  leave  or  as  a
    person with humanitarian protection.  He also did not qualify under the
    parent route, as his children were not British citizens, they were  not
    settled in the UK, and neither of them had lived in the UK for at least
    seven years preceding the date  of  his  application.   Whilst  it  was
    acknowledged he had a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with
    his children, his application fell for refusal  under  the  eligibility
    requirements of the Rules.  As he had failed to meet those  eligibility
    requirements, he could not benefit from the criteria set out  in  EX.1.
    Having spent 26 years in his home country, and in the  absence  of  any
    evidence to the contrary, it was not accepted that  in  the  period  of
    time he had been in the UK he had lost ties to his home country, and so
    he did not meet the requirements of Rule 276ADE(vi).

 6. The Secretary of State gave  separate  consideration  to  each  of  the
    remaining claimants, and refused their applications in  line  with  the
    refusal of the claimant's application.

 7. The accompanying notices of immigration decision contained  a  One-Stop
    Warning which stated inter alia that, if at a later  date  the  reasons
    why they thought they  should  be  allowed  to  stay  in  this  country
    changed, or new reasons arose, they must tell the Home Office  as  soon
    as possible.  The ongoing requirement to state their reasons as to  why
    they should be allowed to stay in the country was  made  under  Section
    120 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 8. The claimants' appeals were originally scheduled to be heard in January
    2014, but the appeals were adjourned because of the claimant's illness.
     This was also the reason why the hearing scheduled for  the  beginning
    of February 2015 was adjourned.  The appeals were relisted for  hearing
    in May 2014.  By that time the claimant's new solicitors had  served  a
    Statement of Additional Grounds relying on the fact that  the  claimant
    had now accrued over ten years' continuous lawful residence in the  UK,
    as  he  had  enjoyed  3C  leave  since  making  the   application   for
    discretionary leave to remain, which he made before the expiry  of  his
    last period of student leave.  Judge Scott-Baker adjourned the  hearing
    to give the Secretary of State the opportunity  to  consider  this  new
    ground of appeal.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 9. The claimants' appeals eventually came before Judge  Beach  sitting  at
    Taylor House on 8 October  2014.   Both  parties  were  represented  by
    Counsel.  In her subsequent decision, Judge Beach  found  at  paragraph
    [24] that the claimant had shown that he had remained lawfully  in  the
    UK for over ten years.  He therefore fulfilled the requirements of  the
    Rules.

10. The judge observed at paragraph [25] that the remaining claimants could
    not meet the requirements of the long residency  Rules,  and  that  the
    long residency Rules do not allow for dependants to  be  considered  as
    part of the application.  But they  had  a  family  connection  to  the
    claimant.  In the circumstances she held there were compelling  reasons
    why consideration should be given as to whether the  second  to  fourth
    claimants should be granted leave to remain  outside  the  Rules.   The
    judge set out the five point Razgar test, and found at  paragraph  [28]
    that the claimant could not return to Pakistan with  the  rest  of  his
    family.  Later, at paragraph [32] the judge found the second to  fourth
    claimants would be returning  to  a  country  to  which  they  had  not
    returned on a regular or frequent  basis.   There  was  a  family  home
    there, and so they would have a home to which they could return.   They
    also spoke some Urdu, and so they would  not  have  language  problems.
    But, the second to fourth claimants  would  be  returning  to  Pakistan
    without the first claimant, and it would not be  reasonable  to  expect
    them to be separated, given  that  the  first  claimant  fulfilled  the
    requirements of the Rules regarding long residency.

11.  At  paragraph  39  she  said  that,  taking  into  account   all   the
    circumstances and relevant case  law  including  Gulshan  and  Shahzad,
    there were compelling reasons why the second to fourth claimants should
    be granted leave outside the Rules.  She proceeded to allow  the  first
    claimant's appeal under the Rules, and the  appeals  of  the  remaining
    claimants on human rights grounds outside the Rules.

The Grant of Permission

12. On 22 December 2014 Judge Pooler granted permission to appeal  for  the
    following reasons:

         It is arguable that the judge failed to give  reasons  for  finding
         that the successful claimant would not return to Pakistan with  his
         wife and children and  failed  to  consider  whether  it  would  be
         reasonable for him to choose to remain in  the  UK.   She  arguably
         failed to consider the principles considered  in  Azimi-Moayed  and
         Others ("decisions affecting children" onward appeals) [2013]  UKUT
         00197 (IAC).

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

13. At the hearing before me, Mr Karim, who did not appear below, mounted a
    stout defence of the judge's decision.  But having  listened  carefully
    to the submissions of both representatives,  I  was  persuaded  that  a
    material error of law was made out.  I gave my reasons for  so  finding
    in short form, and my extended reasons are set out below.

14. For the purposes of remaking the decision,  I  received  oral  evidence
    from the claimant  on  the  topic  of  returning  with  his  family  to
    Pakistan.

15. Mr Karim submitted that the claimant's case  was  strengthened  by  two
    developments since the  date  of  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  The first was that the claimant's eldest son had now accrued
    over seven years' residence in the United Kingdom, and the  second  was
    that, in the light  of  the  unchallenged  finding  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that the claimant qualified for ILR under paragraph 276B,  the
    claimant's younger son  could  apply  for  registration  as  a  British
    national.  These factors combined  to  tip  the  scales  in  the  wider
    proportionality  assessment  decisively  in  favour  of  none  of   the
    claimants being required to leave the United Kingdom.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

16. There was no challenge by the Secretary of  State  to  the  finding  of
    Judge Beach that the claimant qualified for ILR on the grounds that  he
    had accrued ten years' lawful residence.  But she was wrong  to  plunge
    into a freewheeling Article 8 assessment without first considering  the
    position of the remaining family members under Appendix FM.

17. When the Secretary of State considered the position under Appendix  FM,
    the criteria in EX.1 did not fall for consideration as the claimant did
    not meet the eligibility requirements.  In the  light  of  the  judge's
    finding that the claimant now qualified for ILR, the claimant now  also
    satisfied the eligibility requirements for his case and  those  of  his
    dependants to be considered under EX.1.  In short,  the  central  issue
    now became whether there were insurmountable obstacles to the  claimant
    carrying on family life with his wife in Pakistan.

18. The judge needed to address this question as a necessary  precursor  to
    an evaluation of whether,  assuming  the  answer  was  no  (as  on  the
    evidence it plainly was),  to  an  evaluation  of  whether  there  were
    compelling circumstances "not sufficiently recognised" by  Appendix  FM
    such as to justify a grant of leave to remain outside the Rules.

19. The upshot of the judge bypassing the two stage  approach  required  by
    the Nagre/Gulshan line of authority was that her approach to assessment
    of the claim outside the Rules was fatally flawed.   Most  egregiously,
    in her assessment of whether  it  was  reasonable  for  the  claimant's
    dependants to return to Pakistan, she failed  to  direct  herself  that
    there were not insurmountable obstacles to the  return  of  the  entire
    family.

20. In addition, there was a separate error on the part  of  the  judge  in
    failing to give adequate reasons as  to  why  the  claimant  would  not
    return to Pakistan with his dependants; and,  if  this  was  the  case,
    whether that was a reasonable position for the claimant to adopt in all
    the circumstances.

21. The claimant's witness statement  at  the  hearing  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal contained nothing about  any  difficulties  which  the  family
    would encounter on return to Pakistan, nor did it contain a declaration
    by the claimant that he would not return to Pakistan with the  rest  of
    his family.  Her  manuscript  Record  of  Proceedings  shows  that  the
    claimant was cross-examined about the  difficulties  which  the  family
    might face on return.  He is not recorded as saying that he  would  not
    return with his family.

22. But even if he had given such evidence, the judge would have been wrong
    to treat his declared position as being decisive.  Going back to  first
    principles, Article 8 does not confer on a married couple the right  to
    choose where they live. It was a matter  of  choice  for  the  claimant
    whether he gave priority to enjoying family life with his dependants in
    Pakistan or to taking advantage of the fact that he  was  now  able  to
    secure his own status in the United Kingdom.

23. Accordingly, for the reasons given above, the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal contained an error of law, such that  it  should  be  set
    aside and remade.

The Remaking of the Decision

24. In his oral evidence before me, the claimant said he was not willing to
    go back to Pakistan as there were more opportunities here.   In  cross-
    examination, he was asked what  prevented  him  from  going  back.   He
    answered that he had a good job here and it was a good  environment  in
    which to bring up his children.  He knew that he could raise  his  kids
    better here than in Pakistan.  It was put to him that he  had  come  to
    the United Kingdom to  gain  qualifications  which  would  enhance  his
    employability in Pakistan.  The claimant agreed, but  said  the  market
    was totally different now.   He  knew  a  lot  of  graduates  who  were
    struggling to obtain jobs in their native country.  Mr Avery asked  him
    whether he had tried to look for a job in Pakistan, and he said no.

25. In answer to questions for clarification purposes from me, the claimant
    said he was currently working as a postman for the  Royal  Mail  at  an
    annual salary of �24,000.  But this figure did not include overtime.

26. The evidence which I received from the claimant  does  not  change  the
    landscape with regard to whether  the  criteria  in  EX.1(a)  are  met.
    Having regard to the definition of insurmountable  obstacles  contained
    in EX.2, I consider that the evidence falls well short of  establishing
    that there are insurmountable obstacles to the claimant enjoying family
    life with his wife (and children) in Pakistan.

27. However, there are compelling reasons not sufficiently recognised under
    the Rules for the second to fourth claimants to be  granted  Article  8
    relief in respect of their impending removal. Firstly, J  I  is  now  a
    qualifying child under Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act.  The definition
    of a qualifying child under the statute does not include a  requirement
    that the child in question should have accrued seven years at the  date
    of application.  It is simply enough that the child has  accrued  seven
    years' residence at the date  of  assessment.   So  on  a  freestanding
    proportionality  assessment  outside  the  Rules,  the  claims  of  the
    dependants are much stronger than they have been hitherto.  It  is  not
    disputed that J I's  mother  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with J I, and the burden of establishing that  it  is  not
    reasonable to expect J I to leave the United Kingdom is not as  onerous
    as proving that  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  family
    returning as a unit to Pakistan.

28.  Another  and  more  important  consideration  in  the  proportionality
    assessment is the application of Chikwamba principles.  The claimant is
    now eligible to support an application by his dependants for  leave  to
    remain under the Rules, relying on the  fact  that  they  are  able  to
    demonstrate compliance with the financial requirements.   The  required
    financial threshold for a spouse and two children is an  annual  income
    of �24,800. On the basis of the claimant's oral evidence it  is  likely
    that his annual salary reaches this threshold, when overtime  is  taken
    into account.

29. If the claimant or his wife had a poor immigration history, it might be
    reasonable to require the dependants to return to Pakistan in order  to
    apply for entry clearance.  But neither the claimant nor his  wife  has
    an adverse immigration history, and requiring the dependants to go back
    to Pakistan  to  apply  for  entry  clearance  would  be  unnecessarily
    disruptive, and would be plainly contrary to the best interests of J I.

30. For the above reasons, I reach the  conclusion  that  the  interference
    consequential  upon  the  removal  of  the  second,  third  and  fourth
    claimants is disproportionate to the legitimate public end sought to be
    achieved, namely the maintenance  of  firm  and  effective  immigration
    controls.

Notice of Decision

The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the  first  claimant's
appeal under the Rules did not contain an  error  of  law,  and  accordingly
that decision stands.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing  the
appeals of the second to fourth claimants on Article 8 grounds  outside  the
Rules contained an error of law, and accordingly the following  decision  is
substituted: the appeals of the second to fourth claimants  against  removal
are allowed on Article 8 grounds outside the Rules.
