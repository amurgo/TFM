Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms R Dulay, Counsel


                    DECISION AND REASONS ON ERROR OF LAW


   1. The appellant  is  the  Secretary  of  State,  who  appeals  with  the
      permission of the First-tier Tribunal, against a decision of Judge  of
      the First-tier Tribunal Callender Smith who, in a decision promulgated
      on 20 December 2016, allowed the  appeal  of  Mr  Norman  against  the
      Secretary of State's decision, dated 4 April 2016, to refuse his human
      rights claim, founded on article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.  Mr
      Norman had made representations to the Secretary of State in  response
      to being notified that the Secretary of State had decided  to  make  a
      deportation order against him because  his  presence  in  the  UK  was
      deemed not to be conducive to the public good.


   2. It is more convenient to refer to the parties as they were before  the
      First-tier Tribunal. From now on we shall refer to Mr Norman  as  "the
      appellant" and the Secretary of State as "the respondent".

   3. We were not asked to make an anonymity direction and we saw no  reason
      to make one.

   4. The salient background facts  are  as  follows.  The  appellant  is  a
      citizen of Ghana, born on 18 January 1980 or 18  January  1981[1].  He
      came to the UK on 10 September 1996 in order to join  his  mother  for
      settlement. He was granted indefinite leave to enter on arrival. On 22
      June 2004 his passport was endorsed on application  with  a  residence
      permit stating he held indefinite leave to remain. On 22  August  2009
      his first daughter was born to a former partner. On 23  July  2011  he
      married a British citizen. On 8 October 2012 his second  daughter  was
      born to his spouse.

   5. The circumstances behind the current decision are highly  unusual.  On
      15 September 2000 the appellant was  convicted  of  conspiracy/robbery
      and sentenced  to  five  years'  imprisonment  in  a  young  offenders
      institution. On 28 November 2005 he was convicted of failing to notify
      a change of circumstances to the local authority which was paying  him
      housing benefit and sentenced to a  community  punishment  order.  For
      reasons which are unknown, the appellant's offending did not cause the
      respondent to initiate deportation proceedings until much later. On  7
      November 2014 the Home Office received an application for  a  no  time
      limit stamp to be placed in the passport  of  a  person  with  similar
      details to the appellant. In response to this  application  background
      checks  were  conducted  which  brought  to  light   the   appellant's
      convictions. A decision to make a deportation  order  was  issued  and
      sent to the appellant's  last  known  address.  Solicitors  acting  on
      behalf of the other Mr Norman wrote to the Home  Office  denying  that
      their  client  had  any  convictions.  While  this  matter  was  under
      investigation, the appellant travelled to  Ghana.  On  his  return  to
      Heathrow on 14 September 2015 the appellant was detained. He clarified
      that he had not had any contact with the Home Office since making  his
      no time limit application  in  2004  but  he  confirmed  he  had  been
      convicted of robbery in 2009. It was established  that  the  appellant
      had not made the no time limit application in 2014 and he was released
      on 22 September 2015 but only after being served with  a  decision  to
      make a deportation order.


   6. In the notice of decision, the respondent applied paragraph 398(a)  of
      the Immigration Rules, HC395, in order to assess  whether  there  were
      very compelling  circumstances  (over  and  above  those  set  out  in
      paragraphs 399 and 399A of the rules) which could outweigh the  public
      interest in deportation. The respondent acknowledged the appellant had
      remained lawfully in the UK and more than ten years had elapsed  since
      his last  conviction.  It  was  accepted  that  both  the  appellant's
      daughters were British but he had not provided evidence showing he was
      involved in their upbringing, he resided at the same address  as  them
      or that  he  was  able  to  support  them  financially.  Even  if  the
      relationships were accepted, this factor would not outweigh the public
      interest in deportation because the children could remain  in  the  UK
      with the appellant's spouse. Alternatively, it  would  not  be  unduly
      harsh for the children to relocate to Ghana with the appellant.

   7. The respondent accepted that the appellant was living with his spouse.
      However,  this  factor  did  not  outweigh  the  public  interest   in
      deportation either. It was not accepted the appellant had no relatives
      in or ties with  Ghana.  In  relation  to  the  delay  in  making  the
      deportation decision, the notice of decision stated[2]:



         "Records do not provide sufficient detail to be sure as to why your
         case was not referred by the  Prison  Service  to  the  Immigration
         Service ... it is accepted  that  this  error  by  the  responsible
         agencies will have caused you to believe your status in the UK  was
         unaffected by your criminality. Nonetheless, consideration has been
         made in a reasonable timescale since your offending history came to
         light as a result of an NTL application submitted in your  name  in
         2014 and your subsequent detention in 2015 following your  re-entry
         into the UK. The delay is without doubt a  significant  factor  but
         must be balanced against  a  criminal  record  that  itself  is  of
         considerable weight. As such the Secretary of State  has  concluded
         that the balance between your rights and the public interest  still
         lies in you being deported from the UK."



   8. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and his  appeal  was
      heard  at  Taylor  House  on  12  December  2016.  The  appellant  was
      represented by counsel and gave oral evidence, as did his  spouse  and
      his mother. The judge found the evidence  of  the  appellant  and  his
      spouse "cogent and credible". He made the following findings of fact:


    . The appellant had entered the UK at the age of 15 and had  resided  in
      the UK for at least 15 years;
    . The appellant had not committed any offences since 2005;
    . Neither of the appellant's  convictions  were  reported  to  the  Home
      Office by the Prison Service;
    . The appellant's offending only came  to  light  because  an  "identity
      fraudster" had submitted an NTL application in 2014;
    . The first time the appellant became aware of "anything  untoward"  was
      in September 2015 when he was detained;
    . Between the time he last offended and the commencement of  deportation
      proceedings, the appellant had married and become the father of  three
      British children;
    . The appellant had not been aware that his presence in the UK had  been
      "precarious" as a result of his convictions and  neither  he  nor  his
      spouse had been able  to  weigh  up  the  consequences  of  this  when
      planning to start a family;
    . The appellant had undertaken courses aimed at  preventing  reoffending
      during his 2� years in  the  YOI,  although  records  were  no  longer
      available;
    . In relation to the 2005 offence,  the  appellant  had  received  �1800
      compensation following a road traffic accident and he did not know  he
      had to inform the local authority about this;
    . The appellant's eldest child, who was more than seven  years  of  age,
      had been living with him and the appellant's spouse since she was  two
      years old and the appellant is her only parent in the UK;
    . It was not in the child's best interests to live with the appellant in
      Ghana or alone in the UK with her stepmother;
    . The appellant's youngest  child  was  only  two  months  old  and  was
      receiving treatment for significant healthcare concerns; and
    . The appellant's spouse has no family or relatives in Ghana  who  might
      support the family there and they have no home there.




   9. The judge did not refer to the rules relied on by the  respondent  but
      he  directed  himself  to  apply  section  117C  of  the  Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.  He  also  noted  the  respondent's
      internal guidance document, Criminality Guidance  in  Article  8  ECHR
      Cases, v5, 28 July 2014, which stated that,




         "6.7 A foreign criminal may claim that where there has been a delay
         in decision-making (e.g. between the end of the custodial  sentence
         and the decision to deport, or the date of any representations  and
         date of the decision), the public interest in  his  deportation  is
         reduced or his private and/or family life is  strengthened  in  the
         intervening   period   such   that   the   deportation   would   be
         disproportionate. Delay should always be considered  and  explained
         in the assessment of very  compelling  circumstances  even  if  the
         foreign criminal has not relied  on  it  at  this  stage.  ...  The
         consequence of Home Office delay when the foreign criminal  was  in
         the UK lawfully is likely to depend on the  reasons  for,  and  the
         consequences of, the delay on the  foreign  criminal's  family  and
         private life (EB (Kosovo))."




  10. The judge's reasoning for his conclusion that  the  appeal  should  be
      allowed is condensed into five short paragraphs as follows:




         "89. I have noted earlier that there  is  a  seven  year-old  child
         involved in the factual matrix ... and, whilst her  best  interests
         should be respected they are not the only  interests  that  are  in
         play and there is no hard and fast rule that puts her - or  any  of
         the other children in relation to this appeal -  in  possession  of
         any "trump card" that may be  played  to  prevent  the  Appellant's
         deportation.


         90. However, in all the circumstances  of  this  case,  I  have  no
         hesitation in stating that the decision to  deport  him  is  unduly
         harsh both in terms of his own position  -  as  someone  who  never
         realised that he was at risk of this kind of action over a  15-year
         period - and in terms of [the] impact and potentially  catastrophic
         effect on his wife and three children.


         91. None of them realised this  was  ever  a  possibility  and,  in
         reality, if he had realized it was a possibility,  then  fatherhood
         and marriage itself might not have been something he embarked upon.


         92. I find the 17-year delay between conviction and the decision to
         deport and 15-year delay between the Appellant being released  from
         [the] YOI and the  decision  to  deport  constitutes  a  compelling
         circumstance in the context of this appeal and the eventual result.


         93.  This Appellant has been allowed to develop private and  family
         life including that with his wife and three children which  on  its
         own - and taken cumulatively vis-�-vis each of them individually  -
         constitutes  compelling  circumstances  for  why  the  Respondent's
         decision  to  deport  the  Appellant  is  disproportionate  and  an
         infringement of Article  8  as  well  as  being  not  in  the  best
         interests of his three children."




  11. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Parkes on all grounds because,




         "it seems the Judge had been moved by the apparent harshness of the
         decision being made so long after the offences had been  committed.
         That however is not a reason not to deport someone and the  current
         rules had to be applied."




  12. The appellant did not file a rule 24 response opposing the appeal.


  13. We heard submissions from the representatives  on  whether  the  judge
      made a material error of law.

  14. Mr Melvin focused on the first two of the three written grounds  filed
      by the respondent. The first of these argued the judge had misdirected
      himself in law, taken account of irrelevant considerations and  failed
      to give adequate reasons for  his  conclusion  that  there  were  very
      compelling circumstances for the purposes of section 117C(6).  It  was
      insufficient to find the effects of  the  appellant's  deportation  on
      this wife and children would be unduly harsh. Whether the decision was
      unduly harsh on  the  appellant  was  not  a  relevant  consideration.
      Compelling circumstances, as opposed to very compelling circumstances,
      were not enough. The judge had not made a finding that there were very
      compelling circumstances over and above the  other  relevant  factors.
      The judge failed to make any finding as to why it was  not  reasonable
      for the family to relocate to Ghana.  The  second  ground  argued  the
      judge had failed to consider all aspects of the  public  interest,  as
      had been summarised in SSHD v LW (Jamaica) [2016]  EWCA  Civ  369,  at
      paragraph 14.

  15. Mr Melvin relied on two cases.  Firstly,  in  NE-A  (Nigeria)  v  SSHD
      [2017] EWCA Civ 239, the Court of Appeal had reiterated that tribunals
      were bound by law to give effect to Parliament's assessment  that  the
      public interest requires deportation unless there were very compelling
      circumstances over and above the exceptions  provided  for.  Secondly,
      while not shying away from the length of the delay in  this  case,  he
      took us to the  recent  case  of  RLP  (Bah  revisited  -  expeditious
      justice) Jamaica [2017] UKUT  00330  (IAC),  in  which  the  President
      provided guidance that,



         "In cases where the public interest  favouring  deportation  of  an
         immigrant is potent and pressing, even  egregious  and  unjustified
         delay on the part of the  Secretary  of  State  in  the  underlying
         decision making process is unlikely  to  tip  the  balance  in  the
         immigrant's favour in the proportionality  exercise  under  Article
         8(2) ECHR."



  16. For the sake of completeness, we acknowledge the third  ground  which,
      as said, Mr Melvin chose not  to  place  particular  reliance  on.  It
      argued that the judge had erred by failing to explain why he took  the
      view that the delay was caused by the Home Office  in  this  case.  We
      regard Mr Melvin as wise not to pursue this line of  argument  and  we
      incline to agree with Judge Parkes when he commented that,




         "[i]f the delay in making the deportation order was not that of the
         Home Office it would be interesting to know where the fault lay."




  17. Ms Dulay made a robust defence of the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
      allowing the appeal, which she described as "sound". She characterized
      the respondent's submissions as mere disagreement with  the  decision,
      rather than demonstrating any material error of law on the part of the
      judge. In particular, she argued that, even though the judge  referred
      to  compelling  circumstances,   as   opposed   to   very   compelling
      circumstances, he must have had the correct test in  mind  because  he
      had set out the whole of section 117C in paragraph 88 of his decision.
      She also took us to numerous paragraphs  in  the  decision  which,  Ms
      Dulay argued, showed that the decision reflected a full  understanding
      of the public interest in deportation. She placed particular  emphasis
      on paragraph 77 in which the judge said,




         "With a background of time spent in a YOI  for  conspiracy/robbery,
         such a prosecution and such a sentence was inevitable. In  context,
         however, that does not show in my view either similar or  ingrained
         offending and is clearly now so far in the past  -  with  no  other
         convictions - that I do not  find  it  adds  significantly  to  the
         weight of the  criminality  issues  that  I  have  to  consider  in
         relation to the public interest in relation to deporting him."




  18. To make sense of that paragraph it  is  necessary  to  note  that  the
      previous paragraph discussed the impact on the decision  of  the  2005
      conviction for benefit fraud.


  19. Ms Dulay sought to distinguish the facts underlying  the  decision  in
      RLP from those in  the  present  case.  The  important  part  of  that
      decision reads as follows:




         "22. ... The submission of Ms  Rutherford  is  that  this  test  is
         satisfied by reason of  the  extreme  delay  on  the  part  of  the
         Secretary of State during the period 2002  -  2012,  the  hallmarks
         whereof were incompetence and maladministration.


         23. We reject this argument.  On the one hand,  the  delay  on  the
         part of the Secretary of State can only be characterised egregious,
         is  exacerbated  by  the  absence  of  any   explanation   and   is
         presumptively   the   product   of   serious    incompetence    and
         maladministration.  However, on the other hand,  the  case  against
         the Appellant is a formidable one: the public interest favours  his
         deportation;  the  potency  of  this  public  interest   has   been
         emphasised  in  a  series  of  Court  of  Appeal  decisions;    the
         Appellant's case does not fall within any of the statutory or Rules
         exceptions; the greater part of his life was spent in  his  country
         of  origin;  there  is  no  indication  of  a  dearth  of  ties  or
         connections with his  country  of  origin;  he  is  culturally  and
         socially integrated there; his family life in the United Kingdom is
         at best flimsy; and most of his sojourn in the United  Kingdom  has
         been unlawful and precarious. We take into  account  all  of  these
         facts  and  factors  in   determining   whether   very   compelling
         circumstances have been  demonstrated.  This  is  a  self-evidently
         elevated threshold which, by its nature, will be overcome only by a
         powerful case. In our judgement the maladministration and delay  of
         which the Secretary of State is undoubtedly guilty fall  measurably
         short of the mark in displacing the  aforementioned  potent  public
         interest in the Article 8(2) proportionality balancing exercise. We
         conclude that the Appellant's case fails to surpass  the  threshold
         by some distance."



  20. In contrast, the appellant in the present case has always  resided  in
      the UK lawfully, having arrived here as a child. His family  life  was
      well-established  long  before   the   commencement   of   deportation
      proceedings.  Ms Dulay also rightly reminded us  that  the  respondent
      had granted his application for an NTL endorsement in his passport  in
      2004, which was after the conviction for conspiracy/robbery.


  21. We note at this point that we  have  not  had  sight  of  the  judge's
      sentencing remarks in respect of the appellant's convictions and there
      is no indication that  these  were  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
      Neither Mr Melvin nor Ms Dulay had copies. It seems likely that  these
      documents are no longer available in view of the passage of time.

  22. We reserved our decision as to whether the decision of the  First-tier
      Tribunal should be set aside for material error of law  in  accordance
      with section 12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

  23. We remind ourselves of the provisions of Part  VA  of  the  2002  Act,
      which state in relevant part as follows:






         "117A. Application of this Part

         (1)  This Part applies where a court or  tribunal  is  required  to
         determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-

             (a)  breaches a person's right  to  respect  for  private  and
                  family life under Article 8, and

             (b)  as a result would be unlawful  under  section  6  of  the
                  Human Rights Act 1998.

         (2)  In considering the public  interest  question,  the  court  or
         tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

             (a)  in all cases, to the  considerations  listed  in  section
         117B, and

             (b)  in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals,
                  to the considerations listed in section 117C.

         (3)  In subsection (2), "the public interest  question"  means  the
         question of whether  an  interference  with  a  person's  right  to
         respect for private and family  life  is  justified  under  Article
         8(2).

         ...



         117C. Article  8:  additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
         foreign criminals

         (1)   The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

         (3)  ...

         (4)  ...

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public  interest
         requires   deportation   unless   there   are    very    compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2.

         (7)  The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken
         into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to
         deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that  the  reason  for
         the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has
         been convicted."




  24. These provisions and the provisions of  Part  13  of  the  Immigration
      Rules have been the subject of  extensive  analysis  from  the  higher
      courts. A succinct summary of the correct approach  to  article  8  in
      cases governed by the rules was provided by Lord Reed  in  Hesham  Ali
      (Iraq) v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60, at paragraph 50, as follows:


         "In summary, therefore, the tribunal carries out its  task  on  the
         basis of the facts as it finds them to be on  the  evidence  before
         it, and the law as established by statute and case law. Ultimately,
         it has to  decide  whether  deportation  is  proportionate  in  the
         particular case before it, balancing the  strength  of  the  public
         interest in the deportation of the offender against the  impact  on
         private and family life. In doing so, it  should  give  appropriate
         weight to Parliament's and the Secretary of State's assessments  of
         the strength of the general public interest in the  deportation  of
         foreign offenders, as explained in paras 14, 37-38  and  46  above,
         and also consider all factors relevant  to  the  specific  case  in
         question. The critical issue for the  tribunal  will  generally  be
         whether, giving due weight to the strength of the  public  interest
         in the deportation of the offender  in  the  case  before  it,  the
         article 8 claim is sufficiently strong to outweigh it. In  general,
         only a claim which is very strong indeed - very compelling,  as  it
         was put in MF (Nigeria) - will succeed."

  25. In NE-A (Nigeria), the Court of Appeal held that  the  assessment  was
      different in a case governed by section 117C.  Sir  Stephen  Richards,
      with whom McFarlane and Flaux LJJ agreed, stated as follows:




         "13. Mr Buley's submission is that the approach set out  in  Hesham
         Ali is equally applicable to Part 5A  of  the  2002  Act,  so  that
         section 117C(6) is a relevant and important  consideration  in  the
         Article 8 analysis but it does  not  displace  the  proportionality
         assessment to be made by the tribunal on the facts of the case as a
         whole.  He accepts that Hesham Ali was  dealing  specifically  with
         the Rules, not with the statutory provisions.  He also accepts that
         Part 5A of the 2002 Act differs from the Rules  in  being  directed
         specifically to tribunals.  But he submits that the requirement  in
         section  117A(2)  for  the  tribunal  to  "have  regard   to"   the
         considerations in sections 117B and 117C  is  precisely  consistent
         with the analysis in Hesham Ali and that  this  approach  preserves
         the well-established and well  understood  role  of  the  appellate
         decision-maker.  It leaves the tribunal to perform its  established
         task of determining whether there is a breach of Article 8, instead
         of substituting a statutory  test  for  that  question.   Mr  Buley
         emphasises the distinction between, on the one hand, a  requirement
         to have regard to a statement of policy which reflects the view  of
         Parliament and, on the other hand, a  requirement  to  conduct  the
         analysis within a statutory formula.


         14.  I would reject that line of argument.   In  my  judgment,  the
         analysis of section 117C(6) in Rhuppiah is correct  and  should  be
         followed.  There is no inconsistency between that analysis and what
         was said in Hesham Ali.   The focus in Hesham Ali, as  is conceded,
         was on the Rules: indeed, Lord Reed noted in terms at  paragraph  2
         of his judgment that it was unnecessary to consider the  amendments
         to the legislation effected by the Immigration Act 2014,  i.e.  the
         provisions of Part 5A of the 2002 Act.  Moreover, integral to  Lord
         Reed's reasoning was  that  the  Rules  "are  not  law  ...  but  a
         statement of the Secretary of State's administrative practice"  and
         they "do not  therefore  possess  the  same  degree  of  democratic
         legitimacy as legislation made by Parliament"  (paragraph  17;  see
         also paragraph 53); and that they do not govern appellate decision-
         making, although they are relevant to the determination of  appeals
         (paragraph 41).  Part 5A of the 2002 Act, by contrast,  is  primary
         legislation directed to tribunals  and  governing  their  decision-
         making in relation to Article 8 claims in the  context  of  appeals
         under the Immigration Acts.  I see no  reason  to  doubt  what  was
         common ground in Rhuppiah and was drawn from  NA  (Pakistan),  that
         sections 117A-117D, taken together, are intended to provide  for  a
         structured approach to the application of Article 8 which  produces
         in all cases a final result which is compatible with Article 8.  In
         particular, if in working through the structured approach one  gets
         to section  117C(6),  the  proper  application  of  that  provision
         produces a final result compatible with Article 8 in all  cases  to
         which it applies.  The provision contains more than a statement  of
         policy to which regard must be had  as  a  relevant  consideration.
         Parliament's  assessment  that  "the   public   interest   requires
         deportation unless there are very  compelling  circumstances,  over
         and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2" is  one  to  which
         the tribunal is bound by law to give effect.


         15.  None of this is problematic  for  the  proper  application  of
         Article 8.  That a requirement of "very  compelling  circumstances"
         in order to outweigh the public  interest  in  the  deportation  of
         foreign criminals sentenced to at least four years' imprisonment is
         compatible with Article 8 was  accepted  in  MF  (Nigeria)  and  in
         Hesham Ali itself.  Of course, the  provision  to  that  effect  in
         section 117C(6) must  not  be  applied  as  if  it  contained  some
         abstract statutory formula.  The context is that of  the  balancing
         exercise under Article 8, and the "very  compelling  circumstances"
         required are circumstances sufficient to outweigh the strong public
         interest in the deportation of  the  foreign  criminals  concerned.
         Provided that a tribunal has  that  context  in  mind,  however,  a
         finding that "very compelling circumstances" do not exist in a case
         to which section 117C(6)  applies  will  produce  a  final  result,
         compatible with  Article  8,  that  the  public  interest  requires
         deportation.  There is no room for any additional  element  in  the
         proportionality balancing exercise under Article 8."



  26. The analysis of Sales LJ in Rhuppiah v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 803,  with
      which the court agreed, is encapsulated in the following passage[3]:



        "50. ...  The  'very  compelling  circumstances'  test  in  section
        117C(3) and (6) provides a safety valve, with an appropriately high
        threshold of application, for  those  exceptional  cases  involving
        foreign  criminals  in  which   the   private   and   family   life
        considerations are so strong that it would be disproportionate  and
        in violation of Article 8 to remove them. If, after working through
        the decision-making framework in section 117C, a court or  tribunal
        concludes that it is a case in which section 117C(3)  or  (6)  says
        that the public interest 'requires' deportation, it is not open  to
        the court or tribunal to deny this and  to  hold  that  the  public
        interest does not require deportation."


  27. Finally, we would mention that the Supreme  Court  in  R  (Kiarie  and
      Byndloss) v SSHD [2017] UKSC 42 provided a non-exhaustive list of  the
      kinds  of  matters  which  a  tribunal  might  consider  to  be  "very
      compelling reasons" for finding that a foreign criminal had  succeeded
      in negotiating the "formidable hurdle" imposed. These are[4]:

         "(a) the depth of the appellant's  integration  in  UK  society  in
         terms of family, employment and otherwise;
         (b) the quality of his relationship  with  any  child,  partner  or
         other family member in the UK;
         (c) the extent to which any relationship with family members  might
         reasonably be sustained even after deportation,  whether  by  their
         joining him abroad or otherwise;
         (d) the impact of his deportation on  the  need  to  safeguard  and
         promote the welfare of any child in the UK;
         (e) the likely strength of the obstacles to his integration in  the
         society of the country of his nationality;  and,  surely  in  every
         case,
         (f) any significant risk of his re-offending in the UK, judged,  no
         doubt with difficulty, in the light  of  his  criminal  record  set
         against the credibility of his probable assertions of  remorse  and
         reform."

Error of law?
  28. Part VA came into force on 28 July 2014 and it was therefore incumbent
      on the judge in this case to have regard to its provisions. We note in
      passing that, whilst the judge referred to section 117C,  he  made  no
      reference to section 117B, as he  was  required  to  do.  We  do  not,
      however, suggest this error was material to the outcome of the  appeal
      because the judge was plainly aware of the  fact  this  appellant  had
      always had leave. The issues  for  us  are  (1)  whether  the  judge's
      assessment of the public  interest  and  his  application  of  section
      117C(6) were legally sound and, if not,  (2)  whether  his  error  was
      material in the sense another tribunal could have come to a  different
      conclusion on the found facts.


  29.  Having  carefully  scrutinised  his  decision  and   considered   the
      submissions of the representatives, we have  come  to  the  conclusion
      that the judge's decision contains significant errors.

  30. Whilst not simply applying an  "abstract  statutory  formula",  it  is
      plain that the judge, in order to make a properly structured decision,
      was  required  to  give  reasons  and  to  identify  "very  compelling
      circumstances", over and above those described in the Exceptions (only
      Exception 2, described in section 117C(5), appears to have been argued
      in this appeal).

  31. Whether or not, as a matter of  construction,  when  applying  section
      117C(6) it is first necessary to show that the appellant falls  within
      the Exception  before  moving  on  to  identify  the  very  compelling
      circumstances was discussed in Akinyemi v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 236, at
      paragraph 14. The  court  in  that  case  preferred  a  more  flexible
      approach. However, whatever the correct approach, our reading  of  the
      decision in this case shows the judge  muddled  the  concepts  and  so
      failed to follow a sufficiently structured approach.

  32. As  said,  the  reasoning  contained  in  the  decision  in  the  five
      paragraphs set out above is brief.  Paragraph  90  might  be  said  to
      contain a finding that Exception 2 was met in respect of the impact of
      deportation on both the appellant's wife and the three  children.  The
      impact would, by  any  measure,  be  deemed  harsh.  However,  section
      117C(5) shows the appellant must show that the impact would be  unduly
      harsh. The brief statement by the judge that he has no  hesitation  in
      stating the decision is unduly harsh does not  assist  the  reader  to
      know why he came to that conclusion.

  33. The Upper Tribunal in MAB (para 399: "unduly harsh") USA  [2015]  UKUT
      00435 (IAC) provided some textual analysis of the rules:

         "2. Whether the consequences of deportation will be "unduly  harsh"
         for an individual involves more than "uncomfortable,  inconvenient,
         undesirable,  unwelcome  or  merely  difficult   and   challenging"
         consequences and imposes a considerably  more  elevated  or  higher
         threshold.


         3. The consequences for an individual will be "harsh" if  they  are
         "severe" or "bleak" and they  will  be  "unduly"  so  if  they  are
         'inordinately' or 'excessively' harsh taking into  account  of  all
         the circumstances of the individual."



  34. In this case, the judge has simply failed to provide adequate  reasons
      why such an elevated threshold has been met. Furthermore, by referring
      in paragraph 90 to the appellant's own position, the judge  has  taken
      into account an irrelevant consideration.  Section  117C(5)  is  clear
      that the effect of the deportation on the partner and  child  are  the
      relevant considerations in play.


  35. The paragraphs which follow also show a degree of laxity  in  the  way
      the judge has grappled with the statutory test. By twice referring  to
      compelling   circumstances[5],   as   opposed   to   very   compelling
      circumstances, we are driven to conclude the judge may  not  have  had
      correct test in mind  notwithstanding  his  citation  of  the  law  at
      paragraph 88. In other circumstances, the omission of  the  qualifying
      word might not have led us to  hold  serious  concerns.  However,  the
      context of this appeal is crucial because, as seen from  the  passages
      set out above,  the  higher  courts  have  repeatedly  emphasised  the
      extremely high threshold which Parliament has decided to impose before
      the public interest can be outweighed.

  36.  The absence of detailed reasoning in these paragraphs also  leads  us
      to agree with the respondent that the judge has not provided  adequate
      reasons for his conclusion that section 117C(6) has been met.  Whether
      or not the judge was required to conduct a  full  balancing  exercise,
      having regard to the statutory provisions, or merely to  work  through
      the section so as to deliver an article 8-compliant result, the  judge
      has not in  this  case  provided  adequate  reasons  for  his  overall
      conclusion.

  37. We therefore turn to the second question, which is whether the  errors
      identified are material.  We  have  pondered  whether  a  differently-
      constituted tribunal, starting from the findings of fact made by Judge
      Callender Smith, which we would preserve, would also have to find  the
      decision breached article 8. This is not a line of argument adopted by
      Ms Dulay so we heard no submissions on it.


  38. The most striking feature of this case, as the judge  clearly  had  in
      mind, is the delay. We are in little doubt that this could and  should
      be regarded  as  a  feature  of  the  assessment  of  very  compelling
      circumstances, the search for which is wide-ranging, as shown  by  the
      list provided in Kiarie and  Byndloss.   It  is  acknowledged  in  the
      respondent's own guidance that, in the case of an individual  who  has
      lived in the UK with  leave,  this  factor  may  be  significant.  The
      reference there to the case of EB (Kosovo) v SSHD [2008] UKHL 41  must
      be to the guidance of Lord Bingham as follows:

         "13. In Strbac v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005]
         EWCA Civ 848, [2005] Imm AR 504, para 25, counsel for the applicant
         was understood to contend, in effect, that if the  decision  on  an
         application for leave to enter or remain was made after the  expiry
         of an unreasonable period of time, and  if  the  application  would
         probably have met with success, or a greater chance of success,  if
         it had been decided within a reasonable time, and if the  applicant
         had in the meantime established a family life in this  country,  he
         should be treated when the decision is ultimately made  as  if  the
         decision had been made at that earlier time. For reasons  given  by
         Laws LJ, the Court of Appeal rejected this submission, for which it
         held Shala v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWCA
         Civ 233, [2003] INLR 349 to  be  no  authority.  While  I  consider
         that Shala was correctly decided on its facts, I am satisfied that
         the Court of Appeal was right to  reject  this  submission.  As  Mr
         Sales QC for the respondent pointed  out,  there  is  no  specified
         period within which, or at which, an immigration decision  must  be
         made; the facts, and with them government policy, may change over a
         period, as they did here; and the duty of the decision-maker is  to
         have regard to the  facts,  and  any  policy  in  force,  when  the
         decision is made. Mr Drabble QC, for the appellant,  did  not  make
         this submission, and he was right not to do so.
         14. It does not, however, follow that delay in the  decision-making
         process  is  necessarily  irrelevant  to  the  decision.  It   may,
         depending on the facts, be relevant  in  any  one  of  three  ways.
         First, the applicant may during the period  of  any  delay  develop
         closer personal and social ties and establish deeper roots  in  the
         community than he could have shown earlier. The longer  the  period
         of the delay, the likelier this is to be true. To the  extent  that
         it is true, the applicant's claim under article 8 will  necessarily
         be strengthened. It is unnecessary to elaborate  this  point  since
         the respondent accepts it.
         15. Delay may be relevant  in  a  second,  less  obvious,  way.  An
         immigrant without leave to enter or remain is in a very  precarious
         situation, liable to be removed at any time. Any relationship  into
         which  such  an  applicant  enters  is  likely  to  be,  initially,
         tentative, being entered into under  the  shadow  of  severance  by
         administrative order. This is the more true where the  other  party
         to  the  relationship  is  aware  of  the  applicant's   precarious
         position. This has been treated as relevant to the quality  of  the
         relationship. Thus in R (Ajoh) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
         Department [2007] EWCA Civ 655, para 11, it was noted that "It was
         reasonable to expect that both  [the  applicant]  and  her  husband
         would be aware of her precarious immigration status". This reflects
         the  Strasbourg  court's  listing  of  factors  relevant   to   the
         proportionality  of  removing  an  immigrant  convicted  of  crime:
         "whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time when  he  or
         she  entered  into   a   family   relationship"   see Boultif   v
         Switzerland (2001) 33 EHRR 50, para 48; Mokrani v France (2003) 40
         EHRR 123, para 30. A relationship  so  entered  into  may  well  be
         imbued with a sense of impermanence. But if months pass  without  a
         decision to remove being made, and months become  years,  and  year
         succeeds year, it is to be expected that this sense of impermanence
         will fade and the expectation will grow that if the authorities had
         intended to remove the applicant they would have taken steps to  do
         so.  This  result  depends  on  no  legal  doctrine   but   on   an
         understanding of how, in some cases, minds  may  work  and  it  may
         affect the proportionality of removal.
         16.  Delay  may  be  relevant,  thirdly,  in  reducing  the  weight
         otherwise to be accorded to  the  requirements  of  firm  and  fair
         immigration control, if the delay is shown to be the  result  of  a
         dysfunctional system which yields unpredictable,  inconsistent  and
         unfair outcomes. In the present case the  appellant's  cousin,  who
         entered the country and applied for asylum at  the  same  time  and
         whose position is not said to be materially different, was  granted
         exceptional leave to remain, during the two-year  period  which  it
         took the respondent to correct its erroneous decision to refuse the
         appellant's application on grounds of non-compliance. In  the  case
         of JL (Sierra Leone), heard by the Court of Appeal at the same time
         as the present case, there was a somewhat similar pattern of facts.
         JL escaped from Sierra Leone with her half  brother  in  1999,  and
         claimed asylum. In 2000 her claim was refused on  grounds  of  non-
         compliance. As in the appellant's case this decision was erroneous,
         as the respondent recognised eighteen  months  later.  In  February
         2006 the half brother was granted humanitarian protection. She  was
         not. A system so operating  cannot  be  said  to  be  "predictable,
         consistent and fair as between one applicant  and  another"  or  as
         yielding "consistency of treatment between one  aspiring  immigrant
         and another". To the extent that this is shown to  be  so,  it  may
         have a bearing on the proportionality of removal, or  of  requiring
         an applicant to apply from out of country. As Carnwath LJ  observed
         in Akaeke v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA
         Civ 947, [2005] INLR 575, para 25:
                 "Once it is accepted that unreasonable delay on the part of
                 the Secretary of State  is  capable  of  being  a  relevant
                 factor, then the weight to be given to it in the particular
                 case was a matter for the tribunal""



  39. Whilst  their  Lordships  were  not  considering  delay  in  making  a
      deportation decision following a conviction,  we  see  no  reason  why
      these  principles  should  not  be  adapted  for  application   in   a
      deportation appeal, provided the facts are somewhat distant from those
      considered in RLP. In the latter case, the President  was  considering
      delay in the context of an individual who was already an overstayer by
      the time he married and went on to commit offences.
  40. Does the length of the delay in this case, which we  calculate  to  be
      precisely 15 years[6], coupled with the appellant's formation of solid
      family and private  life  ties  in  the  UK  whilst  ignorant  of  his
      vulnerability to deportation, mean that his case is bound  to  succeed
      before another tribunal? We do not think so. It is undoubtedly a  very
      important factor and we accept Ms Dulay's submission  that  this  case
      can be distinguished from RLP on its facts. However,  it  is  possible
      that another tribunal, properly directing  itself,  would  nonetheless
      consider that  the  appellant  had  not  reached  the  extremely  high
      threshold  of  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above   the
      Exceptions. There are insufficient findings of fact for us to conclude
      otherwise. Moreover, the factual  circumstances  will  have  moved  on
      since December 2016, particularly with regard  to  the  third  child's
      health.

  41. The decision is set aside. The parties were not prepared to proceed to
      a continuation hearing. We consider the appeal must be remitted to the
      First-tier Tribunal  in  line  with  paragraph  7.2  of  the  Practice
      Direction so that further facts can be found.

  42. The appeal must be heard  by  a  different  Judge  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal. To assist with that task we make the following directions:




                                 DIRECTIONS




      (1) The appeal will be heard by any Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal
      except Judge Callender Smith on a date and at a place to be notified;
      (2) The  findings made by Judge Callender Smith in paragraphs 65 to 80
      of his decision and summarised in paragraph  8  of  ours  (above)  are
      preserved;
      (3) Consolidated bundles containing all additional  evidence  and  the
      evidence previously filed must be filed at the Tribunal and served  on
      the other party no later than 14 days before the hearing.




NOTICE OF DECISION

     The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal made a material error of  law  and
    his decision dismissing the appeal is set aside.  The  appeal  will  be
    heard again in the First-tier Tribunal.

     An anonymity direction has not been made.

                               Signed                 Date 17 August 2017




                               Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal Froom
-----------------------
[1] We note the appellant's passport was endorsed with a correction so that
his date of birth should read 18 January 1981 and this date was recorded on
the residence permit, issued by the Home Office on 22 June 2004. His
solicitors also gave his date of birth as 18 January 1981 in correspondence
but the Home Office has continued to record his date of birth as 18 January
1980, which was transposed into the FTT's decision.
[2] See paragraph 45.
[3] See paragraph 7 of NE-A.
[4] See Lord Wilson at paragraph 55.
[5] See paragraphs 92 and 93.
[6] The period between the appellant's conviction for the index offence and
the service of the decision to deport him ran from September 2000 to
September 2015.
