Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Khan, Bukhari Chambers Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are all nationals of  India.  They  are  respectively  a
    husband,  wife  and  their  two  minor  children.  They   appeal   with
    permission[1] the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Lloyd-
    Smith)[2] to dismiss their linked appeals against a decision to  remove
    them from the United Kingdom pursuant to s10  of  the  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 1999.

 2. This family came to be in the UK because Mrs Parveen came to work here,
    as a nurse. Her husband followed, and then their  children.  They  were
    all given leave to enter as work permit holders/dependents. Mrs Parveen
    arrived in 2003, Mr Mukarram in 2004, Ali in February  2005  and  Syeda
    was brought here by Mrs Parveen in March 2006. Before returning to  the
    UK with her daughter in 2006 Mrs Parveen lost her job, and having  been
    notified of that, the Respondent curtailed her leave as a  work  permit
    holder.  A further application was refused so that by the 18th November
    2007 the  whole  family  were  served  with  notices  confirming  their
    liability to be removed from the UK[3]. Having unsuccessfully  appealed
    that decision[4] they were asked to report to their  local  immigration
    enforcement office but failed to  do  so.    They  did  not  leave  the
    country. On the 4th July 2012 they made applications  'outside  of  the
    Rules' to be permitted to remain in the UK on Article 8 grounds.

 3. The chronology is not entirely clear  but  it  would  appear  that  the
    Respondent simply refused to grant any leave.  The family,  having  had
    no valid leave at the point that their applications were made,  had  no
    right of appeal. Judicial review proceedings  were  launched  with  the
    result that on the 8th April 2014 the Respondent agreed a consent order
    to the effect that the applications would be  considered  afresh  under
    the 'new rules', ie those introduced on the 9th July 2012, just  a  few
    days after these applications were made. The result was a  decision  to
    remove under s10, giving rise to these appeals. The reasons for refusal
    letter is dated the 5th July 2014. Therein the  Respondent  considered,
    and refused, leave under Appendix FM of the Rules:  this  decision  has
    never been challenged. The letter goes on to consider paragraph 276ADE,
    the provision concerning private life.

 4. The Respondent found that neither adult could qualify for  leave  under
    this Rule.  Neither had been here long enough, nor lost their  ties  to
    India. Again, that decision is not challenged.    The  Respondent  then
    turned to the position of the  children.    The  letter  concedes  that
    there are no known grounds for refusal on  'suitability'  grounds,  but
    since neither child had, at the date of application, lived  in  the  UK
    for a continuous period of seven years,  their  applications  too  were
    dismissed.   The  letter  goes  on  to  address  s55  of  the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2009.  The  Respondent  considers  it
    reasonable for the children to return to  India.  They  can  speak,  or
    become re-acquianted, with the language. They will have the support  of
    their parents. They will be  able  to  receive  an  education.  Weighed
    against the children's position is the fact that they  have  been  here
    without leave since 2007, and that their parents have worked  illegally
    following curtailment of that leave.

 5. When the matter came before the First-tier Tribunal then, the only live
    issue was whether the children could defeat  the  decisions  to  remove
    with reference to their private lives in the UK.  Judge Lloyd-Smith had
    regard to the decision in the 2007 appeal  (against  curtailment).  The
    First-tier Tribunal on that occasion had found  that  Mrs  Parveen  had
    understood the requirements of the work permit scheme and that in  2006
    she had come back from a trip to India well aware that she had  no  job
    to come back to.  She had given inconsistent evidence about whether the
    family had a home in India to go back  to.  Judge  Lloyd-Smith  adopted
    these  findings,  which  accorded  with  her  own  assessment  of   the
    witnesses. She found that the adult Appellants had not told  the  truth
    about their lack of financial, social and family ties  to  India.   She
    found that it had been their intention  to  settle  in  the  UK.  Their
    decision in 2008 to overstay after their appeal rights  were  exhausted
    showed a "blatant disregard for  immigration  control".   Judge  Lloyd-
    Smith found that the parents  had  deliberately  overstayed  until  the
    children  had  lived  here  seven  years,  in  order  to   make   these
    applications: "the family  buried  their  head  in  the  sand,  avoided
    removal so as to get an education for their children and strengthen the
    argument that it would be unfair to  remove  them".   She  agreed  that
    neither child had been in the  UK  for  seven  years  at  the  date  of
    application and went on to consider the matter under  Article  8  ECHR.
    In doing so she considered the  relevant  authorities:  Zoumbas[5],  EV
    (Philippines)[6] , ZH (Tanzania)[7] and Azimi-Moeyed[8]. She took  into
    account that the children are in education in the  UK,  and  that  this
    would inevitably be disrupted by their departure, although any  adverse
    consequences were mitigated by the fact that neither were at a  crucial
    stage of their education. The determination also considers  the  impact
    that moving would have on the children's  private  lives,  noting  that
    they had  both  moved  to  the  UK  from  India  without  any  apparent
    difficulty.  Finally it is recognised that even if the children's  best
    interests can be said to lie in remaining in  the  UK,  these  must  be
    balanced  against  the  public  interest  in  maintaining   immigration
    control; these parents have deliberately sought to  remain  in  the  UK
    without any leave long enough  to  rely  on  their  children's  private
    lives. They were aware in 2007, or at the very latest January 2008 when
    they became 'appeal rights exhausted' that it was time  to  leave,  but
    they did not. Any adverse consequences for their  children  arise  from
    that decision.

    Submissions

 6. The grounds of appeal are that the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  the
    following material respects:

      i) Unclear and contradictory findings in respect of Syeda's education.
         At paragraph 22 the determination notes that she is at a  "critical
         point" in her studies, yet goes  on  to  find  that  there  are  no
         obstacles in  her  carrying  on  her  education  in  India.  It  is
         submitted that the determination fails to make  clear  findings  on
         whether interference with her education (Syeda was  about  to  take
         her 'A' levels at the date of the appeal) would be contrary to  her
         best interests.

     ii) Failure to consider material facts, in that Furqaan had  been  here
         since he was 3 and knew no other education system. It is  submitted
         that the determination  is  flawed  for  failing  to  consider  how
         Furqaan would deal with a move to India and a new system.

    iii) Misdirection in law. The Judge  proceeded  to  consider  Article  8
         'outside of the rules' on the basis that neither child  could  meet
         the 'seven-year'  requirement  of  276ADE(1)(iv)  at  the  date  of
         application. It  is  submitted  that  she  should  have  considered
         whether the children in this in-country appeal met the  requirement
         of the Rule. Even  if  the  appeal  could  not  have  been  allowed
         outright under the Rules, whether they were  met  was  relevant  to
         Article 8.

     iv) Placing undue weight on the negative factors, and failing  to  give
         appropriate weight to the positives, namely the fact that this is a
         family who have worked hard to integrate, by for instance  speaking
         fluent English and being financially independent.

 7. Mr McVeety submitted that all of the findings made  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal were  open  to  it.   The  grounds  focus  on  the  "right  to
    education" of the younger Appellants but fail  to  recognise  that  the
    education these children have been getting was at  tax-payers  expense;
    since at the latest January 2008 it is an education that they were  not
    entitled to.   Furthermore the Judge made clear findings that India had
    a functioning education  system  and  there  was  therefore  no  unduly
    adverse consequence for the children of returning there.

    My Findings

 8. Ground (iii) is made out.  At paragraph 19 of the determination  it  is
    noted that the child must have been living continuously in the  UK  for
    at least seven years prior to  the  application  being  made;  although
    there in the context of E-LTRP.2.2 this is the  same  wording  as  sub-
    paragraph (i) of 276ADE. The First-tier Tribunal  appears  to  conclude
    that this basic qualifying length of residence has  not  been  reached.
    Before me the parties agreed that in  fact  it  had.    Although  these
    cases with their refusals, judicial  reviews  and  consent  orders  can
    sometimes obscure the date of application, in  this  case  Furqaan  had
    already passed the seven year mark at the point his  parents  made  the
    applications in July 2012.   By the time of the hearing Syeda had  been
    in the UK some 8� years and Furqaan 9� years.    On  appeal  they  both
    relied on 276ADE and were entitled to do so. See GEN.1.9 of Appendix FM
    and indeed paragraph 276A0 (iii):

         '276A0. For the purposes of paragraph 276ADE(1) the requirement  to
         make a valid application will not apply when the Article 8 claim is
         raised:

         (i) as part of an asylum claim, or as part of a further  submission
         in person after an asylum claim has been refused;

         (ii) where a migrant is in  immigration  detention.  A  migrant  in
         immigration detention  or  their  representative  must  submit  any
         application or claim raising Article  8  to  a  prison  officer,  a
         prisoner custody officer, a detainee custody officer or a member of
         Home Office staff at the migrant's place of detention; or

         (iii) in an appeal (subject to the  consent  of  the  Secretary  of
         State where applicable).'

    The starting point for consideration  of  their  private  lives  should
    therefore have been the Rule rather than  Article  8  'outside  of  the
    Rules'.  The question is whether, had the Tribunal used this framework,
    it would have made any difference to the outcome of this case.

 9. In considering whether it is "reasonable" for a child to leave  the  UK
    the decision-maker must canvass exactly the same factual considerations
    as she would when considering classic Article 8.  The only  distinction
    between the two exercises is the starting point.   In applying  Article
    8 the decision-maker must already have in her mind that  the  applicant
    has failed under the Rules; she is looking for particular factors  that
    would render removal unjustifiably harsh or disproportionate[9]. In the
    vast majority of cases the simple fact that they  do  not  qualify  for
    leave to remain under the law is sufficient for the Secretary of  State
    to  show  the  decision  to  remove   proportionate:   that   is   what
    'exceptional' means.

10.  Paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv)  does  not  however  use  the   language   of
    "compelling"  or  "exceptional"  nor   indeed   "proportionate".    The
    background to this rule is the long-standing recognition by  government
    that once a child has  spent  seven  years  in  the  UK  he  will  have
    integrated to a degree that it  will  not  normally  be  reasonable  to
    remove him.  Originally formulated in the concession  known  as  DP5/96
    that  policy,  and  those  which  followed,  created  a  general,   but
    rebuttable,  presumption that enforcement action  would  generally  not
    proceed  in  cases  where  a  child  had  accumulated  seven  years  of
    residence[10].   This position was affirmed in the policy statement[11]
    which accompanied the introduction  of  paragraph  276ADE  (1)(iv):  "a
    period of 7 continuous years spent in the UK as a child will  generally
    establish a sufficient level of integration for family and private life
    to exist such that removal would normally not be in the best  interests
    of the child" [my emphasis].  The current guidance,  issued  after  the
    introduction of the word "reasonable" into the Rule,  underlines   that
    this  remains  the  starting  point.    The   Immigration   Directorate
    Instruction 'Family Migration: Appendix FM Section 1.0b Family Life (as
    a Partner or Parent) and Private Life:  10-Year  Routes'   ("the  IDI")
    states as follows:

         '11.2.4. Would it be unreasonable to expect a  non-British  Citizen
         child to leave the UK?

         The requirement that a non-British Citizen child has lived  in  the
         UK for a continuous period of at  least  the  7  years  immediately
         preceding the  date  of  application,  recognises  that  over  time
         children start to put down roots and integrate into life in the UK,
         to  the  extent  that  being  required  to  leave  the  UK  may  be
         unreasonable. The longer the child has resided in the UK, the  more
         the balance will begin to swing in terms of it  being  unreasonable
         to expect the child to leave the UK, and  strong  reasons  will  be
         required in order to refuse a case with continuous UK residence  of
         more than 7 years.

         The  decision  maker  must  consider  whether,  in   the   specific
         circumstances of the case, it would be  reasonable  to  expect  the
         child to live in another country.

         The decision maker must consider the facts relating to  each  child
         in the UK in the family individually, and  also  consider  all  the
         facts relating to the family as a whole. The decision maker  should
         also engage with any  specific  issues  explicitly  raised  by  the
         family, by each child or on behalf of each child.'

11. This then, is the starting point  for  consideration  under  the  Rule.
    Where a child has lived in the UK  for  seven  years  or  more  "strong
    reasons" will be required to refuse him leave to remain.  That is quite
    different from the starting point under classic Article 8.

12. Could the outcome in this case have been different had  the  First-tier
    Tribunal applied this framework rather than simply moving on to Article
    8?  For the reasons very clearly and carefully set out by Judge  Lloyd-
    Smith, the answer must be no. She found there to be very strong reasons
    why these children should be refused leave  to  remain  notwithstanding
    their long residence. Those  strong  countervailing  reasons  were,  in
    short, the cynical and unlawful behaviour of  their  parents.  In  2006
    they brought Syeda to the UK and kept Furqaan  here  knowing  that  Mrs
    Parveen had lost her job and that her status as  a  work-permit  holder
    was precarious. From that point on they understood  that  they  had  no
    right to remain in the UK under the Rules and yet they did  not  leave.
    They enrolled the children in school and, as Judge Lloyd-Smith puts it,
    "buried their heads in the sand".   When Mrs Parveen finally  lost  her
    appeal in January 2008 they could  have  returned  to  India  with  the
    children then, causing  minimal  disruption  to  their  educations  and
    private lives (I note that these were children who had moved  countries
    before, having lived in Saudi Arabia).  The adult Appellants  evidently
    believed that by overstaying until Furqaan had reached the  seven  year
    mark they could secure leave to remain  for  the  whole  family.  Judge
    Lloyd-Smith was right to characterise that behaviour  as  cynical,  and
    contrary to the best interests of their children.  On the findings that
    she made, the appeal would have failed under 276ADE(1)(iv) just  as  it
    failed under Article 8.

13. It perhaps follows that I find no merit in the remaining  grounds.  The
    core complaint is that the Tribunal failed to give  appropriate  weight
    to the education of the children, and  the  disruption  that  would  be
    caused  to  them  by  removal.  Contrary  to  what  is  said   in   the
    determination I am told that  Syeda  is  at  a  crucial  stage  of  her
    education, being in the middle of her 'A' levels. It is true  that  the
    Tribunal has not recognised that feature of the evidence. That said the
    author of the grounds completely overlooks the fact that these children
    were not, at any point since late 2007, entitled to the education  that
    they have now received courtesy of the  tax-payer.   Disruption  to  an
    education will always be a relevant factor in  an  assessment  such  as
    this, but it is extremely unlikely to be  determinative.  I  find  that
    Judge Lloyd-Smith conducted a fair and measured balancing exercise. She
    has recognised that the children's predicament is not their  fault  and
    that there will inevitably be some disruption to their  lives  if  they
    are removed. There were however strong countervailing factors  in  this
    case which displaced  the  presumption  that  these  long-residents  be
    permitted to stay. Those were her findings  and  she  was  entitled  to
    reach them on the evidence that was before her.

    Decisions

14. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an  error
    of law and it is upheld.

15. I was not asked to make a direction for anonymity.
