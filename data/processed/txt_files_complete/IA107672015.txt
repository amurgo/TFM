For the Respondent:    No appearance


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State but I will refer  to  the
      original appellant, a citizen of Bangladesh born on 2 January 1987, as
      the appellant herein.

   2. The appellant did not appear before me and he did  not  appear  before
      the First-tier Tribunal. I was satisfied that due notice of the appeal
      date and venue had  been  given  and  that  no  explanation  had  been
      received for his non-attendance and that  it  was  right  in  all  the
      circumstances and in the interests of justice to proceed under rule 35
      of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).

   3. The appellant first  arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  4
      (General) Student on 19 February 2012 and  his  leave  to  remain  was
      subsequently extended until 18 August 2014 in the same capacity.

   4. However, an application for leave to remain  as  a  Tier  2  (General)
      Migrant on 18  August  2014  was  refused  on  4  March  2015  as  the
      respondent considered the appellant  had  not  provided  the  evidence
      required to support the application and he did not have the  requisite
      number of points required under the points based system.

   5. The appellant appealed and his appeal came before a  First-tier  Judge
      on 1 March 2016. The judge dealt with the  appeal  on  the  papers  as
      requested by the appellant and with the agreement of the respondent.

   6. The judge records that the appellant  relied  on  general  grounds  of
      appeal: the decision was not in accordance  with  the  rules,  it  was
      unlawful because it was incompatible with the appellant's rights under
      the European Convention on Human  Rights  and  was  otherwise  not  in
      accordance with the law. It was further argued that discretion  should
      have been exercised differently.

   7. The judge pointed out that the respondent had lodged an appeal  bundle
      but that there was none from the appellant.

   8. The judge noted that the respondent contended that the  appellant  had
      not provided a valid certificate of sponsorship reference number.  The
      licence should be provided by a Tier 2  Licensed  sponsor.  The  judge
      concluded paragraph 8 of his determination as follows:

           "In the light of the lack of evidence I found that the appellant
           had not discharged his burden  of  proof  on  this  issue  under
           Appendix A of the Rules."

   9. In paragraph 9 the judge records that the  appellant  was  awarded  10
      points under English language but no points in respect of  maintenance
      because he did not provide evidence of sufficient funds for the period
      as specified in Appendix C of the rules. The respondent concluded that
      the appellant had not provided evidence that  he  had  maintained  the
      minimum level of available funds throughout the full 90 day period  as
      specified under the Rules.

  10. The judge concluded paragraph 9 of his determination as follows:

           "The appellant on the basis of the bank statement only held  the
           sum of ï¿½945 from June to 12 August 2014, before this period  the
           account was below the required level. I make a finding that  [in
           the] light of a lack of evidence by the appellant to show the he
           did have the required amount for the specified period under  the
           Rules, that the appellant has not discharged the burden of proof
           to the required standard."

  11. Given these findings the next paragraph is  somewhat  of  a  surprise.
      Under the heading "Decision" the judge states:

           "Appeal allowed under the immigration Rules".

  12. The respondent applied for  permission  to  appeal  pointing  out  the
      inconsistency and requesting the determination be  amended  under  the
      slip rule (Rule 31) alternatively that the determination was  arguably
      irrational given the findings.

  13. Permission to appeal  was  granted  on  5  September  2016  given  the
      apparent  inconsistency  in  the  determination.  Permission  was  not
      granted on the slip rule point.

  14. Mr Bramble relied on the grounds and  submitted  that  the  judge  had
      clearly intended to dismiss the appeal. He  had  not  dealt  with  the
      human rights aspect. Reference was made to Patel v Secretary of  State
      [2013] UKSC 72. The judge had considered the appeal on the  papers  as
      requested. I was asked to substitute a fresh decision  dismissing  the
      appellant's appeal.

  15. At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.

  16. The appellant has played no part in  these  proceedings  and  has  not
      responded to the grant of permission. It is quite clear  on  any  fair
      reading of the determination that the judge intended  to  dismiss  the
      appeal rather than allow it. The judge did not deal  with  Article  8.
      However, there has been no response  from  the  appellant  seeking  to
      support the determination on other  grounds.  What  is  said  by  Lord
      Carnwath at paragraph 57 in Patel is of particular relevance  in  this
      case, the appellant being a student:

           "It is important to remember that article 8  is  not  a  general
           dispensing power. It is to be distinguished from  the  Secretary
           of State's discretion to  allow  leave  to  remain  outside  the
           rules, which may be unrelated to any protected human right.  The
           merits of a decision not  to  depart  from  the  rules  are  not
           reviewable on appeal: section 86(6).  One  may  sympathise  with
           Sedley  LJ's  call  in  Pankina  for  "common  sense"   in   the
           application of the rules to graduates who have been studying  in
           the UK for  some  years  (see  para  47  above).  However,  such
           considerations do not by themselves provide  grounds  of  appeal
           under article 8, which is concerned with private or family life,
           not education as such. The opportunity for a  promising  student
           to complete his course in this  country,  however  desirable  in
           general terms, is not in itself a right protected under  article
           8."

  17. I can see no basis in this case  for  allowing  the  appeal  on  human
      rights  grounds.  The  points  made  by   Mr   Bramble   are   plainly
      unanswerable. The judge clearly intended to dismiss the appeal.

  18. The determination is flawed by a material error of law.

  19. I substitute a fresh decision:

      The appellant's appeal is dismissed under the rules.


      The appeal is dismissed under Article 8.



Anonymity Direction.

The First-tier Judge made no Anonymity Order and I make none.


Fee Award

The judge purported to make a fee award but in the light of  my  conclusions
the appellant is not entitled to a fee award.
