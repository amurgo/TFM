                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr R Clarke, Counsel, instructed by Hafiz & Haque
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

1.   The appellants were refused  further  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Migrant and dependant.  Their appeals against these  refusals
    were allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Hawden-Beal.

2.    Because  the  appeals  were  allowed  at  the  First-tier,  under  the
    Immigration Rules, the appellant in the Upper Tribunal is the Secretary
    of State.  For clarity and convenience, however, I am referring to  the
    parties as they were before the First-tier.

3.   The Secretary of State was given permission  to  appeal  by  Designated
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal McClure, on 2 May 2014.

4.   At the hearing before me Mr Jarvis, for  the  respondent,  applied  for
    consent to withdraw the respondent's case, with reference to Rule 17 of
    the Upper Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2008.   He  did  so  because  he
    accepted that the Document Verification Report considered by the  judge
    did not have the relevant attachment included.  It  therefore  amounted
    to a non-evidenced allegation that a financial document was false.   He
    accepted that there was therefore no requirement for rebuttal  evidence
    from the appellants.

5.   Mr Clarke, for the appellants, had no comment to make.

6.   I gave the consent of the Tribunal to the withdrawal of  the  Secretary
    of State's case.

7.   As a result of  the  withdrawal  the  judge's  decision  allowing  both
    appeals under the Immigration Rules stands.



Signed                                  Date


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Gibb
