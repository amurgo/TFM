For the appellant:     Not represented
For the respondent:    Mr D Clark, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Narem Marcano Jimenez,  date  of  birth  28.5.84,  is  a
    citizen of Venezuela.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Roopnarine-Davies promulgated 27.2.15, dismissing on all  grounds
    the appellant's appeal against  the decision of the Secretary of State,
    dated 29.10.14, to refuse her asylum, humanitarian protection and human
    rights claims.  The Judge heard the appeal on 9.2.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Garratt  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    26.3.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 13.5.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below, I find no material error of law  in  the
    making of the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  such  that  the
    determination of Judge Roopnarine-Davies should be set aside.

 6. The case is unusual. As  her  asylum  claim  was  made,  the  appellant
    asserted that she had a well-founded fear of persecution on grounds  of
    her conversion to Islam in December  2010.  She  claims  to  have  been
    verbally abused and physically assaulted as a result of her  faith  and
    believes that if she is returned to Venezuela, she will be killed.  She
    claims that unknown people, and for unknown reasons, have  been  asking
    her  family  about  her  whereabouts.  Nevertheless,  because  internal
    relocation is open to the appellant and sufficiency  of  protection  is
    available for Muslim converts in Venezuela, her asylum and humanitarian
    protection claims were rejected. The human rights, private  and  family
    life, claim was also rejected, the Secretary of State considering  that
    the marriage was one of convenience and that in any event the appellant
    could not meet the requirements of Appendix FM in  relation  to  family
    life with a partner, or paragraph 276ADE in relation to  private  life.
    The Secretary of State  also  found  that  medical  treatment  for  her
    condition was available in Venezuela and that her removal would not  be
    disproportionate.

 7. In the refusal decision, the  Secretary  of  State  accepted  that  the
    appellant was a Muslim convert and that  she  had  been  assaulted  and
    verbally abused because of her faith. However, Judge  Roopnarine-Davies
    went behind those concessions to find at �15 of the decision  that  the
    claim to be a Muslim convert has been fabricated, and at �18  that  the
    appellant did not suffer verbal abuse or was assaulted in Venezuela.

 8. However, at the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing,  the  asylum  claim
    was withdrawn by the appellant's representative, accepting  that  there
    was  sufficiency  of  protection  in   Venezuela.   Neither   was   the
    humanitarian protection claim pursued. Nevertheless, the appellant gave
    oral evidence, essentially reiterating the factual basis of her  asylum
    claim. It follows that the judge was faced with a contradiction between
    the withdrawal of the asylum claim and the evidence  of  the  appellant
    insisting that she was at risk. In the circumstances, it  was  open  to
    the judge to go behind the concessions made by the Secretary  of  State
    in the refusal decision. The First-tier  Tribunal  was  faced  with  an
    entirely different situation to that prevailing  when  the  asylum  and
    other claims were considered by the Secretary of State.

 9. In his submissions, Mr Clark referred me to SSHD v Maheshwaran   [2002]
    EWCA Civ 173, the Court of Appeal considered as too broadly  drawn  the
    submission that that if the Secretary of State does  not  challenge  an
    assertion of fact made by a claimant and the  (judge)  does  not  raise
    with the claimant doubts about the veracity of the assertion, the judge
    is bound to accept the assertion as proved, if not  to  do  so  may  be
    material to his determination (decision). The Court of Appeal  accepted
    that to fail to put to a party a point which is decided against him can
    be grossly unfair and lead to injustice. Where  a  point  is  expressly
    conceded by one party it will usually be  unfair  to  decide  the  case
    against the other party on the basis that the  concession  was  wrongly
    made, unless the Tribunal indicates that it  is  minded  to  take  that
    course. The present  case  is  rather  different.  Here  the  appellant
    abandoned both  the  asylum  and  humanitarian  protection  claims  and
    pursued only the Article 8 private  and  family  life  claim.  For  the
    appellant then to pursue in oral evidence a case which was inconsistent
    with that course of action put the issue fairly  before  the  judge  to
    consider and resolve what she made of the appellant's factual  account.
    It would have been obvious to all concerned that the  appellant's  oral
    evidence was at odds with  the  decision  to  abandon  the  asylum  and
    humanitarian protection claim. In the circumstances, on  the  facts  of
    this case, there was no material error  of  law  in  going  behind  the
    concession.

10. In any event, the findings in dispute were not material to the  outcome
    of the appeal, as both the asylum and  humanitarian  protection  claims
    were effectively abandoned.  The  only  material  issue  remaining  was
    whether it was proportionate to require the appellant to leave  the  UK
    to make an Appendix FM application as a spouse from Venezuela. To  that
    end, the judge  was  entitled  to  make  findings  as  to  whether  the
    appellant met the requirements  of  either  Appendix  FM  or  paragraph
    276ADE and to consider whether there were exceptional circumstances  in
    the appellant's case, compelling features inadequately addressed in the
    Rules so  as  to  render  the  removal  decision  unjustifiably  harsh.
    Clearly, in order to answer that question the  judge  had  to  consider
    whether the circumstances claimed to prevail in Venezuela rendered  the
    appellant's case exceptional. The judge went on to  conclude  that  the
    appellant's  evidence  was  not  truthful  and  her  account   of   her
    relationship fabricated.

11. In passing, I should mention that in her submissions to me, Ms  Jimenez
    sought to adduce some further evidence. I explained that at this 'error
    of law' stage I could only consider evidence that was before the First-
    tier Tribunal at the time of the decision. She  took  particular  issue
    with the inconsistencies set out in �17 of the decision, especially the
    finding that she and her husband had lived together prior to  marriage.
    She claimed that they had married on 17.1.14 but the  Islamic  marriage
    ceremony certificate produced to the Tribunal stated that the  marriage
    was 'solemnised' at the Darussalam Cultural Centre on 19.2.14. She  now
    wished to produce to me a different certification that was  not  before
    the First-tier Tribunal, stating that the marriage in fact  took  place
    on 17.1.14. She stated that the certificate which was before the First-
    tier Tribunal was dated the date of her request, not the  date  of  the
    marriage. However, it remains the case that on the evidence before  the
    First-tier Tribunal the earliest evidence of marriage was  19.2.14.  In
    the circumstances, regardless of what further  evidence  the  appellant
    may now have on that issue, the findings of the  judge  on  this  issue
    were open to her on the available evidence and for which cogent reasons
    have been given.

12. The  appellant's  representative  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal  appeal
    hearing accepted that she did not meet the requirements of Appendix FM.
    No reliance was placed on private life and it was  not  suggested  that
    she met paragraph 276ADE.

13. Despite reaching the view that the marriage was one of convenience  and
    not genuine, the judge took the appellant's case on Article  8  at  its
    highest, as is clear from �21 of the decision. The  judge  went  on  to
    consider family life outside the Rules on the basis of Article 8  ECHR,
    and found  that  there  was  nothing  to  prevent  the  appellant  from
    returning to Venezuela  to  make  application  for  entry  from  there,
    consistent with  the  Immigration  Rules  and  thus  that  the  removal
    decision was proportionate. Those are sustainable findings supported by
    the evidence and findings of the judge and for which  cogent  reasoning
    has been provided. There was no specific appeal against those findings;
    in essence, the grounds assert that going behind the concessions of the
    Secretary of State unfairly infected the judge's approach to Article 8.
    I do not accept that  contention.  The  issue  as  to  whether  it  was
    proportionate for the appellant to make her application from  Venezuela
    is not dependent on the asylum and  humanitarian  protection  findings,
    though the safety of the appellant was highly relevant to the issue  of
    proportionality. It follows that  there  is  no  merit  in  any  appeal
    against the decision of the Tribunal in respect of human rights.

14. Further, the recent Court of Appeal case of Agyarko  &  others  v  SSHD
    [2015] EWCA Civ 440, considered the situation  of  illegal  overstayers
    who  commenced  a  relationship  or  married  a  British   citizen   in
    circumstances of known precariousness of the  kind  referred  to  in  R
    (Nagre) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720(Admin), dismissing the appeals  of  both
    appellants whose applications for leave to  remain  outside  the  Rules
    were  refused  by  the  Secretary  of  State  and  subsequent   appeals
    dismissed. That the appellant cannot meet the requirements of the Rules
    is a highly relevant factor. Further the Tribunal is required  to  have
    regard in any proportionality assessment to the public interest factors
    of section 117B of the 2002 Act, including that immigration control  is
    deemed to be in the public interest and that little  weight  should  be
    accorded to a relationship developed whilst the appellant is unlawfully
    present in the UK, being  an  overstayer.  There  are  no  children  to
    consider in this case. The appellant  established  her  claimed  family
    life with knowledge that she had no right to be in the UK and  thus  it
    was precarious in the relevant sense. At held at  �28  of  Agyarko,  in
    those circumstances it is only if her  case  is  exceptional  for  some
    reason that she will be able to establish a violation of Article 8.  As
    found by the First-tier Tribunal there  were  no  such  exceptional  or
    compelling circumstances insufficiently recognised in  the  Immigration
    Rules so as to justify granting leave to remain outside  the  Rules  on
    the basis of Article 8 ECHR family life, because otherwise the decision
    to remove would be either disproportionate or unjustifiably harsh.

Conclusions:

15. In the circumstances, for the reasons stated, there is no merit in  the
    grounds of appeal. Even if there were errors of law in the judge  going
    behind the concessions  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  they  were  not
    material to the remaining issue in the appeal  as  to  whether  it  was
    disproportionate to the appellant's Article 8 family rights to  require
    her to leave  the  UK  and  make  such  application  as  she  considers
    necessary for entry clearance.

16. I thus find that the making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    did not involve the making of an error on a point of law such that  the
    decision should be set aside.

                  I do not set aside the decision.

                  The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  stands  and  the
                  appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
