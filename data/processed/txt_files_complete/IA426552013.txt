For the Appellant:     Mohammed Kamrul Hasan of Kalam solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This appeal has been brought by  the  appellant  whose  application  to
  remain the United Kingdom as a Tier 4  (General)  Student  Migrant  under
  Points Based System and for a Biometric Residence Permit was  refused  by
  the Secretary of State and an appeal brought against  that  decision  was
  heard and dismissed by Judge Morgan, a Judge of the First  Tier  Tribunal
  following a hearing at Taylor House on 18 June 2014 for reasons  set  out
  in the determination promulgated on 25 June 2014.


2.   The appellant was granted permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
  by Judge Landes, a Judge of the First Tier Tribunal for reasons given  in
  his decision dated 5 September  2014.  The  appellant  is  a  citizen  of
  Bangladesh. His date of birth is 12 August 1981.

3.   The appellant's application  for  further  leave  to  remain  had  been
  refused by the respondent on the ground that he h been unable to meet the
  requirements of paragraph 245ZX of the Immigration Rules. The sole  issue
  before  Judge  Morgan  had  been  whether  the  current  application,  if
  successful would cause the appellant to have spent more than  five  years
  in the United Kingdom as a student studying courses at  degree  level  or
  above. It was the respondent's position  that  if  the  application  were
  granted it would lead the appellant to spend  64  months  in  the  United
  Kingdom. Judge Morgan  rejected  the  argument  made  on  behalf  of  the
  appellant that the respondent's sums are based  on  including  the  three
  years that he was studying for an ACCA qualification. The Judge  did  not
  accept the argument that the appellant had not and could not have studied
  for three years as the license of the Institution had been  suspended  by
  the respondent and that the course was not a degree course.

4.   At the hearing before  me  the  respondent's  representative  described
  ground 1 of the application as misconceived and agreed that ground 2  was
  of "real substance". Ground 2 states, "The FTJ also erroneously  rejected
  the argument that the ACCA course should not be counted towards the  five
  years  for  the  purposes  of  245  ZX  (ha)  [paragraph  7  of  pf   the
  determination] Reliance  is  placed  on  Mirza  (ACCA  Fundamental  Level
  qualification - not recognised degree) [2013] UKUT 41  (IAC)  states  the
  following at paragraph 39: Even if we were wrong in our conclusion above,
  it cannot be argued, in our judgment, that  the  qualification  has  been
  'designated' by he ACCA as being of Bachelor's degree . Indeed  the  fact
  that the ACCA encourages students to obtain a  separate  and  independent
  degree from Oxford Brookes University, because this would  enhance  their
  qualifications, suggests that ACCA recognise  that  their  qualifications
  are not categorised  as  a  degree."  He  summed  up  by  describing  the
  situation as a "Mess".

5.    Counsel for  the  appellant  argued  that  the  appellant  had  always
  remained in the United  Kingdom  lawfully  pursuing  his  education.   He
  pointed out that it quite misleading on the part  of  the  respondent  to
  suggest that the appellant had not been in the  United  Kingdom  lawfully
  throughout. He had once been refused further  leave  to  remain  and  his
  appeal against that decision had been allowed in September. I reserved my
  decision, which I now give with reasons.

6.   In my judgement Judge Morgan materially erred  in  law  in  failing  to
  engage with the wording of the paragraph 245 ZX.  In my  respectful  view
  if he had, Judge Morgan would have accepted the  force  of  the  argument
  that the  time  that  the  appellant  had  spent  in  studying  for  ACCA
  qualification could not be included in the five-year period. ACCA is  not
  a degree level or above course. Furthermore the appellant  had  not  been
  "studying courses" throughout his stay in the United  Kingdom  at  degree
  level or above because his educational institution had lost  its  license
  for no fault of the appellant.  I have of course looked at the  decisions
  of a Upper Tribunal in Mirza [2013] UKUT 00041 (IAC) and Islam [2013 UKUT
  000608.  I note what has been said  in  Islam  in  Paragraph  11  of  its
  determination. Although if looked at  cursorily  it  supports  the  stand
  taken by the respondent. However the facts in this appeal are  materially
  different in that the appellant did not drop out of any course. He  could
  not study for part of the relevant period  because  the  license  of  his
  educational establishment was suspended.







7.   In my judgement, Judge Morgan's decision  to  dismiss  the  appeal  was
  materially flawed in law and I therefore set it aside.  In  remaking  the
  decision I allow the appeal for the reasons given above.
