                    DECISION AND REASONS ON ERROR OF LAW

The appeal

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh, born on 2 April 1988. On 16
       March 2014, she married Mr Mohammed Raja Hussain ("the sponsor"), who
       is a British  citizen  born  on  1  April  1970.  She  then  made  an
       application for entry clearance as a partner under Appendix FM of the
       Immigration Rules, HC395. On 17 September 2015, the respondent  Entry
       Clearance Officer refused the application because:
         . As a result of  checks  being  made  with  HMRC  concerning  the
           sponsor's  claimed  income,  it  was   considered   that   false
           information had been provided (paragraph S-EC.2.2(a) of Appendix
           FM of the Immigration Rules);
         . Insufficient evidence had been provided to show the marriage was
           genuine and subsisting and that the  parties  intended  to  live
           together permanently in the UK (paragraphs E-ECP.2.6 and 2.10 of
           Appendix FM);
         .  The  sponsor's  gross  income  was  below  the  minimum  income
           requirement  of  �18,600  per  annum  (paragraph  E-ECP.3.1   of
           Appendix FM); and
         . The application  did  not  raise  exceptional  circumstances  to
           warrant a grant of leave outside the rules on article 8 grounds.

    2. The appeal was heard in the First-tier Tribunal,  sitting  at  Taylor
       House, London, on 10 April 2017. The judge heard  evidence  from  the
       sponsor and submissions from the parties' representatives. The  judge
       was told by the sponsor that his income had greatly increased shortly
       before the appellant made her application for entry clearance and the
       judge was  shown  bank  statements  to  support  this.  However,  she
       concluded she could not be satisfied the appellant's bank account had
       not been manipulated in order  to  present  a  particular  (that  is,
       false) state of affairs. Again, with regard to the relationship,  she
       was not satisfied there was sufficient evidence of contact to show  a
       genuine and subsisting relationship existed. It followed there was no
       family life to engage article 8.

    3. The grounds seeking permission  to  appeal  argued  there  were  five
       material errors of law in the judge's decision:
         . The judge had misdirected herself by stating the burden of proof
           rested on the appellant: it rested on the respondent to show the
           marriage was a sham;
         . The judge applied a "reasonable suspicion" test, as opposed to a
           balance of probabilities;
         . The judge should have found the minimum income  requirement  was
           met on the basis of the  documentary  evidence  provided,  which
           complied with the requirements of the rules;
         . The burden of proving dishonesty was on the respondent  but  the
           judge directed herself that the burden rested on the  appellant;
           and
         . The judge had applied a "reasonable suspicion" test in  relation
           to the evidence of the sponsor's income and, if she had concerns
           that  there  was  no  additional  evidence  from  the  sponsor's
           employer, she should have  adjourned  the  appeal  to  give  the
           appellant an opportunity to get the evidence.

    4. Permission to appeal was granted by the First-tier Tribunal in rather
       obscure terms:
           "1. ...
           2. The grounds assert that the Judge erred in the assessment  of
           Family life, financial requirements and the burden of proof.
           3. Permission is granted."

    5. The respondent has filed a rule 24 response opposing the appeal. This
       argues that the judge gave cogent reasons for rejecting the sponsor's
       claimed salary increase. She also gave  reasons  for  concluding  the
       marriage was not genuine or subsisting. The decision  was  adequately
       reasoned and revealed no material error of law.

    6. I heard submissions  from  the  representatives  as  to  whether  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of law.



Decision on error of law

    7. Mr Khan did not adopt the grounds seeking permission to appeal, which
       he had not drafted. In particular, he did not  argue  the  judge  had
       misapplied the burden of proof. That seems perfectly right given  the
       judge directed herself  correctly  as  to  the  general  position  at
       paragraph 10. Of course, where the respondent asserts that  deception
       has been used, the burden is on the decision-maker to  establish  any
       contested facts. The civil standard of proof applies.

    8. There is no document verification report in this case. The judge  did
       not make a finding of deception. She found the documents submitted as
       evidence of the sponsor's financial circumstances did not satisfy her
       that the sponsor was earning the minimum  required  of  �18,600.  The
       burden rested on the appellant on a balance of probabilities to  show
       the minimum income requirement was met and she  failed  to  discharge
       that burden. There is no error in the decision of the kind  suggested
       in the grounds.

    9. Mr Khan, after changing his position, confirmed he  was  not  arguing
       the judge's findings were  perverse.  That  also  seems  a  perfectly
       sensible approach. In R (Iran and Others v SSHD) [2005] EWCA Civ  982
       Brooke LJ set out the test for perversity as follows:
           "11. ... It is well known that "perversity"  represents  a  very
           high hurdle. In Miftari v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ  481,  the  whole
           court agreed that  the  word  meant  what  it  said:  it  was  a
           demanding concept. The majority of the court (Keene and  Maurice
           Kay LJJ) said that it embraced decisions that were irrational or
           unreasonable in the Wednesbury  sense  (even  if  there  was  no
           willful or conscious departure from the rational), but  it  also
           included a finding of fact that was wholly  unsupported  by  the
           evidence, provided always that  this  was  a  finding  as  to  a
           material matter."

   10.  Mr  Khan  did  not  point  to  anything  in  the  decision   showing
       irrationality or unreasonable on the part of the judge. He  suggested
       there was ample evidence capable of showing a subsisting relationship
       and most judges would have found in favour of the appellant. However,
       the fact other judges would have come to a different decision is  not
       the test. Moreover, the issue of the relationship had to be looked at
       in the round with the evidence of  finance.  An  adverse  credibility
       finding with regard to one  matter  was  likely  to  enter  into  the
       assessment of others.

   11. Mr Khan pointed to the evidence of the  sponsor's  salary  which  had
       been before the judge, including a P60 and annual tax summary.  These
       both showed gross income of �18,600. However, it cannot be  said  the
       judge overlooked or misunderstood material evidence.  She  was  fully
       aware of the  documents  purporting  to  show  the  sponsor's  income
       reached the minimum income requirement (see paragraph 19).

   12. The point was that she did not accept  this  evidence  represented  a
       true state of affairs. She was entitled to infer from the absence  of
       further documents showing the sponsor continued to earn  that  amount
       that the situation had been manipulated,  as  she  put  it,  and  the
       sponsor's claim to have had a substantial pay rise was not  reliable.
       She noted the very large pay rise  had  apparently  been  given  just
       before the application was  to  be  made.  She  noted  the  sponsor's
       evidence, as set out in his statement, that he had received pay rises
       over a period of time, did not accord with  the  oral  evidence.  She
       noted  the  lateness  of  the  production  of  the   sponsor's   bank
       statements. She noted the  unexplained  deposit  of  �1500  from  the
       employer into the sponsor's account.   There  is  no  error  in  this
       reasoning.

   13. I note that no additional evidence has been filed on  behalf  of  the
       appellant showing the sponsor did continue to receive  the  increased
       salary. The sponsor did not attend the hearing. I note the employer's
       letter in the appellant's bundle did not state his salary or  mention
       the pay rise, let alone the reason for it.

   14. Mr Khan did not adopt the grounds seeking permission to appeal to the
       extent they relied on case law relevant to EEA cases on  marriage  of
       convenience. That was not the issue before the judge  in  this  case.
       She had only to decide whether the evidence showed  the  relationship
       was genuine and subsisting. The burden rested on the  appellant.  She
       noted there was hardly any evidence of communication. Her finding was
       open to her on the evidence.

   15. To the extent Mr Khan relied on the points made in the grounds  about
       the judge employing the  wrong  standard  of  proof,  namely  one  of
       reasonable suspicion, I reject them. The judge was entitled  for  the
       reasons she gave to find the evidence of the sponsor's  finances  was
       unreliable and therefore the minimum income requirement had not  been
       met. Likewise, she was entitled to  find  the  relationship  was  not
       genuine or subsisting due to the lack of cogent evidence. The judge's
       findings were fully reasoned and based on the evidence. The  decision
       does not contain any error of law and shall stand.

NOTICE OF DECISION

       The appeal is dismissed. The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal did not
       make a material error of law and her decision dismissing  the  appeal
       is upheld.

       An anonymity direction has not been made.
