Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Bandegani instructed by Duncan Lewis & Co
                    solicitors (Harrow)
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    appellant in  this  determination  identified  as  AS.  This  direction
    applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any  failure  to  comply  with
    this direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings

      1. First-tier Tribunal Judge McCarthy dismissed the appellant's appeal
         against a  decision  of  the  respondent  refusing  his  claim  for
         international protection. That decision was upheld by  DUTJ  Doyle.
         The Court of Appeal, by consent, remitted the appeal to  the  Upper
         Tribunal and set out the respondent's acknowledgement that

             "...the country information and guidance  documents  published
             in February 2015 contains both guidance and  policy  statement
             (sections 1.3 and 1.4). The  respondent  further  acknowledges
             that as conceded before the Upper Tribunal,  she  is  under  a
             duty to draw the First-tier Tribunal's attention to any policy
             or guidance which might have a bearing on the decision in  the
             case but that she had in this instance failed to do so."

      2. The appellant sought  and  was  granted  permission  to  amend  the
         grounds of appeal relied upon.  Ms  Isherwood  submitted  that  any
         error of law was not material  because,  when  the  documents  were
         considered as a whole in the context of  the  evidence  before  the
         judge, the finding that the appellant  would  not  be  at  risk  on
         return to Kabul was sustainable.

      3. The respondent did not challenge the findings of fact made by First-
         tier Tribunal Judge McCarthy.  The  judge  failed  to  have  proper
         regard to the documentary evidence in assessing the risk on return.

      4. On 27th September  2018  I  found  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         materially erred in law and set aside the decision  dismissing  the
         appeal, all findings of fact retained.

      5. The relevant findings of fact made by the First-tier Tribunal Judge
         and the factual matrix relied upon  by  the  appellant  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal which was not challenged was as follows:

          i) The SSHD  accepts  that  AS  had  a  business  in  Afghanistan
             supplying goods to the US Coalition Forces in October 2011 and
             January 2013 and this could be  perceived  as  supporting  the
             coalition forces;

         ii) He visited Bagram airfield base,  had  appointments  with  the
             military's contracting officers and visited the military bases
             often;

        iii) AS received three  letters  from  the  Taliban  and  telephone
             calls. Each letter was addressed to the appellant in his  home
             village in Laghman; he received telephone calls in Kabul;

         iv) The third letter, in February  2014,  threatened  Shariah  law
             would be inflicted - the death penalty;

          v) AS reported the threats to the police;

         vi) AS' account is generally credible;

        vii) The Taliban's interest in AS developed over time;

       viii) AS no longer worked after  February  2014  when  he  moved  to
             Kabul;

         ix) AS left Afghanistan on 27th April 2014 and arrived in  the  UK
             on 27th May 2014 and claimed asylum shortly thereafter.

      6. I adjourned the hearing on 27th  September  2018;  I  directed  the
         respondent file full copies of  their  policy  documents  and  gave
         leave to both parties to file such further country material as they
         sought to rely upon, to file and serve skeleton arguments and  that
         the  hearing  on  29th  November  2018  would  proceed  by  way  of
         submissions only, no oral evidence.

      7. The appellant, in the event, filed a further witness statement.  Ms
         Isherwood did not, after consideration, seek  permission  to  cross
         examine the appellant but, in submissions drew  attention  to  what
         she stated were inconsistencies between that witness statement  and
         the appellant's earlier evidence which undermined the findings made
         and retained. She also urged that little or  no  weight  be  placed
         upon the witness statement in  assessing  the  appellant's  current
         circumstances and risk. Mr Bandegani submitted that there  were  no
         inconsistencies between the recent witness statement  and  previous
         evidence and that the current witness statement was simply  a  more
         economical and shortened form of evidence he had previously  given;
         whilst acknowledging that great weight could not be placed upon it,
         it  was  nevertheless  a  statement  of  the  appellant's   current
         circumstances and some weight should be given accordingly.

         Appellant's supplementary statement.

      8. In his most recent witness statement, dated 31st October  2018,  AS
         said, inter alia:

             "2.  To confirm, as stated in my previous statement, my family
             are no longer living in Laghman Province in Afghanistan. After
             they  were  refused  stay  in  Pakistan,  they   returned   to
             Afghanistan in 2014 and began living in Arzanqimat  in  Kabul,
             where they are currently living.

             3.   Sometime in 2016, I cannot remember the date,  my  father
             told me that a group of Taliban  men  wearing  scarves  around
             their faces, came to the house in Arzanqimat. He told me  they
             searched around the house and interrogated my father about  my
             whereabouts....

             4.   I have been told by my dad that this has happened  a  few
             times over the past few years with the  most  recent  occasion
             being around a month ago .....I feel bad that they all have to
             go through this and that they had to leave Laghman because  of
             me. My dad has told me that each time the Taliban come to  the
             house, the same things happen...

             5.   I do not think my family's life is in danger  because  it
             is me who they want; but my family are  still  being  harassed
             about my whereabouts. I do not know how  they  knew  where  my
             family relocated to but this is what I have  been  saying  all
             along; the Taliban have agents all over the country - even  in
             Kabul - and can always discover the whereabouts of someone."

      9. Ms Isherwood submitted that the appellant's evidence had changed:

             (a)  In paragraph 10 of his first witness statement dated  9th
             October 2014 (WS1) he said "...I returned home to  Laghman  in
             March 2013 when my dad showed me a letter that my cousin...had
             given him the day before..."

             (b)  In paragraph  12  WS1,  he  said,  "In  December  2013  I
             received a second letter from the Taliban. My cousin...dropped
             this off at my house, again while I was out of the house..."

             (c)  In paragraph 13 WS1, he said "On 24th  February  2014  at
             around 4pm, I was at home eating lunch with my family when  we
             heard a knock on the door".

             (d)  According to the substantive interview record  (responses
             to questions 28, 29, 79, 88-104) the appellant and his  family
             had returned to Afghanistan, Laghman about five  years  before
             the interview; the appellant's family were in Laghman and  the
             appellant was living with his family. Yet  the  appellant  was
             also saying that his family were in Pakistan and Kabul but the
             letters in 2013 were delivered to the family home in Laghman.

     10.  Ms  Isherwood  submitted  that  there  were  inconsistencies   and
         contradictions in the evidence such as to undermine the findings of
         the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  were  retained  from  the  earlier
         proceedings. There had been no challenge by the respondent  to  the
         findings of the First-tier Tribunal in the earlier  proceedings.  I
         note that the appellant's bundle was not served until late although
         Ms Isherwood had received the appellant's witness statement by  7th
         November. Her skeleton argument, dated 27th November 2018, does not
         take issue with the retained facts although there is a reference to
         the  bundle  being  filed  outside  the  period  specified  by  the
         directions which "suggest that other matters may  be  argued.  This
         will be addressed at the hearing". Mr  Bandegani  did  not  deviate
         from his skeleton or the bundle of documents.

     11. Although not addressed in her skeleton argument I  have  considered
         Ms Isherwood's objections to the evidence given by AS in  his  most
         recent witness statement and have given careful attention  to  what
         she has described as inconsistencies and contradictions.

     12. I note that the appellant speaks fluent English. This is  commented
         upon in the substantive interview record and the appellant says  he
         studied in Pakistan. His brother worked as an interpreter  for  the
         Americans and is now in the USA, married to a  US  citizen.  During
         the substantive interview, which took place on  18thJune  2014,  AS
         said that when he was  small  he  and  his  parents  had  moved  to
         Peshawar  in  Pakistan  as  refugees;   they   received   financial
         assistance from the UNHCR. He thought they had  lived  in  Pakistan
         for "over 10 years". They had remained in Pakistan and  about  five
         years before his interview had returned to Afghanistan.  This would
         have been about 2009 /2010. During the substantive  interview,  the
         appellant said that he had been living in Laghman, Kabul, Jalalabad
         (see questions 28, 79, 86). He said that  after  the  third  letter
         (February 2014) he went to Kabul and rented a house for him and his
         family. He said he left in April and  his  family  remained  living
         there for three months; they told him they  would  go  to  Pakistan
         after he left. He spoke to his father on 28th  May  2014  and  they
         were in Peshawar but were being bothered by the police because they
         didn't have documents (see questions 121 -124).

     13. I do not agree with Ms Isherwood that the appellant's evidence  has
         changed. The most recent witness statement is in  short  form  but,
         when the earlier witness statement and  the  substantive  interview
         record are considered fully, and not just  the  selective  extracts
         commented upon by Ms Isherwood, it is plain that  his  account  has
         been consistent throughout.

     14. The appellant was not cross examined by Ms Isherwood.  I  gave  her
         the opportunity to make an application to cross-examine him,  given
         that my earlier directions were  that  there  was  to  be  no  oral
         evidence, but she declined to make such an application. She did not
         seek to have the  witness  statement  excluded  from  evidence  and
         relied upon her submissions as to changed evidence (which I reject)
         and that there should be no,  or  little  weight  placed  upon  his
         assertion in the witness statement that the  Taliban  came  to  the
         home in Kabul. Where a witness has not given oral evidence, and  in
         this case I have never heard the appellant give oral evidence, then
         witness statement  evidence  must  be  approached  with  particular
         caution. In this appeal, the appellant has been found  credible  by
         the First-tier Tribunal, who heard  him  give  oral  evidence.  His
         evidence has continued to be consistent and  I  am  satisfied  that
         there is nothing said that can dislodge the findings of the  First-
         tier Tribunal judge that  his  account  is  generally  credible.  I
         decline to place no weight upon  the  witness  statement  but  such
         weight as I do place upon it is  in  the  context  of  the  country
         material that is before me. It is not determinative of his appeal.

     15. I note the submissions by Mr Bandegani that even if I were to place
         no weight at all upon the statement, the country evidence  is  such
         that this appellant is at real risk of being persecuted because  of
         his work as a subcontractor providing goods for  the  US  Coalition
         forces, he has had three letters,  received  threatening  telephone
         calls and has been sentenced.

     16. In addition to  the  report  by  Dr  Giustozzi  prepared  for  this
         appellant, the  country  material  relied  upon  by  the  appellant
         includes:

           . Home Office  Country  Information  and  Guidance  Afghanistan:
             persons supporting or  perceived  to  support  the  government
             and/or international forces February 2015

           .  Home  Office  Country  Information   and   Information   Note
             Afghanistan: fear of anti-government elements (AGEs) version 2
             December 2016

           . Home Office Country Policy and Information  Note  Afghanistan:
             unaccompanied children version 1 April 2018

           . EASO Country Guidance: Afghanistan June 2018

           . UNAMA 15 July 2018

     17. My attention was also drawn specifically to AS  (Safety  of  Kabul)
         Afghanistan CG [2018]  UKUT  00118  (IAC)  by  both  advocates.  Ms
         Isherwood submitted that the expert report by Dr Giustozzi did  not
         undermine the guidance provided  in  AS  and  did  not  support  Mr
         Bandegani's submission that the evidence before me was such  as  to
         enable a departure from or enhancement of the  risk  categories  in
         AS; this appellant  was  not,  she  submitted,  at  risk  of  being
         persecuted on the retained findings of fact. I note that  the  EASO
         report and the UNAMA report post-date AS CG.

     18. Mr Bandegani referred to Batayav [2003] EWCA Civ 1489 in support of
         his submission that the assessment of risk set out by Dr  Giustozzi
         amounts to a real risk:  the  evaluation  of  conditions  that  are
         alleged to create a real risk are not to be considered in terms  of
         being "frequent" or "routine" unless "systematic" or  "consistently
         happening". "A real risk  is  in  language  and  in  law  something
         distinctly less than a probability, and it cannot  be  elevated  by
         lexicographic stages into something more than it is"[1].

     19. Ms Isherwood forcefully submitted that Dr Giustozzi's report, dated
         21st November 2018 and prepared on this appellant, did not disclose
         material that enabled a departure from the CG case of AS; that  his
         report was not significantly  different  to  that  which  had  been
         before the Upper Tribunal in AS CG and that  his  report  had  been
         found lacking in AS CG because it  lacked  verifiable  sources  and
         gave inadequate detail. She referred to many of his  sources  being
         "old",  some  dating  as  long  ago  as  2006.  References  in  her
         submissions included:

          a)  The  references  by  Dr  Giustozzi  to  the  existence  of  a
             'blacklist' of those collaborators identified by  the  Taliban
             were rejected by the Tribunal in  AS  CG[2]  and  the  current
             report did not provide any further evidence to  support  their
             existence.

          b) In �175 of AS, the Tribunal took the view that the evidence of
             such a blacklist came from only a limited  number  of  Taliban
             sources, was not supported by other commentators and that some
             aspects of the evidence as to its size  and  comprehensiveness
             undermined a conclusion that it existed.

          c) The appellant had not said he had been sentenced - he had only
             received telephone calls and warning letters so in  any  event
             would not be on a blacklist even if such a thing existed.

          d) The possibility of him coming to the adverse attention of  the
             Taliban as a target was so remote given the practicalities  of
             such a process - as referred to in �180 to �185 of AS.

          e) Up to date information which is not referenced by Dr Giustozzi
             in his report, indicates that although police protection isn't
             very good, it is improving.

     20. Ms Isherwood took issue with what she  said  was  Mr  Bandegani'  s
         submission that the respondent had, in his policy  documents,  made
         concessions. She referred to the use  of  the  word  "may"  in  the
         policy documents and that all the country material relied upon said
         that the contents were for  guidance  only  which,  she  submitted,
         indicated that each case had to be considered on its own facts  and
         within its own factual matrix. I did not detect any real difference
         between Mr Bandegani and Ms Isherwood. Mr Bandegani was not,  as  I
         understood  him  to  submit,  saying  that  the  sections  of   the
         respondent's policy documents and  guidance  which  were  pre-fixed
         with the word "may' indicated a concession  that  individuals  that
         fell  within  those  specific  groups  were  to  be  recognised  as
         refugees; merely that they fell within a category  of  persons  who
         may, depending on all the circumstances, be refugees.  Ms Isherwood
         did not dispute that the respondent was bound to follow his policy.



     21. At one-point Ms Isherwood appeared to be saying that  the  position
         of the appellant was more closely equated with  an  off-duty  truck
         driver rather than a contractor/subcontractor, because he drove his
         own delivery vehicles. She did not pursue this but  said  that  the
         appellant was not in the  same  position  as  an  interpreter.  She
         referred to the EASO Report that  individuals  undertaking  general
         maintenance work were not "systematically targeted although attacks
         occur".  In  her  skeleton  and  oral  submissions   Ms   Isherwood
         acknowledged that the words high profile and low profile  were  not
         particularly helpful; what was required was a careful look  at  the
         individual circumstances. She submitted  that  in  this  case,  the
         appellant was not of such a profile as to result in  him  being  at
         risk;  there  was  no  indication  of  his  visibility,  he  was  a
         contractor and not  on  the  payroll,  his  family  have  not  been
         banished, he has not been sentenced, there  is  an  improvement  in
         policing and protection, there is no evidence that having  been  in
         the West for four years that increases his risk and he is a  single
         healthy young man returning  to  Afghanistan  with  skills  he  can
         utilise.

     22. Mr Bandegani disputed that AS had not  been  sentenced.  The  third
         letter from the Taliban refers to him being  treated  according  to
         Sharia law. He drew  attention  to  the  specific  elements  in  Dr
         Giustozzi' s report which addressed AS CG and the lack  of  sources
         and corroboration. He drew my attention to the policy and  guidance
         document issued by  the  respondent  and  to  the  UNHCR  and  EASO
         reports.

     23. On 6th December 2018 I made the following directions:

               1. The hearing of this appeal took  place  on  29th  November
                  2018, the appeal having been remitted back  to  the  Upper
                  Tribunal for determination.

               2. In considering the documents and submissions made,  it  is
                  not clear to me whether

                   a) The respondent accepts that the appellant is at  real
                      risk of being persecuted  in  his  home  province  of
                      Laghman and the issue is thus an  issue  of  internal
                      relocation and sufficiency of protection in Kabul; or

                   b) The respondent does not accept the  appellant  is  at
                      real risk of being persecuted in Laghman.

               3. This matter is therefore to be listed for 1 � hours on the
                  first available date before Upper Tribunal Judge Coker for
                  this to be clarified.

               4. Alternatively, if the parties are able  to  agree  whether
                  the appeal falls within 2(a) or 2(b) above,  they  are  to
                  notify the Tribunal within  14  days  of  the  date  these
                  directions are sent to avoid a hearing. In the event  that
                  there is no agreement,  the  parties  are  to  notify  the
                  Tribunal (no later than  14  days  after  the  date  these
                  directions are sent) of their availability during  January
                  and February 2019. The Tribunal will endeavour to list the
                  hearing at the convenience of the parties.

     24. In an email sent on 20th December 2018, Ms Isherwood on  behalf  of
         the respondent said:

             "The SSHD has considered the directions dated 10 December  and
             whether it is accepted that the appellant would be at risk  if
             he is returned to Laghman.

             It is the SSHD position that because of the  individual  facts
             of the case which  have  been  sustained  and  the  background
             evidence indicating that the Taliban does have  some  presence
             in different  areas  of  Laghman.  It  is  accepted  that  the
             appellant would be at risk if returned to Laghman and Kabul is
             to be considered for internal relocation  and  sufficiency  of
             protection."

         Discussion

     25. It is correct that the Afghan State has taken measures  to  attempt
         to improve its law enforcement and justice system (see for  example
         the June 2018 EASO report) but the systems remain weak  and  cannot
         provide sufficiency of protection for individuals at real  risk  of
         being persecuted.

     26. AS falls, I  am  satisfied,  within  the  category  of  individuals
         perceived to  have  collaborated  with  and  been  associated  with
         foreign troops present in Afghanistan. The undisputed  findings  of
         the First-tier Tribunal make it plain that  this  appellant  is  at
         real risk of being targeted by the Taliban in his home area and has
         been targeted by them and has been sentenced under Shariah law.

     27. As I understand Ms Isherwood's submissions, the  respondent  is  of
         the view that the appellant would be  able  to  relocate  to  Kabul
         because he would not be at risk of being traced and thus  a  target
         there. I note the evidence in his supplementary  witness  statement
         which although the subject  of  a  submission  that  little  weight
         should be placed upon it, was not challenged in cross examination.

     28. As succinctly put in the EASO report, the "reach  of  an  insurgent
         group depends on its power  position,  including  its  networks  or
         other co-operation mechanisms. For example, the Taliban are  mostly
         present in rural areas, it is also reported that they run a network
         of informants and conduct intelligence  gathering  in  the  cities.
         Information suggests that they will persecute  certain  individuals
         even  in  major  cities,  depending  on  their  profile  and  their
         individual circumstances."

     29. AS CG declined to make findings or give guidance on what  could  be
         described as wider risk categories because of a  lack  of  evidence
         before it. Although  Mr  Bandegani  submitted  that  those  in  the
         position of the appellant should be included as  being  in  a  risk
         category covered by AS CG, it is not necessary in this decision  to
         reach a decision on whether the specified risk categories should be
         expanded and if so how - the respondent accepts that this appeal is
         concerned with the question of internal relocation to Kabul for  AS
         given that he is at real risk  of  being  persecuted  in  his  home
         province. The issue of whether  internal  relocation  is  a  viable
         option for the appellant is a matter  of  fact,  personal  to  this
         appellant. That AS  CG  refers,  in  the  first  paragraph  of  the
         guidance, to those of lower  level  interest,  that  assessment  is
         always going to be informed the particular  characteristics  of  an
         applicant for asylum. In this case the appellant is accepted to  be
         at real risk of being persecuted in his home  province  because  he
         either was or was perceived to be a collaborator with  the  foreign
         forces. That perception continued after he had  ceased  undertaking
         any work and culminated in a death threat.

     30. The appellant's family live in Kabul. The appellant does not submit
         that they are either at risk of  or  are  being  persecuted  for  a
         Convention reason. The  appellant  received  threatening  telephone
         calls when he was in Kabul, prior  to  coming  to  the  UK.  It  is
         reasonable to conclude that the Taliban,  or  a  network  or  group
         associated with the Taliban, were aware of his presence  in  Kabul.
         His family moved from Kabul after the appellant had left the  city.
         They have now returned there. There is no reason, given the overall
         credibility  of  the  appellant's   account   and   the   appellant
         personally, to doubt the appellant's account that his  family  have
         told him that they have been visited by  elements  of  the  Taliban
         demanding to know his whereabouts. I accept  that  evidence  to  be
         correct. That is not to say that the guidance in  AS  CG  regarding
         blacklists is no longer operative. That is not the issue before me.
         The particular evidence and factual matrix for  this  appellant  is
         that his family have been identified as being in Kabul,  that  when
         he was there he was identified as being there and if he returns  to
         his family in Kabul there is every likelihood that he will again be
         identified as being there.

     31. It is simply not going to be possible to prevent it becoming  known
         that a son has returned to his family, unless he went straight into
         hiding which is unreasonable.

     32. This appellant is a single young man of reasonable  health  and  he
         has contacts and support mechanism available to him in Kabul -  his
         family. Yet the Taliban have reached his family and identified that
         the appellant is  not  there.  They  have  not  desisted  in  their
         harassment of the appellant's family.  There  is  every  reason  to
         suppose that if the appellant returns to Kabul, his return  to  the
         family home would be remarked upon and knowledge  of  his  presence
         would, with little difficulty, end up in the hands of insurgents.

     33. When he was last in Kabul he received threatening telephone  calls,
         albeit that was some five years or more ago; although the  interest
         in the appellant had increased over time.

     34. The Country Policy and Information note December 2016 refers  to  a
         Canadian IRB report which considers the ability of the  Taliban  to
         uncover individuals' whereabouts not only in rural areas  but  also
         in Kabul. AS CG had this document before them, but as I  have  said
         earlier, for this appellant  there  is  no  doubt  that  if  he  is
         identified as having returned to Kabul, then he will be at risk.

     35. The question then arises whether he could live elsewhere in  Kabul.
         If it were not for the fact that he has been  previously  targeted,
         and his family receive visits and are harassed, that might well  be
         a viable possibility, in accordance with the guidance of AS CG. But
         the nature of Afghani society, the  questions  that  are  asked  of
         individuals who arrive in a  neighbourhood  as  documented  in  the
         various reports relied upon, and that in this  case  the  appellant
         speaks fluent English would all lead to a more intense enquiry from
         those he met. I am satisfied  that  in  his  case  because  of  his
         personal background and circumstances, that he would be found.

     36. This risk is a risk that amounts to it being unduly harsh  for  him
         to relocate, if not meeting the threshold of persecution. Although,
         as submitted by Ms Isherwood the level of  policing  is  improving,
         there was simply inadequate evidence to show that although the will
         might be there, an individual in this  appellant's  position  could
         even begin to access protection.

     37. For the reasons I have set out  above,  I  am  satisfied  that  the
         appellant is at serious risk of being persecuted for  a  Convention
         reason if removed to Afghanistan, that internal relocation would be
         unduly harsh and there is a lack of sufficiency of protection.

    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

    I set aside the decision, findings of fact preserved.

    I allow the appeal against the  respondent's  decision  to  refuse  the
    appellant's protection claim.
