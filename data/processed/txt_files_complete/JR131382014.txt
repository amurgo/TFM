Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Kalim
For the Respondent:    Mr Z Malik







                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The applicant is a national of Bangladesh. He  entered  the  UK  on  11
    February 2010 with  entry  clearance  and  leave  to  remain  until  31
    December 2012. He made an application on 28 December 2012  for  further
    leave to remain. That application was refused on 5 March  2013  with  a
    right of appeal which the applicant exercised. His appeal was dismissed
    on 4 September 2013 leaving him appeal rights exhausted on  16  October
    2013.

 2. On the 24 October 2013 the applicant made  a  further  application  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student which was supported by  a
    TOEIC certificate which had been obtained following  the  taking  of  a
    test conducted by ETS over two separate days on the 20th  and  22  June
    2012 at one of their testing centres, the details for which are set out
    below. This application  was  granted  on  10  January  2014,  and  the
    applicant was granted leave to remain until  7  March  2015.  Following
    this, on 30 September  2014,  the  respondent  made  a  decision  under
    section 10 of the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  1999  to  remove  the
    applicant on the basis  that  the  TOEIC  certificate  which  had  been
    provided following the test set out above was fraudulent. That decision
    is the subject of  this  judicial  review.  In  short,  permission  was
    initially refused to apply  for  judicial  review,  but  following  the
    consideration of an appeal by the Court of Appeal permission to  appeal
    was granted, the appeal was allowed, permission to apply  for  judicial
    review was granted, and the matter was remitted to the  Upper  Tribunal
    for this substantive hearing.

 3. During the currency of these judicial review proceedings the  applicant
    made a human  rights  claim  based  upon  his  marriage  to  a  British
    national. That application was refused on 15 July 2016.  The  applicant
    appealed that decision to the  First  Tier  Tribunal,  and  his  appeal
    succeeded, following which the respondent granted the  applicant  leave
    to remain until 20 August 2020. Of note in relation to that  appeal  is
    that the Judge of the First Tier Tribunal noted at paragraph 4  of  his
    determination (promulgated on 19 December 2017) that the applicant  had
    had his leave curtailed as a result of having obtained it by  deception
    as set out above. It does not appear that this point was relied upon by
    the respondent in relation to that appeal as a basis for resisting  it.
    The judge of the First Tier Tribunal heard evidence from the  applicant
    and his wife, and determined on  the  basis  of  well-known  article  8
    principles that it would be unjustifiably harsh to refuse  the  appeal,
    in circumstances where the appellant's article 8 rights  were  engaged.
    The existence of this appeal, the success of the appeal, the fact  that
    the applicant gave evidence to  the hearing without the  assistance  of
    an interpreter, and the failure of the respondent to take any point  in
    the appeal in respect of the present decision, were all  matters  which
    featured in due course in the submissions in respect of  this  judicial
    review.

 4. Both the applicant and the respondent accepted that it  was  necessary,
    albeit unusual in judicial review proceedings, for the  Upper  Tribunal
    to assess as a question of precedent fact the issue of whether  or  not
    leave had  been  fraudulently  obtained  by  virtue  of  the  applicant
    exercising deception, in that he was not the person who  undertook  the
    ETS test and therefore the TOEIC certificate had been obtained  by  the
    use of fraud. The staged approach which it  is  necessary  to  take  in
    assessing this question is set out in greater  detail  below.  At  this
    stage it is necessary to set out the evidence which the applicant  gave
    in support of his case.

 5. The applicant provided a witness statement  which  he  adopted  as  his
    evidence-in-chief.  In  that  witness  statement  he   sets   out   the
    immigration history which is recorded above. He  robustly  rejects  the
    allegation that he cheated in order to gain his TOEIC  certificate.  In
    his witness statement he points out that prior to coming to the UK  his
    school certificates demonstrate that he had a good command  of  English
    and, in 2008, he scored  an  A  in  English  in  his  Higher  Secondary
    Certificate examination. His documents from school  show  that  he  had
    been studying English since 2005. In addition, in 2011,  the  applicant
    had undertaken a test of his English language abilities  in  accordance
    with the International  English  Language  Testing  System.  This  test
    showed him scoring an overall score of 5.5, together  with  a  speaking
    ability of 6.0 and reading and writing abilities of 5.0. In  subsequent
    submissions Mr Karim illustrated that these scores were equivalent to a
    score of Bl to B2 in respect  of  the  Common  European  Framework  for
    describing language ability. This in turn correlates to between 120 and
    150 or 160 points under the TOEIC scoring system.

 6. The applicant describes taking the TOEIC test at the Queensway  College
    in Walthamstow in June 2012. He says in the witness statement that this
    venue was within walking distance of a friend's house, and that he paid
    between �120 and �140 for  the  test,  attending  the  college  on  two
    separate dates. The test was held, he recalls, on the ground floor  and
    there were around 8 to 10 people also taking the  test.  The  applicant
    explains that he has an established family and private life in  the  UK
    and no longer has any meaningful ties  to  Bangladesh  as  all  of  his
    friends and family are in the UK. He contends that he had no reason  or
    motive to engage a proxy to take the test for him and cheat in order to
    obtain a satisfactory English language certificate.

 7. The applicant was cross-examined by Mr Malik who appeared on behalf  of
    the respondent. The applicant explained that he originally came to  the
    UK in order to study for a Travel and Tourism management diploma.  This
    course was  at  the  Icon  College  of  Technology  and  Management  in
    Whitechapel. The applicant had studied English at first, but then moved
    to a different college to undertake a different course. He  changed  to
    the Opal College in London in September 2010,  but  did  not  tell  the
    respondent that he had changed  course  as  he  did  not  know  he  was
    supposed to do so. At Opal college he undertook a Diploma  in  Business
    Management which lasted for two years and was a level 5 BTEC course. On
    28 December 2012 he had applied for entry clearance for a level 6  BTEC
    diploma course at  another  college  whose  name  he  could  no  longer
    remember. That application was refused. He did not study from  December
    2012 until October 2013 as he had  no  permission  to  do  so,  and  no
    college would accept him without  an  appropriate  visa  clearance.  In
    October 2013 he again applied for an extended level 6 BTEC  diploma  at
    the European College for Higher Education, and he finished  the  course
    in that college although there was no certificate to that effect in the
    bundle he had confirmed the completion of the course in paragraph 13 of
    his witness statement. Subsequently, a copy of the Level 6 Diploma  was
    produced, albeit subject to objection from Mr Malik on the  basis  that
    it was produced late and was not an original.

 8. The applicant explained that he had been living in Kingston at the time
    when he took the test in June 2012. As set out above  he  had  obtained
    5.0 in some categories in his IELTS test in 2011, but he explained that
    he needed 5.5 in each category in order to  have  a  satisfactory  test
    result. He was unable to recall the address of the Queensway College in
    Walthamstow, and he explained that he had not memorised it and  it  was
    now eight years ago or  thereabouts.  His  student  counsellor  at  his
    college in East London had suggested three  potential  testing  centres
    and he had chosen Queensway College because he had a friend  who  lived
    near it whose name was Mr Bhujian. He could not  recall  this  person's
    address or the street name where  he  lived,  but  he  had  picked  the
    applicant up from the station and taken him to the test centre, and the
    applicant had attended his house after the test. When  questioned,  the
    applicant explained that Mr Bhujian now resided in America and  he  was
    no longer in touch with him other than by Facebook. He had not told him
    about the case because he was ashamed to do so. He  explained  that  he
    had booked the test and registered a few days  prior  to  it  with  the
    receptionist at the Queensway College and on the  test  day  had  taken
    himself there and paid �l00 to �140  in  cash.  He  had  been  given  a
    receipt, but he had not kept it as he didn't think he needed to do  so.
    In all he attended Queensway College four times, once for registration,
    twice for the purposes of the test and then  finally  to  pick  up  his
    certificate. When he attended the test on 20 June 2012 there were 8  to
    10 people seated in the room. There were other rooms with other  people
    in them. During the test he had to read a text and had  to  describe  a
    picture. He did not see staff handing out answers to  other  candidates
    at the college.

 9. He was asked about a witness statement which  he  had  provided  on  22
    August 2014 dealing with the concerns which had been raised in relation
    to the testing certificate. It was pointed out to him by Mr Malik  that
    at paragraph 8 he had not mentioned attending the test on 22 June  2012
    but only 20 June 2012.  He  explained  in  response  that  it  was  the
    speaking test which was being relied upon. He  had  not  mentioned  the
    involvement of his friend in that statement  because  it  was  a  small
    matter and not central to the issues involved.

10. The applicant was asked whether  or  not  he  had  contacted  Queensway
    College after the decision and he explained that he had  not  done  so,
    principally because he was fighting for an in-country right of  appeal.
    He was also asked whether he had  contacted  ETS  in  relation  to  the
    disputed test result and he explained that he had  not  contacted  them
    either, again on the basis that he was fighting for an in-country right
    of appeal. The applicant said that he had not been told  by  anyone  to
    contact ETS,  and  in  particular  when  questioned  on  the  point  he
    indicated that he had not been told to get hold of  the  recordings  of
    his test, and that he was not aware that he could do  so.  He  insisted
    that he had sat the test and was unaware that a proxy could  have  done
    so. He explained that he had taken photo  identification  to  the  test
    process.

11. Mr Malik questioned the applicant about the test results which  he  had
    obtained in June 2012, noting in particular that in the June 2012  test
    which was in question he had achieved a perfect score  in  relation  to
    speaking, and had scored 190 out of 200  in  relation  to  writing.  Mr
    Malik asked the applicant to contrast those results with those which he
    had achieved the previous year set out above. The  applicant  explained
    that in his view his English  language  ability  had  improved  in  the
    intervening period as a  result  of  study  and  working  hard  on  his
    language skills and that this explained the improvement in  his  scores
    which were evident from the 2012 test result.

12. The respondent's conclusion that the applicant's English language  test
    result from June 2012  had  been  obtained  fraudulently  is  initially
    substantiated by the respondent's reliance upon generic  evidence  from
    Ms  Rebecca  Collings  and  Mr  Peter  Millington  who   describe   the
    investigations which were undertaken in respect  of  ETS  test  results
    following  an  investigation  by  a  television  programme   disclosing
    widespread abuse in respect of English language tests undertaken at  UK
    test centres administered by ETS. ETS were a test provider who operated
    and administered the TOEIC test at a number of UK testing centres.  The
    respondent's investigations led to a detailed  examination  by  ETS  in
    relation to the validity of test results  through  the  examination  of
    electronic recordings of the tests which had been taken deploying voice
    recognition software as well as human  analysts  to  detect  fraud.  In
    addition to this material other generic evidence commonly  deployed  by
    the respondent in cases  involving  ETS  English  language  test  fraud
    includes reports from Prof French, Prof  Harrison  and  Kroll  Ontrack,
    which were  also  relied  upon  in  the  present  case.  This  material
    underpins a document known as the  ETS  Look  Up  Tool,  which  in  the
    present case establishes that the applicants TOEIC certificate has been
    invalidated by ETS following their investigations.

13. In addition to the generic evidence the respondent also relies  upon  a
    report compiled specifically in  respect  of  Queensway  College  dated
    January 2017. The conclusions of that report were that the majority  of
    tests undertaken at Queensway College were not conducted under  genuine
    test conditions and were not a true reflection of the English  language
    ability of the candidates who undertook the  tests.  Indeed,  following
    the ETS voice analysis in relation to the speaking element of the test,
    it was determined that 71% of the speaking results were  invalid  "i.e.
    the results were obtained via the use  of  a  proxy  test  taker".  The
    report noted that proxy test takers were identified in 259 of  the  283
    speaking and writing test sessions which the authors took as indicating
    that abuse was widespread and occurred  throughout  the  entire  period
    that  Queensway  College  were  offering   these   tests.   The   score
    distribution for speaking, writing, listening and reading all  deviated
    significantly from the  results  observed  by  Pearson  at  their  test
    centres, but correlated with the distribution of  scores  within  other
    ETS test centres where abuse had been identified. This  report  led  Mr
    Malik to characterise Queensway College as a "fraud factory" in respect
    of the delivery of English language testing.

14. Given the history of this litigation, and in particular the terms  upon
    which it was remitted to the Upper Tribunal by  the  Court  of  Appeal,
    there is a consensus  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  should  consider  and
    determine this judicial review notwithstanding that  an  out-of-country
    appeal right exists in relation to the removal  decision  made  by  the
    respondent pursuant to section 10  of  the  1999  Act.  The  issues  in
    relation to  ETS  English  language  training  have  given  rise  to  a
    significant volume of litigation. The approach to be taken  in  respect
    of the evaluation of the question of  precedent  fact  in  relation  to
    whether or not deception was used in the taking of an English  language
    test in order to obtain immigration status is now well settled  in  the
    light of the following authorities: SM and Qadir v SSHD  (ETS-Evidence-
    Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229; SSHD v Shehzad and  Chowdhury  [2016]
    EWCA Civ 615; Majumber and Qadir [2016] EWCA Civ 1167 and R  (Abbas)  v
    SSHD [2017] EWHC 78. The first step to be considered is whether or  not
    sufficient evidence has been adduced by the  respondent  to  raise  the
    issue of fraud in relation to the TOEIC  certificate.  The  authorities
    illustrate, and it is agreed in the present case, that  the  production
    of both the generic evidence and also the ETS Look Up Tool  identifying
    the applicants test  as  having  been  invalidated,  is  sufficient  to
    discharge this first step in the evidential analysis. The second  stage
    is to seek to establish whether or not  the  applicant  has  raised  an
    innocent explanation which satisfies a minimum level of plausibility so
    as to discharge the burden placed upon him by the satisfaction  of  the
    first stage in the evidential analysis. Again, in the present  case  it
    is agreed that the applicant has raised, through his  evidence  to  the
    Tribunal, sufficient evidence of  an  innocent  explanation  so  as  to
    discharge  the  burden  placed  upon  him  at  this  second  stage   of
    consideration. The third stage is the examination of whether or not the
    respondent has established on the balance  of  probabilities  that  the
    applicant's explanation can properly be rejected. It is this third  and
    final stage of the analysis  which  is  determinative  of  the  present
    application for judicial  review,  and  which  was  the  focus  of  the
    assessment and submissions made at the hearing.

15. It is clear from the authorities that the assessment of the evidence in
    ETS test cases will be "an intensely fact-specific matter" (per Shehzad
    and Chowdhury, paragraph 23). In Majumber and Qadir, at  paragraph  18,
    Beatson LJ observed that the Upper Tribunal had correctly  included  as
    relevant factors in assessing the allegation of dishonesty  in  an  ETS
    test case "what the applicant had to lose;  what  is  known  about  his
    character; the cultural environment  in  which  he  operated;  how  the
    individual accused of dishonesty performed under cross-examination, and
    whether the tribunal's assessment of  that  person's  English  language
    proficiency is commensurate with his or her TOEIC scores;  and  whether
    his or her academic achievements are such that it  was  unnecessary  or
    illogical for them to have cheated." In relation to the approach to  be
    taken to the factual evidence  in  the  present  case,  Mr  Malik  drew
    particular attention that to the observations of Underhill  LJ  in  the
    case of Ahsan and others v SSHD  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  2009  when,  having
    reviewed a number of authorities dealing with ETS test cases (including
    those cited above) he stated as follows:

         "[W]here the impugned  test  was  taken  at  an  established  fraud
         factory such as Elizabeth College, and also  where  the  voice-file
         does not record the applicant's voice (or no attempt has been  made
         to obtain it), the case that he or she  cheated  will  be  hard  to
         resist. We were not  ourselves  taken  to  any  of  the  underlying
         evidence, but I am willing to accept that  that  appears  to  be  a
         reasonable summary of the effect of the recent decisions  to  which
         we were referred. However, I am not prepared to accept - and  I  do
         not in fact understand Ms Giovanetti to have been contending - that
         even in such specially strong cases the  abs  observations  in  the
         earlier  case-law  to  the  effect  that  a  decision  whether  the
         applicant or appellant has cheated is fact-specific are  no  longer
         applicable or that there is no  prospect  of  their  oral  evidence
         affecting the outcome."

16. In his submissions on behalf of  the  respondent,  Mr  Malik  made  the
    following points in support of the submission that the  respondent  had
    discharged  the  burden  placed  upon  her  at  the  third   stage   of
    consideration of the evidence. Firstly, he submitted that  the  use  of
    the Look Up Tool demonstrated that the chance of the result being false
    was less than 1%. In the case of  Abbas  it  was  accepted  by  William
    Davies J that the effect of the generic  evidence  of,  in  particular,
    Prof French was that the number  of  false  positives  in  the  overall
    number of results was likely to be less than 1% on  the  basis  of  the
    analysis that had been undertaken. Secondly, Mr  Malik  submitted  that
    Queensway College was a fraud factory for the reasons  set  out  above.
    Thirdly, Mr Malik submitted that it was common knowledge that a  person
    in the position of the applicant could obtain his voice recording  from
    ETS in order to establish beyond doubt that it was him  who  had  taken
    the test. In this connection, Mr Malik  relied  upon  paragraph  33  of
    Ahsan as set out above, and in particular the observation that  a  case
    would be hard to resist where a person had not  sought  to  obtain  his
    voice recording from ETS  leading  to  the  drawing  of  an  inevitable
    inference that the applicant knew that were he to do so it would expose
    his fraud. Again, in Abbas at paragraph  24  William  Davies  J  placed
    reliance on the failure of that claimant to obtain the voice recording,
    and pointed out that it would be of little assistance to the respondent
    to obtain the recording but of critical significance to an applicant or
    claimant in supporting his or her case. Fourthly, Mr Malik relied  upon
    the payment of cash for the fee. In Abbas at paragraph 21 the court had
    concluded that the payment  of  cash,  whilst  not  in  and  of  itself
    determinative of a fraudulent transaction, was, nonetheless, consistent
    with criminality. Finally, Mr Malik drew attention to the  observations
    of the Upper Tribunal in MA at paragraph 57, where it was  pointed  out
    that there may be a range of reasons why a person  might  engage  in  a
    fraudulent English  language  test,  such  reasons  including  lack  of
    confidence, fear of failure, lack of time and commitment  and  contempt
    for the immigration system. The Upper Tribunal noted that  it  was  not
    necessary to make a finding of  why  the  appellant  or  applicant  had
    engaged  in  deception,  but  it  sufficed  to  note  that  there  were
    alternative reasons why fraud might be engaged in respect of an English
    language test even by a person who was otherwise proficient in English.

17. Mr Malik made a  number  of  submissions  based  upon  the  applicant's
    evidence. He submitted that it was of relevance that the applicant  had
    failed to inform the respondent  of  his  change  of  college.  In  his
    statement of 22 August 2014 the applicant had not set out that  he  had
    pursued a course of study at  Opal  College;  moreover,  there  was  no
    evidence of his study for the Level 6 Diploma set out above.  Mr  Malik
    submitted that the  applicant  had  provided  no  credible  reason  for
    picking Queensway College as the place where he was going to  take  his
    test, and that he had omitted from his witness statement the number  of
    times he had attended the test centre. Mr Malik relied upon the absence
    of any evidence from his friend, and indeed submitted that  his  friend
    did not exist. Whereas the applicant had said that 8 to 10  people  had
    taken the test at that test centre that day, the evidence from ETS  was
    that 45 tests had been taken that day and they had all  been  cancelled
    following the investigations as either  invalid  or  questionable.  The
    applicant had failed to provide the address or even the street name  of
    either the college or his friend in his evidence.  Mr  Malik  submitted
    that far greater particularity would be required before  the  applicant
    could be regarded as a credible witness. Finally, he submitted that  it
    was wholly lacking credibility for the applicant to have  improved  his
    English language skills from a level of Bl  in  2011,  amounting  to  a
    score of 120 to 149, to a level of 190 just over a year later. In short
    Mr Malik submitted that  the  respondent  had  clearly  discharged  the
    burden of proof in the present case.

18. In his submissions Mr Karim submitted that the matters  raised  by  the
    respondent ought to have been relied upon  in  the  appeal  before  the
    First  Tier  Tribunal  in  relation  to  the  applicant's   article   8
    application. Instead, in the context of that decision,  the  respondent
    accepted that the applicant satisfied the suitability  requirements  in
    terms. In the witness statement that the applicant had produced for the
    purposes of the appeal before the First Tier Tribunal the applicant had
    dealt with the issue of the decision to remove him, but this had simply
    not been pursued by the respondent at that time when it ought  to  have
    been.

19. Mr Karim relied upon a report  of  the  All-Party  Parliamentary  Group
    ("the Group") on TOEIC which was completed on 18 July  2019.  Mr  Karim
    noted that this Group had received evidence from  Prof  French  and  Dr
    Harrison during the course of their hearings in June 2019. In their Key
    Findings the Group noted that all of the experts from whom  they  heard
    agreed  that  the  respondents  generic  evidence   was   questionable.
    Moreover, they noted  that  Prof  French  gave  evidence  that  he  was
    included in a meeting in August 2014  convened  by  the  respondent  at
    which the experts present had requested more information  in  order  to
    reliably assess the generic evidence, but in fact Prof French had heard
    nothing  further  from  the  respondent  following  the  meeting  until
    February 2016. In his evidence to the Group, Prof French indicated that
    caution should be exercised in using his conclusions to argue that  any
    particular student cheated in the  light  of  his  concern  as  to  the
    reliability of the results given to the respondent  by  ETS.  Mr  Karim
    noted the observations made by the Group in relation  to  the  Look  Up
    Tool, and in that connection to attention  to  the  fact  that  in  the
    present case the Look Up Tool records the  applicant's  nationality  as
    being UK. To Karim further noted the evidence that the  Group  received
    about the lack of continuity evidence in relation to the voice files.

20. Mr Karim submitted that the applicant had been  an  impressive  witness
    without inconsistencies or exaggerations in his evidence. None  of  the
    suggested omissions alluded to by Mr  Malik  were  matters  which  were
    central to his account. It stood to the applicant's credit that he  had
    continued to pursue this judicial review notwithstanding that he  could
    have awaited August 2020 or thereabouts to raise the  issues  contained
    in this application. At the time when the applicant took  his  test  in
    June 2012 the expiration of his leave was  not  imminent,  and  he  had
    plenty of time to take the test and no need or incentive  to  engage  a
    proxy to take it for him. It was not lacking in  credibility  that  his
    English could have improved in between the testing  in  2011  and  that
    testing of it in dispute. Mr Karim submitted that Mr  Malik's  reliance
    upon the absence from the statement  of  22  August  2014  of  the  two
    occasions on which the  test  was  taken  was  simply  nit-picking,  in
    particular  in  circumstances  where  in  earlier   documentation   the
    applicant had specifically recorded the two days upon which he had  sat
    the test as part of his case. Mr Karim submitted it simply  lacked  any
    credibility to suggest, as the respondent did, that all  of  the  tests
    which were undertaken on the dates in question at the Queensway College
    were fraudulent and this, he submitted, cast significant doubt over the
    credibility of the respondent's evidence. In respect of  the  applicant
    not having obtained the voice recording he submitted that there was  no
    continuity evidence which could provide securely for the production  of
    the correct recording of the applicant's test. The description that the
    applicant had given of the test which he undertook matched that in  the
    literature provided in the TOEIC User Guide, reinforcing the realism of
    the applicants evidence.  In  the  circumstances,  the  respondent  had
    failed to discharge the burden of proof in this case.

21. Further post-hearing submissions were made in writing by  both  parties
    which I have taken into account in making my decision.

22. As set out above, it is accepted that the generic evidence provided  by
    the respondent in this case, alongside the Look  Up  Tool  invalidating
    the applicants test result, suffices to establish the issue of fraud in
    relation to the test certificate requiring  the  applicant  to  provide
    plausible evidence of an innocent explanation. I am  unable  to  accept
    that the simple error in relation to the nationality of  the  applicant
    is sufficient to preclude the respondent relying upon the Look Up Tool:
    it is an administrative error of little if any moment in the evaluation
    of the material. As a consequence of the evidence which  the  applicant
    provided at the hearing it was conceded on  behalf  of  the  respondent
    that the applicant had discharged this burden.  The  issue  which  then
    arises is as to whether  or  not  the  respondent  has  discharged  the
    subsequent  burden  upon  her  of  demonstrating  on  the  balance   of
    probabilities that the applicants explanation should be  rejected.  The
    reasons for my conclusion in respect of that issue are as follows.

23. The starting point  must  be  my  observations  about  the  applicant's
    evidence, bearing in mind that the conclusions in a case of  this  kind
    will inevitably be highly fact-sensitive, and bespoke only to the  case
    which is under consideration and the particular  circumstances  of  the
    applicant being evaluated. The first  point  to  observe  is  that  the
    applicant gave his evidence in fluent  English  without  any  need  for
    interpretation. He  presented  as  a  competent  English  speaker.  His
    account was consistent, and I do not set much store by the points  made
    by Mr Malik in relation to matters which  may  have  been  absent  from
    earlier statements, such as whether he took the test on one day or  two
    (particularly  bearing  in  mind  earlier  documentation  in  which  he
    mentioned both dates). There is some substance in the points raised  by
    Mr Malik in respect of absence of detail from the applicant's  account.
    As he observed, there were details provided  in  the  applicant's  oral
    evidence about, for instance, the  number  of  times  that  he  visited
    Queensway College and other  gaps  in  the  evidence  for  instance  in
    relation to the street names for either the college or his friend which
    were surprising.  In  my  view,  there  were  other  more  particularly
    troubling aspects of  the  applicant's  evidence.  In  particular,  the
    applicant was unable to provide any explanation as to why  he  had  not
    contacted either Queensway College immediately  upon  the  decision  to
    remove him having be made or, perhaps  more  pertinently,  why  he  had
    failed thereafter to make any attempt to contact  ETS,  or  obtain  the
    recording of his test, in order to establish with clarity that  he  was
    the person who had taken it. This is a feature I shall return to below.

24. The significance of  the  relatively  small  proportion  of  inaccurate
    results in relation to  invalidity  found  in  the  case  of  Abbas  is
    difficult to ignore. There is also considerable force in the contention
    made by Mr Malik that the results from  Queensway  College  demonstrate
    that it was a fraud factory, in which there was  substantial  abuse  of
    the testing regime. I am  satisfied  on  the  evidence  that  Queensway
    College was a fraud factory. Similarly, and  although  the  subject  of
    dispute and contention after the hearing, the findings of the All-Party
    Parliamentary Group and the record of the evidence which they  received
    from, for instance, Prof French, questioning  the  reliability  of  the
    generic evidence cannot be overlooked. The evaluation  of  the  generic
    material and the Group's report is not straightforward, but  doing  the
    best that I can it appears that the evidence which the  Group  received
    potentially diminishes  the  weight  to  be  attached  to  the  generic
    material on the basis that it appears to raise issues which have yet to
    be forensically explored and definitively concluded upon. Thus, all  of
    these factors have to be placed into the balance in  assessing  whether
    or not the respondent has discharged the burden upon her.

25. I am unable to accept any contention that the conclusions of the  First
    Tier Tribunal, or the failure of the respondent to take  any  point  in
    that appeal in respect of the reasons for the removal decision  in  the
    applicant's case prevent the respondent from raising these  matters  or
    sustaining them in the context of this judicial  review.  As  Mr  Malik
    rightly points out they do not give  rise  to  any  issue  estoppel  or
    similar obstacle to the respondent relying upon  them  in  the  present
    proceedings. Nonetheless, the fact that the respondent  in  reaching  a
    decision in respect of the applicant's human rights  application  found
    him to be able to satisfy the requirements of suitability is a relevant
    consideration in the present case which needs to be taken into account.
    That said, it is not a matter to which I attach very significant weight
    in making the decision in the present case.

26. My overall conclusion in relation to the issues in this application are
    as follows. The assessment must commence from the observation that  the
    respondent has  demonstrated  on  any  view  both  that  there  were  a
    significant number of false tests identified by ETS  at  the  Queensway
    College and that the applicant's was identified in  the  investigations
    undertaken  following  the  discovery  of  issues  with   the   testing
    undertaken by ETS as being amongst that number.  Whilst  further  doubt
    has been cast over the reliability  of  that  material  in  the  recent
    report by the All-Party Parliamentary Group, in my view it is difficult
    to conclude other than on the balance  of  probabilities  there  was  a
    significant amount  of  cheating  being  undertaken  at  the  Queensway
    College and that it was a location at which proxy tests were occurring:
    it was a fraud factory. Whilst I am able to place some weight upon  the
    evidence of the applicant on the basis that in  many  respects  it  was
    coherent  and  given  in  fluent  English,  that  weight  has   to   be
    significantly tempered in my judgement  by  the  significant  omissions
    from it and, in particular, by the failure of  the  applicant  to  have
    taken any steps to obtain from the archive the electronic recording  of
    his test. As Mr Malik, observed the failure to do so gives  rise  to  a
    clear and weighty inference that the reluctance to do so  is  based  OQ
    the concern that it might prove the respondent's case beyond doubt.  In
    my view, the suggestion from Mr Karim that the continuity evidence  did
    not exist to establish whether any test recording was in fact  that  of
    the applicant was a  speculative  and  unsubstantiated  submission:  in
    truth this is a completely untested hypothesis. I have therefore formed
    the view that the applicant's evidence  contains  material  gaps  which
    undermine the reliance which can be placed upon it when evaluating  the
    evidence as a whole.

27. I have considered the other contextual issues which have been raised by
    the  applicant  and  the  respondent  during  the   course   of   their
    submissions. For instance, I accept the applicant's submission that  in
    reality he was under no pressure of time in respect of  the  expiration
    of his leave which might have explained his use of a proxy to take  the
    test. Further, there appears  to  be  no  obvious  motivation  for  the
    applicant engaging a proxy to take the test. These are factors which  I
    have taken into account in reaching my overall evaluation. I have  also
    taken account of the submission made by Mr Malik that  the  applicant's
    use of cash to pay the fee for the test is of significance, although  I
    am bound to observe that I do not consider that this  is  a  factor  to
    which any great weight can attach. As was observed above, it is not  in
    and of itself indicative of the transaction being fraudulent. I  attach
    more significance in  evaluating  the  weight  which  can  properly  be
    attached to the applicant's evidence the submission made by Mr Malik in
    respect of the extent of the improvement in his English language skills
    between the 2011 test and that which is in question in 2012. In my view
    it is a factor which is clearly in support  of  the  respondent's  case
    that there was a relatively dramatic apparent improvement between these
    two tests and in the space of around 13 months. The marked  improvement
    from a result the equivalent of between 120-149  to  a  result  of  190
    clearly raises question marks  which  undermine  the  evidence  of  the
    applicant.

28. It will be apparent from what has been set out above that  in  my  view
    the decision in this case  is  finely  balanced.  I  have  reached  the
    conclusion, in particular in the light of the absence of any attempt to
    locate and evaluate the recording of  the  applicant's  test,  that  on
    balance the weight which  can  still  properly  be  attributed  to  the
    generic evidence and  the  material  pertaining  to  Queensway  College
    justifies the conclusion that the respondent has discharged the  burden
    placed upon her to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the
    applicants TOIEC certificate  in  the  present  case  was  obtained  by
    deception. I emphasise that this is a conclusion which I  have  reached
    solely on the basis of the balance of the evidence  contained  in  this
    application. Plainly, were additional evidence or  analysis  to  emerge
    then then a different conclusion might be justified.  However,  on  the
    basis of the material before me I  am  satisfied  that  the  respondent
    should succeed and that the applicant's application for judicial review
    must be refused.

Notification of appeal rights

A refusal by the Upper Tribunal  of  permission  to  bring  judicial  review
proceedings  following  a  hearing,  is  a   decision   that   disposes   of
proceedings.

A party may appeal against such a decision to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 7 days of the Tribunal's decision refusing permission  to  appeal  to
the Court of Appeal (CPR 52.9(3)(a)).
