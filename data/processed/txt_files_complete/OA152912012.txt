                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction


[1]  The underlying decision in this appeal is that of the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer ("the ECO"), the Respondent herein, whereby the application  of
    the Appellant for indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom  as  the
    dependent relative of a person present and settled  here  was  refused.
    The Appellant appealed to the  First-Tier  Tribunal  (hereinafter  "the
    Tribunal"), unsuccessfully.  Having secured permission,  the  Appellant
    now appeals to the Upper Tribunal.

Immigration Rules and the Secretary of State's Policy

[2]  We begin with the relevant provisions of the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    subject matter of Part 8 is "family members".  Paragraph 317 prescribes
    the requirements for indefinite leave to enter or remain in the  United
    Kingdom as the parent, grandparent or other  dependent  relative  of  a
    person present and  settled  in  the  United  Kingdom.   Paragraph  317
    stipulates, insofar as relevant to the present case, that the applicant
    -

        "(i) Is related to a person  present  and  settled  in  the  United
             Kingdom in one of the following ways ......


        (f)  The son, daughter, sister, brother, uncle or aunt over the age
             of 18 if living alone outside the United Kingdom  in  the  most
             exceptional circumstances; and


        (ii) Is joining or accompanying a person who is present and settled
             in the United Kingdom ....


        iii) Is financially wholly  or  mainly  dependent  on  the  relative
             present and settled in the United Kingdom; and


         iv) Can, and will, be accommodated adequately,  together  with  any
             dependents, without recourse to public funds, in  accommodation
             which the sponsor owns or occupies exclusively; and


        (a)  Can, and will, be maintained  adequately,  together  with  any
             dependents, without recourse to public funds; and


          v) Has no other close relatives in his  own  country  to  whom  he
             could turn for financial support; and


         vi) If seeking leave to enter, holds a valid United  Kingdom  entry
             clearance for entry in this capacity; and


        vii) Does not have  one  or  more  unspent  convictions  within  the
             meaning of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974."

    By virtue of paragraph 318 of the Rules,  the  production  of  a  valid
    entry clearance certificate is a  pre-requisite  to  admission  to  the
    United Kingdom, upon arrival.

[3]  The operative provisions of the Immigration Rules  must  be  considered
    in conjunction with a relevant policy of the Secretary of State for the
    Home Department ("the Secretary of State").  This is promulgated in the
    Immigration Directorate Instruction ["IDI"]  Chapter  15,  section  2A,
    paragraph 13.2.  In its current form this policy dates from March 2010.
     The purpose and scope of this policy are explained  in  the  following
    introductory statement:

         "This section deals with applications from Ghurkhas and foreign and
         Commonwealth nationals who seek settlement in the UK  on  discharge
         from HM Forces.  It also explains  the  circumstances  under  which
         their dependents may apply for settlement."

     The policy cross refers to paragraph  276  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    This contains a series of discrete provisions relating to the grant  of
    indefinite leave to enter the  United  Kingdom  to  Ghurkhas,  who  are
    defined as citizens or nationals  or  Nepal  who  have  served  in  the
    Brigade of Ghurkhas of the  British  Army.   Within  the  Secretary  of
    State's policy there is a discrete section relating to  the  dependents
    of Ghurkhas aged over 18 years.   Paragraph 13.2 states:

         "Dependents over the age of  18  of  foreign  and  Commonwealth  HM
         Forces members (including Ghurkhas) who are not  otherwise  covered
         in this guidance would normally need to qualify for  settlement  in
         the UK under a specific provisions of the Immigration Rules .....


         In  exceptional  circumstances  discretion  may  be  exercised   in
         individual cases where the dependent is over the age of 18 .....


         However, settlement applications from dependents over the age of 18
         who are the children of serving foreign and Commonwealth HM  Forces
         members (including Ghurkhas) who meet the requirements of a  parent
         should normally be approved, provided the dependent has  previously
         been granted limited leave to enter or remain in the UK as part  of
         the family unit and they wish to continue to reside and be educated
         in the UK."

The ECO's Decision

[4]  In her application for entry clearance, the Appellant stated  that  she
    was seeking to enter the United Kingdom on  the  basis  of  "HM  Forces
    discretion".  She identified the sponsor as her father, a  Ghurkha  now
    aged  53  years,  who  is  settled  in  the  United  Kingdom.    In  an
    accompanying letter written by her solicitors, it  was  contended  that
    the Appellant should be granted  entry  on  the  basis  of  exceptional
    circumstances, which were articulated thus:

         "Our client is the only remaining dependent child of her father,  a
         Ghurkhas veteran, who wishes to  settle  in  the  UK  ......     We
         submit that exceptional circumstances exist in our  client's  case.
         If the  sponsor  had  been  allowed  to  apply  for  settlement  on
         discharge from the Brigade of Ghurkhas on  retirement,  our  client
         would have qualified for settlement as his  minor  dependent.   The
         historic injustice as recognised by the High Court is a factor that
         should weigh heavily in our client's favour."





    It was further contended that a  refusal  of  entry  clearance  to  the
    Appellant would infringe her rights under Article 8 ECHR.   In  support
    of this contention, the solicitors drew attention to  the  decision  of
    the Court of Appeal in JB (India) [2009] EWCA Civ  234,  together  with
    certain decisions of this Tribunal.

[5]  In his decision, the ECO acknowledged that the  Appellant's  father  is
    present  and  settled  in  the  United  Kingdom,  having  been  granted
    indefinite leave to remain on 6th July 2006.  It was  noted  that  some
    four months later, settlement visas  were  issued  to  the  Appellant's
    mother and her two siblings, then aged 7  and  17  years  respectively.
    The ECO determined, firstly, that the Appellant's application  did  not
    satisfy the requirements of paragraph 317  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    This seems to us uncontroversial, having been conceded in  the  written
    representations of her solicitors.  The ECO then proceeded to  consider
    the application under the Secretary of  State's  policy.  He  concluded
    that the Appellant had not demonstrated any exceptional  circumstances.
    In thus concluding, he  highlighted  that  the  sponsor/adult  daughter
    relationships had no atypical features; the Appellant  had  no  medical
    conditions or disability; she had reasonable housing accommodation  and
    income producing land; she had qualified as a doctor and had chosen  to
    pursue her studies, rather than seek employment; and she had previously
    submitted two unsuccessful applications for settlement and visit visas,
    one resulting in an unsuccessful appeal.  Finally,  the  ECO  concluded
    that a refusal of entry clearance would not engage  Article  8(1)  ECHR
    or, alternatively, would not  interfere  disproportionately  therewith.
    The ECO recorded, specifically, that the Appellant had not resided with
    her parents since 2005; her professional qualifications were such  that
    she could be self supporting financially; and she  did  not  appear  to
    have a close relationship with her siblings.

The Determination of the First-tier Tribunal ("FTT")

[6]  The Appellant duly exercised her right of appeal.  It  is  recorded  in
    the  Determination  of  the  FTT  that,  as  presented  by  her   legal
    representative, the Appellant's primary case was under Article  8  ECHR
    and her secondary case was based on the Secretary  of  State's  policy.
    The witnesses who testified were the Appellant's  parents.   The  Judge
    made a specific finding that the Appellant's father makes a significant
    financial contribution to  her  upkeep  and  outgoings.  Based  on  his
    analysis of the earnings of the Appellant's father and mother, he found
    that they had at  their  disposal,  some  ï¿½1,084  per  month  for  this
    purpose.  As this would be available in  the  event  of  the  Appellant
    entering the United Kingdom and residing with them,  he  further  found
    that she would be adequately maintained and  accommodated.   The  Judge
    then considered the Appellant's Article 8 case.  He did so  extensively
    and sympathetically.  He did not, however, make any  explicit  findings
    or conclusions.  While he appeared to be travelling in the direction of
    a conclusion that the impugned decision  did  not  interfere  with  the
    right to respect for family life vis-ï¿½-vis any of the five  members  of
    the family unit concerned, he did not so conclude explicitly.


[7]  The Judge then turned to consider the Secretary of State's policy.   He
    stated, in paragraph [41]:

         "There are three aspects of the decision with which I have concern.
          The first relates to the Respondent's  conclusion,  considered  in
         respect of paragraph 317, that the Appellant  was  not  financially
         supported by her father .............


         I am  satisfied,  for  reasons  I  have  already  given,  that  the
         Appellant was, at the date of decision, financial dependent on  her
         father ..............


         Secondly, there is no indication in the Notice of Refusal that  the
         Respondent has given any consideration to  the  'stranded  sibling'
         principle ..............


         Although the most recent IDS do not make specific reference to this
         purpose it clearly remains a relevant and  material  consideration.
         The failure to give any indication that  this  principle  had  been
         considered indicates that the Respondent failed to take account  of
         a relevant consideration ..............


         Thirdly, there is no consideration in the  Notice  of  Decision  in
         respect of the exemplary service given by  the  Appellant's  father
         (and, possibly, grandfather).


         Nor was there any acknowledgement  of  the  past  historical  wrong
         identified in Gurung in  respect  of  the  previous  discriminatory
         treatment received by  Ghurkhas  in  comparison  to  other  British
         soldiers.  I accept the father's evidence that, had he been able to
         apply for settlement when he was discharged, he would have  applied
         for settlement for himself and  his  family.   The  decision  under
         appeal does not acknowledge these highly relevant considerations."

     Having identified and elaborated upon these three  factors,  the  Judge
concluded:

         "Having  regard  to  my  three  concerns  identified  above,  I  am
         persuaded that the decision was not  in  accordance  with  the  law
         because  the  Respondent  failed  to  take  account   of   relevant
         considerations.  I therefore allow the appeal to the limited extent
         that it is remitted  back  to  the  Respondent  to  make  a  lawful
         decision  in  respect  of  the  application  of  the   'exceptional
         circumstances' policy."

    The Judge dismissed the appeal under the Immigration  Rules  and  under
    Article 8 ECHR.


[8]  To summarise, the FTT:

      a) dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.


      b) dismissed the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.

      c) found that the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  was  vitiated  on
         account  of  a  failure  to  take  into   account   four   material
         considerations viz that the Appellant is financially  dependent  on
         her father; the "stranded sibling" principle; the exemplary British
         Military service given by the Appellant's  father  (and,  possibly,
         grandfather); and the Gurung "past historical wrong" factor.

      d) pursuant to (c), allowed  the  appeal  to  the  limited  extent  of
         remitting the matter to the Secretary of State  to  make  a  lawful
         decision in respect of the application of the IDI Policy (supra).

THE SCOPE OF THIS APPEAL

[9]  One of the striking  features  of  this  further  appeal  is  that  the
    Appellant was successful at first instance, in the  sense  and  to  the
    extent explained above. Successful litigants can, of course, appeal  in
    certain contexts and we are satisfied that this is one of them,  having
    regard to the rejection of the Appellant's appeal to the FTT on certain
    grounds and the limited nature of the success secured by  her  in  that
    forum. In granting the Appellant permission to appeal,  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge McGeachy, having observed that the Respondent had not  challenged
    the Judge's decision to require a lawful fresh  decision  to  be  made,
    reasoned as follows:

         "I consider that it is arguable that the Judge should have  weighed
         that in the balance in the proportionality exercise the reasons for
         which he found that the decision was not in accordance with the law
         and that there is an arguable error of law in his not doing so."

     The relationship between the grant of  permission  to  appeal  and  the
    Appellant's grounds of  appeal  is  not  entirely  clear,  possibly  on
    account of the inadvertent  intrusion  of  the  second  "that"  in  the
    passage quoted above, which has disturbed the syntax somewhat.   It  is
    clear, in any event, from the reference to  Article  8  ECHR  that  the
    Judge intended to grant permission to appeal under  this  heading.   We
    draw  attention  to  the  grounds,   which   embodied   the   following
    contentions:

     a) The Tribunal had erred in law by misdirecting itself in its Article
        8 assessment, specifically by failing to consider AA - v  -  United
        Kingdom [2012] IMM Ar 1, paragraph [49] especially, and by  failing
        to provide sufficient reasons for not finding  that  the  Appellant
        had met the threshold established by the decision in Ghising (which
        the Judge had considered in paragraph [29]).


     b) The Judge had erred in law by misdirecting himself  that  emotional
        dependency had to be shown  (and,  by  implication,  had  not  been
        demonstrated) in  order  to  establish  the  Appellant's  right  to
        respect for family life under Article 8(1) ECHR.

     c)  The  Tribunal  erred  in  law,   by   inadequate   reasoning   and
        irrationality, in holding the sponsor's military service irrelevant
        to the existence of family life, the contention  being  that  prior
        separation of family members is relevant to  the  strength  of  the
        surviving emotional bonds.



    In short, the grounds of appeal complained that the Tribunal had  erred
    in law in its consideration and  resolution  of  the  Appellant's  case
    under Article 8.


Consideration and Conclusions

[10] Mr Saldanha, on behalf of the Appellant, accepted that the  appeal  was
    proceeding on Article 8 ECHR grounds only and refined his  argument  to
    two submissions.  The first was that the FTT had misdirected itself  in
    law by considering that emotional dependency had to be demonstrated  in
    order to make good the Appellant's case under Article 8 ECHR.  He based
    this submission on Pun and Others (Gurkhas - Policy - Article 8) Nepal,
    [2011] UKUT 00117.  In  paragraph  [22]  of  Pun,  the  Upper  Tribunal
    considered the decisions of the House of Lords in  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL
    27, Huang [2007] UKHL 7 and EB (Kosovo) [200  ]  UKHL  ......,  quoting
    the following extract from the opinion of Lord Bingham  in  the  latter
    case:

         "Matters  such  as  the  age,  health  and  vulnerability  of   the
         applicant, the closeness and previous history of  the  family,  the
         applicant's dependence on the financial and  emotional  support  of
         the family, the prevailing cultural conditions in  the  country  of
         origin and many other factors may all be relevant."

     [Our emphasis]

    Next, the Upper Tribunal noted that in Kugathas - v - IAT  [2003]  EWCA
    Civ 31, the Court of Appeal held that  family  life  between  an  adult
    child and  parent  or  other  sibling  requires  the  demonstration  of
    something more than normal emotional  ties:  per  Arden  LJ,  paragraph
    [25].   The  Tribunal  accepted  that  this  could  [our  emphasis]  be
    established  by  proof  of  "a  strong  family   bond   and   financial
    dependence", while opining  that  this  should  not  be  considered  "a
    necessary requirement or as determinative of the issue of whether there
    is family life within Article 8".  It emphasised,  in  paragraph  [24],
    the contextual and fact sensitive nature of every Article 8 case.


[11] Basing his argument on the passages in Pun and Others to which we  have
    referred above, Mr Saldanha submitted that  misdirections  in  law  are
    evident in paragraphs [30] and [34] of the FTT  Determination.   Within
    these passages, the Judge rehearsed certain facts which prompted him to
    find that the Appellant was clearly financially dependent on her family
    during the five year period of her  third  level  education  in  China,
    between 2005 and 2010.  He recorded that  between  2005  and  2006  her
    mother and two younger siblings were resident in Nepal, following which
    all three secured entry clearance to reside in the United Kingdom, duly
    exercised in early 2008.   The  Appellant  applied  unsuccessfully  for
    settlement in the same year. She then returned to China  and  continued
    to study there.  She made no further application to  enter  the  United
    Kingdom until seeking a visitor's entry visa in 2011 (fully three years
    later, we would observe).  At this stage she  was  preparing  for  post
    graduate studies in Nepal, having qualified as a medical  doctor.   The
    Judge stated:

         "This indicates that the Appellant is an intelligent,  capable  and
         resourceful individual, albeit that  she  is  reliant  financially,
         directly and indirectly, on her father."

    Next, in paragraph [31], having rehearsed  certain  relevant  evidence,
    the Judge rejected the submission that  the  Appellant  is  emotionally
    dependent on her parents.   He then reminded himself of the requirement
    to consider every case on its individual facts and merits.  Having done
    so, he continued:


         "[34]    Whilst I have no reason to disbelieve  the  evidence  that
             the family are  close  their  emotional  attachment  does  not
             appear to be any different from  the  normal  emotional  bonds
             that exist between adult  children  and  their  parents  .....
             There is no evidence of  any  significant  emotional  reliance
             ....


         [35] .......  The Appellant cannot be  considered  a  young  child.
             She was over 25.5 years old at the date of  decision  and  had
             lived apart from her family since 2005."


[12] We are satisfied that there was no misdirection in law  by  the  Judge.
    In the paragraphs under scrutiny, the Judge was, properly,  undertaking
    the exercise of examining the factually sensitive nature  of  the  case
    before him. He also addressed specifically, and proceeded to determine,
    a submission that  the  Appellant  was  emotionally  dependent  on  her
    parents.  This we consider irreproachable.  We find  nothing  in  these
    passages to suggest that the Judge elevated  the  factor  of  emotional
    dependency to a necessary  pre-requisite  of  a  successful  Article  8
    claim.  We reject this ground of appeal accordingly.  In doing  so,  we
    are mindful that in R (Gurung) - v - Secretary of State  for  the  Home
    Department [2013] EWCA 8, the Court  of  Appeal  stated,  in  paragraph
    [50]:


             "The  critical  issue  was  whether   there   was   sufficient
             dependence, and in particular sufficient emotional dependence,
             by the Appellants on their parents to justify  the  conclusion
             that they enjoyed family life.  That was a  question  of  fact
             for the FTT to determine.  In our view, the FTT  was  entitled
             to conclude that, although the usual emotional  bonds  between
             parents and their children were present, the requisite  degree
             of emotional dependence was absent."

    This passage confirms, firstly, the truism, frequently emphasised, that
    every case is factually sensitive and, secondly, that it will often  be
    proper to consider and determine the issue of emotional  dependence  in
    Article 8 cases involving adult children such as this Appellant.

[13] The second discrete submission advanced  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant
    resolved to the contention that the FTT had erred in law by failing  to
    take into account that the Appellant's younger brother is a minor.  The
    gist of this submission appears to us to be  that  the  FTT  failed  to
    properly appreciate the composition of  the  Appellant's  family.   The
    evidence before the  Tribunal  included  a  witness  statement  of  the
    Appellant's father which, inter alia, drew attention to the age of  the
    youngest of the three children (who was born on 25th January  1999  and
    is now aged  14  years)  and  his  student  status.   Furthermore,  the
    evidence included the younger brother's entry visa, which contains  all
    of his relevant particulars.  In  addition,  the  family  circumstances
    were rehearsed by the Judge in paragraph [2] of the Determination.   We
    have no warrant for concluding that  the  Judge  failed  to  take  into
    account that the  Appellant's  younger  brother  is  a  minor.  We  can
    identify no misdirection in law in this  respect  and  we  reject  this
    submission accordingly.

DECISION

[14] For the reasons elaborated above, we dismiss the appeal and affirm  the
    decision of the FTT.
