                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Talat Sadiqa, born  on  12  January  1979  is  a  female
    citizen of Pakistan.  The appellant first entered the United Kingdom in
    August 2008 as a spouse.  She obtained further leave to remain until 14
    March 2013 but, by a decision dated 9 May  2013,  her  application  for
    further leave to remain was rejected by the respondent.   She  appealed
    against that decision to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Batiste) which,
    in a determination promulgated on 28 October 2013 dismissed the appeal.
     The appellant now appeals to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Both parties agreed that the appellant  could  not  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  Her appeal is on Article 8 ECHR grounds only.

 3. Judge Batiste set out the appellant's case at [8] as follows:

    The appellant's case is relatively simple.  When she came to the United
    Kingdom in 2008  there  was  no  English  language  requirement  before
    spouses could enter the country.  It is the appellant's case that after
    she entered the United Kingdom, the sponsor became unwell such that  he
    lost his job (for which he  received  a  payment  of  ï¿½5,500  from  the
    Employment Tribunal) and has needed constant caring.  As a result it is
    claimed that the sponsor is unfit to work and is therefore dependent on
    benefits to support himself and the appellant.  Furthermore, given that
    he is in need of constant care, the appellant has been entirely  unable
    to study for any English certificates and has not undertaken any.  As a
    result the appellant could not succeed with any application  under  the
    Immigration Rules and instead made an application outside the Rules.

 4. The judge was not satisfied [9] with the evidence  of  the  appellant's
    husband's (hereafter referred to as the sponsor) medical condition.  He
    found that "the medical evidence  provided  [does  not]  even  approach
    supporting the contention for which  it  is  put  forward,  namely  the
    sponsor is unable to work and  requires  almost  constant  care".   The
    judge noted that the sponsor was  not  in  receipt  of  any  disability
    benefits including disability living allowance (DLA).  The judge  found
    that the appellant had been able  to  undertake  the  English  language
    course had she wanted to do so.  Her inability to comply with the Rules
    was, therefore, a problem of her own making.

 5. The grounds complain that the judge had concentrated upon  the  English
    language requirement and financial matters thereby raising  new  issues
    regarding which the appellant was given no opportunity to comment.   It
    is asserted that  the  appellant  has  been  "unjustly  prevented  from
    providing relevant evidence in line with the case of RM (Kwok On  Tong:
    HC 395 para 320) India [2006] UKAIT 00039." [grounds, 3].

 6. I reject that ground of appeal.  The judge was carrying out an  Article
    8 ECHR assessment and was, therefore, required to have  regard  to  all
    relevant evidence.  That the appellant and the sponsor were in  receipt
    of public funds and that the appellant had not attempted to obtain  the
    English language requirement which may have allowed her to comply  with
    the Immigration Rules were undisputed facts in this appeal.  They  were
    not new matters raised by the judge at the hearing.  No indication  has
    been given of what "relevant evidence" in addition to  that  which  had
    been adduced the appellant intends to provide concerning those  issues.
    The appellant had been made aware that, if she sought to obtain further
    leave to remain as a spouse, she needed to study  for,  and  pass,  the
    English language test.  The fact that the appellant  had  done  nothing
    whatever to satisfy that requirement is clearly a relevant fact in  the
    appeal.  Indeed, it weighed heavily in favour of the public interest in
    the Article 8 assessment; removal of those who make no effort to comply
    with the Immigration Rules and seek, in effect, simply to rely  on  the
    fact that they happen to be residing in the United Kingdom in order  to
    remain here is clearly a strong one.

 7. Mr Shah also complained that the judge had attached too much weight  to
    the fact that the appellant and sponsor are reliant upon the  sponsor's
    employment allowance.  He submitted  that  the  appellant  herself  had
    never sought to rely upon public funds.  Although it is not clear  from
    the papers, it would seem that the appellant and sponsor have contrived
    to exist on an employment allowance which is paid solely to the sponsor
    an arrangement which may  have  the  effect  that  both  appellant  and
    sponsor are living on funds below  income  support  levels.   This,  in
    turn, gives a clear indication that, if the appellant were to be  given
    Article 8 leave to remain, she would need to seek  public  funds.   The
    judge rightly observed that that was also a factor weighing  in  favour
    of the public interest.

 8. The dilemma with which the judge was faced was that of an appellant who
    was in  a  subsisting  marriage  with  a  British  citizen  and  cannot
    reasonably be expected to relocate  outside  the  European  Union  (see
    Sanade and others (British children - Zambrano -  Dereci)  [2012]  UKUT
    00048(IAC)).  The fact of the sponsor's British  citizenship,  however,
    together with the subsistence of  the  marriage  does  not  compel  the
    Tribunal to allow the appeal on Article 8 ECHR  grounds.   It  remained
    open to the judge to assess proportionality  and  either  to  allow  or
    dismiss the appeal.  Mr Shah, for the appellant, did not disagree  with
    that proposition.  I find that Judge Batiste has not erred in law.   He
    has taken into account relevant and undisputed  evidence  (for  example
    regarding the appellant's inability to undertake the  English  language
    test and her likely future reliance on public  funds)  in  reaching  an
    outcome  which  was  plainly  available  to  him  notwithstanding   the
    sponsor's nationality and the subsistence of the marriage.   I  see  no
    reason to interfere with his decision for the reasons asserted  in  the
    grounds or otherwise.

Decision

This appeal is dismissed.
