            Application for judicial review: substantive decision

Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective representatives, Mr Z Jafferji, of Counsel, instructed by  Abbott
Solicitors, on behalf  of  the  Applicant  and  Mr  T  Tabori,  of  Counsel,
instructed by the Government Legal Department, on behalf of the  Respondent,
at a hearing at Field House, London on 28 January 2020.

      Decision: the application for judicial review is refused

                                  JUDGMENT


   1. This application for judicial review, filed on 5 February 2019,  is  a
      challenge by the applicant to the respondent's decision on 17 December
      2018 to reject her application for a fee  waiver  and  the  subsequent
      decision on 2 January 2019 which rejected her application for leave to
      remain on the basis that it was invalid due to her failure to pay  the
      required fee.


   2. The initial basis of the challenge is that the respondent: (1)  failed
      to adhere to her own guidance in not giving the applicant ten days  to
      adduce further evidence before rejecting the application;  (2)  failed
      to consider the applicant's representations of 27 December  2018,  and
      (3) acted unlawfully in breaching the applicant's human rights as  her
      right to work was curtailed. The applicant was, therefore,  unable  to
      provide  for  her  children  and  this   breached   the   respondent's
      obligations under s.55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act
      2009.  The grounds for renewal set out the first two grounds but  seek
      to incorporate the third argument within the second ground.


   3. On  14  May  2019,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Reeds  refused  the  first
      application on papers, but the renewed application was granted by John
      Kimbell QC, sitting as a Judge of the Upper Tribunal, on 18 July  2019
      following an oral hearing.  It was considered that the respondent  had
      arguably failed to apply her own policy and that this was a procedural
      irregularity which  led  to  the  further  evidence  supplied  by  the
      applicant on 27 December 2018  not  being  properly  considered.   The
      third ground, either as a separate argument, or as part of the second,
      was not pursued.



      Background



   4. The applicant is a Pakistani national born on 18  October  1989.   She
      entered the UK as a student, but her leave expired in April  2013,  an
      application for further leave was refused and her appeal  against  the
      decision was dismissed. The applicant then made a private/family  life
      application. This was refused. Further representations were then  made
      on the basis that her daughter had a right of  residence  as  she  was
      born before her parents divorced and her father was an  EEA  national.
      On 9 May 2016 the applicant was granted leave outside the rules  until
      8 November 2018. It would appear, however, that  the  applicant  never
      married her partner.


   5. On 3 November 2018 the applicant sought further leave and applied  for
      a fee waiver. She maintained that she resided for free with a  friend,
      she had not been asked  to  leave,  she  did  not  receive  any  local
      authority support, that she would not be homeless any time soon,  that
      she received support from her ex-partner (the father of her children),
      although this had recently decreased, that she had  one  bank  account
      with Lloyds and that her total monthly income was �250 which  was  �15
      more than her outgoings.


   6. The respondent  did  not  consider  she  had  sufficient  evidence  or
      information to make a decision on the fee  waiver  application  and  a
      credit check had revealed  that  the  applicant  had  two  other  bank
      accounts  which  she  had  failed  to  disclose.  The  applicant  was,
      therefore, asked by email on  27  November  2018  to  provide  further
      evidence  in  the  form  of  statements  for  the  two  accounts,  and
      explanations for all her major outgoing and incoming payments. She was
      also given the opportunity to provide any further evidence which might
      assist her application.


   7. The applicant responded on 10 December 2018 by  email,  providing  the
      bank statements and explaining that  she  had  forgotten  about  those
      accounts as she had not used  them  in  a  long  time  (although  they
      contained recent transactions). A letter from her former  partner  was
      also adduced.


   8. On 17  December  2018,  on  the  basis  of  the  application  and  the
      additional evidence and information, the respondent concluded that the
      appellant did not qualify for a fee waiver as she had not  shown  that
      she was destitute or would be rendered destitute by the payment of the
      fee, and that there were no exceptional circumstances which would make
      a fee waiver appropriate. She was given time to make the fee payment.


   9. On 27 December 2018, the applicant emailed the respondent with further
      information as to her incoming and outgoing payments, but this  letter
      was not considered as a decision on the fee waiver  had  already  been
      made. The respondent's view was that  she  had  already  provided  the
      applicant with an opportunity to adduce further evidence and  even  if
      the further representations had been considered, they would  not  have
      affected the outcome of the application as  the  applicant  had  still
      failed to show that she was destitute.


  10.  On  2  January  2019,  the  respondent  decided  to  invalidate   the
      applicant's application on the basis that no fee had been paid.


  11. On 5 February 2019, the applicant filed a judicial review claim.  This
      was refused on the papers by Upper Tribunal Judge Reeds on 14 May 2019
      but granted following an oral hearing on 9 July 2019.



      The Hearing



  12. The matter came before me on 28 January 2020.  The  applicant  arrived
      late but was present for most of the hearing.


  13. On behalf of the applicant, Mr Jafferji submitted that this was not  a
      challenge to the rationality  of  the  respondent's  decisions  but  a
      challenge on procedural irregularity on the  basis  that  the  correct
      procedure was not followed. I was referred to the policy  guidance  on
      Fee Waiver applications in Human Rights-Based applications, Version 2,
      30 August 2017, at (internal) p.23 which stated that  applicants  with
      in-time applications who do  not  qualify  for  a  fee  waiver  should
      normally be advised to pay the  fee  or  produce  further  documentary
      evidence to demonstrate that they do qualify. He accepted  that  there
      would be cases where this was not done but he argued that  no  reasons
      had been given for  why  this  approach  was  not  followed  here.  He
      submitted that it  was  unclear  as  to  whether  the  caseworker  was
      exercising his/her discretion under the policy and deciding  that  the
      further opportunity afforded under that policy should not be  provided
      to the applicant or whether the caseworker overlooked this option.  He
      argued that  a  request  for  further  information  and  evidence  was
      different to the opportunity in the policy offered to an applicant  to
      provide a response to the reasons for the refusal of  the  fee  waiver
      application. He pointed to p.14 of the  policy  and  argued  that  the
      request for further evidence was made on the basis envisaged  in  this
      part of the  policy.  At  the  point  the  caseworker  sought  further
      information/evidence, he/she was  anticipating  that  the  application
      might be granted. The application could simply have  been  refused  on
      the basis of insufficient evidence  but  that  was  not  the  approach
      taken. The normal course of events was  that  an  applicant  was  made
      aware of the reasons for the refusal and given  a  chance  to  provide
      further evidence or to pay the fee before becoming an  overstayer.  He
      further relied on the current guidance of January 2019  and  submitted
      that it was clear that if the further evidence, to be provided  within
      10 working days, did not demonstrate an applicant qualified, then  the
      application should be rejected as invalid. He submitted there had been
      no substantial changes to the newer version of the policy and that  it
      was fair to provide applicants with  the  opportunity  to  respond  to
      shortcomings in their applications. It would not be fair to refuse her
      application as had been  done  without  providing  her  with  such  an
      opportunity. The applicant had two young children and the decision had
      to be proportionate and in their best interests.


  14. Mr Jafferji submitted that when the applicant  received  the  decision
      letter, she notified the respondent that she had not  been  given  ten
      working days to provide further information. She then provided further
      documentary evidence including a further signed letter from her former
      partner. Such a document was of the type of documents  the  respondent
      had listed in the policy as appropriate. The decision letter  did  not
      reject the  application  as  incredible.  It  went  through  the  bank
      statements and queried the transactions and the use of her account  by
      her former partner before the conclusions on destitution were reached.
      The applicant was refused on the  basis  that  matters  had  not  been
      addressed. Her further submissions had not been considered even though
      the decision could have been reviewed at  that  stage.  The  decisions
      should be quashed as they contained public law errors and the  refusal
      letter should be re-served in accordance with the  policy  and  giving
      the applicant ten days to provide further evidence or to pay the fee.


  15.  Mr  Tabori  responded.  He  maintained  that  despite  the   detailed
      submissions that had been made, the issue was a very  narrow  one.  He
      took me to the respondent's email to the applicant of 27 November 2018
      pointing out that the applicant had been given until 11 December  2018
      (ten working days) to provide further information and  evidence.  This
      was fully in compliance with the policy as set out at p.23. He pointed
      out that the challenge was not one made against the  fairness  of  the
      policy but to the respondent's  alleged  non-compliance  with  it.  He
      submitted that the  evidence  demonstrated  that  the  respondent  had
      complied. He submitted that the applicant appeared to be arguing  that
      she should be  given  two  opportunities  by  caseworkers  to  provide
      evidence. That was not what her grounds had argued,  and  it  was  not
      what the policy provided. The policy made plain the types of documents
      required, it incorporated the principles set out in Omar  [2012]  EWHC
      3448 (Admin) and Carter [2014] EWHC  2603  (Admin)  and  it  struck  a
      balance between administrative expediency and procedural fairness. The
      policy gave an applicant a single opportunity. The respondent had been
      found to be entitled to take a rigorous approach to  fees  in  Carter.
      The onus was on an applicant to provide information and that was  made
      clear in the policy.


  16. Mr Tabori submitted that the email from the  respondent  directed  the
      applicant as to what further information and evidence she was required
      to produce. There was no requirement for the respondent to  then  give
      her a further opportunity. The decision letter of 17 December 2018 was
      in response to the further information and evidence she had  provided.
      It gave adequate reasons. It did not generate another opportunity  for
      the applicant to respond to deficiencies in her  application  and  the
      concerns raised therein could not  have  been  put  to  the  applicant
      earlier as they arose from her subsequent evidence.


  17. Mr Jafferji replied. He submitted that the respondent's case rested on
      an acceptance that  the  email  of  27  November  2018  triggered  the
      approach at p.23 of  the  policy.  If  that  was  accepted,  then  the
      applicant had no case. However, if it was accepted that the email  was
      in response to the approach suggested at p.14 of the policy, then  the
      applicant had  not  been  given  an  opportunity  to  provide  further
      information as envisaged in the later part of the policy (at p.23). In
      his submission, the email was not a decision but simply a request  for
      further information. The caseworker had not said that he/she  was  not
      satisfied that the applicant did not qualify for  a  fee  waiver,  the
      applicant was not told to pay the fee or submit further evidence. When
      the email and the policy contents were compared, it was clear that the
      email followed the policy at p. 14. It was not a decision and  only  a
      request for  information.  The  respondent's  case  was  fundamentally
      flawed. The claim should be allowed.


  18. Mr Tabori sought to clarify a point. He submitted that  the  applicant
      had changed her argument from complaining that the email did not refer
      to ten working days to now saying that it did not say her  application
      had been rejected. He pointed out that the policy (at 23) was a  route
      to rejection. It was plain at the time the email  was  sent  that  the
      applicant's evidence had been insufficient to qualify her  for  a  fee
      waiver and that was why more evidence was requested. The applicant was
      just picking on the wording of the correspondence. It would be bizarre
      for the respondent to state that she was refusing the application  yet
      ask for more documents. There had been manifest  compliance  with  the
      policy. The request for information did not fall within the  ambit  of
      the missing documents scenario at p.14 because the request was not for
      missing documents but those which the applicant had not disclosed.  It
      would be illogical to treat applicants who had omitted  to  include  a
      document or part of a sequence of documents in the same way  as  those
      who had sought to conceal evidence.


  19. Mr Jafferji repeated his submission that the  respondent's  email  did
      not reject the application. He submitted that the case worker had made
      an error. He submitted that the shortcomings of the  application  were
      not relevant to the operation of the policy.


  20. That completed submissions and concluded the hearing.  I  reserved  my
      decision which I now give.
      Analysis and conclusions

  21. I have taken full account of the evidence and  the  submissions  made.
      Having done so, I conclude that the  Secretary  of  State's  decisions
      were both reasonable, rational and disclose no public law  error.    I
      now set out my reasons which are in no order of priority.


  22. The applicant relies on the respondent's policy of 30 August  2017  on
      fee waivers made in human rights-based applications. Mr Jafferji  made
      reference to the more recent version of 4 January 2019  but  that  was
      not the policy in place when the decisions were  made.  In  any  case,
      there are no substantial differences between them, and I have  focused
      on the earlier guidance as that was operative at  the  relevant  time.
      The added emphases are mine. The relevant sections state:


"In assessing the fee waiver application the caseworker must have regard to
the duty under section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act
2009 to safeguard and promote the welfare of any affected child, and
therefore to the best interests of any such child as a primary
consideration" (at p.5).



"When applying for a fee waiver the applicant will be asked to provide full
details of their financial circumstances, including statements covering the
6 months period prior to the date of application for any bank or building
society accounts they hold. They must also provide a full breakdown of
their monthly income and expenditure at the time of application" (at p.5).



"Checks may be undertaken with agencies such as HM Revenue  &  Customs,  the
Department for Work and Pensions and Equifax to verify information  provided
by the applicant with regard to their  income  and  finances  (see  Document
Verification guidance). ...Applicants who fail to disclose  their  financial
circumstances in full, or who provide false information in their fee  waiver
request, may have current or future  applications  for  leave  to  enter  or
remain refused because of their conduct (see  General  grounds  for  refusal
guidance). They may also be referred for enforcement  action,  resulting  in
possible arrest and removal" (at p.6).



The qualifying criteria are:

         . "Where the applicant has demonstrated by way  of  evidence  that
           they are destitute

         . Where the applicant has demonstrated by  way  of  evidence  that
           they would be rendered destitute by payment of the  fee  because
           whilst they have adequate accommodation and can meet their other
           essential living needs:

            -  They  have  no  disposable   income,   such   that   without
              compromising  their   ability   to   accommodate   themselves
              adequately or meet their other essential living  needs,  they
              could now either pay the fee  or  save  the  required  amount
              within a reasonable period (and it would be reasonable in all
              the circumstances  to  expect  the  applicant  to  delay  the
              application for this length of time, taking into  account  in
              particular the potential impact of  such  a  delay  on  their
              immigration status and access to work and benefits)

            - They are unable to borrow the required amount from family  or
              friends

            -  There  is  no  basis  for  believing  that  the  applicant's
              financial  circumstances  are  likely  to  change  within   a
              reasonable period (and it would  be  reasonable  in  all  the
              circumstances  to  expect  the  applicant  to   delay   their
              application for this length of time)

         .  Where the applicant has demonstrated by way  of  evidence  that
           notwithstanding the fact that  neither  of  the  above  criteria
           apply, there are exceptional circumstances in  their case  such
           that a fee waiver should be granted" (at p.12).




  23. A destitute person is defined in the following way:
         . "they do  not  have  adequate  accommodation  or  any  means  of
           obtaining it (whether or not their other essential living  needs
           are met)
         . they have adequate accommodation or the means  of  obtaining  it
           but cannot meet their other essential living needs" (at p.12).


  24. The policy also gives guidance on the assessment of  the  application.
      It makes it clear that: "the fee waiver application must  be  assessed
      on the basis of the information provided in the completed  Appendix  1
      and the accompanying documentary evidence. If the applicant  does  not
      complete every section of Appendix 1,  their  application  for  a  fee
      waiver should be rejected on that basis alone. In every case where  an
      applicant submits an Appendix 1 and makes an  application  for  a  fee
      waiver, the caseworker should assess the information provided  to  see
      whether they qualify. It is the responsibility  of  the  applicant  to
      fully evidence  their  claimed  financial  circumstances.  Caseworkers
      should not normally make additional enquiries  to  try  and  establish
      whether an applicant qualifies for a fee waiver. The applicant may  be
      requested to provide a missing document (or part of one) to which  the
      fee waiver application refers where the  caseworker  anticipates  that
      its provision will lead to a grant of a fee waiver. Caseworkers should
      otherwise base the decision on a fee waiver  on  the  information  and
      evidence provided and any verification checks" (p. 14).


      "...caseworkers  must  make  reasonable   efforts   to   decide   such
      applications promptly" (at p.15).


  25. On the consideration of documentary evidence, the policy provides:


      "The assessment of whether an individual qualifies for  a  fee  waiver
      will be made on the basis of their own  individual  circumstances  and
      those of any dependent family members. The onus is on the applicant to
      demonstrate that they qualify for a fee  waiver.  The  applicant  must
      provide  relevant  documentation  to   evidence   their   fee   waiver
      application,  including  detailed  evidence  as  to  their   financial
      circumstances. For example, caseworkers should normally expect to  see
      information and evidence relating to  the  applicant's  income,  their
      accommodation, the type and adequacy of this, and the amount of  their
      rent/ mortgage or  of  their  contribution  towards  this,  and  their
      outgoings in terms of spending on things  like  food,  utility  bills.
      This information should be supported by independent evidence, such  as
      their pay slips, bank statements, tenancy  agreement,  utility  bills.
      The nature of  the  evidence  provided  will  vary  depending  on  the
      individual circumstances of the applicant, but the  caseworker  should
      expect to see evidence appropriate to the circumstances that are being
      claimed. If the applicant is being supported by family or  friends,  a
      local authority or a registered charity, the caseworker should  expect
      to see corroborating  documentary  evidence  confirming  provision  of
      support and detailing the nature and amount of the  support  provided.
      In all cases evidence must be up-to-date. Documents dating  back  more
      than a few months will be useful  in  establishing  how  the  person's
      finances have changed over time but should be given reduced weight  in
      establishing whether the applicant meets the fee  waiver  policy  now"
      (at p.15).


      "An applicant claiming to be destitute will need to  provide  evidence
      that they are destitute. In all cases the onus is on the applicant  to
      provide evidence that  they  are  destitute...If  a  person  has  been
      without any formal or obvious means of support (such  as  income  from
      employment or local authority support) for a prolonged period, it  may
      be reasonable for the caseworker to assume that the  person  has  had,
      any may continue to have, access to an  alternative  form  of  support
      (for example, income from overseas or  from  a  relative  or  friend),
      unless the applicant provides evidence that this is not  the  case  or
      that their circumstances have changed and they  are  now  without  any
      means of support" (at p. 17).


      "The applicant will need to provide relevant evidence of their  income
      and expenditure so that their disposable  income  can  be  calculated.
      Caseworkers  will  need  to  use  their  judgement  in  assessing  the
      applicant's  spending  habits  to  decide  whether  or  not  they  are
      considered to have disposable income and the amount of this"(at p.18).


      Regard should be had to  circumstances  where  an  applicant  "buys  a
      personal possession that is clearly  not  essential  to  their  living
      needs..." (at p.18).

  26. The issue of exceptional circumstances is also considered:


      "An example of exceptional circumstances may be where the applicant is
      not destitute and would not be rendered destitute by  paying  the  fee
      but cannot afford to pay it because they need to spend  the  money  on
      essential child  welfare  needs,  because  of  a  child's  illness  or
      disability. A decision on whether there are exceptional  circumstances
      should be made on  a  case-by-case  basis,  taking  into  account  the
      applicant's individual circumstances and those of any dependent family
      member and all the information and evidence the applicant provides  in
      support of their fee  waiver  request.  The  applicant  will  need  to
      demonstrate that there is something exceptional about their  financial
      circumstances and ability to pay the fee such that a fee waiver should
      be granted, despite the fact that they have not provided  evidence  of
      destitution or that they would be rendered destitute by payment of the
      fee" (at p. 18).


      "The caseworker must  take  into  account  the  applicant's  household
      income and assets,  including  income  and  assets  belonging  to  the
      applicant's spouse or partner, (as well as any other adult  with  whom
      the applicant lives and from whom they receive financial support)  and
      to their children and any other  dependants.  Provision  of  financial
      information relating to  parents  will  be  required  only  where  the
      applicant is financially dependent on their  parents.   The  following
      must be taken into account:
      . income:
           - from employment or self-employment
           - from non-employment sources
           - of the applicant's spouse or partner (as  well  as  any  other
      adult with whom  the  applicant  lives  and  from  whom  they  receive
      financial support) or parents from employment or other sources
           - from welfare benefits or tax credits received by the applicant
      or their spouse or partner (as well as any other adult with  whom  the
      applicant lives and from  whom  they  receive  financial  support)  or
      parents
           - from other family or friends
      . assets:
           - cash
           - money held in bank and building  society  accounts  (including
      non-UK  based  accounts),  including   accounts   belonging   to   the
      applicant's spouse or partner (as well as any other  adult  with  whom
      the applicant lives and from whom  they  receive  financial  support),
      parents or children
           -  investments,  including  any  investments  belonging  to  the
      applicant's spouse or partner (as well as any other  adult  with  whom
      the applicant lives and from whom  they  receive  financial  support),
      parents or children
           - land or property
           - cars or other vehicles
           - goods held for the purpose of a trade or other business
           -  jewellery  (except  for  wedding  jewellery   such   as   the
      applicant's engagement and wedding rings)
           - other personal possessions, such as mobile phones,  computers"
      (at p.19)


      "Support provided to the applicant or a  dependent  family  member  by
      family or friends must be considered in  assessing  their  income  and
      outgoings. Such support could be financial or in  terms  of  providing
      accommodation  or  meeting  other  essential  living  needs,  such  as
      providing food or paying bills.  If  this  support  is  of  a  limited
      duration or is about  to  end,  the  applicant  must  provide  a  full
      explanation of  why  this  is  so,  along  with  relevant  documentary
      evidence. An example of the sort of documentary evidence  which  could
      be provided might include a signed statement from the person  who  has
      been providing them with support or accommodation explaining why  they
      are no longer able to do so. Documentary  evidence  of  that  person's
      financial situation showing the  support  provided,  such  as  regular
      payments to the applicant's bank account, and demonstrating  that  the
      person's financial circumstances have changed such  that  they  cannot
      continue to support  or  accommodate  the  applicant  should  also  be
      provided" (at p. 20).


      "If the caseworker is not satisfied the applicant qualifies for a  fee
      waiver then:
      If the applicant made their application in time (for example they  had
      valid leave on the date their application was submitted), they  should
      normally be advised that they do not qualify for a fee waiver and that
      if they wish to validate  their  application,  they  must,  within  10
      working days  either  pay  the  specified  fee  or  submit  additional
      evidence that demonstrates they qualify for a fee waiver. If  the  fee
      is paid within that period or additional evidence is  provided  within
      that period that demonstrates the applicant qualifies for a fee waiver
      and the application meets the other validation criteria, it should  be
      forwarded to the relevant caseworking section  for  consideration.  If
      the applicant provides further evidence within  10  working  days  but
      this does not demonstrate that they qualify  for  a  fee  waiver,  the
      application should be rejected as invalid. If no further  evidence  is
      provided and  the  fee  is  not  paid  within  10  working  days,  the
      application should be rejected as invalid (at p. 23).


  27. I note at the outset that permission was granted on the two grounds in
      the renewal application and that the third ground put forward  by  the
      applicant, that her human  rights  were  breached  by  the  respondent
      refusing to allow her to work, was not pursued either in  the  written
      grounds for renewal or by Mr Jafferji. It was also not argued  at  any
      stage that there were any exceptional  circumstances  which  warranted
      the grant of a fee waiver as per p. 18 of the policy (cited  above  at
      paragraph 26), although the respondent did look  to  consider  whether
      there were any such circumstances when reaching  her  decision  of  17
      December 2018 (AB:21).


  28. I agree with Mr Tabori's submission that the applicant did not make  a
      challenge to the fairness of the policy itself,  nor  would  she  have
      been able to do so in proceedings before the Upper Tribunal. In  those
      circumstances, Mr Jafferji's submission that it was only fair that  an
      applicant should be able to provide  a  response  to  shortcomings  in
      their application, is inappropriate. The policy does not envisage  all
      applicants being able to remedy deficiencies in their applications nor
      does it require the respondent to make  the  nature  of  her  concerns
      known to an applicant.


  29. It is plain  from  the  policy  that  it  is  wholly  the  applicant's
      responsibility to adduce the necessary  evidence  and  information  to
      show that  he/she  qualifies  for  a  fee  waiver.  This  is  repeated
      throughout the 23 pages of guidance. Full details are also given as to
      the  nature  of  the  evidence  sought  and  the  means  by  which  an
      applicant's circumstances may be demonstrated.


  30. The burden on an applicant is further emphasised  in  the  application
      form which states: "The decision on whether  you  qualify  for  a  fee
      waiver will be made on the basis of the  information  you  provide  in
      this  form  and  the  evidence  submitted  with   it.   It   is   your
      responsibility to  provide  sufficient  information  and  evidence  to
      demonstrate that you qualify  for  a  fee  waiver"  (added  emphasis).
      Examples are then given of the kind of documentary evidence required.


  31. The applicant provided two documents; bank  statements  for  a  Lloyds
      account and a letter from Mr Ayaz, the father of her children. She was
      the only applicant and the application was made on the basis that  she
      was destitute, not that she would be rendered destitute by payment  of
      the fee (AB:26). She did not, however, give reasons why  she  believed
      she was destitute. She stated she was single and gave details  of  two
      children born in the UK in  November  2012  and  November  2014,  both
      British citizens. Her address was given as 74  Victoria  Avenue,  East
      Ham, where she said she had lived since December  2017.  The  Tribunal
      was, however, informed on 27 March 2019 that  she  had  moved  to  65A
      Grangewood Street, East Ham and then on 26 July 2019 to an address  in
      Luton. The Grangewood address is also where Mr Ayaz  resides  (AB:  62
      and 68).


  32. On her application  form,  the  applicant  claimed  to  be  living  in
      accommodation provided by  a  friend.  Section  4.11  which  requested
      details of each person, including children, who lived  with  her,  was
      left blank (AB:32-3). It has not been clarified whether  the  children
      live with her or somewhere else. At s.5.1 and 5.2 she stated that  her
      children's father had been supporting her but that this had  decreased
      from �400 per month to �250, although at 5.5 she maintained  that  she
      received �200 (AB:35). She failed to tick the section on holding  bank
      or building society accounts (at 5.7) although at 5.11 she referred to
      having an account with Lloyds Bank. At s.9 she confirmed she  received
      �250 per month (in a letter dated 26 July 2019, sent to  the  Tribunal
      with the applicant's application for renewal and for a fee  remission,
      Mr Ayaz states that he provides the applicant with �200 a month and is
      responsible for her food  shopping).  There  was  no  mention  of  any
      receipt of child benefit which  she  would  be  entitled  to  for  her
      British children. Her outgoings were said to amount to �235  including
      �40 for a mobile phone.


  33. On 27 November 2018 the applicant received email  correspondence  from
      the respondent. As this is a crucial document for the purposes of this
      claim, I reproduce it below.


Dear Ms Tallat

Re. Bushra Tallat. Pakistan 18 October 1989 24542193



Please note a reply is required by 11 December 2018



We have received your request for a fee waiver but we require further
information or evidence to assess your claim. Please provide the
documentation below by scanning it in and sending it to this email address
by 11 December 2018.



Alternatively, you can send it by post to:

......

Evidence required:

Six months annotated bank statements for all bank accounts

Information from the Equifax credit agency shows that you have Halifax
account *361 and Santander account *714 which you have not provided
statements for as part of your application. Please provide at least six
months of statements for accounts *361 and *714, running up to present.
These need to be sent by the bank on letter headed paper or stamped as
genuine by the bank in-branch. Alongside your statements please provide an
explanation for all major incoming and outcoming payments and how they
relate to your essential living needs, accommodation or to your claimed
exceptional circumstances.



Please also provide any further information or evidence you have that you
feel may assist the assessment including any financial, accommodation or
other issues that may be occurring due to your current circumstances.



  34. On 10 December 2018 the applicant replied. She offered  apologies  for
      having forgotten about the other two accounts.  One  was  said  to  be
      inactive; the other was being used by Mr Ayaz for receipt  of  a  loan
      and subsequent withdrawals. Letters from him and from the  person  who
      made the loan were provided.


  35. On 17 December 2018, the respondent wrote to the appellant  to  notify
      her that her application for a fee waiver had been  refused.  She  was
      given ten working days to pay the fee  and  informed  that  her  human
      rights application would otherwise be rejected as invalid.


  36. On 27 December 2018 the applicant emailed the  respondent.  She  cited
      the policy and complained that the decision was contrary to the policy
      and that the respondent "never  set  out  what  documents  I  need  to
      provide in relation  to  my  fee  remission  (sic)  application".  She
      maintained that she should be given ten working days to supply further
      evidence. She then  proceeded  to  provide  further  information.  She
      stated that she had been unable to  obtain  any  evidence  as  to  the
      suitability of her accommodation, that she had provided a letter  from
      her "lodger" confirming her circumstances (this letter is not included
      in the bundle  and  the  reference  to  lodger  is  unclear)  and  she
      maintained that even if her accommodation was  sufficient,  she  could
      not provide for her essential needs without her friend's support  (but
      no details of the nature of the  support  given  were  provided).  She
      repeated the earlier  information  about  the  loan  to  Mr  Ayaz  and
      attached a further (unsigned) letter from him.  The fee was not paid.


  37. On 2 January 2019 the respondent rejected her application  as  invalid
      due to the non- payment of the fee.


  38.  I have considered the policy carefully and as the crux of the case is
      whether the correspondence of 27 November 2018  follows  the  scenario
      set out at p. 14 of the policy or that at p. 23, I have also carefully
      considered that document.


  39. The first part of the policy is set out at paragraph 24  above.  After
      emphasising that the responsibility lies with an applicant to  provide
      the evidence that they qualify for a  fee  waiver,  it  suggests  that
      "caseworkers should not normally make additional enquiries to try  and
      establish whether  an  applicant  qualifies  for  a  fee  waiver".  It
      provides, however, for certain circumstances  in  which  an  applicant
      "may be requested to provide a missing document (or part  of  one)  to
      which the fee waiver application refers".  This  is  the  scenario  Mr
      Jafferji argued applied in the present  case  and  which  led  to  the
      correspondence of  27  November.  I  am  unable  to  agree  with  that
      submission. The respondent's checks  revealed  two  bank  accounts  to
      which the applicant had made no reference  in  her  application.  She,
      therefore, gave the applicant an opportunity to explain  this  and  to
      provide specified further evidence as well as any other  evidence  the
      applicant considered might assist.  She was given ten working days  to
      do so. This was not a request for "a missing document (or part of one)
      to which the fee waiver application refers".  I agree with Mr Tabori's
      submission that it would be illogical for the respondent to  treat  an
      applicant who genuinely omitted to include a document  or  part  of  a
      sequence of documents referred to in the application in the  same  way
      as one who concealed or failed to disclose matters. I also  note  that
      although a specific request was made for  annotated  bank  statements,
      the  statements  submitted  bore  no  annotations  and  many  of   the
      transactions therein were unexplained by Mr Ayaz's letter.  There  was
      also no explanation for the transactions  which  occurred  before  the
      alleged loan to Mr Ayaz was paid into the applicant's Halifax  account
      (AB:57-58).


  40. Alternatively, if it was the case that the respondent was only seeking
      further information given what her checks revealed, there is still  no
      impropriety in her decision  to  proceed  to  refuse  the  application
      forthwith because the policy does not make it  mandatory  for  her  to
      give the applicant an opportunity to respond to any concerns raised by
      the evidence.


  41. It seems to me, however, that the scenario set  out  at  p.23  of  the
      policy is  more  likely  to  be  the  case.  The  applicant  made  her
      application in time, the caseworker was plainly dissatisfied with  the
      information and evidence she had provided and  gave  her  ten  working
      days to rectify the shortcomings. The applicant was put on notice that
      her application could not succeed on the basis of the information  she
      had provided, and she was given the opportunity not  only  to  provide
      evidence the respondent specifically considered to be  necessary,  but
      also anything else she might want to adduce. This was her  opportunity
      to remedy the deficiencies in her application and she failed to do so.
      The policy does not require the respondent to  give  her  yet  another
      chance; indeed,  she  was  fortunate  to  have  even  been  given  one
      opportunity as it is not mandatory for  the  respondent  to  seek  any
      further information. That is made abundantly clear many times over  in
      the policy. Nor is there any requirement for the  respondent  to  give
      reasons for why she chooses to exercise discretion in some  cases  and
      not in others. Despite the contention in the renewed grounds  that  it
      is not accepted that the policy is in discretionary terms (at 22),  Mr
      Jafferji, in his submissions, accepted that it was and that is clearly
      the case. I consider that the applicant is being particularly pedantic
      in her criticism of the working of the 27 November correspondence.


  42. Once the first complaint falls away, the second, which is  reliant  on
      the first argument, cannot succeed. There was no requirement  for  the
      respondent to seek any further evidence or to offer the  applicant  an
      opportunity to respond to any concerns  or  to  consider  the  further
      information and evidence offered.


  43. Whilst Mr Jafferji submitted that the deficiencies of the  application
      were not a matter for this court, it has to be said that the  evidence
      the applicant has provided  throughout  these  proceedings,  including
      that which was not considered by  the  respondent,  in  no  way  shows
      destitution. The applicant has always had free accommodation, has  not
      been at risk of being homeless, has had sufficient funds to  meet  her
      daily needs and those of her children, including being able to  afford
      a mobile phone and has funds left over at the end of the month.


  44. The respondent complied with the policy and the decisions disclose  no
      public law errors. There is no requirement for repeated  opportunities
      for explanation and submission of documents. The expectation  is  that
      applicants should provide all relevant information  at  the  time  the
      application is made. The offer of a 'second chance' is not mandatory.


  45. The respondent considered the best interests of the  children  in  her
      decision (AB:21).



  46. For all these reasons,  I  therefore  conclude  that  the  applicant's
      challenge cannot succeed.


      Costs


  47. I have considered paragraph 10(7)(b) of the Upper  Tribunal  Procedure
      Rules 2008 and the applicant's submissions on costs. I note her  claim
      of a lack of financial ability to pay the costs, but she has had legal
      representation and there is no suggestion in the submissions that  the
      services of Counsel were pro bono. Moreover, the applicant would  have
      been aware when pursuing the challenge that she could  be  liable  for
      costs if she lost. Having considered all the circumstances, and noting
      that  the  applicant  has  been  granted  fee  remissions   in   these
      proceedings, I order that the applicant shall pay  �2000  towards  the
      respondent's costs of �4689.


Permission to appeal

  48. The applicant seeks permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal on the
      basis that the Upper Tribunal arguably erred in  concluding  that  the
      respondent had acted  in  accordance  with  her  policy  and  finding,
      therefore, that there was no  public  law  error  in  her  failure  to
      consider the applicant's representations of 27 December 2018 prior  to
      making her decision to invalidate the application.


  49. These matters, being the  core  of  the  applicant's  challenge,  have
      already been considered at length in the Tribunal's judgment. For  the
      reasons given therein, no arguable error has been identified.
