                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr J Gajjar, MYM Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Everett, a Senior Home Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal L Murray promulgated on  9th  October  2018  following  a
    hearing at Columbus House in Newport on 24th September 2018.

 2. At the appeal hearing before  me  today  in  the  Upper  Tribunal,  the
    Claimant has been represented by Mr Gajjar of Counsel and the Secretary
    of State has been represented by Ms Everett, the Senior Home Presenting
    Officer.

 3. Although Mr Afzal and Mrs Shafique were the Appellants before the First-
    tier Tribunal, as this is the  Secretary  of  State's  appeal  for  the
    purposes of clarity in this decision I will refer to Mr Afzal  and  Mrs
    Shafique as 'the Claimants' and  to  the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
    'Respondent' or 'the Secretary of State', so it is clear given that the
    Secretary of State is the Appellant before the Upper Tribunal, so there
    is no confusion.

 4. The Claimants are husband and wife and although  Mrs  Shafique  made  a
    separate application and she has  a  separate  appeal  number,  it  was
    agreed by the Respondent at the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal
    that effectively her appeal was dependent upon that of her husband,  Mr
    Afzal, and that if his appeal succeeded so did hers.

 5. At the First-tier Tribunal it was found that Mr Afzal's application for
    leave to remain under paragraph 276B of the Immigration  Rules  on  the
    basis of long residence, was refused by the Secretary of State pursuant
    to a consideration of paragraph 322(5)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  as
    amended, on the basis that a ground upon  which  leave  to  remain,  or
    variation of leave to remain, in the United Kingdom should normally  be
    refused under subparagraph (v) is 'the undesirability of permitting the
    person concerned to remain in the United Kingdom in the  light  of  his
    conduct (including convictions  which  do  not  fall  within  paragraph
    322(1C), character or associations or the fact  that  he  represents  a
    threat to national security.'  The Respondent considered it undesirable
    for him to remain in the United Kingdom because it was considered  that
    he had been deceitful or dishonest in his dealings with HMRC by failing
    to declare his claimed income or earnings, by falsely representing  his
    income in order to obtain leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

 6. Judge Murray when setting  out  the  application  reasons  for  refusal
    letter went on to state that the  information  that  the  Claimant  had
    included with his previous Tier 1 applications was  compared  with  the
    information provided by HMRC regarding earnings he declared to them for
    the tax years 2009 to 2010, 2010 to 2011, and 2012  to  2013.   He  had
    submitted a Tier 1 application for leave to remain  on  the  31st  June
    2011.  In this application he declared earnings  of  �37,987  over  the
    period from 11 March 2010 to 10 March 2011 and he  was  awarded  points
    based on this  income.   He  claimed  that  these  earnings  were  from
    salaried employment of �6000 for the period 31st January 2011  to  28th
    February 2011 and self-employed earnings of �31,987 for the  period  11
    of March 2010 to 10 March 2011.  HMRC  data  showed  that  he  filed  a
    2009/2010 tax return in which he declared �13,108  in  earnings  and  a
    2010/11 tax return on which he declared �12,847 in earnings.  HMRC data
    showed that he declared on his self-assessment tax return  for  2009/10
    filed on 27 January 2011 that he had a turnover of �2175 and a loss  of
    �2210.  On 3 February 2011 he received a self-assessment  repayment  of
    �425.43.

 7. In the original refusal it was stated that according to the information
    he had provided to HMRC over both tax years of 2009/10 and  2010/11  Mr
    Afzal declared a total earning of �25,955, but had declared earnings of
    �37,987 for the 12 months from 11 March 2010 to 10 March 2011  when  he
    applied for further leave to remain.   It  was  stated  that  it  would
    therefore be impossible for him to have had a turnover  and  profit  as
    claimed.

 8. Mr Afzal submitted a Tier 1 general application for leave to remain  on
    18 June 2013.  In this application he claimed  �38,414.24  in  earnings
    over the period from 1 August 2012  to  31st  March  2013  and  he  was
    awarded points based on this income.  He claimed  that  these  earnings
    were from salaried employment with Islamic Relief of �15,242 and  Marks
    & Spencer of �5450.  He also claimed  to  have  received  dividends  of
    �17,221 during the period 1st August 2012 to 31st of March  2013  which
    fell into the financial year 2012 to 2013.  HMRC's data  show  that  he
    filed a 2012 -  2013  tax  return  in  which  he  declared  �20,692  in
    earnings.  According to the information he had provided to HMRC for the
    tax year 2012 to 2013 he declared a total of �20,692, but had  declared
    earnings of �38,414.24 for a further eight months from 1 August 2012 to
    31 March 2013 when he applied for further leave to remain.   HMRC  data
    showed that he received dividends of �17,721 in the following tax  year
    of 2013/14.  However, there was no  record  that  he  had  declared  an
    income from dividends to HMRC for the financial year 2012 - 2013.

 9. The Secretary of State acknowledged  that  paragraph  322  (5)  of  the
    Immigration Rules was not a mandatory  refusal,  however  the  evidence
    submitted did  not  satisfactorily  demonstrate  that  the  failure  to
    declare to HMRC at the time his self-employed earnings declared on  the
    previous application for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  as  a
    Tier 1 Migrant was a genuine error.  It was noted that there would have
    been a clear benefit to Mr Afzal either by failing to declare his  full
    earnings to HMRC with respect to  reducing  his  tax  liability  or  by
    falsely representing his earnings to UK Visas and Immigration to enable
    him to meet the points required to obtain leave in the  United  Kingdom
    as a Tier 1 migrant.  It was therefore concluded by  the  Secretary  of
    State that he did not meet paragraph 276B (ii) (c) of  the  immigration
    rules and his application for indefinite leave to remain on the grounds
    of long residence was therefore refused.

10. Judge Murray when considering the Claimants' appeal noted that he heard
    evidence from both Claimants  and  went  on  in  his  findings  between
    paragraphs 17 and 35 to make findings  in  respect  of  the  Claimants'
    appeal.  The  judge  quite  properly  considered  the  situation  under
    paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules, that being  the  basis  upon
    which the Secretary of State refused the Claimants' application.

11. The judge noted  at  paragraphs  22  and  23  that  in  coming  to  his
    conclusions he had to consider whether or not the Claimant had employed
    dishonesty or deception and that such a refusal would not be based upon
    genuine mistakes.

12. The judge stated at paragraph 26 that  the  Claimant  relies  upon  two
    letters from his accountants to  support  his  case  that  he  had  not
    employed dishonesty or deception in  relation  to  his  declaration  of
    earnings to HMRC.  The first was the letter at page 53  of  his  bundle
    dated 1 May 2018.  The judge stated:

         "26. ... First Accountancy Ltd, state that they confirmed that they
             were acting  as  his  accountants  and  were  responsible  for
             preparing and filing his self-assessment tax returns  for  the
             years 2012/13 and  2013/14.   They  state  that  during  these
             years, the Appellant was  director  and  sole  shareholder  of
             Techno Consultancy Ltd.  They state  that  Techno  Consultancy
             Ltd had its financial year ending  on  31  July,  which  would
             overlap with the personal tax year of the Appellant, since the
             tax year for self-assessment closes on 5 April.  Any dividends
             paid up to 31 July of a calendar year will be declared in  the
             tax return of the following year.  They state  that  therefore
             dividends paid to the Appellant from  Techno  Consultancy  Ltd
             during the financial year from 9 July 2012  to  31  July  2013
             were declared in his self-assessment for the tax year  2013/14
             and not 2012/13.  They further state that to the best of their
             knowledge and belief, this treatment is correct in declaring a
             dividend in either tax year and will not have  given  any  tax
             relief to the Appellant.  They also confirm  that  during  the
             dealings with him they had found him honest and trustworthy.

         27.  The second letter from the Appellant's accountants is at  page
             54 of his bundle and is dated 15 May 2018.  In this letter his
             accountants state they write to clarify matters pertaining  to
             his self-assessment tax return for  the  year  2010  to  2011.
             They state that they were appointed his  accountants  for  the
             year ending 5 April 2013 and  had  been  responsible  for  the
             filing of his  self-assessments  since  their  appointment  to
             date.  In February 2016, the Appellant asked  to  provide  all
             the records for the last six years in order to  make  his  ILR
             application.  Upon reviewing his tax records for the last  six
             years they discovered that his self-assessment income had been
             omitted from his  self-assessment  tax  return  for  the  year
             2010/2011.   They  therefore  informed   the   Appellant   and
             suggested he file an amended tax  return  for  the  year  with
             HMRC.  They also wrote to his previous  accountants  who  were
             responsible for preparing and filing his  self-assessment  tax
             returns in that period to enquire about that omission but they
             had not received any response.  Upon  receiving  instructions,
             they identified and rectified under sections 29 and 36 of  the
             Taxes Amendments Act 1970 without imposition of any  penalties
             for him for the tax year 2010/2011 and on 16  May  2016  which
             included his self-assessment income of �31,987.  This  amended
             tax return was accepted by HMRC and  the  Appellant  paid  any
             outstanding taxes immediately.   His  accountants  state  that
             they believe the omission was genuine on his part and they had
             been acting for him for the last number of years and  believed
             he was an upright and law-abiding person.

         28.  The Appellant has produced the letters from HMRC dated 15 June
             2016 to confirm that his tax return for the year ended 5 April
             2011 was amended on 19 May 2016.  The letter states  that  the
             Appellant did not send the amendment at  the  right  time  and
             they viewed this as a failure to take reasonable care with his
             tax affairs for the period.   This  meant  that  he  had  more
             income tax to pay.  They had made an  assessment  and  updated
             his self-assessment statement to include this.  As of 15  June
             2016 his self-assessment statement showed that he was  due  to
             pay a total of �2480.99 which included the additional tax  due
             on their assessment.  At page 58 of the Appellant's bundle  is
             a further letter informing him of the liability  to  pay  tax.
             According to the Appellant's accountant he paid the imposition
             of outstanding taxes immediately. "

13. The judge went on in paragraph 29 to say that the  Respondent  has  not
    suggested that the Claimant has not paid any tax that he is  owing  and
    the judge found that  HMRC  had  taken  no  further  action  after  the
    Claimant had  amended  his  tax  return.   The  judge  found  that  the
    Claimant's accountant's letters fully explained why there were  seeming
    inconsistencies in both the 2012/13 and 2013/14 years, namely the  fact
    that dividends were paid or declared in the tax return of the following
    year and that in relation to the tax years 2010/11 the Claimant's self-
    assessment income had  been  omitted  from  his  tax  return,  but  his
    representatives acted immediately to correct  the  error  when  it  was
    discovered.

14. The judge stated, the fact that no further action was taken against the
    Claimant was strong evidence it was not considered that any  fraud  had
    been committed.  The judge said it was  also  clear  that  his  present
    accountants took steps to find out from his  previous  accountants  why
    this income had been omitted  from  his  previous  tax  return  but  no
    response was made.

15. The judge acknowledged that whilst it is true  that  the  Claimant  was
    ultimately responsible for the information on his tax  return,  he  was
    acting under the instruction and advice of professionals and the  judge
    stated he considered it to be of relevance that his current accountants
    have been unable to obtain a response  from  his  previous  accountant.
    The judge therefore found that Mr Afzal had made an honest and  genuine
    mistake which has subsequently been corrected and all monies  paid  due
    and that account was plausible and supported by documentation both from
    HMRC and the accountants.  The  judge  found  that  it  was  a  genuine
    mistake and that he had not  used  deception  or  dishonesty  with  his
    dealings with HMRC or the Home Office and that there is nothing in  his
    conduct,  character,  associations  or  otherwise  which  rendered   it
    undesirable for him to remain in the United Kingdom.

16. The Secretary of State seeks to appeal against that  decision  for  the
    reasons set out within the Grounds  of  Appeal.   That  document  is  a
    matter of record and therefore I do not intend to read it  out  in  its
    entirety but in summary, it is  argued  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge made a material misdirection in law.

17. At paragraph 1 it is argued the Tribunal erred in taking  into  account
    that no penalty  had  been  imposed  by  HMRC  and  that  the  ultimate
    responsibility for the tax return lies with  the  taxpayer  and  it  is
    argued that the Tribunal deviated from the appropriate way of assessing
    such circumstances and that the Judge should have  had  regard  to  the
    judicial review cases of Samant JR/6546/2016 and  Abbasi  JR/13807/2016
    in which it was said that findings which make findings relating to  the
    relevance of the actions that the HMRC  take  against  Claimants.   The
    quotation is made from paragraph 22 of Samant which states:

         "The difficulty again here is that we have  no  evidence  from  the
         Revenue as to whether they did consider the question of penalty  or
         what steps, if any, they decided to take and the reasons  why  they
         decided as they did.  It, in my judgement, cannot be  assumed  that
         in every case, having regard to what one knows to be the  pressures
         on HMRC, that they would have gone through the exercise that  maybe
         they should have gone through, and decided that they were satisfied
         that there was not even carelessness.  It seems to me that  in  any
         given  case,  depending  on   the   amounts,   depending   on   the
         circumstances, HMRC may well decide that  the  effort  in  reaching
         particular  conclusions  frankly  is  not  justified  in  all   the
         circumstances.  I am afraid that I do not think that the fact  that
         HMRC has decided not to take further action can indicate  that  the
         decision of the Secretary of State is one which was irrational."

    Paragraph 75 of Abbasi was quoted in which it was stated:

         "That HMRC has not yet seen fit to issue penalty notice is  neither
         here nor there.  No doubt HMRC has leeway within which to  issue  a
         penalty notice or institute proceedings and time would  only  start
         running when the declaration was made in late 2015.   (I  note  the
         letters to HMRC were undated).  In any event what the HMRC does  or
         does not do is not necessarily relevant to actions by the Secretary
         of State in deciding applications for indefinite leave to remain."

    In the Grounds of Appeal the Secretary of State  argued  that  if  that
    approach had been adopted then the Tribunal  would  have  decided  that
    action or inaction by HMRC was  of  no  relevance  to  the  immigration
    matter and that the Claimant is responsible for his own tax affairs and
    that cannot be passed to the accountant.   It  was  further  argued  in
    paragraph 5, there was a gap in the evidence and there is  no  evidence
    to support the assertions that the Claimants  had  made  regarding  his
    previous accountants and there is nothing  from  those  accountants  to
    assist the Claimant and that the evidence from his new  accountant  was
    not tested by cross-examination.

18. In paragraph 6  of  the  grounds  it  is  argued  that  ultimately  the
    liability for handling errors rests with the Claimant who is ultimately
    responsible for the tax declaration and that he should have  reasonably
    suspected that he was not declaring the right amount  given  that  HMRC
    had paid him money, given that he conducted  his  business  at  a  loss
    rather than the amount he declared to UKVI for the benefit of  his  ILR
    application. The duration of the errors, it is argued, do  not  support
    the Tribunal's finding of an innocent mistake.  It is argued that given
    the sums involved and timing of the efforts to rectify the errors,  the
    application of paragraph 322(5) was quite proper and the Tribunal erred
    in not pursuing this approach.

19. Permission to appeal in this case was granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Keith on 14th December 2018 who noted that  following  the  Upper
    Tribunal decision in the case of    R  (on  the  application  of  Khan)
    (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC) that
    for an Claimant to blame his or her accountant will not be  an  end  to
    the matter and that the Claimant will have known of their earnings,  so
    that where  an  Applicant  does  not  remedy  the  situation  within  a
    reasonable time that may allow a conclusion of  deceit  or  dishonesty.
    It was said that the decision may disclose an arguable error of law  or
    a chance of the judge taking account of the irrelevant matters or as to
    how the conclusion on delay impacted upon the  Claimants'  credibility.
    Permission to appeal on both grounds was given.

20. I am most grateful to the helpful submissions of  both  Ms  Everett  on
    behalf of the Secretary of State and also Mr Gajjar on  behalf  of  the
    Claimants which I have fully taken account of in reaching my  decision,
    which are recorded within the Record of Proceedings although I refer to
    the relevant parts of any of those submissions when making my findings.



My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

21. Although in this case the Secretary of State seeks to  rely  upon  both
    the cases of Samant JR/6546/2016 and Abbasi  JR/13807/2016  and  quotes
    paragraph 22 of Samant and paragraph 75 of Abbasi, both of those  cases
    were judicial review cases rather than statutory  appeals,  but  as  Mr
    Gajjar on behalf of the Claimants quite correctly  points  out  and  is
    also quite properly conceded by Ms Everett on behalf of  the  Secretary
    of State, those cases were dealing with the question of rationality  in
    terms of whether or not it was irrational for the Home Office  to  look
    beyond whether or not HMRC had imposed a penalty or not. The  Secretary
    of State was, in those cases, found not to be irrational  in  terms  of
    looking beyond a simple failure to impose a penalty or whether  penalty
    had been imposed.  In Samant Mr Justice Collins made  the  point  there
    that there was  no  evidence  from  the  Revenue  as  to  whether  they
    considered the question of penalty or what steps, if any, they  decided
    to take and the reasons why they decided as they did.  He said  'In  my
    judgment, it cannot be assumed that in every  case,  having  regard  to
    what one knows to be the  pressures  on  HMRC,  they  would  have  gone
    through the exercise that maybe they have  gone  through,  and  decided
    that they were satisfied that there was not even carelessness' at [22].
    The Court in Abbasi made the point at [75] that what HMRC does or  does
    not do is not necessarily relevant to actions by the Secretary of State
    in deciding applications for indefinite  leave  to  remain.   But  what
    those cases were saying was that  the  question  as  to  whether  or  a
    penalty was imposed is not determinative of  the  application  in  that
    case, or in this case, the appeal.

22. The fact that it was found that the Secretary of State was  not  acting
    irrationally in terms of not simply relying  upon  whether  penalty  is
    imposed does not mean, as argued in  paragraph  4  of  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal, that the question of imposition of a penalty  or  otherwise  is
    irrelevant to the immigration matter has not relevance.  Quite clearly,
    as properly conceded by Ms Everett, had there been  a  penalty  imposed
    that is something that the Secretary of State herself would have wanted
    to rely upon in saying that this was in evidence of dishonesty.

23. But unlike in the Samant case, in the case of these two Claimants,  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge quite properly made  reference  to  a  letter
    from HMRC to Mr Afzal dated 15th June 2016 in which the HMRC stated:

         "Your amendment to your tax return for the  year  ended  5th  April
         2011 should have been with us by 31st January, twelve months  after
         the end of the tax year to  which  the  tax  return  relates.   For
         example the amendments to the 2011/12 tax return should  have  been
         received by us by 31st January 2014.

         However we did not receive this amendment until 19th May 2016.  You
         did not send us your amendment at the right time.  We view this  as
         a failure to take reasonable care with your  tax  affairs  for  the
         above period.  You have more income tax to pay."

    The Judge went on to find that there was actually additional tax to pay
    totalling �2,480.99.  Unlike in Abbasi,  in  this  case  the  HMRC  has
    provided evidence in that letter as to what their view as to  the  late
    amendment to that tax return was, namely that it was a failure to  take
    reasonable care with his tax affairs for the above period by Mr  Afzal.
    Quite clearly, that in itself is not determinative of  the  matter  and
    the judge had to consider all of the evidence in the round,  which  the
    Judge did in this case, but it was evidence the judge was  entitled  to
    take into account. That clearly is relevant evidence.   The  suggestion
    from the Secretary of State that it should have been ignored, is in  my
    judgment, simply wrong.

24. The Secretary of State goes on to argue that  there  are  gaps  in  the
    evidence and  although  the  Claimant  sought  to  blame  his  previous
    accountants and tax advisors,  there  was  no  evidence  from  them  in
    support of his assertions and that is was said that he had visited  the
    accountant's previous office had been unable locate their  new  offices
    and there was nothing from the accountants to assist the Claimant.   In
    that regard, it is true that there was no evidence  from  the  previous
    accountant, but the judge did take that into account.  At paragraph  27
    of the judgment the judge noted that the new accountants had written to
    the previous accountants who were responsible for preparing and  filing
    his self-assessment tax returns in the period and to enquire about that
    omission, but they had not received any response.  The judge again also
    noted that responsibility for paying the taxes and for getting the  tax
    returns correct lay with the Claimant. However, the  Judge  heard  from
    the Claimants and considered  the  evidence  before  the  Tribunal  and
    accepted the explanations for the seeming inconsistencies. It is not an
    error of law for a Tribunal  to  believe  a  Claimant.  The  Judge  was
    entitled to accept the explanations on the evidence available.

25. In this case the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  has  made  clear  findings
    which  are  cogent  and  well-reasoned,  that   in   respect   of   the
    discrepancies for one of the tax  years  that  that  resulted  for  the
    2012/13 and 2013/14 years that that resulted from  an  overlap  of  the
    dividends payable with the financial year for  Techno  Consultancy  Ltd
    ending on 31st July, which would overlap with the personal tax for  the
    Claimant, as the tax year for self-assessment closed on 5th April.

26. In respect of the other discrepancy in  terms  of  the  self-assessment
    income having been omitted from the self-assessment tax return for  the
    year 2010/11 the judge  found  that  once  that  discrepancy  had  been
    spotted by the Claimants' new accountants that the amended  tax  return
    was filed and that  the  Claimant  had  paid  the  tax  due  and  owing
    immediately upon the tax returning being accepted by HMRC.   The  judge
    accepted that effectively these were innocent  mistakes  and  that  the
    Claimant Mr Afzal had  not  exercised  dishonesty  in  respect  of  his
    dealings with the Home Office or HMRC and that it was a genuine mistake
    on his part.  In my judgment those were findings open to the  judge  on
    the evidence in this case.

27. Although Ms Everett quite properly argues that obviously  there  was  a
    long delay before the amended tax return  was  put  in,  obviously  the
    Judge has taken account of that delay, as also did the HMRC authorities
    when noting that there had been that  delay  in  terms  of  the  period
    between the 31st January 2014 when any amendments to the 2011/2012  tax
    return should have received by them in the time that they actually  did
    receive that amendment in 2016.  The judge was entitled to consider the
    fact that the HMRC themselves had not found that was dishonest but  was
    simply a failure to take reasonable care  by  Mr  Afzal  with  his  tax
    information.  The judge has considered the question of  dishonesty  and
    deception and has  given  clear,  cogent  and  sufficient  reasons  for
    finding that this was an innocent mistake.

28. The Upper Tribunal decision in the case of R  (on  the  application  of
    Khan) (Dishonesty, tax return,  paragraph  322(5))  [2018]  UKUT  00384
    (IAC) clearly states that the fact that whether  or  not  an  Appellant
    seeks to blame his or her accountant will not be the end of the  matter
    and that failure to remedy the situation within a reasonable  time  may
    allow a conclusion of deceit or dishonesty, however it is not authority
    that it has to be treated as deceit  or  dishonesty.   It  is  still  a
    matter for the judge having considered the evidence  and  having  heard
    from the witnesses including in this case the two Claimants  themselves
    as to whether dishonesty had been exercised.  The case of Khan  is  not
    authority for the fact that delay in and of  itself  is  conclusive  on
    that issue.  The  judge  had  the  benefit  of  hearing  from  the  two
    Claimants and made findings on credibility and their honesty which were
    open to him on the evidence.

29. In those circumstances the decision of First-tier Tribunal Murray  does
    not disclose  any  material  error  of  law  and  is  maintained.   The
    Secretary of State's appeal is therefore dismissed.

Notice of Decision

30. The decision of First-tier Tribunal Murray does not contain a  material
    error of law and is maintained.  The Secretary  of  State's  appeal  is
    dismissed.

31. The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not direct there to be any  anonymity
    direction and no such  direction  has  been  sought  before  me  and  I
    therefore do not order anonymity in this case.
