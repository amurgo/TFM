Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Whitwell
For the Respondent:    No Representative


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant in this appeal is the Entry Clearance  Officer  Islamabad
    to whom I shall refer as "the  claimant".   The  respondent  is  Ayesha
    Sarwar, a national of Pakistan who was born on 28th October 2005.

2.   The respondent made  application  for  entry  clearance  to  enter  the
    United Kingdom as a partner under paragraph EC-P.1.1 of Appendix FM  of
    the Immigration Rules, but on  15th  November  2012,  in  refusing  the
    respondent's application, the claimant  said  this  in  the  Notice  of
    Refusal:

         "Your sponsor is not exempt  form  the  financial  requirements  as
         defined by paragraph E-ECP.3.3.  I am not able to take into account
         any potential employment you have available to you in the UK or any
         offers of financial support from third parties.  In order  to  meet
         the financial requirements of the Rules your sponsor's income  from
         self-employment and other income in the last full financial year or
         as an average of the last two full financial years needs to  be  at
         least �18,600 per annum.


         You have said in your Appendix 2 form that your  sponsor  is  self-
         employed as AAT Web Works for eight months and their  gross  income
         before tax in the last full financial year was �29,032.  In respect
         of self-employment in a limited company based in the UK all of  the
         following must be provided:


         a)   Evidence of registration with the registrar  of  companies  at
             Companies House.


         b)   Latest notice to file a company tax return - CT603 and company
             tax return - CT600 (both parts must be supplied).


         c)   The organisation's latest audited annual  accounts  with:  (i)
             the name  of  the  accountant  clearly  shown;  and  (ii)  the
             accountant must be a member of an accredited accounting body.


         d)   Monthly corporate/business bank statements covering  the  same
             twelve month period as the tax return(s).


         e)   Monthly personal bank  statements  covering  the  same  twelve
             month period as the tax return(s) showing that the income from
             self-employment has been paid into an account in the  name  of
             the person or in the name of  the  person  and  their  partner
             jointly.


         f)   Evidence of ongoing self-employment through: (i)  evidence  of
             payment of class 2 national insurance contributions (for self-
             employed persons) or (ii)  current  appointment  reports  from
             Companies House (for directors).


         g)   One of the following documents must also be provided:


             (i)  A certificate of VAT  registration  and  the  latest  VAT
                  return confirming the VAT registration number, if turnover
                  is in excess of �73,000.


             (ii) Proof of ownership or lease of business premises.


             (iii)    Original  proof  of  registration  with  HMRC  as  an
                  employer for the purposes of PAYE and national  insurance,
                  proof  of  PAYE  reference  number  and   account   office
                  reference number.  This reference may be in the form of  a
                  certified copy of documentation issued by HMRC.


             (iv) Proof of registration with the London Stock  Exchange  or
                  with an  international  stock  exchange  approved  by  the
                  Financial Services Authority in the UK.


             These documents are specified  in  the  Immigration  Rules  in
             Appendix FM-SE and must be provided.  You have  not  submitted
             all  of  the  required  documentation  to   demonstrate   your
             sponsor's income as claimed.


             I  therefore  refuse  your  application  under  paragraph  EC-
             P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules."


    That notice of decision is dated 15th November 2012.

3.   The respondent appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and her  appeal  was
    heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Moore, sitting at  Newport  on  18th
    November last year.  In his determination, promulgated on 26th November
    2013,  First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Moore  purported  to   allow   the
    respondent's appeal, to the extent that he purported to "remit  it"  to
    the claimant to consider all the evidence that had been provided by the
    respondent in relation to the  sponsor  and  as  is  contained  in  the
    respondent's bundle, prefaced by the sponsor's witness statement, dated
    8th November 2013.

4.   The claimant challenged the judge's decision,  pointing  out  that  the
    application was refused by the claimant for want of  specific  evidence
    relating to the sponsor's financial circumstances in the  twelve  month
    period up to August 2012.  They point out that the  Tribunal  noted  at
    the hearing  that  some  of  the  required  documents  were  still  not
    available, but that explanations had been provided for their absence.

5.   The specified documents are set out in Appendix FM-SE and set  out  the
    mandatory requirements for the specific evidence  required.   The  fact
    that the specific evidence was not made available, should the challenge
    suggest it, means that the judge should have dismissed the appeal.

6.   At paragraph 21 Judge Moore said this:

         "The [respondent] has listed in extensive detail in  [her]  witness
         statement the documentary  evidence  [she]  provided  in  order  to
         satisfy the evidence required.  I cannot be wholly  satisfied  that
         the [respondent] when submitting the application had  provided  all
         the necessary documents relating to the sponsor and  his  financial
         position and relevant  employment  status.   However,  taking  into
         account the AAT Web Works  Private  Ltd  Report  of  Directors  and
         unaudited financial statements which had not been provided  to  the
         [claimant] at the  time  of  the  application,  together  with  the
         evidence given by the sponsor  at  this  hearing  it  would  be  my
         intention to remit this matter back to the [claimant]  to  consider
         all the evidence."

7.   The judge went on to point out that because  the  company  was  dormant
    until 30th November 2011, the most recent accounting  period  ended  on
    30th November 2012.  The respondent was unable to provide the sponsor's
    last audited annual accounts because the limited company appeared to be
    exempt from having its accounts audited.  No VAT registration documents
    could be provided because the turnover was below the �73,000 limit.

8.   At paragraph 25 the judge said this:

         "The sponsor was unable to provide proof of registration  with  the
         London Stock Exchange since the  company  was  not  listed  on  the
         London Stock Exchange or any other international stock exchange.


         In all the circumstances and due to the particular  nature  of  the
         limited company and the mix  between  the  sponsor's  business  and
         personal bank accounts it might be  the  case  that  the  financial
         requirements under the Rules could be satisfied and indeed may well
         be satisfied with further and closer inspection  of  all  the  bank
         statements both business and personal."

9.   The judge appeared to accept, therefore, that  the  documents  required
    by Appendix FM-SE had  not  been  submitted  to  the  claimant  by  the
    respondent with the application.  In those circumstances the judge  had
    no alternative but to dismiss the respondent's appeal.

10.  It is often the case that judges purport to "remit back"  decisions  to
    the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  or  Entry  Clearance
    Officer.  There is, however, no power for an Immigration Judge to remit
    back a case to the Secretary of State or to an Entry Clearance Officer.
     There is power however, where the Secretary of State's decision or the
    decision of the Entry Clearance Officer is not in accordance  with  the
    law, and that is to allow an appeal to the extent that it  is  for  the
    Secretary of State or the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to  consider  the
    matter again in the light of findings of fact made by the judge.

11.  For all these reasons I find that First-tier Tribunal Judge  Moore  did
    err in law in his determination which I set aside.  My decision is that
    the respondent's appeal against the decision of the claimant  taken  on
    15th November 2012 to refuse the  respondent's  application  for  entry
    clearance be dismissed.
