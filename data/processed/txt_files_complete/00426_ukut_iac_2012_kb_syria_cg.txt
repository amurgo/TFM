Advocates

    a.   This country guidance  replaces  previous  guidance  in  SA  &  IA
       (Undocumented Kurds) Syria CG [2009] UKAIT 00006.


    b.   In the context of the extremely high level of human rights  abuses
       currently occurring in Syria, a regime  which  appears  increasingly
       concerned to crush any sign of  resistance,  it  is  likely  that  a
       failed asylum seeker  or  forced  returnee  would,  in  general,  on
       arrival face a real risk of arrest  and  detention  and  of  serious
       mistreatment during that detention as a result of imputed  political
       opinion. That is sufficient to qualify for refugee  protection.  The
       position  might  be  otherwise  in  the   case   of   someone   who,
       notwithstanding a failed claim for asylum, would still be  perceived
       on return to Syria as a supporter of the Assad regime.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal was heard by the above named panel on 6 and 7  March  2012.
    Upper Tribunal Judge McKee became unavailable as a result of which  the
    hearing on 7 August 2012 was presided over  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judges
    Eshun and Pitt. This is a decision of the two remaining members of  the
    panel, to which both contributed.

 2. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a determination  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Canavan), allowing an appeal by a Syrian
    national (of Arab ethnicity and hailing from a  village  near  Tartous)
    against the decision on 12 April 2010  to  remove  him  as  an  illegal
    entrant,  consequent  on  the  refusal  of  his  asylum   claim.    For
    convenience,  we  shall  retain  the   designations   'appellant'   and
    'respondent' for  the  parties  as  they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  This case has been listed for country guidance on Syria, but
    before we turn to more general considerations, we  shall  set  out  the
    factual background to the appellant's own case.

 3. On 17 February 2009 (the same day as he is said to have arrived in  the
    United Kingdom in the back of a lorry), the appellant was  arrested  by
    the police in  Kent  and  taken  to  Bexleyheath  Police  Station.   He
    initially claimed to be a  Palestinian,  but  a  search  on  'livescan'
    revealed that he was a Syrian  who,  on  29  November  2007,  had  been
    refused a visit visa by the British Embassy in Beirut.  An  immigration
    officer now attended the police station, and in a taped  interview  the
    appellant explained that he had pretended to be Palestinian so that his
    real immigration history would not be known.  He now admitted  that  he
    had left Syria the  previous  month  and  had  travelled  through  many
    countries before reaching Italy.   From  there  he  went  by  train  to
    Belgium, where he concealed himself in the lorry which brought  him  to
    this country.  His reason for coming  here  was  to  work  and  thereby
    support his family in Syria, who were very poor.

 4. Bio-Data Information signed by the appellant the next day included  the
    information that he had been employed as  a  car  electrician  in  Arab
    Alshatea, near Tartous, from 2004 to 2009.   On  24  February  2009  an
    application form for an Emergency Travel Document was filled in  by  an
    immigration officer, but the proposed removal never took place,  and  a
    year later, on 1 March  2010,  the  appellant  claimed  asylum.   At  a
    Screening Interview the same day he said that he had crossed the border
    between Syria and the Lebanon on 12 July 2007 and had stayed there with
    cousins until 22 January 2009, when he was smuggled onto a  ship.   The
    ship brought him to an unknown country, where he  stayed  for  a  month
    before being put on the lorry which took him  to  this  country  on  18
    February 2009.  He had no documents with him at the time,  but  he  was
    able subsequently to produce his Syrian passport.  His uncle  had  paid
    approximately 2,000-3,000 Euros to an agent, in order for him  to  come
    here.

 5. The appellant now said that he had gone to the Lebanon to  avoid  being
    arrested when  the  police  broke  up  a  demonstration  which  he  had
    attended.  He wanted to demonstrate for a change of  regime  because  a
    lot of his relatives had been arrested, although  he  himself  was  not
    involved with any political party while in Syria.

 6. On 11 March 2010 the appellant had his Asylum Interview,  in  which  he
    said that 15 of his friends were arrested on 1 December 2007, and  that
    he himself fled to the Lebanon just in time, before the security forces
    came to his house on 7 December  2007  with  an  arrest  warrant.   The
    appellant had become incensed with  the  regime  after  completing  his
    military service in  2007,  because  two  of  his  relatives  had  been
    arrested.  One was never released, while the other had lost his mind by
    the time he was released.  During his stay in the Lebanon the appellant
    got involved in political activities, until that  country  also  became
    too risky for him.  The Syrian passport, issued on 18 July 2007,  which
    the appellant brought to the interview, had been stamped by the British
    Embassy  in  Beirut  on  5  November  2007,  and  the  stamp  had  been
    subsequently crossed through to show that the visa application had been
    rejected.  The appellant acknowledged that he had gone to  the  Lebanon
    to make the application.  It was easy to get there from Arab Shatie  (a
    village in Lebanon) without any ID at all,  as  it  was  close  to  the
    border and one just had to cross over a small river.

 7. At the appeal hearing on 14 June 2010  the  appellant  added  that  the
    security forces had been back to the family home several times, looking
    for him, and that three of his brothers had been arrested on  different
    occasions and detained for one or two days, to  intimidate  them.   But
    Judge Canavan was "unable to accept that the authorities came  to  know
    about his political activities and approached his  family  in  the  way
    that he says."   Indeed,  she  made  an  overall  negative  credibility
    finding:

        "In the absence of any further evidence to support his claim I find
        that serious doubts are raised about the credibility  of  the  core
        aspects of the appellant's account.  His account of  his  political
        activities has been vague and his actions in obtaining  a  passport
        and applying for entry clearance do not indicate that he was of any
        interest to the authorities at the time.  His subsequent actions in
        returning to Syria and then travelling back  to  Lebanon,  and  his
        behaviour on arrival in the UK, are not consistent with someone who
        has a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution.   His  account  of  the
        authorities showing interest  in  his  family  after  he  left  the
        country has  been  confused  and  contradictory  and  I  found  his
        evidence on this issue to be unclear and  unreliable.   I  conclude
        that, in the absence of any further evidence, I am unable to accept
        the core aspects  of  the  appellant's  account  even  on  the  low
        standard of proof.  The  appellant  has  failed  to  establish  the
        overall credibility of his account.  His actions show that his main
        motivation for coming to the UK  appears  to  have  been  to  learn
        English and find work."

 8. Judge Canavan nevertheless allowed the appeal.  She consulted the  most
    recent country guidance in SA & IA (Undocumented Kurds) Syria CG [2009]
    UKAIT 6, focusing upon paragraphs 6 and 7 of the italicised head-note :

        "6.  There is no real risk that leaving Syria illegally  would,  in
             the absence of additional aggravating factors, result in  ill-
             treatment on return amounting to persecution or  a  breach  of
             human rights.
        7.   A failed asylum seeker will  not  be  perceived  as  being  an
             opponent of the regime simply  by  reason  of  having  claimed
             asylum abroad and  will  not  as  such  be  at  real  risk  of
             persecutory ill-treatment on return."

 9. These two conclusions had, the judge thought,  been  overtaken  by  the
    deteriorating situation in Syria since the country  guidance  case  was
    heard in November 2008,  albeit  the  evidence  for  that  was  slight.
    Indeed, the only evidence before  her  was  a  change  in  the  wording
    between the US State Department Report for the year 2007 and  that  for
    the year 2009.  The former said that the Syrian  government  "routinely
    arrested dissidents who tried to return to the country after  years  or
    even decades in exile", whereas the latter  said  that  the  government
    "routinely arrested  dissidents  and  former  citizens  with  no  known
    political affiliation who tried to return to the country after years or
    even decades in exile."  The Report for 2009  also  mentioned  numerous
    reports by human rights organisations of the security forces  arresting
    people who were not apparently involved in political  activities.   The
    phrases "numerous reports" and "routine  arrests"  indicated  to  Judge
    Canavan that such incidents were now likely to be sufficiently  regular
    and systematic  to  create  at  least  a  'serious  possibility'  or  a
    'reasonable degree of likelihood' of ill-treatment on return, even to a
    person with no known political profile.

10. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought by the  Secretary
    of State, on the basis that the phrases "numerous reports" and "routine
    arrests" were in themselves insufficiently precise to found a departure
    from the current country guidance.   Granting  permission  on  22  July
    2010, Upper Tribunal Judge  McKee  observed  that  the  phrase  "former
    citizens with no known political affiliation" appeared to  mean  people
    who had renounced or otherwise lost their Syrian citizenship, which was
    not the case with this appellant.  This observation was developed by Mr
    Blundell, a Senior Presenting Officer,  when  the  matter  came  before
    Upper Tribunal Judge Moulden on 11 November 2010. Judge  Moulden  found
    that there had indeed been an error of law such that  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal had to  be  set  aside,  in  that  the  country
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was not of sufficient weight to
    justify departing from the most recent country  guidance  case.   Upper
    Tribunal Judge Moulden's decision is in  the  first  appendix  to  this
    decision.  Paragraph 20 of the decision indicated that Judge  Canavan's
    findings on credibility and fact were preserved.

11. The appellant, who  had  previously  been  unrepresented,  subsequently
    instructed Sheikh &  Co.,  but  that  firm  ceased  practice  and  Aman
    Solicitors stepped in at short notice to fill the breach.   The  appeal
    was adjourned for a further hearing, limited to the  issue  of  whether
    the appellant would be at  risk  on  return,  in  the  light  of  Judge
    Canavan's findings of credibility and fact.  The new solicitors  needed
    time to prepare, and wished to obtain an expert report.  In May 2011 it
    was adumbrated at a Case Management Review Hearing that the case  might
    be  suitable  for  country  guidance,  and  although  at  another  Case
    Management Review Hearing in October Mr Ouseley argued  that  the  time
    was not right for a country guidance case,  the  designation  has  been
    maintained.  Prior to the substantive hearing in March 2012, Mr Ouseley
    repeated his view that the appeal should not be set  down  for  country
    guidance, owing to the volatility of the situation  in  Syria,  but  it
    seems to us that, whatever its ultimate fate, the  Assad  regime  could
    remain in power for a very  long  time.   There  has  been  no  country
    guidance on Syria since the current unrest began  in  March  2011,  and
    there is a clear need for an update on whether the guidance in SA &  IA
    is still to be followed.

12. In preparation  for  this  hearing,  the  appellant  signed  a  Witness
    Statement on 24 February 2012 in which he says that on five  occasions,
    between July 2011 and 18  February  2012,  he  attended  demonstrations
    outside the Syrian Embassy in London, and that he attended another  one
    in Trafalgar Square.   He  has  no  photographs  of  himself  at  these
    demonstrations.  Meanwhile two of the  appellant's  brothers  in  Syria
    were, he says, arrested at a demonstration, and were detained  for  two
    months, suffering regular ill-treatment.  The  authorities  have  twice
    searched the appellant's family home, looking for evidence.

13. Since signing the Witness Statement the appellant states  that  he  has
    attended another demonstration outside the Syrian Embassy, and has  put
    together a set of eleven photographs, showing  him  among  a  crowd  of
    protestors at this demonstration.   At  the  hearing  on  6  March  the
    appellant gave live evidence, adopting his Witness Statement, and  told
    Mr Ouseley that he had now been to a total of eight demonstrations, the
    most recent being on 3 March and the  first  approximately  six  months
    previously.  He told Mr Nasim that a relative in the Lebanon  had  sent
    his Syrian passport to him about six months after  he  had  arrived  in
    this country.  He did not use the passport in order to travel, lest  it
    be realised that he was a national of Syria.

14. We pause at this juncture to emphasize that the appeal  before  us  has
    proceeded on the basis that the negative credibility  findings  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, set out in [7] above, are  to  stand.  Indeed,  we
    regard those findings as amply  justified.   It  is  telling  that  the
    appellant did not want the authorities in the country of refuge to know
    that he was from Syria.  He tried to pass himself off as a  Palestinian
    and failed to claim asylum for over a  year  after  being  served  with
    illegal entry papers.  Judge Canavan did not believe that the appellant
    had been in any trouble  with  the  Syrian  authorities,  or  that  his
    parents and siblings had been harassed on account  of  his  activities.
    We think it no more likely to be  true  that  his  brothers  have  been
    detained  and  ill-treated   more   recently   for   taking   part   in
    demonstrations, and  that  his  parents  have  been  harassed  on  that
    account.  Nor do we accept that the  appellant  has  been  to  as  many
    demonstrations in London as he claims.  In  his  Witness  Statement  he
    says that the first of these took  place  in  July  2011,  but  at  the
    hearing on 6 March 2012 he told us that it was six months ago, counting
    back from March 2012.  There is no corroboration from anyone else  that
    the appellant has been to more demonstrations than the one on  3  March
    2012, no letter from an opposition group  or  even  from  a  friend  or
    fellow-Syrian.  It is trite that asylum seekers  may  not  be  able  to
    provide corroboration  of  a  genuine  claim,  but  when  corroborating
    evidence should  be  easy  to  obtain,  its  absence  may  well  affect
    credibility.

Country Guidance Question

15. Aman Solicitors Advocates have  provided  us  with  several  lever-arch
    files with material about the unrest which has beset Syria since  March
    2011 and its brutal suppression by the Ba'athist regime.  Most of  this
    is not central to our  deliberations  but  it  does  provide  important
    background.  The violence that has occurred will be familiar to  anyone
    who follows the news.  An Amnesty International report published on  14
    March 2012 gives graphic details of the torture  methods  practised  in
    detention centres over the past year.   There  can  be  no  doubt  that
    opposition activists, or those perceived to be such, who fall into  the
    hands of the regime, are at real risk  of  serious  ill-treatment.   So
    much is acknowledged in paragraphs 59 and 60 and the  second  paragraph
    of the head-note to SA & IA: "a person  with  an  actual  or  perceived
    profile of being anti-regime would be at real risk  of  persecution  on
    return to Syria."

16. We are concerned, rather, with paragraphs 75 to 89 of  SA & IA on risks
    for failed asylum seekers, summarised in paragraph 7 of  the  head-note
    as follows:

        "7.  A failed asylum seeker will  not  be  perceived  as  being  an
             opponent of the regime simply  by  reason  of  having  claimed
             asylum abroad and  will  not  as  such  be  at  real  risk  of
             persecutory ill-treatment on return."

17. The question for us is whether the findings in  SA  &  IA  on  risk  to
    failed asylum seekers remain valid as country guidance, or whether they
    have been overtaken by current events in Syria.  We heard oral evidence
    on this from the well-known expert on Syria, Dr Alan George,  who  also
    provided two written reports - one dated 1 March 2012  (superseding  an
    earlier one of 4 March 2011) and an  addendum  report  dated  13  March
    2012, sent to us after the hearing.  Amnesty International also put  in
    a report specifically on behalf of the  appellant,  dated  28  February
    2012.  For his part, Mr Ouseley relied principally on  the  Country  of
    Origin Information Report issued in September 2010 (which of course pre-
    dates the current unrest) and Operational Guidance Notes issued  on  10
    November 2011 and July 2012  (which  are  largely  concerned  with  the
    current unrest) and he was also able to provide  a  document  dated  16
    August 2012 setting out the process followed  by  the  respondent  when
    obtaining travel  documents  for  Syrian  nationals.  Apart  from  oral
    submissions, we have also benefited greatly from  Mr  Nasim's  skeleton
    argument and written  submissions,  filed  at  our  request  after  the
    hearing.  Mr Ouseley's post-hearing written submissions called forth  a
    Reply from Mr Nasim. We were also  provided  with  written  submissions
    dated 1 July 2012 and 15 August 2012 from  the  appellant's  solicitors
    and a short submission from Ms Athi for the respondent dated 16  August
    2012. We  have  taken  all  of  these  into  account  in  reaching  the
    conclusions which we set out below.




Failed Asylum Seekers

18. An Interim Operational Instruction of the UK  Border  Agency,  dated  6
    January 2012, defers all escorted removals to Syria for the time being.
      Removals  have  also  been  suspended  from  several  other  European
    countries, as recommended by the UNHCR, while Mr Nasim has drawn to our
    attention the praise  given  by  the  US  Committee  for  Refugees  and
    Migrants to the Homeland Security Secretary on  26  March  2012  having
    been praised for granting 'temporary protected status' to  all  Syrians
    currently in the United States.  None of this demonstrates on its  own,
    however, that Syrian asylum seekers  in  the  United  Kingdom  must  be
    granted refugee status.  As the  Zimbabwe  litigation  shows,  enforced
    removals can be suspended for a very long time, even where real risk on
    return is not established.

19.  Whether,  therefore,  failed  asylum  seekers  face  a  real  risk  of
    persecution or serious harm or ill treatment contrary to Article 3 is a
    matter to be considered on the available evidence.   Despite  the  fact
    that there appear to have been no forced  returns  to  Syria  for  some
    time, there was, nevertheless, opinion on this issue  in  a  number  of
    documents before us.  Firstly, we had the reports and oral evidence  of
    Dr George as regards which we took an entirely similar view to that  of
    the Tribunal in SA & IA at paragraph 47 where it stated:

        "We would observe at this stage that we found Dr George to be  well
        informed  about  Syrian  affairs  and  his  evidence  to   us   was
        thoughtful, detailed and helpful. We were impressed by the  way  in
        which in his oral evidence he was careful to  avoid  exceeding  his
        brief as an expert witness; to indicate clearly  when  he  did  not
        know the answers to questions; and to indicate where there  was  in
        his view a grey area. We also have the benefit  of  having  several
        written reports from him as well as his oral evidence, which  taken
        together have given us the opportunity to see the evolution of  his
        thinking in the context of the other objective evidence. Of  course
        we have to reach our own conclusions on the evidence as a whole and
        in line with the law but  we  have  given  serious  weight  to  his
        evidence."

20. Dr George's evidence to the Tribunal in SA &  IA  maintained  that  the
    appellant would face mistreatment on return merely  because  he  was  a
    forced returnee.  It was also Dr George's firm view that any Syrian who
    has claimed asylum abroad will be perceived as an oppositionist,  which
    is quite sufficient cause for him to  be  detained  and  maltreated  on
    return.   However the Tribunal at paragraph 89 of SA & IA did not  find
    it would agree on this issue.  Does the more recent evidence suggest  a
    different conclusion?

21. In his report of 1 March 2012, Dr George confirms that nearly all those
    who have been arrested and maltreated after being forcibly returned  to
    Syria have had a political profile, as known or  suspected  members  of
    the Muslim Brotherhood, Kurdish separatists,  etc.   According  to  the
    April 2007 report by the Danish Refugee Council, and  indeed  according
    to what a senior official at the  Syrian  Embassy  in  London  told  Dr
    George in 2006, the Syrian authorities  did  not  regard  everyone  who
    seeks asylum abroad as an opponent of the regime, recognising that some
    Syrians have economic motives for doing so.  This was also the view  of
    the UNHCR Representative in Damascus, whereas the  London-based  Syrian
    Human Rights Committee insisted in 2008 that "any one who  applies  for
    asylum and [is] known to the Syrian security services will be arrested,
    prosecuted  and  detained  for  distributing  false  information  about
    Syria."

22. Until a joint report of the Austrian Centre for  Country  of  Origin  &
    Asylum Research and Documentation,  the  Austrian  Red  Cross  and  the
    Danish Immigration Service was published in May  2010,  the  most  that
    could be said, according to Dr George, was that  "it  would  have  been
    imprudent to assert categorically that claiming asylum abroad in and of
    itself would never cause adverse attention from the Syrian authorities.
    ... Evidently, it was something that did happen, albeit that it did not
    happen routinely or even often."

23.  The  Austrian-Danish  report  of  May  2010,  however,  included  this
    information from a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch  (HRW)  in
    Beirut:


        "[R]eturned failed asylum seekers are  most  likely  detained  upon
        return to Syria, although not necessarily  for  a  long  period  of
        time.  It was added that  there  was  a  high  likelihood  of  ill-
        treatment during  their  initial  detention  which  can  amount  to
        torture if the person is expected to know something of interest  to
        the security service.  What will happen to a  returnee  depends  on
        what is in the file (if there is one) or on  whether  the  security
        services believe what the returnee tells.  Usually, the authorities
        release returnees after making a file on them  and  probably  refer
        them to an investigative judge.   Upon  release  persons  are  very
        commonly required to report regularly."


    and:


        "Regarding the situation for failed asylum  seekers,  Nadim  Houry,
        HRW,  state  that  every  returned  failed   asylum   seeker   will
        automatically be detained and interrogated."

24. The example given by the HRW researcher, however, was that of a Kurdish
    musician who left Syria in the aftermath of an  uprising  in  2004  and
    sought asylum in Norway.  He was  mistreated  on  return  as  a  failed
    asylum seeker but  it  seems  to  us  that  his  profile  was  somewhat
    different to that of a failed asylum  seeker  who  may  have  left  for
    purely economic reasons.

25. The Austrian-Danish report indicates, however, that the view of the HRW
    researcher on failed asylum seekers being  likely  to  be  detained  on
    return was also held by a number  of  Western  diplomatic  sources  who
    remained unnamed.  One "Western diplomatic source" stated that a failed
    asylum seeker:

             "would be detained upon return to Syria simply because of  the
             fact that he or she has been  abroad.   The  person  would  be
             subjected to interrogation by the security services.  However,
             it is unclear how the person  would  be  treated  during  this
             detention that in some cases could  last  for  weeks  or  even
             longer."

26. Another comment from "a Western diplomatic source" was that out of  the
    four Syrian nationals repatriated in recent months, three were detained
    and then released and one was charged with spreading false  information
    abroad.  We noted that those returns would have been at some  point  in
    late 2009 where the Austrian-Danish report was published in  May  2010.



27. Two Operational Guidance Notes (OGNs), dated  November  2011  and  July
    2012 respectively, were provided by the respondent and referred  to  by
    both parties in their submissions. We took a careful  approach  to  the
    OGNs, taking into account the caveat at the beginning of both documents
    that they did not purport to be comprehensive and had to  be  "read  in
    conjunction with the relevant COI Service country of origin information
    and any other relevant information". At the time that we  reserved  our
    decision there was no relevant Country  of  Origin  Information  Report
    (COIR) on Syria against which to read the  OGNs,  as  the  most  recent
    report was that of September 2010 which, obviously, did not comment  at
    all on the uprisings of 2011 and  ensuing  events.   However,  we  were
    provided with the full versions of all the sources  relied  on  in  the
    OGNs and have set out our views above on what we considered to  be  the
    relevant parts. We also noted that the Syria COIR dated 15 August 2012,
    issued after we reserved our decision, relied on the same  sources  and
    did not dissent from  anything  set  out  in  the  OGNs,  for  example,
    confirming that the Austrian-Danish report  contained  evidence  of  "a
    number of sources [which] agreed that failed asylum seekers and persons
    who had  left  Syria  illegally  would  generally  face  detention  and
    investigation upon return". Given  that  we  approached  them  in  that
    context, we found it appropriate to have  regard  to  the  respondent's
    guidance to her caseworkers as set out in the OGNs.

28. The November 2011 OGN concludes the section on "Returning failed asylum
    seekers" thus:

        "3.9.7 Conclusion: The Syrian authorities have become  increasingly
        repressive  in  recent  years,  and  there  are  numerous   reports
        indicating that some returnees, including  failed  asylum  seekers,
        may be at risk of ill-treatment on return to Syria.  The  available
        evidence suggests that returnees of  Kurdish  ethnicity  and  those
        whose opposition to the government is known  or  suspected  by  the
        security services would be at particular risk.  Given  the  growing
        civil unrest and increasingly volatile conditions, it  is  possible
        that returnees would be viewed with suspicion  by  the  authorities
        and credible reports of the surveillance of  Syrian  activists  and
        demonstrators in the UK are likely  to  increase  this  risk.  (our
        emphasis)"

29. The OGN of July 2012 refers at 3.11.4 to  reports  that  failed  asylum
    seekers were likely to be detained on return, "simply because they  had
    been abroad." Relying on the US State Department Report for 2011 and  a
    further Human Rights Watch report dated 3 July 2012, the July 2012  OGN
    states at 3.11.5:


        "Since  the  outbreak  of  violent  civil  disorder,   the   Syrian
        authorities  have  become  progressively  more  brutal   in   their
        treatment of individuals perceived  to  be  opposed  to  the  Assad
        regime. Following the lifting of the Emergency Law in  April  2011,
        security forces continued their previous practices and have carried
        out larger numbers of arbitrary  arrests.   As  levels  of  violent
        repression of political protest have intensified, anyone  perceived
        to be critical of, or hostile to, the Syrian authorities is  likely
        to face arbitrary arrest and  extreme  ill-treatment  in  detention
        (our emphasis)."

     and at 3.11.8:

        "Careful  consideration  should  be   given   to   the   particular
        circumstances of the individual, including the reasons  for  having
        left Syria, any previous activities within the military or security
        services, any political profile, or any evidence  of  having  taken
        part in demonstrations or other expressions of  opposition  to  the
        regime, including any such activity in the UK.  The  intention  and
        the ability of the Syrian authorities to monitor all expressions of
        opposition should not be underestimated.  Even where there has been
        no previous expression of anti-regime views, a grant of asylum will
        be appropriate if there is a real  risk  of  the  individual  being
        perceived as having opposition sympathies (our emphasis)."

30. It appears to us that the  respondent's  position  in  the  OGNs  (also
    reflected in the sources set out in the COIR dated 15 August 2012)  was
    consistent with that of Dr George and Human  Rights  Watch  as  to  the
    increased likelihood of a  failed  asylum  seeker  being  imputed  with
    opposition sympathies or views on return to Syria.

31. It is also our view that the developments in  the  evidence  on  failed
    asylum seekers are entirely consistent with the  wider  and  undisputed
    country evidence on the very marked increase in abuses  in  Syria  from
    the spring of 2011 onwards.  For example, a comparison of the  2010  US
    State Department report on Human Rights,  already  dispiriting  enough,
    with that of 2011, makes for profoundly depressing reading.   The  2011
    report sets out the willingness of the regime to  use  "indiscriminate"
    and "deadly force against its citizens" with "victims chosen at  random
    and many of them  ...  not  associated  with  the  protests"  and  "the
    substantial increase in the use of torture" and states that there "were
    a significant number of exceptionally brutal cases of abuse of children
    by the regime during the year." Prison  conditions  were  "[h]arsh  and
    life-threatening".

32. How would a failed asylum seeker or forced returnee being returned  now
    fare in  that  context?   Having  surveyed  the  more  recent  evidence
    provided by Dr George, the information contained in the joint Austrian-
    Danish report and the indication that it was the respondent's  position
    that it was "possible that returnees would be  viewed  with  suspicion"
    and "that even failed asylum seekers may be at risk  of  ill-treatment"
    we find that we have to take a different  view  to  that  expressed  in
    paragraphs 75 to 89 of SA & IA. We accept that in the  context  of  the
    extremely high level of human  rights  abuses  currently  occurring  in
    Syria, a regime which appears increasingly concerned to crush any  sign
    of resistance, it is likely that  a  failed  asylum  seeker  or  forced
    returnee would, in general, on arrival face a real risk of  arrest  and
    detention and of serious mistreatment during that detention as a result
    of imputed political opinion. That is sufficient to qualify for refugee
    protection. The position might be otherwise in the case of someone who,
    notwithstanding a failed claim for asylum, would still be perceived  on
    return to Syria as a supporter of the Assad regime.

33. Where a failed asylum seeker would, in general, be at risk  on  return,
    the conclusion at paragraph 89 of SA & IA is no longer valid.

34.  Since  we  have  found  the  appellant  to  be  eligible  for  refugee
    protection, he cannot succeed in his claim for a  grant  of  subsidiary
    protection  under  Article  15(c)  of   the   Qualification   Directive
    2004/83/EC, implemented as humanitarian protection under paragraph 339C
    of our Immigration Rules. Where that is so and given that  the  country
    evidence continues to show the violence moving to different but limited
    areas of the country on an unpredictable course, we say nothing more on
    this ground.

Conclusion

35. The appellant's appeal is allowed because of what we say  at  paragraph
    32.  We are conscious that the usefulness of this country guidance  may
    prove highly contingent and possibly very short-lived.  The  increasing
    levels of violence across different areas of Syria may provoke the much
    debated outside intervention or it may  be,  as  we  commented  at  the
    outset of this determination that the Assad regime  will  cling  on  to
    power for a long time yet.

Anonymity


36. We make an anonymity order pursuant to rule 14 (1) (b) of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.


DECISION

37. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal disclosed an error on  a  point
    of law and is set aside.

38. We re-make the decision by allowing KB's appeal on  Refugee  Convention
    grounds and on Article 3 grounds.  He is not entitled  to  a  grant  of
    Humanitarian Protection.

                ERROR OF LAW DECISION DATED 12 NOVEMBER 2010


APPELLANT:    SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

RESPONDENT:   KB

CASE NO:      AA/05466/2010

DATE OF INITIAL HEARING IN UPPER TRIBUNAL: 11 November 2010

Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr M Blundell a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Miss K Grant of Counsel instructed by Aman Solicitors


REASONS FOR FINDING THAT TRIBUNAL MADE  AN  ERROR  OF  LAW,  SUCH  THAT  ITS
DECISION FALLS TO BE SET ASIDE


   1. The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home  Department.  The
      respondent is a citizen of Syria who was born on 10 December 1986. The
      appellant has been given permission to  appeal  the  determination  of
      Immigration Judge Canavan allowing the respondent's appeal against the
      appellant's decision of 12 April  2010  to  give  directions  for  the
      respondent's removal from the United Kingdom following the refusal  of
      asylum.

   2. The respondent claimed to have entered the UK illegally in the back of
      a lorry on 17 February 2009. He was arrested the same day and  claimed
      asylum  on  1  March  2010.  He  had  made  an  earlier   unsuccessful
      application for entry clearance in Beirut on 29 November 2007.

   3. The respondent claimed  that  he  carried  out  his  military  service
      between 2005 and 2007 and during that time he met some young  men  who
      wanted to  agitate  against  the  government.  When  he  finished  his
      military service he claimed to have become involved with a  group  who
      were printing and distributing opposition leaflets. He claimed to have
      distributed leaflets and to be an opponent of the governing regime. He
      said that members of his family had been  arrested  in  the  past.  He
      claimed that the security forces arrested members of  his  group  and,
      fearing arrest and  torture,  he  fled  the  country  to  Lebanon.  He
      remained in Lebanon for about 10 days before  returning  to  Syria  to
      await the outcome of his visa application, which was refused. He  said
      that he then learnt  that  further  members  of  his  group  had  been
      arrested. He left the country with others, illegally, and travelled to
      Lebanon. He claimed that after he left Syria the security forces  came
      to his family home with  an  arrest  warrant.  They  had  returned  at
      intervals since then. He claimed that three of his brothers  had  been
      arrested. He also claimed that two of his  friends  were  arrested  in
      Lebanon and sent back to Syria. He left Lebanon in January 2009, spent
      about a month in an unknown European country and then travelled to the
      UK.

   4. Neither the appellant nor the respondent was  represented  before  the
      judge. The respondent attended and gave evidence. The judge found that
      he was not a credible witness. She did not believe the core aspects of
      his account. She concluded that his main motivation for coming to  the
      UK was to learn English and find work. The respondent has  not  sought
      to challenge these conclusions.

   5. The judge made reference to the  country  guidance  case  relating  to
      Syria, SA and IA (Undocumented Kurds)  Syria  CG  [2009]  UKAIT  00006
      which indicated that a failed asylum  seeker  returning  from  the  UK
      would not  be  at  risk  of  persecution  absent  further  aggravating
      factors. She made reference to the COIR report dated 6  February  2009
      and the US State Department Report dated 11 March 2010. In  the  light
      of the latter report she concluded that the  situation  in  Syria  had
      deteriorated and that the appellant would be at risk of persecution on
      return. She allowed the appeal on asylum and Article  3  human  rights
      grounds.

   6. The appellant argues that the judge should have followed  the  country
      guidance case of SA and IA and there was  no  evidence  of  sufficient
      weight or clarity to depart from this.

   7. Mr Blundell submitted that the background to the judge's decision  was
      the finding that the  respondent  was  not  a  credible  witness.  His
      account of events was not believed and if he was return  to  Syria  it
      would be as nothing more than a returning failed  asylum  seeker.  The
      judge properly took the country guidance cases as her  starting  point
      and  he  made  no  criticism  of  the  fact  that  in  the   difficult
      circumstances where neither party was represented she  made  reference
      to the used country guidance material contained in the COIR report and
      the US Department of State Report. She seized on  passages  which  she
      summarised in paragraph 40 of the determination.  He  emphasised  that
      the key passage from the March 2010  US  State  Department  Report  on
      which her decision turned stated that the Syrian government "routinely
      arrested dissidents  and  former  citizens  with  no  known  political
      affiliation who tried to return to the country  after  years  or  even
      decades in exile". The respondent was not a  "former  citizen".  There
      was no evidence to indicate that he had lost or was being deprived  of
      his Syrian citizenship.  Mr  Blundell  referred  me  to  a  number  of
      passages  in  the  country  guidance  case,  in   particular   between
      paragraphs 139 and 142. He accepted that at  that  time  the  evidence
      pointed in two directions. The expert  witnesses  did  not  agree  but
      UNHCR were of the view that returning failed asylum seekers would  not
      be at risk.

   8. Mr Blundell argued that the factors relied on by  the  judge  did  not
      support her decision to depart from country  guidance  authority.  The
      evidence was not clear. The respondent was not a Kurd,  not  stateless
      and not a dissident. The other passages referred to by the  judge  did
      not indicate any change from the position assessed by the panel in  SA
      and IA. I was asked to find that there was an error of law, to  remake
      the decision and to dismiss the appeal.

   9. Miss Grant asked me to uphold the determination. She argued  that  the
      judge was correct in reaching her findings. The US Department of State
      report was up-to-date and persuasive. The judge did not put  too  much
      weight on it. The passage on page 78 supported her conclusion.

  10. Miss Grant submitted that the judge had found that the respondent took
      part in some politically related activities in Lebanon after  he  left
      Syria. I asked her to point me to any  passage  in  the  determination
      which supported this submission. She referred me to paragraph  37  but
      this contains a broad adverse  credibility  finding  and  I  can  find
      nothing which supports her contention.

  11. Miss Grant then drew my attention to what she said  were  the  panel's
      conclusions in SA and  IA  at  page  103  paragraph  4  and  page  116
      paragraph 2 (these being the page numbers in the respondent's bundle).
      Mr Blundell objected. I agreed with him that  the  passages  to  which
      Miss Grant referred were not the conclusions of the panel but a record
      of submissions made to them. Miss Grant  argued  that  the  respondent
      would be at risk on  return  because  he  left  Syria  illegally.  She
      submitted that there was no error of law and the determination  should
      be upheld.

  12. In his reply Mr Blundell pointed out that the respondent  had  claimed
      to have taken part in politically related activities in Lebanon.  This
      was  addressed  in  the  refusal  letter  at  paragraph  62  but   the
      respondent's claims were rejected by  the  appellant  and  the  judge.
      Paragraph 4 of the  head  note  in  SA  and  IA  did  not  assist  the
      respondent. It had not been accepted that he had  taken  part  in  any
      anti-regime activities.

  13. Miss Grant submitted that if I did find  an  error  of  law  then  the
      respondent, who was unrepresented at the  hearing  before  the  judge,
      should be given the opportunity to submit expert evidence in  relation
      to his contention that  the  situation  for  returning  failed  asylum
      seekers had deteriorated since SA and IA. I reserved my determination.

  14.  The  head  note  to  SA  and  IA,  written  by  the  authors  of  the
      determination states, in paragraph 6 and 7;

           "6. There is no real risk that leaving Syria illegally would, in
           the absence of additional aggravating factors,  result  in  ill-
           treatment on return amounting to  persecution  or  a  breach  of
           human rights.

           7. A failed asylum seeker will not  be  perceived  as  being  an
           opponent of the regime simply by reason of having claimed asylum
           abroad and will not as such be at real risk of persecutory  ill-
           treatment on return."

  15. In paragraph 44 of her determination the judge said;

           "44. The only evidence before me that  seems  different  to  the
           evidence in November 2008 is a slight, but perhaps  significant,
           change to the wording of the US State Department report relating
           to the risk to returnees. The US  State  Department  report  for
           2007 quoted the COIR report (paragraph 14.05) stating  that  the
           government "routinely arrested dissidents who tried to return to
           the country after years or even decades in exile". The  tribunal
           accepted that those with a known or suspected political  profile
           against the regime would be at risk on return. However, in light
           of a further deterioration in the  human  rights  situation  the
           most recent US State Department report issued in March 2010  now
           states that the government  "routinely  arrests  dissidents  and
           former citizens with no known political affiliation who tried to
           return to the country after years or even decades in exile". The
           judge emphasised the words underlined.

  16. The judge went on to say, in paragraph 45;

           "45. Because the appellant has  been  unable  to  find  a  legal
           representative to take on his case, and doesn't have a realistic
           prospect of doing so, the case hasn't been prepared in as full a
           way as I might have expected if he were represented. It would of
           course assist me to have an expert opinion from someone  of  the
           calibre of Dr George, who gave evidence to the  tribunal  in  SA
           and IA (Syria), and/or to have a  broader  range  of  background
           evidence to assess the risk on  return.  Unfortunately  I  don't
           have such evidence before me so I have  to  make  my  assessment
           based on the more recent US State Department report."

  17. I find that the judge was right to say that the difference between the
      evidence before her and the evidence before the Tribunal in SA and  IA
      was slight. I do  not  accept  that,  on  close  examination,  it  was
      "perhaps significant". A close examination and comparison of  the  two
      passages in the US State Department reports for 2007  and  2010  shows
      that the only change was the  addition  of  the  words  which  I  have
      underlined in the following passage "routinely arrested dissidents and
      former citizens with no  known  political  affiliation  who  tried  to
      return to the country after years or even decades in exile". Whilst it
      can be said that the respondent is  a  man  with  no  known  political
      affiliation he  is  not  a  former  citizen  of  Syria.  There  is  no
      indication that he is not now a citizen of Syria. I cannot find and it
      has not been suggested that there was any evidence to  help  establish
      what "former citizen" may mean. In the absence of such explanation the
      judge neglected to  address  the  obvious  meaning  which  would  have
      excluded the respondent from this category. The judge did not find, as
      Miss Grant suggested, that the respondent left Syria illegally.

  18. I find that the judge reached a conclusion which was not open  to  her
      on the evidence and that there was no evidence of sufficient weight to
      justify departing from a recent country guidance case.

  19. However, in considering whether to re-determine the appeal without  an
      adjournment I have taken into account the fact that the respondent was
      unrepresented at the hearing  before  the  judge.  The  judge  had  no
      assistance by way of representation for the appellant and she  had  no
      expert evidence or country material put before her by the parties. She
      properly relied on well-established country material.  The  respondent
      is now  represented  and  Miss  Grant  asked  that  he  be  given  the
      opportunity to obtain expert evidence, perhaps on the  lines  referred
      to by the judge in paragraph 45 of her determination mentioned above.

  20. I therefore adjourn for a further hearing  limited  to  the  issue  of
      whether the appellant would be at risk on return to Syria in the light
      of the judge's findings of credibility and fact.
