Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Nasim, instructed by M&K Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Pal, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants are citizens of Pakistan who were born respectively on 3
    February 1984 and 8 August 2010.  The second appellant is the  daughter
    of the first appellant.  The appellants had applied for entry clearance
    to the United Kingdom with a view to settlement  with  Muhammad  Ghafar
    (hereafter  referred  to  as  the  sponsor).   The  applications  (made
    respectively under paragraphs 281 and 301 of the Immigration Rules) had
    been refused by the Entry Clearance Officer by notices dated 10 October
    2012.  The  appellants  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Thanki) which, in a determination dated 11 November 2013, dismissed the
    appeals.  The appellants now appeal,  with  permission,  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. The facts of the appeals are not in dispute.  The first  appellant  and
    the sponsor had entered  a  religious  marriage  in  Pakistan  but  the
    sponsor had failed to complete his divorce from his first wife (who was
    living in the United Kingdom) at the time of the marriage  the  sponsor
    and first appellant had "married" on 26 October 2009; the  decree  nisi
    in the divorce of the sponsor from his first wife was not made absolute
    in proceedings in Watford County Court until 3 March 2011.

 3. The grounds of appeal assert that the  judge  wrongly  found  that  the
    sponsor had been domiciled in England and Wales  at  the  date  of  his
    marriage to the first appellant.  On the basis  that  the  sponsor  had
    been domiciled at that time in Pakistan, his polygamous marriage to the
    first appellant was valid and the first appellant's application  should
    not have been refused under paragraph 281(i)(a).

 4. Quite apart from the careful and cogent findings of the judge  on  this
    very issue at [20] the appellants face a major problem in  relation  to
    their Immigration Rules appeals.  At the hearing before the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge, the solicitor acting for the appellants "confirmed that
    the ground of appeal in relation to paragraph 281 and  301  were  being
    abandoned" [determination, 16].  As a formality, at [24] the judge went
    on to dismiss the appeals under those paragraphs.  Before me, Mr  Nasim
    sought to persuade me the appellants had, in fact, not abandoned  their
    appeals under the Immigration Rules.  Had they  done  so,  there  would
    have been no need for the judge at [20] to have made a  finding  as  to
    the sponsor's domicile.

 5. I reject Mr  Nasim's  submissions.   The  determination  could  not  be
    clearer.  The representative of the appellants told the judge that  the
    appellants did not seek to continue with their appeals in  relation  to
    paragraphs 281 and 301.  This left only the  appeals  under  Article  8
    ECHR and I find that the judge proceeded correctly by making a  finding
    of fact in respect of  the  sponsor's  domicile  at  the  date  of  his
    marriage for the purposes of that ground of appeal.  Mr Nasim submitted
    that, if the Immigration Rules appeals had been effectively  abandoned,
    then  this  might  indicate  that  the  entire  appeal  had  also  been
    abandoned.  I disagree.  Section 84 of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 provides that an appeal under Section 82(1) against  an
    immigration decision must be brought on "one or more"  of  the  grounds
    which are then set out in Section 84.  I can identify no difficulty  in
    the appellants abandoning their grounds under Section  84(1)(a)  ("that
    the decision is not in accordance  with  the  Immigration  Rules")  but
    maintaining the human rights  appeal under Article 8 ECHR.

 6. It  is  clear  that  the  judge  accurately  recorded  the  appellants'
    representative's withdrawal of the Immigration Rules grounds  and  that
    the same representative attempted to persuade the judge that the  first
    appellant's appeal should be considered under paragraph 290 of  HC  395
    (grant of entry clearance as  a  fianc�).   I  do  not  find  that  the
    representative would have made  that  submission  had  the  appeals  in
    respects of paragraph 281 and 301 been maintained.  I  also  find  that
    the judge properly rejected the submission  that  the  Tribunal  should
    consider the appeal under paragraph 290.  The judge had  proper  regard
    to CP (Section 86(3) and (5): wrong immigration rule)  Dominica  [2006]
    UKAIT 00040.  The judge found that this was not a  case  of  a  "wrong"
    application having been made under the Immigration Rules but  rather  a
    complete change in the nature of the application for  entry  clearance.
    The judge found at [23] that "it is [not] fair on the respondent for me
    to make a decision in relation to the first appellant as a fianc� under
    paragraph 290 as the requirements of that Rule need  to  be  considered
    fully by the respondent to see if the first  appellant  meets  all  the
    requirements."I can identify no error of law in that finding.

 7. The paragraphs 281 and 301 appeals having been abandoned and the  judge
    having rejected the attempt to appeal in respect of paragraph 290,  the
    only aspect of the appeal that remained to be determined was the appeal
    on Article 8 ECHR grounds.  The judge at [25] wrote:

         Article 8 ECHR has been raised by the appellant.  It is clear  that
         there was no family life between the appellants and  their  sponsor
         in the UK.  The sponsor has  spent  a  few  weeks  with  the  first
         appellant after their purported marriage and has revisited them  in
         2012.  Therefore what the family life exists in Pakistan  to  which
         there is no interference (sic).  The sponsor is of Pakistani origin
         and is free to travel to Pakistan as desired.   I  find  Article  8
         ECHR rights are not engaged.

 8. I acknowledge that it is  arguable  that  the  low  threshold  for  the
    engagement of Article 8 family life may have been met in this  instance
    and that the judge was wrong to find that it was not.   However,  I  do
    not consider any error on the part of the judge to be material  to  the
    outcome of the appeals.  It would have been extraordinary for the judge
    to have allowed the appeals under Article 8 where  the  appellants  had
    abandoned their Immigration Rules appeals acknowledging that they  were
    certain to fail.  Following MF [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, it is  clear  that
    only a small number of unusual cases will succeed under Article 8  ECHR
    where an appellant has failed to satisfy the Immigration Rules.   There
    must be a strong public interest concerned with preventing the grant of
    entry clearance to individuals under Article 8 where those  individuals
    have failed under the Immigration Rules.

 9. This brings me to the question of the sponsor's  domicile.   The  judge
    found at [20] that "on any account" the appellant was domiciled in  the
    UK in 2009.  He arrived in  this  country  in  2006  and  been  granted
    indefinite leave to remain in August 2008.  The judge  found  that,  at
    the date of his  marriage,  he  had  "settled  status...  in  the  UK."
    Domicile can be notoriously difficult to ascertain in  any  given  case
    but I consider that the judge's findings are cogent, well-reasoned  and
    firmly based on the evidence and I do not consider that he erred in law
    by concluding that the sponsor was domiciled in the United  Kingdom  at
    the date of his  marriage.   However,  even  if  I  am  wrong  in  that
    conclusion  (i) the fact  that  the  Immigration  Rules  appeals  under
    paragraphs 281 and 301 were abandoned; (ii) the judge decided that  the
    first appellant's appeal should not be considered under  paragraph  290
    and (iii) the Article 8 ECHR appeals should have been dismissed on  the
    basis that the immigration decisions were not disproportionate then, as
    the Secretary of State submitted in her Rule 24  response  "It  is  not
    clear... how the  issue  of  the  finding  on  domicile  can  arise  as
    material."

DECISION

10. This appeal is dismissed.
