                            DECISION AND REASONS

Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  I
make an order prohibiting  the  disclosure  or  publication  of  any  matter
likely to lead members of the public to identify the  Appellant.  Breach  of
this order can be punished as  a  contempt  of  court.  I  make  this  order
because the Appellant is an asylum seeker and publicity  might  put  him  at
risk.

The appellant is a citizen of Albania.  He was born  in  January  2003.   He
appeals a decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal  against
a decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  on  5  March  2020  refusing  him
international protection.

It is established that the  appellant  is  a  victim  of  trafficking.   The
appeal was dismissed because the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  was  satisfied
that the appellant could reasonably be expected to relocate to  a  place  of
safety within Albania.

The judge said at paragraph 116:

  "The appellant's family are (as far as he is aware)  still  in  his  home
  area of Shkodï¿½r.  This  is  where  the  drug  gang  first  recruited  the
  Appellant and I acknowledge that the Appellant may be at risk if he  were
  to return to his  home  area,  however  he  could  choose  to  internally
  relocate.  If the Appellant were to  internally  relocate  he  could  not
  avail himself of effective protection from his family, there  is  support
  available from the NGOs such as Different and Equal.  With  this  support
  upon  his  return  to  Albania  the  Appellant  could  rehabilitate   and
  reintegrate into Albanian  society.   Accordingly,  I  consider  internal
  relocation  to  be  reasonable  and  not  unduly   in   the   Appellant's
  circumstances".

As is plain from paragraphs 109 and 115 of the  Decision  and  Reasons,  the
problem with  this  is  that  the  judge  considered  the  difficulties  the
appellant would face in the event of his return  to  Albania  after  he  had
achieved his majority rather than at the date of decision  while  he  was  a
minor. As was explained correctly in the  skeleton  argument,  it  is  plain
following ST (Child asylum seekers) Sri Lanka [2003] UKUT  00292  (IAC),  if
it was not plain before, that where the appellant is a child the claim  must
be assessed at the date of the decision and  not  on  the  occasion  of  his
possible return when he has achieved his majority.

Whilst it might be the case (this is not  something  I  have  to  determine)
that the judge would have reached the same conclusion if  she  had  directed
herself correctly, she did not direct herself correctly and the  appeal  has
to be re-determined.  I set aside the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
and proceed immediately to make the decision on the basis of the facts  that
have been  found  and  the  submissions  made.  I  remind  myself  that  the
appellant is a refugee if he proves that there is a real risk of  his  being
persecuted for a convention reason  in  the  event  of  his  return  to  his
country of  nationality  and  that  risk  cannot  be  abated  by  reasonable
internal relocation.

Importantly, it has been established her  that  the  appellant  has  been  a
victim of trafficking and that he was made to  work  for  a  drug  gang  who
enforced their authority by hitting him in the face and breaking  his  nose.
One of the people involved in the gang was also working for the police.

As Mr Whitwell, rightly, pointed out it has also been established  that  the
appellant has a supportive family.  Close relatives  helped  him  travel  to
the United Kingdom believing that was a place  of  safety  for  him;  family
members hid him for a short while before he left and the appellant's  father
has some kind of construction based business.  It is not suggested that  the
appellant is wealthy but he is someone  whose  family  can  be  expected  to
support him wherever he might be and certainly in the event  of  his  return
to Albania.

I have already set out paragraph 116 of the Decision and  Reasons,  or  much
of it.  The preceding  paragraphs  are  also  highly  relevant.   The  judge
directed himself, correctly, at paragraph 112 that  following  the  decision
in MB (Internal relocation - burden of  proof)  Albania  [2019]  UKUT  00392
(IAC) that the issue of reasonableness in internal  relocation  poses  three
questions, namely:
  (1)    What is the location to which it  is  proposed  the  person  could
  move?
  (2)    Are there real risks of serious harm or persecution in this place?
  (3)    If not, is it reasonable or not unduly harsh to expect the  person
  to relocate to this place?

The judge went on to say in paragraph 113 that  he  accepted  evidence  that
Albania is a small country where  a  person  cannot  live  anonymously  and,
because it appeared to be accepted his family could not be expected to  live
with him, living  in  Tirana  without  pre-existing  social  contacts  or  a
support network would make him conspicuous and attract attention.   It  must
be remembered that the appellant is a young person who has  been  trafficked
and would be living in a place where traffickers remain active.   The  judge
said at paragraph 114 that the appellant would need support in the event  of
his immediate return and clearly found it,  following  authority,  "entirely
plausible" that he might be traced.  But  the  judge  also  found  that  the
appellant had some support from  his  family  members,  that  he  spoke  the
Albanian language and knew how to live in the city  and  he  could  relocate
there. He could, the judge found, on return  after  he  was  18  years  old,
avail himself of the help of, for example, and NGO,  "Different  and  Equal"
if his family could not help him.

I have to remake  the  decision  and  I  do  not  accept  that  that  is  an
appropriate finding at all for a boy not yet 18. The appellant would  be  on
his own but also was someone who had been  targeted  in  the  past  and  who
might be  targeted  again.   Without  some  support  the  idea  is  entirely
untenable.

I recognise the First-tier Tribunal Judge found that there would be  support
available from  NGOs  but  this  has  to  be  measured  against  the  expert
evidence.  The appellant has relied rather heavily on a report  from  Asylos
and Arc Foundation 2019 and an abstract from  that  report  prepared  by  Mr
David Neal of Counsel to use as  a  training  paper.   I  mean  Mr  Neal  no
disrespect when I say I put little weight  on  anything  he  has  said,  not
because I regard it any way as inherently  unsatisfactory  but  because  the
material on which he was basing his views has been made available to me  and
it is much more sensible  to  look  there.  Contrary  to  a  very  tentative
indication that I gave in the hearing room I do not think that  the  report,
rather than the abstract, was before the First-tier Tribunal.

The Asylos Report is not an  expert  report  but  is  more  analogous  to  a
privately prepared Country of Origin Information report.  It is a digest  of
published articles and opinions.  There are  limitations  in  this  approach
but it a helpful starting point for an informed overview. I accept  that  it
has been prepared honestly.

There is a quotation there from an opinion of Dr  Edlira  Haxhiymeri  in  an
interview in January 2019  when  Dr  Haxhiymeri  said  that  there  were  no
effective programmes from the government for reintegrating  boys  and  young
men.  They did not exist.  Dr Haxhiymeri  was  familiar  with  the  work  of
Different and Equal and respectful of it but she said that she  was  unaware
of Different and Equal "offering and service to men and boys" (page  210  in
bundle). I am doubtful that there is no support at all  because  the  Asylos
Report (again, page 210)  acknowledges  a  US  Department  of  State  report
referring to NGOs supporting male victims,  including  boys.  Dr  Haxhiymeri
has been criticised for allowing years of campaigning to colour  her  vision
(not her integrity) and she may be overstating the case.   It  seems  to  me
very likely that there is something that exists to justify the  findings  in
the US Department of State report  but,  given  Dr  Haxhiymeri's  clear  and
recent ignorance of such support and  I  am  not  persuaded  that  there  is
something that is really available for this appellant.   It  just  might  be
different if there were positive proposals connecting him  directly  with  a
supporting charity but there are none such in this case.

Mr Whitwell, helpfully and  realistically,  drew  my  attention  to  reports
suggesting the situation is  improving  and  that  Albania  is  taking  very
seriously its responsibilities to provide better services.   I  accept  that
but this appeal is about a boy here who has already been trafficked  and  is
highly vulnerable.  I do not regard internal relocation as a  viable  option
in part because I do not see how it can work.  I am  satisfied  there  is  a
real risk of his being directly subjected to  further  re-trafficking.   Re-
trafficking is a real issue.  It is not always clear what the qualities  are
that identify someone as a potential victim but the  appellant  clearly  has
them because a victim is what he is.  It has been  established  that  he  is
not safe in his home area and the situation in Tirana I find  is  altogether
too uncertain.

Given  the  appellant's  history  and  the  establish  links   between   the
traffickers and the police, I am not  satisfied  that  state  protection  is
available to him.

Whilst there is every reason to think that the appellant  has  a  supportive
family any finding that family members could  give  him  the  protection  in
Tirana that  they  could  not  provide  in  his  home  area  would  be  pure
speculation that is not supported by the evidence.

Mr Whitwell contended that the appellant has managed in the  United  Kingdom
so surely he can manage in his own country.  A fallacy of this  argument  is
the implication that it was reasonable for the  appellant  to  come  to  the
United Kingdom.  It was not. It was a very daring and probably  rather  rash
thing to do.  It seems to have worked for this appellant but that is not  at
all the same as saying that it is reasonable.  Also in  the  United  Kingdom
the chances of re-trafficking are significantly less and there is a  clearly
established support network from which the appellant is benefiting  to  help
him stay safe.

Protection claims are invariably about risk rather than certainty.   I  find
the idea of returning a person not yet adult to his country  of  nationality
and expecting him to establish himself in a big city where  traffickers  are
rife and there would be no obvious support for him as almost  self-evidently
unacceptable.  People not  yet  in  adult  life  should  not,  normally,  be
establishing themselves on their own.  The burden of proof is discharged  by
establishing a risk and there is a real risk to his  safety.   I  also  find
that it is  unreasonable  to  expect  him  to  go  to  a  position  of  such
uncertainty even if, happily, it worked out for him.

Although  I  accept  that  improvements  are  being  made  by  the  Albanian
authorities,  I  am  not  persuaded  that  there  is  effective   protection
available to this appellant. Effective protection would need two  things  in
this case.  It would need some support  to  help  him  live  and  I  am  not
satisfied that it is there for him although  it  might  be  there  for  some
people in some circumstances and I  am  not  satisfied  the  police  can  be
relied upon given his history and obvious interest to traffickers.

I have no hesitation in concluding on the information  before  me  that  the
appellant is presently a refugee.

This is not to say he will always be a refugee.  It might be but his  return
could be managed safely after he has achieved his majority  and/or  maturity
on a guided programme with obvious contact and obvious support  and  obvious
place to go in the event of his return but that is not the case before me.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal for error of law.

Having reminded  myself  of  the  low  standard  of  proof  and  appropriate
directions I find that internal relocation is not an option  in  this  case.
It may not work at all and even if it did it would be  unreasonable  because
of the difficulties it would bring for the appellant.   It  follows  that  I
allow the appeal on asylum grounds.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed.  The First-tier Tribunal  erred.   I  set  aside  its
decision and I substitute a decision allowing the appeal on asylum  grounds.
