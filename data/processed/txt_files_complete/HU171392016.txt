For the Respondent:    In person (with the Sponsor, Richard Button)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The respondent (whom I shall refer to as the "claimant") is  a  citizen
    of the Philippines who was born on 12 March  1988.   She  has  on  four
    occasions between August 2013  and  October  2015  been  granted  entry
    clearance to the UK.  In August 2013, September  2014  and  1  November
    2015, she was granted entry clearance as a Tier 5 charity worker.   She
    last entered the United Kingdom as a visitor on 31 October 2015.

 2. On 12 January 2016, the claimant applied for leave  to  remain  on  the
    basis of her relationship with a British citizen, Richard Button.   Her
    application was refused on  29  June  2016.   The  respondent  was  not
    satisfied that the relationship between the claimant and Mr Button  was
    "genuine and subsisting" or had, in any  event,  been  shown  to  be  a
    relationship akin to marriage which had lasted for at least two  years.
    In addition, the Secretary of State concluded that, applying  paragraph
    EX.1. of Appendix FM, the claimant had not established  "insurmountable
    obstacles" to her family life with Mr  Button  continuing  outside  the
    United Kingdom in the Philippines.

 3. The Secretary of State also  concluded  that  the  claimant  could  not
    succeed on the basis of her private life under paragraph 276ADE of  the
    Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The  claimant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Having  heard
    evidence from the claimant and Mr Button, Judge Rowlands was  satisfied
    that their relationship was a genuine and subsisting one.  In addition,
    he noted that since the Secretary of State's decision the claimant  and
    Mr Button had married on 26  October  2016.   Further,  Judge  Rowlands
    concluded, applying paragraph EX.1.  that  there  were  "insurmountable
    obstacles" to their  family  life  being  enjoyed  outside  the  United
    Kingdom.  As a result, Judge Rowlands was satisfied that  the  claimant
    met the requirements of the 'partner' provisions in Appendix FM, namely
    R-LTRP.1.1.(d)(i)  -  (iii)  and  he  allowed  the  appeal  under   the
    Immigration Rules.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 5. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the basis that  the  judge  had,  in  effect,  irrationally
    concluded that there were "insurmountable obstacles"  to  the  claimant
    and Mr Button continuing their family life in the Philippines.

 6. The grounds contended that the judge had found at paragraph 19  of  his
    determination that:

         "The only real obstacle, it seems to me, is his apparent  inability
         to get employment because of his lack  of  language  and,  arguably
         because of his lack of skills".

 7. Nevertheless, the judge had also found at paragraph 18 that:

         "The [claimant] would be living in her home country  and  would  be
         able to return to work in the profession that she is used to.  They
         have family there and will be able to  live  with  her  parents  at
         least in the short term if not longer."

 8. The grounds contend that the  judge's  findings  were  not  capable  of
    amounting to "insurmountable obstacles" which imposed a stringent  test
    set out in para EX.2. that:

         "'Insurmountable obstacles' means the very significant difficulties
         which  would  be  faced  by  the  applicant  or  their  partner  in
         continuing their family life together  outside  the  UK  and  which
         could not be overcome or would entail very serious hardship for the
         applicant or their partner."

 9. On 23 August 2017,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Grant-Hutchison)
    granted the Secretary of State permission to appeal.

10. At the hearing before me, the Secretary of State was represented by  Mr
    Richards.  The claimant appeared in person together with  her  husband,
    Mr Button.  The claimant also submitted a short skeleton argument.

The Submissions

11. Mr Richards maintained the grounds of appeal  and  submitted  that  the
    judge had erred in law in concluding that  there  were  "insurmountable
    obstacles".  He submitted that the totality of the  circumstances  were
    incapable  of  meeting  the  high  threshold  required.   However,   he
    acknowledged that the claimant now met the entry  requirements  of  the
    Rules as a 'partner' in Appendix FM  if  she  were  to  make  an  entry
    clearance application.   There  were  no  issues  concerning  financial
    support and it was  confirmed  that  Mr  Button  earned  in  excess  of
    ï¿½20,000.  I drew to Mr Richards' attention the decision of the House of
    Lords in Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL  40.   Mr  Richards  acknowledged
    that the rationale in Chikwamba applied to the claimant's circumstances
    and that, even if she could not succeed under the Immigration Rules, he
    did not seek to argue that her appeal should not be allowed under Art 8
    of the ECHR.  Mr Richards accepted that if the claimant succeeded under
    Art 8 then she would be at no disadvantage in the  grant  of  leave  to
    her, and in any future application  for  settlement,  compared  to  the
    situation if she  had  succeeded  under  the  Immigration  Rules  as  a
    partner.

12. In the light of this, I explained to the claimant  and  Mr  Button  the
    position taken by Mr Richards.  They agreed that, if the claimant would
    not be disadvantaged if her appeal were allowed under Art 8, they  were
    content that the appeal should be allowed on that basis.

Discussion

13. As a consequence, I can give my reasons for the disposal of this appeal
    relatively briefly.

14. Judge Rowlands accepted that the relationship between Mr Button and the
    claimant was a genuine and subsisting one.   They  are  married;  their
    marriage having taken place on 26  October  2016.   As  a  result,  the
    claimant met the suitability and eligibility requirements for leave  to
    remain as a partner, apart from E-LTRP.2.1 as the claimant is in the UK
    with leave as a visitor (now extended by s.3C of  the  Immigration  Act
    1971).  The appeal should have been dismissed under the Rules  on  that
    basis.

15. However, Judge Rowlands went on to consider whether the  claimant  had,
    as a result  of  R-LTRP.1.1.(d)(iii),  satisfied  the  requirements  of
    paragraph EX.1.  That  required  her  to  establish  that:  "there  are
    insurmountable obstacles to family life with [her]  partner  continuing
    outside the UK."

16. In his decision, Judge Rowlands found in the claimant's favour for  the
    reasons set out at paragraph 19 of his determination as follows:

         "19. The only real obstacle,  it  seems  to  me,  is  his  apparent
             inability to get employment because of his  lack  of  language
             and, arguably because of his lack of skills.  Although I  have
             not been presented with any evidence  to  this  effect,  I  am
             prepared to accept that jobs  for  unskilled  foreign  workers
             would be hard to get in the Philippines.   I  accept  that  he
             could learn the language but that would take some  significant
             time.   I  do  not  however  see  how,  with   his   lack   of
             qualifications, he could  make  himself  employable  within  a
             reasonable time.  I suppose he could improve and  obtain  some
             qualifications  but  that  would  require  him  to  learn  the
             language such that he could do so in college.  With these  two
             things are added together I believe that  they  do  amount  to
             insurmountable obstacles to their family  life  being  enjoyed
             outside the United Kingdom and that she therefore fulfils  the
             requirements under the 10 year partner route."

17. Paragraph EX.2. defines insurmountable obstacles as meaning:

         "the very significant difficulties which  would  be  faced  by  the
         applicant or their partner in continuing their family life together
         outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail very
         serious hardship for the applicant or their partner."

18. In R (Agyarko) and another v SSHD [2017]  UKSC  11  the  Supreme  Court
    concluded that the requirement in the Rules mirrored that  required  by
    the Strasbourg case law in relation to Art 8.  In particular  at  [43],
    Lord Reed stated that:

         "It  appears  that   the   European   Court   intends   the   words
         'insurmountable obstacles' to be  understood  in  a  practical  and
         realistic sense, rather than as referring solely to obstacles which
         make it literally impossible for the family to live together in the
         country of origin of the non-national concerned."

19. Lord Reed went on to state that the  Strasbourg  Court  understood  the
    expression as imposing a 'stringent test'.

20. In this appeal, the only "real obstacle" - to use Judge Rowlands  words
    - was the "apparent inability" of Mr Button to obtain employment in the
    Philippines due to his lack of language and, perhaps, lack  of  skills.
    However, the judge accepted that the claimant, who worked  as  a  nurse
    both in the UK and previously in the  Philippines,  would  be  able  to
    continue  her  employment  there.   The  claimant  had  family  in  the
    Philippines and, despite  the  contrary  being  argued,  there  was  no
    evidence of any danger to  them  in  the  Philippines  where  they  had
    travelled  on   previous   occasions   (see   paragraph   18   of   the
    determination).

21. In my judgment, the mere difficulty in Mr Button  obtaining  employment
    when the claimant would be able to work and finance their living in the
    Philippines where her family lived,  could  not  rationally  amount  to
    "insurmountable obstacles" in the sense set out in paragraph EX.2. that
    there would be "very  significant  difficulties"  which  could  not  be
    overcome or would entail very serious hardship for them.

22. As a result, I accept that the judge  erred  in  law  in  reaching  his
    finding that there were "insurmountable obstacles" to the  family  life
    of the claimant and Mr Button  continuing  in  the  Philippines.   That
    issue could only reasonably be resolved against  the  claimant  on  the
    evidence.

23. Consequently, the judge erred in law in allowing the claimant's  appeal
    under the Rules and, despite his positive findings in relation to their
    relationship, they did not meet the requirements of the Rules in  order
    for the claimant to obtain leave to remain.

24. However, as Mr Richards acknowledged, there is  no  reason  to  believe
    that the claimant would not meet the requirements for  entry  clearance
    as a 'partner' to which the  requirement  in  paragraph  EX.1.  has  no
    application.  I am satisfied that it is very, or  highly,  likely  that
    the claimant, if she returned to the  Philippines,  would  satisfy  the
    Rules (including the financial and  language  requirements)  for  entry
    clearance as a partner.  The sponsor has the required  income  and  the
    judge did not call into question the claimant's  facility  in  English.
    Mr Richards accepted that the rationale in Chikwamba applied.  In  that
    case, the House of Lords accepted that it could be  a  disproportionate
    interference with an individual's family life to require them to  leave
    the UK to seek entry clearance.  To do so, could in itself amount to  a
    disproportionate  interference  with  an  individual's   family   life,
    particularly where to require the individual to leave the UK would only
    be to enforce  the  need  to  seek  entry  clearance  as  a  procedural
    requirement.

25. In my judgment, Mr Richards' acceptance that Chikwamba applied  to  the
    claimant is  well-founded.   Given  the  very  likely  outcome  of  her
    application for  entry  clearance,  and  given  that  the  claimant  is
    lawfully in the UK and that requiring her to go to the  Philippines  to
    seek entry clearance will necessarily impact upon her relationship with
    Mr Button, it would, in my judgment, be pointless to require her to  do
    so.  It would, in my judgment, be requiring her to leave the UK  simply
    to comply with the procedural requirement of  seeking  entry  clearance
    from abroad.  There is every reason to believe - and  Mr  Richards  did
    not seek  to  contend  otherwise  -  that  she  meets  the  substantive
    requirements of the Rules which would allow her entry as a  partner  of
    Mr Button.

26. In Agyarko, Lord Reed at [51] reaffirmed that:

         "If, on the other hand, an applicant - even if residing in  the  UK
         unlawfully - was otherwise certain to be granted leave to enter, at
         least if an application were made from outside the UK,  then  there
         might be no public interest in his or her removal."

27. Lord Reed stated that the point was  illustrated  by  the  decision  in
    Chikwamba.

28. In my judgment, the public interest in  effective  immigration  control
    set out in s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002
    is weak in this case.  The claimant is not  dependent  upon  the  state
    financially and speaks English.   Section  117B(2)  and  (3)  are  not,
    therefore, engaged against her.  Whilst I accept that her  family  life
    was formed when her  immigration  status  was  precarious  (though  not
    unlawful), the precise weight to be given to it must  depend  upon  the
    circumstances.  Here, in the realm of Chikwamba, the weight to be given
    to it must be seen in the context of the interference by requiring  the
    claimant temporarily to leave the UK in order to seek  entry  clearance
    as  a  procedural  requirement.     Taking   into   account   all   the
    circumstances, I am satisfied that the claimant's removal in  order  to
    seek entry clearance (which she is very  likely  or  highly  likely  to
    obtain) as a partner, would result in a  disproportionate  interference
    with her family life with  Mr  Button.   Consequently,  and  for  these
    reasons, I find that the Secretary of State's decision breaches  Art  8
    of the ECHR.



Decision

29. Consequently, the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  allow  the
    claimant's appeal under the Immigration Rules involved the making of an
    error of law and is set aside.

30. I remake the decision dismissing the appeal under the Immigration Rules
    but allowing the appeal outside the Rules under Art 8 of the ECHR.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have allowed the appeal under Art 8 but this has been as a consequence  of
matters arising since the decision and  in  the  light  of  that  I  do  not
consider it appropriate to make a fee award in the claimant's favour.
