                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL

1.   The Respondent is a national of Somalia. He entered the United  Kingdom
    with his mother and four siblings on 11 July  2001,  when  he  was  ten
    years old. His mother's application for asylum was refused but she  and
    her children were granted exceptional leave to remain for a year on  24
    August  2001.  She  applied  for  further  leave  to  remain,  but  her
    application was refused in  February  2004.  Her  appeal  against  this
    decision was allowed on 6 September 2004 and on 19 October 2006 she and
    her children were granted asylum  until  17  October  2011  and  on  24
    November 2011 they were all granted indefinite leave to remain  in  the
    United Kingdom.

2.   Between 16 October 2012 and 14  July  2014,  the  Respondent  had  nine
    convictions for 13 offences. and 6 February 2017 he was convicted of  3
    public order offences. These included two counts  of  possession  of  a
    Class B drug and one count of possession of  a  Class  A  drug,  namely
    heroin. In addition, on 14 July 2014 he  was  convicted  of  one  count
    possession of a Class A drug, namely  crack  cocaine,  with  intent  to
    supply, one count of possession of a Class A drug, namely  heroin,  and
    also of having a bladed article in a public place. He was sentenced  to
    3 years imprisonment in total for these three offences.

3.   The Respondent was served with a decision to make a  deportation  order
    on 3 June 2015 and 7 March 2016 he asserted that his deportation  would
    amount to a breach of his human rights.  His  human  rights  claim  was
    refused and the decision to deport him was maintained  on  22  December
    2017. He appealed against this decision and First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Blundell allowed his appeal on  human  rights  grounds  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 14 August 2018. However, when doing so he found that the
    Appellant had not rebutted the presumption that he represented a danger
    to the community for the purposes of section  72  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. He also found that it was  lawful  for
    the Appellant to cease his entitlement to Refugee status.

4.   The Appellant sought permission to appeal against this decision. First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Saffer refused  him  permission  to  appeal  on  29
    August 2018. However, Upper Tribunal Judge Gill granted him  permission
    to appeal on 16 November 2018.





ERROR OF LAW HEARING

5.   The Home Office  Presenting  Officer  submitted  that  the  grounds  of
    appeal raised a narrow but  determinative  issue  and  that  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Blundell had failed to give  sufficient  weight  to  the
    factual findings made by the Upper Tribunal in MOJ  &  Ors  (Return  to
    Mogadishu) Somalia CG [2014] UKUT 00442 (IAC) in relation to access  to
    financial support and the existence of  a  Facilitated  Return  Scheme.
    The Respondent's legal representative  took  me  through  the  relevant
    paragraphs of the decision before submitting that the decision  reached
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge Blundell was one which was open to him  on
    the evidence before him.

ERROR OF LAW DECISION

6.    As  the  Respondent  had  been  sentenced  to  at  least   12   months
    imprisonment, he was liable to deportation under section 32 of  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007.

7.   Section 117C (1) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002
    states that:

         "the deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest"

8.   Section 117 C (2) states that:

         "The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,  the
         greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal"

9.   Section 117C (3) states that:

         "in the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been sentenced
         to a period of imprisonment of  four  years  or  more,  the  public
         interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or Exception 2
         applies.

10.  Section 117C (4) states that:

         "Exception 1 applies where-


             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,


             (b)  C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and


             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
             integration into the country to which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported".

11.  Paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules states that:

         "Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary  to
         the  UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the   Human   Rights
         Convention, and ...


         (b)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
         public good and in the  public  interest  because  they  have  been
         convicted of an offence for which they have been  convicted  of  an
         offence for  which  they  have  been  sentenced  for  a  period  of
         imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12 months ...


         the Secretary of State in assessing the claim will consider whether
         paragraph 399 or 399A applies and,  if  it  does  not,  the  public
         interest in deportation will only be outweighed  by  other  factors
         where there are other very compelling circumstances over and  above
         those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A"

12.  In a very detailed  and  cogent  decision,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Blundell correctly upheld the certificate issued under  section  72  of
    the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,  found  that  the
    Appellant was entitled to cease the  Respondent's  refugee  status  and
    that he was not entitled to Humanitarian Protection. He also found that
    his deportation would not amount to  a  breach  of  Article  3  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights. The Respondent has not  sought  to
    cross appeal any of these decisions.

13.  I have also noted that, in paragraph 58 of his decision,  having  found
    that the Respondent had established that he  met  the  requirements  of
    Exception 1, he  stated  that  he  reached  "that  conclusion  with  no
    particular enthusiasm - not least because I  have  concluded  that  the
    appellant represents a danger to the community of  the  UK"  but  added
    "but it is the result required by statute".

14.  It was not disputed that the Respondent had been lawfully  resident  in
    the United Kingdom for most of his life. He entered  when  he  was  ten
    years old and he was twenty-seven years old at the date of  the  appeal
    hearing and, whilst  in  the  United  Kingdom,  he  had  had  temporary
    admission following his mother's application  for  asylum,  exceptional
    leave to remain or indefinite leave to remain.

15.  The Home Office Presenting Officer relied on the finding  in  paragraph
    (x) of MOJ that:

         "...it will be for the person facing return to explain why he would
         not be able to access the economic  opportunities  that  have  been
         produced by the economic boom [in Somalia], especially as there  is
         evidence that returnees are taking jobs at the expense of those who
         have never been away".

16.  When granting permission to appeal, Upper Tribunal  Judge  Gill  stated
    that:

         "It is arguable that, in reaching [his finding about whether  there
         would be very significant obstacles to the Appellant's  integration
         into Mogadishu] the judge may have erred to take into  account  the
         fact that the appellant would  be  able  to  take  advantage  of  a
         reintegration package". She added that it was arguable  "that  this
         omission is material given the judge's other  findings  (e.g.  that
         the appellant has some experiences in the UK job  marker  and  may,
         given time, be able to secure employment in Mogadishu".

17.  As the Home Office Presenting Officer submitted, there  was  a  box  at
    the bottom of the letter sent by the Appellant to the Respondent, dated
    4  December  2017,  which  drew  the  Respondent's  attention  to   the
    Facilitated Return Scheme by which a person who was making a  voluntary
    return may be entitled to a reintegration package worth �1500 or �750.

18.  However, when reaching the decision under appeal,  the  Respondent  did
    not rely on the existence of such an integration package  or  paragraph
    423 of MOJ & Ors (Return to Modadishu) Somalia  CG  [2014]  UKUT  00442
    (IAC). In addition, at the appeal hearing the  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer did not rely upon the availability of such a  package  and  the
    Respondent was not asked any questions about his ability to access  any
    such package or shat level of entitlement he may be able to apply  for.
    Therefore, the Respondent was not  provided  with  any  opportunity  to
    respond to any assertion that he would  be  able  to  rely  on  such  a
    package and was deprived of his proper opportunity to respond  to  this
    part of the case now being made against him.

19.  Furthermore, the head note in MOJ & Ors, which summarises  the  country
    guidance being provided by the Upper Tribunal, does not refer  to  this
    package and paragraph 423 does not go any further than to state that:

         "... Financial assistance from the Home Office may be available  to
         voluntary returnees, in the form of a grant of up to �1,500 and may
         of significant assistance to a returnee".

20.  There was  no  suggestion  that  such  financial  assistance  would  be
    available in all cases or in a case similar to that of the Respondent.

21.  Therefore, the failure by First-tier Tribunal Judge Blundell  to  refer
    to this package was not a material error of law in the context  of  the
    country guidance or the case argued before him.

22.  Upper Tribunal Judge Gill did not grant permission  to  appeal  on  any
    wider basis. But at the hearing before me the  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer sought to rely on other parts of the grounds of appeal. For the
    purposes of completeness, I have considered his arguments  relating  to
    the ability of the Respondent to  access  employment  in  Mogadishu  as
    someone with skills acquired in the United Kingdom.

23.  In paragraph 56 of his  decision  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Blundell
    gave consideration to whether the  Respondent  would  be  able  to  re-
    integrate into Somalian society and, when doing, he relied on Secretary
    of State for the Home Department v SC (Jamaica) t [2017] EWCA Civ  2112
    where the Senior President of the Tribunals found that:

         "61. The same broad approach should apply  to  the  analysis  of  a
         foreign criminal's integration into the  country  to  which  he  is
         proposed that he be deported.  In Kamara v Secretary of  State  for
         the Home Department [2016] 4 WLR 152 Sales LJ (with whom Moore-Bick
         LJ agreed) held at [14] that:


             "[T]he concept of a foreign criminal's "integration" into  the
             country to which it is proposed that he be  deported,  as  set
             out in section 117C(4)(c) and paragraph 399A, is a broad  one.
             It is not confined to the mere ability to find  a  job  or  to
             sustain life while living in the  other  country.  It  is  not
             appropriate to treat the statutory language as subject to some
             gloss and it  will  usually  be  sufficient  for  a  court  or
             tribunal simply to direct itself in the terms that  Parliament
             has chosen to use. The idea of "integration" calls for a broad
             evaluative judgment to be made as to  whether  the  individual
             will be enough of an insider in  terms  of  understanding  how
             life in the society in that other country is carried on and  a
             capacity to participate in it, so  as  to  have  a  reasonable
             opportunity to be accepted there, to be able to operate  on  a
             day-to-day basis in that society and  to  build  up  within  a
             reasonable time a  variety  of  human  relationships  to  give
             substance to the individual's private or family life".

24.  In paragraph 63, he added that:

         "The Secretary of State  is  right  to  point  out  that  financial
         dependency and criminal convictions, if evaluated, may  indicate  a
         lack of integration.   The FtT was equally entitled to  find  facts
         about SC's traumatic history, the duration of his lawful residence,
         his attendance at school in the UK, his recent progress to turn his
         life around and the family life that he  had  enjoyed  in  the  UK.
         Those  are  all  relevant  to  social  and  cultural   integration.
         Likewise, the FtT's findings of fact about the  age  that  SC  left
         Jamaica, the torture he experienced and  his  need  for  specialist
         mental health therapy are relevant to whether there would  be  very
         significant obstacles to his integration in Jamaica".

25.  In paragraph 57 of his  decision  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Blundell
    followed the Court of Appeal's guidance closely and found that:

         "... [the Respondent] has some experience in the UK job marker  and
         he may, given time, be able to secure employment there. [But] given
         the [Respondent's] complete lack of familiarity with Mogadishu  and
         his status as a minority clansman, he will  be  in  a  particularly
         difficult position. He cannot call on financial support from the UK
         and there is no one in Somali who would be in a position to provide
         any such support. It is more likely than not that the  [Respondent]
         would find himself in an IDP camp for  the  foreseeable  future  on
         return. Whilst the conditions in such a camp do not reach the  high
         threshold required to  establish  a  breach  of  Article  3,  I  do
         consider that the [Respondent]  would  encounter  very  significant
         obstacles to integration into Somali".

26.  I have reminded myself that in Kamara the core test was that:

         "The idea of "integration" calls for a broad evaluative judgment to
         be made as to whether the individual will be enough of  an  insider
         in terms of understanding how life in the  society  in  that  other
         country is carried on and a capacity to participate in it, so as to
         have a reasonable opportunity to be accepted there, to be  able  to
         operate on a day-to-day basis in  that  society  and  to  build  up
         within a reasonable time a variety of human relationships  to  give
         substance to the individual's private or family life"

27.  Furthermore, in a well-structured decision  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Blundell distinguished between a right to protection  which  may  arise
    from Article 3 of the European Convention on Human  Rights  or  article
    15C of the Qualification Directive and which was  the  subject  of  the
    country guidance provided in MOJ & Ors  and whether he had been able to
    establish that  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
    integration into life in Mogadishu for the purposes of Article 8 of the
    European Convention on Human Rights.

28.  As a consequence, I  find  that  the  decision  reached  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Blundell was one which was open to him in the  light  of
    the evidence and the relevant case law.
Decision
 (1) The appeal is dismissed.
 (2) The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Blundell stands.
