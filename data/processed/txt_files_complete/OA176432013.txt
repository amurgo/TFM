                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Warren L Grant, promulgated on 18th September 2014,  following  a
    hearing at Taylor House on 11th September 2014.  In the  determination,
    the judge dismissed the appeal of Samuel Opoku-Kufuour.  The  Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Ghana, who was born on 11th  July
    1969.  He applied for leave to enter  the  UK  as  the  spouse  of  Mrs
    Lillian Akosua Attipoe, a British citizen, present and settled  in  the
    UK.  The Respondent Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that  the
    Appellant and the Sponsor were parties to  a  subsisting  marriage,  or
    that they intended to live with one another permanently as husband  and
    wife.  Nor, was the Respondent Entry Clearance Officer  satisfied  that
    the Appellant met the  financial  requirements,  or  that  he  met  the
    English language requirement.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant referred to the birth of her daughter as proof  that  his
    marriage was subsisting and genuine.  He  referred  to  his  BA  degree
    awarded by the University of Ghana on 14th June 2008,

         "Along with a letter from  the  university  dated  25th  June  2012
         stating that the courses were taught in the English language.   The
         letter went on to state that the Appellant had been  in  taught  in
         English since school days and that he has proven oral  and  written
         skills in English enabling him to pursue a course in his field with
         English..." (paragraph 8 of the judge's determination).

    He referred to his sponsoring wife's earned income  of  �20,924.79,  to
    her pay slips, as well as her  P60,  sent  with  the  application  (see
    paragraph 14 of the determination).  These were the Sponsor's  earnings
    as at 31st March 2013.  However, after a period of maternity leave, the
    Sponsor went back to work on 1st October 2013  and  the  earnings  here
    showed her to be in receipt  of  �27,000  per  year  as  a  nurse  (see
    paragraph 14 of the determination).

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge had little difficulty  in  accepting  most  of  the  evidence
    presented before the Tribunal.  In what is a careful, sympathetic,  and
    well crafted determination, the judge held that "the marriage is not in
    issue and on the basis of the copious evidence (not  challenged  by  Mr
    Staunton) including the birth of a daughter I find that  the  Appellant
    and the Sponsor are parties to  a  valid  and  subsisting  marriage..."
    (paragraph 7).  Secondly, the judge  held  that  with  respect  to  the
    financial requirement that, "I am unable to find from what is before me
    that at the  date  of  the  decision  the  Appellant  met  the  funding
    requirement" (paragraph 14).  Third, however,  the  difficulty  lay  in
    relation to proof  of  the  Appellant's  English  language  requirement
    evidence.

 5. Although  the  Appellant  had  relied  upon  his  BA  degree  from  the
    University of Ghana on 14th June 2008, he  had  only  subsequently  had
    confirmation  of  the  level  of  attainment  in  this  foreign  degree
    qualification for English, by a letter dated 18th June  2014  "from  UK
    NARIC to the Appellant confirming that the level  of  English  language
    for his degree is considered to meet the  requirements  of  CEFR  level
    C1."  (See paragraph 11).

 6. The judge heard arguments from Mr Olawanle, who also  appeared  in  the
    Tribunal below, that the letter from UK NARIC reflected  the  situation
    at the date of the decision.  However, as the judge reasoned, "if  that
    letter from UK NARIC had been supplied as it should have been  supplied
    with the application we would not  be  here  today.   If  it  had  been
    supplied with the Grounds of Appeal it would  surely  have  been  taken
    into account ..." (see  paragraph  12).   Furthermore,  "there  was  no
    knowing what NARIC would decide about the Appellant's degree until they
    actually put pen to paper.  They might have  ruled  totally  conversely
    about it ..." (paragraph 13).

 7. Therefore, the position would not have been clear, in the way contended
    for by Mr Olawanle, when it first arose for a decision before the Entry
    Clearance Officer.  It was  for  the  Appellant  to  have  put  in  the
    evidence.  If the evidence had not been put  in  by  the  time  of  the
    decision, then it could  not  be  relied  upon.   On  this  basis,  the
    Appellant's appeal could not succeed.  The judge did not  give  further
    consideration to Article 8 ECHR rights.

Grounds of Application

 8. In the grounds of application, it is said that the judge failed to take
    into  account  Article  8  ECHR.   When  the  matter  first  came   for
    consideration of the application before the First-tier Tribunal on 24th
    November 2014, it was held that, "it would have been desirable for  the
    judge to have mentioned Article 8.  The grounds are correct in that  it
    does not".  However, the error was not material.  On a  renewal  before
    the Upper Tribunal, UTJ Grubb held that,

         "The Appellant  also  raised  Article  8  and  the  judge  has  not
         considered that at all.  That is an arguable  error  of  law.   The
         Appellant has a wife and child in the UK and  despite  not  meeting
         the English language requirement of the Rules,  or  apparently  all
         the other requirements, I cannot say that the Article 8 claim would
         inevitably fail" (see paragraph 2).

    Permission to appeal was granted.

 9. On 22nd April 2015 a Rule 24 response was entered to  the  effect  that
    UTJ Grubb had only granted permission on the basis of  the  Appellant's
    Article 8 claim.  However, there was no material error of law in  Judge
    Grant's decision.  This was because the Appellant had not shown that he
    met the requirements of the Rules and Article  8  is  not  a  means  to
    circumvent the Rules.  Should the Appellant  wish  to  pursue  a  claim
    under Article 8 he should do so by submitting a fresh application.

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 28th May 2015, Mr  Olawanle,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant, submitted that I should make a finding  of  an
    error of law, for the failure of the judge below to consider Article 8,
    and to then proceed and remake the decision, because the  evidence  was
    cogent and convincing that the Appellant deserved  to  succeed  in  his
    appeal.  This was for the following reasons.

11. First, if one looked at the skeleton argument for the judge (at page 4)
    there is an express reference to the refusal decision  amounting  to  a
    breach of private and family life under  Article  8.   Second,  if  one
    looks at paragraph 3 of the  First-tier  Tribunal's  rejection  of  the
    application for permission, there is an express recognition  that,  "it
    would have been desirable for the judge to have mentioned  Article  8".
    Third, the Rule 24 response itself states (at paragraph 5) that, "it is
    not evident from the documents available when producing  this  response
    that the Appellant set out his case for  an  Article  8  claim  in  his
    application...".

12. However, this was plainly not the case because an email  sent  on  18th
    February  2014  (which  I  have  seen  in  this  Tribunal)  to  Mr   PS
    (restricted) on the email on
    [ - ]@fco.gov.uk by the Appellant's sponsoring wife is  to  the  effect
    that she is going to have an emergency caesarean operation and that, "a
    caesarean section can be daunting for most women who go through it  and
    it is essential I have a proper support system in place..."  The  email
    is accordingly written, "just to make you aware that  your  office  has
    not yet contacted my husband Samuel Opoku-Kufuour regarding  his  entry
    clearance to the UK...".  She ends the email by  emphasising  that,  "I
    with to reiterate that I am alone, I haven't got family members here at
    the moment and it is critical that my  husband  comes  by  Monday  24th
    February 2014 to offer me support needed".  That  email,  submitted  Mr
    Olawanle, was ignored by the Entry Clearance Officer, and clearly raise
    Article 8 concerns.  A failure to consider Article  8  was  a  material
    error of law in these circumstances.

13. Mr Olawanle then submitted that, subject to my finding an error of law,
    I should proceed to remake the decision.  He relied upon the  following
    submissions.  First, the Appellant complied with all  the  requirements
    of the Rules except the English language  requirement.   However,  upon
    closer examination, it was explained that he did meet this  requirement
    as well.  This is because he was not relying upon the confirmation from
    the NARIC authorities, which was given  on  18th  June  2014  that  his
    English language standard met with the requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules.

14. Rather, what he was relying upon was his BA degree certificate from the
    University of Ghana.  That document had always been  before  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer, and it had always been before every other  authority
    who had occasion to look at it.  All that the NARIC  document  does  on
    18th June 2014 is to confirm that the "title of award", which is  given
    as "bachelor of arts in social work with information studies",  is  one
    which can be given the "evaluation" of, "the level of English  language
    for the above degree course is considered to meet the  requirements  of
    CEFR level C1".

15. This document (which appears at page 35 of the Appellant's bundle)  was
    opposed to facto confirmation of evidence that was already  before  the
    authorities in its original form.  In these  circumstances  it  plainly
    was evidence that was "appertaining" to the date of the  decision  (see
    DR (ECO: post-decision evidence) Morocco [2005] UKIAT 00038).   Second,
    if one looks at the case law, it is plain that this  is  one  of  those
    appeals that deserves to succeed.  Mr Olwanle relied  upon  the  recent
    case of Adjei (visit visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT 0261  (IAC).   This
    makes it clear in the headnote that, "if  Article  8  is  engaged,  the
    Tribunal may need to look at the extent to which the claimant  is  said
    to have failed to meet the requirements of the Rule  because  that  may
    inform the proportionality balancing exercise that must follow".   This
    is confirmed at paragraph 9 of the determination.

16. Furthermore, the case of Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance)  [2015]
    UKUT 112, confirms the principle that there are  "a  limited  class  of
    cases" where Article 8(1) is engaged in such a way as to make a refusal
    decision disproportionate.  It is  made  clear  that,  "if  a  person's
    circumstances do satisfy the Immigration Rules and they have not  acted
    in a way that undermines the system of immigration control,  a  refusal
    of entry clearance is liable  to  infringe  Article  8".   Mr  Olawanle
    submitted that this was one of those "limited class of cases".

17. Mr Olawanle also relied upon the case of Mostafa (Article  8  in  entry
    clearance) [2015] UKUT 112 for the principle  that,  "it  is  the  very
    essence of Article 8 that it lays on fundamental values that have to be
    considered in all relevant cases" and which emphasises the  point  that
    in a limited class of cases "where the relationship is that of  husband
    and wife or other close life  partners"  a  decision  to  refuse  entry
    clearance would violate Article 8 (see paragraph 24).

18. For his part, Mr  Kandola  submitted  that  permission  to  appeal  was
    limited only to Article 8.  The  narrow  issue  here  was  whether  the
    Appellant had complied with the Rules.  He did not.   Judge  Grant  had
    carefully referred to the fact that the  relevant  evidence  about  the
    Appellant's educational attainments was not before the ECO or the  ECM.
    There was a six month gap during which time the relevant evidence could
    have been submitted.  Yet it was not.  Mr Kandola drew my attention  to
    the recent case of SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 which refers  to  the
    existence of relationships having been "performed under  conditions  of
    no precariousness ..."  (see  paragraph  37).   The  proper  course  of
    action, submitted Mr Kandola, was for the Appellant, who complied  with
    every other matter under the Rules  any  way,  to  simply  make  a  new
    application so that his English language  evidence  could  be  properly
    considered on the basis of the NARIC certificate.

19. In reply, Mr Olawanle submitted that SS (Congo) was not an  appropriate
    authority for the present case because it  referred  to  the  need  for
    compelling  circumstances   and   exceptional   circumstances   to   be
    demonstrated with regards to cases that were quite different.  In  this
    case, the Appellant had always relied upon his BA  degree  from  Ghana.
    The main question was whether it would be  proportionate  to  make  his
    family go through the entire process again, in circumstances which  are
    set out in the Grounds of Appeal where his wife makes it clear that she
    does not have the funds and has had to return back to work very quickly
    after the birth of her child, rather than to simply recognise the  fact
    that the Appellant does  meet  with  the  requirements  of  the  Rules.
    Proportionality was a sensible way of looking at the facts here.  A  BA
    degree certificate which had always been before the ECO cannot  be  the
    basis for requiring this  particular  Appellant  to  apply  again  from
    overseas during which time his wife is unable to have him here when she
    much needs him with a young child in the house.  The child is presently
    being looked after by a childminder and it had always been  the  wife's
    intention that her husband should play that role as her Sponsor.   This
    was a limited class of case and would not open the flood gates.

Error of Law

20. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision and remake the decision
    (see Section12(2) of TCEA 2007).  My reasons are follows.

21. It is plain that the Article 8 issue was before the judge and  was  not
    considered.  It was in the skeleton argument of Mr  Olawanle.   It  was
    raised before the Entry Clearance Officer in an email to Peter Scott on
    18th February 2014.  It was  recognised  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    which  refused  the  initial  permission  to  appeal  application,   as
    something that ought to have  been  considered.   Most  importantly  in
    circumstances where the Appellant satisfied all the  requirements,  and
    the  basis  of  the  claim  that  he  satisfied  the  English  language
    requirement was his BA certificate from the University of Ghana, rather
    than some other document, it was important to  apply  the  Rule  in  DR
    (Morocco) because the subsequent evidence from NARIC  plainly  was  one
    that was "appertaining" to the date of the decision, which was focussed
    upon the BA certificate from the University of Ghana.  The  failure  to
    consider Article 8, in  what  is  otherwise  a  determination  of  some
    considerable skill and care, amounts to a material error of law.

Remaking the Decision

22. I remade the decision on the basis of  the  findings  of  the  original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing this appeal for the following reasons.

23. First, this is a case which properly attracts the jurisprudence set out
    by UTJ Southern in the recent Tribunal determination  of  Adjei  (visit
    visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT 20261.  That confirms that once  Article
    8 is engaged, the Tribunal will need to look at the extent to which the
    claimant is said to have failed to meet the requirements  of  the  Rule
    because that will inform the proportionality  balancing  exercise  that
    must follow.

24. Second, in doing so, it is plain that this particular case  belongs  to
    "the limited class of cases" where a  refusal  of  entry  clearance  is
    "liable to infringe Article 8" (see Mostafa) at paragraph  24).   Adjei
    confirms the early jurisprudence of Mostafa  (at  paragraph  24)  that,
    when one is dealing "with the very narrow range  of  claimants",  which
    are limited to cases "where the relationship is  that  of  husband  and
    wife or other close life partners", the position may well  be  entirely
    different.

25. Third, if the reliance in this case was upon the BA degree  certificate
    from the University of Ghana, and which,  even  at  its  very  earliest
    stages was supported "along with a letter  from  the  university  dated
    25th June 2012 stating that the courses  were  taught  in  the  English
    language" (see paragraph 8 of the determination of Judge  Grant),  then
    the confirmation of that degree certificate by UK NARIC  on  18th  June
    2014, was a matter which called for the application of DR (Morocco).

26. In those circumstances, and taking the position in its entirety, it  is
    difficult to see why the decision to refuse is not  a  disproportionate
    one.  One only has to go through the five stage  approach  set  out  by
    Lord Bingham in Razgar to see why this is so.

27. First, the decision interferes with the Appellant's  right  to  respect
    for his family life.

28. Second, it has consequences of such gravity as to engage the  operation
    of Article 8.

29. Third, the decision is not in accordance with the law if the law  under
    DR (Morocco) required the taking into account of the UK NARIC  evidence
    because it related to the BA degree certificate.  But even if  this  is
    not the case, and I am prepared to allow for the possibility that it is
    not the case, the  fourth  reason  is  that  the  interference  is  not
    necessary in a democratic society because  it  does  not  infringe  the
    protection of the rights and  freedoms  of  others  because  this  case
    belongs to a narrow category of cases which are very specific.

30. But most importantly, the fifth requirement is  that  the  interference
    must be proportionate to the legitimate public end that is sought to be
    achieved.  In this case, if the Appellant were to apply  again  on  the
    basis of the UK NARIC certificate, it is beyond per adventure  that  he
    would succeed and it makes no sense whatsoever to require him to do so.



31. This is because as the handwritten Grounds  of  Appeal  make  it  quite
    clear the Appellant has a 9 month old daughter who was born in the  UK.
    His wife "is struggling with her baby on her own as a  single  parent".
    If a fresh application were to be made then,

         "My wife has to work for a while and it would take between  six  to
         nine  months  for  an  application  to  be  made  and   considered.
         Moreover, the financial demands of a fresh application  will  be  a
         further drain on the family's income having  spent  a  lot  in  the
         previous application..."

    On the facts of this case, none of this is justified.  This  appeal  is
    allowed.

Notice of Decision
