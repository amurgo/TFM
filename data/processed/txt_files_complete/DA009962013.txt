                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   Mr Naitini, a native of Fiji, enlisted in  the  British  Army  in  July
    2008, which rendered him  exempt  from  immigration  control.   He  had
    signed up for a twelve-year stint, and had served a tour of  duty  with
    the Royal Welch Fusiliers in Afghanistan when  his  promising  military
    career was cut short.  He was discharged from the Army  in  June  2012,
    following his conviction of a serious offence.  He was found guilty  of
    causing grievous bodily harm to a  young  woman  when  they  were  both
    drunk, and she had apparently taunted him.  A sentence was passed of 2ï¿½
    years in prison.

2.   This sentence rendered Mr Naitini  liable  to  'automatic  deportation'
    under section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007, and a deportation order
    was duly made on 3rd May 2013.  An appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    came before a panel comprising Judge Crawford and Mr  Armitage  on  9th
    August, when oral evidence was taken from  Mr  Naitini  and  his  girl-
    friend, Sarah McLaughlin.  The appeal was allowed under  Article  8  of
    the European Convention on Human Rights, an outcome which is habitually
    challenged by the Secretary of State.   Permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal was granted by Judge Cheales, and so the matter has come
    before us today.

3.   At the outset of the hearing  we  indicated  that  three  of  the  four
    paragraphs setting out the grounds of appeal could now  be  discounted.
    The first two expressed disagreement  with  the  'two  stage'  approach
    adumbrated by the Upper Tribunal in MF (Nigeria) and since followed  in
    a line of other  cases.   The  two-stage  approach  has  recently  been
    endorsed by the Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA  Civ  1192,
    which means that, where an appellant fails to satisfy the provisions of
    paragraphs 398-399A of the Immigration Rules in resisting  deportation,
    tribunal judges should go on to consider the appeal  within  the  wider
    ambit of Article 8, as expounded by Strasbourg and by  our  own  senior
    courts.  That is what the panel did here.

4.   The third  paragraph  complained  that  the  panel  had  conducted  "an
    inquisitorial analysis" into the best interests  of  Mr  Naitini's  two
    British children, in a manner deprecated by Lord  Justice  Laws  in  SS
    (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550.  That complaint is ill-founded.  Laws LJ
    did indeed say that "the circumstances in  which  the  tribunal  should
    exercise an inquisitorial  function  on  its  own  initiative  will  be
    extremely rare", but this was with reference to the sort of inquisition
    advocated by HHJ Thornton in Tinizaray, where the tribunal was urged to
    answer the questions set out in the 'check list' at section  1  of  the
    Children Act 1989, and if necessary conduct its own inquiries in  order
    to find the answers.  In AA (Iran) [2013] EWCA Civ 1523 Maurice Kay  LJ
    has recently remarked that "Tinizaray should receive its quietus."  The
    panel here did not follow Tinizaray.

5.   That left only the fourth paragraph  of  the  grounds,  which  contends
    that the panel did  not  give  adequate  consideration  to  the  public
    interest, in particular "the  need  to  deter  others  and  to  prevent
    serious crime generally and to uphold the  public  abhorrence  of  such
    offending."  Mr Harrison very fairly acknowledged that the challenge to
    the 'two stage' approach had now fallen away, and that it was only  the
    First-tier Tribunal's assessment of the public interest  when  carrying
    out the proportionality balancing  exercise  which  could  arguably  be
    regarded as legally erroneous.

6.   We did not need to hear from Mr Royston, since it was clear to us  that
    the First-tier panel had given proper and adequate consideration to the
    public interest when weighing the competing factors in  the  Article  8
    balance.  They were well  aware  of  the  seriousness  of  the  offence
    committed by the appellant, describing it as "appalling conduct,  which
    is totally unacceptable in a civilised society."   While  dealing  with
    the  best  interests  of  Mr  Naitini's  two  children  as  'a  primary
    consideration', they recognised  that  "there  are  some  circumstances
    where the offence is so serious that  deportation  outweighs  the  best
    interests of the children."  They acknowledged in terms that there  was
    "a strong argument that  [the  appellant]  should  be  deported."   But
    having found there to be no evidence  that  Mr  Naitini  constituted  a
    danger to the public or that he was  likely  to  re-offend,  the  panel
    concluded that the many factors weighing in Mr Naitini's favour  (which
    we have not  listed  here)  outweighed  the  public  interest,  in  the
    particular circumstances of the case.

7.   This was a conclusion which the panel were plainly entitled  to  reach,
    on the  evidence  before  them.   Among  the  factors  weighing  in  Mr
    Naitini's favour was his service with the British Army in  Afghanistan.
    As emphasized by politicians of all hues, the public  owes  a  debt  of
    gratitude to those who have risked life and limb protecting  the  vital
    interests of this country in such a dangerous theatre of war.  This was
    a factor which rightly  added  weight  to  Mr  Naitini's  side  of  the
    balance.  We might also observe that the violent outburst which  caused
    Mr Naitini to end up  in  prison  was  not  the  sort  of  premeditated
    wickedness - such as drug dealing, robbery and burglary - that  rightly
    triggers the deportation of foreign criminals, but a 'one off'  act  of
    aggression which, on the evidence before the panel, was  unlikely  ever
    to happen again.  In fine, the panel made no error of law.



     DECISION

     The determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  upheld,  and  the
    Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.
