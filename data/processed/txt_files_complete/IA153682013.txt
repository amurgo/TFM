Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Owolabi, Samuel and Co Solictors
For the Respondent:    Ms Vidyadharan, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on the  13th  January  1988.
    She is married to Jude Emeke Iloene, also a citizen of Nigeria, born on
    the 9th June 1974.  The Appellant appeals with permission the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Walker),  who  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 5th November 2013, dismissed the appeal of her  husband,
    who was  the  principal  appellant,  and  this  appellant,  who  was  a
    dependant  of  her  husband's  application,  against  the  Respondent's
    refusal to vary their leave to remain in the United Kingdom as  Tier  1
    (General) Migrants.

 2. By way of background, there were originally two appellants  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal; the principal appellant who
    was Mr Jude Emeka Iloene and his wife, the present appellant, who was a
    dependant to his application.

 3.  The history of the appeal is as follows. Mr Iloene entered the  United
    Kingdom with entry clearance as a student on 7th September  2003  which
    was valid until 31st October 2004.  Thereafter he was  granted  further
    periods of  limited  leave  as  a  student  until  5th  February  2010.
    Following this he was granted limited leave to  remain  on  23rd  March
    2010 as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant which expired on 23rd March 2013.

 4. The Appellant, his wife, applied for and was granted leave to enter the
    UK as a Tier 1 (General) dependent partner on 15th December 2012  until
    23rd March 2013.

 5. On 22nd March 2013 her husband made an application for indefinite leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom on the basis  that  he  had  lived  and
    worked in the United Kingdom continuously and  lawfully  for  the  last
    five years under paragraph 245CD of the Immigration Rules (as amended).

 6. In  a  notice  of  immigration  decision  dated  18th  April  2013  the
    application for leave to remain was refused under paragraph 245CD(d) of
    the Immigration Rules.  That Rule stated:-

         "245CD.  Requirements for indefinite leave to remain

         To qualify for indefinite leave  to  remain,  a  Tier  1  (General)
         Migrant must meet the requirements listed below.  If the  applicant
         meets these  requirements,  indefinite  leave  to  remain  will  be
         granted.  If the applicant does not meet  these  requirements,  the
         application will be refused.

         Requirements:

         (a)  ...

         (b)  ...

         (c)  ...

         (d)  if the applicant has or has had  leave  as  a  Highly  Skilled
             Migrant, a Writer, composer or artist, a self-employed  lawyer
             or as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant  under  the  Rules  in  place
             before 19 July 2010, and has not been  granted  leave  in  any
             categories other than these under the  Rules  in  place  since
             19 July  2010,  the  applicant  must  have  75  points  under
             paragraphs 7 to 34 of Appendix A.  ..."

    The Respondent accepted that Mr Iloene had entered the  United  Kingdom
    on 7th September 2003 with entry clearance as a student which was valid
    until 31st October 2004 and that he had been granted limited leave  to
    remain valid until 29th April 2006.  The  further  periods  of  limited
    leave were granted on 5th June 2006, valid  until  30th  January  2007,
    24th January 2007 valid until 24th January 2008 and 5th February  2008
    until 5th February 2010.  It was further accepted that he  was  granted
    limited leave to remain on 23rd  March  2010  as  a  Tier  1  (General)
    Migrant which expired on 23rd March 2013.

      Under the Immigration Rules for Tier  1  (General)  applicants  must,
    amongst other things, score:-

         "75 points under Appendix A (attributes) and provide the  specified
         documents; and

         10 points under Appendix  B  (English  language)  and  provide  the
         specified documents; and

         10 points under Appendix C (maintenance (funds))  and  provide  the
         specified documents."

    The immigration decision set out that Mr Iloene  had  been  awarded  55
    points under Appendix A and 10 points under Appendices B and C.   Under
    Appendix A: attributes under the section  "previous  earnings"  he  was
    required to demonstrate 40 points but the Respondent awarded  him  15.
    He had claimed 40 points for previous  earnings  of  �43,529.06.   This
    figure represented the following payments, namely dividends from Double
    Focus Consulting Ltd totalling  �16,594.42.   However,  the  Respondent
    considered it implausible that the dividend payment was a  genuine  one
    on the basis that the company had only  generated  invoices  of  �6,277
    during the period from incorporation of the company on 14th August 2012
    until 31st December 2012.  It was further considered that the amount of
    �16,549.42 had been generated by recycling money  between  the  current
    account and the business account during  the  same  period.   Thus  the
    Respondent discounted those amounts as they could not be relied upon as
    genuine earnings.  The further figure included was a redundancy payment
    of �4,520.84 from Global Dawn Ltd in the earnings of  �43,529.06.   The
    Respondent did not accept that this  was  "unearned  income"  based  on
    paragraph 103 of the  Tier  1  guidance  which  stated  that  "unearned
    sources of income that  we  will  not  consider  as  previous  earnings
    include  ...  redundancy  payments".   Therefore  the  Respondent   had
    discounted the figure  of  �21,115.26  from  the  claimed  earnings  of
    �43,529.06.  It was accepted by  the  Respondent  that  his  salary  of
    �16,186.74 had been accepted as genuine.   Thus  the  total  amount  of
    earnings that had been accepted for the  purposes  of  the  application
    were �22,413.80 giving Mr Iloene a total of 15 points.  Thus he  could
    not demonstrate that he had 75 points  as  required  under  Appendix  A
    (attributes) and the application was refused under  paragraph  245CD(d)
    of the Immigration Rules.

 7. In the notice of immigration decision, section B dealt with  rights  of
    appeal  including the  One-Stop  Warning  -  Statement  of  Additional
    Grounds.  That set out as follows:-

         "One-Stop Warning - Statement of Additional Grounds

         You must now inform us of any reasons why you think you  should  be
         allowed to stay in this country.  This includes  why  you  wish  to
         stay here, and any  grounds  why  you  should  not  be  removed  or
         required to leave.

         You do not have to repeat any reasons you have already given us but
         if you do have any more reasons you must now disclose them.

         If you apply later to stay here for a reason which you  could  have
         given us now, you may not be able to appeal if the  application  is
         refused.

         If, at a later date, the  reasons  why  you  think  you  should  be
         allowed to stay in this country change, or new reasons  arise,  you
         must tell us as soon as possible.

         If you later apply to stay here for a reason which you  could  have
         raised earlier, you may not be able to appeal if the application is
         refused.

         This ongoing requirement  to  state  your  reasons  is  made  under
         Section 120 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

         Please note, if you choose to appeal  the  decision  under  Section
         82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002,  your
         previous leave and the terms of conditions attached to it, will  be
         extended by virtue  of  Section  3C  of  the  Immigration  Act  (as
         amended) until such a time as the appeal is resolved."

 8. Mr Iloene and his wife exercised their rights to appeal that  decision.
    The Grounds of Appeal submitted on Mr Ileone's behalf gave the  reasons
    why he sought to appeal  the  "non-asylum  decision"  relating  to  the
    Immigration  Rules.   In  the  Statement  of  Additional  Grounds   the
    following was stated:-

         "The decision will cause the UK to be in breach of her  obligations
         under Article 8 of the ECHR  as  the  Appellant  (Mr  Iloene)  has
         established a private life  in  the  UK  having  lived  in  the  UK
         lawfully throughout his stay here."

 9. Their appeal was heard on 31st October 2013 at Hatton Cross before  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Walker).  In a determination promulgated  on
    5th November 2013, Judge Walker dismissed Mr Iloene's appeal under  the
    Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds. As a consequence of  his
    decision, this appellant could not succeed as she  was  dependant  upon
    his application as the partner of a Tier 1  Migrant.  The  judge  heard
    oral evidence from Mr Iloene only( and not  his  wife  )  and  had  the
    advantage of considering a bundle of  documentation  including  witness
    statements filed on behalf of them both and documents relevant  to  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules.

10.  At paragraphs 21 to  28  the  judge  set  out  his  findings  of  fact
    concerning that application.  He found that the Mr Iloene had failed to
    show the earnings as claimed by him and was therefore not  entitled  to
    the 40 points claimed under Appendix A.  The judge,  having  considered
    the oral evidence in the light of the documents that  had  been  placed
    before him of these sums that had been claimed as earnings from  Double
    Focus Consulting were in fact  not  earnings  and  that  a  substantial
    amount of money had been  moved  from  other  accounts  as  well  as  a
    repayment of a loan that appeared  to  have  nothing  to  do  with  the
    business.  Thus he did not accept Mr Iloene's claim that  the  business
    had grossed the amount of  �18,672  as  claimed  either  as  a  limited
    company or the Appellant as a sole trader.  He found that he  had  been
    trying to pass off the movement of funds as earnings which was not  the
    case.

11. The judge also considered the claim to remain under Article  8  of  the
    ECHR at paragraphs 28 to 33.  He noted  that  in  respect  of  both  Mr
    Iloene and his wife, if returned to Nigeria, they  would  return  as  a
    family unit along with their daughter who at the date  of  the  hearing
    was 5 months of age, and also a  national  of  Nigeria.   Therefore  he
    found there to be no interference with their family life.  As to  their
    private lives, and in particular Mr Ileone who the judge noted had been
    studying and working in the United Kingdom for  ten  years,  the  judge
    found that whilst there would be an  interference  with  their  private
    lives he did not find it to be of such gravity as to engage Article  8.
    He stated:-

         "31. There has  been  no  detailed  evidence  as  to  exactly  what
             interference there would be to their private lives other  than
             the general claim being made.  The male Appellant has accepted
             in cross-examination that whilst he was studying it was always
             his intention to return  to  Nigeria  but  that  once  he  had
             started working in the United Kingdom he  wanted  to  stay  to
             take advantage of these work opportunities.  That may well  be
             the case but the Appellant is now well qualified after his  UK
             studies and has had good work experience.  This will no  doubt
             place him  in  good  stead  for  employment  on  a  return  to
             Nigeria."

    The judge then went to the issue of  proportionality  and  reached  the
    conclusion  that  having  taken   into   account   all   the   relevant
    circumstances the decisions of the Respondent were  proportionate.   It
    was further accepted that the neither Mr Ileone nor his wife could  not
    comply with the requirements of paragraph 276ADE  with  regard  to  any
    private life.  Thus the appeals were dismissed.

12. An application for permission to appeal the decision of the  First-tier
    Tribunal was made on behalf of both Appellants, as they then  were,  on
    13th November 2013.  The grounds are as follows:-

         "2.  With reference  to  paragraph  29  of  the  determination  and
             reasons, it is arguable whether the Immigration Judge may  not
             have misapplied or failed to apply the relevant  paragraph  of
             the Immigration Rules in respect of the First Appellant.

         3.   The IJ states at paragraph 29:

                  'I do accept that there will be  interference  with  their
                  private lives and more particularly the male Appellant  as
                  he has been studying and later working here in the UK  for
                  ten years.  Nevertheless  the  Appellants  are  unable  to
                  comply with the  requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE  with
                  regard to private life.'

         4.   In submissions on behalf of the Appellant at the hearing,  the
             IJ  had  been  respectfully  invited  to  take  note  of   the
             Appellant's statement at paragraph 34 of his witness statement
             to the effect of his ten years' lawful residence in the UK and
             the  acceptance  by  the   Respondent   of   the   Appellant's
             immigration history detailed at paragraph 2 of the  notice  of
             immigration decision.

         5.    The  IJ  had  then  properly   requested   the   Respondent's
             representative (HOPO) to comment on this (and Article 8).  The
             HOPO responded that the  Respondent  accepts  the  Appellant's
             immigration history and do not dispute the fact  that  he  had
             resided lawfully in the UK for ten years.  This exchange  will
             be in the Record of Proceedings.

         6.    It  was  submitted  that  the  Appellant  therefore  met  the
             requirements of paragraph 276B which provides for the grant of
             indefinite leave to remain in the UK on the basis of  his  ten
             years' lawful residence and includes the requirement  to  have
             passed the Life in the UK Test proof which the  Appellant  had
             submitted  to  the  Respondent  as  listed  at  paragraph   54
             appearing in the Respondent's bundle for the hearing.

         7.   It is submitted that the application to the male Appellant  by
             the Immigration Judge of paragraph 276ADE of  the  Immigration
             Rules which contains different requirements of that which  his
             case rests upon is wrong and justifies the grant of permission
             on this ground  on  the  basis  that  the  judge's  error  has
             vitiated his conclusions.

         8.   It is submitted  that  save  for  the  misapplication  of  the
             aforesaid paragraph of the Immigration Rules the IJ (supported
             by  the  acceptance  and  no  contest  put  forward   by   the
             Respondent)  would  have  allowed  the  appeal  of  the   male
             Appellant who clearly meets all the requirements at  paragraph
             276B of the Immigration Rules.

         9.   The Tribunal is invited to  grant  permission  to  appeal  the
             decision of the IJ as a different Tribunal properly  directing
             itself as the relevant Rule is likely  to  reach  a  different
             conclusion from that reached in this case."

13. On 29th November 2013 Upper Tribunal Judge Roberts  granted  permission
    for the following reasons:-

         "2.  The grounds seeking permission claim that the First  Appellant
             was entitled to be granted indefinite leave to remain  in  the
             United Kingdom on the basis of his ten years' lawful residence
             under paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules.  It is  claimed
             that the Respondent and the First-tier Tribunal Judge were put
             on notice of this at the hearing of the appeal on 31st October
             2013.  Ground 8 of the  grounds  seeking  permission  advances
             this argument and sets out that the judge should have  allowed
             the appeal of the First Appellant who clearly  meets  all  the
             requirements of paragraph 276B of the Rules.

         3.   The Record of Proceedings shows that  this  issue  was  raised
             with the judge.  However, the judge's determination  does  not
             address this point.

         4.   It is arguable that in failing  to  address  this  point,  the
             judge may have erred, not least because this is a matter which
             may  have  factored  into   the   Article   8   consideration.
             Permission to appeal is granted."

14. The Secretary of State issued a Rule 24 response on 13th December  2013
    on the following terms:-

         "The Respondent opposes the Appellant's  appeal.   In  summary  the
         Respondent will submit that the Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         directed himself appropriately.  It is submitted  that  the  First-
         tier Tribunal Judge did not err in law.  The appeal  was  based  on
         the application made by the  Appellant  under  the  PBS  Rules  and
         refused in relation to those Rules on this basis.  If the Appellant
         wished to make any other application to  be  considered  under  any
         other parts of the Immigration  Rules  he  will  need  to  make  an
         application and pay the fee.  It will be submitted that  the  judge
         has considered Appendix FM and stage 2 outside  the  Rules  on  the
         evidence before him.  The Respondent requests an oral hearing."

15. Thus the appeal came before the Upper  Tribunal  on  the  16th  January
    2014.  At that hearing there were two Appellants before  the  Tribunal,
    Mr Jude Emeka Iloene and his wife Anthonia Onyinye Iloene.   They  were
    represented by  Mr  M  Owolabi,  who  had  appeared  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Walker.  The Secretary of State was  represented  by  Mr
    Nath.  At the outset of the proceedings Mr Nath observed that there had
    been no attempt made to  either  ask  for  or  provide  the  Record  of
    Proceedings bearing in mind that the grounds for permission drafted  on
    behalf of the Appellants stated that the exchange between the judge and
    the Appellants relating to any application under paragraph  276B  would
    be in the Record of Proceedings (see Ground  5).   Mr  Nath  said  that
    there was no record from the Presenting Officer  on  file  and  he  had
    attempted to ask the Presenting Officer as to  the  events  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge but had not been able to do so.  He submitted
    that he would wish to see this before making any  further  submissions.
    I considered the case file and was able to provide to both parties  the
    note of Judge Walker which was in summary form but was typed.  The only
    reference was the very last entry on the page. There was no information
    as to what was actually said by either advocate.  There  is  no  record
    other than that as to the basis upon which  it  was  put,  how  it  was
    raised or in what context.  Consequently the advocates sought  time  to
    discuss matters between themselves and to consider the ROP, therefore I
    stood the case down.

16.   When the case  resumed  Mr  Nath  stated  that  both  representatives
    considered it was necessary for further material  to  be  obtained  and
    that both agreed that the matter should be adjourned.  It appeared that
    following their discussions it transpired that an application had  been
    made by Mr Iloene prior to the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  made  in
    September for leave to remain on long residence grounds under paragraph
    276B.  An acknowledgement of the application  was  dated  7th  November
    2013.  However it is plain from what the advocates told  me  that  this
    application which had been made by Mr Iloene prior to the FTT  hearing,
    the judge had not been referred  to  such  an  application.   In  those
    circumstances  both  parties  sought  time  for  material  to  be  made
    available including the application that had been made to the Secretary
    of  State  and  also  any  further  notes  concerning  the  Record   of
    Proceedings which had not been  possible  for  Mr  Nath  to  obtain  in
    advance of the hearing.  Furthermore,  there  was  no  evidence  placed
    before the Tribunal on behalf of the Appellants as to the events before
    the First-tier Tribunal  and  therefore  directions  were  made  for  a
    hearing.

17.   The directions were issued on 16th January 2014 directing any further
    response that the Secretary of State  wished  to  make  under  Rule  24
    should be filed and served no later than seven days before the  hearing
    and it was also ordered that the Respondent should  file  and  serve  a
    copy of the Presenting Officer's minute within 21 days  of  service  of
    the directions.  Further directions related to the parties serving upon
    the Tribunal any other documentary evidence upon which it  is  intended
    to rely.  The directions included one relating to both  parties  filing
    and serving skeleton arguments and the legal  authorities  relevant  to
    the issues and in particular those relating to Section 120 notices.

18.  Following  the  hearing,  a  letter  was  sent  from  the  Appellants'
    solicitors dated 24th April indicating that  the  first  Appellant,  Mr
    Iloene had been granted indefinite leave to remain and  requesting  for
    the hearing of the appeal, that was to be listed on 30th April 2014  to
    be vacated.  The issue was dealt with by Upper Tribunal Judge  O'Connor
    who responded to that request as follows:-

         "By Section 104(4A) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
         2002, the first Appellant's appeal is to be treated as abandoned as
         a consequence of him having been granted leave to  remain;  however
         the second Appellant, Mrs  Iloene,  still  has  an  appeal  pending
         before the Upper Tribunal.   There  has  been  no  application  for
         permission to withdraw her case.  In such circumstances the hearing
         of 30th April 2004 will proceed in order to determine  this  extant
         appeal."

19. Thus the appeal was listed before the Upper Tribunal on 30th April 2014
    and at this stage by reason of the decision  of  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    O'Connor in the light of the grant of indefinite leave to remain to  Mr
    Iloene, his appeal was treated as abandoned leaving only his wife as an
    Appellant before the Upper Tribunal.  I should observe  at  this  stage
    that despite the directions made following the adjourned hearing,  none
    of those directions had been complied  with  by  either  party  and  no
    further evidence was provided by either party, no Record of Proceedings
    or any further evidence relating to what had occurred before the First-
    tier Tribunal and no further evidence  of  any  kind  and  despite  the
    provision for skeleton arguments and the legal authorities relevant  to
    the issues, none of those were forthcoming.

20. At the  outset  of  the  hearing  Mr  Owolabi  made  reference  to  the
    correspondence to the Upper Tribunal of which  he  informed  the  court
    that Mr Iloene had been granted indefinite  leave  to  remain  and  had
    asked for the appeal to be vacated.  He appeared to be stating that the
    present Appellant Mrs Iloene  was  seeking  to  withdraw,  however,  it
    became apparent that there was no application to withdraw  her  appeal.
    He confirmed that there had been no further documentation  supplied  in
    accordance with the directions made.  The advocates asked for  time  to
    discuss the issues between themselves.

21. The hearing was then resumed. I heard  submissions  from  each  of  the
    advocates as this was an application to determine whether  or  not  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Walker) made an error of law in the decision
    relating to the only Appellant now, the Appellant's wife. The  relevant
    evidence being  that  which  had  been  placed  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

22.   Mr Owolabi submitted that there as an error of law disclosed  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal's decision in relation to the consideration of  the
    former first Appellant's appeal on the basis of paragraph 276B  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  He submitted that in the first Appellant's  witness
    statement the relevant paragraph being paragraph 5 (see page 33, 34  of
    the bundle) which was a joint statement that there was specific request
    to consider paragraph 276B and that the Appellant's husband had  stated
    that the period  of  residence  had  been  lawful.   It  was  therefore
    submitted that that was a Ground of  Appeal  and  was  brought  to  the
    attention of the Immigration Judge.  He  conceded  that  there  was  no
    evidence by way of solicitor's note or  witness  statement  from  those
    present but relying on the Record of Proceedings of the judge that  had
    been disclosed that at the bottom of the page where  it  stated  "276B"
    clearly related to that paragraph being raised.  This can be seen as  a
    specific  submission  in  view  of  the  Appellant's  request  in   his
    statement.  The Appellant's husband  had  already  accrued  ten  years'
    lawful residence before the hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    There is no reference in the determination to paragraph  276B.   Whilst
    the decision on private life  referred  to  paragraph  276ADE  and  his
    failure to accrue twenty years' residence, under paragraph 276B he  had
    accrued ten years' lawful  residence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision and therefore it should have been considered.

23. He further submitted that in the light of that error, it was  necessary
    to consider the only Appellant's position namely  his  wife.   She  had
    applied as a dependant of her husband and  thus  if  he  had  succeeded
    under paragraph 276B then she would  have  succeeded  on  human  rights
    grounds.  He dealt with the  position  of  Article  8  under  paragraph
    276ADE and therefore her  circumstances  meant  that  she  should  have
    succeeded under Article 8.  When asked  what  particular  circumstances
    were relevant, Mr Owolabi submitted that she  had  entered  the  United
    Kingdom lawfully to join her husband as  his  dependant  and  they  had
    lived together and secondly their child was born in the United  Kingdom
    on 15th June 2013.  However he  conceded  that  the  child  was  not  a
    British citizen and was not a child of a settled person.

24. I heard submissions from the Senior Presenting Officer Ms  Vidyadharan.
    She observed that it was important to remember that at this  stage  the
    Tribunal was at the error of law stage and in  those  circumstances  it
    was difficult to see how the judge made an error when  looking  at  the
    evidence that had been provided before him in respect of  the  evidence
    under the Immigration Rules and Article  8.   Paragraph  276B  was  not
    raised in the Grounds of Appeal that he had acquired ten years'  lawful
    residence and it could not be in the grounds because at that  stage  he
    had not accrued ten years' lawful residence.  There was no Section  120
    notice at any time and therefore it was difficult to see how the  judge
    had fell into error.  She submitted that he considered the case on  the
    basis upon which it was presented and the burden of proof  was  on  the
    Appellant who had had the ample opportunity given to  provide  evidence
    as to the events before the First-tier  Tribunal  which  has  not  been
    forthcoming and therefore they had not demonstrated  that  any  Section
    120 notice had been made.  Therefore the judge considered the issue  of
    length of residence by reference to  paragraph  276ADE  which  was  the
    correct Rule when considering Article 8.  She further submitted that Mr
    Owolabi was seeking to argue that  the  judge  should  have  considered
    paragraph 276B because he could potentially  meet  the  long  residence
    Rules and therefore it was a breach of Article 8.   However,  his  wife
    could not meet any Rule as  her  length  of  residence  was  only  from
    December 2012 and it is difficult to see on the facts of her particular
    case how she could succeed outside the Rules relating to Article 8.

25. Mr Owolabi submitted by way of reply that  potentially  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge could have allowed the appeal and should have considered
    the position of the second Appellant in the chronology of  events.   He
    confirmed that the Appellant Mrs Iloene  did  not  give  oral  evidence
    before the  First-tier  Tribunal  because  the  appeal  turned  on  the
    husband's case and not his wife's.

26. At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision which I now
    give.

Conclusions:

27.   There is only one Appellant before the Tribunal, Mrs Anthonia Onyinye
    Iloene and the stage of the proceedings that we have  reached  is  that
    the Upper Tribunal is required to determine whether the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Walker) discloses an error  of  law  in  his
    decision by reference to the evidence that was before him.

28.   It is necessary to set out  the  chronology  of  events.   Mr  Iloene
    entered the UK as a student on 7th September  2013.   His  leave  as  a
    student was extended and was later  extended  as  a  Tier  1  (General)
    Migrant expiring on  23rd  March  2013.   His  wife  joined  him  as  a
    dependant of  a  Tier  1  (General)  Migrant  in  December  2012.   The
    application that was made by Mr Iloene with his wife as a dependant was
    made when he had leave on 22nd March 2013 and this was  for  indefinite
    leave to remain under paragraph 245CD of the Immigration Rules  HC  395
    (as amended).  This was on the basis that he had lived  and  worked  in
    the United Kingdom continuously and lawfully for the last five years.

29.   At the date of that application, Mr Iloene had not accrued ten years'
    lawful residence and his wife had been in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
    period of four months only.

30.  The decision made by the Secretary of State was  made  on  18th  April
    2013 and I have set out the terms of that decision at  paragraph  5  of
    the determination.  At the date of the decision of  the  Respondent  Mr
    Iloene had not accrued ten years' lawful residence.

31.   Following the refusal of the decision, the Grounds of Appeal made  no
    reference to an application under paragraph 276B and in  the  statement
    of additional grounds there was also no reference to it.  That  is  not
    surprising because at the date when the Grounds of Appeal were filed Mr
    Iloene could not meet the criteria of ten years'  lawful  residence  by
    that date.

32.   The ten years' lawful residence was accrued in  September  2013.   It
    now appears from information that was provided to Mr  Nath  in  January
    2014 at the last court  hearing,  that  an  application  was  made  for
    indefinite leave to remain after  he  had  accrued  ten  years'  lawful
    residence which was before the hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    but that such an application does not appear to have  been  brought  to
    the attention of the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  indeed  it  was  not
    brought to the attention of the Upper Tribunal until 16th January 2014.
     It was that application which succeeded in February of this year which
    led to Mr Iloene's appeal being abandoned.

33. Turning to the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.  That took place
    on 31st October 2013 and it is clear from the  determination  that  the
    judge plainly had regard to the fact that Mr Iloene  had  been  in  the
    United Kingdom with lawful leave for a ten year period.  It is  further
    plain from the decision of the First-tier Tribunal that  the  case  was
    advanced substantially and primarily on the basis of  Mr  Iloene  (with
    his wife as a dependant) as a  Tier  1  Migrant  and  having  satisfied
    paragraph 245CD.  The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  considered
    that application in the light of the decision  of  the  Respondent  but
    reached the conclusion that Mr Iloene had  failed  to  demonstrate  the
    earnings as claimed by him and thus was not entitled to the  40  points
    claimed  under  Appendix  A  and  therefore  could  not   satisfy   the
    Immigration Rules under paragraph 245CD.

34.  He gave  further  consideration  to  the  Article  8  rights  of  both
    Appellants at [29-31].  He took into account  that  return  to  Nigeria
    would be as a  family  unit  along  with  their  daughter,  a  Nigerian
    citizen, who was 5 months of  age  and  therefore  there  would  be  no
    interference with their family life.  He did accept that there would be
    an interference with their private lives and gave express consideration
    to Mr Iloene's position noting that he had been studying and working in
    the United Kingdom for ten years, however, as the judge  observed,  the
    application had been considered  under  paragraph  276ADE  and  neither
    Appellant could meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules relating
    to Article 8.  Nonetheless, rather  than  considering  whether  or  not
    there were any compelling circumstances that  existed  outside  of  the
    Rules, the judge went on to consider freestanding Article 8 at [31] but
    found that there would not be an interference with the private life  to
    be of such gravity as to engage Article 8 noting that,

         "There  has  been  no  detailed  evidence  as   to   exactly   what
         interference there would be to their private lives other  than  the
         general claim being made.  The male Appellant has accepted in cross-
         examination that whilst he was studying it was always his intention
         to return to Nigeria but that once he had started working in the UK
         he wanted to stay to take  advantage  of  the  work  opportunities.
         That may well be the case but the Appellant is  now  well-qualified
         after his UK studies and has had good work experience.   This  will
         no doubt place him in good stead for  employment  on  a  return  to
         Nigeria."

    Notwithstanding that paragraph as to the gravity  of  the  interference
    the judge resolved, it appears, the Razgar questions in favour  of  the
    Appellants and considered the issue of  proportionality  at  [33].   He
    stated that having carried out a balancing  exercise  and  taking  into
    account  the  relevant  circumstances   that   the   decision   was   a
    proportionate one.  Thus he dismissed the appeals under the Immigration
    Rules and on human rights grounds.

35. The basis upon  which  it  is  stated  the  judge  made  an  error  was
    originally advanced on behalf of Mr Iloene.  Whilst he is no longer  an
    Appellant before the Tribunal it is still advanced by Mr  Owolabi  that
    there was an error of law in relation to the decision relating  to  his
    appeal.

36.  I observe that it is difficult to reach a firm conclusion as  to  what
    transpired at that hearing.  Despite issuing directions in January,  no
    further evidence has been filed as to the events before the  First-tier
    Tribunal by either party.  It was the case on behalf of  the  Appellant
    that the judge was specifically provided with submissions  relevant  to
    paragraph 276B and that such an exchange would  be  in  the  Record  of
    Proceedings and was confirmed by the Presenting Officer  at  the  time.
    There is no minute from the Presenting Officer and there is no  further
    evidence on behalf of the appellant by way of a  witness  statement  or
    otherwise in relation to those proceedings.  There is however a copy of
    the judge's Record of Proceedings which fortunately was typed.   It  is
    however in note form and the only reference to paragraph 276B is at the
    very last page in which it is said "276B of the  Rules.   He  has  been
    here with leave since 2003" and then at the  very  bottom  "276B".   Mr
    Owolabi submits that the case on behalf of the Appellant  was  advanced
    on the basis that he met the requirements  of  paragraph  276B  at  the
    hearing before the judge and relies upon the witness  statement  of  Mr
    Iloene.  I have been referred to paragraphs 34 and 35  of  the  witness
    statement dated 31st October 2013.  It states as follows:-

         "33. I further ask the court to consider my case under the right to
             family life and private life consideration in the  Immigration
             Rules.

         34.  As I stated previously, I have lived in the UK for a period of
             over ten years now and as acknowledged in the  refusal  notice
             of the Secretary of State, all my period of residence to  date
             has been lawful and is now a gross period of ten years and one
             month.

         35.  Further my wife is in the UK as my dependant  both  under  the
             Immigration Rules and in respect of this appeal.  We also have
             our daughter who was born in the UK and as I understand it she
             is not in the UK unlawfully.

         36.  I request the Immigration Judge to kindly  consider  our  case
             and allow our appeal against the decision of the SSHD."

37. There is no specific reference to paragraph 276B in that  statement  or
    any request for the judge to consider that as an issue  although  there
    is reference at [34] that he had lived in the UK for a period  of  over
    ten years and that it was lawful residence of ten years and  one  month
    when the statement was made, and in those circumstances may potentially
    be seen as a reference to paragraph 276B.  However if that were  right,
    it has still not been explained why there was no express  reference  to
    paragraph 276B in the witness statement nor why a  Section  120  notice
    had not been filed at the time when  ten  years  had  been  accrued  on
    behalf of the Appellant on a date either  before  the  hearing  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal or even at the outset of the hearing  before  Judge
    Walker.

38.   I can find no reference to any notice being provided at the beginning
    of the hearing or any preliminary issue being raised at the  outset  of
    the hearing  concerning  this  issue.   At  best,  the  only  available
    evidence is the Record of Proceedings, which  does  make  reference  to
    paragraph 276B at the very last part of  the  proceedings  but  as  the
    judge has not recorded anything further it is not clear  to  me  as  to
    whether or not it was accepted  by  the  judge  that  this  constituted
    notice or that there had been any formal application  made.   I  accept
    that the issue of paragraph 276B was raised at the  hearing  as  it  is
    plain from the Record of Proceedings in broad terms that that paragraph
    was referred to by reason of the reference to it, although it  has  not
    been explained further as to what submissions exactly were made and why
    they were not made at the outset of the hearing or for any Section  120
    notice to be filed.

39.   I have considered the law  relevant  to  this  issue  and  despite  a
    direction to both parties to provide skeleton arguments  to  deal  with
    this issue none have been forthcoming.  I have considered the  decision
    of Lamichhane v The SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 260 and that  a  statement  of
    "additional grounds" may be made in response to a Section 120 notice at
    any time, including up to (and perhaps at the time of) the  hearing  of
    the  appeal.   That  decision  also  makes  plain  that  although   the
    legislative scheme prescribes no particular form in which  a  statement
    of "additional grounds" must be  made,  such  a  statement  must  as  a
    minimum set out with some level of  particularity  the  grounds  relied
    upon by the Appellant as the foundation for remaining  in  the  UK  and
    upon which reliance has not previously been placed.   It  must  "state"
    the additional ground to be relied on in  substance  or,  at  least  in
    form.

40. The decision of the Supreme Court in Patel v The SSHD  [2013]  UKSC  72
    confirms that Section 85(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
    Act 2002 imposes a duty on the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  consider  any
    potential Ground of Appeal raised in response to a Section 120  notice,
    even if it is not directly related to  the  issues  considered  by  the
    Secretary of State in the original decision.  The  Supreme  Court  held
    that the grounds for an application for leave to remain can  be  varied
    up to the time when the decision is made.  If an application is  varied
    after the decision, then it would be open to the  applicant  to  submit
    further grounds to be considered at appeal.

41.   The Supreme Court agreed with the conclusion of the  majority  in  AS
    (Afghanistan) v The SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 106  that  an  appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal covers not only any ground before the Secretary  of
    State when she made the decision under  appeal  but  also  any  grounds
    raised in response to a one-stop notice issued under Section 120 of the
    2002 Act, even if they had not been the subject of any decision by  the
    Secretary of State and did not relate to the decision under appeal.  In
    AS (Afghanistan) the  Court  of  Appeal  had  said  that  the  decision
    appealed against which is referred to in the 2002 Act Section 85(2)  is
    the immigration decision taken under Section 82 but is not  a  decision
    characterised  by  reference  to   a   particular   Immigration   Rule.
    Accordingly it is appropriate in response to a  one-stop  notice  under
    Section 120 for an Appellant to state  any  provision  under  which  he
    sought leave to remain in the UK.  All such  grounds  would  then  come
    within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on  appeal,  including  any  on
    which the Secretary of State has not  already  made  a  decision.   The
    Secretary of State was not obliged to issue a one-stop  notice  but  if
    she did, Section 3C did not prevent the Appellant from raising all  the
    grounds for leave on which he sought to rely even if he had not  raised
    them  on  an  application  before.   There  was  no  reason   in   such
    circumstances why the Tribunal  should  not  be  the  primary  decision
    maker.

42.  However the issue is  whether  or  not  the  submission  made  at  the
    conclusion of the proceedings constituted a notice under  Section  120.
    As I have set out earlier, it has not been explained  why,  if  he  had
    accrued ten years' residence  before  the  hearing  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal why a Section 120 notice was not served either  prior  to  the
    hearing or at the very least at the outset  of  the  hearing  or  as  a
    preliminary issue in accordance with Lamichhane (as  previously  cited)
    where it is clear that there is no particular form in which a statement
    of additional grounds must be made, however, such statement, must as  a
    minimum set out with some level of particularity the grounds  which  he
    relies upon.  However I am prepared to accept given the reference to it
    that a submission  was  made  in  that  respect  when  taken  with  the
    statement of Mr Ileone which, although not  specifically  referring  to
    paragraph 276B, related in substance to the fact that  he  had  accrued
    ten years' residence prior to the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

43.   I now turn to the proceedings that are presently before the Tribunal.
     There is no appeal on behalf of Mr Iloene as by reason of Section  104
    of the 2002 Act his appeal  has  been  abandoned  having  been  granted
    indefinite leave to remain.  The question  before  me  is  whether,  in
    respect of the Appellant (Mr Iloene's wife) the judge made an error  of
    law that was material to the outcome of his wife's appeal.  As  I  have
    stated I am prepared to accept that potentially there was  an  argument
    raised that Mr Iloene had accrued ten years' lawful residence  and  was
    therefore entitled to succeed under paragraph 276B.   However  even  if
    the judge had recognised that Mr Iloene should have been granted  leave
    on the basis of his ten year residence that does not  necessarily  mean
    that his wife's position who is the current Appellant, that this  would
    make her Article 8 appeal any stronger.  Mrs  Iloene  had  entered  the
    United Kingdom as a dependant on 15th December 2012 and  therefore  had
    been in the United Kingdom for less than a year  at  the  time  of  the
    hearing  before  the   First-tier   Tribunal.    Even   accepting   the
    relationship between Mr Iloene and his wife, and on the basis that  the
    judge should have reached conclusions that he had  accrued  ten  years'
    lawful residence and he could potentially satisfy paragraph 276B,  this
    did not carry with it any  conclusion  that  the  wife's  appeal  would
    succeed simply on the basis that he would be eligible for  a  grant  of
    indefinite leave to remain.  She could not herself satisfy any relevant
    Immigration Rule.  Such a potential grant of leave does not preclude Mr
    Iloene from returning to Nigeria if he chose  to,  to  preserve  family
    life with his wife as he remains a Nigerian citizen with no  Article  8
    claim that requires him to stay in the United Kingdom.   The  grant  of
    indefinite leave to remain is therefore of no material relevance to the
    wife's appeal and does not carry any  presumption  that  she  would  be
    granted indefinite leave to remain and  therefore  her  position  as  a
    Nigerian citizen has not changed.

44.   As the First-tier Tribunal Judge observed when dealing with Article 8
    issues, there  was  little  evidence  advanced  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal concerning Article  8  issues.   It  consisted  of  a  witness
    statement from the husband which was co-signed by the present Appellant
    as a dependant referring to her presence in the United Kingdom and that
    they had a child that was born in the United Kingdom,  although  it  is
    common ground between the parties that  the  child  is  not  a  British
    citizen.  The Appellant, Mrs Iloene, did not give oral evidence  before
    the First-tier Tribunal and it is plain from the findings  recorded  by
    the judge that that is consistent with the lack of evidence advanced on
    Article 8 grounds.  There was no evidence from which it could  properly
    be said that he parties could not resume their  family  life  in  their
    home country, which was the finding made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    judge.

45. I have therefore considered what evidence there was  to  say  that  the
    parties should enjoy family life in the  UK  rather  than  in  Nigeria?
    Considering the Appellant's position  according  to  the  history,  she
    married a Nigerian citizen and had remained living  in  Nigeria  during
    the time that he had established his business in  the  United  Kingdom.
    It is not said that she has any right to remain in the  United  Kingdom
    and her length of residence has been short and there is little  by  way
    of further evidence in support of any private and family life.  If  the
    position is considered jointly with her husband,  the  position  in  my
    judgment is no different.  Both Mr and Mrs Iloene  remain  citizens  of
    Nigeria and whilst Mr Iloene may have been granted indefinite leave  to
    remain there is no evidence demonstrated as to why family  life  cannot
    be enjoyed in their country  of  nationality  rather  than  the  United
    Kingdom.  It is plain that she could not  meet  the  Immigration  Rules
    relating  to  Article  8  to  demonstrate  family  life  and  in  those
    circumstances, any error of law made by the judge in not  dealing  with
    the issue of paragraph 276B  in  relation  to  her  husband,  does  not
    materially affect the decision relating to the Appellant's wife on  any
    Article 8 grounds.

46. For those reasons I have reached the conclusion that the Appellant  has
    not demonstrated any error of law which should  lead  to  the  decision
    being set aside.  Thus I conclude that even if the judge were in  error
    in respect of Mr Iloene such error was not  capable  of  affecting  the
    outcome of the appeal, therefore it has not been demonstrated that  the
    determination should be set aside.

Decision

47. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal therefore should stand.
