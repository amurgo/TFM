For the Appellant:     Mr J Rene of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant, born on 10th August 1987, is a citizen  of  the  Gambia.
    The Appellant had made application for leave to remain as a partner and
    that application had been refused by the Respondent on 3rd May 2017.

 2. The Appellant has appealed that decision and her appeal  was  heard  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Mace sitting at Hatton Cross  on  28th
    September 2017.  The judge had dismissed her appeal.   Application  for
    permission to appeal had been granted and the matter had come before me
    in the Upper Tribunal on 10th May 2018 firstly to decide if an error of
    law had been made by the First-tier Tribunal.  It was conceded  by  the
    Respondent at that hearing that a material error of law had  been  made
    and I issued directions that the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    should be set aside and a fresh decision made.

 3. The matter came before me in accordance with  that  notice  of  resumed
    hearing.  I was presented with an Appellant's bundle  containing  those
    documents listed at folios 2 to 183 on the index sheet  to  the  bundle
    and a skeleton argument together with documentation from  the  original
    hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.

 4. Mr Walker at the outset of the hearing conceded that the Appellant  met
    the required threshold income of ï¿½18,600 in accordance with Appendix FM
    of the Immigration Rules and conceded therefore that her appeal  should
    be allowed.  That was a decision with which I agreed.

Notice of Decision

 5. I allow this appeal under the Immigration Rules.

    No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  fee  award
of any fee which has been paid or may be payable
