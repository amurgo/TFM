Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr.A.Eaton,of Counsel, instructed by Shaddai &
Company
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Algeria seeking  to  appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision dated 16th June  2016  to  deport  him  from  the
    jurisdiction.

2.   On 17th January 2015 the appellant committed offences involving  drugs,
    possession of money pertaining to the proceeds of crime and  possession
    of offensive weapon.  On 4th June 2015 he was convicted for  possessing
    a controlled drug with intent to supply and  for  using  or  possessing
    criminal property.  He was sentenced to four  months'  imprisonment  in
    relation to one offence and eight months' imprisonment  in  respect  of
    another, to be  served  consecutively,  making  a  sentence  of  twelve
    months' imprisonment.

3.   The appellant's appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Davey  for
    hearing on 20th March 2017.  The asylum  claim  was  dismissed  on  its
    merits.  In terms of the claims for human rights the Judge  noted  that
    the appellant was a foreign criminal  and  proceeded  to  evaluate  the
    matter in the  light  of  the  undoubted  interest  of  the  public  in
    deportation, having regards to  paragraphs  396,  398,  399  and  399A,
    together with Section 117C of the 2002 Act.  The claim for human rights
    was dismissed.

4.   The appellant sought to appeal against that decision on the basis  that
    the Judge had fallen into error in considering  him  to  be  a  foreign
    criminal on the basis of his consecutive sentence.  Reliance was placed
    upon Olo & Ors (para 398 - "foreign criminal") [2016] UKUT 0056  (IAC).
    In that case it was held that consecutive  sentences  totalling  twelve
    months  did  not  make  an  appellant  a  foreign  criminal  under  the
    Immigration Rules or for the purposes of Section 117C.

5.   Thus the matter came before me to determine  the  issue  on  10th  July
    2017.  It was conceded most fairly by  Mr  Duffy  that  the  Judge  was
    indeed in error in taking that approach, but I  was  invited   to  find
    that the error was not in the event a material one as the appellant was
    undoubtedly a foreign criminal within  the  terms  of  117D(2)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  He had been convicted of
    an offence that had caused serious harm.

6.   I adjourned the matter for both parties  to  advance  their  respective
    arguments on that issue.  I am grateful to both for their submissions.

7.   Mr Duffy draws my attention to  the  terms  of  Section  117D(2)  which
    defines a foreign criminal as a person -

     (a) who is not a British citizen,

     (b) who has been convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence, and

     (c) who-

         (i)  has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least  12
             months,


         (ii) has been convicted of an offence that has caused serious harm,
             or


         (iii)    is a persistent offender.


8.   Mr Duffy indicates that it was always the intention  of  the  Secretary
    of State to treat the appellant as a foreign criminal on the  basis  he
    had been convicted of an offence which has  caused  serious  harm.   In
    that connection my attention was drawn to the  decision  of  16th  June
    2016  and  particularly  to  the  passage  dealing  with  reasons   for
    deportation which are as follows:-

     "On  18  May  2015,  at  North  London  Magistrates'  Court,  you  were
         convicted of one count of  possessing  an  offensive  weapon  in  a
         public place.  On 4 June 2015, at Blackfriars Crown Court, you were
         convicted of one count of possessing a controlled drug of  Class  B
         (Cannabis) with intent to supply, and one count of acquiring, using
         or possessing criminal property.  On 7 August 2015, at  Blackfriars
         Crown Court, you were sentenced to four  months'  imprisonment  for
         the conviction you received  on  18  May  2015  and  eight  months'
         imprisonment (comprised of concurrent sentences of  one  month  and
         eight months) for the conviction you received on 4 June 2015.  Both
         sentences were ordered to be consecutively, thereby making a  total
         sentence of 12 months' imprisonment."

9.   The decision goes on in a later paragraph:-

     "Your deportation is conducive to the public good  and  in  the  public
         interest because you have been convicted of an  offence  which  has
         caused serious harm.  This is because on  18  May  2015,  at  North
         London Magistrates' Court, you  were  convicted  of  one  count  of
         possessing an offensive weapon in a public place,  and  on  4  June
         2015, at Blackfriars Crown Court, you were convicted of  one  count
         of possessing a controlled drug of Class B (cannabis)  with  intent
         to supply, and one count of acquiring, using or possessing criminal
         property.  Therefore, in  accordance  with  paragraph  398  of  the
         Immigration Rules, the public interest  requires  your  deportation
         unless an exception to deportation applies.  The exceptions are set
         out at paragraphs 399 and 399A of the Immigration Rules."

10.  Thus Mr Duffy submits that the appellant is rightly to be treated as  a
    foreign criminal, accordingly  there  was  no  material  error  in  the
    approach taken by First-tier Tribunal Judge Davey.

11.  Mr Eaton, in his submissions, contends that the view of  the  Secretary
    of State as to seriousness should not be treated  by  the  Tribunal  as
    determinative, but that there should be an evaluation  of  whether  the
    offence is, in itself, one that should be  so  described.   He  submits
    that a blanket  approach  with  regard  to  all  offences  is  not  the
    appropriate way to approach this matter.  This is an offence  involving
    class B drugs rather than class A.  He submits that  it  cannot  safely
    simply be said that the offence without more meets that stringent  test
    and that a Judge, properly considering the matter, may have come  to  a
    different conclusion.  If the appellant is not  to  be  regarded  as  a
    foreign criminal then other considerations fall to be applied  relating
    more to  his  human  rights  than  to  the  statutory  framework  which
    otherwise would be in place.  He invites me to  overturn  the  decision
    and send the matter back to the First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  Judge  to
    determine the issue of whether or not the appellant is indeed a foreign
    criminal.  In the course of his submissions  Mr  Eaton  relied  upon  a
    number of authorities.

12.  It is to be noted that there is no definition of what  causing  serious
    harm means in the context of the Immigration Rules,  or  indeed  within
    Section 117.

13.  Some guidance has been provided by the  Home  Office  in  their  policy
    "Criminality: Article 8 ECHR cases" published on 22nd February 2017.

14.  That sets out the definition of serious harm as follows:-

     "It is at  the  discretion  of  the  Secretary  of  State  whether  she
         considers an offence to have caused serious harm.

     An offence that has caused 'serious harm' means  an  offence  that  has
         caused serious physical  or  psychological  harm  to  a  victim  or
         victims, or that has  contributed  to  a  widespread  problem  that
         causes serious harm to a community or to society in general.

     The foreign criminal does not have to have been convicted  in  relation
         to any serious harm which followed from their offence. For example,
         they may fit within this provision  if  they  are  convicted  of  a
         lesser offence because it cannot be proved beyond reasonable  doubt
         that they were guilty of a separate  offence  in  relation  to  the
         serious harm which resulted from their actions.

     Where a person has been convicted of one or more violent, drugs or  sex
         offences, they will usually be considered to have been convicted of
         an offence that has caused serious harm."

15.  The nature of the appellant's offence  is  helpfully  set  out  in  the
    course of the sentencing remarks by the Judge on 7th August 2015 to  be
    found at pages 148 onwards in the Tribunal bundle.  It is to  be  noted
    that the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed  was  reduced
    because of a guilty plea.

16.  The appellant was in the street with  some  twenty  wraps  of  cannabis
    (27.2 gms) in his possession.  He was in the course of selling one wrap
    to a purchaser in  the  street.   He  had  two  mobile  phones  in  his
    possession, a bladed lock knife with a five  inch  blade  and  ï¿½600  in
    cash.  His explanation for the knife was that it was for  his  defence.
    It was the view of the Judge that this was plainly street  dealing  and
    as such a commercial activity to be regarded within category 3  of  the
    guidelines.  It was found that the appellant was  playing  a  mid-role,
    which was a significant role, because he  was  motivated  by  financial
    gain and had an operational function within the chain in terms of final
    sale to an end user.  The ï¿½600 was obviously a float and receipts  from
    previous deals of what would seem to have been a  tolerably  profitable
    activity.  No other source of income had been suggested to explain  his
    survival without proper lawful employment.
17.  The Judge considered whether  the  sentence  should  be  suspended  but
    noted that  drug dealing was a serious matter, such that a sentence  of
    imprisonment was inevitable.  That which was to be imposed was  reduced
    because of his guilty plea.  As to the knife, the Judge took a  serious
    view of that, rejecting the submissions  that  it  was  in  his  pocket
    accidentally and imposed a custodial sentence in respect of that.

18.  My attention has been drawn to the  decision  of  LT  (Kosovo)  and  DC
    (Jamaica) [2016] EWCA Civ 1246 as promulgated by the Court of Appeal on
    28th June 2016.

19.  The two appeals raised a common question, namely "Should an offence  of
    supplying a class A drug fall to be treated as causing  'serious  harm'
    within the meaning  of  paragraph  398(c)  of  the  Immigration  Rules,
    regardless of the particular circumstances of offending?".

20.  In the case of LT he was convicted of supplying cocaine  by  way  of  a
    single deal to a friend in a  small  quantity.   He  was  sentenced  to
    fifteen months' imprisonment which  was  subsequently  reduced  to  ten
    months.

21.  DC was convicted of a single supply of a class A drug and sentenced  to
    42 weeks' imprisonment.

22.  The primary  argument  addressed  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  was  that
    paragraph 398(c) of the Rules requires the decision maker to arrive  at
    a judgment informed by the particular facts of the case.  It should not
    be assumed that every single incidence of supplying class A drugs as  a
    matter of fact causes serious harm.

23.  The Court of Appeal noted that serious harm is not one that is  defined
    in the Rules but noted the policy.

24.  It was the argument advanced on behalf of the Secretary of  State  that
    substantial weight should be accorded by the Tribunals to her  view  as
    to what offences cause  serious  harm.   Attention  was  drawn  to  the
    court's recognition  in  N  (Kenya)  [2004]  EWCA  Civ  1094  that  the
    Secretary of State is best placed to consider  whether  deportation  is
    conducive to the public good.  The Court considered that the  Secretary
    of State was entitled to regard class A drug  trafficking  offences  as
    very serious and ones which are particularly  serious  and  harmful  to
    society.  Clearly Tribunals are not bound  by  that  opinion,  but  are
    required to treat the view of the Secretary of State  as  an  important
    relevant factor.  Comment was made in paragraph 21 of the judgment that
    this approach would also be applied in relation to Section 117C  and  D
    of the 2002 Act.

25.  The comment was made in paragraph 24 of the judgment as follows:-


         "As to that, I can well see that the  proposition  that  all  drugs
         offences are by their nature serious may be questionable, but  what
         matters here is  the  Secretary  of  State's  undoubted  view  that
         supplying Class A drugs causes serious harm.  In my judgment,  that
         is a perfectly reasonable view, though Mr Sedon would not  have  it
         so.  He submitted today that the Secretary of State would  have  to
         provide narrative reasons for taking such  a  view;  reasons  which
         would demonstrate a particular expertise.  I do not agree.  It is a
         matter of social and moral judgement.  The Secretary of State  with
         her constitutional responsibilities is entitled to take the overall
         view she did and express it as she has.  She was entitled  to  take
         that view in both of these cases.  Her doing so was  not  repugnant
         to her extant policy."

26.  In the event the Court of Appeal upheld the Tribunal decision  in  both
    cases and dismissed the appeals of LT and DC.

27.  As Mr Eaton submits, this of course is a case involving class B  drugs.
    However this is not simply a supply of drugs to a friend  but  was,  in
    the findings of the sentencing judge, a commercial enterprise for  gain
    supplying a considerable amount of drugs and no doubt  having  supplied
    others for gain previously.  The amount of money was reflective of  the
    degree of trade.  The presence of a knife was also  a  serious  matter.
    It is difficult to conceive of commercial dealings of drugs of whatever
    category in the street as not contributing to drug use and  drug  abuse
    in the community.  Insofar as the knife was concerned, it has  been  an
    increasing problem of knife crime in UK cities, such that the tariff of
    sentencing has increased in order  to  deter  and  to  punish.   It  is
    difficult, when considering the definition of serious harm set  out  in
    the policy, to conclude otherwise than it applies, particularly in  the
    circumstances of the applicant.  As was made  clear  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in LT that considerable weight should be afforded to the view of
    the Secretary of State  who  is  charged  with  maintaining  order  and
    control.

28.  Mr Eaton also relies upon a decision of Upper Tribunal Judge  Finch  of
    3rd July 2017 in the matter of Wondeyohannes (JR/9392/2016).  It  seems
    to me that in that decision the Judge says little more than  was  dealt
    with by  the  Court  of  Appeal,  simply  stressing  that  it  was  not
    sufficient for the respondent simply to  rely  on  a  criminal  Judge's
    sentencing remarks.  There is no indication  that  that  was  the  case
    here.

29.  The final case was that of Chege [2016] UKUT 187  (IAC).   That  was  a
    decision as to whether an appellant constituted a  persistent  offender
    with the significance of a "spent" offence.  For my part I find  it  of
    little assistance in the current circumstance.  There  is  possibly  an
    argument to be advanced  that  the  appellant  was  also  a  persistent
    offender, but that is not what is relied upon in the  circumstances  of
    this appeal.

30.  Clearly the class of drug is a relevant  consideration  in  considering
    the serious nature of the offence and the harm which it  causes.   That
    must of course be dependent upon the  nature  of  the  dealing  of  the
    commercial exploitation.   As  I  have  indicated,  it  is  not  simply
    somebody supplying a wrap of drug to a friend, but is part  of  a  much
    wider commercial organisation.

31.  The issue in this appeal is a simple one - whether  or  not  the  Judge
    would have upheld the contention made by the Secretary  of  State  that
    the offence was one causing serious harm, in which case  the  appellant
    would remain a foreign criminal.   I have no doubt, that had the  Judge
    applied the correct principles to the consideration of the offence,  he
    would have upheld the Secretary of State in her view.   In  that  event
    the appellant would have remained classed as a "foreign  criminal"  for
    the purposes of the further human rights analysis.   It  has  not  been
    suggested that the analysis itself is flawed on such a basis.

32.  In those circumstances I do not find that the error of law is  material
    to the outcome of the decision.

33.  In the alternative,  had  there  been  any  doubt  as  to  the  Judge's
    approach, the decision would have been set aside for me to remake and I
    would have held that indeed the appellant was a  foreign  criminal  and
    applied the principles accordingly.


Notice of Decision

34.  In  all  the  circumstances  therefore  the  appeal  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal is dismissed.  The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  shall
    stand, namely  that  the  appellant's  appeal  in  respect  of  asylum,
    deportation and human rights stand to be dismissed.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
