For the Appellant:     Dr A I Corban, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Ms E Martin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

Details of appellant and basis of claim

   1.       This appeal comes before me following the grant of permission on
      2 May 2013 by Designated Tribunal Judge  Garratt  in  respect  of  the
      determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge W L  Grant  dismissing  the
      appeal of the appellant following a hearing  at  Taylor  House  on  11
      March 2013. The matter came before him on a float list and as a result
      the respondent was not represented.
   2.       The appellant is a Nigerian national. Two dates  of  birth  have
      been put forward - 12 and 18 February 1969;  the  appellant  maintains
      the latter is correct. He claims to have entered  the  UK  from  Italy
      with a visa but various years for entry in the 1990s have  been  given
      and there is no record of  lawful  entry.  He  has  also  contradicted
      himself by claiming that it was a visitor's visa but elsewhere that it
      was a "sports" visa (in his letter/statement of 6 February  2013).  He
      claims his passport had gone missing and obtained a new one  in  2004.
      On 7 April 2004 he submitted an application for a  residence  card  on
      the basis of his marriage to an  EEA  national.  The  application  was
      refused and it transpired that this was a sham marriage for which  the
      appellant paid �3500 (although he claims he was tricked and  pressured
      into it). On 3 February 2012 (received on 7 February),  the  appellant
      made an application to remain outside the  Immigration  Rules  on  the
      basis of his relationship with Fatou Jagne, and her two  children.  On
      19 April the Secretary of State returned the sponsor's passport to the
      representatives but maintained  that  the  other  documents  would  be
      retained until a final decision was made.  In  a  notice  of  decision
      dated 30 April 2012, the respondent applied paragraphs 322(1) and  322
      (1)(a) on the basis that he had sought leave for a purpose not covered
      by the rules, that he had no valid leave when the application had been
      made ad that his passport had been confirmed to be  a  forgery.  In  a
      letter dated 20 April 2012 she refused the Article 8 claim.

   3.       The appellant's solicitors made enquiries about the progress  of
      the application on 28 November 2012 and on 11 December  were  informed
      that a decision had been made on 19 April 2012. A copy of the decision
      notice was enclosed (that is dated 30 April) and the appellant  lodged
      an  appeal  on  14  December.  It  was  maintained  that   the   first
      notification the appellant and his representatives had received of the
      refusal was the notice sent with the letter of 11 December.

   4.       No issue appears to have  been  taken  at  any  stage  with  the
      timeliness of the appeal. It came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  W
      Grant but as mentioned above, it was in a float list and so there  was
      no presenting officer. It was dismissed following the hearing  by  way
      of a determination dated 20 March 2013.

   5.       The grounds argue that the decision was made on 11 December 2012
      (the date the appellant maintains he was first served with the  notice
      of decision) and the judge erred in considering the appeal  under  the
      old Immigration Rules. It is also  argued that the judge erred in  his
      findings under paragraph 322(1) and 322(IA), that he erred in findings
      the appellant's passport was forged when that had never been raised by
      the respondent as an issue and that he made  irrational  and  perverse
      findings in respect of the appellant's credibility. Lastly,  criticism
      is made of the Article 8 findings which are said to  be  contradictory
      and unclear. It is  argued  that  the  judge  did  not  undertake  any
      balancing exercise when assessing proportionality.
   6.       The respondent has filed a  Rule  24  response  questioning  the
      jurisdiction of the Tribunal to hear the appeal given that  Notice  of
      Appeal was lodged in December 2012 and the decision was made in April.



 Appeal hearings

   7.       The appeal first came before me on 20 June 2013. I  first  heard
      submissions on the  preliminary  issue  of  jurisdiction.  It  was  Ms
      Martin's submission that the decision of 30 April 2012 had been served
      on the appellant and that his appeal of December 2012 was out of time.
      Dr Corban's submission was that there was no evidence of  service  and
      that as the notice was first served in December 2012  that  should  be
      assumed to be the date of the decision. The relevance of this was that
      had the date of decision been in December,  the  amended  rules  would
      have become applicable and the appellant should  not  be  deprived  of
      full consideration of his case under  all  the  applicable  rules.  Ms
      Martin countered that submission with the argument that  even  if  the
      decision had not been served in  April,  the  appellant's  application
      still  fell  to  be  decided  under  the  old  rules   following   the
      implementation section of HC 194 which clearly stated that all  pre  9
      July 2012 applications were to be decided on that basis.  Nevertheless
      she stated that her enquiries had  shown  that  the  notice  had  been
      served on the appellant's solicitors in  April  by  recorded  delivery
      however as the file was in transit to her she could  not  provide  the
      recorded delivery number. In the  circumstances  I  proposed  to  hear
      submissions on all matters and then to adjourn part heard to the  next
      available  date  prior  to  which  any  evidence  available  from  the
      Secretary of  State  regarding  service  should  be  served  upon  the
      parties. Ms Martin did not raise any objections to the hearing of  the
      appeal given that the Notice of Appeal did raise the issue of lateness
      if it were not accepted that the December service date  was  also  the
      date of the decision. She maintained however that the date of decision
      should be regarded as 30 April 2012 regardless of the date of service.

   8.       With respect to the substantive  grounds,  Dr  Corban  submitted
      that the judge was required to consider the law as  it  stood  at  the
      date of the hearing as well as  the  existing  circumstances.  He  was
      unable however to refer me to anything in the Acts or Procedure  Rules
      to  support  the  first  part  of  his  argument.  When  asked  how  a
      consideration of the new rules would benefit the appellant, Dr  Corban
      submitted that family life would have had to have been considered as a
      free standing issue. He criticised the judge for not  having  analysed
      family and private life, for making  contradictory  findings  and  for
      failing to consider whether it  would  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
      appellant's partner and  her  children  to  relocate  to  Nigeria.  He
      submitted there was a plethora of documents to show  cohabitation  and
      the appellant's partner's claim for single occupancy discount  of  her
      council tax did not mean the appellant was not  living  with  her.  Dr
      Corban submitted that the  judge  had  failed  to  consider  that  the
      authorities issuing the appellant's second passport had made an  error
      in the date and had wrongly reached his conclusions only on the  basis
      of that single error. He submitted there  had  been  no  intention  to
      deceive and nothing could have  been  achieved  by  a  change  in  the
      appellant's date of birth. His name  was  changed  simply  because  he
      preferred the other variation.

   9.       Ms Martin replied. She submitted that the judge had  not  simply
      considered the appellant's name and date of birth. The  passport  also
      contained a spelling error with regard  to  the  place  of  birth  and
      further, it was a completely different place of birth. There was  also
      a difference in how the appellant had signed his name.  The  Secretary
      of State had raised the issue of forgery in her letter and  the  judge
      did not err in making findings to that effect.  If the Tribunal agreed
      that the findings and conclusions under paragraph 322(1) and (1A) were
      sustainable, then that was the end of the matter.

  10.       With regard to the argument about the new rules, the  judge  was
      correct to find that he did not have to consider them as the  decision
      was dated April 2012. However if the December 2012  service  date  was
      taken as the date of the decision, then the transitional rules applied
      and they confirmed that any application made prior to 9 July 2012  (as
      the appellant's was) would be decided under the old rules. She  argued
      that even if the new rules applied, the appellant  could  not  benefit
      and so the judge's  failure  to  consider  them  was  immaterial.  The
      requirements of paragraph 276ADE(vi) could not be met as the appellant
      retained ties to Nigeria and had family  there.  He  would  also  fail
      under the financial requirements as he could  not  show  that  he  had
      �18,600 available to him, he did not have leave  to  remain  when  his
      application was made and the judge found he was not  living  with  his
      partner. There were also issues with  regard  to  his  suitability  to
      remain given the adverse credibility findings. The appellant had taken
      part in a sham marriage, it was not accepted he had been tricked  into
      it because he had paid �3500 to marry the woman. There was no evidence
      that he had given evidence for the prosecution at a trial  to  convict
      the organisers of the marriage and if he  had  been  told  his  status
      would be regularised in return, it was not credible that he would have
      done nothing to follow up that undertaking. Numerous reasons had  been
      given for rejecting the claim. Clear reasons had been provided.

  11.       Dr Corban responded. He submitted that the  background  evidence
      showed chaos in Nigeria and he argued this  supported  the  contention
      that the passport issuing authorities had  been  responsible  for  the
      wrong date of birth being entered for the appellant. He referred me to
      irregularities in political matters but submitted  that  impunity  was
      widespread in all levels of the government. He submitted that  it  was
      not for this Tribunal to consider details of the new rules with a view
      to assessing whether the appellant met the requirements. The  Tribunal
      was only required to make a decision as to whether the judge  made  an
      error of law in failing to consider them. He submitted  further,  that
      the appellant would fall to  be  considered  as  an  overstayer  under
      Appendix FM EX-1B. For that category he did not need to  show  �18,600
      or existing leave.   The judge did not  make  clear  findings  on  the
      relationship; had it been accepted  as  genuine  and  subsisting?  The
      issue of relocation should also have been considered.  It  was  highly
      unlikely that the appellant's partner would find work in  Nigeria  and
      the education of  the  children  would  be  disrupted.  The  appellant
      accepted he had entered into a sham marriage but that was a dark  part
      of his past and did not mean he did not have  a  genuine  relationship
      with his current partner. The core of his claim could be accepted even
      if there were inconsistencies and concerns over other matters.

  12.       That completed the submissions. A date for  8  August  was  then
      arranged, that being the earliest date available.

  13.       On 26 June Ms Martin served copies of a computer print out  said
      to  show  that  the  appellant's  solicitors  were  served  with   the
      appellant's  immigration  decision  on  19  April  2012  by   recorded
      delivery.  On  29  June,  the  appellant's  representatives  filed   a
      response.

  14.       When the matter resumed on 8 August  I  heard  submissions  from
      both sides. Ms Martin  had  not  had  sight  of  the  representatives'
      response and a copy was made available to her.  Dr  Corban  relied  on
      his response but  added  that  the  print  out  confirmed  that  three
      passports were sent by recorded delivery on 19 April but that  a  note
      below  that  indicated  that  the  files  was  sent  to  the  relevant
      department to liaise with the LIT (Local Immigration Team) with regard
      to service. He submitted this clearly demonstrated that  the  decision
      letter had not been sent out on 19 April. The entries related  to  two
      separate actions.

  15.       Ms Martin responded. She submitted that if the written  response
      was to be accepted then that would mean the  three  British  passports
      sent to the representatives had never been received. As there had been
      no suggestion that this was the case, it could been presumed that  the
      passport  and  refusal  letter  must  have  been  received.   In   the
      alternative, she relied on the submissions made at the  last  hearing.
      She pointed out that the issue over when the notice  of  decision  had
      been served went to the timeliness of the appeal but as the appeal had
      now been heard, that was academic.

  16.       Dr Corban replied. He submitted that it had  not  been  disputed
      that the passports had been returned. His argument was that there  was
      no trace of the recorded delivery package on the Royal  Mail  website.
      In any event, no decision was received. He submitted  that  the  judge
      should have considered both the old and the new rules. If he had  been
      right to apply the old rules, then  he  should  also  have  considered
      whether discretionary leave should have been given to the appellant as
      the appellant had asked for such leave when his application was  made.
      He conceded that the skeleton argument before the judge did not  refer
      to this but said that he had represented the appellant and he was sure
      he had made submissions on it. He argued this was not a new  point  as
      it was encompassed by the Article  8  assessment.  He  was  unable  to
      produce a copy of the policy and  accepted  it  had  not  been  placed
      before the judge.

  17.       Ms Martin argued that discretionary leave had not been raised as
      an issue in the grounds for permission to appeal. It had  been  raised
      today for the first time but no copy of the policy had  been  adduced.
      The skeleton argument did not rely  on  it.  The  judge  had  properly
      considered Article 8 and had applied the Razgar test.

  18.       Dr Corban did not wish to add anything further.  That  completed
      the hearing and I then reserved my determination.

Findings and Conclusions

  19.        I deal first of all with the service of the  decision  and  the
      timeliness of the appeal. I take account of regulations 6 and 7 of the
      Immigration (Notices) Regulations 2003 and I also have regard  to  the
      computer print outs from the respondent and the  submissions  made  by
      both sides.  The respondent's evidence shows that on 19 April 2012 the
      application was refused under paragraph 322(1) and 322(1)A, that three
      British passports were  copied  for  the  file  and  returned  to  the
      representatives by recorded delivery number AG127682552GB and that the
      file was transferred to the relevant department "who are liaising with
      LIT to serve". There is also a copy of an envelope addressed to Corban
      Solicitors with recorded delivery number DW 0067 1892 5GB.

  20.       The respondent argues that this evidence demonstrates  that  the
      decision was served on 19 April. The appellant argues that no mail was
      sent on 19 April to the Solicitors because  the  Royal  Mail  tracking
      system does not confirm delivery of the AG  recorded  delivery  number
      and because it does not make sense that the respondent  would  date  a
      refusal notice 20 April, a letter 30 April and post them on 19  April.
      The appellant says nothing about the delivery of the  second  recorded
      delivery item (with the DW reference).

  21.       There is in one of the appellant's bundles  a  letter  from  the
      respondent to the representatives dated 19 April 2012. It is marked as
      received by the Solicitors on 26 April.  It is from Helen  Parkes  and
      confirms that the appellant's application has been passed  to  another
      team and that enclosed with her letter are the passports. This accords
      with the respondent's computer record of that date. It  also  supports
      Dr Corban's submission that a decision was not sent out on  19  April.
      Ms Martin is right to point out  that  the  representatives  have  not
      claimed that the passports were not returned and  indeed  contrary  to
      what is argued in the appellant's response, correspondence of  the  19
      April (which enclosed the passports)  has  been  shown  to  have  been
      received by the appellant's representatives.

  22.       Receipt of  the  letter  of  19  April  (with  passports)  is  a
      different matter to the service of the decision. I do  not  accept  Ms
      Martin's submission that the decision was  sent  with  the  passports.
      Plainly, the letter of 19 April is what was sent and that is supported
      by the computer record. I do not know  when  the  decision  was  first
      served. It may be that it was sent in the DW recorded delivery  packet
      (which a tracking enquiry shows was delivered on 1 July)  but  neither
      party made any submission on this and so I make no  finding  on  that.
      What I do find is that the respondent has  failed  to  establish  that
      notice  of  the  decision  was  served  on  the   appellant   or   his
      representatives before 11 December. As such, I find  that  the  appeal
      was not lodged late.

  23.       The next issue relates to the date of the decision.  The  notice
      of decision, regardless of when it was  served,  is  dated  30  April.
      There is also a letter refusing the Article 8 claim on  20  April  but
      that does not constitute a notice of decision for these purposes. I do
      not accept Dr Corban's submission that the date  of  service  must  be
      treated as the date of the decision. He was unable to point me to  any
      case law or statute to support that submission. Plainly the notice  of
      decision is dated 30 April 2012 and there is no  reason  to  find  any
      other date applies.

  24.       The relevance of the date of decision in any event,  has  little
      impact upon the consideration of the claim. This  was  an  application
      made outside the Immigration Rules on Article 8 grounds. It  was  made
      on  3  February  2012  and  received  on  7  February  and  under  the
      implementation provisions of HC 164 falls to be considered  under  the
      rules in force prior to July 2012. Contrary to the misleading  grounds
      (on which it  would  seem  permission  to  appeal  was  granted),  the
      decision was not 11 December 2012 and paragraph 276ADE and Appendix FM
      did not apply to the appellant's case. Much has, therefore, been  made
      by the appellant's representatives of a point that has no relevance to
      the claim.

  25.       It was argued that the judge should have considered both the old
      and the new Immigration Rules.  There is no merit in this argument and
      no reason was put forward to support it. In any  event,  as  is  plain
      from the letter accompanying the application, the appellant sought  to
      remain  on  Article  8  grounds  with  a  request  for   three   years
      discretionary leave on compassionate grounds as a back up alternative.
      Nowhere in the  letter  is  there  any  reference  to  any  particular
      immigration rule.

  26.       Taking the three grounds put forward into account, therefore,  I
      do not find the first is made out. The criticism that the  Immigration
      Judge (sic) erred in failing to consider  the  new  rules  is  without
      merit for the reasons set out above.

  27.       The next ground is also misleading but was taken at  face  value
      in the grant of permission to appeal. The  judge  was  criticised  for
      making findings on the authenticity of the appellant's passport  when,
      it is said, "no issue on this was raised by the respondent".  That  is
      blatantly wrong. The notice of decision  made  specific  reference  to
      paragraphs  322  (1)  and  322  (1A)  as  the  judge  noted   in   his
      determination. It was the respondent's allegation  that  the  passport
      was a forgery and as such the judge was required to address the issue.
       Contrary to what the grounds argue, the  error  of  the  day  of  the
      appellant's birth (given as 12 and not 18 February) was not  the  only
      mistake in the passport. His place of birth (said to  be  Agwa-Owerri)
      was wrongly stated and not only that but it  was  misspelled  as  Port
      Hacourt.  It is argued that the judge failed to take  account  of  the
      letter  of  27  December  2012  allegedly  issued  by   the   Nigerian
      Immigration Service  which  stated  that  the  date  of  birth  was  a
      typographical error. Even if he had considered that letter,  there  is
      no explanation for why the wrong place of birth and the wrong spelling
      for the place named was given.

  28.       The third ground takes issue with the  Article  8  findings.  It
      appears that permission to appeal was not granted on this point but on
      the  two   previous   grounds   which,   as   I   have   shown,   were
      misrepresentations of the evidence. Nevertheless I  consider  it.  The
      complaint is with the judge's findings on family and/or  private  life
      and the proportionality assessment. It  is  argued  that  the  judge's
      finding on the former is unclear and that the balancing  exercise  was
      not undertaken.

  29.       The judge considered the documentary evidence and found that  he
      could not be satisfied that the appellant and his  partner  (there  is
      contradictory evidence as to whether they entered into  a  traditional
      marriage or are simply in a relationship)  had  lived  together  since
      2007 as claimed. He noted that the appellant's payslips  between  2007
      and 2009 gave a Dagenham address and not  the  Emerson  House  address
      where Ms Jagne lived. He also noted that Ms Jagne  had  been  claiming
      council tax discount as a  single  adult  occupant  at  the  time  the
      appellant was supposed to be living with  her  and  indeed  was  still
      doing so at the date of the hearing. He rejected her  claim  that  she
      thought she could do so because the appellant was  not  working.  That
      explanation is wholly without merit because the appellant has produced
      payslips to show that he was indeed employed at the  time.  The  judge
      noted that whilst there was credible evidence to  show  she  lived  at
      Emerson House, the limited evidence to connect the appellant  to  that
      address conflicted with other documents  from  the  same  time  period
      which gave him a different address. He concluded that the evidence had
      not established that the appellant and Ms Jagne cohabited.  It  is  in
      that context that he made his finding about family and  private  life.
      The finding is clear. He accepted there was a relationship but "not to
      the extent claimed"; i.e. no  cohabitation.  He  found  removal  would
      interfere with family/private life. The remaining  paragraphs  of  the
      determination address the best interests of Ms  Jagne's  children  and
      the proportionality assessment. The judge took into account the Razgar
      steps and applied Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39.  Given  the  appellant's
      deception  and  abuse  of  the  laws  of  this  country  by   entering
      unlawfully, remaining without authority, making an application on  the
      basis of a sham marriage and using a forged  passport,  it  is  hardly
      surprising that the judge found that the public interest had  to  take
      priority and that  removal  was  proportionate.  He  was  entitled  to
      conclude that to permit the appellant to remain  would  be  to  reward
      those who deliberately violate the Immigration  Rules  and  use  false
      documents. He considered that the best interests of the children  were
      to remain with their mother and that the relationship, such as it was,
      could continue by way of other means after he left. He found that  the
      appellant had his mother and siblings in Nigeria and that  they  would
      be able to assist him until he re-established himself. Of course it is
      also open to the appellant once he can meet the  requirements  of  the
      Immigration Rules to make an entry clearance application from Nigeria.



  30.       For the sake of completion I note that Dr Corban argued that the
      judge had erred in failing to consider  whether  the  appellant  could
      qualify for discretionary leave. Despite his  submissions,  I  do  not
      accept that this point was raised in the grounds  for  permission  and
      there has been no application for the grounds to be  amended.  I  note
      that the skeleton argument placed before  the  judge  also  failed  to
      argue this point. Although Dr Corban maintains he  was  sure  he  made
      this point in submissions to the First-tier Tribunal Judge, the Record
      of Proceedings does not record  any  such  argument  in  the  recorded
      submissions. A copy of the policy which Dr Corban relied  on  was  not
      placed before the First-tier Tribunal and  has  not  been  adduced  as
      evidence to the Upper Tribunal. In the circumstances I find  no  error
      of law in this respect.

Decision

  31.       The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not make an error of  law  and
      his decision to dismiss the appeal stands.

      Signed:


      Dr R Keki?
      Judge of the Upper Tribunal
