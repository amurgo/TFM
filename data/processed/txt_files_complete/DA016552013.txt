    Representation:


                            For the Appellant: Ms A Holmes a Senior
           Home Office Presenting Officer
          For the Respondent: Ms L Delgado a Solicitor from Benchmark
Solicitors LLP

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant the Secretary of State for the Home Department.  I  will
      refer to her as the Secretary of State. The respondent is a citizen of
      Jamaica who was born on 3 May  1978.  I  will  refer  to  him  as  the
      claimant. The Secretary of State has been given permission  to  appeal
      the determination of a panel sitting in the First-Tier Tribunal (First-
      Tier Tribunal Judge Stokes and non-legal member Ms J A Endersby).  The
      panel dismissed the claimant's appeal under the Immigration Rules  but
      allowed his appeal on human rights grounds against  the  Secretary  of
      State's decision of 22 July 2013 that Section 32 (5) of the UK Borders
      Act 2007 applied and that she was required to make a deportation order
      against  him  following  his  conviction  for  possessing  a  Class  A
      controlled drug with intent to supply and the  resulting  sentence  of
      two years and six months imprisonment.


   2. The claimant appealed under section 82 (3A) and  92  (4)  (a)  of  the
      Nationality Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  (as  amended)  on  the
      grounds that he fell within exception  1  from  automatic  deportation
      under section 33 (2) of the 2007 Act namely, that  his  removal  would
      breach his Convention rights under Article 8. His appeal was heard  by
      the panel on 5 February  2014.  Both  parties  were  represented,  the
      claimant by Ms Delgado, who appears before me. Oral evidence was given
      by the claimant and his wife. The panel set out the evidence in detail
      between paragraphs  18  and  28  of  the  determination.  The  equally
      detailed findings of credibility and fact appear between paragraphs 29
      and 38. I will not repeat the claimant's immigration  history  or  the
      history of decisions and appeals leading up to the appeal heard by the
      panel. These can be found in paragraphs 1 to 6 of the determination.


   3. The panel concluded that the Secretary of State was required to make a
      deportation order. There was a presumption that  the  public  interest
      required  the  claimant's  deportation.  The   panel   addressed   his
      relationship with his wife, two natural children,  one  stepchild  and
      another child  under  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  399  and  399A,
      concluding that these requirements  were  not  met.  Furthermore,  the
      claimant had not lived in the UK continuously for at  least  20  years
      immediately  preceding  the  date  of  the  deportation  order,  after
      discounting the period of  his  imprisonment.  Under  the  Immigration
      Rules there were  no  other  factors  which  amounted  to  exceptional
      circumstances and outweighed the public interest in  deportation.  The
      Secretary of State's decision was in accordance with  the  Immigration
      Rules and she should not have exercised her discretion under paragraph
      399B differently.


   4. The panel went on to  consider  the  Article  8  grounds  outside  the
      Immigration Rules. After reviewing the case law the panel set out  the
      factors which weighed against the claimant in paragraph 57  and  those
      which weighed in his favour in paragraphs 58 and 59. In doing  so  the
      panel treated the welfare of the claimant's two natural children as  a
      primary  consideration.  In  paragraph  60  the  panel   reached   the
      conclusion that the factors in  favour  of  deportation  were  weighty
      particularly as to the serious view taken by the Secretary of State of
      the claimant's criminality and her legitimate aim to  protect  society
      and to prevent disorder and crime. On the other hand the panel  placed
      considerable importance on the interests of the claimant's two natural
      children. The decision was considered to be finely balanced but in all
      the circumstances was struck in favour of the claimant.  In  paragraph
      62 the panel said; "we find that the decision appealed  against  would
      cause the UK to be in breach of the  law  and  its  obligations  under
      Article 8 ECHR and the appellant's removal  would  have  unjustifiably
      harsh consequences for him and his family such that deportation  would
      not be proportionate to any of the legitimate objectives identified in
      Article 8 (2) of the European Convention." (my emphasis).


   5. The Secretary of State applied  for  and  was  granted  permission  to
      appeal by a judge in the First-Tier Tribunal. There is  one  composite
      ground which argues that the panel erred in law by failing to identify
      exceptional  circumstances   which   would   render   the   claimant's
      deportation unjustifiably harsh. No adequate  consideration  had  been
      given to the public interest and SS (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550  had
      not been followed. It was only in extremely  rare  circumstances  that
      the Tribunal should exercise an  inquisitorial  function  on  its  own
      initiative in evaluating the interests of a child. Reliance  was  also
      placed on Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) and Nagre  [2013]  EWHC  720
      Admin in support of the  submission  that  the  panel  had  failed  to
      recognise that an Article 8 assessment outside the  Immigration  Rules
      should only be carried out where there were  compelling  circumstances
      not recognised by the Rules. The panel had failed to apply the test of
      whether there  were  exceptional  circumstances  namely  circumstances
      which would lead to an unjustifiably harsh outcome.


   6. I have a Rule 24 response from the claimant's solicitors together with
      a helpful composite bundle containing  all  the  material  before  the
      panel and subsequent documents relating to the  appeal  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal.


   7. Ms Holmes relied on the grounds of appeal and submitted that there had
      been no adequate consideration of the public interest. The factors set
      out in paragraph 47, 56 and 57 made only tenuous mention of the public
      interest factors. The panel had failed to grapple with the  principles
      set out in OH (Serbia) [2008] EWCA Civ 694 of  which  no  mention  had
      been made. In reply to my question, Ms Holmes  accepted  that  OH  was
      addressed in the subsequent judgement of the Court  of  Appeal  in  SS
      (Nigeria) and that the panel  referred  to  both  Gulshan  and  Nagre.
      Overall, she submitted that the panel had not done enough in  relation
      to considering the  public  interest.  Ms  Holmes  accepted  that  the
      grounds did not attack the panel's findings of  credibility  or  fact.
      She accepted that the  words  "unjustifiably  harsh  consequences"  in
      paragraph 62 were "quite muscular". I was asked to find that the panel
      had erred in law, to set aside the decision and remake it.


   8. Ms Delgado relied on the Rule 24  response.  She  submitted  that  the
      panel had dealt with all  necessary  issues,  in  the  correct  order,
      referring to all relevant  case  law.  SS  Nigeria  was  addressed  in
      paragraph 56 and a correct prï¿½cis of the effect of this  set  out.  In
      paragraph 57 the panel summarised the factors which militated  against
      the claimant and in paragraph 59 those in his favour. Whilst there was
      no reference to OH Serbia  the  required  factors  were  addressed  in
      paragraph 59. The panel had properly weighed all the relevant factors.
      The grounds of appeal argued that the panel failed to consider whether
      there were "compelling circumstances" or "exceptional  circumstances".
      Ms Delgado argued that this was exactly what the panel had done  when,
      in paragraph 62, they summarised  the  test  of  "unjustifiably  harsh
      consequences for him and his family". I was asked  to  find  that  the
      panel had not erred in law and to uphold the determination.


   9. Ms Holmes said  that  she  did  not  wish  to  reply.  I  reserved  my
      determination.


  10. I find that the panel prepared a detailed and  careful  determination.
      The evidence is comprehensively set out and  carefully  assessed.  The
      panel reached credibility findings and findings of fact which have not
      been disputed by the Secretary of State. There was no overall positive
      credibility finding in relation to the evidence of the claimant or his
      wife. Some important aspects of their evidence were not accepted.  The
      Secretary of State makes no complaint  about  the  panel's  conclusion
      that the claimant failed under paragraphs 399, 399A and  399B  of  the
      Immigration Rules. The grounds submit that the errors of law  were  in
      relation to the assessment of the appeal on  Article  8  human  rights
      grounds outside the Immigration Rules.


  11. Whilst OH Serbia is not  referred  to  in  the  Secretary  of  State's
      grounds of appeal Ms Holmes argued that the panel did not address  the
      principles set out in paragraph 15 where Wilson LJ said;


         "From the above passages in N (Kenya) I collect the following
         propositions:
         (a) The risk of reoffending is one facet of the public interest
         but, in the case of very serious crimes, not the most important
         facet.
         (b) Another important facet is the need to deter foreign nationals
         from committing serious crimes by leading them to understand that,
         whatever the other circumstances, one consequence of them may well
         be deportation.
         (c) A further important facet is the role of a deportation order as
         an expression of society's revulsion at serious crimes and in
         building public confidence in the treatment of foreign citizens who
         have committed serious crimes.
         (d) Primary responsibility for the public interest, whose view of
         it is likely to be wider and better informed than that of a
         tribunal, resides in the respondent and accordingly a tribunal
         hearing an appeal against a decision to deport should not only
         consider for itself all the facets of the public interest but
         should weigh, as a linked but independent feature, the approach to
         them adopted by the respondent in the context of the facts of the
         case. Speaking for myself, I would not however describe the
         tribunal's duty in this regard as being higher than "to weigh" this
         feature."
  12. Although this was not raised in the grounds of appeal and there was no
      application to amend the grounds I find that the panel did not fail to
      apply these principles.  There  is  the  self-direction  contained  in
      paragraph 57 and the reference to the opinion of Lord Bingham in Huang
      v SSHD [2007] UKHL 11 at paragraph 16 quoted at length, in  particular
      the passage which deals with the treatment  of  foreign  citizens  who
      have   committed   serious   crimes;   "The   general   administrative
      desirability of applying  known  rules  if  a  system  of  immigration
      control is to be workable, predictable, consistent and fair as between
      one applicant in  another;  the  damage  to  good  administration  and
      effective control  if  the  system  is  perceived  by  the  applicants
      internationally to be unduly porous, unpredictable or perfunctory; the
      need to discourage non-nationals admitted to the  country  temporarily
      from believing that they can commit serious crimes and yet be  allowed
      to remain; the need to  discourage  fraud,  deception  and  deliberate
      breaches of the law; and so on." The panel also weighed in the balance
      material factors such as the judge's sentencing  remarks,  the  single
      drug dealing offence, the fact that the claimant had  come  off  drugs
      and the low risk of further offending.


  13. In paragraph 47 the panel set out relevant aspects of the judgement of
      the Court of Appeal in MF  (Nigeria)  v  SSHD  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192
      including "The  reference  to  exceptional  circumstances  serves  the
      purpose of emphasising that, in the balancing exercise,  great  weight
      should be given to the public interest in deporting foreign  criminals
      who do not satisfy  paragraphs  398  and  399  or  399A.  It  is  only
      exceptionally that such foreign criminals will succeed in showing that
      their rights under Article 8 (1) trumps the public interest  in  their
      deportation" and "In our view, (this) is not to say  that  a  test  of
      exceptionality is being applied. Rather it is that, in approaching the
      question of whether removal is a proportionate  interference  with  an
      individual's Article 8 rights, the  scales  are  heavily  weighted  in
      favour of deportation and something very  compelling  (which  will  be
      "exceptional")  is  required  to  outweigh  the  public  interest   in
      removal".


  14. In paragraph 56 the panel referred to SS Nigeria and the conclusion of
      the Court of Appeal "That the  State's  policy  in  deporting  foreign
      criminals must be given great weight where that policy is made by  the
      legislature and not by the executive government. There is no  rule  of
      exceptionality but the more pressing the public interest in removal or
      deportation the stronger must be the claim under Article 8 if it is to
      prevail." The panel went on to say that regard had been given  to  the
      extensive case law referred to earlier in the determination.


  15. Ms Holmes did not refer to any particular passage  in  SS  Nigeria  in
      support of the proposition that "Only an extremely rare  circumstances
      should a Tribunal  exercise  an  inquisitorial  function  on  its  own
      initiative in evaluating the interests of such a child". In any  event
      I cannot find any indication that the panel exercised an inquisitorial
      function in evaluating the interests  of  any  of  the  children.  The
      evaluation of the interests of the children was carried out solely  on
      the basis of the evidence submitted to the panel.


  16. I find that there are clear indications that the panel had in mind and
      took into account that exceptional or  very  compelling  circumstances
      were needed if the claimant was to overcome the  great  weight  to  be
      given to the strong public interest  in  deportation.  This  was  done
      firstly, in relation to the appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules,  in
      Paragraph 46. There is the reference to MF (Nigeria) and  "exceptional
      circumstances", "exceptionally",  "something  very  compelling  (which
      will be "exceptional")" in  paragraph  47  to  which  I  have  already
      referred. There is reference to Gulshan and "compelling circumstances"
      in paragraph 48. I have already set out what the panel said about  the
      effect of SS (Nigeria) in paragraph 56.  The  panel  referred  to  the
      particularly serious crime committed by the appellant namely  the  use
      of and dealing in drugs, in paragraph 57. Finally, and by way of  what
      I find to be crucial emphasis in the final  conclusion  of  the  panel
      there  is  reference  to  the  removal  of  the  claimant  leading  to
      "unjustifiably harsh consequences" for him and his family in paragraph
      62.


  17. The panel  made  an  anonymity  direction  in  order  to  protect  the
      interests of the minor children. I consider that it  is  necessary  to
      continue the direction. I make an order under Rule 14 of the  Tribunal
      Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 prohibiting  the  disclosure  or
      publication of any matter likely to lead  members  of  the  public  to
      identify the appellant or any member of his family.


  18. I find that the panel did apply the correct  tests  in  assessing  the
      Article 8 grounds. As was said in paragraph 60 the decision was finely
      balanced but I find that it was one open  to  the  panel  on  all  the
      evidence. There is no error of law and I uphold the determination.
