                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
        Callender-Smith promulgated on 26 September 2016 in which the Judge
        dismissed the appellant's appeal against the  respondent's  refusal
        to grant him a Residence  Card  confirming  a  permanent  right  of
        residence in the UK.









Background


     2. The appellant, a citizen of Nigeria, was born on 13 February  1972.
        The Judge noted the appellant entered the UK on an unknown date but
        on 17 May 2010 applied for a residence card  as  recognition  of  a
        right to reside in the United Kingdom  as  the  spouse  of  an  EEA
        national exercising treaty rights in the UK. On 18 October 2010 the
        application was granted.
     3. On 15 January 2015, the appellant applied for a Permanent Residence
        Card which was  rejected  in  a  notice  dated  3  June  2015.  The
        respondent's formal  refusal  stated  she  was  not  satisfied  the
        appellant had provided evidence that the EEA  national  resided  in
        the UK in accordance with the Immigration (European Economic  Area)
        Regulations  during  the  five-year  period  relied  upon  by   the
        appellant and also  noted  that  the  marriage  was  considered  as
        bigamous and one of convenience.
     4. The Judge sets out findings of fact between [19-26] of the decision
        under challenge which may be summarised in the following terms:


             a. The appellant's marriage ended in  divorce.  The  appellant
                did not know where his wife was which meant  he  could  not
                produce any extra evidence of her having been in the UK for
                the last five years although he produced documents  showing
                his former wife had been exercising treaty rights  for  the
                period 2010 to 2014.  They  were  divorced  that  September
                [20].
             b. The appellant maintains the respondent would have been able
                to check his former wife's records [21].
             c. The appellant maintains the respondent had  not  considered
                properly  whether  the   appellant   satisfied   Regulation
                15(1)(f) [22].
             d. The Judge was asked  to  accept  that  because  the  decree
                absolute is dated 18  September  2014  it  follows  on  the
                balance of probabilities that the  former  spouse,  an  EEA
                national, was working and exercising treaty rights on  that
                date [24]
             e. The Judge was not satisfied,  in  what  was  a  substantial
                documentary appeal bundle of some 436 pages, that there was
                sufficient  evidence  to  determine,  on  the  balance   of
                probabilities, that the couple had lived together for  over
                five years and that  the  appellant  was  able  to  satisfy
                Regulation 15 in such a way as  to  allow  this  appeal  to
                succeed [26].


     5. The appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  which  was  initially
        refused by another judge of the First-tier Tribunal but granted  on
        a renewed application by the Upper Tribunal  on  17  May  2017,  on
        limited grounds. The operative part  of  the  grant  being  in  the
        following terms:


             In order to show that he had acquired permanent residence, the
             appellant had to show he  had  been  resident  either  as  the
             family member of an EEA national exercising Treaty  Rights  of
             as a family member who had retained the right of residence.


             It is arguable  that  the  judge  erred  in  failing  to  make
             findings (a) as to the period in which  the  appellant's  wife
             had been exercising Treaty Rights; (b) as to whether the other
             requirements  of  Rega.10(5)  were  met;  and,   whether   the
             requirements of reg.10(6) were met. The judge appears at  [26]
             to have misdirected himself in concluding  that  evidence  was
             required that the couple  had  lived  together  where  is  the
             requirement is only that (during the validity of the marriage)
             they resided in the same country - Ogierakhi [2014]  C-244/13.
             Permission is granted on the grounds that the  judge  arguably
             erred in his application of the EEA Regulations.


     6. In her rule 24 response dated 31 May 2017 the  Secretary  of  State
        accepted the First-tier Judge misrepresented himself at [26] but in
        the absence of the appellant's appeal bundle, did not concede  that
        the error was material to the outcome of the appeal.




Error of law


     7. Discussions at the outset of the  proceedings  disclosed  that  the
        bundle provided to Mr West, which his solicitors claimed  was  that
        before the First-tier Tribunal, was not the same as there were over
        60 pages missing from the bundle in  his  possession.  It  was  not
        therefore clear whether this  bundle  was  that  before  the  Judge
        containing information on which the decision was based. The  bundle
        was not admitted for if it contained different information  it  was
        not served until the day and if fresh documents  were  relied  upon
        the permission  of  the  Tribunal  would  have  been  required.  Ms
        Isherwood confirmed that what she wanted to see was evidence of the
        EEA national exercising treaty rights in the UK. During the  course
        of  the  hearing  those  instructing  Mr  West  provided  him  with
        additional documentary evidence which ensured he had the missing 60
        pages in his possession.
     8. Mr West also accepted the scope  of  the  grant  of  permission  to
        appeal in its limited terms, which had not  granted  permission  in
        relation to the grounds of challenge asserting legal error  in  the
        assessment of the human rights ground  which  was  found  to  be  a
        ground that had no merit in an EEA Regulation appeal.
     9. It was accepted  the  issue  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  the
        materiality of the identified error.
    10. Mr West referred to the finding by  the  Judge  at  [26]  which  he
        submitted was misconceived. The exact  wording  of  this  paragraph
        reads:


         26.  I am not satisfied however, on the evidence in what was a very
             substantial documentary appeal bundle running  to  436  pages,
             that there is sufficient evidence for me to determine, on  the
             balance of probabilities, that the couple had  lived  together
             for over five years and that  he  had  been  able  to  satisfy
             Regulation 15 in such  a  way  as  to  allow  this  appeal  to
             succeed.


    11. At [20] the Judge refers to evidence regarding the position of  the
        EEA national from 2010 to 2014. Mr West referred to a  document  at
        page 428 of the bundle before the Judge which is a document from HM
        Revenue and Customs addressed to the EEA  national  dated  24  July
        2014 referring to an amended Tax Credit  award  for  the  period  6
        April 2014 to 15 April 2015. This relates to  a  Child  Tax  Credit
        although of the six pages of the original document only pages 1,  3
        and 5 have been disclosed. It may have assisted if a complete  copy
        of the document  had  been  provided  as  Part  1  should  show  an
        applicant's circumstances, including their income.
    12. The extent of the disclosed information is of some importance for a
        person may claim Child Tax  Credit  if  they  are  responsible  for
        children either: aged 16 or under - until  31  August  after  their
        16th birthday, or under 20 and in eligible education or training. A
        claimant does not need to be working to  claim  Child  Tax  Credit.
        Being a recipient of this benefit is therefore not determinative of
        the EEA national exercising treaty rights as a worker.
    13. It is also noted on page 3 of 6 under the heading 'Part  2  How  we
        work out your tax credits' that the following text appears:


         The amounts shown in this  Part  are  provisional  to  your  actual
         income and personal circumstances are known and  we  make  a  final
         decision after 5 April 2015.


         Tax credits are made up of elements. The elements  you  receive  in
         the period you receive them for are shown below.  Your  income  may
         reduce  the  amount  of  tax  credits  you  receive.  We  show  any
         reductions below.


    14. Under the heading "Working Tax Credit elements" the following  text
        appears:


         You are not entitled to Working Tax Credit.


    15. Working Tax Credit is designed to top up a claimant's  earnings  if
        they work and are on a low income. Persons  not  earning  therefore
        not liable to receive Working Tax Credit.
    16. Depending on circumstances, a person may be able to  claim  Working
        Tax Credit if they are aged between 16 and 24 and have a child,  or
        a disability, or 25 or over and working a minimum number of  hours.
        For a single person with one or more children this is 16 hours, for
        a couple with one or more  children   usually  at  least  24  hours
        between them, of which one is expected to work at least  16  hours.
        No evidence has  been  provided  relating  to  the  EEA  national's
        employment situation to ascertain whether she is employed.
    17. The Tribunal is also aware that in relation to Working Tax  credits
        there is an income threshold. An example in the 2017-18  assessment
        is that if a person is annual household income is �6,420 or  below,
        they will get the  maximum  amount  for  each  Working  Tax  Credit
        element they qualify for but if their income is  above  that  limit
        this well reduce the amount of benefit they receive.
    18. It is possible for a person to be excluded from Working Tax  credit
        if they or their partner  earn  over  a  certain  amount,  commonly
        referred to as the annual household income  limit.  The  difficulty
        for the appellant is that the lack of evidence provided prevents  a
        finding been made that the reason the EEA  national  has  not  been
        awarded Working Tax Credit is because the income available  to  her
        exceeds the annual household income limit.
    19. The evidence provided to the Upper Tribunal does not ascertain  the
        reason the EEA national was not entitled to Working Tax Credits  or
        the rate of income against which the Child Tax Credit was assessed.
        What  is  hoped  is  that  information  regarding  the  method   of
        calculation has not been deliberately omitted  from  the  disclosed
        documents as that would give rise to concerns of a lack of  candour
        on the appellant's behalf.
    20. The requirement for the appellant  to  prove  his  marriage  lasted
        three years and that he lived in United Kingdom for a period of one
        year is not an issue in this appeal  for  although  the  respondent
        refers to an element of bigamy in  the  refusal  notice  the  Judge
        noted at [23] that the Presenting Officer was unable to provide any
        evidence about the bigamy allegation. Although no specific findings
        made it can be inferred from the decision that the Judge found this
        element not to have been proved in relation to which  there  is  no
        cross-appeal by the Secretary of State.
    21. Mr West referred to a number of documents in the  bundle  and  copy
        wage slips for the EEA national including at page 349 what  appears
        to be a blank P60 for the year ending 5 April 2013 although at page
        350 a completed P60 for the year ending  5  April  2014  showing  a
        gross income of �5,700.
    22. At page 180 is a copy of the appellant's wage slip for the work  he
        has undertaken with the NHS. It is stated the  appellant  continues
        to be employed by the NHS.
    23. The assertion by the appellant that the burden was  upon  Secretary
        of State to undertake checks to prove the  EEA  nationals  position
        has no arguable merit as  the  burden  is  upon  the  appellant  to
        establish his position. There is no  transfer  or  sharing  of  the
        burden of proof in cases of this nature.
    24. It is accepted on the respondent's behalf that  the  appellant  had
        proved  that  he  personally  satisfied  the  requirements  of  the
        Regulations as a result of his ongoing employment with the NHS  and
        that the only issue was that relating to the status of the sponsor.
    25. The Judge referred to the sponsor's payslips and concern was raised
        as to how the appellant had obtained the blank P60 although  it  is
        accepted the P60 for the year to 5  April  2014  reflects  the  EEA
        nationals address appearing on other items of correspondence. There
        is reference to various bills including the payment of a  catalogue
        account  addressed  to  the  EEA  national  at  an  address  in   [
           ], the address appearing on the 2014  P60,  dated  21  May  2016
        showing a balance due for purchases.  Ms  Isherwood  submitted  the
        evidence provided to the Judge  did  not  support  the  appellant's
        assertion with regard to the relevant period in 2014 and then jumps
        to 2016.
    26. It was submitted that it is clear in the decision that although the
        Judge may have misdirected himself at [26] it is  not  material  as
        the Judge considered the documents that have been provided did  not
        prove the point that the EEA national was exercising treaty  rights
        at the date of the dissolution of the marriage.
    27. In reply Mr West accepted the P60 referred to above was  blank  but
        submitted the evidence showed the  EEA  national  worked  to  April
        2014. It was submitted the Judge failed  to  take  the  April  2015
        Child Tax Credits into account and that when all this evidence  was
        taken together it proved the EEA  national  was  exercising  treaty
        rights and working at the date of divorce.
    28. Whilst no explanation for the 2016 documents could be given, it was
        submitted  on  the  appellant's  behalf  that  he   satisfied   the
        requirements of Regulation 10(5)  as  the  EEA  national  had  been
        exercising treaty rights for the period of five years working  back
        from the date of divorce. Mr West accepted  the  relevant  starting
        period was April 2010. It was also submitted that the  requirements
        of Regulation 10(6) are also satisfied.
    29. In relation to the three elements the  appellant  was  required  to
        prove to the Judge being (1) that a  genuine  marriage  had  lasted
        three years and the couple had spent one year  together  in  United
        Kingdom, this is not an issue in dispute; (2) that the  couple  had
        spent one year together in the United Kingdom is not  an  issue  in
        dispute; (3) that the EEA national  spouse  was  exercising  treaty
        rights at the time the appellant ceased to be a family member, i.e.
        at the date of divorce, this an issue in dispute.
    30. The assertion by the appellant that to establish the  EEA  national
        spouse's position there was a shared burden with the  Secretary  of
        State has no arguable merit -see Amos v Secretary of State for  the
        Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ 552 in which the  Court  of  Appeal
        held that a divorced spouse had to establish that he or she had the
        right of residence before the question whether, notwithstanding the
        divorce, the right had been retained could be determined.
    31. The  Court  of  Appeal  found  the  EEA  national  must  have  been
        exercising treaty rights up to the date of divorce, but  thereafter
        that is not required. What is required is that after  the  divorce,
        the non-EEA national former spouse must  himself  exercise  'Treaty
        rights', in the sense of being a worker or self-employed  or  self-
        sufficient. That is the requirement in Article 13 of  the  Citizens
        Directive reproduced of regulation 10(6) of the  2006  Regulations.
        If the third country national continues to do that up to the  five-
        year point,  he  will  have  "resided  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
        accordance  with  these  Regulations"  and  will  have  acquired  a
        permanent right of residence under regulation 15(1)(f).
    32. The five-year period from  the  date  of  the  dissolution  of  the
        marriage has not yet passed meaning this discreet  point  does  not
        arguably assist the appellant at this stage.  The Court  of  Appeal
        in Amos also held that it must still be shown that the EEA national
        was  working  or  otherwise  exercising  treaty  rights  until  the
        termination of the marriage.
    33. The issue is, therefore, as identified at the  outset  the  hearing
        whether the  Judge  erred  in  finding  that  the  appeal  must  be
        dismissed. If, having considered the material made  available  this
        was the only arguable conclusion the Judge could have arrived at if
        he  had  applied  the  correct  test,  any  error  based  upon  the
        misdirection at [26] is not material.
    34. It is not disputed the  EEA  national  has  worked  in  the  United
        Kingdom for a considerable period  of  time,  indeed  there  are  a
        number of documents referring to employment in 2010. The blank  P60
        for 2013 raises a number of questions as to how the appellant  came
        into possession of a formal tax document although all that  can  be
        said if this document is produced as evidence is that there  is  no
        indication this relates to the EEA national and  does  not  confirm
        the EEA national was in employment during that tax year.
    35. There does appear to be evidence indicating the EEA national has  a
        variable employment history. There is for example a letter  from  a
        credit  card  company  albeit  dated  5  July  2016  providing   an
        opportunity to settle a credit card  balance  following  which  the
        company will not pursue a Capital One  Bank  (Europe)  credit  card
        debt further, which is ordinarily a solution undertaken  for  those
        who have financial problems and are unable to settle an outstanding
        debt.
    36. The P60 for the year ending 5 April 2014 is said to relate  to  the
        EEA national but does not prove details of the period  within  this
        tax year for which the EEA national was employed. A total of  �5700
        gross income for the tax year is a gross income of  �109  per  week
        gross but insufficient evidence  has  been  provided  to  establish
        employment after this period.
    37. Mr West submits the Tribunal should infer that as the EEA  national
        was working for the period 2010 to April 2014 it  was  more  likely
        than not that she continued to remain in employment at the date  of
        the dissolution of the marriage. Reliance was placed upon the Child
        Tax Credit award for the period 2014 2015 to support this argument.
    38. As noted above, the difficulty with this submission is  that  there
        is insufficient evidence to establish the EEA national was actually
        working at the relevant period and the Child Tax  Credit  documents
        confirm that such an award may be made even if a person is  not  in
        employment. The EEA  national  was  not  entitled  to  Working  Tax
        Credits but the failure to  disclose  any  evidence  regarding  her
        income does not establish whether  this  is  because  she  was  not
        working and therefore did not have a qualifying income  or  because
        the  income  earned  took  the  EEA  national  outside  the  income
        threshold for receiving this benefit.
    39. It is also noted above that there has been a partial disclosure  of
        the Child Tax Credit award omitting from the documents provided the
        information which sets out the basis on which  the  assessment  had
        been made which includes  details  of  any  income  earned  by  the
        claimant, i.e. the EEA national.
    40.  Considering  the  evidence   made   available   the   balance   of
        probabilities  favours  a  finding  the  appellant  has  failed  to
        discharge the burden of proof upon him to the required standard  to
        show  the  date  of  the  decree  absolute  the  EEA  national  was
        exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom. Although there is a
        long history of previous employment documentary  evidence  for  the
        relevant period, including  that  relating  to  2013,  raises  more
        questions than the previous history answers in relation to this key
        issue. The exercise of treaty rights by the EEA national from April
        2010 to 5 April 2014 was arguably established before the Judge  but
        not further.
    41. Whilst there is sympathy for individuals in  the  position  of  the
        appellant in this case  it  is  clear  some  information  has  been
        obtained and the whereabouts of the EEA national must be known,  as
        disclosed by the address on the financial documents provided in the
        bundle. As noted by the Court of  Appeal  in  Amos,  the  appellant
        could have sought a direction for the Secretary of State to provide
        any necessary information for the determination of the appeal  from
        the First-tier Tribunal but failed to do so.  It  is  accepted  the
        Secretary of State can only provide information she  already  holds
        although it is known the Home Office has  an  informal  arrangement
        with HMRC enabling a number of enquiries to be made each month. The
        evidence does not suggest that even a request for the Secretary  of
        State to use such a facility was made in relation to this appeal.
    42. On the basis of the evidence considered by the Upper Tribunal,  and
        despite the best endeavours of Mr West, it has to be found that the
        appellant has failed to discharge the burden of proof upon  him  to
        establish that the identified legal error  made  by  the  Judge  is
        material to the decision to dismiss the  appeal.  Accordingly,  the
        determination shall stand.



Decision

    43. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    44. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


        I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
