Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms G Peterson of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, a Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  appellant
    is granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
    indirectly identify him or any member of their family.  This  direction
    applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply
    with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan born on 1 January  2000.   He
    entered the UK illegally on or  about  2  September  2016  and  claimed
    asylum.  The respondent refused the appellant's claim for asylum on  15
    April 2016.  As the appellant is an unaccompanied minor he was  granted
    temporary discretionary leave under paragraphs 352ZC to  352ZF  of  the
    Immigration Rules HC395 (as amended) until 1 July 2017 at  which  point
    he will be aged 17�.

The appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 3. The appellant appealed against the respondent's decision to the  First-
    tier Tribunal.   In a decision promulgated on 10  October  2016  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge R Scott dismissed the appellant's appeal.

The appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 4. The appellant applied for permission to appeal against  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision to the Upper Tribunal.  On 4 November  2016  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Osborne refused the appellant permission to appeal.
     In a renewed application for permission to appeal Upper Tribunal Judge
    Taylor granted the appellant permission to appeal on 8  December  2016.
    Thus, the appeal came before me.

 5. The grounds for permission to appeal set out four  grounds.   Ground  1
    asserts that the judge failed to take into  account  properly  all  the
    evidence in relation to the appellant's experience in  Afghanistan  and
    failed to apply the proper standard of proof in relation  to  his  age,
    therefore, the credibility findings are flawed.  It is  submitted  that
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  rejected  the  appellant's  account  of  his
    family's experiences with the Taliban because the  appellant  gave  two
    different accounts of his whereabouts when they visited his home in his
    absence.  The appellant gave a further explanation  for  this  in  oral
    evidence and explained that he had had difficulties with  interpreters.
    This explanation is not recorded by the judge who merely, recorded  the
    inconsistencies.  It is submitted  that  the  judge  was  addressed  at
    length about the correct approach to the evidence of  minors  and  that
    the assessment of the appellant's credibility  is  inadequate  without,
    for example, an assessment and correlation to the  background  evidence
    or the necessity in such circumstances to evaluate the evidence in  its
    totality despite seeming discrepancies.  The failure to properly assess
    the evidence in light of the guidelines for the assessment of  evidence
    of minors which has resulted in a negative credibility  finding  was  a
    material error of law.

 6. Ground 2 asserts that the judge failed to properly address the risk  to
    the appellant in his home area from recruitment into the Taliban.  Even
    if the appellant's account of the  targeting  of  his  family  was  not
    accepted the judge failed to properly assess the risk to the  appellant
    in the light of his personal characteristics.  It is submitted that the
    background material relied upon by the respondent and  in  turn  relied
    upon by the judge states that the Taliban do not forcibly recruit young
    men into their ranks but it was submitted that the evidence  about  the
    recruitment of young men by the Taliban is highly selective and it goes
    against the findings  of  the  Tribunal  in  AA  (unattended  children)
    Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00016 (IAC). This case provides the most up-
    to-date assessment of the background information regarding the risks to
    young men from the Taliban.  Paragraphs 59, 74 and 75  are  relied  on.
    The conclusions in AA  were  confirmed  by  the  UNHCR  in  July  2012,
    reference is made to various paragraphs from the UNHCR Guidelines.   It
    is asserted that when assessing the risk to the appellant in  his  home
    area the judge failed to consider important elements  of  his  accepted
    account particularly, whether in his home area he would, as a young man
    of 17� years be able to resist any overtures by the Taliban or  whether
    his widowed mother, as the female head of his household, would be  able
    to protect him.  It is asserted that this lack of proper findings  went
    to the core of the appellant's account and to the findings  in  respect
    of international relocation and was an error of law.

 7. In relation to ground 3 it is asserted that the judge  failed  to  make
    proper findings on the risk on return to the appellant with  regard  to
    his ability to sustain himself without family support in Kabul and that
    the judge failed to make proper findings with regard to  the  perceived
    family support the appellant might have in other parts of  Afghanistan.
    It is asserted that the failure of the judge to  make  proper  findings
    about the risk to the appellant in his home area  further  infects  his
    findings about whether the appellant can relocate  to  live  in  Kabul.
    The judge has failed to properly determine the  risk  of  serious  harm
    given the clear risks to civilians  living  unsupported  outside  their
    home areas as is extensively outlined in  the  background  information.
    Reference is made to the UNHCR eligibility guidelines for assessing the
    international protection needs  of  asylum  seekers  from  Afghanistan,
    United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), August 2013.

         Refugee  status  under  the   1951   Convention,   people   fleeing
         Afghanistan may be at risk of  persecution  for  reasons  that  are
         related to the ongoing armed conflict in  Afghanistan,  or  on  the
         basis of serious human rights  violations  that  are  not  directly
         related to the conflict,  or  a  combination  of  the  two.   UNHCR
         considers that  in  relation  to  individuals  with  the  following
         profiles a particularly careful examination of  possible  risks  as
         required:

         ...

         (iii)    Men and Boys of Fighting Age

             ...

 8. It is submitted that  the  UNHCR  Guidelines  stress  that  whether  an
    internal flight alternative or an internal  relocation  alternative  is
    reasonable must be determined  on  a  case-by-case  basis  taking  into
    account the personal  circumstances  of  the  appellant  including  the
    impact of any past persecution on the appellant.  It is  asserted  that
    the UNHCR considers that IFA/IRA is not available in areas affected  by
    active conflict, for other areas  of  Afghanistan  an  internal  flight
    option would only be available if the claimant is able to live there in
    safety and security free from danger and risk of  injury.  Evidence  of
    the vulnerability of the  appellant  was  provided  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in the form of the After Return Refugee Support Network Report
    April 2016 in addition to the following submissions:

         (a)  there is no safe or reasonable option in relocation to  Kabul:
             it is submitted that the appellant, who has a  credible  well-
             founded fear of persecution in their home area  cannot  safely
             and reasonably relocate to  Kabul.   In  his  case  the  issue
             arises whether for those persons at risk of persecution and/or
             serious harm in their home  area  can  safely  and  reasonably
             relocate  to  Kabul  now  in  light  of  the  significant  and
             compelling new evidence as to the conditions there;

         (b)  the appellant is a formerly looked after child and in light of
             the current and deteriorating country situation in Afghanistan
             the proposition in JS (Former unaccompanied  child  -  durable
             solution) Afghanistan [2013] UKUT 00568 (IAC)  is  applicable;
             and

         (c)   forced  removal  to  Kabul  of  those  by  reason   of   such
             vulnerability  was  in  contravention  of  the  terms  of  the
             respondent's policy and removals as set out in her Operational
             Guidance Note of February 2015.

 9. The judge determined that the appellant's family could provide  support
    to the appellant in Kabul.  There is no evidence  that  he  had  family
    members in Kabul.   Further,  with  regard  to  his  finding  that  the
    appellant had family in his home area upon whom he could  rely,  it  is
    submitted that this determination is further inadequate, the judge  has
    failed to consider how the appellant would travel  unsupported  through
    conflict areas to reach his home area.

10. Ground 4 argues that the judge has  failed  to  properly  consider  the
    personal circumstances and the private life of  the  appellant  in  his
    assessment of whether it is reasonable for him to reintegrate either in
    his home area or in another part of Afghanistan.  At the hearing before
    me this ground was not pursued with any  vigour.   Mr  Tufan  submitted
    that as the appellant has been granted discretionary  leave  to  remain
    paragraph 276ADE of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  Article  8  are  not
    relevant at this stage.  In this case there is no removal decision  and
    therefore the First-tier Tribunal ought not to have dealt with  Article
    8 in any event.  Ms Peterson  submitted  that  the  arguments  made  on
    reintegration fed into the reasonableness of relocation in any event.

11. At the hearing before me in oral submissions Ms Peterson indicated that
    since the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal the appellant has been
    in touch with his family and has a number of documents sent by  way  of
    pictures on a mobile phone.  It was submitted that if an error  of  law
    was found the appellant would seek to adduce this evidence. Ms Peterson
    accepted that this was not relevant to the error of law hearing.

12. With regard to ground 1 Ms Peterson submitted that the appellant is not
    able to read or write in his own language.  The credibility findings at
    paragraphs 38 to 45  centre  on  inconsistencies  in  relation  to  the
    whereabouts of the appellant when two events occurred, when his brother
    was  killed  and  when  the  Taliban  came  looking   for   him.    The
    discrepancies were put to  the  appellant  but  his  replies  were  not
    recorded.  The appellant's evidence  was  that  on  the  days  that  he
    visited the mosque he also  visited  his  uncle.   She  submitted  that
    nowhere in the assessment  of  the  appellant's  account  is  there  an
    assessment of the objective evidence in the appellant's home area.  The
    objective evidence before the First-tier Tribunal and  in  the  lengthy
    submissions was that the Taliban have a stronghold in  the  appellant's
    home area.  The Home Office says  that  the  Taliban  do  not  forcibly
    recruit but lengthy submissions on the UNHCR guidelines  were  made  to
    the First-tier Tribunal.  She submitted that given that  this  was  the
    evidence of a child all the submissions made regarding the child should
    have been taken into consideration.  A child would not be cognisant  of
    the reasons for being sent abroad.

13. In relation to ground 2  she  submitted  that  in  AK  (Article  15(c))
    Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00163 (IAC) ('AK')  the  authorities  stress
    that the individual's circumstances need to be looked at.  She stressed
    that there is conflict in the area that the appellant lived.  The UNHCR
    guidelines set out the risks to young men and also where  there  is  no
    resident male.  The appellant's father is deceased.  She submitted that
    there was no  finding  with  regard  to  the  particular  risk  in  the
    appellant's home area.  With regard to  family  support  in  Kabul  she
    referred to paragraph 245 of AK and asked how the appellant  would  get
    to his home area in the first place as it is an area of conflict.   She
    referred to the January Foreign Office warnings which set out there  is
    insurgent action every day in the eastern provinces and that the routes
    out of Kabul are dangerous.  This was  submitted  to  the  judge.   She
    submitted it is not enough to rely on a general reference to  AK  which
    is what the judge did in paragraph 47.  With regard to the  submissions
    made in September the appellant has now  been  able  to  speak  to  his
    mother.  She submitted there has been an  assumption  that  the  family
    will assist the appellant in Kabul because they helped him to leave the
    country.  There are a lack of findings as to how they will support  him
    from their home area to Kabul because this support would have  to  take
    place through a conflict area. He is a  young  man  being  returned  to
    Kabul, he does not read or write in his own language.  She referred  to
    paragraphs 57 and 58 which set  out  that  he  would  not  be  returned
    without help, however because of his  youth  and  the  question  as  to
    whether there would be any support that could be relied  on  there  has
    been no reflection of his  individual  circumstances.   She  said  that
    although submissions had been made on reintegration the Refugee Support
    Network report prepared in April 2016 sets out that  young  people  who
    are westernised or perceived as westernised could find themselves at an
    increased risk.  Although the judge sets out  that  the  appellant  has
    demonstrated resourcefulness travelling across the world this was under
    the guidance of the agents.  He is looked after in the United  Kingdom.



14. Mr Tufan referred to paragraph 44 of the First-tier  Tribunal  decision
    and submitted that the judge was alert to the fact that  the  appellant
    was a minor and has considered the  evidence  in  light  of  that.   He
    submitted that the discrepancies have  been  blamed  on  interpretation
    issues but the judge considered that this explanation could not account
    for the inconsistencies.  The judge refers to the salient issues  which
    he considered in some detail, for example,  paragraphs  40  -  43.   He
    submitted it is now suggested that  when  the  appellant  went  to  the
    mosque he  also  went  to  the  uncle's  house  but  this  was  not  an
    explanation given previously.  He  submitted  that  AK  was  still  the
    country guidance  case  that  was  to  be  followed  unless  there  was
    background evidence to cast doubt  on  that.   He  submitted  that  the
    appellant's suggestion that his home area is a conflict area is against
    the very specific findings in  AK  at  headnote  B(ii)  and  (iii)  and
    submitted that it was clear from AK that the appellant's home  area  is
    not a conflict zone and  the  background  evidence  submitted  was  not
    sufficient to change that finding.  He referred to the UNCHR advice and
    submitted that the criteria that the UNCHR apply is more  cautious  and
    the approach is not necessarily followed in the Tribunal.  He  referred
    to the NM and Others (Lone woman  -  Ashraf)  Somalia  CG  UKIAT  00076
    ('NM') paragraphs 108, 111, 112, 114 and 115  and  MP  &  Anor  v  SSHD
    [2014] EWCA Civ 829 ('MP') at paragraphs 4, 18, 19 and 20.

15. He submitted there is no internal armed  conflict  in  the  appellant's
    home area.  He referred to paragraph 245 of AK and  submitted  it  does
    not support he appellant's case that the route between  Kabul  and  the
    home area is not safe.  The appellant will not be removed until  he  is
    18 and will be returned to Kabul so irrespective of risks in  his  home
    area the appellant would be able to relocate to Kabul.  He referred  to
    paragraphs 212, 214, 243 and 253 of  AK  and  the  assistance  that  is
    available to returnees.  Support could be obtained from the appellant's
    home area if the appellant were returned to Kabul but that even without
    help that would not affect  relocation.  The  Refugee  Support  Network
    evidence does not take matters much further and although they may  have
    a specific view that cannot outweigh the country guidance case of AK.

16. Ms Peterson in reply submitted that the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not
    deal with the submissions made at the hearing and a simple reliance  on
    AK is not enough, the individual circumstances need  to  be  considered
    carefully. She submitted that it is not enough to rely on AK without an
    examination of the circumstances of the individual.  The  appellant  is
    young and of fighting age so therefore is at risk. She  submitted  that
    the connections between Kabul and the area is under  immense  pressure,
    she referred to the passage of 245 in AK in which it does indicate that
    in the eastern provinces travel to the  villages  is  through  enormous
    conflict.   She  submitted  that  the  judge  did  not  deal  with  the
    individual characteristics of the appellant.  When  asked  to  identify
    specific factors relied on that would put the  appellant  at  risk  she
    submitted that it was his age, that there was  no  family  support  and
    that he perceived as westernised.

Discussion

17. The judge sets out the evidence and the findings from paragraph 38:

         38.  When assessing credibility,  I  have  placed  the  appellant's
             account into the context of the situation  in  Afghanistan  as
             disclosed by the objective material.  I  have  taken  his  age
             into account.  I am  aware  that  I  should  exercise  extreme
             caution before rejecting, as  incredible,  an  account  by  an
             anxious and inexperienced  asylum  seeker  whose  reasons  for
             seeking asylum may well contain inconsistencies and omissions.
              I am mindful of the low standard of  proof  that  applies  in
             asylum cases.  I am aware that special factors apply to minors
             and that credibility has to be assessed in line with the UNCHR
             Guidelines.  I note that there should be a wider  appreciation
             of the concept of the benefit of the doubt.

18. It is clear that the judge  took  into  account  from  the  outset  the
    appellant's age, the low standard of proof and the special factors that
    apply  to  minors  when  assessing  credibility.  The  judge  set   out
    inconsistencies in the appellant's account:

         39.  However the appellant  has  been  inconsistent  in  two  major
             aspects of his story; where he was when the  Taliban  murdered
             his brother at their family home,  where  the  appellant  then
             lived, and where he was when the Taliban revisited his  family
             home two days later to threaten the appellant's life.

         40.  As regards his whereabouts at the time of his brother's murder
             outside family home, he said in his Asylum Interview Record of
             5 April 2016 that he was at the mosque.  He also said this  in
             his  adopted  witness  statement  of  30  August   2016,   and
             reiterated this at the hearing.

         41.  However in his  earlier  statement  of  5  November  2015  the
             appellant had said that he was at home at the time his brother
             was shot.  He maintains that this was an error and was due  to
             a mistake of interpretation.  However that statement is one he
             made  to  his  own  solicitors  and  it  contains  his  signed
             confirmation (respondent's bundle penultimate page)  that  the
             contents have been read back to him in Pashtun and were  true.



         42.  The appellant was about 15  years  old  at  the  date  of  his
             brother's alleged murder.  It is reasonable to expect  him  at
             that age to remember where he was when his brother  was  shot.
             This is a simple point,  and  a  fundamental  matter,  not  an
             insignificant detail.  I note also from his  Asylum  Interview
             Record of 5 April 2016 that he did not know the date  or  even
             the month of his brother's death, which I find implausible.

         43.  He has also been inconsistent about his whereabouts  when  the
             Taliban returned two days later to his home and threatened his
             life to his mother.  In his statements of 5 November 2015  and
             30 August 2016 he says that he was at the mosque and  when  he
             went home his mother took him to the uncle's  house.   However
             in his Asylum Interview Record of 5 April 2016 he says that he
             was at his uncle's house at that time and his mother  came  to
             the uncle's house to tell him what had  happened.   Again,  he
             says this is a mistake in the interpretation, although he  had
             confirmed that he had understood the interpreter at the  time.
             He did not see the letter the Taliban gave his mother.

         44.  I take into account the appellant's age at the time  of  these
             alleged events and at the dates of  making  these  statements.
             However I do not accept that these significant inconsistencies
             about his whereabouts at what should  be  two  very  memorable
             events are due to interpreter mistake;  the  mistakes  of  two
             different interpreters at two different times.   I  find  that
             these inconsistencies, combined with the  paucity  of  details
             from the appellant that what would  have  been  very  profound
             events, undermine the appellant's credibility.

         45.  It follows that I do not accept that his brother was killed or
             that he is wanted by the Taliban, who intend to  kill  him  as
             reprisal for his brother's actions.  I do not believe that  he
             is wanted by anyone in Afghanistan or that he would be at risk
             from them in his home area or in Kabul if he were returned.

19. The judge has considered the explanation  regarding  difficulties  with
    interpretation and the judge was acutely aware of the need to take into
    account the age of the appellant but even taking that into account  she
    did not accept that the inconsistencies about were due to the  mistakes
    of two different interpreters at two different  times.  She  has  given
    reasons why she reached her findings. The judge indicated at the outset
    that when assessing credibility she have placed the appellant's account
    into the context of the situation in Afghanistan as  disclosed  by  the
    objective  material.  The  approach  adopted  to  the   assessment   of
    credibility and of the evidence does not reveal an error  of  law.  The
    findings were ones that were open to the judge on the evidence.

20. I consider grounds 2 and 3 together. It  is  asserted  that  the  judge
    failed to assess risk on return in his home area  from  recruitment  by
    the Taliban and has not taken the  appellant's  personal  circumstances
    into account - his age, no male in the household  and  his  ability  to
    sustain himself without support in Kabul. With regard to risk on return
    the Tribunal sets out:

         46.  The appellant is a minor. The respondent has a duty to  minors
             and must also comply with Section 55 above.  She has said  she
             will not return  the  appellant  until  he  is  17�  or  until
             adequate reception arrangements can be made for him.

         47.  The appellant claims that he would be at risk on return as  he
             is young and without family support.  As I have stated  above,
             the CG of AK continues to  apply,  but  I  must  consider  the
             appellant's particular circumstances, including his age.

21. It is abundantly clear from the above passage that the judge was  aware
    that she was required to take the appellant's particular  circumstances
    into account. The judge with that in mind set out:

         48.  In AA the court held that:

                  "When considering the question  of  whether  children  are
                  disproportionately affected by  the  consequences  of  the
                  armed conflict in Afghanistan, a  distinction  has  to  be
                  drawn between children who were living with a  family  and
                  those who are not."

                  "Whilst we recognise that there are some  risks  to  which
                  children who will have the protection of  the  family  are
                  nevertheless subject, in particular the risk of  landmines
                  and the risk of being trafficked,  we  are  not  satisfied
                  that they are of such a level as to lead to the conclusion
                  that  all  children  would   qualify   for   international
                  protection."

             They added:

                  "The  background  evidence  demonstrates  that  unattached
                  children returned to  Afghanistan,  depending  upon  their
                  individual circumstances and the location  to  which  they
                  are returned may be exposed  to  risks  of  serious  harm,
                  inter   alia   from   indiscriminate   violence,    forced
                  recruitment, sexual violence, trafficking and  a  lack  of
                  adequate arrangements for child  protection.   Such  risks
                  will have to be taken into  account  when  addressing  the
                  question of whether  a  return  is  in  the  child's  best
                  interest, a primary consideration when determining a claim
                  to humanitarian protection."

         49.  I must consider whether the appellant would be at real risk of
             persecution.  Is he an  unattached  child  who  has  lost  all
             contact with his family, or would he have  the  protection  of
             his family on return?  When assessing  risk  I  note  that  no
             "bright line" is crossed when a child attains 18.

         50.  The respondent has not made any tracing enquiries.   She  says
             that she has insufficient resources to  do  so.   Ms  Peterson
             argues that the respondent has failed in her duty  to  try  to
             trace the appellant's relatives in Afghanistan.

         51.  The Court of Appeal's judgment in KA (Afghanistan) and Ors)  v
             SSHD (2012) EWCA Civ 1014 makes it clear that the Secretary of
             State's duty towards unaccompanied minors, in  particular  her
             duty to trace family members, is not discharged by giving them
             leave until they reach 17�.  However the court  dismissed  the
             argument that  this  systematic  breach  should  automatically
             result in a successful appeal and grant the remedy  of  either
             asylum or indefinite  leave  to  remain.   The  court  had  to
             consider the  established  facts  and  the  appellant  had  to
             establish that the failure to discharge the duty  resulted  in
             the appellant being disadvantaged, i.e.  that  family  tracing
             would  have  corroborated  a  version  of  events,  which   if
             believed,   would   have    resulted    in    a    grant    of
             asylum/humanitarian protection.  The appellant's  claim  still
             had to be determined on its merits, whether or not  any  steps
             had been taken by the respondent in discharge of  the  tracing
             obligation.

         52.   In  TN  and  MA  the  Supreme  Court   decided,   re   Afghan
             unaccompanied minors whose asylum claims were rejected,  about
             the respondent's obligations with regard  to  family  tracing.
             It was held that even a proven failure to trace did  not  give
             rise to a remedy of grant of asylum, and that if an  appellant
             felt he had been prejudiced by  the  respondent's  failure  to
             trace it was open for him to apply for an adjournment to allow
             that to be done.  No adjournment  application  has  been  made
             here.

         53.  The appellant says that he has not been in  contact  with  his
             mother, sister or uncles or aunts in Afghanistan since leaving
             there and so does not know if they are still there.   He  says
             that this is because he has no way  of  getting  in  touch  as
             there  is  no  mobile  phone  coverage  as  the  Taliban  have
             decommissioned mobile phone transmitters there to prevent them
             being used by their enemies to trace and detect them.  I  have
             no objective evidence on the state of  communications  in  the
             appellant's home area.  None has been put before me.

         54.   That  it  may  be  difficult  to  contact   his   family   is
             acknowledged, when asked if he had tried to  contact  them  by
             other means such as a letter, he questioned how  he  would  be
             able to get any message to them.  He did not suggest  that  he
             had tried other means.   I  also  note  that  before  he  left
             Afghanistan his mother gave him his Manchester cousin's mobile
             number in the UK.  That means that the appellant's  UK  cousin
             had been able to make contact with his family in that area  at
             some point, or they would not have had his cousin's UK number.
              He says that he does not know if his cousin in the UK  is  in
             contact with any relatives in Afghanistan; he has just assumed
             that the cousin is not in contact with them.  Even if  I  were
             to accept the mobile phone situation is as claimed, I find  it
             incongruous that he has not tried to contact his family by any
             other means, though he says he misses them.  I have  only  the
             appellant's  word  that  he  cannot  contact  his  family   in
             Afghanistan and I have not found his evidence to be  credible.



         55.  Even if the appellant has not been in contact with his  family
             it may be the case that the  appellant's  mother  and  sister,
             aunts and uncles still  live in  his  home  area.    There  is
             nothing to suggest that they do not.  I find  it  more  likely
             than not that his family are still there.

         56.  The appellant's mother and other relatives have supported  him
             in the past by arranging his departure.  I therefore  consider
             that they would support him again if he were returned, and  so
             the appellant does not have family support in his own area and
             it would be in his best interests to be with his  family.   He
             could also live safely in Kabul if he does not wish to  return
             to his home area.



22. The judge has  taken  into  account  the  relevant  case  law  and  has
    carefully considered the personal circumstances of the  appellant.  The
    judge found that the appellant will be able to obtain support from  his
    family. Ms Peterson did not press this aspect of the grounds of  appeal
    at the hearing. Although not relevant to error of law  (and  I  do  not
    take this into account when considering whether the judge erred on  the
    information before her) Ms Peterson advised at the commencement of  the
    hearing that the appellant has now been in touch with his  family.  The
    judge's approach was entirely consistent with  the  case  law  on  this
    issue and she has set out in considerable detail her  reasons  why  she
    found that the appellant would have support from family. With regard to
    assessment of forcible recruitment by the Taliban the judge has not set
    out a specific finding in that regard. However it  is  clear  that  the
    judge considered the risks identified  in  AA   that  an  unaccompanied
    child 'may be exposed  to  risks  of  serious  harm,  inter  alia  from
    indiscriminate   violence,   forced   recruitment,   sexual   violence,
    trafficking and a lack of adequate arrangements for child  protection'.
    It was specifically in relation to the 2 paragraphs from AA set out  by
    the judge that she considered whether the appellant would  be  at  real
    risk of persecution. This must encompass all the likely risks  but  the
    judge is not required to identify all the individual risks.


23. The appellant has relied on passages from AA and the  UNHCR  report  of
    July 2012. Whilst the  UNHCR  offers  valuable  insights  I  accept  Mr
    Tufan's submission that the criteria  that  the  UNCHR  apply  is  more
    cautious and the approach is not necessarily followed in the  Tribunal.
    - see for example MP & Anor v  SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  829  ('MP')  at
    paragraphs 18, 19 and 20.  The passages referred to concerning forcible
    recruitment from AA by the appellant are from the  evidence  considered
    by the Upper Tribunal.  The  general  conclusions  drew  a  distinction
    between children with family and unaccompanied  children.  The  general
    conclusions as set out in the headnote are:


         1) The evidence before the Tribunal does not alter the position  as
         described in HK and Others  (minors  -  indiscriminate  violence  -
         forced recruitment  by  Taliban  -  contact  with  family  members)
         Afghanistan CG [2010] UKUT 378 (IAC), namely that when  considering
         the question of whether children are disproportionately affected by
         the  consequences  of  the  armed  conflict   in   Afghanistan,   a
         distinction has to be drawn between children who were living with a
         family and those who are not. That distinction has been  reinforced
         by the additional material  before  this  Tribunal.  Whilst  it  is
         recognised that there are some risks to  which  children  who  will
         have the protection of the  family  are  nevertheless  subject,  in
         particular the risk of landmines and the risks of being trafficked,
         they are not of such a level as to lead to the conclusion that  all
         children would qualify for international protection. In arriving at
         this conclusion, account has been taken of the  necessity  to  have
         regard to the best interests of children.

         (2) However, the background evidence demonstrates  that  unattached
         children returned to Afghanistan, depending upon  their  individual
         circumstances and the location to which they are returned,  may  be
         exposed to risk of serious harm,  inter  alia  from  indiscriminate
         violence, forced recruitment, sexual violence,  trafficking  and  a
         lack of adequate arrangements for child protection. Such risks will
         have to be taken into  account  when  addressing  the  question  of
         whether a return is  in  the  child's  best  interests,  a  primary
         consideration when determining a claim to humanitarian protection.

24. The judge found that the  appellant  has  the  support  of  his  family
    including aunts and uncles. He would not be returning without  support.
    No individual frailties were identified that would make  the  appellant
    particularly vulnerable to forced recruitment by the Taliban.

25. Ms Peterson argued that the appellant cannot travel between  Kabul  and
    his home area and his family could  not  offer  him  support  in  Kabul
    because this was a conflict zone. It was asserted that  the  judge  had
    failed to consider the personal circumstances  of  the  appellant  when
    considering relocation to Kabul. The judge when considering the risk to
    civilians set out:

         57.  In AK the Tribunal held that whilst, when assessing a claim in
             the context of Article 15(c) in which the  respondent  asserts
             that  Kabul  city  would  be  a  viable  internal   relocation
             alternative, it is necessary to take  into  account  (both  in
             assessing "safety" and "reasonableness") not only the level of
             violence in that city but also the difficulties experienced by
             that city's poor  and  also  the  manly  Internally  Displaced
             Persons (IDPs) living there, these considerations will not  in
             general make Kabul unsafe or unreasonable.

26. She then  went  on  to  consider  the  personal  circumstances  of  the
    appellant:

         58.  The appellant will not be returned until he is  17�  or  there
             are adequate reception arrangements for him.  I  believe  that
             he would have family help even if he relocated to Kabul.  I do
             not think that there would be any individual risk to him.   He
             has shown himself to be resourceful in travelling to the UK as
             he did.  He  is  fit  and  well.   He  has  received  some  UK
             education and can speak some English, and should  be  able  to
             sustain himself in his home country.  The appellant  has  been
             in  the  UK  for  only  about  one  year.   His  cultural  and
             linguistic ties are in Afghanistan.  I do  take  into  account
             that he is getting help and guidance in the UK and he may  not
             get the level of help he gets here in Afghanistan.  However he
             would not be returned without help.

27. Regarding the argument that the appellant could not travel  from  Kabul
    to his home area it is not evident that this particular submission  was
    made to the First-tier Tribunal and it does not appear in  the  grounds
    of appeal. However, in any event I accept Mr  Tufan's  submission  that
    this argument is not supported by the conclusions in AK as set  out  at
    in the headnote at B:

         ...

         (ii) Despite a rise in the number of civilian deaths and casualties
         and (particularly in the 2010-2011  period)  an  expansion  of  the
         geographical scope of the armed conflict in Afghanistan, the  level
         of indiscriminate violence in that country taken as a whole is  not
         at such a high level as to mean that, within the meaning of Article
         15(c) of the Qualification Directive, a civilian, solely  by  being
         present in the country, faces a real risk which threatens his  life
         or person.

         (iii) Nor is the level of  indiscriminate  violence,  even  in  the
         provinces worst affected by the violence (which may now be taken to
         include Ghazni but not to include Kabul), at such a level...

28. For the reasons set out above there was no material error of law in the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed. The decision of the respondent stands.
