                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellants appealed against the decision of Judge Birk of the First-
    tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on 20th March 2015.

 2. The Appellants are Indian citizens, and  the  First  Appellant  is  the
    mother of the remaining Appellants.

 3. The Appellants arrived in  the  United  Kingdom  on  4th  May  2012  as
    dependants of Satpal Satpal (the Sponsor), the  husband  of  the  First
    Appellant, and the father of the remaining Appellants.

 4. The Appellants had leave until 14th June 2014, and on  12th  June  2014
    applied for indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

 5. The applications were  refused  on  18th  November  2014  on  financial
    grounds.  The Respondent referred to paragraph 287(a)(v) in relation to
    the First Appellant, and paragraph 298(v) in relation to the  remaining
    Appellants.  The Respondent did not accept that the Appellants would be
    able to maintain themselves adequately.  The relevant assessment was to
    compare the income of the  Appellants  with  an  equivalent  family  in
    receipt  of  income  support.   The  Respondent  contended   that   the
    Appellants' income fell �74.29 per  week  below  what  a  family  would
    receive by way of benefits.

 6. The appeals were heard together by the FtT on 10th March 2015.  The FtT
    refused an adjournment request which had been made  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellants, on the basis that they had made an application for  working
    tax credit and child tax credit which they were  entitled  to  receive,
    and this income could be  taken  into  account,  and  would  mean  that
    adequate maintenance would be available.  It was accepted  at  the  FtT
    hearing that the shortfall without the working and child tax credit was
    �55.23 per week.

 7. The FtT refused the adjournment request and proceeded  to  dismiss  the
    appeals under the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.

 8. The Appellants applied for and were granted permission to appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal contending that  the  FtT  had  erred  in  refusing  the
    adjournment request.

Error of Law

 9. At a hearing on 7th March 2016 I heard submissions  from  both  parties
    regarding error of law.  The Respondent did not accept that the FtT had
    erred in refusing the adjournment application.   Full  details  of  the
    application for permission, the grant of  permission,  the  submissions
    made by both parties, and my reasons for setting aside the decision  of
    the FtT are set out in my decision dated 7th March 2016 promulgated  on
    22nd March 2016.  I set out below paragraphs 15-23  of  that  decision,
    which contain my conclusions and reasons  for  setting  aside  the  FtT
    decision:

         "15. The FtT recognised that the appropriate Procedure Rules to  be
             considered are rules 2 and 4 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-
             tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum  Chamber)  Rules  2014,
             and that Nwaigwe gives guidance on the issues to be considered
             when an adjournment is requested.

           16.    Nwaigwe makes  it  clear  that  when  considering  an  FtT
             decision to refuse an adjournment, the question for the  Upper
             Tribunal is not whether the FtT acted reasonably, but the test
             to be applied is that of fairness, and whether there  was  any
             deprivation of the affected party's right to a fair hearing.

            17.     The  issue  before  the  FtT  related  to  adequacy   of
             maintenance.  This was the only reason  that  the  application
             had been refused under the Immigration Rules.

           18.    The Appellants' case was that they had, belatedly, made an
             application for tax credits, to which they were entitled,  and
             the award of  those  tax  credits  would  mean  that  adequate
             maintenance would be available.

           19.    Although it could not be  said  with  certainty  when  the
             application  for  tax  credits  would   be   considered,   the
             Appellants were not asking for an open ended adjournment,  but
             requested an adjournment of between four and six  weeks.   The
             FtT was told that the application for tax credits was made  in
             mid-January (although the letter from  HMRC  dated  3rd  April
             2015 awarding tax credits from 22nd February 2015 to 5th April
             2015, indicates that the claim was only received on 25th March
             2015).  The FtT was not given any satisfactory  reason  as  to
             why the Appellants had left it so late to claim  tax  credits,
             taking into account that the application for indefinite  leave
             to remain was made on 12th June  2014,  and  refused  on  18th
             November 2014.

           20.    It is certainly at least arguable,  that  the  application
             for tax credits should have been made far earlier than it was.



           21.    However, the issue under the Immigration Rules related  to
             adequacy of maintenance, and the adjournment  application  was
             made on the basis that if the case proceeded,  the  Appellants
             could not satisfy the Immigration Rules.   Therefore  the  FtT
             needed  to  leave  aside  whether  the  Appellants  had  acted
             reasonably or not, and concentrate on whether there could be a
             fair hearing to decide adequacy of maintenance in the  absence
             of the Appellants having evidence to prove  their  entitlement
             to tax credits.

           22.    My conclusion is that the Appellants could not have a fair
             hearing on adequacy of maintenance under the Immigration Rules
             without being given the opportunity to provide  evidence  that
             they were entitled to tax credits.

           23.    I therefore conclude that the FtT erred in law in refusing
             the adjournment application.   The  decision  of  the  FtT  is
             therefore set aside."

10. The hearing was adjourned to enable the Upper Tribunal to  re-make  the
    decision, as it was not clear that a supplementary bundle of  documents
    provided by the Appellants, had been served upon the Respondent.

Re-making the Decision

11. At the hearing on 5th July 2016 Mr Mills, on behalf of the  Respondent,
    conceded that the appeals  should  be  allowed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.  It was accepted that because of the award of tax  credits,  the
    Appellants could be adequately maintained without  recourse  to  public
    funds.  The income that they received exceeded what would  be  received
    by an equivalent family in receipt of benefits.

12. In my view the concession was rightly made and I therefore allowed  the
    appeal on the basis that paragraph 287(a)(v) was satisfied in  relation
    to the First Appellant, and paragraph 298(v) was satisfied in  relation
    to the remaining Appellants.

13. As the appeals are allowed under  the  Immigration  Rules,  it  is  not
    necessary to go  on  and  consider  Article  8  of  the  1950  European
    Convention on Human Rights.

Notice of Decision

The appeals are allowed under the Immigration Rules.

An anonymity order is not made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeals I have decided whether  to  make  fee  awards.
It is clear that at the time of the Respondent's  decision,  the  Appellants
could not satisfy the Immigration Rules.   The  appeals  have  been  allowed
because of evidence submitted after  the  decision  to  refuse.   There  are
therefore no fee awards.
