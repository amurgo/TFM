It is most unwise for a judge  to  conduct  post-hearing  research,  on  the
internet or otherwise, into the factual issues which have to be  decided  in
a case.  To derive evidence from post-hearing research on the  internet  and
to base  conclusions  on  that  evidence  without  giving  the  parties  the
opportunity to comment on it is wrong.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    This is a reconsideration of an appeal by the appellant, a citizen  of
    Nigeria, born on 10 October  1976.   The  respondent  has  refused  the
    appellant leave to enter the United Kingdom as a student in a  decision
    issued on 6 February 2007.

2.    This appeal was first heard before Immigration Judge Hart, who,  in  a
    determination promulgated  on  24  July  2007,  dismissed  the  appeal.
    Reconsideration  was  ordered  by  a  senior  immigration  judge,   who
    considered it arguable that there may have been two errors of law  made
    in the  determination.   First,  the  immigration  judge  searched  the
    internet for information about the appellant's degree course after  the
    hearing and did not give either party the opportunity to comment on the
    results of his research.  Second, it was suggested the findings on  the
    financial  aspects  of  the  claim  might  be  wrong  in  law,  as  the
    possibility of student fees being paid by instalments had been ignored.

Post-hearing research

3.    In  this  case,  the  immigration  judge  searched  the  internet  for
    information  about  the  appellant's  proposed  course  provider.    He
    ascertained that  the  relevant  college  was  associated  with  London
    Metropolitan University, and that the University awards banking degrees
    after a three-year, full-time course.  The only details provided by the
    appellant about the course he proposed to take at his  course  provider
    were that it ran  for  about  ten  months  to  December  2007,  with  a
    requirement  for  a  dissertation  in  March  2008.   The  judge   then
    contrasted this information against the  information  relating  to  the
    three-year course  provided  by  London  Metropolitan  University.   He
    concluded that he did not find it credible that the applicant "would be
    able to complete his studies for  a  degree  within  the  brief  period
    suggested by the college".

4.    The immigration judiciary, when deciding individual cases,  will  have
    close regard to the information and submissions  put  forward  by  both
    parties in writing prior to the appeal,  and  to  the  submissions  and
    evidence heard at the appeal.  They will also need to consider  and  be
    guided by the legislation, Immigration Rules and any case law that  may
    be relevant to the individual case.  Any judge will have regard to  the
    evidence and the law during preparation,  pre-hearing  and  during  the
    hearing itself.  Where a written determination is to be produced  after
    the hearing, it will generally be necessary to  give  further  detailed
    consideration to the evidence and submissions made to the judge and  to
    the law applicable to the case.

5.    It is, however, most  unwise  for  a  judge  to  conduct  post-hearing
    research, on the internet or otherwise, into the factual  issues  which
    have to be decided in a case.  Decisions on factual  issues  should  be
    made on the basis of the evidence presented on behalf  of  the  parties
    and such additional evidence as the  parties  are  aware  of  as  being
    before the judge.  To conduct post-hearing research on the internet and
    to base conclusions on that research without  giving  the  parties  the
    opportunity to comment on it is wrong.  If such research is  conducted,
    and this determination gives absolutely  no  encouragement  to  such  a
    process, where an immigration judge considers the research may or  will
    affect the decision to be reached, then it will be the judge's duty  to
    reconvene the hearing and supply copies to the parties, in  order  that
    the parties can be invited to make such submissions as they might  have
    on it.

6.    Here we conclude the immigration judge was wrong  in  law  to  conduct
    research on the internet in the manner in which degrees are awarded  by
    the London Metropolitan University  and/or  the  proposed  college  the
    appellant intended to attend.  The result of the research  was  adverse
    to the  appellant's  claim  and  clearly  had  some  influence  on  the
    immigration judge's assessment of the course the appellant proposed  to
    follow.  For the reasons given below, however, we do not  consider  the
    error was a material error of law.

Finance

7.    Rule 57(vi) Immigration Rules (HC395 as amended) provides as follows:

       "57. The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave  to  enter
             the United Kingdom as a student are that he...

       (vi)      is able to meet the costs of his course and  accommodation
             and the maintenance  of  himself  and  any  dependants  without
             taking employment or engaging in business or having recourse to
             public funds."

    Both the entry clearance officer and the  immigration  judge  concluded
    that the appellant did not satisfy this requirement.  We agree for  the
    reasons fully set out in the otherwise comprehensive and clear decision
    of the immigration judge.

8.    In particular, it is apparent that the  appellant  needed  finance  of
    over �8,000 to fund one year of his course in the UK.  He had paid some
    �1,200 towards the �3,000 of fees which comprised part of  the  overall
    figure.  It was suggested that the immigration judge had been wrong  in
    law to disregard the fact that the balance of  the  monies  might  have
    been paid by the appellant's sponsor by instalments.

9.    The immigration judge in fact analysed the financial  evidence  before
    him very clearly.  All the evidence showed was that the sponsor  had  a
    reasonably substantial cash flow through his various business accounts.
     The profit shown on one profit and loss account was so small as to  be
    properly wholly disregarded.  The judge concluded  that  "The  accounts
    give no confidence that the appellant can withdraw  from  that  account
    under the control of his uncle a sum of the order of 1.8 million  naira
    without leaving those accounts  overdrawn  or  the  company  bereft  of
    working capital".  He also said "There is in fact no evidence that  the
    required sums can be made available  by  his  uncle  from  the  company
    profits over and above his own financial needs".  The appellant  failed
    to adduce evidence showing the full income,  outgoings,  and  the  full
    assets and liabilities of the sponsor with  details  of  the  sponsor's
    dependants (if any) and thereby failed to prove that the sponsor was in
    a position to sponsor him.

10.   The judge  reached  the  wholly  understandable  conclusion  that  the
    appellant had not met the  financial  requirements  of  the  Rules  and
    explained why in full detail.  Accordingly, the fact that an  error  of
    law was  made  by  the  immigration  judge  carrying  out  post-hearing
    internet research was  not  material,  since  the  appellant  does  not
    otherwise satisfy the requirements of Rule 57 (vi).

Decision

11.   The decision of the immigration judge to dismiss this appeal stands.

                                                                   PRESIDENT
