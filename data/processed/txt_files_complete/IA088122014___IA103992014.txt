Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   No representative and no appearance


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against a  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  (Judge  Archer)  allowing  the  appellants'  appeals  against
    refusals to grant  AV  leave  as  a  Tier  2  (General)  Migrant  under
    paragraph 245HD of the Immigration Rules (HC 395) as  amended  and  DKP
    (her husband) leave as her dependant.

 2. For convenience, I will refer to the parties as  they  appeared  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

Background

 3. The appellants are citizens of India who were born  respectively  on  2
    May 1983 and 19 May 1982.  The first appellant  was  granted  leave  to
    enter the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student on 22  September
    2010 valid until 19 January 2012.  On 26 January 2012, she was  granted
    further leave to remain as a  Tier  1  (Post-Study)  Migrant  until  26
    January 2014.

 4. The second appellant entered the UK on 20 February 2010 and was granted
    leave to enter as a Tier 4 (General) Student until  24  December  2014.
    On 1 March 2012, he was granted further leave as the dependant  of  the
    first appellant who, by that time, had leave as a Tier  1  (Post-Study)
    Migrant.  That leave was valid until 26 January 2014.

 5. On 22 January 2014, the first appellant applied for further leave as  a
    Tier 2 (General) Migrant and the second appellant applied  for  further
    leave as her dependant.  The first appellant is a nurse.

 6. On 31 January 2014, the Secretary of State refused those  applications.
    The Secretary of State also  made  decisions  to  remove  each  of  the
    appellants by way of directions under s.47 of the  Immigration,  Asylum
    and Nationality Act 2006.

 7. The basis of the refusal to grant the first appellant  leave  was  that
    the Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) stated that the first  appellant's
    salary would be �16,200 whilst para 79A of Appendix A requires a salary
    of "not less than �20,300".  As a consequence, the Secretary  of  State
    did not award the first appellant the required 20 points for having the
    "appropriate salary" and the appellants failed under the Rules.

The First-tier Tribunal's Decision

 8. The appellant's appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    dated 10 September 2014, Judge Archer allowed the  appellants'  appeals
    to the extent that the decision to refuse the first appellant leave was
    not in accordance with the law.  Judge Archer seems  to  have  accepted
    that the first appellant could not meet the requirements of  the  Rules
    in respect of the CoS showing the  "appropriate  salary"  of  at  least
    �20,300.  Nevertheless, apparently in response to a submission made  by
    the appellants that the  "evidential  flexibility"  provision  in  para
    245AA of the Rules applied, he allowed the appeals on  the  basis  that
    the sponsor should have been given an opportunity to submit a  "Sponsor
    Note"  stating  (as  seems  to  have  been  accepted)  that  the  first
    appellant's salary  would  rise  to  �20,300  when  she  achieved  full
    registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Council when she  would  be
    paid at Band 5 rather than, as at present, Band 3.

 9. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the basis that the first appellant could  not  comply  with
    the requirements of para 79A(b) of Appendix  A  because,  although  her
    salary was less than �20,300 at present, the CoS did not state that she
    would  continue  to  be  sponsored  as  a  nurse  and  after  achieving
    registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Council her salary would be
    not less than �20,300.   The  grounds  argue  that  the  appeal  ought,
    therefore, to have been dismissed.

10. On 20 October 2014, the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Warren  L  Grant)
    granted the Secretary of State permission to  appeal  on  that  ground.
    Thus, the appeal came before me.

The Hearing

11. The appeals were listed  at  2pm  on  21  January  2015.   Neither  the
    appellants nor their legal representatives, Law  &  Lawyers  Solicitors
    attended.  The Tribunal staff contacted the appellants' representatives
    by telephone.  The  representatives  informed  the  Tribunal  that  the
    appellants would not be  attending  and  they  had  been  told  by  the
    appellants not to attend.

12. Mr Richards, who represented the Secretary  of  State,  invited  me  to
    determine the appeal in the absence of the appellants.  I was satisfied
    that the appellants and their  legal  representatives  had  been  given
    notice of the hearing and, in the light of the fact that the appellants
    did not wish to attend, I exercised my discretion under rule 38 of  the
    Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  (SI  2008/2698  as
    amended) to hear the appeals in the absence of the  appellants  in  the
    interests of justice.

The Submissions

13. On behalf of the respondent,  Mr  Richards  submitted  that  the  first
    appellant could not succeed under the Immigration Rules as the CoS  did
    not show that she had a salary of at least �20,300 as required by  para
    79A.  Further, the CoS did not state in accordance with para 79A(b), by
    way of exception to that requirement,  that  the  first  appellant  was
    being sponsored as a nurse and would continue  to  be  sponsored  as  a
    nurse after achieving Nursing and Midwifery Council registration with a
    salary of not less than �20,300 once that registration was achieved.

14. Further,  Mr  Richards  submitted  that  the  "evidential  flexibility"
    provisions in para 245AA did not apply.  In  particular,  he  submitted
    that it could not be said that there was any missing information in the
    CoS.

15. Consequently, he invited me to conclude that the judge had erred in law
    in allowing the appellants' appeals as not being in accordance with the
    law.

Discussion

16. The relevant provisions in the Immigration Rules  are  in  Appendix  A.
    Para 70 states that:

         "The points awarded for appropriate salary will  be  based  on  the
         applicant's gross annual salary to be paid by the Sponsor ...".

17. Para 79A states that:

         "No points will be awarded if the salary referred to  in  paragraph
         79 above is less than �20,300 per year, unless: ...

         (b)  the Certificate of Sponsorship checking service entry  records
             the applicant is being sponsored as a nurse or  midwife,  will
             continue to be sponsored as a nurse or midwife by the  Sponsor
             after achieving Nursing and  Midwifery  Council  registration,
             and a salary will be not less than �20,300 per year once  that
             registration is achieved."

18. I have set out the relevant provisions as in force at the date  of  the
    Secretary of State's decisions on 31 January 2014.  The provisions have
    since been amended in particular to increase the salary threshold  from
    �20,300 to �20,500.

19. There is no doubt that the first  appellant's  CoS  did  not  meet  the
    "appropriate salary" requirement in para 79A.  It stated a gross salary
    of �16,200 and did not  record  that  the  first  appellant  was  being
    sponsored as a nurse and would following registration be employed at  a
    salary of not less than �20,300.

20. The CoS states that the first appellant's "job  title"  is  "a  BAND  3
    NURSE" and "job type" is "2231 Nurses".  Under the heading "Summary  of
    Job Description" the CoS states:

         "Assess, planned implement care for residents.  Evaluate care given
         to  residents.   Undertake  simple   dressings   and   observations
         supervised by the registered nurse.  Manage and supervise carers on
         a daily basis and ensuring work is delegated and completed.  Assist
         with induction, appraisal and supervision of junior staff.   Assist
         registered nurses with any medical  emergencies  within  the  home.
         Liaise with external health professions  and  relative,  administer
         medication, supervised by the registered nurse.  Obtain  IELTs  and
         PR Number of NNC to enable progression onto the ON Programme."  (my
         emphasis)

21. There, as will be seen,  reference  is  made  to  the  first  appellant
    obtaining a registration with the Nursing  and  Midwifery  Council  and
    progressing onto the Overseas Nursing Programme.  It  appears  to  have
    been accepted before the judge  that  the  first  appellant  would,  on
    registration, be paid at least �20,300.  However, since  this  was  not
    stated in the CoS, the first appellant could not meet the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules and the judge was correct  not  to  allow  her
    appeal (and that of the second appellant as her dependant) on the basis
    that they had, in fact, met the requirements of the Rules.

22. The Secretary of State's grounds of appeal appear to have been  drafted
    on the basis that the Judge was satisfied that the first appellant  did
    in fact meet the requirements of Appendix A.  That was not his finding.
     The judge's decision appears to be based rather upon an application of
    para 245AA of the Rules.

23. That provision provides, so far as relevant to this appeal as follows:

         "(a) where Part 6A of any Appendices referred to in Part  6A  state
             that specified documents must be provided, the Entry Clearance
             Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary  of  State  will
             only consider documents that  have  been  submitted  with  the
             application and will only consider documents  submitted  after
             the application where they are submitted  in  accordance  with
             sub-paragraph (b).

         (b)  If the applicant has submitted specified documents in which:

             (i)  some of the documents in a  sequence  have  been  omitted
                  (for example, if one  bank  statement  from  a  series  is
                  missing); and

             (ii) a document is in the wrong  format  (for  example,  if  a
                  letter is not on letter head paper as specified); or

             (iii)    a document is a copy and not an original document; or

             (iv)  a  document  does  not  contain  all  of  the  specified
                  information;

             The  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  Immigration  Officer  or  the
             Secretary  of  State  may  contact  the   applicant   or   his
             representative in writing, and request the correct  documents.
             The requested  documents  must  be  received  at  the  address
             specified in the request within seven working days of the date
             of the request.

         (c)  Documents will not be requested where a specified document has
             not  been  submitted  (for   example   an   English   language
             certificate is missing), or where the Entry Clearance Officer,
             Immigration  Officer  or  the  Secretary  of  State  does  not
             anticipate that addressing the omission or error  referred  to
             in sub-para (b) will lead to a grant because  the  application
             will be refused for other reasons.  ..."

24. In allowing the appeal on the basis that  the  decisions  were  not  in
    accordance with the law, Judge Archer gave  the  following  reasons  at
    para 21:

         "The difficulty for the respondent is that the reasons for  refusal
         letter states that the salary does not meet the required  threshold
         under Appendix A.  That is not consistent with the oral submissions
         made by Mr Hibbs and is plainly not correct - the COS simply stated
         the current pre-registration salary.  The respondent would have had
         a stronger case if the wording of the refusal  letter  had  matched
         the oral submissions made by Mr Hibbs.  However, it does not do  so
         and the respondent has failed to make a lawful decision.  No  valid
         decision has yet been made in respect of this application."

25. The submissions of Mr Hibbs (who  then  represented  the  Secretary  of
    State) are summarised at para 18 of the judge's decision as follows:

         "Mr Hibbs submitted that the salary must be not less  than  �20,300
         once registration is achieved and that information must be  in  the
         COS.  The Rules are clear, there is no  evidence  that  the  salary
         will rise to �20,300.  The submitted COS is not a blank document in
         terms of salary - the figure is clear."

26. I confess to some difficulty in understanding Judge Archer's  reasoning
    in para 21 responding to the (then)  Presenting  Officer's  submissions
    made on behalf of the respondent.  That submission appears to have been
    that as the CoS was not a "blank document in terms of salary" there was
    no missing information.

27. Judge Archer does not set out para 245AA to which he  was  referred  by
    the appellants'  legal  representative  and  in  para  21  I  can  only
    speculate that Judge Archer considered that the failure to include  the
    information falling within para 79A(b) of Appendix A in  the  CoS  fell
    within the wording of para 245AA(b)(iv) namely that the  CoS  did  "not
    contain all of the specified information".

28. With respect to Judge Archer  the  CoS  did  set  out  the  information
    required by paras 79 and 79A namely the first appellant's "gross annual
    salary".  That would appear to have been the point being  made  by  the
    (then) Presenting Officer that the CoS was "not  a  blank  document  in
    terms  of  salary".   It  clearly  was  not.   In  my  judgment,   para
    245AA(b)(iv) is not engaged in the circumstances  where  (assuming  the
    CoS is a specified document for the purpose of  para  245AA)  a  salary
    figure is included.  That is the required information.  Had the  salary
    entry been left blank then the CoS would have failed to contain all the
    required information.  What, in  effect,  occurred  here  is  that  the
    information provided was not wholly accurate.  It reflected the present
    salary but not future salary of the first appellant.  To  that  extent,
    its inaccuracy was equivalent to a CoS which contained a  wrong  salary
    figure.  Para 245AA(b)(iv) would not apply in the latter situation and,
    in my judgment, it does not apply in the former situation either.  Para
    245AA(b)(iv) applies, in my judgment, where a document fails to contain
    "specified information" which in its absence would necessarily lead  to
    the application being dismissed as a relevant piece of information  has
    been missed out from the document.  Here, relevant information has been
    provided albeit not sufficient to meet the requirements of para 79A  of
    Appendix A.

29. For these reasons, Judge Archer erred in law in allowing the appeals on
    the basis that the respondent's decision to refuse  leave  was  not  in
    accordance with the law.

30. That said, it was clearly accepted before  the  judge  that,  with  the
    proper documentation, the first appellant would meet  the  requirements
    of the Rules.  If, in fact, that is indeed the  case  then  it  remains
    open to the appellants to seek to persuade the Secretary of State  that
    they can in fact meet the requirements of the Rules.

31. The appellants did not rely upon Article 8 in the grounds of appeal  to
    the First-tier Tribunal nor was it relied  upon  at  the  hearing.   In
    those circumstances, there is no  basis  for  considering  whether  the
    respondent's decisions breach Article 8.  No material  was  put  before
    the First-tier Tribunal and, in the absence of the appellants and their
    legal representatives before me, nothing further was relied upon.

Decision

32. For the above reasons, the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in allowing
    the appellants' appeals on the ground that the  respondent's  decisions
    were not in accordance with the law.  Those decisions are set aside.

33. I remake the decisions dismissing the  appellants'  appeals  under  the
    Immigration Rules.
