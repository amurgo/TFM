Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Z Khan, Londonium Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Ahmed, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh born on 8 February 1981.   He
    made an application for a residence card based on his  marriage  to  an
    EEA  national  Sponsor,  Marie-Louise  Bertin,  a  French  national  of
    Filipina origin.  This application was refused by the Respondent  in  a
    decision dated 29 April  2015  following  an  application  made  on  18
    November 2014.  The Respondent did not accept  having  interviewed  the
    Appellant and Sponsor on 20 April 2015 that the  marriage  was  genuine
    and it was asserted that pursuant to Regulation 2  of  the  Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations 2006 it was a marriage of convenience.

 2. The Appellant appealed and his appeal came before  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Mailer for hearing on 12 July 2016.  It was then adjourned  part-
    heard until 8 September 2016 on the basis that  the  Sponsor  had  some
    difficulty understanding the questions and a  Tagalog  interpreter  was
    requested for the adjourned hearing.

 3. In a Decision and Reasons promulgated on 1  November  2016,  the  Judge
    dismissed the appeal on the basis that he did not find the  Appellant's
    evidence to be credible  and  he  concluded  that  the  Respondent  had
    discharged  the  burden  of  proving  that  the  marriage  was  one  of
    convenience.

 4. An application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  made
    on 14 November  2016.   The  grounds  in  support  of  the  application
    submitted that the judge's decision was vitiated by material errors  of
    law on the grounds of procedural irregularity  and  unfairness  as  the
    Respondent failed to disclose material documents and  evidence,  namely
    the interviewer comments, cf. Miah (interviewer's comments: disclosure:
    fairness) [2014] UKUT 00515 (IAC).

 5. Permission to appeal was granted in respect of that  ground  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Andrew on 6 April 2017.

         Hearing

 6. At the hearing before me, Ms Ahmed on behalf of the Secretary of State,
    indicated that the interviewer's comments which are otherwise known  as
    the form ICV.4605 had been prepared in respect of this case but had not
    in fact been served and in light of that omission she conceded that the
    appeal hearing had been procedurally unfair.  Ms Ahmed served a copy of
    the ICV.4605 on both the Upper Tribunal and on Mr Khan representing the
    Appellant and the Sponsor.

 7. In light of Ms Ahmed's helpful concession  I  find  that  the  decision
    promulgated on 1 November 2016 is vitiated by  error  of  law  viz  the
    absence of form ICV.4605 in light of the decision in Miah (op. cit.).

Notice of Decision

I remit the appeal for a hearing de novo before the First-tier Tribunal.

I make no anonymity order.

Standard directions apply.
