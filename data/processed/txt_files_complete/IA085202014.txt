Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Ghana.  She was born on  15  March  1962.
    She appealed against the appellant's refusal to grant her  a  residence
    card as the primary carer of a British citizen residing here  dated  30
    January 2014.

 2. The  appeal  was  dismissed  by  Judge  A  W  Khan  (the  judge)  in  a
    determination promulgated on 2 September 2014.

 3. The judge found that Regulation 15A(7) was  relevant  as  there  was  a
    shared responsibility for the child between both the appellant and  the
    child's father.

 4. The judge went on to find that as the child's father  was  British  and
    therefore an exempt  person,  the  appellant  was  not  entitled  to  a
    derivative right of  residence  under  Regulation  15A(7)(b)(ii).   The
    appellant's son would not in any event be forced to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom as he was British and there was someone  else  who  could  look
    after him, that is, his father.

 5. The grounds claim the judge misunderstood the  facts,  failed  to  make
    findings on material witness evidence, carried out a flawed  assessment
    of the issue of primary care under Regulation 15A,  failed  to  provide
    adequate reasons for a finding on a  material  matter,  made  a  flawed
    assessment of where the best interests of the child lay  and  erred  by
    failing to consider the appellant's entitlement under  Section  R-LTRPT
    of Appendix FM.

 6. Judge Saffer in a decision dated 14 October 2014, refused permission to
    appeal.   He  found  the  grounds  amounted  to  nothing  more  than  a
    disagreement with facts the judge  was  entitled  to  come  to  on  the
    evidence.  In any event, there was no notice of decision requiring  the
    appellant to leave the United Kingdom such as to engage Article 8.

 7. When the  grounds  were  resubmitted,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  McGeachy
    granted permission to appeal on 24 January 2015.  He had this to say:

         "The grounds of appeal assert that as the appellant is  the  mother
         of a British child she is entitled to remain as the carer of an EEA
         national and that the judge had erred in concluding  that  she  was
         not the primary carer.  Moreover, they assert that the Judge of the
         First-tier Tribunal erred in his assessment of the  rights  of  the
         appellant under Article 8 of the ECHR.

         Given that the appellant's son is 13 and that he  is,  it  appears,
         living  with  her  I  consider  that  the  grounds  of  appeal  are
         arguable."

 8. Thus the matter came before me.

Submissions on Error of Law

 9. Ms Noulett submitted that there was no issue that the appellant and her
    son Tyrone lived together.  That had been  accepted  by  the  judge  at
    [11], [26] and [27] of the decision.

10. She claimed that the judge erred at [18] of  the  decision  in  finding
    that Tyrone obtained British citizenship by  registration  due  to  his
    father's British nationality and my attention was drawn  to  pages  10,
    120 and 127 of the appellant's bundle which indicated that the basis of
    his citizenship was that he was born here and had lived here in  excess
    of ten years. It was true that Tyrone's  father  made  an  unsuccessful
    application on his behalf which the judge referred to at  [12]  of  the
    decision although he erred when he  said  Tyrone  was  granted  British
    citizenship on 13 November 2001; that was Tyrone's date of  birth.   He
    was granted British citizenship on 21 June 2012.

11. Ms Noulett submitted that the judge's errors of fact  I  have  set  out
    above adversely affected his findings such that he erred  in  terms  of
    who had primary care of Tyrone.  The judge set out at [13]  inter  alia
    "the documentary evidence thus far would appear to  indicate  that  the
    appellant does not have the primary care of her son ......".   At  [16]
    the judge said he  found  that  there  was  shared  responsibility  for
    Tyrone.  Ms Noulett's argument was that  the  judge's  errors  of  fact
    contributed to his finding of shared responsibility at [16].   Further,
    there was no analysis as to the  extent  of  shared  responsibility  in
    terms of the respondent's guidance "Derivative Rights  of  Residence  -
    Ruiz Zambrano cases dated 12 December 2012, Issue No. 21/2012".

12. Ms Noulett drew my attention to [16] and [18] of the guidance.  It  was
    not disputed that Tyrone lived with the appellant who  made  day-to-day
    decisions for him.  There was no finding by the judge  as  to  who  had
    financial responsibility for Tyrone although there  was  evidence  that
    his father provided him with ï¿½5 pocket money weekly. The judge found at
    [20] that Tyrone's father could look after him in the  event  that  the
    appellant returned to her own country, however, the judge  carried  out
    no adequate analysis to reach that decision.

13. Ms Noulett submitted that the judge erred in failing to  determine  the
    appellant's appeal under R-LTRPT of Appendix FM on the sole basis  that
    the  appellant  had  not  made  a  valid  application  under  the   new
    Immigration  Rules.   The  judge  found  at  [25]  that  the  appellant
    "......must have made a valid application for limited leave  to  remain
    as a parent which she did not". That was an error.   My  attention  was
    drawn to Ahmed (Amos; Zambrano; reg 15A(3)(c) [2006] EEA  Regs)  [2013]
    UKUT 00089 (IAC) at [80].  In that case the panel  accepted  that  they
    were entitled to deal with Article 8 in such an appeal  with  reference
    to JM(Liberia) [2006] EWCA Civ 1402 principles.  They took into account
    that the appellant in Ahmed met all the relevant material (the  panel's
    emphasis) requirements of the new Rules  including  those  relating  to
    immigration status.  In any event,  Section  GEN.1.9.  of  Appendix  FM
    provided inter alia that the requirement to make  a  valid  application
    would not apply when the Article 8 claim was raised  inter  alia  "(iv)
    in an appeal" (my emphasis).

14. Ms  Brocklesby-Weller  submitted  that  the  judge's  errors  were  not
    material.  How Tyrone acquired British nationality was irrelevant.

15. There was nothing to suggest at [12] of the decision that  any  mistake
    made regarding who applied for citizenship for Tyrone and the confusion
    of dates I have set out at [10] above, infected the  judge's  decision.
    The judge raised his  concerns  at  [12]  regarding  the  appellant  as
    primary carer.  In particular, he said there was no explanation  as  to
    why the school did not have the appellant's present permanent  address.
    There was a letter  from  the  school  dated  27  June  2014  from  the
    Assistant Head Teacher which said that she had contact details relating
    to the father and Tyrone's aunt.  The judge went on  to  say  that  the
    letter confirmed the appellant had attended all parents'  evenings  and
    she was the person with whom the form teacher  liaised  directly.   Put
    simply, the judge's finding was that Tyrone lived the majority  of  the
    time with the appellant but his  father  had  input.   The  judge  gave
    reasons at [20] and [22] as to why Tyrone could remain  living  in  the
    United Kingdom in his mother's absence.

16. My attention was drawn to MA and SM (Zambrano: EU children outside  the
    EU) Iran [2013] UKUT 00380 (IAC) at [41].   In  particular,  [iii]  and
    [iv]:

         (iii)    It is for the national courts to determine, as a  question
             of fact on the evidence before it, whether an EU citizen would
             be compelled to leave the EU to follow a non-EU national  upon
             whom he is dependent.

         (iv) Nothing less than such compulsion will engage Articles 20  and
             21 of the TFEU.  In particular, EU law  will  not  be  engaged
             where the EU citizen is not compelled to leave the EU, even if
             the  quality  or  standard  of  life  of  the  EU  citizen  is
             diminished as a result of the non-EU national upon whom he  is
             dependent is (for example) removed or prevented  from  working
             ......"

17. The appellant's skeleton argument at [14] that there  was  no  evidence
    that Tyrone's father was either able or willing or both to care for him
    in the event that the appellant was forced to leave the United  Kingdom
    was the incorrect burden.  It was for the appellant to  show  that  his
    father was unable to care for him.  The judge did not err  in  what  he
    said at [20] and [22] as  there  was  no  explanation  as  to  why  the
    appellant's father could not assume responsibility for him.

18. Ms Brocklesby-Weller referred me to the Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
    2006 and in particular, to Regulation 26(7) Schedule 1 with  regard  to
    appeals to the First-tier or Upper Tribunal.  See Phelan at page 1385:

         "Regulation 26(7)

         Schedule 1

           Appeals to the [First-tier Tribunal or Upper Tribunal]

         [1]  The following provisions of, or made under, the 2002 Act  have
             effect in relation to an appeal under these Regulations to the
             [First-tier Tribunal or Upper Tribunal] Asylum and Immigration
             Tribunal as if  it  were  an  appeal  against  an  immigration
             decision under Section 82(1) of the Act:

                  Section 84(1), except paragraphs (a) and (f) ......"

19. As regards Section 84 grounds of appeal, the only applicable  provision
    relevant  to  the  appellant's  circumstances  is  84(1)(c)  "that  the
    decision is unlawful under Section 6 of the Human Rights  Act  1998  as
    being incompatible with the appellant's Convention  rights".   84(1)(g)
    was inapplicable given there was no removal decision.

20. The appellant was left with only Section 84(1)(c) but the decision  was
    only against  refusal  to  grant  a  derivative  residence  card.   The
    appellant's circumstances did not get over the first hurdle of  refusal
    in that there could be no interference with family life if there was no
    prospect of removal.  Having said that, even if there was interference,
    how could it be disproportionate in those circumstances?

Conclusion on Error of Law

21. Ms Brocklesby-Weller accepted that Ahmed included a concession at  [43]
    that on JM (Liberia) principles, the Tribunal should consider the  case
    on the basis that a putative consequence of the  refusal  decision  was
    that the respondent would proceed to direct her removal to Pakistan.

22. The relevant provision the appellant needed to satisfy was 15A(4A):

         "P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if

         (a)  P is the primary carer of a  British  citizen  ("the  relevant
             British citizen"):

         (b)  The  relevant  British  citizen  is  residing  in  the  United
             Kingdom; and

         (c)  the relevant British citizen would be unable to reside in  the
             UK or in another EEA state if P were required to leave.

23.  15A(7) provides:

         "P is to be regarded as a "primary carer" of another person if

         (a)  P is a direct relative or a legal guardian of that person; and

         (b)  P

             (i)  is the person who has  primary  responsibility  for  that
                  person's care; or

             (ii) shares equally the responsibility for that person's  care
                  with one other person who is not an exempt person."

24. I find the judge erred in  overlooking  the  criteria  for  primary  as
    opposed to shared responsibility for Tyrone  as  contained  within  the
    respondent's guidance I have referred to at [11]-[12]  above.  [18]  of
    the guidance with regard to primary  or  shared  responsibility  for  a
    child reads as follows:

         "18. In cases where the British citizen is a child under the age of
             18,  primary  or  shared  responsibility  will  generally   be
             established where  that  child  is  living  with  the  primary
             carer(s) and the majority of their care is being provided  for
             by  that  primary  carer(s).   Evidence  to  demonstrate  this
             responsibility can include custody/guardianship orders, or  if
             this is not available, any additional evidence which shows:

             .    that the child lives with the primary carer(s) or  spends
                  the majority of their time there;

             .    that the primary carer(s) makes the day-to-day  decisions
                  for that child, for example decisions  relating  to  their
                  education or health; and

             .    that the primary carer(s)  has  financial  responsibility
                  for that child."

25. The guidance goes on to say that how primary or  shared  responsibility
    is evidenced will vary depending on the facts  of  the  case,  but  the
    primary carer(s) may submit letters from the child's school, GP or from
    a solicitor to demonstrate primary/shared responsibility.

26. The judge misunderstood the evidence with regard to how Tyrone came  by
    his nationality.  A passport had already been issued for the  child  at
    the request  of  the  appellant  when  Tyrone's  father  unsuccessfully
    applied for a British passport for him.  Tyrone obtained citizenship on
    the  basis  of  his  having  been  born  here  and  having  lived  here
    continuously for ten  years  preceding  the  application  made  by  the
    appellant.  There was no issue regarding the  fact  that  Tyrone  lived
    with the appellant and spent the majority of his time there.   Further,
    there was no issue that the appellant  made  day-to-day  decisions  for
    Tyrone, with regard to his education and health.   The  fact  that  the
    judge identified a letter from the school dated 27 June 2014 which said
    that the Assistant Headteacher had  contact  details  relating  to  the
    father and Tyrone's  aunt  did  not  arguably  affect  that  situation,
    particularly bearing  in  mind  that  the  same  letter  confirmed  the
    appellant had attended all parents' evenings and  she  was  the  person
    with whom the form teacher directly liaised.

27. There was evidence from the appellant's GP confirming the  registration
    of herself and Tyrone and when they had both been last seen.  The judge
    said such a letter did not "prove" (my emphasis) the appellant had  the
    primary care of her son, however, that was arguably too high  a  burden
    to place upon the appellant.

28. There was additional evidence that Tyrone never stayed  overnight  with
    his father, saw him about once a week and sometimes went to  his  house
    to do homework.  Clearly, Tyrone was in contact with his father but  it
    did not follow  that  there  was  shared  responsibility,  particularly
    bearing in mind the financial  evidence  that  whilst  Tyrone's  father
    provided him with pocket money and sometimes bought  him  clothes,  the
    appellant provided for him financially.  See [10]  of  the  appellant's
    statement dated 13 August 2014.

29. I find the judge erred in his finding that the appellant  and  Tyrone's
    father  shared  responsibility   for   him   bearing   in   mind   that
    responsibility in the  context  of  the  EEA  Regulations  means  equal
    responsibility.  The judge fell  into  error  in  making  that  finding
    without giving adequate reasons for the same.

30. I find the judge  misdirected  himself  by  failing  to  determine  the
    appellant's case under R-LTRP of Appendix FM bearing in mind Ahmed  and
    JM I have referred to at [13] above.  The  judge  had  jurisdiction  to
    deal with Article 8 notwithstanding that there was no removal decision.
     Further, Ahmed established that failure to make  a  valid  application
    for limited leave to remain as a parent was  not  fatal  to  an  appeal
    under R-LTRPT of Appendix FM as long as all the relevant  material  (my
    emphasis) requirements of that Section were met.  How the appellant met
    all the relevant material requirements of R-LTRPT was set out  at  [22]
    of the appellant's representative's skeleton dated 18 August 2014.

31. Having rejected consideration of the appellant's circumstances under R-
    LTRPT at [25] of his decision, the judge went on to consider Article 8.
     The judge's finding that Tyrone could go to live with his  father  was
    not based upon the evidence before him.   Indeed,  there  had  been  no
    evidence in that regard,  notwithstanding that it was  the  appellant's
    burden to address that issue under 15A(4A)(c).  The judge did not  have
    sufficient information in terms of ZH (Tanzania) [2009] EWCA Civ 691 to
    make a finding regarding Tyrone's best interests. The judge  said  that
    it was not a case where Tyrone would be abandoned with no one  to  look
    after him in the event of his mother returning to her own country,  but
    there was no adequate evidence before the judge to enable him  to  come
    to that conclusion, which made his decision unsafe.

32. In the circumstances none of the findings of  the  judge  shall  stand.
    The appellant has shown errors of law in  the  decision  such  that  it
    should be set aside and heard again in the First-tier de novo.

Decision


33. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains errors of law, is  set
    aside, and shall be remitted to the First-tier to  be  heard  again  de
    novo by a judge sitting alone, not Judge A W Khan.

34. No anonymity direction is made.
