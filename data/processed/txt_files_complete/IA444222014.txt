                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Sarwar, Counsel instructed by Sanctuary Law
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant appealed against the Respondent's decision  to  refuse  a
    residence card on the basis of Regulations 2 and 6 of  the  Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations 2006 (the 2006 Regulations) on 20 October 2014.   The
    matter came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Watson  who,  on  27  May
    2015, dismissed the Appellant's appeal  on  the  grounds  that  he  had
    failed to establish that it was  a  genuine  marriage  which  had  been
    entered into, or that the Sponsor was  a  qualified  person  exercising
    Treaty rights in the United Kingdom.

2.   Permission to appeal that decision [D]  was  given  by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Taylor on 10 October 2015 and  the  Respondent  made  a  Rule  24
    response on 2 November 2015.

3.   The  differences  between  the  parties  are  clear  and  do  not  need
    repeating save to say they centre around the issue of whether the judge
    was entitled to conclude, and gave adequate reasons to  conclude,  that
    there was a sham marriage between the Appellant and the lady with  whom
    he lived and the mother of their child, a Czech national, in the United
    Kingdom.  Secondly, whether or not the evidence was sufficient,  as  an
    issue which had been raised in the Reasons for Refusal letter, to  show
    that the Sponsor was employed at the material date of the  hearing  and
    therefore, on the evidence, exercising Treaty rights.  I do not need to
    repeat the extensive arguments by reference to the  evidence  that  was
    cited to the judge.  However, of particular concern is that at [D26] of
    the decision where the judge said:

         "I find that the witness statements of the friends included in  the
         evidence add very little to the case, other than confirming that  a
         marriage ceremony took place, which I accept.  I give little weight
         to the friends' assessment of the relationship."


4.   This was a matter of concern  not  least  because  the  judge  gave  no
    reasons why  he  ascribed  little  weight  to  the  evidence  of  their
    assessment of the relationship: In the statement of MRC (AD  page  7-8)
    he identified the proximity of his relationship to  the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor and expressed the view:

         "The appellant and his wife seem really happy together.  As I  live
         with them I can see that they are in a genuine marriage.  They both
         share care for their child.  I work as a chef in the evenings so  I
         see them in the house together."


    He goes on to express his belief:


         "...the relationship between M and L is genuine and subsisting."


5.   The statement of a British  national  woman,  who  attended  the  civil
    ceremony and the religious marriage of the Appellant  and  the  Sponsor
    and stated that she had known the  Sponsor  since  the  marriage.   She
    stated:

         "3.  We often visit the appellant and his wife  at  their  home  in
             Nottingham.   I  believe  their  relationship  is   completely
             genuine.  They often visit us at our house in Nottingham.   We
             eat together.  We have parties together.


         4.   My husband and I often visit the appellant, his wife and child
             at their house in Nottingham.  They have a good  relationship.
             They are really good friends as well as partners.


         5.   The appellant's wife's  English  is  still  improving  so  the
             appellant interprets but she seems very happy.   They  have  a
             beautiful son.  The wife  likes  eating  pasta  and  rice  and
             sometimes Asian food.   She  also  likes  pizzas.   They  seem
             really happy.


         6.   The wife is a very caring mother to her son."


6.   Similarly, the statement  of  S  A  identified  his  knowledge  of  the
    Appellant over a number of  years,  attendance  at  the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor's civil ceremony and stated at paragraph 3:

         "3.  I believe that his relationship with his  wife  is  completely
             genuine.  They often visit my house  in  Nottingham.   We  eat
             together.  We have parties together.  We are both taxi drivers
             in the same company.


         4.   My wife and I often visit the appellant, his wife and child at
             their house in Nottingham.  They have a completely normal  and
             functioning relationship."


    He goes on to speak of the Sponsor's improving her English and the  son
    which they enjoy raising together.


7.   It seemed to me that since these three witnesses were not  impugned  by
    the judge's decision, in terms of the reliability of their recollection
    or their truthfulness, it needed a proper explanation as to  why  their
    evidence which, looking at the evidence  in  the  round  as  the  judge
    should have done, was so lightly dismissed with no material reasons  by
    the judge.  They are plainly, on the face of it external witnesses  who
    speak to longish knowledge of the Appellant and/or  Sponsor  let  alone
    their family life together.  I concluded that whilst the judge can,  as
    he properly did, identify a number of oddities about the initiation  of
    the relationship between the Appellant and  the  Sponsor,  nevertheless
    could  not  properly,  unless  better  reasoned,  simply  dismiss   the
    evidence.  Whilst the judge gave little weight to it  on  any  analysis
    with regard to the relationship, he makes no  reference  whatsoever  to
    that evidence.  I find that that is a material error of law.  It seemed
    also that the issue was not raised by the judge  with  the  Appellant's
    representative at the hearing and that was insufficient in the light of
    the case of R (Iran) [2005] EWCA Civ 982.

8.   Secondly, in relation to the issue of the Sponsor's employment  it  was
    clear as the judge's note properly recorded, that  when  the  Appellant
    was asked about the level of wages she  received,  confirmed  that  the
    wages were paid at a rate of �7.20 an hour and, even if that is said to
    be a mistake the interpreter made, the representative, Ms Mullen at the
    hearing did not notice the point.  The fact was that the payslip, as Ms
    Mullen could plainly have seen, stated the hourly rate  at  �7.50.   It
    may be as is now explained the case that the Sponsor was explaining the
    �7.20 as being a typographical  error  engaging  in  fact  her  monthly
    earnings of �720 odd.  The difficulty with this explanation  now  given
    is that it was not raised in the grounds of appeal settled by Ms Mullen
    in September 2015, where she  recited  paragraphs  30  and  31  of  the
    judge's decision [D]: Yet the grounds do not challenge that as  a  fact
    being either the evidence given nor did they assert that there  was  an
    error in the judge relying upon that  answer  nor  that  there  was  an
    interpretation failure which led to  a  misunderstanding  the  evidence
    being provided at the time.

9.   Although a great deal of time and argument was interestingly  taken  on
    the issue of whether the Sponsor has been self-employed, as Mr  McVeety
    correctly identified, whilst that may go to an issue of credibility  it
    does not go to the issue as to whether or not she  was  in  employment,
    exercising Treaty rights.  It seemed to me that the evidence was  to  a
    degree poorly assembled to present that past historic position.  It  is
    clear that the grounds, again settled by Ms Mullen, simply do  not  get
    to grips with the problem identified in D31 which was the rate  of  pay
    specified in the payslip produced to  evidence  the  Sponsor's  current
    employment.   Nevertheless,  the  judge  did  have  a   payslip   whose
    credibility and reliability was not challenged which  showed  that  the
    Sponsor was earning �724 per month.  To that extent, whether or not the
    error made in the evidence of the Sponsor is material,  the  judge  did
    not actually address the fact that she was, on the face of the document
    which was not rejected as unreliable, earning �720  a  month.   On  the
    face of it Mr McVeety's argument is attractive about the  issue  as  to
    the reliability of the interpretation but it seemed  to  me  that  that
    sits as part of  the  evidence  relating  to  the  apparently  reliable
    payslip.  Accordingly, it may be a thin point, but it did  seem  to  me
    that the judge's reasoning is  ultimately  driven  by  the  discrepancy
    rather than a proper recognition of the actual  pay  received.   It  is
    also clear that the payslip shows payment was in cash and it  was  said
    to be, and it is, by no means an extraordinary  arrangement,  that  the
    cash was banked. Therefore the reference to earnings being in the bank,
    the judge's note was by no means  unambiguous  as  to  whether  it  was
    really an assertion that the money  was  being  paid  by  the  employer
    direct into the bank or the money ended up in the bank, as the  Sponsor
    says, as paid in by her.

10.  Accordingly, I was satisfied that these two  matters  bearing  in  mind
    the age of their child, the fact that they are bringing  the  child  up
    together raised real concerns about the assessment as to whether it was
    a sham marriage.  If the view is taken  that  it  was  not  a  properly
    entered into marriage that there may well be another  basis  under  the
    2006 Regulations for the Appellant to remain but that  is  for  another
    day.

DECISION

11.  The Original Tribunal's decision can not stand and the matter  will  be
    returned to the First-tier Tribunal to be re-made  in  accordance  with
    the law.

DIRECTIONS

    (1)  The appeal is to be re-listed in Nottingham, not before First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Watson.


    (2)  Time estimate - 2 hours.


    (3)  Interpreter required - Czech language.


    (4)  Any further documents relied upon or  relating  to  the  issue  of
         employment of the Sponsor to be provided to the First-tier Tribunal
         (IAC) and to the Home Office not later than ten working days before
         the date of hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.

ANONYMITY
12.  In light of the fact that the Appellant has a young  child  I  find  it
    appropriate for an anonymity order to be made.

DIRECTION REGARDING ANONYMITY - RULE 14 OF  THE  TRIBUNAL  PROCEDURE  (UPPER
TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

Signed                                  Date 4 May2016
