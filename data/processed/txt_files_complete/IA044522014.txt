Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on  10  April  1981.   He
    appealed against the respondent's refusal to grant him leave to  remain
    as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant under the  points-based  system  dated  9
    January  2014.   It  was  not  accepted  that  the  appellant  met  the
    requirements of paragraph 245HD of  HC  395  (as  amended)  because  in
    summary, the appellant's  certificate  of  sponsorship  said  that  his
    salary  would  be  �15,000  per  annum  which  was  below  the  minimum
    requirement of �20,300 per annum.

 2. In a decision promulgated on  8  September  2014,  Judge  Cameron  (the
    judge) found that the appellant could not show he  could  rely  on  the
    policy guidance in connection with a grant of leave prior  to  6  April
    2011.   The appellant was granted leave on 5 April 2012  such  that  he
    did not satisfy the policy guidance  he  relied  upon  that  where  the
    previous leave was granted under the Rules in place before 6 April 2011
    he was not subject to the  salary  threshold  of  �20,300.   The  judge
    considered Article 8 in terms of Section 19 of the Immigration Act 2014
    and paragraph 117B in terms of the  public  interest  requirements  but
    found that the appellant could re-establish himself in  Bangladesh  and
    that the respondent's decision was proportionate.

 3. The grounds challenged the judge's finding  that  the  policy  guidance
    relied upon by the  appellant  stated  that  where  previously  it  was
    granted under the Rules in place before 6 April 2011, then he  was  not
    subject to the salary threshold of �20,300.  The  grounds  referred  to
    the respondent's own website at [2] of the grounds, indicating that the
    job must pay �20,500 or more unless the  applicant's  current  or  last
    permission to stay in the UK is as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant before  6
    April 2011.  The grounds submitted that the relevant date was not  when
    the leave was granted but when the application was made and under which
    Rule the application was made with the resultant leave  being  granted.
    In the appellant's case,  the  COS  (Certificate  of  Sponsorship)  and
    application pre-dated 6 April 2011.  The appellant made his application
    before 6 April 2011 and irrespective of when the leave was granted,  it
    must have been granted in accordance with the Rules  in  place  at  the
    time of the application.  The crucial date was when the application was
    made.  Then as a matter of law, the application was decided  after  the
    "cut-off" date but with reference to the Rules in force before the "cut-
    off point".

 4. The proposition advanced by the appellant  was  supported  by  Edgehill
    [2014] EWCA Civ 402  which  made  clear  that  the  relevant  date  for
    consideration was the date of the application.

 5. It was claimed that the judge further  arguably  erred  in  failing  to
    appreciate that the appellant would have a legitimate expectation  that
    having applied before 6 April 2011, his leave would  be  granted  under
    the terms in force before that date and that was an aspect which should
    have featured in the judge's Article 8 assessment.

 6. Put simply, the grounds claim that having  applied  prior  to  6  April
    2011, the appellant's leave was granted in accordance with the Rules in
    place at that date, despite the leave being granted afterwards.

 7. Judge Foudy refused permission to appeal on 23 October 2014.  She found
    that the relevant date was that of the grant  of  leave  such  that  no
    arguable error was disclosed by the application.

 8.  The  grounds  were  resubmitted.   Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Eshun  gave
    permission to appeal the judge's decision on  10  February  2015.   She
    found that it was arguable that the judge erred in his finding which  I
    have set out above at [2].

 9. Thus the matter came before me.

Submissions on Error of Law

10. Ms Brocklesby-Weller helpfully conceded that the judge had erred.  That
    was because the appellant had made an application before 6  April  2012
    such that it fell to be decided in accordance with the Rules  in  force
    on 5 April 2012.

Conclusion on Error of Law

11. The judge erred at [19] of his decision that the appellant was  subject
    to  an  income  threshold  of  �20,300  since  that  income   threshold
    requirement only applied to applications made after 6 April 2012.

12. The judge made an error of law.  I set aside his  decision  and  remake
    the decision by allowing the appeal.

TO THE RESPONDENT

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  fee  award
of any fee which has been paid or may be payable.
