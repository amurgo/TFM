Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Dewison, a Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Selway instructed by Halliday Reeves Law Firm


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is the Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  who,
    on 1st November, 2012 decided to make a deportation order  against  the
    respondent.  In doing so, the appellant said:-

         "On 15th November, 2011 at Teeside Crown Court, you were  convicted
         on production of class B controlled drug - cannabis.  The Secretary
         of State  has  considered  the  offence  of  which  you  have  been
         convicted and your conduct, in accordance with Regulation 21 of the
         Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006.   She  is
         satisfied that you would pose a genuine, present  and  sufficiently
         serious threat to the  interests  of  public  policy  if  you  were
         allowed to remain in the United Kingdom and that  your  deportation
         is justified under Regulation 21.  She has therefore decided  under
         Regulation 19(3)(b) that you should be removed and an order made in
         accordance with Regulation 24(3) requiring you to leave the  United
         Kingdom and prohibiting you from re-entering while the order was in
         force.  For the  purpose  of  the  order  Section  3(5)(a)  of  the
         Immigration Act 1971 will apply.


         The Secretary of State proposes to give directions for your removal
         to Spain, the country of which you are a  national  or  which  most
         recently provided you with a travel document."


2.   The respondent gave Notice of Appeal and his  appeal  was  heard  by  a
    panel of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Sacks
    sitting with Mrs R M Bray).

3.   The First-tier Tribunal allowed  the  respondent's  immigration  appeal
    and also allowed the respondent's Article 8 European Convention for the
    protection of Human  Rights  and  Fundamental  Freedoms,  human  rights
    appeal.

4.   The appellant  challenged  the  determination.   The  first  challenge,
    under the Regulations, noted that in paragraph 11 of the determination,
    the panel notes that the risk of the respondent re-offending  "is  very
    low".  However, the grounds point out that the respondent was  assessed
    as being at a low risk of re-offending, not "very low".  The panel have
    given no reasons for departing from the  NOMS  assessment  and,  it  is
    suggested, has erred.  It also  suggested  that  the  panel  failed  to
    consider the risk of harm of  any  re-offending  or  the  Secretary  of
    State's view of crimes involving drugs and  the  serious  effect  these
    have on society.  While  the  panel  noted  the  levels  of  protection
    against removal under Regulation 21 for deportation, it has  failed  to
    note that  the  respondent  did  not  have  the  benefit  of  permanent
    residence with the higher level of  protection  this  affords  but  the
    lowest level such that the Secretary of State simply has to  show  that
    there were grounds of public policy, public security or public  health.
    The panel's failure to look at the test  to  be  applied,  particularly
    when it took into account the determination  in  the  case  of  Roberto
    Spiniello [1996] IAT 13916 to which the 2006 Regulations did not apply,
    arguably flawed the panel's assessment.

5.   The second challenge dealt with the Tribunal's decision in  respect  of
    the respondent's Article 8 rights.   The  grounds  suggested  that  the
    Immigration Rules reflected the Secretary of State's view as  to  where
    the balance lay in between  the  individual's  rights  and  the  public
    interest.  In considering  proportionality  the  Tribunal  should  have
    taken account of the Secretary of State's view, endorsed by Parliament,
    on how public policy  considerations  are  weighed  against  individual
    family and private life rights.  The Tribunal further erred by  failing
    to consider any case law, particularly OH (Serbia) [2008] EWCA Civ 89.

6.   Mr Dewison drew my attention to the fact that the respondent  had  been
    assessed as being of "low" risk of re-offending even  though  the  pre-
    sentence report described the respondent as  representing  a  very  low
    risk of harm and presenting an extremely low risk of re-offending.  The
    OASys Report is significant, since it was compiled, of course,  towards
    the end of the respondent's sentence as  opposed  to  the  pre-sentence
    report which was  prepared  to  assist  the  court  in  sentencing  the
    respondent.  Even someone who is at  low  risk  of  re-offending  still
    represents a risk, he said.  The Tribunal had not set out the test  and
    have made no mention of Regulation 21(1)-(4).  They have not  therefore
    considered the different levels of protection.  The case they do  refer
    to of Spiniello is of no application since it was a case decided  under
    the 2006 Regulations.

7.   As to the Article 8 appeal, the panel had no  regard  to  OH  (Serbia).
    In considering the respondent's Article 8  appeal  they  said,  at  the
    bottom of page 8 and the top of page 9,  "we  are  satisfied  that  the
    appellant has a level of relationship with  his  fiancï¿½e  and  children
    albeit that there is very little  information  concerning  this".   The
    Tribunal just simply had insufficient evidence to make any such finding
    and the Tribunal's assessment of the Article 8 case is deficient  also.
    He invited me to allow the Secretary of State's appeal.

8.   For the respondent, Mr Selway  told  me  that  the  grounds  failed  to
    disclose any error of law.  The reference to "very low"  in  describing
    the respondent's risk of  re-offending  is  a  reference  to  the  pre-
    sentence report but  page  19  of  the  OASys  Report  shows  that  the
    predicted scores as expressed as a percentage are 6% in year 1 and  11%
    in year 2.  The category banding is described as being "low"  but  only
    because there are three bands, low, medium and high.  If  there  was  a
    "very low" band then this  respondent  would  surely  be  in  it.   The
    Tribunal were entitled to describe  the  risk  of  the  respondent  re-
    offending as being very low.  It is at the low end of low.

9.   So far as the test under the Regulations  is  concerned,  the  Tribunal
    did set out the test at  the  beginning  of  their  determination.   At
    paragraph 2 they refer to Regulation 21 and say that the  Secretary  of
    State was satisfied that the respondent would pose  a  genuine  present
    and sufficiently serious threat to the interests of public  policy,  if
    he were allowed to remain in  the  UK.   That  was  the  correct  test.
    Spiniello does predate the current Regulations, but  it  was  the  same
    test under the earlier Regulations also.  Looked at in the round  there
    is no error in assessing the Article 8 claim.

10.  Responding,  Mr  Dewison  confirmed  that  in  the  event  that  I  was
    satisfied that there was no error  on  the  part  of  the  Tribunal  in
    considering the issue of the deportation  order  then  whether  or  not
    there is an error on their part in considering the respondent's Article
    8 appeal is immaterial.

11.   I  believe  that  the  respondent's  challenge  is  no  more  than  an
    expression  of  disagreement  with  the  panel's   determination.    At
    paragraph 11 the panel said this:-

         "We have had regard to the reports that are within the papers  that
         we consider  with  regard  to  the  appellant's  offences  and  his
         propensity to reoffend.  The risk of reoffending is very  low.   We
         take into account that he pleaded guilty to this offence,  that  he
         had no previous convictions and that at the time he was in a  state
         of depression having financial problems because of his drugs  habit
         we are satisfied he has now under control.


         The likelihood of  the  [respondent]  offending  is  a  significant
         factor in considering  whether  it  is  proportionate  in  all  the
         circumstances to deport this [respondent].  Regulation  21  of  the
         Regulations identifies the criteria that we must have  regard  for.
         We do not intend to reiterate verbatim Regulation 21 but  have  had
         regard to  that  Regulation  and  note  that  a  person's  previous
         criminal convictions do not in themselves  justify  a  decision  to
         deport.


         We are aware that we must consider the principle of proportionality
         and must consider the conduct of the [respondent]  and  whether  he
         represents  a  genuine  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
         affecting one of the fundamental interests of society, we are aware
         that matters isolated from the particulars of  the  case  or  which
         relate to considerations of general prevention  do  not  justify  a
         decision to deport.


         We are aware that we must take  into  account  the  age,  state  of
         health, family and economic situation of the [respondent]  and  his
         length of residence in  the  United  Kingdom  and  his  social  and
         cultural integration into the United Kingdom and the extent of  his
         links with his country of origin.  We  confirm  that  we  have  had
         consideration for all these relevant factors.  We note the case  of
         Roberto Spiniello and the fact that that appeal succeeded and  that
         that appellant had committed far more serious and heinous  offences
         than committed by this [respondent], the offence  the  [respondent]
         was convicted of is not in our opinion one that is found at the top
         end of the sale of offending.


         We are satisfied that this [respondent's] case is not  exceptional,
         it would not cause such public revulsion as to justify removal  and
         we are satisfied that the [respondent's] personal conduct does  not
         represent a genuine present and sufficiently serious threat to  one
         of the fundamental interests of society  such  as  to  justify  the
         [respondent's] deportation from the United Kingdom."

12.   The  pre-sentence  report  describes  the  respondent's  risk  of  re-
    offending as being very low, but the OASys Report describes it as  low.
    However, I think there is merit in the suggestion  made  by  Mr  Selway
    that when one looks at the predicted scores as a percentage for year  1
    and year 2 as being 6% and 11%, then one can understand why  the  panel
    described the risk as being "very low".  It is described as  being  low
    because there are only three bands, low, medium or high.  The  risk  in
    the respondent's case is clearly at the low end of the low band.  I  do
    not believe that the panel erred in describing it as  being  very  low,
    because it is; anything below 15% could,  in  my  view,  accurately  be
    described as being "very low".

13.  The Tribunal considered  the  offence  for  which  the  respondent  was
    convicted and were entitled to express the opinion that it was  not  at
    the top end of the scale of offending.  It involved class B drugs  and,
    quite rightly attracted a two year prison sentence, but it  would  have
    been far more serious had it involved a class  A  drug  or  if  it  had
    involved violence.  I do not believe that  the  panel  have  failed  to
    appreciate the seriousness of the  offence  and  I  believe  they  were
    entitled to say what they did in the penultimate and  in  the  ultimate
    paragraph of paragraph 11 of the  determination  which  I  have  quoted
    above.

14.  It is true that the panel had not set out Regulation 21, but they  have
    demonstrated both in paragraph 2 and paragraph 11 of the determination,
    that they are aware of the relevant test applicable in this appeal  and
    that they have applied it.

15.  I have concluded, therefore, that there was no error  on  the  part  of
    the Tribunal in deciding the respondent's deportation appeal.

16.  Mr Dewison, quite properly, agreed that any error that there  might  be
    in the panel's consideration of the respondent's Article 8 appeal would
    be irrelevant in the event that I found there was no error  of  law  in
    the panel's consideration of the respondent's deportation appeal.

17.  I find that the panel did not err in relation  to  their  consideration
    of the respondent's deportation appeal and I uphold it.  As  a  result,
    it is not necessary for me to consider whether the panel erred  in  its
    consideration of the respondent's Article 8 appeal.
