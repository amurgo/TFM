Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Winter, Advocate, instructed by Katani & Co.
Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is an undocumented Bidoon from Kuwait.  She is recognised
    as a refugee in Sweden.  Mr [N J] is also an undocumented  Bidoon  from
    Kuwait.  He has refugee status in the United Kingdom.  The two of  them
    have a relationship: whether  or  not  it  is  recognised  as  a  valid
    marriage in the United Kingdom, in Sweden,  or  anywhere  else  is  not
    entirely certain.

 2.  The  appellant  made  an  application  under  paragraph  352A  of  the
    Immigration Rules for reunion with Mr [J] as his wife.  It  is,  as  we
    understand it, accepted not merely  that  that  application  could  not
    succeed, but that it was clear from the beginning  that  it  could  not
    succeed.  The appellant then claimed that despite  not  being  able  to
    succeed under the Immigration Rules, it would be disproportionate,  and
    a breach of article 8 of the European Convention on Human  Rights,  not
    to admit her to the United Kingdom to live with Mr [J],  following  the
    application under paragraph 352A which she had made.

 3. Judge Agnew, who heard the appeal in the First-tier Tribunal, concluded
    that the two of them were not legally  married  but  that  they  had  a
    relationship that she was prepared to recognise  for  the  purposes  of
    article 8.  She noted, however, that they had only lived together for a
    very short period of time, and that if they wish to live  together  now
    there seemed to be no reason why Mr [J] should not  live  with  her  in
    Sweden.  Further, as the judge noted, there  are  other  avenues  which
    they might pursue in order to live together in the United Kingdom:  for
    example, the appellant might apply for a visa with a view to entry as a
    fiancï¿½e.  Judge Agnew dismissed the appeal.

 4. The grounds of appeal to this Tribunal assert that there were areas  of
    law in assessing proportionality.  Permission to appeal was granted  by
    Judge Scott Baker: her determination  does  not  really  indicate  what
    point she considered arguable, or why.

 5. So far as concerns the matters that were canvassed  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge,  it  is  clear  beyond  a  peradventure  that  the
    appellant  and  those  acting  for  her  made  no  attempt  at  all  to
    demonstrate why she should be granted  entry  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules, having failed to attempt to establish any right under the Rules.
     The formal details of the relationship were elusive;  the  details  of
    the relationship itself were vestigial; there was no  evidence  of  the
    circumstances in which the appellant is living  now  or  in  which  the
    couple would live if she were admitted.  A claim  based  on  article  8
    outside the Rules needs to be  accompanied  by  evidence  both  of  the
    circumstances the  continuation  of  which  is  said  to  amount  to  a
    disproportionate interference with the individual's family and  private
    life, and some comparative information from which it could be concluded
    that the proposed remedy overcomes  that  disproportionality.   Without
    such material, a claim based on article 8 is hopelessly inchoate.

 6.  For  those  reasons  the  judge  was  obviously  right  to  reach  the
    conclusions she did.

 7. There is a further issue, which was not canvassed before  her.   As  we
    pointed out to Mr Winter, the appellant appears to have made no attempt
    to have her refugee status  transferred  to  the  United  Kingdom.   In
    general, as we put it to him, the question is why, on the evidence,  is
    it said that it is disproportionate to expect the appellant to make the
    correct application instead of trying to build on  the  refusal  of  an
    application which could not succeed.   He  indicated  that  he  had  no
    sensible response to that point.  We did  not  need  to  call  upon  Mr
    Govan.

 8. The appellant's appeal is dismissed.
