                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. In this  appeal  I  will  refer  to  the  parties  in  the  order  and
      description by which they appeared before the First-Tier Tribunal.

   2. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh and is male.  He was  born  7
      June 1962.

   3. The appellant originally applied for entry clearance to United Kingdom
      as a visitor for the purpose of marriage.  The  application  was  made
      and considered under paragraph 56(D) of the  Immigration  Rules.   The
      appellant had been sponsored by  his  fiancï¿½e.   The  application  was
      refused because the respondent did not consider that the  requirements
      of the appropriate paragraph had been satisfied.  No right  of  appeal
      exists in respect of such application and decision save for a  limited
      right under Section 84(1)(c) of the Nationality, Immigration &  Asylum
      Act  2002.   This  being  that  the  decision  is  unlawful  as  being
      incompatible with  the  appellant's  rights  under  the  Human  Rights
      Convention.  The appellant exercised his right to appeal by  reference
      thereto.

   4. The matter came before Judge of the First-Tier Tribunal  Lobo  sitting
      at Taylor House on 16 December 2013.  An oral hearing was  held.   The
      sponsor and her daughter attended and gave evidence.   The  respondent
      was not represented.

   5. In a determination dated 2 January 2014 the judge reached findings  by
      reference to the evidence before him and allowed the appeal "on  human
      rights grounds".

   6. The respondent sought leave to appeal.  Two  grounds  of  appeal  were
      listed firstly  failure  to  give  reasons  or  adequate  reasons  for
      findings on a material matter and secondly a material misdirection  in
      law.

   7. In amplification of the grounds  the  respondent  indicated  that  the
      judge had  failed  to  give  adequate  consideration  as  to  why  the
      appellant and sponsor could not marry in Bangladesh  given  that  they
      were two consenting  adults  and  could  additionally  continue  their
      married life in that country.

   8. In respect of the second ground  the  judge  had  failed  to  consider
      whether  there  were  any  insurmountable  objects  to   family   life
      continuing outside the United Kingdom and that the judge had failed to
      consider the Article 8 provisions introduced into the Rules  and  that
      the judge had failed to properly consider the case of MF  (Nigeria)  v
      SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192.  There were no exceptional circumstances in
      this case.

   9. In granting leave to appeal another Judge of the  First-Tier  Tribunal
      found as follows:-

         3.   "It is arguable that the judge  has  not  fully  reasoned  his
             decision to allow the appeal under Article 8.

         4.   The grounds show an arguable error of law.

         5.   All grounds are arguable".

  10. Thus the matter comes before me in the Upper Tribunal.  There  was  no
      appearance on behalf of the appellant.  I note that a few  days  prior
      to the hearing an application had been made on behalf of the appellant
      for the case to be adjourned.  The application was  made  because  the
      appellant's named representative was unable to attend the  hearing  as
      she had recently given birth to a baby.   That  application  had  been
      placed before a Judge of  the  Upper  Tribunal  who  had  refused  the
      application upon the basis that the appellant is outside  the  country
      and the representative, Miss Hoque, had merely assisted the  appellant
      and was not a legal representative.

  11. The application form was not renewed before me.   However  I  do  note
      that whilst clearly Miss Hoque was not a legal representative she  has
      been named throughout as being the appellant's representative  in  the
      United Kingdom and it would have been appropriate for her to attend if
      she could.  However as no application for adjournment  was  before  me
      and Mr Whitwell was not in a position to make an application I decided
      to proceed with the appeal.

  12. Mr Whitwell lied upon the application for leave.  He produced the case
      of Shahzad (Article 8: Legitimate Aim) [2014]  UKUT  0085  (IAC).   He
      referred in particular to  paragraphs  31  and  25  of  that  reported
      decision.  He submitted that the findings of the judge with regard  to
      the inability to marry in Bangladesh were not open to him.  There  was
      a localised problem which might have prevented marriage.  He asked  me
      to find an error of law.  I reserved my decision.

  13. I have noted the contents of Shahzad, I am of course aware  that  this
      case was not heard by the Upper  Tribunal  until  after  the  date  of
      promulgation of Judge Lobo's determination.  Indeed  Shahzad  was  not
      promulgated until a month after the respondent's application for leave
      was submitted.  Despite that I  have  considered  the  parts  of  that
      decision to which I have been referred.

  14. From the determination it is clear that the judge of  course  realised
      that in essence the application was for a Visit Visa  for  a  specific
      purpose.  The decision as a result of that application did not carry a
      right of appeal under the Rules.  The appellant had claimed  a  breach
      of his human right and via Section 84(1)(c) he was given  a  right  of
      appeal to the First-Tier Tribunal.

  15. The judge had before him the evidence of the sponsor together with the
      respondent's bundle and some supporting documentation.  The judge made
      clear findings from the evidence before him.  The facts  and  evidence
      were fairly concise and I am satisfied that the  judge  gave  adequate
      reasons for the findings that he made.  It was not necessary  for  him
      to go into any great detail because the issues  were  limited.   I  am
      satisfied therefore that the judge did give adequate reasoning  and  I
      do not consider that the respondent has made out the first of the  two
      grounds alleging error.


  16. I consider the judge correctly directed himself with regard to the law
      as he found it at the time of the hearing.  He  correctly  takes  into
      account MF (Nigeria) from the Court of  Appeal.   He  could  not  have
      anticipated the findings of  Shahzad  although  it  is  arguable  that
      consideration should have been given to guidance in Gulshan (Article 8
      - New Rules - Correct Approach [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC), however I do not
      consider that an examination of that case would have resulted  in  the
      judge coming to any other conclusion.  The judge was aware,  as  am  I
      that in essence this was a Visit Visa Appeal with limited leave  being
      the result of any successful application  certainly  no  permanent  or
      even lengthy settlement  in  the  intention  of  the  parties  to  the
      engagement.  The judge came to a conclusion with regard to the ability
      to marry in  Bangladesh.   That  conclusion  might  well  be  open  to
      criticism that in reaching findings I do not consider that  the  judge
      aired in law.  He was entitled to reach the conclusions that  he  did.
      The respondent's argument in respect of  Ground  2  is  therefore  not
      successful.



17. In all the circumstances the judge's decision must stand.

18. The respondent's appeal is dismissed.
