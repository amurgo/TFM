For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals from the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Aujla sitting at Taylor House on 22 November 2017, whereby he refused a
    request for the hearing to be adjourned, and he went on to  dismiss  on
    the  merits  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of   the
    respondent to refuse his protection and human rights claims. The First-
    tier Tribunal made an anonymity direction, and I consider  that  it  is
    appropriate that the appellant's  anonymity  is  maintained  for  these
    proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 10 January 2018, First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Robertson  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal for the  following
    reasons:

         "There is some arguable merit in the  grounds  because,  given  the
         sick note provided to the Judge indicated that  the  Appellant  was
         suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting, it may be argued  that  this
         would indicate why he would be unable to attend the hearing. It  is
         arguable that this resulted in an arguable error of law in that the
         Appellant was not given the opportunity to put his case before  The
         Tribunal."

Relevant Background Facts

 3. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, whose date of birth is 3  June
    1992.  He arrived in the UK in 2011 with valid  entry  clearance  as  a
    student. He then overstayed, and  he  was  served  with  administrative
    removal papers as an overstayer on 4 August 2016. He claimed asylum  in
    2017. He said that he  had  fled  Pakistan  in  2011  to  escape  local
    problems with the Taliban (because he had ceased attending a  madrassa)
    and also because he had been involved with  a  land  dispute  with  his
    cousin, who had unlawfully seized a quarter of an acre  of  land  worth
    ï¿½9,000 which belonged to him.  The  appellant  was  given  a  screening
    interview on 11 April  2017,  and  he  attended  a  substantive  asylum
    interview on 18 September 2017.

 4. On 10 October 2017 the Secretary of State gave her reasons for refusing
    to recognise him as a refugee.  Firstly,  his  account  was  internally
    inconsistent, implausible and lacking in detail.  Secondly, his claimed
    fear of the Taliban and his cousin on return was  neither  genuine  nor
    objectively well-founded, as there was sufficient protection  available
    to him from the Pakistani authorities and because he  could  reasonably
    relocate elsewhere in Pakistan to avoid his cousin and others with whom
    he claimed to have had problems with in the past.

 5. On 25 October 2017 the appellant and his solicitors  were  notified  by
    first class post of both the date of the  pre-hearing  review  and  the
    date of the substantive hearing. Directions were  also  issued  on  the
    same date requiring the appellant to serve on  the  Tribunal  and  HOPO
    unit the evidence upon which he  wished  to  rely  at  the  substantive
    hearing.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 6. No bundle of documents was filed with  the  Tribunal  pursuant  to  the
    directions given on 25 October 2017.

 7. On 21 November 2017, the Appellant faxed an adjournment request to  the
    Tribunal. He produced a sick notice from his GP dated 21 November  2017
    certifying that he was unfit to  work  from  16  November  2017  to  24
    November 2017 and in his covering  letter  he  said  that  due  to  his
    serious diarrhoea and vomiting he had not been able to  attend  at  the
    offices of his solicitors to prepare his appeal statement and bundle of
    documents.

 8. At the outset of the hearing on 22 November 2017, Mr  Hussein  of  Reza
    Solicitors renewed the adjournment request.  As  he  explained  in  his
    subsequent decision at [15], the Judge  put  the  matter  back  for  Mr
    Hussein to make further inquiries because (a) the sick notice  did  not
    indicate that the appellant was unfit  to  travel  to  court  and  give
    evidence; (b) there had been  a  total  lack  of  preparation  for  the
    hearing and (c) the  appellant  had  an  adverse  immigration  history,
    including a past record of absconding.

 9. On the resumption of the hearing, Mr Hussein was unable to confirm that
    the appellant had seen a doctor on 21 November 2017 or that, if he had,
    he had told the doctor that he was due  to  attend  court.  Mr  Hussein
    agreed that, as the appellant was not working, the sick notice was  not
    relevant. He also agreed that there was no explanation as  to  why  the
    appellant had not provided instructions to his firm before 16  November
    2017 to enable them to prepare his case.

10. Mr Mavrantonis, Presenting Officer, strongly  opposed  the  adjournment
    request. He challenged the genuineness of the claim that the  appellant
    was truly unwell and therefore unable to attend the hearing.

11. Having heard from both representatives, the  Judge  ruled  against  the
    adjournment request. In his subsequent decision at paragraphs  [13]  to
    [20]., he devoted over two closely typed pages to  the  issue,  setting
    out very fully the evidence tendered by the  appellant,  the  arguments
    advanced by the Presenting Officer and his  reasons  for  refusing  the
    adjournment.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

12. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Mr Hyder developed the arguments advanced in the grounds of appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal.  The appellant  had  disclosed  his  GP  medical
    record which showed that he had seen a doctor on 21 November  2017.  So
    the Judge had been wrong to question whether the appellant had  seen  a
    doctor. Mr Hyder agreed that the  same  record  also  showed  that  the
    appellant had not attended for a follow-up appointment on  24  November
    2017, as he had indicated that he was going to do when applying for the
    adjournment.

13. Ms Everett submitted that the record of the appellant's  attendance  at
    the surgery on 21 November 2017 did not address the  issue  of  whether
    the appellant was unfit to attend court or was unable to  instruct  his
    solicitors. There was no evidence that the only way in which the doctor
    could declare that the appellant was  unfit  to  attend  court  was  by
    issuing a sick note certifying that he was unfit to work.

Discussion

14. I consider that the Judge gave adequate reasons for refusing  to  grant
    an adjournment on the evidence that was available to  him  and  in  the
    light of what was said by Mr Hussein on the resumption of the  hearing.
    The Judge's reasons were in summary as follows:

          a) The sick note did not address the issue -  which  was  whether
             the appellant was unable to travel to court to give  evidence,
             even if he was unfit for work;

          b) The sick note was issued  the  day  before  the  hearing,  and
             backdated  to  five  days  earlier  "which  is  difficult   to
             understand";

          c)  There  was  no  explanation  for  the  appellant  not  giving
             instructions to his solicitors prior to 16 November, which was
             the day before when he claimed to have fallen ill;

          d) He was not satisfied that the sick note was a true  reflection
             of the appellant's condition;

          e) The Presenting Officer's submission  that  the  appellant  was
             simply attempting to buy  more  time  was  clearly  made  out,
             having regard to the appellant's adverse immigration  history,
             including make a very late claim for asylum only after removal
             directions were issued against him.

15. The fact  that  the  Judge  gave  adequate  reasons  for  refusing  the
    adjournment is  not  determinative  of  the  question  of  whether  the
    appellant has been the victim of procedural unfairness.

16. But I do not consider that the disclosure  of  the  GP  medical  record
    assists his case. While it shows that he saw a doctor  on  21  November
    2017 in order to obtain a sick note, it does not show that  the  doctor
    made an evaluation that he was unfit to attend court the next  day.  In
    fact it is damaging to the  appellant's  general  credibility  for  two
    reasons. Firstly, the doctor records that the appellant  kept  changing
    the number of days for which he said he had been  sick.  Secondly,  the
    doctor records the appellant as saying he was "feeling better now"; and
    that he did not have any blood in his stools and he was  not  suffering
    from any fevers. In short, no ongoing  symptoms  are  recorded  by  the
    doctor in his notes.

17. In issuing him with a sick note which  was  backdated  to  17  November
    2017, the doctor was giving the appellant a few more days off  work  by
    way of recovery from the acute episode which he  claimed  that  he  had
    experienced after eating rice at home on 17 November 2017.

18. The Judge has been vindicated in his finding that the sick note was not
    a true reflection of the appellant's  condition  at  the  time  of  its
    issue. The appellant was not suffering from diarrhoea and  vomiting  on
    21 November 2017.

19. In conclusion, the appellant has not persuaded me that the decision  to
    refuse an adjournment was wrong, or that material  unfairness  resulted
    from the hearing of his appeal proceeding in his absence.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - rule 14 of the Upper Tribunal Rules 2008

Unless and until a tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
