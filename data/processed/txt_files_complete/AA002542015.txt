Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Jaisri, Counsel, instructed by Kanaga Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Miss Isherwood (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka. The appellant claimed to  have
    entered the United Kingdom on October 2, 2013. He  claimed  asylum  the
    same day and was served with form IS 151A as  an  illegal  entrant.  He
    attended an asylum interview on March 20, 2014 but his claim for asylum
    was refused on November 24, 2014 under paragraph 336  HC  395  and  the
    same day a decision was taken to remove him by way of directions  under
    paragraphs 8-10 of schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971.

 2.  The  appellant  appealed  under  section  82(1)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on January  7,  2015  arguing  that  if
    returned he was at risk or persecution.

 3. The matter came before Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Woodcraft  on
    April 20, 2015 and in a decision  promulgated  on  April  29,  2015  he
    refused the appellant's claims  for  asylum,  humanitarian  claims  and
    under article 8 ECHR.

 4. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on May 12, 2015 and on  May  21,
    2015  Designated  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  McCarthy   gave
    permission to appeal finding  there  were  arguable  grounds  that  the
    Tribunal had erred by refusing to adjourn the appeal  when  faced  with
    the evidence presented to him.

 5. The respondent filed a Rule 24 response and  disputing  any  unfairness
    and submitted  the  Tribunal  had  been  entitled  to  proceed  without
    adjourning the hearing.

 6. This case came before me on  the  above  date  and  both  parties  were
    represented as set out above.

    DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

 7. The Tribunal had refused an adjournment request in this matter and gave
    reasons for that decision in paragraphs [11] to [12] of  its  decision.
    The Tribunal noted:

      a. At 9.15am counsel as made aware by instructing solicitors that they
         had received a call  from  the  appellant's  friend  who  said  the
         appellant was unwell yesterday  with  diarrhoea  and  sickness  the
         previous day and was still unwell. The friend told  the  solicitors
         he was taking him to A and E.

      b. No one had actually spoken to the  appellant  on  the  day  of  the
         hearing.

      c. The  case  was  put  back  in  the  list  for  thirty  minutes  for
         instructions to be obtained.

      d. The appellant's friend confirmed the appellant was still waiting at
         A and E and the staff were unwilling to confirm he was there.

      e. He considered an  adjournment  request  and  applied  the  test  in
         Nwaigwe [2014] UKUT] 418 and found:

               i. No direct evidence why he had failed to attend court.

              ii. No one had spoken to the appellant personally.

             iii. No confirmation from the doctor  that  the  appellant  was
                  actually there or had seen a doctor.

              iv. Concluded no reasonable excuse to adjourn.

 8. The hearing proceeded by submissions  only  but  after  the  hearing  a
    solicitor's letter accompanied by evidence from the hospital and a copy
    of the prescribed medication slip was submitted. The Tribunal found the
    letter could not be relied on because it was  neither  on  headed  note
    paper nor did it  confirm  the  appellant  was  unwell  to  attend  the
    hearing. The Tribunal concluded  he  had  received  "over  the  counter
    medication" and concluded the original decision to proceed was correct.



 9. The grounds argued the solicitors had been in direct contact  with  the
    appellant contrary to the Tribunal's claim and no  medical  report  was
    produced  because  he  had  not  actually  been  seen  by   a   doctor.
    Confirmation of the appellant's incapacity had been  submitted  and  it
    was submitted the Tribunal had acted unfairly in  refusing  to  adjourn
    the case.

10. Permission to appeal  had  been  given  because  it  was  arguable  the
    Tribunal's  reasons  for  refusing   the   adjournment   were   "wholly
    inadequate" because:

      a. The Tribunal's comments on the notepaper was  unsound  because  the
         style of the note was one commonly presented to the Tribunal.

      b. If the Tribunal had concerns about an absence of information,  then
         it should have given the appellant an opportunity  to  address  any
         concerns about the note and its content.

      c. The Tribunal failed to have regard to the  appellant's  history  of
         attending hearings and the fact he was expected to  attend  by  his
         counsel and there was telephone contact on the day  between  either
         him or his friend and the solicitors.

      d. It was peculiar the Tribunal did not accept the  explanation  given
         by counsel and solicitors.

11. Although a rule 24 response had been filed Miss  Isherwood  stated  she
    had reviewed the evidence and concluded that  there  was  a  procedural
    error in this appeal.

12. In those circumstances I did not require Mr Jaisri to address me and  I
    found there had been an error in law. As there had been no proper  oral
    hearing I indicated to Mr Jaisri that I was minded to remit the  matter
    back to the First-tier Tribunal. In doing so I had regard  to  Part  3,
    Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement.

13. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

         "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement
         Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal to the Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
         Tribunal finds that the making of the decision  concerned  involved
         the making of an error on a point of law, the  Upper  Tribunal  may
         set aside the decision and, if it does so, must  either  remit  the
         case to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)  or
         proceed (in accordance with relevant Practice  Directions)  to  re-
         make the decision under section 12(2)(b)(ii).

         The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed to re-
         make the decision, instead of remitting the case to the  First-tier
         Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:ï¿½

               a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before
                  the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  a  fair  hearing  or  other
                  opportunity for  that  party's  case  to  be  put  to  and
                  considered by the First-tier Tribunal; or

               b) the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is
                  necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-
                  made  is  such  that,  having  regard  to  the  overriding
                  objective in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit  the  case
                  to the First-tier Tribunal.

         Remaking rather than remitting  will  nevertheless  constitute  the
         normal approach to determining appeals where an  error  of  law  is
         found, even if some further fact finding is necessary."

14. In light of the Practice  Direction  whilst  I  had  some  concerns  in
    remitting this matter back to  the  first  Tier  Tribunal  due  to  the
    inherent delays existing in the jurisdiction  at  the  present  time  I
    agreed to remit the matter.

15. It goes without saying that once that date has been fixed the appellant
    should serve on both the tribunal and the respondent an updated  bundle
    of evidence that is to be relied on.

    DECISION

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law. I have set aside the decision.

17. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    appeal  hearing  under  Section  12  of  the  Tribunals,   Courts   and
    Enforcement Act 2007.
