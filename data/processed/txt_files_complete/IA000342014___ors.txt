Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondents are all nationals of Pakistan. They are respectively  a
    mother, father and their two minor children.   On the 29th  April  2014
    the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  OR  Williams)  allowed  their  linked
    appeals against decisions to refuse to vary their leave to  remain  and
    to remove them from the UK under s47  of  the  Immigration  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006. The Secretary of State   now  has  permission  to
    appeal against the Tribunal's decision.


 2. The background to these appeals was that the first appellant before the
    First-tier Tribunal, Ms Imran had been  in  the  United  Kingdom  since
    September 2008 when she entered as a student. Her family had joined her
    in April 2009 as her dependents. In  November  2013  she  had  made  an
    application for further leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepeneur),  her
    husband and children making applications in line as her dependents.  At
    the time that they made those applications they had leave to remain  as
    Tier 1 (Post Study Work) Migrants.

 3. The applications were refused for various reasons, all of which related
    to the specified evidence that Tier 1 (Entrepeneurs)  are  expected  to
    produce.   The refusal letters stated that if  any  of  the  applicants
    wished to remain in the UK on human rights grounds they had to make  an
    application to that effect.


      Determination of the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The First-tier Tribunal found as fact that the appellants before it had
    produced the specified evidence showing Ms Imran to be in possession of
    ï¿½50,000 to invest in the UK, to have registered as  self-employed  with
    HMRC and to have the requisite  level  of  funds  for  maintenance  and
    accommodation. All of these  matters  in  issue  were  resolved  in  Ms
    Imran's favour. It was further found that  she  had  produced  properly
    audited  accounts.  Her  appeal  under  the  Rules   was   nevertheless
    dismissed, since the latter item had only been produced  post-decision;
    the Tribunal was precluded by s85A of the Nationality, Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 from taking that evidence into account.

 5. At paragraph 5 the determination notes that the legal framework on  the
    day was agreed between the parties. Issues (a)-(d)  all  concerned  the
    matters in issue under the Rules and item (e) reads "Article 8 (outside
    of the Rules only)". It was no doubt with this agreed framework in mind
    that the Judge proceeded to consider Article 8 outside  of  the  Rules.
    Paragraph 23 of the determination notes  the  suggestion  that  Gulshan
    [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) is  authority  for  the  proposition  that  the
    Tribunal is somehow prevented from going on to consider human rights in
    an appeal unless there are "compelling  circumstances"  for  so  doing.
    Judge Williams did not accept this proposition. He found  there  to  be
    some inconsistency between that reading of  Gulshan  and  the  guidance
    offered by the Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192
    which specifically approved Izuazu [2013] UKUT 00045  (IAC).  He  noted
    that the appellants before him had raised human rights in their grounds
    of appeal and, in light of the agreed legal framework, went on to apply
    the framework set down in Razgar [2004] UKHL 2 AC 368. Having found the
    decision to remove the family would  have  consequences  of  sufficient
    gravity to engage Article 8 he went on to consider proportionality, and
    resolved this issue in the appellant family's favour, finding that  the
    Secretary of State had not shown the interference to be, in this  case,
    proportionate.




    Grounds of Appeal


 6. The Secretary of State now appeals the decision on the ground that  the
    Tribunal erred in failing to identify whether there were "arguably good
    grounds" for granting leave to remain outside  of  the  Rules.  He  was
    wrong to have contrasted the decision in  Gulshan  with  the  Court  of
    Appeal decision in MF since  the  former  was  promulgated  after  that
    judgement and obviously took it into account.




    Error of Law


 7. I do not find this decision to contain an error such that it should  be
    set aside.


 8. Gulshan never purported to introduce an 'intermediary' test,  threshold
    or gateway to consideration of Article 8. All it did was  to  underline
    the fact that the Secretary of State has now sought to codify,  in  the
    form of the new rules, where, in most cases, the balance will be struck
    between the rights of the migrant and  the  rights  of  the  state.  As
    paragraph 23 of  this  determination  highlights,  the  words  used  in
    Gulshan do not preclude a Tribunal from considering  Article  8  unless
    some "exceptional" feature is identified. All they do is emphasise that
    it is only where the Judge considers Article 8 to be engaged - ie there
    is some compelling circumstance for the applicant-  "is  it  necessary"
    to go on to consider proportionality.  The idea that Gulshan and  Nagre
    should be read to  impose  an  initial  hurdle  has  been  specifically
    rejected by the Court of Appeal in MM and Ors v SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ
    985: "I cannot see much utility in imposing this further, intermediary,
    test. If the applicant cannot satisfy the rule, then there either is or
    there is not a further Article 8 claim. That will have to be determined
    by the relevant decision-maker" per Aikens LJ at 129.

 9.  In  this  case  the  First-tier  Tribunal  has  here  reminded  itself
    repeatedly that the Rules are of great significance in that assessment.
      In assessing proportionality Judge Williams was  careful  to  measure
    against  the  Article  8(1)  rights  of  the   appellant   family   the
    "significant" weight to be attached  to  immigration  control  and  the
    economic well being of the country. He reminded himself that  they  had
    not met the requirements of the rules,  and  that  this  was  important
    because the rules are an expression of where  the  Secretary  of  State
    believes that the balance  should  be  struck.  He  found  that  as  an
    educated and skilled adult Ms  Imran  would  be  able  to  re-establish
    herself in Pakistan; that as migrants on temporary visas the family had
    always understood their position to be precarious and that the children
    were Pakistani nationals who would be able  to  attend  school  and  be
    assisted by their parents  in  their  integration  into  that  country.
    Nonetheless he was satisfied that the Secretary of State could not,  in
    the particular circumstances of  this  family,  show  the  decision  to
    remove to be proportionate. The factors that weighed  in  the  family's
    favour were that the welfare of the  children  demanded  that  they  be
    allowed to remain in the UK  and  not  face  the  disruption  to  their
    education; that the family had always been lawfully resident  and  self
    sufficient, that Ms Imran had some expectation of being on the 'road to
    settlement' because she had latterly been a Tier 1  (Post  Study  Work)
    Migrant an that she had used her time and money to set  up  a  interior
    design business which, on the evidence before the Tribunal, had  "every
    chance of success". Further Ms Imran satisfied that the  Tribunal  that
    her connection with Pakistan was in fact remote: she had been born  and
    raised in Libya and had only ever spent 5 of her 30 years in  Pakistan.
    Finally the Tribunal noted that the appellant family's  solicitors  had
    written to the Respondent as long ago as December  2013  remedying  all
    defects in the original application: the documentation showing that  Ms
    Imran meets the requirements of the Tier 1 Entrepeneur  rules  was  now
    all available.


10. There was nothing wrong with that proportionality  balancing  exercise.
    In fact, the grounds of appeal do  not  suggest  that  there  was.  The
    complaint made is that there was some failure on the part of the  Judge
    to identify a reason to go on to look at Article 8. It  might  be  said
    that the fact that the Judge has found  the  decision  to  actually  be
    disproportionate can be taken as an indication that he considered there
    to be a good reason to go on to consider Article 8.  However as  I  set
    out above, I  do  not  agree  that  this  has  ever  been  the  correct
    interpretation of Gulshan and even if it was,  that  approach  has  now
    been specifically disapproved by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  MM.   The
    Tribunal has given good reasons why it could not find the  decision  to
    remove this family to be proportionate, amongst them that the  children
    are in school and have settled private lives, the mother has little  or
    no connection with the country of her proposed return,  that  they  are
    financially self-sufficient and  importantly  that  they  actually  are
    entrepeneurs, and have shown themselves to meet all of the requirements
    for further leave to remain  in  that  category,  albeit  too  late  to
    satisfy the Secretary of State of that at the date of application.



      Decision

11. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an  error
    of law and it is upheld.
