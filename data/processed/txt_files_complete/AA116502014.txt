 For the Appellant:    Mr R Singer, counsel instructed by S Satha & Co
 For the Respondent:   Mr P Naith, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                         DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


  1. This is an appeal against a decision of FTTJ E B Grant, promulgated on
     11 May 2015, in which she dismissed the appellant's appeal  against  a
     decision to refuse to grant him asylum.















                          ï¿½ CROWN COPYRIGHT 2015





     Background


  2. The appellant unsuccessfully applied for an entry clearance as a  Tier
     4 migrant on 29 December 2009.  A further application was  granted  on
     14 September 2010, valid until 10 August 2011. The  appellant  entered
     the United Kingdom on 3 October 2010. He extended  his  leave  in  the
     same capacity until 31 May 2013, however it was subsequently curtailed
     until 24 May 2012. The appellant sought  asylum  10  July  2014.   The
     basis of his claim, expressed briefly, was that he was wanted owing to
     a bomb being found by the Sri Lankan authorities at his workplace.


  3. During the course of the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal,  the
     appellant did not give evidence as a psychiatric report indicated that
     he was unfit  to  do  so.  A  witness  attended  the  hearing  on  the
     appellant's behalf, a former work colleague who had been recognised as
     a refugee in the United Kingdom.


  4. The FTTJ rejected the appellant's claim in its entirety on credibility
     grounds. She also found  that  the  appellant  could  receive  medical
     treatment in Sri Lanka.


      Error of law


    5. The grounds of appeal submit  that  the  FTTJ  failed  to  take  into
       consideration a significant number  of  subjective  documents  relied
       upon by the appellant; that  the  FTTJ  failed  to  engage  with  the
       medical evidence; there was no  consideration  of  the  risk  to  the
       appellant on return to Sri Lanka in line with paragraph 441-456 of GJ
       & Others and that there was no  or  inadequate  consideration  of  GJ
       generally.


    6. Permission to appeal was granted on 5 June 2015, as it was considered
       arguable that the lack of  reference  to  the  appellant's  documents
       amounted to a material error of  law.  All  grounds  were  considered
       arguable.

    7. The Secretary of State's response of 16 June  2015  stated  that  the
       respondent did not oppose the application for  permission  to  appeal
       with respect to there  being  no  consideration  of  the  documentary
       evidence that the appellant provided. The  Tribunal  was  invited  to
       determine the appeal afresh.


 The hearing


  8. At the outset, Mr Naith confirmed what was said  in  the  respondent's
     reply and that he agreed with Mr Singer that the decision of the  FTTJ
     contained material errors of law. Both  representatives  consented  to
     this matter being remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal  for  a  de
     novo hearing.


  9. As it was we were of the view that the concession was properly made
     because we also considered that the FTTJ had materially erred in her
     failure to have regard to the appellant's substantial quantity of
     subjective evidence, as well as failing to provide reasons for
     rejecting the appellant's account, which was supported by a witness
     who had been granted refugee status on precisely the same facts.

 10. In these circumstances we  were  satisfied  that  there  are  material
     errors of law such that the decision be set aside to be  remade.  None
     of the findings of the FTTJ are to stand.




 11. No anonymity direction was made by the  FTTJ.  In  view  of  sensitive
     aspects of the appellant's case, we consider it  appropriate  to  make
     the following anonymity direction:

        "Pursuant to Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (SI 2008/269) we make an anonymity order. Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings
    or any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly
    identify the original appellant. This  direction  applies  to,  amongst
    others, all parties. Any failure to comply with  this  direction  could
    give rise to contempt of court proceedings. "

 12. Further directions are to follow below.



Conclusions


The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

We set aside the decision to be re-made.







Directions


   . This appeal is remitted to be heard de novo by any First-tier Tribunal
     Judge except FTTJ EB Grant.
   . The appeal should be listed for a hearing at Hatton Cross.
   . A Sri Lankan Tamil interpreter is required.
   . Time estimate is half a day.


 Signed     Date: 1 August 2015
