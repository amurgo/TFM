                               A E ENINAMAWOMA
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, instructed by Latta & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent refused the  appellant  leave  to  remain,  for  reasons
    explained in a decision dated 18 June 2015.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Farrelly dismissed the appellant's appeal for
    reasons explained in his decision promulgated on 6 April 2017.

 3. The one ground of appeal to the UT is as follows:

      Error in finding that the tribunal was not satisfied that it would  be
      in the best interests of the children to remain in the UK.

      The tribunal erred in law at paragraph 16  [by]  failing  to  exercise
      anxious scrutiny and take into account material evidence. The tribunal
      says that the children "are at an age that they can readily  adapt  to
      life [in Nigeria]". In EA v SSHD [2011] UKUT 315 at �41  it  is  noted
      that long residence after the age of  4  is  likely  to  have  greater
      impact on the child. The tribunal failed to fully consider:

    - the proximity of the child's age to the significant age of 7;

    - the fact that she has never left the UK.

      The tribunal therefore also erred in law by failing to  apply  EA.  An
      exercise of anxious scrutiny would have resulted in these factors been
      fully considered together with the subjective evidence lodged.

 4. Mr Winter referred to the decision at �12, which says  that  the  rules
    are designed to be article 8 compliant, and  that  features  justifying
    consideration outside the rules "must be  exceptional".   He  submitted
    that was an error of  legal  approach,  since  illustrated  by  Agyarko
    [2017] UKSC 11.  He further submitted that  at  �15  there  is  another
    error, "The need to consider the best  interests  of  the  children  is
    separate from the proportionality question", was another error, as such
    assessment is well established as an essential part  of  the  exercise,
    and that the errors were material, as on a correct approach,  the  same
    result was not inevitable.

 5. Mr Matthews submitted thus.  The ground of appeal  is  narrowly  drawn.
    There was no reason to think the  tribunal  left  out  of  account  the
    obvious facts before it.  The ground was essentially only a "near miss"
    argument.  In any event, the 7-year mark would not dictate the outcome.
     There had been nothing  to  show  any  significant  detriment  to  the
    children through leaving the UK.  Nothing  said  in  Agyarko  made  the
    appellant's case a better one.  The decision was  consistent  with  the
    case law.  There was no basis on which to interfere.

 6. I reserved my decision.

 7. Agyarko deals with "exceptional circumstances" at �54 - 60.  At �57 the
    Court says that ultimately a tribunal:

      ... has  to  decide  whether  the  refusal  is  proportionate  in  the
      particular case before  it,  balancing  the  strength  of  the  public
      interest in the removal of the person in question against  the  impact
      on private and family life. In doing so, it  should  give  appropriate
      weight to the Secretary of State's policy, expressed in the Rules  and
      the Instructions, that the public interest in immigration control  can
      be outweighed, when considering an application  for  leave  to  remain
      brought by a person in the UK in  breach  of  immigration  laws,  only
      where   there   are   "insurmountable   obstacles"   or   "exceptional
      circumstances" as defined. It must also consider all factors  relevant
      to the specific case  in  question,  including,  where  relevant,  the
      matters discussed in  paras  51-52  above.  The  critical  issue  will
      generally be whether, giving due weight to the strength of the  public
      interest in the removal of the person  in  the  case  before  it,  the
      article 8 claim is sufficiently strong to outweigh it. In general,  in
      cases  concerned  with  precarious  family  life,  a  very  strong  or
      compelling claim is  required  to  outweigh  the  public  interest  in
      immigration control.

 8. It is ever more plain that the word "exceptional" should be avoided  by
    Judges; see this week also Vishal Suri v SSHD, [2017]  CSIH  48,  where
    Lord Glennie, giving the opinion of the Court, said:

      It may be that references to  exceptionality  ...  are  apt  to  over-
      complicate ...  We would suggest that use of that word  in  describing
      the test is better avoided in the future.

 9. That said, every decision which uses the word is not thereby wrong as a
    matter of law.  The test for a case to succeed outside  the  rules  has
    been variously described, with "exceptional" moving in and out  of  the
    definitions, and used in different senses; but the standard for a  case
    to succeed outside the rules has not changed, and remains high.  I  see
    no error of law in the judge's self-direction at �12 which  might  have
    made even a slight difference to his assessment on the facts.

10. The first sentence of �15 is badly put,  but  decisions  must  be  read
    fairly and as a whole.  The judge meant that the best interests of  the
    children had to be assessed independently  from  the  demerits  of  the
    appellant's immigration position, because that is what he proceeded  to
    do.  It is equally plain that he then factored that assessment into the
    proportionality outcome.   Having found no significant detriment to the
    children  through  departure  to  Nigeria,  the  outcome  was  properly
    justified.

11. The above two points do not arise from the ground of appeal, which  is,
    as Mr Matthews pointed out, a narrow one.  It asserts  that  the  facts
    were not considered when they clearly were, and that  case  law  should
    have dictated another outcome,  when  it  did  not.   It  is  simply  a
    disagreement.

12. The judge reached a decision which was open to him, taking  account  of
    the best interests of the children.  It did  not  turn  on  any  subtle
    distinction in the law, but was  firmly  rooted  in  the  facts.    The
    appellant has demonstrated no error  which  would  entitle  the  UT  to
    interfere.

13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

14. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
