                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

   1. The Appellant is a citizen of India born on 22nd of January  1984.  He
      appeals against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hussain
      sitting at  Birmingham  on  26th  of  April  2017  who  dismissed  the
      Appellant's appeal against a decision of the Respondent dated 14th  of
      April 2016. That decision was to refuse  the  Appellant's  application
      for indefinite leave to remain on the basis of long residency pursuant
      to paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules. The Appellant entered  the
      United Kingdom on 19th of July 2004 as a student with leave  to  enter
      valid until 31st of October 2006. This was subsequently extended on  a
      number of occasions until 20th of  April  2016.  Shortly  before  this
      leave was due  to  expire  the  Appellant  made  his  application  for
      indefinite leave to remain the refusal of  which  has  given  rise  to
      these proceedings.


Immigration Rules Relevant to the Appellant


   2. Paragraph 276B sets out  the  requirements  for  an  applicant  to  be
      granted indefinite leave to remain on the grounds of  long  residence.
      An applicant must  have  had  at  least  10  years  continuous  lawful
      residence in the United Kingdom. There must be no reasons why it would
      be undesirable for the applicant to be given leave to remain  on  that
      basis taking into account age, strength of connections to  the  United
      Kingdom, personal history including character, conduct,  associations,
      employment record, domestic circumstances, compassionate circumstances
      and any representations made on the applicant's  behalf.  Further  the
      applicant must not fall for refusal  under  the  general  grounds  for
      refusal.


   3. Paragraph 322(5) is  one  of  the  general  grounds  for  refusal.  It
      provides that applications should normally be refused (thus  providing
      for an element of discretion) where it  is  undesirable  to  permit  a
      person to remain in the United Kingdom in the light of their  conduct,
      character or associations.


Explanation for Refusal


   4. The application was refused because the Appellant had not declared his
      earnings correctly to either the  Respondent  or  HMRC.  The  detailed
      reasons were summarised by the Judge  at  [2]  of  his  determination.
      There had been a review of the Appellant's last  application  made  on
      19th of April  2013  when  the  Appellant  had  submitted  an  in-time
      application for leave to remain as a Tier 1 general migrant which  had
      been granted until 20th of April 2016.  In  that  application  he  had
      shown earnings for the tax year 2012/2013 of �39,161.69.  This  earned
      the Appellant 20 points in the context of his application  but  checks
      carried out with HMRC showed that the  actual  declared  earnings  for
      that same period were only �10,411.73 p. If the Appellant had only had
      the earnings he declared to HMRC he would not  have  obtained  the  20
      points and would not  have  been  granted  leave  to  remain  on  that
      occasion. The Respondent therefore refused the application on  general
      grounds under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.

The Decision at First Instance

   5. The Appellant's case on appeal to the Judge was  that  he  blamed  his
      previous accountants, SJD, an accountancy firm  located  in  Edinburgh
      for under declaring his income to HMRC. He did not  dispute  that  his
      earnings declared for immigration purposes when applying as a  Tier  1
      general migrant were higher  than  those  declared  to  the  HMRC.  He
      provided copies of letters he had written to  SJD  indicating  he  had
      written to them to complain on three occasions. The Judge  noted  that
      the Appellant had  made  no  complaints  against  SJD  either  to  the
      regulatory body or a financial ombudsman.  He  had  not  issued  legal
      proceedings or chased the accountants  for  a  response  to  his  last
      letter (dated 13th of April 2016) even though as the Judge observed at
      [3] that letter was sent more than a year ago. The  Respondent  argued
      that this inaction  undermined  the  credibility  of  the  Appellant's
      complaints about SJD.


 6. The Judge held that this delay was not  in  keeping  with  someone  who
    because of a catastrophic error by his accountants potentially stood to
    lose his hard-sought right to ILR. The Respondent's position  was  that
    either  the  Appellant's  actual  income  was  declared  to   HMRC   or
    alternatively that he had under declared  his  income  for  income  tax
    purposes. Either way the Appellant had tried to deceive the authorities
    and therefore his  application  fell  to  be  refused  under  Paragraph
    322(5).


 7. The Appellant had produced a letter from  his  current  accountants,  a
    company called ORM Accounting Services Ltd, dated 19th of  April  2017.
    They indicated they had been instructed to refile the  Appellant's  tax
    returns for two financial years 2010/2011 and 2012/2013. The tax return
    for 2010/2011 had not figured in the Respondent's refusal but the Judge
    noted at [5] that the contents  of  the  tax  return  for  that  period
    further undermined the Appellant's  case.  This  was  because  the  tax
    return for 2010/2011 also contained an inaccurate declaration of income
    and the rectification resulted in a substantial payment of tax for that
    year in the sum of �6576.59.


 8. The Judge drew the conclusion from this evidence  that  the  additional
    payment of tax for 2010/2011 established a pattern of  the  Appellant's
    conduct of deceiving the authorities which could not  be  laid  at  the
    feet of SJD as they had not been instructed then. The Appellant's claim
    that he had not checked the tax  return  for  2012/2013  filed  on  his
    behalf by SJD was not plausible. He was an employee of a  company  Sree
    Infra Ltd ("SI Ltd") for whom SJD were the corporate  accountants  when
    the 2012/2013 tax return was made. It  was  unlikely  that  accountants
    engaged on behalf of the company would manage the personal tax  returns
    for  the  company's  employees  particularly  where  the  employee   in
    question, the Appellant, was there for less than a year  and  left  the
    company's employment before the end of the tax year in question.


 9. If SJD had filed the Appellant's tax return(s) they would have provided
    the Appellant with copies of his records and it was implausible that he
    had not asked for such copies. No accountants had  been  identified  as
    responsible for the 2010/2011 error. The Judge was satisfied  that  the
    Appellant had deliberately  overinflated  his  income  for  immigration
    purposes alternatively  he  had  under  declared  his  income  for  tax
    purposes. Either way the Appellant fell  foul  of  Rule  322  (5).  The
    Respondent, the Judge held, was right to refuse the application.


The Onward Appeal

  10. The Appellant appealed against this decision  arguing  that  HMRC  had
      accepted the Appellant's amended tax return for  2012/13  without  any
      financial or other penalty being  imposed.  The  Respondent  ought  to
      accept that there had been no deliberate financial deception  employed
      by the Appellant for that period and that an honest mistake  had  been
      made or at least the Appellant should have been given the  benefit  of
      the doubt. The Appellant's income derived from a small  salary  and  a
      larger dividend from his employment. The declaration of income to  the
      Respondent at the time of the Tier 1 application included both  salary
      and  dividend  payments  whereas  the  tax  return  for  2012/13   had
      erroneously only showed the income from his salary.


  11.  The Respondent had drawn the conclusion that the Appellant  had  been
      dishonest but this failed to take proper account of a letter from  SJD
      which stated that  the  Appellant  was  both  a  director  and  a  50%
      shareholder of SI Ltd and took both  dividends  and  salary  from  the
      company. When SJD filed the Appellant's tax  return  they  omitted  to
      include the dividend payments made to  the  Appellant.  That  was  the
      basis of the Appellant's complaint  about  them  and  why  he  engaged
      another firm of accountants (ORM) to handle his financial affairs.


  12. The Respondent had not refused the application under any of the  other
      sections of paragraph 322. The Judge had  omitted  to  show  that  the
      Appellant's letter to the complaints manager at SJD  bore  a  recorded
      delivery slip and should be taken as evidence of  posting.  The  Judge
      had made findings against the Appellant in relation to the tax  return
      for 2010/11 even though that  had  been  not  raised  in  the  refusal
      letter. The Appellant was not cross-examined about the matter  by  the
      presenting officer or the Judge. The new accountants had  submitted  a
      tax return for the period 2010/11 which had resulted in  a  notice  of
      amended assessment on 20th of May 2016.


  13.  The Appellant  had  demonstrated  his  diligence  and  ability  being
      awarded  degrees  in  Bachelor  of  Engineering  and  Electronics  and
      Communications Engineering on 8th of September 2005, Master of Science
      in Computer and Network Engineering on 15th  of  October  2008  and  a
      certified tester at foundation level on 6th of  August  2011.  He  may
      have been financially na�ve in not  checking  his  financial  and  tax
      affairs closely enough but he  was  not  dishonest.  The  decision  to
      refuse the Appellant's application  for  ILR  did  not  demonstrate  a
      proper exercise of the Respondent's discretion.


  14. The application for permission to appeal came initially  before  Judge
      of the First-tier Tribunal Mailer on 13th of November 2017. He refused
      permission to appeal stating  that  the  Appellant's  lengthy  grounds
      merely sought to re-argue the case. Even though  the  Judge's  finding
      that there was no evidence of posting letters of complaint to SJD  was
      unsafe the Judge had also noted that the Appellant had written to them
      on three occasions but made no complaints  against  them  nor  had  he
      chased the firm for a response to his last letter even though that was
      sent more than a year before. The First-tier Judge  had  undertaken  a
      detailed and careful assessment of the evidence and his findings  were
      not outside a range of reasonable responses to the evidence.


  15. The Appellant renewed his application  for  permission  to  appeal  on
      seven grounds. The 1st dealt with the  issue  of  the  certificate  of
      posting of the 3rd complaint letter written by the Appellant  to  SJD.
      The  Judge's  incorrect  conclusion  that  the  letters  of  complaint
      produced by the Appellant were likely to be fabricated  as  they  were
      not accompanied by any proof of  posting  was  bound  to  lead  to  an
      adverse view of the Appellant's credibility generally.


  16. The 2nd ground argued that  the  Judge  should  have  made  a  finding
      whether the Appellant did or  did  not  deliberately  overinflate  his
      income for immigration  purposes  and  should  have  made  a  separate
      finding whether the  Appellant  under  declared  his  income  for  tax
      purposes. An under declaration of income to the Inland Revenue was not
      necessarily a deliberate falsehood. It might be an honest error or  an
      oversight by the taxpayer or his accountant.


  17. The 3rd ground argued that  it  would  be  surprising  for  a  working
      graduate IT specialist to be only earning �10,411.73  per  annum,  the
      amount declared to HMRC, as that was less than the minimum wage.


  18. The 4th ground argued that the Judge had failed to take notice of  the
      fact that being self-employed through a controlled company was  highly
      tax efficient because of the lower tax rates on dividends.  The  under
      declaration to HMRC by the Appellant only resulted in an adjustment of
      �91.20 a very small sum. It was far-fetched to suggest  the  Appellant
      had deliberately made a false declaration to avoid  paying  this  sum.
      This aspect of the case had not been considered at all  by  the  Judge
      and it was likely that a miscarriage of justice had  occurred  in  the
      attribution of deliberate deception to the Appellant by the Respondent
      in  relation  to  this  sum.  That  this  underpayment  was  so  small
      undermined the adverse inference drawn by the Judge from  the  failure
      of the Appellant to complain to the regulatory body against SJD.


  19.  The 5th ground argued it was wrong for  the  Judge  to  rely  on  the
      Appellant's 2010/ 2011 tax return as that had not been the basis of or
      even mentioned in the refusal letter. The fact that the Appellant  had
      also applied for an amended assessment for that period  only  came  to
      light because it was disclosed through the accidental inclusion of the
      amended notice of assessment in the Appellant's hearing bundle.


  20.  The 6th ground argued in the alternative to the 5th ground  that  the
      2010/2011  amended  tax  return  did  not  in  fact  show   deliberate
      deception. The adjustment in relation to that period was �5825.08  but
      this included late payment interest for a period of 4 years from  2012
      to 2016 which must have formed a substantial  part  of  that  sum.  An
      allegation of deception had to be  proved  the  high  civil  standard.
      Given the very small amount of the underpayment in 2012/2013  and  the
      uncertainty over the amount  of  the  underpayment  in  2010/2011  any
      reasonable Tribunal should conclude that accident or carelessness  was
      more likely than deception in relation to the 2010/2011  underpayment.
      The 7th ground argued that it was wrong to categorise a person who had
      made an under payment of an unknown but relatively small amount of tax
      as being a person whose removal was conducive to the public good.


  21. In a brief decision on 18th of January 2018 Upper Tribunal Judge  Blum
      granted permission  to  appeal  stating  that  given  that  there  was
      evidence that the Appellant had posted his complaint to  his  previous
      accountant it was arguable that the First-tier  Judge  had  failed  to
      take account of relevant evidence. Judge  Blum  saw  little  merit  in
      ground 7 but he was persuaded that the other grounds which  criticised
      the Judge's approach to the issue of deception were arguable.

The Hearing Before Me

  22. At the hearing before me counsel for the Appellant sought to amend the
      grounds of onward appeal by enlarging on  the  7th  ground  for  which
      permission to appeal had not been granted. This sought to  argue  that
      the refusal of the Appellant's application requiring him to leave  the
      United Kingdom was a disproportionate restriction of his  right  to  a
      private life under Article 8.  The  refusal  letter  had  stated  that
      consideration had been given to whether  the  Appellant's  application
      for leave to remain  raised  any  exceptional  circumstances  but  the
      letter had stopped there and the result of the consideration  had  not
      been stated. The amended ground sought to  argue  that  there  was  no
      doubt that requiring the Appellant to leave the country where  he  had
      lived for the previous 12 years engaged Article 8.


  23. In refusing the application to amend the grounds to argue this point I
      indicated to the parties that the Judge  had  specifically  stated  at
      [11] that the only issue that the parties had  required  him  to  deal
      with was whether the Appellant had or had not been  dishonest  in  his
      declarations to the HMRC and the Respondent. Article 8  had  not  been
      raised as  a  separate  issue.  This  was  confirmed  by  the  Judge's
      manuscript note of the case which was on the court file  which  showed
      that at the outset of the hearing before the Judge on  26th  of  April
      2017 the solicitor for the Appellant had stated that the  "only  issue
      [was] false returns by former accountants he has rectified the matter.
      Only issue is credibility of the Appellant." Article 8  had  not  been
      raised before the Judge and I therefore refused  permission  to  amend
      the grounds of appeal to argue that point.


  24. In oral submissions counsel relied on the remainder of his grounds,  1
      to 6. In relation to ground 1, mistake as to proof of posting  of  the
      letter of complaint, it was argued that page  15  of  the  Appellant's
      bundle had the number of the recorded delivery  slip  which  had  been
      overlooked by the Judge. That  the  Appellant  could  corroborate  his
      claim to have sent a letter of complaint to the accountants would,  if
      understood correctly, have impacted on  the  Judge's  other  findings.
      Ground  two,  failure  to  differentiate  between  deception  of   the
      Respondent and HMRC, complained that the Judge's finding at [11]  that
      the  Appellant  either  deliberately  overinflated  his   income   for
      immigration purposes or under declared his income to HMRC was too much
      of a broad-brush approach.


  25. The Appellant relied on the Upper Tribunal decision of  JC  [2007]  UK
      AIT 27 that in relation to the general grounds contained in part 9  of
      the Immigration Rules (which includes the relevant paragraph  in  this
      case, 322 (5)) the  burden  of  proof  rested  on  the  Respondent  to
      establish any contested precedent fact. This included the obtaining of
      previous leave to enter or remain by deception. It was incumbent  upon
      the decision maker to say what it was  that  the  Appellant  had  done
      wrong. It was too much of a leap to say that because  the  Appellant's
      tax returns were inaccurate he had defrauded HMRC or  the  Respondent.
      Something more than just an underpayment of tax needed to be shown  to
      demonstrate deception.


  26. As to ground 3, the failure to have regard to the evidence as  to  the
      deception and the earnings of the  Appellant,  given  the  Appellant's
      qualifications it would be unlikely that he would be working below the
      minimum wage. He was therefore telling the  truth  when  he  said  his
      accountant had only declared the salary he received. Ground 4 was that
      the underpayment of �91.20 p was so small because the tax due  on  the
      dividends had already been deducted by the company.


  27. Ground 5 complained that it was wrong for reliance to be placed on the
      Appellant's 2010/2011 tax return. I queried with counsel  how  it  was
      that the Judge had come into possession of that tax return and whether
      once it was before the Judge he was entitled to  ask  questions  about
      it. Counsel replied that the  tax  return  had  not  been  before  the
      Respondent and it was procedurally unfair to draw conclusions from it.
      There had been no prosecution of the Appellant in relation to the 2011
      tax return. In the alternative was ground 6 that  the  tax  return  of
      2010/2011 did not show deliberate deception. The Appellant would bring
      a considerable public benefit to this country by being  granted  leave
      to remain here. The Respondent did not prove misconduct.


  28. In response the Presenting  Officer  indicated  that  the  Appellant's
      grounds for all their length  were  simply  a  disagreement  with  the
      findings of the First-tier Tribunal. Although  there  was  a  recorded
      delivery slip stuck onto the April 2016 letter such slips were readily
      obtainable from any post office and importantly there was no  evidence
      of delivery of that recorded delivery letter. That the  Appellant  had
      not complained to the regulatory body of the financial ombudsman was a
      significant point made by the Judge. The determination was  sound  and
      should be left to stand.


  29.  In  response  counsel  argued  that  the  Appellant  was  not  simply
      disagreeing with the Judge, there were relevant matters to  which  the
      Tribunal did not have regard. This was  not  a  borderline  situation.
      There was no reason why the Appellant should have written  letters  of
      complaint to the regulatory body because  the  underpayment  was  only
      �91, that was not a catastrophic error as the  Judge  had  put  it.  I
      queried whether it had been argued at first instance that there was no
      need for the Appellant to  complain  about  his  accountant's  actions
      because the underpayment was only �91. Counsel did  not  refer  me  to
      anything specific but reiterated that at [3] of the determination  the
      Judge had referred to the fact that the Appellant did not dispute that
      his earnings for immigration purposes were higher than those  declared
      to the HMRC. At the conclusion of submissions, I reserved my  decision
      on the issue of a material error of law  which  I  now  give  in  this
      determination.

Findings

  30. The burden of proof in this case was on the  Respondent  to  establish
      that the Appellant came within the provisions of paragraph 322 (5)  of
      the Immigration Rules. If the Appellant did come within that paragraph
      (and discretion should not be exercised in  his  favour)  it  followed
      that the Appellant would fall for refusal under the  general  grounds.
      That in turn would mean that he would not be  able  to  succeed  under
      paragraph 276B of the rules even if he could show 10 years  continuous
      lawful residence in the United Kingdom.


  31. Paragraph 322 (5) refers  to  the  undesirability  of  permitting  the
      person concerned to remain in the United Kingdom in the light of their
      conduct, character or associations. The conduct complained of was that
      the Appellant had said one thing to the Home Office when  applying  in
      an earlier application for leave to remain and a very different  thing
      to HMRC when he had to declare his income for tax  purposes.  For  the
      tax year 2012/2013 the Appellant had  declared  income  of  �10,411.73
      whereas for the same period when applying to the Respondent for  leave
      to remain he had stated that he had previous earnings  of  �39,161.69.
      That covered the period 1st of June 2012 to 31st of March 2013 and not
      1st of April 2012 to 31st of  March  2013  and  related  to  when  the
      Appellant started with the employer SI Limited.


  32. The two figures given to HMRC and the Home Office  were  clearly  very
      different and inevitably aroused suspicion. While the burden of  proof
      was on the Respondent the discrepancy required some  explanation.  The
      standard of proof is the civil standard of  balance  of  probabilities
      but the more serious the allegation the more cogent needs  to  be  the
      evidence that supports it. The Judge  did  not  find  the  Appellant's
      explanation that it was all the fault of SJD to be credible. He relied
      on two factors for finding dishonesty. Firstly, the Appellant had made
      very little of his complaint against SJD in terms of not following  up
      letters of complaint assuming he had written them  at  all.  Secondly,
      another  tax  return  disclosed  by  the  Appellant,  accidentally  or
      otherwise, showed that the  Appellant  had  also  under  declared  his
      income to HMRC for an earlier tax year before he  had  instructed  the
      accountants about whom he was now complaining.


  33. The Judge's view was that this indicated a pattern of behaviour by the
      Appellant of not informing HMRC of his true earnings. The  Appellant's
      appeal against  the  Judge's  decision  seeks  to  minimise  what  the
      Appellant has done by stating that he is not been  prosecuted  by  the
      Inland Revenue for the under declaration. I do not consider  that  any
      weight attaches to that argument, the issue is not  whether  HMRC  has
      prosecuted the Appellant the issue is whether the Appellant told  HMRC
      the truth. The 2nd argument the Appellant makes is that  even  if  the
      Appellant did under declare his income to  HMRC,  when  it  was  fully
      declared and because a lot  of  tax  had  already  been  paid  on  the
      undeclared income it did not result in very  much  of  a  further  tax
      payment.


  34. I do not consider that argument carries much weight either. The  issue
      is not one of a de minimis breach of the Immigration Rules  rather  it
      is a question of the state of mind of  the  Appellant.  As  the  Judge
      pointed out before the tax return in question could have been sent  to
      the Inland Revenue it would  have  had  to  have  been  shown  to  the
      Appellant for his approval. He knew that the return was either correct
      and he had lied to the Respondent or was wrong and  he  was  deceiving
      HMRC. There is nothing to indicate that the Appellant thought he would
      have to pay next to no tax on a sum as large as �30,000  approximately
      and therefore was not bothering to declare it. This argument  was  not
      raised at first instance and has  only  come  into  existence  in  the
      grounds of onward appeal.


  35. The letters of complaint to SJD, by contrast, stated  that  "it  later
      became transparent" to the Appellant that the correct information  was
      not submitted to HMRC. The Judge did not believe that explanation that
      the Appellant only found out about the under  declaration  later,  for
      the reasons he gave (that the Appellant would have seen the tax return
      etc). I am bound to say that nothing was said to me in argument  which
      dealt with that central concern of the Judge. The Judge was  sceptical
      about whether the Appellant had really complained about SJD not  least
      because of the lack of follow-up when SJD did not  reply.  That  still
      left the issue of how it was that the incorrect tax return could  have
      gone off to HMRC. No satisfactory explanation was given to  the  Judge
      and nothing was said in submissions to me that dealt with the lack  of
      follow up. Whether or not the Judge ought to have  inferred  that  the
      letters were not sent (given the lack of  evidence  that  the  letters
      were actually delivered) is in  any  event  less  important  than  the
      failure by the Appellant to follow  up  his  complaint,  this  is  the
      inaction referred to by the Respondent and cited at [3].  [3]  of  the
      determination certainly does not cause the Judge's adverse credibility
      findings to unravel as claimed in the grounds of onward appeal.


  36. Assuming that the third letter of complaint dated 13th of  April  2016
      was a genuine letter written to SJD it does not appear from the  tenor
      of that letter that the Appellant regarded the matter as so trivial he
      need not take it any further. He very much  made  the  point  in  that
      letter that he had been unable to secure his immigration status in the
      United Kingdom. The Judge had used the word catastrophic  to  describe
      this situation the Appellant found himself in. On the Appellant's case
      it was a serious error by SJD. The argument that it was such  a  small
      breach it was not worth pursuing to the regulatory  body  is  not  one
      which I consider has any weight at all.


  37. The Judge was criticised for his finding in the alternative at [11] of
      his  determination  that  either  the   Appellant   had   deliberately
      overinflated his income for immigration purposes or under declared his
      income to HMRC. The Appellant's argument appears to be that there  was
      an under declaration of income to HMRC. It would have been speculation
      on the Judge's part for him to have concluded that the  Appellant  had
      committed one or the other default thereby indicating that  the  other
      amount in question was correct. The point was that there  had  been  a
      default, the two figures the one submitted to the Respondent the other
      to HMRC sharply differed and there was no reasonable  explanation  why
      that should be. The Appellant needed to  know  why  he  had  lost  the
      appeal and the Judge gave cogent reasons why that should be so.


  38. It was also argued that the Judge  had  been  procedurally  unfair  in
      considering the tax return for 2010/2011 because  that  had  not  been
      considered by the  Respondent,  as  the  Judge  himself  noted.  Under
      certain  Immigration  Rule  based  applications  only   the   evidence
      submitted at the time  of  application  can  be  considered  and  post
      application evidence is not admissible. The issue here  was  a  rather
      different one since what was  being  alleged  by  the  Respondent  was
      dishonesty on the part of the Appellant. In those circumstances  there
      was an obligation on the Tribunal to  consider  all  relevant  matters
      since it would  be  highly  unfair  to  an  Appellant  faced  with  an
      allegation of dishonesty who had exculpatory evidence to be told  that
      evidence could not be put in to the Tribunal because it had  not  been
      submitted at the  time  of  the  application.  Section  85(4)  of  the
      Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provides that the Tribunal
      may take into account all evidence relevant to the decision  including
      matters  arising  after  the  date  of  decision,  in  this  case  the
      disclosure by the Appellant of his 2010/2011 tax return. at  the  date
      of hearing.


  39. There was nothing procedurally  unfair  about  the  Judge  considering
      evidence which had been submitted by the Appellant himself.  That  the
      evidence did not assist the Appellant's case was hardly the  fault  of
      the Tribunal. It was a  matter  for  the  Judge  whether  to  draw  an
      inference that the Appellant had a  history  of  under  declaring  his
      income to HMRC. The evidence pointed in that direction and it was open
      to him to make such a finding. Although the Appellant  argues  it  was
      unfair to refer to the tax return in the determination  no  reasonable
      explanation has been given at any stage, including in  submissions  to
      me, to explain how it was that the Appellant underdeclared his  income
      for 2010/2011. The Appellant on his case has had to pay a  significant
      amount  of  penalty  interest  indicating  some  wrong  doing  on  the
      Appellant's behalf. The Judge rightly took this evidence which was  in
      effect an admission of  previous  wrong  doing  into  account  in  his
      overall assessment of the Appellant's honesty.


  40.   No good reason was given why the Appellant had  under  declared  his
      income to HMRC and the facts spoke for themselves. The  Appellant  had
      been able to state a figure to the Respondent and thus  was  aware  of
      what his claimed earnings were said to be for the relevant period. The
      Appellant had a history of under declaring  his  income  to  HMRC  and
      having to pay what may have been substantial interest  as  a  penalty.
      There was ample evidence of dishonesty on the part of  the  Appellant.
      His attempts to either blame his accountants SJD (when  they  had  not
      been responsible for the problem with the 2010/2011 tax return) and or
      to minimise the extent of his default with the HMRC do not assist  the
      matter. There was no merit in the argument that  HMRC  ought  to  have
      suspected that the Appellant was earning too little for someone of his
      abilities. There is no reason at all why HMRC should have assumed that
      a tax payer was under declaring his income or  that  he  ought  to  be
      earning more. This argument does the Appellant no credit.


  41. The Judge found that  the  Respondent  had  exercised  her  discretion
      correctly in deciding that paragraph 322(5) applied and there  was  no
      material error of law in such a finding. For all  the  length  of  the
      grounds in this case they amount to no more than a  disagreement  with
      the decision of the Judge. As such they do not disclose  any  material
      error of law and I dismiss the Appellant's appeal against the decision
      of the First-tier Tribunal.


Notice of Decision

    error of law and I uphold  the  decision  to  dismiss  the  Appellant's
    appeal

Appellant's appeal dismissed

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.
