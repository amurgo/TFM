                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Cameroon, born on 10 September 1981.  His
    case arises under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.

 2. The SSHD made a decision dated 17 December 2019.  This describes itself
    as the refusal of an "application made  on  16  September  2019  for  a
    permanent residence card as a retained right after divorce  to  confirm
    that you are the former family member of EEA national Neline Atteh, who
    was exercising treaty rights in the UK".


 3. (That may not be an accurate description of the application  made;  but
    neither party has provided a copy of it.)

 4. The SSHD's decision refuses  the  application  on  the  view  that  the
    appellant was married to Neline  Atteh  from  28  November  2009  until
    dissolution by a decree absolute on 27 June 2012, a period of 2 years 7
    months, which fell short of the 3 years required by the regulations for
    a retained right of residence after divorce.

 5. The SSHD rejected the assertion, raised by implication from some of the
    documents provided by the appellant, that he remained married to Neline
    Atteh.

 6. The SSHD declined to consider other evidence relating to the  appellant
    and to Neline Atteh (which, presumably, was designed to show that other
    requirements of the regulations were met) on the view that the duration
    of the marriage for less than 3 years was decisive.

 7. The SSHD advised the appellant that he had a right of appeal,  or  that
    he might apply again, if he had further evidence  (which,  if  he  does
    have a case, might have been the more sensible course).

 8. The appellant filed an appeal to the FtT, asking for a decision "on the
    papers".  With his grounds he produced a copy  of  a  decision  by  FtT
    James in appeal EA/04087/17, promulgated on 5 June 2018.  This  was  an
    appeal against refusal of a residence card as a  former  spouse.    The
    FtT found for the appellant on the issue of producing a  passport,  but
    dismissed his appeal because he  had  not  produced  evidence  to  show
    compliance with the regulations.

 9. In his appeal to the FtT in this case, the appellant  also  produced  a
    copy of decision of the Family Court at Luton on 11 March 2016, setting
    aside his  divorce;  "evidence  of  exercising  treaty  rights  for  my
    estranged  wife  and  myself",  although  without  any   comprehensible
    statement of  how  the  evidence  served  to  meet  the  terms  of  the
    regulations; and evidence  that  he  had  petitioned  for  divorce,  in
    ongoing proceedings.

10. FtT Kaler dismissed the appellant's appeal by a decision promulgated on
    16 April 2020.  The judge considered  the  case  under  regulation  10;
    found at [15] that the order of 11  March  2016  "did  not  change  the
    position"; at [16], that the  evidence  was  inadequate  to  show  that
    Neline Atteh  exercised  treaty  rights  between  2008  and  2013,  her
    earnings were very low, and  her  work  was  "marginal  and  ancillary"
    rather than "genuine and effective"; at [17], that he had not shown  he
    had resided with her for at least a  year  during  the  course  of  the
    marriage; at [18], that he had not shown that she was exercising treaty
    rights up to 2013 or when the new divorce proceedings  were  commenced;
    and at [19] that he was not entitled to a residence card "as the former
    spouse of an EEA national who was exercising treaty rights" or "as  the
    spouse of an EEA national who is or was exercising treaty rights at the
    relevant time".


11. The appellant applied for permission to appeal to the UT.  His  grounds
    raise two main points:- (i) as he remains married, his case should have
    been considered under regulation 15 not regulation 10, and (ii) the FtT
    erred in its findings on Neline Atteh's earnings and exercise of treaty
    rights.

12. FtT Judge L Murray granted permission on 8 June 2020, on the view  that
    Judge Kaler arguably erred in holding that the Family Court order of 11
    March 2016 did not change the position, and by dealing  with  the  case
    under regulation 10 rather than regulation 15.

13. The grant of permission says nothing about the second issue  raised  in
    the grounds.

14. The UT issued directions on 17 September 2020 with a view  to  deciding
    without a hearing (a) whether the FtT erred  in  law  and  (b)  if  so,
    whether its decision should be set aside.  Parties were also given  the
    opportunity to submit on whether there should be a hearing.

15. There is no response on file from the SSHD.

16. The appellant on 30 September 2020 filed copies of various materials.

17. Neither party has asked for a hearing.

18. In all the circumstances, the UT may now proceed, in terms of  rules  2
    and 34, to decide (a) and (b) above without a hearing.

19. The FtT held, rather baldly and without giving any  reasons,  that  the
    Family Court order of 11 March 2016 did not change the  position.   The
    FtT did not have the benefit of reasoned submissions  on  either  side,
    and nor does the UT; but the order, on its face, plainly did change the
    position, to the effect that the marriage had not ceased to exist.

20. If the case fell under regulation 15, the appellant had  to  show  that
    Neline Atteh had "resided in the  United  Kingdom  in  accordance  with
    these regulations for a continuous period of five years".

21. The papers filed by the appellant with the UT contain  a  sheet  marked
    "estranged wife proof of treaty rights 2008 - 2013".  This is  followed
    by a tax calculation for the year 2008 - 2009,  income  �3887.00;   tax
    certificate 2009 - 2010, income �7071.81;  a copy of  one  page  of  an
    application for  jobseekers'  allowance  on  12/1/11;  notification  of
    pregnancy and maternity leave to be taken from  24/1/11;  and  payslips
    for two weeks, to 25/12/11 and to 26/12/12.  This  appears  to  be  the
    same evidence as was filed with the FtT.

22. The FtT concluded that the appellant had not shown  that  Neline  Atteh
    had resided in the United Kingdom in accordance with these  regulations
    for a continuous period of five years.   If there had been  only  minor
    gaps, the FtT might have made an inference in the  appellant's  favour;
    but the evidence did not  come  close  to  covering  the  full  period.
    Nothing in the appellant's grounds, submissions or evidence shows  that
    the FtT's conclusion involved the making of an error on a point of law.



23. The appellant disagrees with the FtT's conclusion that the earnings  of
    his spouse  were  very  low,  and  that  her  work  was  "marginal  and
    ancillary" rather than "genuine and effective"; but he  also  does  not
    show that conclusion to be affected by any error on a point of law.

24. On either or both of those  issues,  the  appeal  was  bound  to  fail,
    whether considered under regulation 10 or under regulation 15.

25. I therefore find that any error by the FtT was not such as  to  require
    its decision to be set aside.  Alternatively, if the decision  were  to
    be remade, the appeal would again be dismissed.

26. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
