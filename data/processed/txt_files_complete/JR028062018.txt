                    ON AN APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW

                              APPROVED JUDGMENT
                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -


    JUDGE rintoul: The applicant challenges the decision made on 31 January
    2018 to refuse to grant  her  indefinite  leave  to  enter  the  United
    Kingdom, but instead to grant her 30 months' leave to remain under  the
    Immigration Rules subject to her prohibition on accessing public funds.
     It is I think necessary to set out some of the history  of  this  case
    before going on to consider the issues raised and  to  go  through  the
    history of the applications made by the applicant  and  indeed  by  her
    husband which are relevant to the applicant's case.


 2. The applicant arrived in the United Kingdom in 2002 with a visit  visa.
    She did not return home and entered into a relationship with a Mr Aidoo
    who was in 2011 granted Discretionary Leave to Remain, primarily  as  a
    result of his relationship with a daughter by someone  other  than  the
    applicant.  The applicant herself made  an  application  for  leave  to
    remain on a human rights basis and eventually she was, on 4 July  2014,
    granted leave to remain.  I will come in a minute to the basis on which
    that was granted.


 3. Towards the end of that leave expiring, that is,  leave  being  granted
    both to her husband and to her children, for a period of three years to
    expire on 4 July 2014, the  applicant  applied  for  leave.  There  was
    subsequent to that a judicial review application challenging the  terms
    of the restriction on public funds put  on  the  applicant's  leave  to
    remain which was resolved by way of consent order.  It is sufficient to
    mention at this point that  it  was  raised  in  the  grounds  of  that
    application that the applicant's case was that  she  had  been  granted
    leave to remain on the same basis as her then husband.


 4. By way of background it, it should be  recalled,  and  this  is  not  a
    matter of dispute between the parties, that prior to 9 July 2012  there
    was in place a policy regarding Discretionary Leave to Remain.  This in
    broad terms set out that Discretionary Leave to Remain would be granted
    to those whose removal from the United Kingdom, although they  did  not
    meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules, would nonetheless be in
     breach of their Article 8 rights primarily on account  of  family  and
    also private life.


 5. In addition to this there was at the time a policy  whereby  those  who
    did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules and did not meet
    the Discretionary Leave policy  could  be  granted  leave  outside  the
    Rules.  That position, as both parties accept, changed on 9  July  2012
    with the introduction of Appendix FM.  At that point the  greater  part
    of those granted Discretionary Leave to Remain then acquired  leave  on
    the ten-year route or some other route under Appendix FM  or  paragraph
    276ADE of the Rules.  The leave outside the Rules policy continued  but
    in a different format.


 6. I turn then to what is in issue in this case.  The applicant's case  is
    put primarily on several inter-related bases.  That is first that there
    was a grant to her of Discretionary  Leave  within  the  terms  of  the
    policy that applied to her husband; further, that that  was  in  effect
    backdated, such that it is deemed to have begun in which  there  was  a
    grant of Discretionary Leave to her husband, that is on 4 July 2011.


 7. In the alternative it is put that even if there  was  not  a  grant  of
    Discretionary Leave that the applicant had  a  legitimate  expectation,
    both that she had been granted leave to remain in line with her husband
    ( meaning that it has been deemed to have begun at the same time as the
    leave granted to her husband),  and  also  that  she  could  apply  for
    Indefinite Leave to Remain in the terms of that policy once six  years'
    Discretionary Leave had elapsed, that is either if it is dated back  to
    the husband in 2017 or, in the alternative, that it would be in 2020.


 8. I turn first to the question of whether there was in fact  a  grant  of
    leave in 2011.  I conclude there was no grant of leave to the applicant
    in 2011.  That is because, as the case law to which Mr Malik  took  me,
    Rafiq v SSHD [1988] Imm IR 193 and also Secretary of  State  v  Ahmadi,
    [2012] EWCA Civ 512 makes it clear  that  it  is  the  notification  in
    writing which is the operative instrument in the grant of  leave.   The
    grant of leave flows from that.  I consider equally that it  must  flow
    from that, but unless there is something said to the contrary, that  it
    must be that the leave applies from that date,  that  is  the  date  of
    grant of leave.  I accept that there may well  be  the  odd  exception,
    whereby for example a notice of leave is granted and  expressly  stated
    to backdate to a specific date if, for example, there had been an error
    in a previous grant.  It follows from this that I do not accept  either
    of the first two arguments put by the applicant, firstly that there was
    a grant of leave in 2011, or that the effect of the grant in  2014  was
    retrospective.


 9. Turning next to the grant from 2014 I note  the  argument  put  by  the
    applicant relating to the phrase used "in line with".  It is  important
    to consider carefully the context of and how  the  different  decisions
    made in 2014 are expressed.  The decisions were set out under cover  of
    a letter of 18 September 2014 covering both the applicant's husband and
    the applicant and three dependent children.  The letter to the  husband
    is very clearly stated as grant of discretionary leave to  remain.   It
    states in terms:-


         "although you do not qualify for leave  to  remain  in  the  United
         Kingdom under  the  Immigration  Rules,  it  has  nonetheless  been
         decided that discretion should be exercised in  your  favour.   You
         have therefore been granted limited leave to remain in  the  United
         Kingdom in accordance with the  principles  set  out  in  the  Home
         Office Policy Instruction on Discretionary Leave.   You  have  been
         granted Discretionary Leave to remain until 18  September  2017  on
         the basis of your family life."


10. I pause to recall that the Discretionary Leave Policy had by that point
    been changed but contained a transitionary  provision,  such  that  the
    current policy states in summary that those granted discretionary leave
    prior to 9 July 2012 will continue to be granted Discretionary Leave to
    Remain  in  the  same  terms  unless  there  has  been  a   change   in
    circumstances or there has been an element of criminality.


11. The letter then goes on to state "Entitlements", "Dependants",  answers
    questions about biometric residence permits and, insofar as  it  refers
    to applying for an extension, it says:-


         "Any  application  will  be  considered  in  the   light   of   the
         circumstances prevailing at that time.


         Where an extension of Discretionary Leave is  sought,  the  request
         will be subject to an active review.   A  person  will  not  become
         eligible for settlement  until  they  have  completed  6  years  of
         Discretionary Leave."


    That again is an indication that this grant of leave was made  in  line
    with the policy. It also says finally that the application form DL must
    be used.


12. In contrast the letter to the applicant says:-


         "Consideration has been given outside the Immigration Rules and due
         to your particular circumstances it has been decided to grant you a
         period of leave outside the rules on an exceptional basis."


13. The letter also records that the applicant is not  entitled  to  public
    funds. In addressing future applications the letter makes none  of  the
    statements made in regard to her husband referred to above.   I  accept
    that the phrase "in line with" has been used in respect of one  of  the
    letters, it being said "in line with  your  husband".   There  are  two
    possibilities to be considered there: one, "in line with" refers simply
    to the length, that is the  situation  in  which  two  people  who  had
    previously had leave to remain  for  different  periods  which  do  not
    coincide and then became in a relationship that it is "in line" that it
    is the length which it is in line with; or, as Miss Bond contends,  "in
    line with" goes wider than that and says that it is on the same  basis,
    that is a grant of leave in the same quality.  I do not accept, and  on
    the facts of this case that the latter  could  apply,  given  that  the
    latter is certainly, as early as 18 September 2014, make it clear  that
    the grant of leave is on different terms.  Not only do the letters  say
    different things, it gives the husband discretionary leave, in the case
    of the applicant, leave outside the Rules, but the conditions are  said
    to be different and different things are  said  about  when  indefinite
    leave to remain can be applied for, there being simply  no  mention  of
    that in respect of the applicant.


14. A question then arises, was there any  legitimate  expectation  on  the
    part of the applicant, such that she could have thought  that  she  was
    entitled  either  that  she  had,  or  would  be  treated   as   having
    Discretionary  Leave  and  that  she  could  make  an  application  for
    Indefinite Leave to Remain once six years have elapsed?


15. Whilst Mr Malik took me to the  provisions  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    which make it clear that the general period is 30 months and Miss  Bond
    points out quite fairly that the initial grant of leave  from  2014  to
    2017 was of three years, I do not consider that that  is  a  sufficient
    basis to show any legitimate expectation.  Further, I do  not  consider
    that the fact that the issue of the quality or basis of the applicant's
    leave being raised in judicial review proceedings challenging  the  "no
    recourse to public funds" endorsement could be construed  as  assisting
    the applicant.  I do not see any basis on which it could be said it was
    in those circumstances incumbent on the Secretary of State to  disabuse
    the applicant of that part of her case.   The  case  was,  it  appears,
    settled on a different basis and there is not before me any  indication
    of what was discussed between the parties in forms  and  correspondence
    or any agreed statement of reasons, but more importantly  I  think  the
    point that needs to  be  raised  is  to  the  decision  of  Mr  Justice
    McCloskey  sitting  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Mehmood   (legitimate
    expectation) [2014] UKUT 469 where he said:-

         "The first question in every case concerning an alleged  legitimate
         expectation is whether  the  public  authority  concerned  made  an
         unambiguous representation, promise  or  assurance  devoid  of  any
         relevant qualification."

16. I do not consider that any of the material put before me is capable  of
    reaching that standard.  All that could possibly be  said  is  that  it
    might  possibly  be  inferred  that  the  applicant  had  been  granted
    discretionary leave, but still less could it be  inferred  properly  or
    rationally that her leave, were it in  that  capacity,  may  have  been
    backdated.  I agree with Mr Malik's submission that the phrase "in line
    with" is not a precise and unambiguous representation giving rise to  a
    legitimate expectation, and finally  there  is  before  me  no  witness
    statement from the applicant setting out what her belief was or why she
    came to that conclusion.  I do not consider the fact that she made  the
    application having been properly advised by her solicitors or  to  make
    an application for indefinite leave to remain that this  is  indicative
    of her belief.   It is  insufficient to reach the required standard.


17. I am satisfied that the applicant was not granted  Discretionary  Leave
    to Remain in 2011 or in 2014, nor do I consider that the leave that she
    was granted could be any way construed as being granted from  2011.   I
    conclude that the applicant did  not  have  a  legitimate  expectation,
    either that she had been granted Discretionary Leave to Remain or  that
    any leave to remain was backdated to 2011, nor do I accept that she had
    any legitimate expectation that,  contrary  to  the  rules  of  express
    policy for Indefinite Leave to Remain, she would be entitled  to  apply
    for Indefinite Leave to Remain earlier either in 2017 or in 2020,  that
    being dependent on her being granted Discretionary Leave in 2014 on the
    base of a policy which by then had ceased to apply except insofar as it
    was maintained by transitional provisions.  For these reasons I  refuse
    this application.


18. I add one final comment, it is that it was  suggested  in  the  grounds
    that there should be in this  case  a  mandatory  order  directing  the
    Secretary of State to grant leave.  Clearly as I have found  in  favour
    of the applicant there is no need to do so, but I readily  accept  Miss
    Bond's concession that that is not something which could properly  have
    been ordered by the Tribunal, or indeed a court in these circumstances.


19. I refuse permission to appeal on the grounds that I am not satisfied my
    decision involved the making of an error of law.


Costs


20. I have considered carefully the submissions made to me as to whether  I
    should depart from the principle that the losing party should  pay  the
    costs of the successful party.  I take into account what Miss Bond  had
    to say about the applicant's lack of funds, but there is not before  me
    evidence to support that and  I  do  note  that  there  has  been  some
    evidence served  post-grant  that  is  a  relatively  short  amount  of
    material and I am satisfied in all the  circumstances  that  discretion
    should  be  exercised,  such  that  the  applicant   should   pay   the
    respondent's costs to be assessed summarily now.


21. Counsel's fees for the respondent are said to  be  an  estimate  and  I
    think there would be significant difficulty with the level  claimed  as
    three Counsel have been involved and there is an element of duplication
    as a result.


22. Counsel fees for the previous hearing of �350.00 are reasonable.  I  am
    going to deduct �500.00 from Counsel fees so that will  make  �1,500.00
    Counsel fees for the hearing and add the �350.00, so that is  �1,850.00
    for Counsel fees and I am deducting �1,700.00  from  the  fees  on  the
    doucments so that makes the total �4,662.00.  My summary assessment  is
    �4,662.00.  Now, I appreciate that there may  be  difficulties  in  the
    applicant paying, so that comes down to a matter of enforcement.


23.  If  the  representatives  want  to  make  any  representations   about
    enforcement and as to directions I will need to look at those, but Miss
    Bond can make submissions on enforcement within seven days  so  I  will
    leave off perfecting the order until that point.

UPON hearing Ms J Bond instructed by Irvings Solicitors  on  behalf  of  the
Applicants in and Mr Z Malik instructed by the Government  Legal  Department
for the Respondent at the substantive hearing on 10 January 2019.

IT IS ORDERED THAT:

    1) The application for Judicial Review is refused - see attached reasons
       given extempore on 10 January 2019.


    2) Permission to appeal is refused. The Upper Tribunal does not consider
       that its decision involved the making of an  error  of  law  or  that
       there is point of law of public importance such  that  permission  to
       appeal should be granted.


    3) Costs: I order that the applicant pay the respondent's costs which  I
       assess summarily at �4662.

Notification of appeal rights

A refusal by the Upper Tribunal  of  permission  to  bring  judicial  review
proceedings,  following  a  hearing  is  a   decision   that   disposes   of
proceedings.

A party may appeal against such a decision to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was given (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3(2)).
