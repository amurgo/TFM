                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Claire, Counsel instructed by Linder Myers
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
       2008 we make an order prohibiting the disclosure or  publication  of
       any matter likely to lead members of  the  public  to  identify  the
       Appellant. Breach of this order can be punished  as  a  contempt  of
       court. We make this order because the Appellant seeks  international
       protection. We have dismissed his appeal but  it  is  possible  that
       publicity could create a risk that does not otherwise exist.

    2. This is an appeal against a  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       dismissing the appellant's appeal against a decision dated 9 October
       2017 refusing him international protection and leave  to  remain  on
       human rights  grounds.  A  copy  of  the  decision  accompanies  the
       grounds.

    3. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan. He was  born  in  January
       1992.  He arrived in the United Kingdom in 2000.  His mother claimed
       asylum and he was her dependant.  His mother's claim for asylum  was
       refused but she was given exceptional leave to remain until  8  June
       2005 which led to his mother being given indefinite leave to  remain
       in July 2005 and the applicant was given indefinite leave to  remain
       as her dependant.

    4.  The  appellant  has  not  behaved  himself.   His  application  for
       naturalisation was refused because of his conduct.  The Secretary of
       State noted that he had "accumulated  nineteen  convictions  for  30
       offences".  This is rather clumsy.  We assume that it means that the
       appellant has been convicted of 30 offences  on  nineteen  occasions
       between January 2008 and August 2015.  Most significantly on 14  May
       2010 he was convicted at the  Crown  Court  at  Southampton  on  two
       counts of "being concerned with  the  supply  of  controlled  drugs,
       class A (crack cocaine and heroin)".  He was sentenced to concurrent
       terms  of  eighteen  months'  detention  in   a   young   offender's
       institution.  He was told that he was liable for deportation and  he
       applied for  asylum.   The  asylum  claim  was  unsuccessful  and  a
       deportation  order  was  signed.   He  appealed  to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal and the appeal  was  dismissed.   His  appeal  rights  were
       exhausted in May 2016.

    5. In June 2016 further submissions were made on his  behalf  but  held
       not to amount to a fresh claim in  September  2016.   Still  further
       submissions were made in March 2017 and this  led  to  the  decision
       complained of.

    6. The respondent summarised the further submissions at paragraph 20 of
       the refusal letter in the following way:

  "Below is a summary of your further submissions:


  .  The situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated since  refusal  of  your
  asylum claim;


  .  Family life with child - WAH (- December 2016);


  .  Family life with child - I - M - (- June 2015);


  .  Family life with child - A - SH - (- March 2013);


  .  Family life with partner - MMC;


  .  Private life in the UK;


  .  Application to revoke the deportation order against you."


    7. The respondent then considered those submissions.  He  was  assisted
       with the decision of the First-tier Tribunal dated  18  March  2016.
       The respondent did not accept that the appellant was so far  removed
       from life in Afghanistan that  he  could  not  re-establish  himself
       there.   In  particular  the  Secretary  of  State  found  that  the
       appellant had retained some understanding of the Muslim religion and
       could communicate in Afghanistan and that there was no danger to him
       in the event of return.

    8. The Secretary of State found nothing  significant  in  the  "private
       life" component of his private and family life.   The  Secretary  of
       State was conspicuously careful to have regard to the best interests
       of the children who are all  British  citizens.   The  Secretary  of
       State found that the appellant had no contact with the child ASM and
       that he had  not  established  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
       relationship with ASM.  It was the appellant's case that ASM had now
       been adopted and although it was possible that she might  want  some
       contact with the appellant after she had achieved her  majority  the
       Secretary of State found nothing of much assistance to the appellant
       in that relationship.

    9. The circumstances of IM are different.  IM lives with his mother and
       although he had been allowed some contact that had stopped.   Again,
       the Secretary of State found that the appellant had not  established
       a genuine and subsisting parental relationship.

   10. The circumstances of the child WOAH are  different  again.   It  was
       accepted that there was there a genuine and subsisting  relationship
       and that had included cohabitation although the Secretary  of  State
       was concerned that the mother identified on  the  birth  certificate
       was not the person who the appellant said was the child's mother.

   11. The Secretary of State accepted the finding  of  the  judge  in  the
       first hearing that it would be unduly harsh for  W  to  relocate  to
       Afghanistan but also found it would not  be  unduly  harsh  for  the
       child to remain in the United Kingdom with her mother  and  although
       there would be an emotional impact it would not be one that would be
       unduly harsh.

   12. The respondent found  nothing  new  in  the  relationship  with  the
       appellant's present partner.  It was  formed  when  his  immigration
       status was precarious and although  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  to
       expect her to travel to Afghanistan and establish herself  there  it
       was not found unduly harsh for them both to  remain  in  the  United
       Kingdom in the event of the appellant's deportation.

   13. The respondent then, correctly, considered the Rules and looked  for
       very compelling circumstances that would support a decision that  he
       should not be deported.  However, the appellant has  been  convicted
       of serious drug based offences leading to eighteen months' detention
       and the Secretary of State found no such circumstances.

   14. The Secretary of State accepted that the appellant had not committed
       further offences but  did  not  find  that  a  particularly  helpful
       additional factor.

   15. The First-tier Tribunal heard evidence from the appellant's  partner
       and his mother.  The appellant  did  not  pursue  his  asylum  claim
       before the First-tier Tribunal.

   16. The judge found no significant change since the appellant's case was
       last before the First-tier Tribunal.  He found there were  no  "very
       significant obstacles in the appellant  re-establishing  himself  in
       Afghanistan".

   17. He then looked carefully at the relationship with the children.   He
       accepted the appellant was trying to  resume  contact  with  IM  but
       matters had gone no further than that.

   18. The judge accepted that the appellant had been out  of  trouble  for
       some time but did not accept that he had completely  stopped  taking
       drugs although the occasions seemed to be rare.

   19. The judge considered the impact of removal on the partner and  their
       child and found  the  public  interest  in  removing  the  appellant
       outweighed the harm to them and dismissed the appeal.

   20. Permission to appeal was refused  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  but
       granted on renewal by a Deputy Upper  Tribunal  Judge.   The  Deputy
       Judge was particularly concerned that the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
       not given proper reasoning for  his  conclusion  that  it  would  be
       unduly harsh for the appellant's partner and child  for  him  to  be
       removed leaving them without his support and that it had  not  shown
       that there were very significant obstacle to his integration.

   21. The Deputy Judge was also concerned  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge was looking for "very significantly compelling  circumstances"
       which is not a phrase that appears in the  Rule  or  the  Act.   She
       assumed that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  was  looking  for  "very
       compelling  circumstances,"  which  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       correctly identified as the issue at para 18 of  the  determination.
       Additionally the Deputy Judge was concerned that insufficient regard
       had been given to  the  order  of  a  Family  Court  in  April  2019
       directing Social Services to provide information about the  child  I
       and her mother.

   22. Before us Mr Claire submitted that the grant of permission  set  out
       matters in some detail.  It seems to  us  that  the  Deputy  Judge's
       biggest concern when she gave  permission  was  the  effect  of  the
       removal on his present partner and their child.

   23.  Given  its  importance  to  the  case  the  information  about  the
       relationship between the appellant and his partner  is  surprisingly
       thin.  The statements show that it began at the end of 2014 and they
       have continued to live together supporting each other and  having  a
       daughter who was born in December 2016.  Both  statements  say  that
       the appellant's partner has health problems  which  the  appellant's
       partner describes in the following terms:

  "As a result of this skeletal defect, I now  have  long-term  health  and
  mobility issues.  Over the years, my health has  been  a  concern  to  my
  family, GP and friends.  I have suffered nerve damage in both my feet and
  legs which has resulted in me being dependent on my family for  help  and
  support my entire life."

   24. That is a tantalisingly vague claim.  The statements do not  explain
       the nature of that dependency or its extent.  The claim is supported
       by medical evidence.  Certainly there is confirmation of  the  claim
       that the appellant's partner suffers from bilateral metatarsus varus
       deformitis.  There was also evidence of minor surgery being done  to
       the feet.

   25. We note as well that the medical reports use the name of the  mother
       on the birth certificate which is not the same  name  by  which  the
       partner is known.  The date of birth and addresses are the same  and
       we assume that the appellant's partner, as she is perfectly entitled
       to do, uses two different names in different circumstances.

   26. The medical report dated 13  May  2015  says  that  the  appellant's
       partner's foot has not responded as well as was hoped.

   27. What we are not able to do from  the  medical  evidence  is  form  a
       picture of a woman who is wholly dependent on the appellant for  her
       day-to-day care.  She had  some  problems  with  her  feet  and  the
       evidence is that having the appellant around helps but  that  is  as
       far as it goes.  We must assume that we are not  told  more  because
       there is not more to tell and this is not a weighty point.

   28. It is supportive of the appellant but does not illuminate  much,  if
       at all, the adverse effects of removal.

   29. The grounds of appeal supporting the application are more expansive.
        They say that  the  appellant's  partner's  feet  were  damaged  in
       attempts at corrective surgery.  They point out that the  First-tier
       Tribunal on the previous occasion  accepted  that  the  partner  was
       bedbound for two or three days a week and that she was  awarded  the
       maximum personal independent payment, then in the range of  �100  to
       �110 a week.  The partner's  statement  does  explain  that  she  is
       supported by her parents.

   30. We have considered the submissions.  Although we were taken to  case
       law by Mr Claire he accepted that the  decisions  were  illustrative
       and he was not advancing any new points of principle.

   31. We see no basis for attacking the finding  that  the  appellant  can
       return to Afghanistan.  Although there  will  be  difficulties  very
       large numbers of young men from Afghanistan  are  considered  to  be
       able to  return.  There  is  economic  activity  in  Kabul  and  the
       advantages of some experience in the west,  as  well  as  reasonable
       health, give people returned from the United Kingdom the  chance  to
       establish themselves.  No-one pretends that it is  easy  but  it  is
       achievable and  there  is  no  basis  for  criticising  the  judge's
       decision to that effect.

   32. Clearly the relationship with the older children is non-existent  or
       barely made out and they cannot feature.

   33. The appellant's partner formed the relationship when his immigration
       status was  precarious.   By  statute  (Section  117B(4)(b)  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002) little  weight  should
       be given to a relationship formed with a qualifying partner when the
       person was in the United Kingdom unlawfully. It is unclear when  the
       relationship was "formed" and so we must assume that it was not at a
       time when the appellant was in the United Kingdom unlawfully but his
       status was precarious because he has known about  the  intention  to
       deport him since 2010 and a deportation order was signed in December
       2015.  Even though the relationship is one that should be  respected
       the judge was entitled to give  it  little  weight  because  of  the
       circumstances in which it developed.

   34. The judge rightly identified the need for the appellant  to  satisfy
       the "unduly harsh test" when considering the effect  of  deportation
       on the partner or the child.  Deportation is a severe sanction.  The
       evidence is that the appellant with his partner and child are living
       together as a nuclear family and supporting each other.  The support
       goes beyond the ordinary support between husband and wife because of
       the particular health needs of the appellant's partner.   These  are
       not exaggerated and it was clear that she is  assisted  by  her  own
       parents.  However  she  is  a  little  bit  more  dependent  on  the
       appellant than might otherwise be the case and  that  is  important.
       There must be some concern about the prospect of his partner in less
       than perfect health having to manage on her own and bring  up  their
       infant daughter. It is well accepted that she could not go to him in
       Afghanistan and he would not be allowed back to her.   Communication
       will be possible from time to time but nothing close  to  day-to-day
       support is possible.  It must be likely that their relationship will
       diminish.

   35. We have reflected on this.  Deportation can be expected to interrupt
       significantly very important  human  relationships  and  will  often
       sever them but it is what Parliament says is required.  The position
       is different if the effect is "unduly harsh". It follows  that  some
       harshness is expected.  Having regard to the judgment of the Supreme
       Court in KO (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
       [2018] UKSC 53, at para 27, we are not persuaded that the effect  of
       deportation would be unduly harsh.

   36. We also note that there is nothing in the relationship  between  the
       appellant and his mother which amounts  to  much  on  an  Article  8
       balancing exercise.  She is an  independent  adult.   No  doubt  she
       would prefer her son to be in the United Kingdom  but  that  is  not
       relevant.

   37. With respect the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  reasoning  was,  in
       places, thin and we understand why the Deputy Judge gave  permission
       but it is clear enough and when we dig deeper we find  that  nothing
       of merit has been overlooked.

Notice of Decision

It follows that we dismiss the  appeal  against  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
decision.
