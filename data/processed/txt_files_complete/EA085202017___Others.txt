Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr S Khan, instructed by Malik & Malik Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Brocklesby-Weller, Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The second  Appellant  Mrs  Zoya  [N]  is  a  citizen  of  Norway.  The
    remaining Appellants are citizens of Afghanistan. The  application  was
    made by the second Appellant for a residence card as confirmation of  a
    permanent right of residence in the UK and the remaining Appellants are
    her dependants. I shall refer to the second Appellant as the  Appellant
    in this decision.

2.   The Appellant appeals against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Fowell dated 7 June 2018 dismissing her appeal against the refusal of a
    permanent residence card under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.

3.   Permission to appeal was granted on 26 November 2018 by Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Pitt on the grounds it  was  arguable  that  the  judge  took  an
    incorrect approach to the earnings  of  the  EEA  national  spouse  and
    whether under EEA law they could be said to be marginal or ancillary.

4.   The grounds are essentially twofold. The judge erred  in  his  approach
    to the evidence of the business' turnover and expenses  and,  secondly,
    misdirected himself in the application of the community law concept  of
    effective and genuine activity by  focusing  solely  on  the  level  of
    profit from the business.


Submissions

5.   Mr Khan submitted that the judge stated that the  bank  statements  did
    not show business expenditure or credit card payments  and  essentially
    concluded that there was no documentary evidence that the business  was
    running (at paragraph 25 and  26).   There  were  two  errors  in  this
    finding. Firstly, at paragraph 14, it was clear that the Appellant gave
    evidence that she was paid in cash, which did not show up in  her  bank
    account, and that she had no separate business  account.  Her  business
    was a cash business. Her income was generated in cash and her outgoings
    paid for in cash. This evidence was not part of the judge's evaluation.



6.   At paragraph 27, the judge  concluded  that  there  was  no  basis  for
    finding that her accounts were bogus. It must be implied  that  if  the
    judge had concluded that they were not false, then it must  be  implied
    that they were genuine.  There  was  no  mention  of  the  accounts  in
    paragraphs 25 or 26. The judge had failed to  take  into  account  HMRC
    documentation and the evidence of the Appellant's accounts prepared  by
    accountants in addition to the oral evidence to show that the  business
    was effective and running.  The judge did not  take  into  account  the
    cash nature of the business but focused on a lack of  evidence  in  the
    bank statement,  thereby  ignoring  a  significant  proportion  of  the
    evidence before him.

7.   In relation to the second ground, Mr  Khan  submitted  that  the  judge
    calculated that the Appellant's income contributed to  ten  percent  of
    the family income. This was a restrictive approach  because  the  judge
    failed to also take into account the nature and type  of  business  the
    Appellant was running.  He erred  in  focusing  solely  on  the  income
    generated. The Appellant did not need to show that her income  was  not
    marginal or ancillary, but that her  self-employment  was  genuine  and
    effective. The judge failed to consider seasonal and  part-time  nature
    of her self-employment; the fact that the  Appellant  moved  to  a  new
    house and had to re-establish herself on numerous occasions;  the  fact
    that she had taken time off for her children;  and  her  illness.  This
    meant that her contribution to the family income was low. However,  her
    business generated a turnover of  ï¿½15,000  which  was  not  taken  into
    account. It was incorrect for the judge to say that her employment  was
    marginal and ancillary because she only contributed ten percent to  the
    income of the family.

8.   Further, the judge failed to take into account the damage  to  her  ice
    cream van in 2014 and the fact that she was working between  three  and
    five hours a day which suggested her work was genuine. There  was  also
    an investment in equipment and products which were part of establishing
    that her work was genuine. The focus on income and profit  as  part  of
    the family income was an error of law.

9.   For the Respondent, Ms Brocklesby-Weller submitted that there were  two
    issues.  Firstly, whether the business was trading and secondly whether
    the earnings were marginal or ancillary. She submitted that  the  judge
    went out of his way to identify evidence which was before the Tribunal.
    It was clear from paragraphs 24 to 26 that  the  judge  had  adopted  a
    holistic approach and had considered the evidence in the round.

10.  The issue was whether the Appellant was a qualified person,  exercising
    Treaty rights during the relevant five-year period. The bank statements
    were relevant to this  issue.   The  judge  noted  that  there  was  no
    evidence of payments within the five-year period and the invoices  were
    not reflected in the Appellant's bank account.  There  were  no  credit
    card statements or payments  made.  If  the  Appellant  was  running  a
    business, there would  have  been  receipts  and  invoices  which  were
    presumably presented to the accountant to produce the accounts in order
    to be able to give a figure for turnover. However, the evidence  before
    the judge was incomplete and the judge was unable to  evaluate  whether
    the Appellant was exercising Treaty rights for a period of five years.

11.  The judge noted that the bank statements were incomplete and covered  a
    period in 2013 and then again in 2018. On that basis alone,  there  was
    insufficient evidence to substantiate a finding of permanent residence.
    In relation to paragraph 27, there was insufficient  evidence  to  show
    that the accounts were false.  That  issue  was  not  relevant  to  the
    decision because there was  insufficient  evidence  to  show  that  the
    Appellant had discharged the burden of showing that she was  exercising
    Treaty rights for a five-year period.

12.   Ms  Brocklesby-Weller  submitted  that  the  judge's  conclusions   at
    paragraph 28 onwards were in the alternative. If the evidence which was
    before  the  judge  was  sufficient  to  show  that  the  business  was
    operating, then the judge considered whether the  Appellant's  earnings
    were marginal or ancillary. Again, he did not have a  complete  picture
    of the money coming in and out of  the  Appellant's  bank  account  and
    therefore looked only at years 2013 and  2018.   He  then  conducted  a
    mathematical analysis which showed that in  2013  the  family's  income
    consisted of 75% from state  funds,  16%  percent  from  her  husband's
    income and 9% percent from her income.  Whereas in 2018 the reliance on
    state funds was reduced to 42%, her husband's contribution was 48%  and
    the remaining 10% percent came from the Appellant's business.

13.  The question the judge asked himself at paragraph 34 was  correct.   He
    then  applied  relevant  case  law  and  considered   the   Appellant's
    submissions, which he had set out at paragraphs 18 to 20. At  paragraph
    38 it was clear that the judge adopted  a  broad  construction  to  the
    definition of worker in EU law and his conclusion that the  Appellant's
    economic activity was marginal or ancillary was  open  to  him  on  the
    evidence before him. There was insufficient evidence to show  that  she
    was engaging in sufficient economic activity under the Regulations. The
    judge had not confined himself to a particular form of  employment  but
    had adopted a holistic  approach  and  considered  the  nature  of  the
    business. The previous grant of a residence card was  not  relevant  to
    the question of permanent rights of residence for a five-year period.

14.  The judge properly  directed  himself  in  law  which  he  set  out  at
    paragraph 2: "To succeed in the appeal it is necessary for Mrs  [N]  to
    show that she has been exercising Treaty rights for a  period  of  five
    years continuously and her claim is that  she  has  been  self-employed
    running an ice cream business for the necessary period."

15.  In response, Mr Khan  submitted  that  the  question  the  judge  asked
    himself at paragraph 34 was incorrect. The judge stated:  "Despite  the
    imperfections in the evidence therefore, the broad position is that Mrs
    [N]'s income appears to represent  about  ten  percent  of  the  family
    income over the period in question.  Is that  marginal  or  ancillary?"
    The judge had looked merely at income when he should have looked at the
    entirety of the Appellant's economic activity, the seasonal  nature  of
    the business, the hours she worked and the fact that it  was  a  purely
    cash business.  It was not just  the  amount  she  contributed  to  the
    household income  that  was  relevant  to  the  test  of  marginal  and
    ancillary.

16.  In relation to the first ground, he submitted  that  the  judge  should
    first have considered  whether  the  Appellant  was  exercising  Treaty
    rights and, secondly, whether it was  for  the  five-year  period.  The
    judge had not considered all the evidence, in particular, the accounts.
    He submitted that if an error was found the matter should  be  remitted
    to the First-tier Tribunal in order to make factual findings.


Discussion and Conclusion

17.  The evidence that was before the  judge  relating  to  the  Appellant's
    business amounted to a number of bank statements, invoices  from  2012,
    2014 and 2016/17 and accounts prepared by  an  accountant.  There  were
    invoices paid for by credit card but no  credit  card  statements  were
    provided and there were only two payments by credit card visible in the
    Appellant's bank statements.

18.  I am of the view that, reading the decision as a whole, the  judge  has
    taken into account all the evidence  before  him,  not  only  the  bank
    statements to which he specifically refers at paragraphs 25 and 26.  It
    is clear that he has  considered  the  accounts  because  he  uses  the
    figures for turnover in assessing the Appellant's income in relation to
    the second ground of the appeal.

19.  I am not persuaded by Mr Khan's submission that the judge's evaluation
    at paragraphs 25 and 26 failed to take  into  account  the  Appellant's
    oral  evidence  or  the  documentary  evidence  other  than  the   bank
    statements. The judge stated that the Appellant's oral evidence was  at
    odds with the payments made in her bank statements.  The Appellant said
    it was a cash business and it was submitted that she was paid  in  cash
    and that she paid for  all  her  expenses  in  cash.  However,  it  was
    apparent from the bank statements produced that there were two payments
    to Mastercard in 2013 and two of the invoices showed that the Appellant
    had paid for goods from Makro by Mastercard.  However,  she  failed  to
    produce any credit card  statements  or  any  further  details  of  the
    Mastercard.

20.  I find that the judge took into account her oral evidence that  it  was
    a cash business but found that it was not supported by the  documentary
    evidence produced. In any event,  the  documentary  evidence  that  was
    produced was incomplete. The  onus  is  on  the  Appellant  to  produce
    sufficient evidence to show that she was self-employed for  the  period
    of five years in order to be granted permanent residence. It  is  quite
    clear from the judge's findings at 25 to  27  that  he  concludes  that
    there was insufficient evidence to establish that  she  was  exercising
    Treaty rights for a five-year period.

21.  The judge found that there was insufficient evidence to show  that  the
    Appellant had been running an ice cream business for five  years.   The
    judge did not need to make a finding as to whether  the  accounts  were
    genuine  because  even  with  those  accounts  there  was  insufficient
    evidence to show that the business was running and operating for a five-
    year period.

22.  I find that the Appellant failed  to  provide  sufficient  evidence  to
    show that she was self-employed for a period of five  years  and  there
    was no error of law in the judge's conclusion that the appeal should be
    dismissed on that basis. This  finding  is  fatal  to  the  Appellant's
    appeal and therefore any error in relation to whether her earnings were
    marginal or ancillary is not material. In any event, I find that  there
    was no misapplication of the relevant test. The judge took into account
    all relevant factors in deciding whether overall her economic  activity
    could be regarded as marginal or ancillary.

23.  The fact that the Appellant was granted a residence card  in  2014  was
    not relevant to the judge's finding that the Appellant  had  failed  to
    show that she was exercising a Treaty rights for a five-year period.

24.  The judge's conclusion that there was  insufficient  evidence  to  show
    that the Applicant was exercising Treaty rights for a five-year  period
    was open to him on the evidence before him. There was no error  of  law
    in the decision to dismiss the appeal.

25.  Accordingly, I find there is no error of law in the decision of 7  June
    2018 and I dismiss the Appellant's appeal.
