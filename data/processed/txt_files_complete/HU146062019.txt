For the Respondent:    Mr J Gajjar of Counsel, instructed by Briton
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This has been a remote hearing which has not been objected  to  by  the
    parties.  The form of remote hearing was by video, using Skype.  A face
    to face hearing was not held to take precautions against the spread  of
    Covid-19 and as all issues could be determined by  remote  means.   The
    documents were available in paper format on the court file.

 2. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Young-Harry promulgated on 5  November  2019,
    in which Mr Yasin's appeal against the decision  to  refuse  his  human
    rights claim (for indefinite leave to remain on  the  grounds  of  long
    residence under paragraph 276B  of  the  Immigration  Rules)  dated  14
    August 2019 was allowed.  For ease I continue to refer to  the  parties
    as they were before the First-tier  Tribunal,  with  Mr  Yasin  as  the
    Appellant and the Secretary of State as the Respondent.

 3. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan, who first entered  the  United
    Kingdom with entry clearance as a student on 27 March 2009, with  leave
    to remain as such to 30 June  2010.   The  Appellant  was  subsequently
    granted leave to remain as a Tier 1 (post-study work)  and  then  as  a
    Tier 1 (General) migrant, up to 21 June 2016.   The  Appellant  applied
    for indefinite leave to remain as a Tier 1  migrant  on  18  June  2016
    which was initially refused on 18 January 2018, but that  decision  was
    subsequently withdrawn following an application  for  Judicial  Review.
    The application then became outstanding again  and  was  varied  to  an
    application for indefinite leave to  remain  on  the  grounds  of  long
    residence on 15 March 2019.

 4. The Respondent refused the application  under  paragraph  276B(ii)  and
    (iii) of the Immigration Rules, with reference to  paragraph  276D  and
    322(5) of  the  same.   In  essence,  the  Respondent  found  that  the
    Appellant had been dishonest, either in overinflating his  earnings  in
    an application for leave to remain or in under-declaring  his  earnings
    to HMRC so as  to  avoid  tax  liability.   This  was  identified  from
    significant discrepancies between the Appellant's declarations  to  the
    Respondent and subsequent  tax  returns  to  HMRC.   In  the  tax  year
    2010/11, the Appellant had claimed to  the  Respondent  to  have  self-
    employed earnings of �32,075 but in his original declaration  to  HMRC,
    claimed that he had only and �19,718 from self-employed  earnings.   He
    later amended this return with HMRC to show earnings of  �31,248.   The
    Appellant claimed to the Respondent to have self-employed  earnings  of
    �36,146 covering the two tax years, 2012/13  and  2013/14  but  in  his
    original tax returns to HMRC he declared a total of �17,666 across both
    tax years; again later amended to show a higher amount.

 5. Judge Young-Harry allowed the appeal in a  decision  promulgated  on  5
    November 2019 on the basis that the Appellant did not  act  dishonestly
    and therefore a grant of leave to remain would not be  undesirable  due
    to his conduct and he met all of the requirements of paragraph 276B  of
    the Immigration Rules; such that his appeal was allowed on human rights
    grounds.  The totality of the First-tier  Tribunal's  consideration  of
    and findings in relation to dishonesty are contained within  paragraphs
    12 to 17 of the decision as follows:

         "12. The appellant argues that he qualifies  for  leave  to  remain
         based on his 10 years lawful continuous residence in the  UK.   The
         respondent however argues that the appellant failed to disclose the
         correct self-assessment tax calculations  between  2010  and  2014.
         The appellant appears to have under-inflated his  income  for  that
         period, such that the respondent alleges he did so either to gain a
         tax advantage or immigration  advantage  for  the  purpose  of  his
         student extension application figures.

         13.  By way of explanation the appellant stated that the fault lies
         entirely with A&H Accountants, his former accountants.  He  noticed
         there was a discrepancy in 2014, however he failed to  act  because
         it had not caused many problems.  However he decided to notify HMRC
         and send amendments sometime in 2018.  It was at  this  stage  that
         the appellant apparently  contacted  A&H  Accountants  to  lodge  a
         complaint.  However he did not  get  a  response,  neither  has  he
         followed it up.

         14.  He further claims that he  could  not  immediately  amend  the
         figures because the paperwork recording all his sales and invoices,
         were stolen from his car.  He claims he later had  to  contact  all
         his customers in order to retrieve the information.

         15.  The appellant argues that when he  contacted  HMRC  about  the
         discrepancies, they simply asked him to pay a penalty, however they
         did not allege dishonesty.

         16.   The  appellant  explained  that  he  failed  to  mention  A&H
         Accountants among the list of his accountants, on the  respondent's
         tax questionnaire because he misunderstood the question.

         17.  Although some  aspects  of  the  appellant's  explanation  are
         questionable, I accept his explanation as reasonable.  I  find  the
         respondent has not done enough to  establish  dishonesty.   I  note
         also that the respondent has  failed  to  rebut  or  challenge  the
         appellant's reasonable explanation,  with  any  further  supporting
         evidence."

The appeal

 6. The Respondent appeals on four grounds as  follows.   First,  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal has materially erred in law by applying  the  wrong
    standard of proof to  the  question  of  whether  the  Appellant  acted
    dishonestly, which is on the balance of probabilities and there  is  no
    standard of whether the Appellant had given a  reasonable  explanation,
    as referred to in paragraph 17 of the  decision.   Secondly,  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal materially erred in  law  in  concluding  that  the
    Appellant did not act dishonestly when there  was  sufficient  evidence
    before it to conclude otherwise.  Thirdly, that the First-tier Tribunal
    materially erred in law by irrationally concluding that  the  Appellant
    had given a reasonable explanation of the discrepancies in his earnings
    declarations.  Fourthly, that the First-tier Tribunal did not take into
    account the lack of any evidence to  substantiate  the  claim  that  an
    accountant was entirely to blame for the discrepancies,  the  relevance
    of which is set out in R (Shabaz Khan) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2018] UKUT 00384 which emphasises that mere  assertion
    such a fault is not sufficient.

 7. At the oral hearing, Mr Clarke relied on  the  grounds  of  appeal  and
    focused in his oral submissions on the irrationality of the  First-tier
    Tribunal's findings with particular reference to  the  evidence  before
    it.  By way of example, Mr Clarke drew attention to the evidence  which
    identified the Appellant's accountant responsible for both his accounts
    submitted with his application for leave to remain  to  the  Respondent
    and for his tax returns to HMRC as Ashton Cooper & Co Accountants up to
    2014, referred to in the reasons for refusal letter (from the  original
    applications  to  the  Respondent),  the  Appellant's  response  to   a
    questionnaire about  his  earnings  and  the  Appellant's  own  written
    statement.  This was contrasted to the Appellant's  later  reliance  on
    mistakes made by A&H Accountants and a complaint made to them in  March
    2018 in relation to the tax year  2013/14.   This  is  the  Appellant's
    explanation recorded in  paragraph  13  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision but could not on any view be an explanation for  discrepancies
    relied upon by the  Respondent  in  three  earlier  tax  years,  up  to
    2012/13, when there was no suggestion of A&H Accountants being involved
    at all with the Appellant's income  or  tax  affairs  until  after  the
    relevant period relied upon by the Respondent.  It is  noteworthy  that
    there was no evidence of nor any  claim  that  there  was  a  complaint
    against Ashton Cooper & Co Accountants, a point not considered  at  all
    by the First-tier Tribunal.

 8. In addition, Mr Clarke highlighted that in paragraph 17 of the decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal the Judge  applied  the  wrong  standard  of
    proof and accepted what he considered to be an explanation which was in
    some respects questionable, to nonetheless be a reasonable one.  It was
    submitted that this was wholly irrational on the  evidence  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, failed to contain adequate  reasons  and  was  not
    supported by evidence from the Appellant, even taken at its highest.

 9. On behalf of the Appellant, Mr Gajjar opposes the appeal on  the  basis
    that there were no material errors of law in the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal.  As a  preliminary  point,  he  questioned  whether  the
    submissions made by Mr Clarke  orally  were  actually  covered  by  the
    grounds of appeal upon  which  permission  was  granted,  in  which  no
    specific reference was made to the evidential matters  relied  upon  at
    the hearing, even with a generous reading of the grounds of appeal.

10. On the substance of the  appeal,  Mr  Gajjar  accepted  that  on  first
    reading the Appellant's evidence was complicated but  in  essence,  his
    case was that A&H Accountants were to blame for the error  in  his  tax
    returns and he had provided an explanation as  to  why  they  were  not
    identified on the questionnaire from the Respondent  in  oral  evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal.  It was submitted  that  there  was  no
    need for the First-tier Tribunal to refer to each and every part of the
    evidence before it, particularly as the Respondent attended the hearing
    and heard the evidence.  In these circumstances it was  submitted  that
    sufficient  reasons  for  finding  that  the  Appellant  had  not  been
    dishonest were given in paragraphs 16 and 17 of the First-tier Tribunal
    decision and were sufficient  for  the  Respondent  to  understand  the
    reasons why the appeal was allowed.

11. Mr Gajjar made detailed reference to some pieces of the evidence  which
    supported the Appellant's claim  and  his  appeal  being  allowed,  but
    accepted that this was not straightforward, in some respects was on its
    face inconsistent or incorrect  (as  in  the  Appellant's  own  written
    statement, for example in paragraph 5) but  that  the  correct  meaning
    could nonetheless be inferred in the  Appellant's  favour.   Mr  Gajjar
    accepted that his own submission that there was a need to untangle  the
    evidence, may support the finding that there was an error of law in the
    First-tier  Tribunal's  decision,  but  when  one  does  untangle   the
    evidence, it was submitted that any error could not be material to  the
    outcome of the appeal.

12. A similar submission was made in relation to what was accepted to be  a
    factual error in the paragraph 13 of the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, as to the date of amendment of tax returns with  HMRC,  which
    were in fact two years earlier and there was therefore  no  significant
    delay in the amendments being made once the errors had been identified.

13. As to the burden and  standard  of  proof  applied  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, Mr Gajjar submitted that the  First-tier  Tribunal  correctly
    followed the ping-pong  approach  to  be  applied  to  cases  involving
    allegations of dishonesty, whereby the initial evidential burden is  on
    the Respondent, following which the burden shifts to the  Appellant  to
    establish an innocent explanation to a minimum  level  of  plausibility
    and then reverts to the Respondent  to  establish  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities that the Appellant had been  dishonest.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal identifies and accepts that the initial burden has been met by
    its reference in paragraph 12 of the decision to the Respondent's  case
    and if anything, has only satisfied itself of a higher  threshold  than
    necessary in relation to  the  Appellant's  explanation  by  finding  a
    reasonable explanation rather  than  an  innocent  explanation  to  the
    minimum level of plausibility.  Finally, the First-tier Tribunal refers
    to the Respondent's failure to rebut the  explanation  and  failing  to
    satisfy the final burden to establish dishonesty.

14. In relation to reasonableness, Mr Gajjar relied on paragraph 74 of  the
    Supreme Court's decision in Ivy v Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67,  that
    what is important when  considering  dishonesty  is  to  ascertain  the
    actual state of an individual's knowledge or belief as to the facts and
    the reasonableness or otherwise  of  such  a  belief  is  a  matter  of
    evidence going to whether it was genuinely held rather than  reasonably
    held.

15. In reply, Mr Clarke submitted that the Appellant's claim that any error
    would not be material must fail on the basis that the explanation given
    only related to the latest tax return which  identified  a  discrepancy
    and not the earlier ones, which the argument fails to  engage  with  at
    all.  Further the reliance only on paragraph 74 of the decision in  Ivy
    fails to engage with the second part of the test which was that it must
    be shown that the belief was  genuine  by  the  standards  of  ordinary
    people and it cannot be shown that this was considered  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal at all.

Findings and reasons

16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is, even  relatively  speaking,
    extremely brief given the nature of the issues raised in the appeal and
    the extent of the evidence before it.  There is  no  identification  at
    all of the relevant burden or standard of proof to be applied in  cases
    where there is an allegation of dishonesty, nor is there any  reference
    at  all  to  relevant  authority  on  cases  such  as  this   involving
    discrepancy of earnings, including in  particular  the  main  authority
    from the Court of Appeal in Balajigari v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 673, nor the Upper Tribunal's  decision
    in R (Shabaz Khan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2018]
    UKUT 00384.

17. The First-tier Tribunal's decision refers in summary to the documentary
    evidence before it (by way of list of types of documents only) and  the
    fact that there was oral evidence by the Appellant.  The  Judge  states
    that all of the  documents  have  been  carefully  considered  even  if
    specific items are not referred  to  within  the  findings.   There  is
    however little or no reference to any of the specific  evidence  before
    the First-tier Tribunal save for the very broad brush  general  summary
    of the respective cases of the Appellant and Respondent  in  paragraphs
    12 to 16 of the decision, set out above.  The decision lacks any detail
    of the nature and extent of the discrepancies  in  multiple  tax  years
    relied upon by  the  Respondent,  nor  any  conclusion  that  this  was
    sufficient to meet the initial evidential burden for dishonesty.   Even
    on the most generous reading of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision,
    what is essentially a summary of the Respondent's decision in paragraph
    12 this regard, contains no factual findings whatsoever and contains no
    reference to even whether a prima facie case has been established.

18. As to the Appellant's  explanation,  this  is  again  recorded  in  the
    decision in only very brief terms, with no  reference  at  all  to  any
    specific documents supporting the explanation (nor any recognition that
    in numerous respects there were no  such  supporting  documents).   The
    summary in paragraphs 13 to 16 of the decision contains no analysis  of
    the Appellant's explanation  or  evidence,  nor  does  it  contain  any
    findings on it whatsoever.  At its highest, it is only in paragraph  17
    of the decision that there is anything which could be identified  as  a
    finding of fact in relation to dishonesty and not a  single  reason  is
    given for the finding  that  it  has  not  been  established  that  the
    Appellant was dishonest, nor is there  any  reference  at  all  to  the
    relevant legal test or how it was (or was not) satisfied by the parties
    in this case.

19. The First-tier Tribunal refers  to  some  aspects  of  the  Appellant's
    explanation being questionable, without  any  identification  of  which
    aspects are questionable (or why), nor any  reasons  given  as  to  why
    nonetheless the explanation was found to  be  reasonable,  or  on  what
    basis.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal simply failed to engage
    at all with the correct test to be applied or the evidence  before  it,
    with no analysis of that evidence  and  no  findings  beyond  a  simple
    conclusion which was wholly unexplained.  Whilst it is  trite  that  is
    not necessary for the First-tier Tribunal to refer to  each  and  every
    piece of evidence, it is necessary to have some specific  reference  to
    it and make clear findings on the same.  There is no basis  upon  which
    any reader of the decision could understand why the appeal was allowed,
    whether or not they were at the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal
    and perhaps even more so for the parties who  were  present  given  the
    acceptance of the complicated nature of the evidence  that  was  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

20. In circumstances where the First-tier  Tribunal  had  recorded  only  a
    single explanation for all of the discrepancies, amounting to  no  more
    than mere assertion of error by an accountant not previously identified
    by the Appellant as having any involvement with either his accounts  or
    tax returns in the  three  relevant  tax  years  in  which  there  were
    significant discrepancies between earnings declared to  the  Respondent
    and to HMRC; it is impossible to discern from the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal any rational basis for the conclusion that the  Appellant
    had given  an  innocent  explanation  even  to  the  minimum  level  of
    plausibility, let alone a reasonable explanation (which is not  in  any
    event the  correct test), nor  that  overall  the  Respondent  had  not
    established dishonesty.  Even if the First-tier Tribunal  had  accepted
    the entirety of the Appellant's explanation as credible and  plausible,
    including his oral evidence that he had misunderstood the  question  on
    the Respondent's tax questionnaire and without  supporting  documentary
    evidence for the core of the Appellant's account; the explanation of an
    error by A&H Accountants and complaint to them in 2018 did not  address
    discrepancies in the earlier tax years relied upon by  the  Respondent.
    On any rational view, this explanation,  on  the  evidence  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, did not address all of the prima facie case relied
    upon by the Respondent and could not  therefore  have  amounted  to  an
    innocent explanation even to the very  low  threshold  of  the  minimum
    level of plausibility for the totality of the significant discrepancies
    over a three-year period.

21. For these reasons, I find multiple errors of law in the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal, as to the burden and standard of proof applied; as
    to the almost complete failure to engage  with,  analyse  or  make  any
    findings whatsoever on the evidence before it; as  to  the  failure  to
    give any reasons  whatsoever  for  the  bare  conclusions  reached  and
    overall making findings which were not rationally open  to  it  on  the
    evidence.  As such, it is necessary to set aside the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal and for the decision to be remade de novo.

22. It is understood that the Appellant's wife currently has an outstanding
    human rights appeal before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  which  had  been
    stayed pending the outcome of  the  present  appeal  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal and that as a matter  of  practicality  and  efficiency,  this
    appeal should be remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  such  that
    consideration can be given to linking the two appeals and hearing  them
    together.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such it is  necessary  to  set  aside
the decision.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and remit the appeal  to
the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo hearing before any Judge except  Judge
Young-Harry.

It is expected that the First-tier Tribunal will give further directions  as
to the determination of this appeal, as foreseen in the directions of First-
tier Tribunal Judge Dixon on 23 July 2020, and in particular as  to  whether
it will be linked with the Appellant's wife's appeal in HU/17040/2019.

No anonymity direction is made.
