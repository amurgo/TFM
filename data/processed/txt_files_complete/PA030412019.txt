                         (anonymity direction made)
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Respondent DAY is a national of Sri Lanka born in  1998.  On  the
       28th May 2019 the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Brewer)  allowed  his
       appeal on human rights  grounds.  The  Secretary  of  State  now  has
       permission to appeal against that decision.

    2. The substance of the First-tier Tribunal decision is that this DAY is
       a young man who had, by the date of his appeal,  accrued  six  years'
       continuous residence with Discretionary Leave (DL) and that as  such,
       under the terms of Home Office policy, he qualified for  a  grant  of
       Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR).    The substance of  the  Secretary
       of State 's appeal before the Upper Tribunal was that in so  finding,
       the First-tier Tribunal has misconstrued the said policy.

    3. Before I turn to deal with the parties' respective arguments  on  the
       policy issue it is appropriate that I record two matters.

    4. First, that this  appeal  is  determined  by  me  alone  following  a
       transfer order signed by  Principle  Resident  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
       O'Connor on the 27th September 2019 September 2019.  The  appeal  was
       originally heard by myself and Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Holmes
       sitting at the Royal Courts of Justice on the 22nd July 2019. At that
       hearing both parties simply sought to rely on a  Home  Office  Asylum
       Policy Instruction (API) dated August  2015  entitled  'Discretionary
       Leave'. The part in issue was entitled  'transitional  arrangements'.
       That being so, we were surprised to find that neither party had  seen
       fit to furnish us with the policy that preceded the August 2015  API.
       The heading 'transitional arrangements' was to our  minds  indicative
       of  the  fact  that  this  document  was  intended  to  reflect   the
       arrangements to be made -  in the transitional period -  between  one
       policy and another.   We needed therefore to see the original policy.
       The hearing was adjourned so that said policy could be produced,  and
       if necessary submissions made on it. The Tribunal thereafter received
       from Mr Bramble, Senior  Presenting  Officer  for  the  Secretary  of
       State, an email containing nothing  more  than  hyperlinks  to  seven
       different policy documents. The Secretary  of  State  then  indicated
       that he intended to make no further submissions.  Ms Miskiel, Counsel
       for DAY  thereafter  provided  some  assistance  by  identifying  and
       providing copies of the actual policy in place when DAY  embarked  on
       his route to settlement, and making detailed written  submissions.  I
       am grateful for her assistance. The  transfer  order  has  been  made
       because it has not proved practicable  to  have  the  matter  resumed
       before myself and Judge Holmes within a reasonable time frame.

    5. Second, it was accepted at the hearing on the  22nd  July  2019  that
       whatever the outcome of the Secretary of State's appeal, this  was  a
       matter that had to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal since there
       were grounds of appeal that had not been addressed by  its  decision,
       viz protection issues and whether DAY qualified for leave  to  remain
       on human rights grounds regardless of the terms of  the  Home  Office
       policy on DL.

    6. Those  preliminary  observations  made,  I  turn  to  deal  with  the
       substance of the appeal.




       Case History and Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

    7. The chronology of pertinent events is as follows:

       18 April 2011   DAY arrives in UK

       10 June 2011    DAY granted DL for three years on grounds that he  is
                        an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child (UASC)

       9 July 2012     Policy changed - transitional provisions in force

       6 May 2014 DAY applied for further DL

            (DL continues by virtue of  s3C(2)(a)  of  the  Immigration  Act
                        1971)

       2 December 2014 DAY granted DL as a UASC until he is 17ï¿½,  on  the  4
                        July 2015

       18 June 2015    DAY makes application for protection and/or leave  on
                        human rights grounds

            (DL continues by virtue of  s3C(2)(a)  of  the  Immigration  Act
                        1971)

       4 January 2016  Respondent's 18th birthday

       1 June 2017     DAY has accrued six years of continuous DL

       14 July 2017    DAY varies his application of 18 June 2015 to include
                        an application for settlement on the  grounds  that
                        he has now accrued six years of DL

       13 March 2019   Decision to refuse to grant asylum, settlement or any
                        further DL

            DAY appeals and so DL continues by virtue  of  s3C(2)(c)of   the
                        Immigration Act 1971

    8. On the 30th April 2019 the appeal came before  Judge  Brewer  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal. The Tribunal's decision is dated  the  28th  May
       2019. It began its reasoning  by  noting  the  Secretary  of  State's
       concession that at the date of the appeal DAY had, by virtue of  s3C,
       accrued almost eight years of  continuous  residence  with  DL.   The
       Secretary of State's position, however,  was  that  settlement  would
       only be granted after 6 years of continuous DL  where  the  applicant
       "continued to qualify for further leave on the same  basis  as  their
       original DL was granted". The DL had been granted because DAY was  an
       unaccompanied minor, and by the date of  the  decision  on  the  13th
       March 2019 he was an adult.

    9.  In considering this contention  the  First-tier  Tribunal  found  as
       follows:

           "23.  I turn then to the DL policy. In the policy  an  applicant
           in fact requires 10 years' residency before being  eligible  for
           settlement. However, the Transitional Arrangements in section 10
           set out that if the decisions made on DL  were  made  under  the
           previous policy, that is the policy in force before 9 July 2012,
           they will continue to  be  dealt  with  under  that  policy  and
           section 10.1 states that "normally  they  will  be  eligible  to
           apply for settlement after accruing 6 years' continuous DL".

           24.    Section  8  of  the  DL  policy  deals  with   settlement
           applications. This confirms as set out in  10.1  that  a  person
           will normally become eligible to apply for  settlement  after  6
           years' (taking account of the transitional arrangements) limited
           leave. The DL policy says at 8.2: "where a person  has  held  DL
           for a continuous period of 6 years and continues to qualify  for
           DL under the policy, they should be  granted  settlement  unless
           there are any criminality or exclusion  issues"  (my  emphasis).
           There are no criminality or exclusion issues in this case.

           25.   The respondent seems to be relying on section  10  of  the
           policy. Section 10.1, part of which I have set out above, states
           that "Those granted leave under the DL policy in force before  9
           July 2012 will normally continue to be  dealt  with  under  that
           policy through to settlement if they  continue  to  qualify  for
           further leave on  the  same  basis  as  their  original  DL  was
           granted".  In a new paragraph the DL  policy  goes  on  to  say:
           "Caseworkers must consider whether the circumstances  prevailing
           at the time of the original grant of leave continue at the  date
           of the decision. If  the  circumstances  remain  the  same,  the
           individual does not fall within the restricted leave policy  and
           the criminality thresholds do not apply, a further period  of  3
           years' DL should normally be granted. Caseworkers must  consider
           whether there are any circumstances that may  warrant  departure
           from the standard period of leave".  The  reference  here  to  a
           further period of 3 years is clearly a reference to further  DL,
           but not ILR/settlement. Indeed, in another  separate  paragraph,
           but still in section 10.1, the DL policy says:  "If  there  have
           been significant changes  that  mean  the  applicant  no  longer
           qualifies for leave under the DL policy or the  applicant  falls
           for refusal on the basis of  criminality  (see  criminality  and
           exclusion section above), the further leave  application  should
           be refused". Again, as I read this it is a reference to  further
           DL.

           26.   In short if,  as  I  suspect,  the  respondent  was  using
           section 10 to consider the appellant's eligibility for ILR,  and
           I think that must be the case considering the language  used  in
           the refusal letter and that in section 10, he  has  fallen  into
           error. The appropriate section is section 8.

           27.   Section 8 simply says what I have set  out  above  -  that
           "where a person has held DL for a continuous period of  6  years
           and continues to qualify for DL under the policy, they should be
           granted settlement unless there are any criminality or exclusion
           issues".

   10.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  being  satisfied  that  there   were   no
       countervailing  factors,  the  appeal  was  allowed.   Although   not
       articulated in the determination the Secretary of State accepts  that
       the basis of the First-tier Tribunal's decision to allow  the  appeal
       on human rights grounds was that the policy was indicative  of  where
       the  balance  should  be  struck  in   terms   of   the   Article   8
       proportionality assessment.




       The Appeal

   11. The dispute between the parties in this appeal relates  to  the  true
       interpretation of the Home Office policy. Where the policy refers  to
       applicants "continuing to qualify for DL" should this be  read  as  a
       requirement for any application  for  further  leave  i.e.  including
       settlement, or is it confined to applications for a further period of
       limited DL?

   12. The policy in force at the date of the decision to refuse  settlement
       was that dated August 2015.  As I have set out above  the  First-tier
       Tribunal found the relevant part  of  that  policy  to  be  found  at
       section 8:

           "Where a person has held DL for a continuous period  of  10  [6]
           years and continues to qualify for DL  under  the  policy,  they
           should be granted settlement unless there are any criminality or
           exclusion issues".

   13. I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal erred  in  confining  its
       analysis to this passage. The first paragraph in section 8  makes  it
       clear that in this case, the relevant section was section 10:

           "This section applies to those  granted  an  initial  period  of
           limited leave under the DL policy on or after 9  July  2012  and
           who do not, at the date of decision, fall within the  restricted
           leave policy. See section 10  -  Transitional  Arrangements  for
           cases where an initial period of DL was granted  before  9  July
           2012".

   14. Section 10 reads as follows. I have highlighted  the  material  parts
       for the purpose of this decision:

           "Those granted leave under the DL policy in force before 9  July
           2012 will normally continue to be dealt with under  that  policy
           through to settlement if they continue to  qualify  for  further
           leave on the  same  basis  as  their  original  DL  was  granted
           (normally they will be eligible to apply  for  settlement  after
           accruing  6  years'  continuous  DL  (or  where  appropriate   a
           combination of DL and LOTR, see section 8 above)), unless at the
           date of decision they fall within the restricted leave policy.

           Caseworkers must consider whether the  circumstances  prevailing
           at the time of the original grant of leave continue at the  date
           of the decision. If  the  circumstances  remain  the  same,  the
           individual does not fall within the restricted leave policy  and
           the criminality thresholds do not apply, a further period  of  3
           years' DL should normally be granted. Caseworkers must  consider
           whether there are any circumstances that may  warrant  departure
           from the standard period of leave. See section 5.4.

           If there have been significant changes that mean  the  applicant
           no longer qualifies  for  leave  under  the  DL  policy  or  the
           applicant falls for refusal on the  basis  of  criminality  (see
           criminality and exclusion  section  above),  the  further  leave
           application should be refused.

   15.  The  Secretary  of  State  here  contends  that  there   have   been
       "significant changes" in that DAY was  no  longer,  at  the  date  of
       decision, an unaccompanied minor.

   16. Ms Miskiel submits that I need not be concerned  with  whether  there
       were significant changes. She submits that in fact the  qualification
       "if they continue to qualify for further leave  on  the  same  basis"
       must be read as only applying to applications  for  further  DL:  the
       only test for settlement is whether the 6 years  have  been  accrued,
       and whether there are any countervailing factors.    I  can  find  no
       support for that interpretation in either the August 2015  policy  or
       the  2011  policy  to  which  it  refers  back.   Under  the  heading
       'Applications for Settlement' the 2011 policy reads:

           "A person will normally become eligible  for  consideration  for
           settlement   after   completing   six   continuous   years    of
           Discretionary Leave. However, where a person is covered  by  one
           of the exclusion categories they will not  become  eligible  for
           consideration for  settlement  until  they  have  completed  ten
           continuous years of  Discretionary  Leave.  Any  time  spent  in
           prison in connection with a criminal conviction would not  count
           towards the six or  ten  years.  An  individual  may  apply  for
           ILR/settlement at the six  or  ten  year  stage  shortly  before
           Discretionary Leave expires. The application will be  considered
           in the light of circumstances prevailing at that time".

           Consideration of Application

           As with an extension request, the application should be  subject
           to an active review  to  consider  whether  or  not  they  still
           qualify for Discretionary Leave (or some other form of leave).

           Granting Settlement

           Where a person has held Discretionary Leave for  an  appropriate
           period and continues to qualify for  Discretionary  Leave,  they
           should be granted ILR/settlement.

   17. In these passages, and in the passages from the 2015  policy  that  I
       have set out above [at ï¿½14] the text repeatedly emphasises  that  the
       test to be applied in considering any application for further  leave,
       is whether the applicant would still qualify for a grant of  DL,  not
       whether he still holds one, for instance by operation  of  s3C.  That
       much is underlined by the following passage from the 2015 policy:

           "7.2 Unaccompanied children who  have  turned  18  Unaccompanied
           children granted DL in accordance with paragraphs 352ZC to 352ZF
           of the Immigration Rules who have turned 18  by  the  time  they
           apply for further leave or whilst a pending application is being
           considered must be considered  in  the  same  way  as  an  adult
           applying for further leave. They  will  no  longer  qualify  for
           further leave as an unaccompanied  child  but  caseworkers  must
           consider whether they  qualify  under  another  category  before
           refusing  the  further  application.  Those  granted  DL  as  an
           unaccompanied child may also apply on another route if they wish
           to extend their limited leave".

   18. This passage was omitted from the First-tier Tribunal's reasoning.  I
       accept that this may be because it did not expressly  apply  to  DAY,
       since he was granted DL prior to the cited rules taking  effect,  but
       the policy, and the meaning thereof, must be read as a whole. If  the
       Secretary of State intended to draw a distinction between  one  class
       of adults who had formerly had grants of DL as children and  another,
       one would expect that the policy would have made that clear.

   19. I am therefore satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal did err in  its
       interpretation of the 'transitional provisions'. The task before  the
       decision-maker, and then the Tribunal, was to consider whether  there
       had in fact been a change in circumstances such that  DAY  no  longer
       qualified for a grant of DL.

   20. In this case there does not appear to be any ambiguity about why  DAY
       was twice granted DL. The Home Office explanatory  statement  records
       that he was granted "UASC leave" on the 10th June 2011, and again  on
       the 2nd  December  2014.  Unlike  the  appellant  in  the  unreported
       decision of Faize (IA/34508/15), upon which  DAY  relied  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal, it cannot be said that the grant of DL  was  "in
       essence  leave  on  protection  grounds",  since  on  both  of  those
       occasions leave was expressly  refused  on  protection  grounds.  The
       incontrovertible fact is that by the time that the Secretary of State
       took  his  decision  there  had  been   a   significant   change   in
       circumstances, in that DAY was no longer a minor.   On that basis the
       Secretary of State was entitled, in accordance with  the  policy,  to
       refuse to grant settlement: see R (on the application of SB (Jamaica)
       and ABD (a minor)) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
       [2016] EWCA Civ 400.

   21. I therefore allow the Secretary of State's appeal, and in  accordance
       with the agreement between the parties at the  hearing  on  the  22nd
       July 2019 (see my ï¿½5 above),  remit  the  matter  to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal.




       Anonymity Order

   22. This case concerns an ongoing  claim  for  international  protection.
       Having had regard  to  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
       Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013:
       Anonymity Orders we therefore consider  it  appropriate  to  make  an
       order in the following terms:

           "Unless and until a tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
           Appellant is granted anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings
           shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member  of  his
           family.  This direction applies to,  amongst  others,  both  the
           Appellant and the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
           direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"


                                                  Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce
                                                         30th September 2019
