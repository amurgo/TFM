For the Appellant:     Ms N Amin of Counsel instructed by Bhavsar Patel
For the Respondent:    Ms Cunha, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Somal promulgated on 5  April  2018  dismissing  an  appeal  against  a
    decision of the Respondent dated  23  August  2017  refusing  leave  to
    remain, on human rights grounds.


2.   The Appellant is a citizen of India  born  on  9  February  1993.   She
    entered the United Kingdom pursuant to  entry  clearance  as  a  spouse
    granted from 27 January 2014 conferring leave until  26  October  2016.
    Entry clearance was granted on the basis of her marriage  to  Mr  Vijay
    Keshav Odedara.


3.   The Appellant made an application for further leave to  remain  on  the
    same basis on 24 October 2016.  That application was put on  pause  by
    the Respondent pending consideration of the case of  MM  (Lebanon)  and
    Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 10.  In
    due course the application was refused on 23 August  2017  for  reasons
    set out in a 'reasons for refusal' letter ('RFRL') of that date.


4.   In the RFRL it was indicated  that  the  Respondent  was  satisfied  in
    respect of the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  save  for  the
    'eligibility financial requirements':  the Respondent was satisfied  on
    'suitability',  'relationship',  'immigration  status',   and   English
    language requirements.


5.   The RFRL noted the financial  requirement  threshold  income  level  of
    �18,600, and then stated:

         "You have failed to demonstrate that you or your  partner  have  an
         annual income  of  �18,600,  either  separately  or  with  combined
         earnings.  You therefore fail to fulfil E-LTRP.3.1 to E-LTRP.3.3 of
         Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules".


6.   The RFRL went on to consider paragraph  EX.1  of  Appendix  FM  in  the
    alternative, but concluded that there would  be  no  "very  significant
    difficulties which would be faced by [the Appellant] or  [her]  partner
    in continuing [their] family life together outside the UK in India, and
    which could not be overcome or would entail very serious hardship".


7.   Private life was also considered pursuant to paragraph  276ADE(1),  but
    in circumstances where the Appellant had not been present in the United
    Kingdom for a significant length of time and continued to  have  family
    ties in her country of origin, it was considered that  the  Rules  were
    not satisfied.


8.   The RFRL then sets out consideration  of  'exceptional  circumstances';
    the decision-maker concluded none were evident.


9.   The Appellant appealed to the IAC.


10.  The appeal was dismissed for reasons set out in the decision  of  Judge
    Somal promulgated on 5 April 2018.



11.  The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    which was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge S H  Smith  on  13  July
    2018.


12.  In dismissing the appeal the First-tier Tribunal Judge found  that  the
    Appellant did not meet the requirement of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    moreover any interference in her Article 8 family and/or  private  life
    in consequence of the decision was essentially proportionate.


13.  In considering the Immigration Rules the Judge  had  particular  regard
    to materials relating to the income  of  both  the  Appellant  and  her
    husband.  It is apparent that most of the  materials  referred  to  are
    materials that post-date the date of the application, and as such  were
    not part of the application.  In this context it is to be recalled that
    there was a period of approximately  10  months  between  the  date  of
    application and the date of the Respondent's decision  -  at  least  in
    part because of the Respondent's policy to 'suspend'  consideration  of
    such applications pending consideration of MM (Lebanon) by the  Supreme
    Court.  During this period the Appellant's husband received a  P60  for
    the year ending 5 April 2017 that showed that his earnings for that tax
    year did indeed just overcome the �18,600 hurdle, being �18,753; whilst
    this document was relied upon on appeal it was necessarily not included
    in  the  original  application,  and  seemingy  not  forwarded  to  the
    Respondent prior to the decision.


14.  The Decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  includes  discussion  of  the
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE - the 'specified evidence' requirements.
    The discussion encompasses in particular a letter from the  Appellant's
    husband's employer Window Warehouse,  (see  paragraphs  9,  13  and  in
    particular 14).


15.  The Judge made findings to the effect that both  at  the  date  of  the
    Respondent's decision and currently  the  Appellant  could  demonstrate
    that combined earnings were in excess of the required  threshold  under
    the Rules: see for example at paragraph 20:


         "It is clear that at the date of the decision and date  of  hearing
         the Appellant does meet the minimum financial  requirement  of  the
         Rules.  It is also clear that their combined  income  for  the  tax
         year to 5 April 2016 was �25,232 although they  failed  to  provide
         specified evidence of it as required under the Rules.   Since  then
         they have continued to earn over the minimum required  of  �18,600.
         I find there are  exceptional  circumstances  in  this  case  which
         justify that I consider Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules".


16.  The Judge went on to consider  Article  8,  but  reached  a  conclusion
    adverse to the Appellant.   In  this  regard  the  Judge  appropriately
    directed herself to the five stage Razgar test and the public  interest
    considerations: see paragraphs 21 and 22.  The Judge was  satisfied  in
    respect of the first four Razgar questions (paragraphs 22 and 23).


17.  In respect of the fifth  Razgar  question,  proportionality  the  Judge
    observed:


         "There is no doubt that the interest of a private  or  family  life
         would not usually prevail over the interest of immigration control.
          Article 8 does not entail a general  obligation  for  a  state  to
         respect an immigrant's choice of the country of  residence  in  its
         territory.  The inability to meet the Rules is a weighty factor  to
         be considered.  The inability of the Appellant to meet the Rules is
         a weighty factor  and  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
         controls is in the public interest codified in section 117  of  the
         2002 Act" (paragraph 24).


18.   The  Judge  went  on  to  consider  questions  of  social   ties   and
    relationships at paragraph 25.  In this context the  Judge  noted  that
    the Appellant had established her private life and family life  in  the
    United Kingdom at a time when she would have  known  that  it  was  not
    certain that she would be able  to  continue  to  live  in  the  United
    Kingdom -bearing in mind that  she  was  essentially  on  a  period  of
    'probationary leave' as a spouse, and it would be necessary to  satisfy
    the Rules at the end of that period of leave in order to secure further
    leave to remain as a spouse.  In  the  context  of  the  Appellant  not
    having met the requirements of the Rules, the Judge commented:

         "There is nothing to prevent the sponsor [the Appellant's  husband]
         visiting India to see the Appellant and [the  Appellant]  making  a
         fresh application with the specified evidence".


19.  At paragraph 26 the Judge went on  to  reiterate  that  "The  Appellant
    does not meet the requirement of the Rules", before  adding  that  "the
    public policy in requiring her to apply from abroad is not the  only  a
    matter weighing in the Respondent's side of the balance".  Paragraph 26
    continues:

         "Return to India to make an  application  for  entry  clearance  is
         proportionate as there are no circumstances that show such a course
         of action would be unreasonable or unduly harsh. There has been  no
         evidence before me that could lead to a conclusion that her removal
         to India from  where  she  would  make  an  application  for  entry
         clearance to return as a spouse in her right  to  respect  for  her
         family and private life as a woman married to a man with indefinite
         leave to remain in the UK and working in the UK is  anything  other
         than proportionate to the competing public interest issues. I'm not
         satisfied on the facts of this case that there are any  exceptional
         circumstances at all to justify granting leave  to  remain  outside
         the rules stop the removal of the appellant  would  not  be  unduly
         harsh. The decision is proportionate. In  those  circumstances  the
         public interest does require the removal of the appellant."


20.  The challenge to the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  very  much
    focuses on the findings to the effect that  the  Appellant's  financial
    circumstances at the date of the Respondent's decision - and continuing
    to date - were sufficient to meet the threshold under  the  Immigration
    Rules.


21.   However,  as  Ms  Amin  very  fairly  acknowledged,   the   difficulty
    encountered by such a line of argument is not limited to the  issue  of
    'specified evidence'.  The starting point under the Rules  is  not  the
    situation at the date of the decision made by the Respondent,  but  the
    date of the Appellant's application.


22.  The materials submitted with the application comprised  an  application
    form and three different sets of documents, which are reproduced in the
    Respondent's bundle at Annexes A, B and C.  Annex A contains pay slips,
    both in respect of the Appellant and her husband; Annex B contains bank
    statements in respect of the Appellant and also joint  bank  statements
    for the Appellant and her husband; and Annex C is  a  letter  dated  19
    October 2016 from the Appellant's husband's employer Windows Warehouse.




23.  The  application  form  contains  an  assertion  that  the  Appellant's
    husband's earnings at the date of the application amounted  to  �20,016
    per  annum.   Reference  is  made  in  the  application  form  to  past
    employment of the Appellant, but in this context it is  indicated  that
    she had recently lost her job; as such, at the date of the  application
    the Appellant was not  earning  at  all  and  in  this  regard  nothing
    specific further was cited in the relevant section as to her  level  of
    earnings as something to be taken into account in meeting the  specific
    financial requirement.


24.  The difficulty that becomes manifest  upon  consideration  of  the  pay
    slips that were submitted  with  the  application  in  respect  of  the
    Appellant's husband is that they quite simply do not add up to a  level
    of earnings commensurate with that claimed in the application form. Nor
    do they even add up to  a  level  of  gross  earnings  that  meets  the
    threshold in respect of the Rules.  Pay slips were submitted for the 12
    month period covering October 2015 to September  2016.   Two  such  pay
    slips for the months of June and July 2016 were missing; however it  is
    possible to see those pay slips in documents submitted with the  Notice
    of Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, and it is also apparent from  the
    bank statements that monies were received by the Appellant's husband in
    those  months  from  his  employer  commensurate  with  the  pay  slips
    subsequently submitted.  Even  putting  aside  the  omission  from  the
    sequence of documents (which if there were any merit in the application
    was a matter that could readily have been remedied by the  Respondent's
    decision-maker  invoking  the  evidential  flexibility  provisions   of
    Appendix FM-SE), the  total  for  the  6  months  up  to  the  date  of
    application comes to �7,914.96; for the 12 months up to the application
    the total comes to �14,674.79.  As I say, although  the  Appellant  had
    indicated that she had been earning she acknowledged that she  was  not
    earning at the date of the application; she did not  otherwise  provide
    supporting evidence of her earnings with the  application;  accordingly
    there was no further income shown in the application  to  combine  with
    her husband's earnings.


25.  The bank statements essentially confirmed  the  net  levels  of  income
    shown on Appellant's husband's pay slips.   The  employer's  letter  at
    Annex C was not compliant with the requirements of Appendix FM-SE -  as
    was noted by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  Whilst  if  the  level  of
    earnings had been adequate to meet the threshold  it  might  have  been
    open to invoke the evidential flexibility provisions to  disregard  the
    defect in the employer's letter, the reality  was  that  the  level  of
    earnings shown on the pay slips submitted with the application was  not
    sufficient to meet the requirement of the Rules.


26.  In all such circumstances the - albeit brief  -  conclusion  stated  in
    the 'reasons for refusal' letter as regards the financial  requirements
    is adequately clear and adequately reasoned.


27.  Once it is acknowledged that the application could not  have  succeeded
    on the basis on which it was made to the  Respondent,  the  Appellant's
    appeal to this Tribunal runs  into  significant  difficulties.   Albeit
    that the focus of the exploration of the facts  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was on earnings that could be demonstrated  by  evidence  that
    post-dated the application, the reality was - as the Judge in substance
    found - the application failed under the Rules.


28.   That  leaves,  then,  a  consideration  of  the  Judge's  approach  to
    proportionality.   In  my  judgement   in   circumstances   where   the
    application could not succeed under  the  Rules,  and  where  -  absent
    particular circumstances - the Rules are generally compliant  with  the
    obligation to respect Article 8 rights, it was open  to  the  Judge  to
    conclude as he did on proportionality. Indeed in this regard, once  the
    income  level  demonstrated  by  the  documents  submitted   with   the
    application  had  been   calculated   and   shown   to   be   deficient
    (notwithstanding the findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge based on
    later documents and a later date  of  calculation),  Ms  Amin  did  not
    pursue the appeal with any vigour.


29.  Article 8 is not a panacea for a deficient application;  remedy  for  a
    deficient application will ordinarily appropriately be made by making a
    new application, and it  will  not  generally  be  disproportionate  to
    expect an applicant to purse such a course rather than embarking on  an
    appeal


30.  Indeed the Judge  observed  that  it  was  open  to  the  Appellant  to
    reapply. The Appellant may want to take some comfort from the  positive
    findings as to income levels expressed in the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.


31.  Further, it is clear from  Appendix  FM  that  the  immigration  status
    requirements of the Rules need not defeat an application  made  by  the
    Appellant subsequent to these proceedings - providing that  application
    is made in good time.  The immigration  status  requirements  are  such
    that whilst an applicant must not be in the UK in breach of immigration
    laws,  any  period  of  overstaying  will  be  disregarded  if  it   is
    encompassed by paragraph 39E of the Rules.  This effectively gives  the
    Appellant a degree of leeway to make an application subsequent  to  the
    termination of the statutorily extended leave that she enjoys by virtue
    of this appeal.


32.  Be that as it may, and although the Judge has  made  positive  findings
    as to actual income levels, nonetheless it is likely that the Appellant
    will still have to demonstrate to the Secretary of State that  she  has
    specified evidence that complies with the requirements of Appendix  FM-
    SE. However, in due course and as appropiate, no doubt the Secretary of
    State will have regard to the fact that a Judge  of  the  Tribunal  was
    sufficiently persuaded having heard from both  the  Appellant  and  her
    husband that they were genuine as to  their  evidence  with  regard  to
    levels of earnings.


33.  However, for the reasons given, it was open to the  Judge  to  conclude
    that the proportionate response to the failure to meet the Rules was to
    expect the Appellant to reapply with the appropriate  documentation  to
    demonstrate that she could meet the Rules;  'proportionality'  did  not
    require that the appeal be allowed on Article 8 grounds. There  was  no
    error of law.


Notice of Decision

34.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error of  law,  and
    accordingly stands.


35.  The appeal remains dismissed.


36.  No anonymity direction is sought or made.



The above represents a corrected transcript of ex tempore  reason  given  at
the conclusion of the hearing.
