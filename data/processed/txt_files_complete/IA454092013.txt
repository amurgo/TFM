                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     No representation
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is  an  appeal  brought  with  permission  granted  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal by the appellant, Mr Murtaza,  against  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  his  appeal  by  reference  to   the
    Immigration Rules and also by reference to Article 8  of  the  European
    Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
     I noted there is no appearance before  me  by  or  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant.  From his side there is no  explanation  for  that  absence.
    There is however an explanation provided by Mr Bramble who  appears  on
    behalf of the respondent.  He has  shown  me  extracts  from  the  Home
    Office  print-out  regarding  exits  from  the  United  Kingdom,  which
    indicate that the appellant left the United Kingdom earlier this  year.
    In the circumstances, therefore,  by  reason  of  section  104  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, his appeal is  deemed  to
    be abandoned and I so record.



                               Signed   Date 21 November 2014


                               Upper Tribunal Judge Peter Lane
