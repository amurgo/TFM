Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Swain, Counsel, instructed by Eagles Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant, a national  of  India,  date  of  birth  17  July  1990,
    appealed against the Respondent's decisions dated 24 January  2014,  to
    refuse an application for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student
    Migrant under the points-based system and to  make  removal  directions
    with reference to Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality
    Act 2006.

2.   Permission to appeal was given  by  FtTJ  Hollingworth  on  21  January
    2015.  Directions were given on 16 February 2015.  On 1 April 2015  the
    error of law hearing before me went part heard.

3.   A resumed hearing on 15 September 2015 was not  concluded  because  the
    respondent raised new issues including a claimed Notice of  Curtailment
    (20/6/2012) and s.10 removal directions 28  July  2014  not  previously
    raised at the 1 April 2015 hearing.  I gave directions for documents to
    be served by the Respondent on the Appellant and for any reply  by  the
    Appellant by  6  November  2015.   There  was  non-compliance  with  my
    directions by the Respondent: No  explanation  was  given.   A  renewed
    hearing was listed for 26 November 2015 but was postponed to  29  March
    2016.

4.   The  basis  of  the  refusal  was  that  no  points  were  awarded  for
    "attributes" because a Confirmation of  Acceptance  for  Studies  (CAS)
    which the Appellant had used with reference number  E4G6DX4C13L0T5  had
    been withdrawn by the sponsoring college; known as Essex  College.   It
    was clear from the reasons for refusal that following  the  application
    enquiries had been made by the Home Office UK Visas and Immigration  in
    Sheffield of the college and had been told  by  the  college  that  the
    Appellant had

         "stopped attending the course despite several warnings".


    The Respondent concluded:-
         "As such you are not in possession of a valid CAS and so  you  have
         not met the requirements of the Rules."

5.   It followed, in the absence of a valid CAS, no points were awarded  for
    maintenance.   An appeal was made against those reasons and the grounds
    of appeal show that the Appellant challenged the allegation reported to
    the Respondent by Essex College in that he stated

         "I enrolled at Essex College to pursue my further studies, where  I
         paid my first year's fees in full  before  applying  for  my  visa.
         Later when I started studying the college started asking  for  more
         money in the form of next  year's  fees  which  was  not  mentioned
         earlier.  When I refused to do so and  asked  them  to  report  the
         issue to UKBA they reported me instead and asked me not  to  attend
         the college.  I want to raise this issue as Essex College is giving
         all its students very hard time. I kindly request you to look at my
         case with discretion and allow me to study further. Also take steps
         where other students don't become victim of these situations."

    Those  grounds  are  dated  somewhere  around  28  January  2014.   The
    Appellant did not know what Essex College had told the  Respondent  nor
    that the CAS letter had been withdrawn.

6.   The case file does not contain  any  notice  of  hearing   or  copy  of
    notice of hearing nor any returned copy  by  the  Post  Office  of  the
    notice of hearing for that before First-tier Tribunal Judge Dineen (the
    judge) on 20 October 2014 : On what basis  he  thought  the  Notice  of
    Hearing was given I cannot tell.

7.   The judge in his decision promulgated on 4 November 2014  recorded  the
    basis of the Secretary of State's refusal, the fact of an appeal  being
    made and stated that the Appellant had not appeared at the hearing, did
    not give any adequate explanation for the absence of a valid CAS and he
    did not file any evidence or submissions.  The judge was satisfied that
    the Appellant had been notified of the hearing and concluded  that  the
    interests of justice required  the  hearing  to  proceed.   Inevitably,
    given the absence of evidence of a CAS  the  appeal  would  fail.   The
    judge did not for understandable reasons address the grounds of appeal.

8.   The first challenge  to  the  decision  of  the  judge  was  procedural
    unfairness occasioned by  the  Appellant  not  being  informed  of  the
    hearing by his representative who was said to act for him and  yet  had
    no active involvement therefore in the  preparation  of  the  necessary
    case that would have been expected nor the notice from the IAC.

9.   In a witness statement, dated 9  March  2015,  the  Appellant  set  out
    something of the history of the matter to which I will return.

10.   When permission was granted to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  the
    Secretary of State made a Rule 24  response  on  4  February  2015  and
    essentially  raised  three  points.   First,  the  judge  appropriately
    addressed the issue. Secondly, in  the  absence  of  any  corroborative
    evidence that the Appellant's representative did not advise  him  of  a
    hearing, the Secretary of State did not accept that there was any basis
    for an appeal.  Thirdly, the judge made no error of law.

11.  Given the lack of any documentation relating  to  the  service  of  the
    notice of hearing for 20 October 2014, its absence from the  case  file
    and the absence of any endorsement on the case file as to a  notice  of
    hearing having been  sent  out,  I  only  have  the  statement  of  the
    Appellant who stated he did not know about the hearing:  The  Appellant
    was in contact with someone known as Karan, who is not a solicitor  and
    may or may not be qualified and recognised by  OISC.   Either  way  the
    Appellant's case was that he was not aware of what was going on  vis-�-
    vis his appeal and he did not receive correspondence from the Tribunal.
     In the circumstances it was unclear what if any notice was ever  given
    to Karan and also there was no  evidence  of  the  Appellant  accepting
    receipt of relevant correspondence from the IAC.

12.  It is difficult to see what evidence the  Appellant  could  produce  to
    corroborate a failure to receive a notice of hearing.  Mr Tufan  relied
    upon the case of BT (Nepal)  [2004]  UKIAT  00311,  in  particular  the
    general expectation, explained by the UKIAT as it then was, that is not
    good enough just to criticise solicitors, rather the  point  should  be
    made to them and they should be offered  the  opportunity  to  respond.
    Such was the means by which one can be satisfied, assuming  they  reply
    to such correspondence, that they had failed to act  as  claimed  by  a
    disappointed Appellant.

13.  The general proposition in BT holds good. The question here is  not  so
    much should that proposition be applied  but  the  circumstances  where
    Karan was not OISC approved representative.  If  any  firm  existed  or
    still exist, is extremely difficult to say.  Doing the best I can  with
    the material I have got, and where  the  Secretary  of  State  has  not
    challenged the Appellant's witness statement in substance or at all  by
    way of submissions, I am satisfied that there is at least  evidence  to
    show first, that there is no  correspondence  with  the  Tribunal  from
    Karan about the matter and there was  no  correspondence  alerting  the
    Tribunal to the fact that Karan was not acting or not qualified to  act
    or otherwise unable to act at the material times.

14.  I am satisfied that notice of the  date,  time  and  place  of  hearing
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Dineen was not given to or received by
    the Appellant and there is nothing to indicate that anything  was  sent
    by the Tribunal to the Appellant or Karan  concerning  the  hearing  on
    that date.  If a part of the case file has become lost  then  that  may
    explain the absence of material but I see no reason in the light of all
    the other material which is contained on the file to assume that a  few
    pages have somehow or other become lost.

15.  In those circumstances therefore I  was  satisfied  that  there  was  a
    procedural error of law and that on this basis the Original  Tribunal's
    decision cannot stand.

16.  The Secretary of State at the resumed  hearing  on  15  September  2015
    sought to  raise  two  immigration  decisions,  not  previously  raised
    relating to:- first, a claimed  decision  to  Curtail  the  Appellant's
    leave; and  secondly,  a  decision  to  make  Removal  Directions  with
    reference to Section 10 of the IAA 1969: These took the  Appellant  and
    his representatives by surprise and  were  strongly  disputed  as  ever
    happening.   These matters having been raised by the Senior  Presenting
    Officer, Mr Kandola, but without any evidence being properly served led
    to the   hearing  being  adjourned:  A  previous  hearing  having  been
    adjourned  because  of  failure  to  comply  with  directions  by   the
    Respondent.  Nevertheless I gave the  opportunity  to  the  Respondent,
    with directions given at the hearing, to provide the  evidence  of  the
    decisions; with evidence of any address provided  for  service  on  the
    Appellant and any evidence the decisions of 20 June 2012  and  28  July
    2014  were actually sent out to the Appellant.

17.  I wish to be entirely  clear  this  was  no  criticism  of  Mr  Tufan's
    conduct of the hearing but it is plain that there was,  from  September
    2015, ample opportunity for the Secretary of  State  to  either  comply
    with the directions or to notify the Tribunal why directions  were  not
    being complied with.  Mr Tufan was only very recently in receipt of the
    relevant files and did the best he could in the short time available to
    acquire some  of  the  documents  but  even  these  did  not  fully  or
    effectively meet the directions given.  He therefore has  no  evidence,
    other than the notices themselves, which are dated, to show that  there
    has been the service of them, let alone where the documents were  sent.
    The Respondent has no post book or other  paper  or  electronic  record
    maintained to record such matters. I note the  abject  and  unexplained
    failures of the Secretary of State, bearing in  mind  two  adjournments
    amounting to just about a year in total, have delayed the consideration
    of this appeal.

18.  Quite how it can be  said  that  the  Respondent  was  properly  either
    assisting  the  Tribunal  at  meeting  the  overriding   objective   or
    represented the cooperation expected of the Respondent to an appeal,  I
    do not know.  Seemingly no explanation will ever be  forthcoming  about
    those repeated failures and unnecessary delays.

19.  Thus whether or not notice  was  ever  given  to  the  Curtailment  and
    Removal Directions is unknown. Yet a further issue was then  raised  at
    the  hearing  that  the  Appellant  had  been   involved   in   falsely
    participating in English language examination  referred  to  as  "ETS".
    These wholly new points did not feature  in  the  Reasons  for  Refusal
    Letter of 24 January 2014. There is no explanation  why  if  they  were
    relevant, they were not referred to at the material time.

20.  I find they did not form a consideration before FtT Judge Dineen, I  do
    not find, those matters not being referred to by the judge, represented
    any error of law. They were  simply  an  ad  hoc  approach  during  the
    conduct of the appeal by another Senior Presenting Officer to raise new
    issues.  In the absence of the  particulars  which  I  directed  to  be
    provided I am not satisfied that it would be fair to consider them  now
    nor would it meet the overriding objective of the Procedure Rules,  nor
    to do so would it be anything other than acquiescence in  a  lamentable
    failure by the Respondent to comply with the directions  and  belatedly
    raise a new issue.

21.    Accordingly, I indicated, having heard argument,  that  I  would  not
    proceed to  hear  this  appeal  based  upon  the  Curtailment,  Removal
    Directions  or ETS issues, nor had any permission been  given  on  such
    grounds, nor was there any application to amend the grounds made to  me
    nor were they raised with the Judge nor their relevance to the appeal's
    outcome or demonstrate the judge's decision would have been to  dismiss
    the appeal in any event.   It seemed to me that if those matters are to
    be pursued they will  have  to  be  when  a  further  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State is made.

22.  Also relied upon on by the Appellant was the failure by the  Respondent
    to take steps, as recorded in the immigration decision, to make  proper
    enquiries of Essex College and/or the Appellant  about  the  CAS  being
    withdrawn.  It was clear that in seeking to streamline and speed up PBS
    decisions that the Secretary of  State  has  done  much  to  make  that
    process  faster  and  has  introduced  a  CAS  Checking  Service.   The
    Secretary of State has also in  the  relevant  period  been  active  in
    reviewing colleges, which have the status to issue CAS letters, and has
    taken active steps against colleges by way of  suspending  or  removing
    their registration.

23.  The case of EK (Ivory Coast) [2014] EWCA Civ 1517 Mr Tufan regarded  as
    a "killer" point: The case addressed the question of the consequence of
    there being no CAS letter or any CAS letter  being  withdrawn,  for  an
    applicant.  EK confirmed that the absence of CAS letter is  essentially
    fatal to any appeal and the obvious recourse is  for  an  applicant  to
    remove from the UK and to apply again, to return to study.

24.  However what was clear from EK was that fairness required  a  Secretary
    of State to give an applicant an opportunity  to  address  grounds  for
    refusal which he did not know and could not have known, failing  which,
    as the Tribunal said, the resulting decision may be set aside on appeal
    as contrary to law.  On the basis of that principle an Appellant may be
    given   notice  of  a  problem  with  a  CAS  letter  or  a   college's
    registration and have an opportunity to deal with it.

25.  At paragraphs 41 and 42 of EK, Lord Justice  Sales  recognised,  as  it
    was put, that there  may  be  circumstances,  matters  which  are  fact
    sensitive and would have to  be  determined,  so  that  notwithstanding
    there being some appropriate information  given  to  the  Secretary  of
    State about problems with the application, there may  be  circumstances
    where it is appropriate for an applicant to be informed of  a  negative
    reply and to be asked for comments which addressed the  adequacy  of  a
    college's response giving rise to the need for some further enquiry  by
    the Secretary of State.

26.  Lord Justice Floyd at paragraphs 45 to 51 of EK  concluded  that  there
    may be circumstances where the Secretary of State gives an  opportunity
    to an applicant to comment on information arising.    The  decision  of
    Lord Justice Briggs at paragraph 59 of EK does  not  essentially  demur
    from that  but  plainly  he  was  not  encouraging  the  generality  of
    reopening such applications absent of there being a proper reason to do
    so.

27.  There was no doubt in this case, as the Secretary of State's Notice  of
    Immigration Decision confirmed, an enquiry was made by  the  Respondent
    but she did not inform the Appellant of the outcome or college's reply.



28.  The Appellant lodged evidence in support of the appeal,  which  I  have
    already referred to, in which  he  challenged  the  reasons  the  Essex
    College gave for the withdrawal of the CAS letter.  He  challenged  the
    claimed failure to attend Essex College by him and the absence  of  any
    evidence of his failure to  attend:  For  example  by  way  of  college
    records or  confirmation of the number of days that the  Appellant  had
    'failed' to attend the college.  Therefore it was wholly unclear on his
    unchallenged version of the facts, on what basis the college had proper
    reasons to withdraw  the  CAS.   The  Secretary  of  State,  which  was
    unchallenged, gave no notice of this matter to  the  Appellant  at  any
    stage before the decision of the Secretary of State; which was  unfair,
    argued Mr Swain.

29.  Also relied upon by Mr Swain, in his  detailed  and  evidently  correct
    summary of the history  of  the  case,  were  extracts  from  published
    guidance provided by the  Secretary  of  State  to  registered  sponsor
    colleges.  The Secretary of State advised CAS Sponsors  on  what  basis
    they may cancel a CAS.  It was argued by Mr Swain, if the Secretary  of
    State had been following her own guidance,  considering  the  college's
    response in cancelling or withdrawal of the  Appellant's  CAS,  as  the
    guidance suggests, it is apparent that nothing was done as expected  to
    inform the Appellant.   Rather  the  Respondent's  decision  was  taken
    simply without further ado; assuming there was a proper basis  for  the
    college to have withdrawn the CAS: Even though  there  was  nothing  to
    suggest  apparently  that  the  applicant  student   had   been   given
    notification of it by  the  College.   In  addition  the  Secretary  of
    State's direction to CAS Sponsors is that if a  CAS  is  withdrawn  the
    college must notify the student. (My emphasis)  Even if "must"  is  not
    mandatory, it is clearly relevant to fairness.

30.  Mr Tufan says "well that is  as  well  may  be  but  the  fact  is  the
    complaint, the Appellant has, is with his college".  They were the ones
    who withdrew the CAS. They are the ones responsible and "they have left
    him in the position where he cannot successfully apply to remain".   In
    most respects I agree with Mr Tufan but where I disagree with  him  for
    it was plain the Secretary of State had not ascertained  and  certainly
    did  not say so if she did, that any notice of this has been  given  to
    the Appellant  in  advance  of  the  Respondent's  decision..   On  the
    contrary, the Appellant's  unchallenged  evidence  insofar  as  he  can
    prove  a negative, was that he was not told.  He thinks to the best  of
    his knowledge that the withdrawal of the CAS was motivated by the greed
    of the College seeking to obtain more money in advance than that  which
    they were entitled to or had been agreed.  The fact  that  the  college
    has apparently gone out of business, I  disregard  as  confirmatory  of
    that, but rather, I accept the unchallenged evidence of  the  Appellant
    of what happened to him.

31.  In these circumstances I am satisfied, were  it  necessary  to  do  so,
    that the Secretary of State in failing to follow her published guidance
    and/or take the opportunity to notify  the  Appellant  in  the  factual
    circumstances which I have set out above amounted to an error  of  law,
    in the Secretary of State's decision on attributes.

32.  I do not criticise the  judge,  but  it  demonstrated  that  the  whole
    approach to the Secretary of State's decision, as expressed through the
    Notice of Immigration Decision, was flawed in law by failing to  follow
    the published guidance and/or unfair  in  the  failure  to  inform  the
    Appellant as contemplated in EK.

33.  I am satisfied the Original Tribunal's decision cannot  stand  and  the
    Respondent's  decision  was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law.   The
    appropriate course is for this matter to be returned to  the  Secretary
    of State to make a decision in accordance with the law.

34.  Further, whilst I make no directions about it, it is evident  that  the
    Secretary of State will, in looking at this matter, need  to  give  the
    Appellant some time to find a college and see whether he can  obtain  a
    CAS letter bearing in mind he now has no status to remain  and  make  a
    further application.  At the present time almost inevitably  a  college
    will be unwilling to ascribe a CAS letter to the Appellant who  has  no
    leave to remain:  This problem will be a matter for  the  Secretary  of
    State before reviewing  the  decision  made,  there  being  no  sponsor
    college in existence, no possibility to take up that CAS letter  again.
    The Appellant may need some leave or time to obtain another CAS.  It is
    for the Secretary of State on what basis she wishes to  engage  with  a
    proper consideration of the application.

35.  No anonymity order is made.

Decision

35.  The Original Tribunal decision can not stand. The appeal is allowed  to
    the extent it is returned to the Secretary of State to make a  decision
    in accordance with the law.

FEE AWARD

The Appellant has incurred significant costs. I would propose to make a  fee
award in the sum of �140.
