                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant, a citizen of Poland, appeals against the  determination
      of an Adjudicator (Mr R B L Prior) who, in a determination promulgated
      on 26 February 2003, dismissed her  appeal,  in  her  absence,  having
      refused to  grant  her  application  for  an  adjournment  on  medical
      grounds, against the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  on  19
      September 2002, refusing to grant her  application  for  asylum  under
      paragraph 336 of HC395 (as amended)  and  giving  directions  for  her
      removal from the United Kingdom to Poland.

2.    The appellant was represented by Mr A Fisher  of  Counsel,  instructed
      by Anooma & Co, Solicitors, while Ms K Evans, Home  Office  Presenting
      Officer, represented the Secretary of State.

3.    The grounds of appeal in this matter, firstly, challenge  the  finding
      of the Adjudicator on account  of  his  having  refused  to  grant  an
      adjournment to the appellant despite the presence of a medical  report
      to the effect that the appellant was unable  to  attend  the  hearing.
      The  grounds  of  appeal  also  challenge  the  determination  of  the
      Adjudicator on the ground that his failure to grant the  appellant  an
      adjournment affected the outcome of her appeal  in  material  respects
      and also challenge the findings  of  the  Adjudicator  in  that  while
      taking account of the decision  of  the  Tribunal  in  Kweik,  he  had
      misunderstood the test of  sufficiency  of  protection  as  stated  in
      Horvath,in   not  taking  account  of  Souad  Noune,  and   that   the
      determination was flawed in that he  had  not  taken  account  of  the
      objective evidence, and had wrongly come to the conclusion that  there
      was sufficiency of protection.

4.    Leave to appeal to the Tribunal  was  granted  by  the  Tribunal  (His
      Honour Judge Huskinson, Vice President) on 9 June 2003.

5.    In granting leave to appeal, the Tribunal has stated as follows:

           "It is reasonably arguable that the Adjudicator may  have  erred
           in failing to grant an adjournment on the basis  of  the  letter
           from Dr Mark Sarnicki dated 2 February 2003.   Bearing  in  mind
           however, the contents of this letter,  the  claimant  should  be
           prepared at  any  hearing  to  argue  why  the  Adjudicator  was
           mistaken in stating


                 "I found that the report  did  not  persuade  me  that  the
                 Appellant was sufficiently seriously unwell to be unable to
                 attend the hearing."


           In particular, the claimant should be able to argue whether  the
           doctor's report indicates anything more than sickness because of
           anxiety regarding the forthcoming appeal hearing  and  (if  not)
           how such sickness is sufficient justification for postponing the
           appeal hearing."

6.    When the appeal opened before the Tribunal  on  2  October  2003,  the
      Tribunal had, before it, a bundle of documents submitted on behalf  of
      the appellant, which contained  a  copy  of  the  doctor's  letter  in
      respect of the refused adjournment.

7.    We heard Mr Fisher who argued the  grounds  of  appeal  and  submitted
      that, in the light of the doctor's letter, in which  he  had  set  out
      clearly that the appellant was unwell and unable to attend the hearing
      on 7 February and  asked  that  the  hearing  should  be  re-scheduled
      pending  stabilisation  of  the  appellant's  condition.   Mr   Fisher
      submitted that the Adjudicator had not taken full account of what  the
      doctor had stated and the reasons for seeking the adjournment and that
      he has not given any reasons why he had come to  the  conclusion  that
      the doctor's report had not  persuaded  him  that  the  appellant  was
      sufficiently seriously unwell to be unable to attend the hearing.   He
      submitted that the Adjudicator had reached  a  conclusion,  about  the
      medical evidence, which he was not  entitled  to  do,  as  he  has  no
      medical  experience.   He  submitted  that  the  medical  report   was
      sufficient evidence upon which to have  granted  the  adjournment  and
      that the Adjudicator had erred in not granting it.

8.    Mr Fisher submitted that the Adjudicator  had  not  properly  followed
      the legal procedure as laid down in Rule 31 of the Procedure Rules and
      that the appeal should be allowed.

9.    We then  heard  Ms  Evans,  in  reply,  and  she  submitted  that  the
      Adjudicator properly considered the medical evidence before  him,  and
      it is clear from the medical evidence itself that the doctor  had  not
      given any detailed reasons why the appellant was unfit and not able to
      attend the hearing.  She submitted that, looking at the reasons  given
      by the Tribunal in granting leave to appeal,  the  appellant  had  not
      argued whether  the  doctor's  report  indicated  anything  more  than
      sickness because of anxiety regarding the forthcoming  appeal  hearing
      and had not shown how such sickness was sufficient  justification  for
      postponing  the  appeal  hearing.   She   submitted   that,   in   the
      circumstances, the Adjudicator had not usurped  the  function  of  the
      doctor, had acted judicially under the Rules, and  that  his  decision
      ought not be overturned.

10.   We then heard Mr Fisher, in reply.

11.   The Tribunal then adjourned for a short time in order to consider  the
      submissions made to it.

12.   When the Tribunal resumed, we stated, in open court, that  we  allowed
      the appeal as, the Tribunal was loath to interfere with a  finding  of
      an Adjudicator on a matter such as this, nevertheless, in view of  the
      fact that, in refusing to grant the adjournment, where the Adjudicator
      had stated that the medical report  did  not  persuade  him  that  the
      appellant was sufficiently seriously unwell to be unable to attend the
      hearing, he did not address his mind to the question of whether or not
      refusing the adjournment  would  prevent  the  just  disposal  of  the
      appeal, as required under Rule 31(1) of  the  Immigration  and  Asylum
      Appeals (Procedure)  Rules 2000.  We so found, as it would  appear  to
      us that, reading the evidence and the  grounds  of  appeal,  it  would
      appear that there were  a  number  of  points  in  the  evidence,  for
      example, the statement by the appellant that her parents had travelled
      in and out of Poland, which could have a serious effect on their claim
      to have been persecuted in Poland, which points  the  appellant  could
      clear up only in evidence before the Adjudicator. We were of the  view
      that, while the Adjudicator was not persuaded that the  appellant  was
      sufficiently seriously unwell to be unable to attend the  hearing,  he
      had not considered the question of the just disposal of the case,  and
      further, he did not give any reason why he was not persuaded that  the
      appellant was sufficiently seriously unwell to be unable to attend the
      hearing, as it would seem from the doctor's report that, not alone did
      the doctor prescribe appropriate medication  for  the  appellant,  but
      gave instructions for her to be reviewed in two weeks, which two weeks
      had not expired, before the date of the hearing, on 7 February.

13.   In all these circumstances, we found that for  the  Adjudicator  ought
      to have granted the adjournment applied for and, in open court, in the
      presence of the representatives and of the appellant, we allowed  this
      appeal, set aside the determination of the Adjudicator   and  directed
      that the appeal be heard afresh before an Adjudicator other than Mr  R
      B L Prior, and that the  appellant  should  attend  that  hearing  and
      present her case without seeking any further adjournments, unless  for
      very good reason indeed.

14.   This appeal is, accordingly, allowed, but only to the extent  that  it
      is directed that it be heard afresh before a different Adjudicator  at
      as early a date as possible.
