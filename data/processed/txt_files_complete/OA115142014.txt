                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. In this  appeal,  the   Entry  Clearance  Officer   appeals  against  a
    decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the  appeal  of   Mrs
    Igbineweka ('the claimant') who appealed against a decision taken on  1
    September 2014 to refuse her entry clearance as a spouse under appendix
    FM.

Background Facts

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Nigeria who was born on 10 November  1985.
    She applied for entry clearance as a spouse under appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules HC395 (as amended).   That  application  was  refused
    because the Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that she met  the
    income threshold or the related evidential requirements under  appendix
    FM-SE.

The Appeal

 3. The claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In  a  determination
    promulgated on 14  May  2015  Judge  Plumptre  allowed  the  claimant's
    appeal.  The First-tier Tribunal found that the Entry Clearance manager
    had overlooked a third P60 which was  submitted  with  the  grounds  of
    appeal. She found that the claimant had established that the  financial
    requirements had been met.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 4. The Entry Clearance Officer sought permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  On 20 July 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge McDade granted the
    Entry Clearance Officer permission to appeal.  Thus,  the  appeal  came
    before me.

Preliminary Issue

 5. Mr Walker raised as a preliminary issue that  the  P60  from  Not  Just
    Cleaning that the claimant relied on ('the third P60') had the tax year
    date missing as a result of being poorly photocopied.  Mr  Airuouo  was
    unable to assist with a complete copy as his copy  also  had  the  date
    missing. I drew attention to the date at the bottom of  the  P60  which
    suggested that the P60 was for the 2013-2014 period although  this  was
    not confirmation of the tax year. I indicated that my preliminary  view
    was that the P60 was not evidence of  the  level  of  earnings  in  the
    relevant period so that this point may not be material. Mr  Walker  was
    content for his observation to be noted.

Summary of the Submissions

 6. The grounds of appeal assert that the judge erred  in  law  in  finding
    that the Sponsor's earnings were in excess  of  �18,600  based  on  the
    Sponsor's P60 in  the  absence  of  the  other  evidence  specified  in
    appendix FM-SE. It was submitted that the P60  may  indicate  that  the
    income is above the threshold but this was not borne out  by  the  bank
    statements, payslips and employers' letters which are either missing or
    which do not add up to the  figure  stated  on  the  P60.  The  further
    evidence was not corroboration of earnings that the sponsor was earning
    at the date of the decision. It is not open to the judge  to  make  the
    findings in the absence of the specified evidence.

 7. With regards to the evidence that the  Sponsor's  child  has  now  been
    issued with a British passport Mr Walker acknowledged that  this  would
    be a contributing factor in  an  assessment  under  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights and that it was a strong factor.

 8. Mr Airuouo relied on his skeleton argument. He submitted that the Entry
    Clearance Officer's powers were discretionary. He referred to paragraph
    D of Appendix FM-SE where it states that the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    may request evidence if there are documents missing from a sequence  of
    documents. He explained that there were two  sets  of  bank  statements
    from 2 different accounts. He submitted  that  the  purpose  of  the  6
    months' payslips was to project earnings but the P60  is  a  Government
    document which states the total earned and the tax paid. If  employment
    remains the same there is no reason to doubt that earnings will change.
    The Sponsor remained in all 3 employments. The third P60 was  the  most
    significant and was omitted  from  the  review.  None  of  the  missing
    documents were requested and the claimant had in addition submitted the
    P60. If the law is to emphatically establish that the Sponsor meets the
    income threshold the claimant has  more  than  demonstrated  that.  The
    skeleton argument makes reference to Appendix FM-SE 2A (i) which refers
    to an applicant being permitted to submit P60s for the relevant  period
    of employment relied on.

 9. With regard to Article 8 Mr Airuouo submitted that the judge considered
    all the evidence in the round to allow the appeal.

10. The Sponsor, who was present at the hearing (Mr  Ewere),  asked  if  he
    could clarify a couple of matters. This was in response to queries that
    I put to his representative regarding the fact that the  pay  from  Not
    Just Cleaning at the date of the decision was significantly  less  than
    the amount earned according to the P60 over the 12  month  period.  The
    Sponsor explained that in January 2014 Not Just Cleaning split into two
    different contracts so he began  doing  two  jobs  for  both  Not  Just
    Cleaning and Property Support Services that is why his income  appeared
    to drop with Not Just cleaning after January. He was  still  doing  the
    same work but now for two employers. He  clarified  that  his  earnings
    from Property Support Services were weekly payments. He  also  referred
    to the bank statements and explained that only one  set  of  statements
    had been taken into account by the Entry Clearance Manager which is why
    the total earning were said to be below the threshold.

11. Mr Walker checked that the  bank  statements  that  the  representative
    handed up for consideration were the  same  statements  that  had  been
    received  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer.  He  indicated  that  the
    clarification from the sponsor was helpful and that it did appear  that
    the confusion regarding the two bank statements led to a  lower  salary
    being found when it was all totalled up.

12. The claimant claimed costs in the event that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    appeal was upheld

Discussion

13. The jurisdiction of this tribunal on  an  appeal  from  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is limited to points of law (s 11 of the Tribunals, Courts and
    Enforcement Act 2007).

14. The claimant relies on Appendix FM-SE A(i) which provides:

         'In respect of salaried employment in the UK (paragraph 2  of  this
         appendix) ... the applicant may, in addition to  the  payslips  and
         personal bank statements required under that paragraph, submit  the
         P60 for the relevant period(s) of employment relied upon ...'

15. It is quite clear from the above paragraph that submission of a P60  is
    in addition to the payslips and bank statements not as  an  alternative
    to the specified evidence.  A P60 is not a Government issued  document,
    it is issued by an employer. The third P60 relied on in this case  was,
    in any event, of limited evidential value. It did not provide  evidence
    of the level of earnings during  the  relevant  period  as  it  covered
    periods prior to the dates in question. It cannot be  ascertained  from
    the P60 what the level of earnings were, and were projected to  be,  at
    the date of the decision. For example a person might work 40 hours  per
    week at the beginning of the year but have a  change  in  contract  and
    work only 20  hours  per  week  from  mid-year  with  the  commensurate
    reduction in salary. The P60 merely records  the  total  earnings  from
    that employer over the 12 month period.  In fact in this case  that  is
    precisely what happened hence Mr Walker's submission that the level  of
    earnings on the P60 from Not Just Cleaning were not borne  out  by  the
    payslips and bank statements.

16. I find that the judge erred in relying on the P60 as evidence that  the
    sponsor was earning in excess of �18,600 in the absence  of  the  other
    specified evidence required in Appendix FM-SE.

17. I  set-aside  the  decision  pursuant  to  paragraph  12(2)(a)  of  the
    Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act 2007

Re-Making the decision

18. As a result of the sponsor's  clarification  it  became  clear  at  the
    hearing that the reason that the Entry  Clearance  Manager  only  found
    that the total of salary payments supported by the bank statements were
    �5,502.28 is that only one set of bank statement appears to  have  been
    taken into account. Salaries were paid into two different bank accounts
    and both sets of bank  statements  had  been  submitted  to  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer. If both sets of bank statements had been  considered
    the net pay amounted to �10,597.31 for the relevant 6 month period i.e.
    December 2013 to May 2014.

19. In this case it is clear that the specified evidence required  had  not
    all been provided - some  payslips  were  missing  and  the  employer's
    letters did not contain all the relevant information. The discretion in
    Appendix FM-SE  D  to  consider  other  documents  submitted  with  the
    application is that of the decision maker not the  First-tier  Tribunal
    or  this  Tribunal.   In  Sultana  and  Others  (rules:  waiver/further
    enquiry; discretion) [2014] UKUT 00540 (IAC) at paragraph 18 the  Upper
    Tribunal when considering the 'evidential flexibility' in  Paragraph  D
    of Appendix FM-SE held:

         '18. ... It is appropriate to add that the discretion  in  question
         is conferred exclusively on the  ECO  and  is  not  exercisable  by
         either the FtT or this Tribunal on appeal.'

20. However, in this case the Entry Clearance Manager, when maintaining the
    Entry Clearance Officer's decision, was prepared to  and  did  consider
    whether or not the threshold requirement of a minimum gross  income  of
    �18,600 was met by evidence from the  bank  statements  confirming  the
    salary payments in the absence of  the  other  specified  corroborating
    evidence in the form of payslips and employer's letters setting out all
    the required information. There appears to have been an error  in  that
    only one set of bank statements were taken into account  by  the  Entry
    Clearance manager. It is evident that, had both sets of statements been
    considered, even on a net amount of  salary  payments  during  the  six
    month  period  the  threshold  of  �18,600  gross  annual  salary   was
    demonstrated as met as �10,597.31 was paid into the  bank  accounts  by
    the claimant's employers over the six month period.

21. There was sufficient evidence before the Entry Clearance Officer in the
    form of the bank statements for the income to be verified as  being  in
    excess of �18,600.

22. The claimant's appeal against the Entry Clearance Officer's decision is
    allowed.

23. No order as to costs is made. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    contained an error of law. The Entry  Clearance  Officer  did  not  act
    unreasonably in bringing these proceedings.

24. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously. Having
    considered all the circumstances and evidence  I  do  not  consider  it
    necessary to make an anonymity direction.

Decision

25.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
    error of law.  I set  aside  that  decision.  I  re-make  the  decision
    allowing the claimant's appeal against the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision.

26. No order as to costs is made.
