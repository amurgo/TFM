                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the respondent but
    nonetheless for the purposes of this appeal I will refer to the parties
    as they were described before the First Tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of France born on 20th April  1994  and  she
    appeals against the respondent's decision dated 9th  December  2013  to
    refuse to issue her with a residence card as confirmation of her  right
    of residence as an EEA national exercising  treaty  rights  in  the  UK
    under European Community Law.

 3. The refusal was made on the basis that she  was  not  a  worker  and  a
    qualified person in the UK  as  detailed  under  Regulation  6  of  the
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006   (the   EEA
    Regulations).

 4. The appellant's application to the respondent  was  made  initially  on
    25th February 2013, the refusal was made on 9th December  2013  on  the
    basis of insufficient proof of economic activity and an  appeal  lodged
    on 19th December 2013.

 5. The appellant claimed that she worked for Med Practice Limited and that
    she had also undertaken self employment.  A tax  return  for  2011-2012
    was submitted.

 6. On 24th March 2014 First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Obhi  2013  allowed  the
    appellant's appeal finding that she  was  a  worker.   The  matter  was
    determined  on  the  papers.   In  the  same  determination  the  judge
    dismissed the appellant's  claimed  husband's  appeal,  (Mr  Babatunder
    Badejo: Appeal No IA/00878.14) and no further  challenge  was  made  in
    that regard.

 7. An application for permission to appeal was made by the  respondent  on
    the basis that the  judge  found  the  evidence  in  relation  to  self
    employment was inadequate but allowed the  appeal  on  the  appellant's
    appeal on the basis that she was a worker.   However  the  judge  noted
    that the most up to date evidence of employment consisted  of  payslips
    for November and December  2013.   There  were  no  corresponding  bank
    statements to show payments actually being made to  the  appellant  but
    stated 'it is clear... that she remains employed'.

 8. The grounds for permission asserted that the judge had given inadequate
    reasons for her finding that the appellant was  in  employment  at  the
    date of the hearing in March 2014 when the only evidence of  employment
    was 3 months out of date.



Conclusions

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge McDade on the basis  that  it
    was  arguable,  as  it   was   asserted,   that   the   payslips   were
    uncorroborated, they were three months out of date and  there  were  no
    corresponding banks statements to  show  that  payments  were  actually
    being made to the bank.

10. At the hearing I showed Mr Deller the evidence, which was on  file  for
    Judge Obhi and Judge McDade to consider and also appeared to have  been
    forwarded to the respondent prior to the determination of  the  appeal.
    This consisted  of  payslips  from  April,  May,  June,  July,  August,
    September, October, November and December 2013.  All bar one  of  those
    payslips referred to the payment being made to the appellant  in  cash.
    The BACs payment reference appeared on the December 2013 payslip.  Only
    bank statements which preceded that payslip were  in  evidence.   There
    was no issue taken with the provenance or authenticity of the documents
    submitted (and I note that they were provided to the  respondent  prior
    to the appeal), and the judge referred to  the  original  Med  Practice
    Limited letter dated 15th March 2013.

11. The judge confirmed at paragraph 15 of her determination

    ''the  first  appellant  has  now  provided  an  original  letter  from
    MedPractice Limited dated the 15th March 2013 offering her the position
    of Office Assistant with effect from the 1 April 2013.  Further she has
    provided two payslips for November and December 2013 from  Medpractice.
    These salary slips suggest that payment was made into a  bank  account.
    The appellant  has  proved  one  original  bank  statement  dated  18th
    February 2012 to 18th  February  2013.   There  appear  to  be  various
    deposits made into the (sic) primarily into the  Oxford  Street  branch
    but there is no evidence of regular payments from an employer.  No bank
    statements beyond that period have been provided.  The balance  in  the
    account on the 18 February  2013  is  ï¿½71.97.   The  only  evidence  of
    economic activity was that which was provided to the respondent at  the
    time of the application, and comprises  of  a  self  assessment  inland
    revenue income tax return....However, it  is  clear  that  she  remains
    employed by Medpractice as an office assistant.  That means that she is
    employed and therefore does meet the requirements of Regulation  6.   I
    am satisfied that she is a qualified person on that basis'.

12. The date in question for the determination is the date of the  hearing.
    The respondent does not confer rights but declares them. At the hearing
    Mr Deller accepted that the reasons for the challenge  appeared  to  be
    draining away having had sight of the full evidence before the Tribunal
    and that 8 months of payslips  were  a  good  indication  of  continued
    employment.  I agree.

13. As I have pointed out above the judge accepted  that  she  was  working
    albeit that payment was not made into a bank  account  and  there  were
    only two payslips.  The errors made by the judge - in fact  there  were
    payslips on file from the date of appointment  to  the  lodging  of  an
    appeal- only disadvantaged  the  appellant.   The  appellant  may  have
    elected for a paper hearing  and  may  have  been  entitled  to  submit
    further evidence after lodging the appeal but chose not to.  I  do  not
    find that she can be criticised for that or that, because  there  is  a
    gap in the evidence,  it  suggests  she  is  no  longer  working.   She
    submitted evidence as at the date of the appeal.  Further,   that  does
    not mean that  the  appellant's  continuing  employment  could  not  be
    deduced by  the  judge,  from  the  original  Med  Practice  letter  of
    appointment in March 2013 to the  payslips  in  November  and  December
    2013, all  of  which  she  cited,  as  credible  and  accepted  and  as
    continuing.  In the light of the above I find  the  judge  gave,  just,
    adequate reasons.

14. The judge appeared to overlook  all  the  evidence  on  file  and  also
    assumed that all the payslips referred to payment into an account which
    they did not and this may have  been  an  error  but  this  is  to  the
    detriment of the appellant who in fact was successful  in  her  appeal.
    The fact that the payslips confirmed (all bar the latest) that  payment
    was made in cash was also not  something  which  the  judge  seemed  to
    realise.  This was also an error by the judge but this again was to the
    appellant's detriment.  The judge gathered her findings in relation  to
    employment and self employment in one paragraph which made reading more
    difficult and confusing.

15. The errors  identified  had  no  bearing  on  the  other  appeal  being
    considered.   Although there may have been an error in the  explanation
    and the misapprehension of some of the evidence, I find that  there  is
    no error of law in  the  determination  which  could  make  a  material
    difference and the determination of Judge Obhi shall stand.
