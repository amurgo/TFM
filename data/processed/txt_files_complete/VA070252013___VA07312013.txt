Representation:
For the claimants:     Mr G McIndoe, instructed by Latitude Law
For the appellant:     Mr A McVeety Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimants, Daher Midaa, date of birth 9.6.44, and his  wife,  Terez
    Egho, date of birth 1.1.51, are citizens of Syria.

 2. This  is  the  appeal  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  against  the
    determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Mulvenna,  who  allowed  the
    claimants appeals against the decisions of the Entry Clearance Officer,
    dated 23.3.13, to refuse entry  clearance  to  the  United  Kingdom  as
    family visitors pursuant to paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules.  The
    Judge heard the appeal on 31.3.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Ford granted permission to appeal on 21.5.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 17.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. Only the appeals of the first two of  the  four  claimants  are  listed
    before me, Judge Mulvenna having dismissed the appeals of the third and
    fourth appellants who had since sought asylum in Sweden.

 6. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Mulvenna should be set aside.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Ford  found  it  arguable  that
    Judge Mulvenna's findings that the requirements of  paragraph  41  were
    met were contrary to  the  weight  of  the  evidence  and  inadequately
    reasoned. "The appellants originally applied for visit visas with their
    daughter and her husband. The applications of their  daughter  and  her
    husband were also refused and they,  along  with  their  children  then
    travelled to Sweden. They  entered  Sweden  clandestinely  and  claimed
    asylum. The appellant's son has claimed humanitarian protection in  the
    UK. This evidence was before Judge Mulvenna. There is an arguable error
    of law."

 8. The grounds of appeal point out  that  the  judge  made  two  erroneous
    statements at �14 and �27, to  the  effect  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer/ Secretary of State did not challenge the sponsor's evidence as
    to accommodation and maintenance or that the appellants  would  return.
    The refusal decision  and  the  record  of  proceeding  show  that  the
    representative did challenge both issues.  In the circumstances, it may
    be that the First-tier Tribunal Judge has failed to take  into  account
    the challenges to both issues.

 9. Further, it appears to  me  that  the  conclusion  that  the  claimants
    intended to make only a short visit to the UK and then return to  Syria
    flies in the face of the evidence and the judge's findings in  relation
    to the third and fourth claimants, who  were  all  part  of  one  joint
    application for entry as visitors. At �21  the  judge  found  that  the
    family had a subjective fear of persecution in Syria and at �27  stated
    that, "the temptation to infer that the  first  and  second  appellants
    would follow the same course (as the third and fourth appellants) looms
    large." It is difficult to understand how the  judge  could  reach  the
    conclusion on intention justifying allowing the appeal. I find that  it
    was against the weight of the evidence and appears to  have  been  made
    with inadequate reasoning in �28.

10. I am satisfied that there are such errors in the making of the decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal that it should be set aside and remade.

11. In his oral evidence before me, the sponsor explained that his business
    of which he is the sole owner has an income of �140,000 p.a.  Only  he,
    his wife and daughter live in the family home. In the circumstances,  I
    was satisfied on the evidence in relation  to  both  accommodation  and
    maintenance that the two claimants  would  be  able  to  be  adequately
    maintained and accommodated by the sponsor.

12. However, I am not satisfied on the evidence, including  to  the  extent
    that it is relevant the additional evidence submitted on behalf of  the
    claimants, that they intend to leave the  UK  on  conclusion  of  their
    visit and within the time limit of leave. I bear in mind that  as  this
    is an out of country appeal, I have to decide it on the  basis  of  the
    circumstances prevailing at the  date  of  decision  23.3.13.  However,
    subsequent  evidence  may  well  be  relevant  to   understanding   the
    intentions of the claimants as at that date and it is difficult to make
    any real distinction between the present situation and  that  in  March
    2013.

13. Then as now, the situation in Syria is dire. The sponsor told  me  that
    it was not great and not ideal, but he asserted that it was better than
    other parts of Syria. The area of the claimants' residence  is  to  the
    north east of Syria. Recently, the two neighbouring towns  fell  to  IS
    and there are many refugees who fled to safety in the claimants' town.

14. He relied on the fact that they had been to  Lebanon  and  returned  to
    Syria and insisted that they would return to Syria if they came to  the
    UK for a short visit. He would want them to stay  in  the  UK  if  they
    came, but that does not mean they would  stay,  he  said.  However,  it
    appears relevant to me that there would be no desire on the part of the
    sponsor for his parents to leave and return to Syria.

15. I also have to take into account that two of the  four  applicants  for
    the visit visa, on being refused, fled  Syria  for  Sweden  where  they
    claimed asylum.  A  son  of  the  claimants  has  claimed  humanitarian
    protection in the  UK.  The  claimants  may  also  be  aware  that  the
    Secretary of State is not returning people  to  Syria  at  the  present
    time. In his oral evidence, the sponsor said, that his sister's husband
    is a dentist and that they left for Sweden in a hurry, "they felt  they
    had to leave," he said. He confirmed they lived in the same town as his
    parents. He described the situation as "dire," but insisted that it  is
    relatively safe. However,  he  said  that  there  are  kidnappings  for
    ransom, and many people are leaving. Most of the claimants' friends are
    leaving, he said. He also explained that his parents are Christians. It
    thus follows  that  they  would  be  at  particular  risk  from  Muslim
    extremists. Despite that, the sponsor said that they had  got  used  to
    the situation, including the kidnappings, and it  was  "part  of  daily
    life."

16. It would be unfair to refuse all applications from Syria  just  because
    of the situation of unrest. However, the burden is on the claimants  to
    demonstrate on the balance of probabilities  that  this  is  a  genuine
    application for a short family visit and that they intend to leave  the
    UK following their visit and within the period of leave. It is patently
    obvious that there are very strong motivations to leave  the  situation
    of unrest in Syria and that there is a potential risk to the  lives  of
    the claimants. I bear in mind the assertions of the sponsor  that  they
    intend to leave. However, taking the evidence as a whole, including the
    actions of the  other  two  appellants,  and  their  son,  in  claiming
    international protection and having fled Syria, I am far from satisfied
    that these are genuine applications for a short family visit. It  would
    appear that the rest of the immediate family is now outside  Syria  and
    that the children of the claimants would  support  a  decision  not  to
    return to Syria. I do not  accept  their  assertions  that  they  would
    return as credible in the light  of  the  circumstances  prevailing  in
    March 2013, which are little different today. I further find  that  the
    evidence of the sponsor, as set out above, adds greater concern  as  to
    the intentions of the claimants, undermining  the  credibility  of  the
    claim that they will leave the UK. Other members  of  the  family  felt
    that they had to leave and claim asylum in Sweden, even though they had
    applied for a visit to the UK. It is quite clear that  they  had  those
    appellants been able to enter the UK they  would  not  have  left,  but
    claimed asylum.  I  recognise  that  the  circumstances  of  these  two
    claimants is somewhat different, but taking all the  evidence  together
    in the round, I find it impossible to accept that they would leave  the
    UK to return.

17. In all the circumstances and for the reasons set out above, I find that
    the  claimants  have  failed  to  demonstrate   on   the   balance   of
    probabilities that this is a genuine application  for  a  short  family
    visit following which they intend to leave the  UK.  Thus  the  appeals
    must fail as not meeting the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

Conclusion & Decision

18. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision by dismissing the appeal of  each
                    claimant.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals having been dismissed, there can be no fee award.
