Representation:
For the claimant: In person
For the appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Afako promulgated 13.11.14,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal, on human rights grounds and on the  basis  that  the
    decision was not in accordance with the law, against the  decisions  of
    the Secretary of  State  dated  27.9.13  to  refuse  her  10-year  long
    residence application pursuant to paragraph 276B; her British  Overseas
    Citizen (BOC) application; and to remove her from the  UK  pursuant  to
    section 47 of the Immigration Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 14.10.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Holmes  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    9.1.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 16.2.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Afako should be set aside.

 5. Judge Afako concluded that as the claimant did not have existing  leave
    when she left the UK on 8.12.05, her period of residence was broken and
    thus she could not establish continuous  residence  for  the  necessary
    unbroken period, as required under paragraph 276A  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. Whilst the judge omitted to make a  formal  decision  dismissing
    the appeal on this immigration ground, it can be inferred from  �13  of
    the decision. There has  been  no  appeal  against  this  part  of  the
    decision and that claim must stand dismissed.

 6. Peculiarly, Judge Afako proceeded next in the decision to consider  the
    claimant's human rights claim, before  considering  the  BOC  claim  in
    respect of which he reached a decision that the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision in that regard was not in accordance with the law.

 7. As Judge Holmes pointed out in granting permission to  appeal,  if  the
    BOC decision was not in accordance with the law, Judge Afako  erred  in
    law on the basis that the he should have done no more  than  allow  the
    appeal on the limited basis that the decision  was  not  in  accordance
    with  the  law,  so  that  the  application  remained  outstanding.  In
    accordance with Mirza [2011] EWCA Civ 159, there was no need to "travel
    into article 8 once unlawfulness is established, and there are  obvious
    difficulties presuming a removal which, if the  law  is  observed,  may
    never happen." The article 8 claim remains part of the claimant's still
    undetermined case for non-removal.

 8. However, for the reasons set out below, I am  not  satisfied  that  the
    decision to effectively remit the BOC part of the case to the Secretary
    of State was correct  and  find  that  the  decision  was  in  fact  in
    accordance with the law.

 9. Nevertheless, there are a number of flaws in the article  I  also  note
    that at �15 Judge Afako proceeded to consider  the  article  8  private
    life  claim  following  the  Razgar  steps,  but  omitted  to  consider
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules. That invalidates any article
    8 assessment, since it is only necessary to consider the claim  outside
    the Rules if the Rules are not met. As stated in R (Ganesabalan) v SSHD
    [2014] EWHC 2712 (Admin), "The  Immigration  Rules  are  the  important
    first stage and the focus of Article 8 assessments. Indeed it  will  be
    an error of law not to address Article 8 by reference  to  the  Rules,"
    reliance being placed on Halleemudeen v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 558.

10. Further, if the claimant cannot meet paragraph 276ADE, that would be  a
    highly  relevant  factor  to  be  taken  into  consideration   in   the
    proportionality  balancing  exercise,  thus  rendering  the  article  8
    assessment flawed on that ground alone.

11. Further, whilst at �16 the judge 'acknowledged'  section  117B  of  the
    2002 Act to the effect  that  immigration  control  is  in  the  public
    interest, the judge failed to appreciate that this public  interest  is
    to be weighed against the rights of the claimant in the proportionality
    balancing exercise. The judge seems to  have  considered  that  section
    117B only goes to the issue of necessity in the Razgar steps.  That  is
    an error of law which also vitiates the article 8 ECHR assessment.

12. The grounds of application for permission to appeal also point out that
    in assessing the article 8 claim at �23 the judge took into account the
    immaterial matter that if the claimant  had  made  representations  the
    Secretary of State might have exercised her discretion. I agree that if
    it was taken into consideration, it was irrelevant  to  the  article  8
    assessment. Similarly, there are other irrelevant  findings  apparently
    taken into account in the article 8 assessment, such as the finding  at
    �44 that the claimant is the descendant of a British Overseas  Citizen.
    Given that this issue was effectively  remitted  to  the  Secretary  of
    State it was not capable of informing the article 8 assessment.

13. In the circumstances, whether or the BOC  decision  was  in  accordance
    with the law, the article 8 ECHR assessment is flawed and cannot stand.



14. In relation to the  BOC  claim,  notwithstanding  that  at  �44  it  is
    recorded that Mr Staunton, the representative of the Secretary of State
    at the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing, indicated that if the  judge
    found the claimant's  father  to  be  a  BOC,  the  decision  would  be
    reviewed, the Secretary of State has sought to appeal the BOC  part  of
    the First-tier Tribunal decision. At paragraph 13 of the grounds it  is
    submitted that the judge in error failed to note that pursuant  to  IDI
    Aug/01 a British Overseas  Citizen  would  be  required  to  present  a
    passport confirming the status, in order to  qualify  for  a  grant  of
    indefinite leave to enter the UK.

15. It could have been  better  pleaded  in  the  grounds,  but  Mr  Jarvis
    produced a skeleton argument points out that the IDI policy referred to
    by the Judge was abolished with effect from 5.3.02, as the judge  noted
    at �38. Although she had been in the UK  between  1978  and  1987,  the
    claimant returned to the UK on 16.9.02 (with leave as  a  student)  and
    thus there was no extant policy that she could have taken advantage  of
    in 2002, as the judge found at �40, quite apart from the fact that  she
    left the UK and last returned in May 2006, by which time the policy had
    long since elapsed.

16. It is not clear that the judge reached any conclusion on the discussion
    in the decision as to whether the claimant could  rely  on  a  previous
    presence in the UK between 1978 and 1987. The judge postulated a number
    of "ifs," such as at �42, but made no actual finding. At �43, the judge
    stated "this is therefore a case where the respondent needs to consider
    the appellant as a BOC who had a work  permit  in  the  United  Kingdom
    prior to 5 March 2002... There may well be other  implications  arising
    from the fact that her father was a BOC; I have  dealt  only  with  the
    matters raised during the appeal." With respect to the judge, a finding
    that the decision of the Secretary of State was not in accordance  with
    the law requires a definite foundation for such a  conclusion.  It  was
    for the claimant to establish her case and the judge does not  identify
    what provision, either of statute or policy, that has been breached. An
    assurance that the case  would  be  reviewed  or  looked  at  again  is
    insufficient to found  a  conclusion  that  the  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law. The judge has to identify  a  specific  policy
    which was in force at the date of decision or which governed  her  case
    when considered at the date of decision. Even when it was in force  the
    policy concession required the claimant to both be a BOC and to present
    a work permit on entry. As the claimant never had a  BOC  passport  she
    would not have been able to demonstrate that she  was  a  BOC  and  she
    never presented a work permit as a BOC.

17. In the circumstances, the finding that the decision of the Secretary of
    State was not in accordance with the law is flawed for  lack  of  legal
    foundation and cannot stand. Further, there is no  purpose  in  sending
    the decision back to the Secretary of State when  the  outcome  of  the
    issue is inevitably going to be resolved against the claimant.

18. Having set the decision aside, I  proceeded  to  remake  the  decision,
    finding for the same reasons as given by the First-tier  Tribunal  that
    the long-residence claim must be dismissed. I also find no error of law
    in the BOC decision of the Secretary of State.

19. That leaves only the claimant's article 8 private life claim. She  told
    me she has a niece in the UK, who is married, but no closer family. She
    does not have a partner or child in the UK. In the  circumstances,  the
    claimant cannot meet the requirements of Appendix FM.

20. In relation to private life and paragraph 276ADE, the claimant has  not
    been in the UK 20 years. Given that, for the reasons set out herein,  I
    am dismissing the appeal on all grounds, she cannot  reach  a  10  year
    long-residence claim as the conclusion of the  appeal  will  break  her
    continuous lawful leave long before she reaches the 10 years in 2016.

21. The claimant told me about her long residence in the UK from May  2006.
    She is employed as a staff nurse and  is  financially  self-sufficient.
    She has developed a wide range of friendships and associations  through
    her life in the UK, particularly work colleagues, and is  used  to  the
    way of life in the UK. However, she is too busy to be involved  in  any
    community activities or charity work. I take into account  the  history
    set out at �6 of the First-tier  Tribunal  decision,  as  well  as  the
    considerations at �18, together with  those  matters  set  out  in  her
    witness statement. I  also  bear  in  mind  that  pursuant  to  section
    117B(1), immigration control is in the public interest.

22. The claimant is a US citizen, where she has two siblings  and  in  fact
    still owns a home. She has lived in the UK for a significant period and
    is qualified to  work  there  as  a  nurse.  She  does  not  anticipate
    difficulty  in  obtaining  further  employment  in  the  USA.  In   the
    circumstances, with all due respect to her desire to remain in the  UK,
    there is nothing compelling about her personal circumstances here.  She
    was unable to point me to any significant  obstacles  to  reintegration
    into the USA. In fact, she mainly  pleaded  for  time  to  be  able  to
    arrange her departure if she had to leave. As she  has  had  her  leave
    extended since 2012 because of the length appeal process, she may  well
    be in a good position to seek further leave to remain on the same  Tier
    1 basis, but that is a matter for her  to  consider  and  the  Tribunal
    cannot advise in respect of the same. This long appeal process has been
    unfortunate, but is no fault of the Secretary of State or the Tribunal.

23. In the  circumstances,  I  find  that  the  claimant  cannot  meet  the
    requirements of 276ADE for leave to remain  on  the  basis  of  private
    life. Even if I went on to consider article 8 ECHR outside  the  Rules,
    the very same considerations would come into play and I would  have  to
    reach the conclusion that the decision is entirely proportionate to the
    claimant's private life rights and does not produce a result  which  is
    unjustifiably harsh (Nagre). Following the latest authority of Singh  v
    SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74, it is not  in  fact  necessary  to  go  on  to
    consider  article  8  where  it  is  clear  that   all   private   life
    considerations have  been  addressed  in  the  276ADE  claim,  which  I
    conclude has been done.

24. In the circumstances, the claimant's appeal must fail on all grounds.

Conclusion & Decision:

25. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                       I re-make the decision in the appeal by:

      a) Dismissing the long-residence claim pursuant to paragraph 276AB  of
         the Immigration Rules;

      b) Dismissing the BOC claim;

      c) Dismissing the appeal on human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the BOC claim remains to be decided.
