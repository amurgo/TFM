                            DECISION AND REASONS

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to Rule 13  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules
2014.  I continue that order pursuant to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008: unless the Upper Tribunal or  a  court  directs
otherwise, no report  of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of  publication
thereof  shall  identify  the  original  appellant,  whether   directly   or
indirectly.  This order  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all  parties.   Any
failure to comply with this order could  give  rise  to  contempt  of  court
proceedings.

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Hanes who  on  16th  February  2018  dismissed  his
    appeal under the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds,  making
    an anonymity direction.   The appellant is a Nigerian citizen.

Background

 2. The appellant's account of his history, and that given by his wife, are
    not disputed.  Mr McVeety did not seek to cross-examine either of them.



 3. The appellant came to the United Kingdom  in  2002  as  a  19-year  old
    student and studied here, with leave, until June 2008.  He played rugby
    for his university and was a member of the student union executive  and
    the NUS committee.  He joined Hackney Rugby Club after  university  and
    trained as an officer cadet with the British  Army.   On  16  September
    2004, the appellant  was  convicted  of  common  assault  following  an
    altercation after a football (presumably rugby football) match  and  of
    using a used or  partly  used  ticket  on  the  railways.   He  has  no
    subsequent convictions.

 4. After university, the appellant worked as a financial  analyst  and  in
    investment banking,  achieving  the  Professional  Certificate  of  the
    Chartered Institute for Securities and Investment in 2011, and  working
    for Goldman Sachs for 9 months in 2015, as well as for  Lloyds  Banking
    Group, Barclays Investment Bank and Citibank NA, all in London.

 5. From May 2011 - May 2016, the appellant benefited from an EEA residence
    card based on his relationship with an EEA national,  Ms  Hauge,  which
    continued until 1 April 2015, when she was redeployed by  her  employer
    to a position in Norway, and he did not accompany her.  The appellant's
    EEA residence card granted in May 2011 was due to expire in  May  2016,
    but the circumstances of which it was evidence had ceased to exist.

 6. Immediately after his former partner left to go to Norway, on or  about
    2 April 2015 the appellant made an application for leave to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom outside the Rules on human rights  grounds  (private
    life only at that stage).  He did not disclose his conviction in  2004.
    In her refusal letter on 18 June 2015, the  respondent  had  regard  to
    that omission, and the conviction, on character grounds.  The appellant
    could not bring himself within  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules with regard to paragraph 276ADE, R-LTRP1.1 and D-LTRP.1.3 and the
    respondent was not made aware of any relationship with a partner in the
    United Kingdom or any other exceptional circumstances.  The  respondent
    did not consider that there would be any significant obstacles  to  his
    integration in Nigeria, where he had lived for the first  19  years  of
    his life (he is 35 now).

 7. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

 8. In June 2015, around the date of  the  refusal  letter,  the  appellant
    began a relationship with [VK], a British citizen of  Polish  heritage,
    whom he had known since 2012 as a friend, and  has  now  married.   His
    wife is a child  psychotherapist,  earning  ï¿½34000  per  annum  and  is
    studying for a PhD in Psychology at the University of Leicester.   They
    have supported each other  through  serious  personal  stresses  during
    their relationship.  They have also enjoyed outings together, holidays,
    and taken up hobbies (walking in the  countryside,  exploring  National
    Heritage sites and fencing). They have an  active  social  life  and  a
    large circle of mutual friends.  They  have  been  trying  to  start  a
    family but unfortunately the sponsor miscarried their first child.

 9. While he has been in the United Kingdom, the  appellant's  two  younger
    brothers (both living in Turkey), his aunts, his uncles  and  both  his
    grandparents have died. The appellant's parents still live in  Nigeria,
    though they spend most of their time with  his  surviving  siblings  in
    Turkey. The appellant remains liable  for  National  Youth  Service  in
    Nigeria (one year) which he would have  to  complete  before  he  could
    begin to work there.

10. In December  2016,  the  couple  notified  the  Home  Office  of  their
    intention to marry and on 16 August  2017,  they  attended  a  marriage
    interview at Lewisham Registry Office.  Following approval by the local
    Council and the Home Office, they married on 30 January 2018 and  on  4
    September 2018, they purchased a property together as their matrimonial
    home.   The appellant intends to continue to support himself and not to
    depend on public funds. They still do not have children: although  they
    continue to try, they  have  now  had  the  misfortune  to  suffer  two
    miscarriages.

Procedural history

11. First-tier Judge Colvin dismissed the appellant's  appeal  against  the
    refusal of leave to remain on family and private life grounds,  holding
    that the appellant's marriage was a new matter on which he did not have
    jurisdiction.   The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal  and  DUTJ
    Norton-Taylor remitted the appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal,  on  the
    basis that the relationship between the appellant and his wife was not,
    properly understood, a new matter. The  respondent  did  not  challenge
    that decision.

12. On remittal, First-tier Judge Hanes dismissed the appeal again, on  the
    basis that the marriage was a 'new matter', without, it appears, having
    canvassed that question with the parties at the hearing.  The appellant
    appealed to the Upper Tribunal again and the appeal came before  me  in
    July 2018.

13. At that hearing, pursuant to Section 85(5), the Home Office  Presenting
    Officer (Mr Paul Duffy) indicated that the respondent consented to  the
    new matter being dealt with in these  proceedings.   That  consent  was
    recorded in writing in a letter received by the Upper Tribunal the same
    day:

         "With regard to the Upper Tribunal hearing this afternoon: this  is
         to confirm that pursuant  to  section  85(5)  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, as amended by the Immigration  Act
         2014, the Secretary of State gives his consent to the  Tribunal  to
         consider the 'new matter' of the appellant's new relationship  (now
         marriage) raised before the First-tier Tribunal."

14. By a decision served on 9 August 2018, I set aside the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal as it related to the new matter of the  family  and
    private life between the appellant and his wife, to be remade,  limited
    to the new matter, in the Upper Tribunal on a date to be fixed.

15. I gave the following directions for the future conduct of this appeal:-

        1) Witness statements limited to the new matter  issue  are  to  be
           served and filed within three weeks from the sending out of this
           decision.

        2) The Secretary of State shall  indicate  in  writing  within  two
           weeks thereafter whether he wishes to cross-examine on  any  and
           if so on which of the witness statements served upon him and  if
           he does not wish to cross-examine the matter  shall  proceed  on
           submissions alone.

        3) If the appeal should proceed to a further hearing no additional
           documents other than the witness statements are to be served
           without the leave of the Tribunal and each party may file a
           skeleton argument if so advised, to be limited to four A4 pages.



    The witness statements were served but the Secretary of State  did  not
    indicate within the time limited whether he wished to cross-examine the
    parties.

16. The appellant did not comply with the 'no additional  documents'  order
    and filed a bundle of 35 documents on 22  October  2018,  just  a  week
    before the hearing.  There was no application to the Upper Tribunal  to
    admit these documents but Mr McVeety, who appears for  the  respondent,
    did not object to my considering them and I have done so.

17. At the hearing today, Mr McVeety indicated that  he  did  not  wish  to
    cross-examine.  The evidence of the appellant and  his  wife  therefore
    stands unchallenged. Mr McVeety indicated that he did not feel able  to
    concede  the  appeal,  but  that  the  respondent's  challenge  to  the
    genuineness of the marriage and that the  relationship  was  subsisting
    was no longer maintained.

18. I reserved my decision, which I now give.

Analysis

19. The appellant has lived in the United Kingdom for 16 years.  He  cannot
    therefore bring himself within paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Rules.   His
    private life must be given little  weight  since  it  has  always  been
    precarious or unlawful.

20. However, the appellant also has family  life  with  his  wife  and  his
    friendship with her was established in 2009 when  he  did  have  leave.
    His relationship with her as a partner was established  in  2015,  when
    the appellant still had the benefit of an EEA residence card  and  had,
    properly, notified the respondent of his change  of  circumstances  and
    made a prompt application for leave to remain on human  rights  grounds
    outside the Rules.  On that basis,  the  little  weight  provisions  of
    section 117B(4)(b) do not bite as  the  appellant  was  in  the  United
    Kingdom lawfully when he entered into this relationship.

21. I take into account that, apart  from  the  appellant's  conviction  in
    2004, there is nothing in the facts of this appeal which indicates that
    were the appellant  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom  and  apply  to  be
    readmitted as his wife's spouse, that  application  would  be  refused.
    Both of them are professionals earning good  salaries  and  his  wife's
    salary comfortably exceeds the ï¿½18600 minimum for a spouse application.
     Mr  McVeety  having  withdrawn  the  respondent's  objection  to  this
    application, I approach it on the basis that the 2004  conviction,  now
    some 14 years ago,  would  not  result  in  the  respondent  exercising
    discretion against him if he were to make an out of country application
    for permission to appeal as his wife's spouse.

22. I have regard to the line of decisions flowing from the decision of the
    House of Lords in Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40.  I am satisfied that
    this is a Chikwamba type of case and given the lack of opposition  from
    the respondent, that it is appropriate to allow the appeal outside  the
    Rules.
