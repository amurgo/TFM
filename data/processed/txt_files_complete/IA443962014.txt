For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Jamaica whose date of birth  is  recorded
    as 27 January 1973.  He arrived illegally  in  the  United  Kingdom  at
    sometime in 1999 and on 20 September 2002 was  encountered  and  served
    with  a  Form  IS151A  notifying  him  of  his  liability  to  removal.
    Thereafter he was convicted of a number of offences including  offences
    of dishonesty until on 5 March 2010 he was  detained  pending  removal.
    On 3 June 2010 however, he was released but was soon committing further
    offences of dishonesty until on 9 November 2011 he was  again  detained
    for removal.  On 13 December 2011 he applied for Judicial  Review.   On
    24 January 2012 he was released from detention pending  a  decision  on
    the application which was refused on  the  papers  on  19  March  2012.
    Thereafter  the  Appellant  was  given  28  days  to  produce   further
    submissions to support his request to remain in the United Kingdom  but
    he did not do so.

 2. On 5 September 2012 the Appellant married SW.

 3. On 23 September 2014 the Secretary of  State  wrote  to  the  Appellant
    requesting  up-to-date   information   regarding   his   then   current
    circumstances.  The  questions  asked  in  that  letter  were  directed
    towards any relationships which the Appellant might  have  formed,  any
    children, any employment and/or any relevant medical conditions.  On 12
    October 2014 the Appellant's solicitors wrote to the Secretary of State
    in response to the letter of 23 September 2014 explaining the  marriage
    and nature of the relationship. Importantly the letter makes  reference
    to his wife getting panic attacks and as such he was  involved  in  her
    life not only as  her  husband  but  as  her  carer.   The  letter  was
    accompanied by medical evidence, a  marriage  certificate  and  certain
    other documents all dated in 2014.  Paragraph 6 of  the  letter  of  12
    October 2014 reads as follows:-

         "The main reasons why our client wishes to  remain  in  the  United
         Kingdom at this stage, includes the fact that he is  married  to  a
         British citizen,  and  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  which
         prevents him from leaving her and returning to Jamaica. He  is  her
         carer as she has serious medical concerns.  He says that he has  to
         wake up at 5.00a.m. every morning to make sure that his wife  takes
         her tablets, and ensure that she does not go  into  panic  attacks.
         He has been recognised by the medical consultants as her carer  and
         any attempt to leave her at this time can  be  detrimental  to  her
         health condition.  He also arrived in the United Kingdom in October
         1991, fifteen years ago and has his family members  in  the  United
         Kingdom, with no life or no one else to go to in Jamaica.   He  has
         never been married to  anyone  else  before  and  has  no  children
         anywhere else.  He has continued to sign on at Beckett House  since
         2003 (fourteen years ago) to date, and confirms that he is the main
         carer for his home."

 4. On 6 November 2014 the Secretary of State responded with a decision  to
    remove the Appellant as an illegal entrant with his human rights  claim
    being refused.  The accompanying letter set  out  the  convictions  and
    explained that in the view of the Secretary of  State  the  Appellant's
    presence in the United Kingdom, given the offending, was not  conducive
    to the public good.  Reference was made to Appendix FM, S-LTR 1.5.

         "S-LTR.1.1. The applicant will be refused limited leave on grounds
         of suitability in any of paragraphs S-LTR.1.2. to 1.7. apply....

         S-LTR.1.5. The presence of the applicant in the UK is not conducive
         to the public good because, in the view of the Secretary of State,
         their offending has caused serious harm or they are a persistent
         offender who shows a particular disregard for the law."

    It was noted  that  between  2003  and  2011  the  Appellant  had  been
    convicted on ten separate  occasions  for  various  offences  including
    driving offences, drug offences and theft.  I note that  the  Appellant
    received  various  disposals  including  fines,  a   suspended   prison
    sentence,  and  community  orders,  one  of  which  he  breached.   The
    Secretary of  State  therefore  contended  that  the  Appellant  was  a
    "persistent offender"

 5. Further, the Secretary of State did not accept that the Appellant  was,
    at the time of the decision, in a relationship or that there  had  been
    cohabitation in the previous two years or since the date  of  marriage;
    indeed the marriage itself was not accepted.  The  Secretary  of  State
    did not therefore accept that the eligibility requirements were met.

 6. In the alternative the Secretary of State  gave  consideration  to  the
    exceptions to certain of the  eligibility  requirements  for  leave  to
    remain as a partner and having regard to Appendix FM-EX.1(b) it was not
    accepted that  there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    continuing outside the United Kingdom.  The Secretary of State  focused
    on the medical conditions set out in the supporting evidence but was of
    the view that there  was  sufficient  availability  of  the  medication
    required by the Appellant's wife in Jamaica.

 7. As to private life, regard was had to paragraph 276ADE as to which  the
    Secretary of State again contended that  the  suitability  requirements
    were not met.  Though the Appellant had claimed to be in employment  he
    had worked when he had no permission to do so but the fact that he  had
    demonstrated an ability to work would mean, in the  contention  of  the
    Secretary of State, that he could employ those skills in Jamaica.   The
    Appellant was noted to have said that his father was  ill  and  in  the
    United Kingdom  but  there  was  said  to  be  no  sufficient  evidence
    concerning that.   There  was  therefore,  in  the  submission  of  the
    Secretary of State, no very significant obstacles  to  his  integration
    into his home country so that the requirements of 276ADE(iii)-(vi) were
    not met.  The letter did not go on to consider the wider application of
    Article 8 ECHR; it was not felt necessary to do so.

 8. Not content with that decision, the Appellant appealed  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  On 23 April 2015 his appeal was heard by Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal  Monson.   There  was  a  preliminary  issue.   The
    Appellant at that time was represented  by  Mr  Amgbah.   Although  the
    appeal was listed in the float list, on arriving at the hearing centre,
    Mr Amgbah, made written representations for the  appeal  to  be  placed
    first in the list because of SW's panic attacks  which,  it  was  said,
    would be exacerbated by any long period of waiting.  The matter was not
    placed before Judge Monson until the middle of the morning.

 9. Though SW was present in the hearing centre she was not, in Mr Amgbah's
    submission, mentally or physically able  to  give  evidence  that  day.
    Judge Monson stood the matter down in order  to  consider  the  medical
    evidence available to him but having come to the view  that  there  was
    not sufficient evidence that SW was unfit to give evidence and with  Mr
    Amgbah not in a position to give Judge Monson any reassurance  that  SW
    would be better  able  to  give  evidence  on  a  future  occasion  the
    adjournment request was refused.  In his Statement  of  Reasons,  Judge
    Monson stated:

         "If SW regarded giving evidence in support of her husband's  appeal
         as a form of mental torture, it was better for her to get  it  over
         and done with today, rather than to seek to put if off.  It was not
         going to get any easier for her, and in any event it was not  shown
         by appropriate medical evidence that she  was  not  unfit  to  give
         evidence."

10. The matter proceeded without SW giving evidence.   In  making  findings
    Judge Monson noted various  inconsistencies  in  the  evidence,  making
    reference in particular at paragraph 30 to the letter of Dr Braithwaite
    of 10 February 2015 being silent as to panic attacks or  mental  health
    problems.  Judge Monson clearly gave significant weight to the  failure
    of SW to give evidence. He expressed himself as follows:-

         "... her palpable reluctance to give evidence on his  behalf,  even
         though she was in attendance, is highly damaging to the credibility
         of the  claim  that  the  marriage  between  them  is  genuine  and
         subsisting."

11. Recognising that the burden of proof was upon the  Appellant  to  prove
    his case to the civil standard, Judge Monson dismissed  the  appeal  on
    all grounds having regard to Appendix FM, Rule 276ADE and on the  wider
    application of Article 8 ECHR, including consideration of those matters
    set out in Section 117B of the 2002 Act.

12. On or about 19 May 2015 the Appellant made application  for  permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  It was submitted  that  Judge  Monson
    erred in four respects

      1) Failing to grant an adjournment.

      2) Focusing on the past relationship of the Appellant when the  proper
         question, it was submitted, was whether the  marriage  was  genuine
         and subsisting  at  the  date  of  the  application,  decision  and
         hearing.

      3) Misinterpreting the information given in the medical report leading
         to unsustainable findings.

      4) Failing to consider the insurmountable obstacles  relevant  to  the
         appeal  having  found  that  the  marriage  was  not   genuine   or
         subsisting.

13. On 20 July 2015 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal M  Davis  refused  the
    application.

14. On 4 August 2015 the Appellant made a renewed application to the  Upper
    Tribunal on the same grounds and on 4  September  2015  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Gill granted permission. In doing so she stated  her  reasons  as
    follows:

         "I am not entirely sure that the file contains the medical evidence
         that was before Judge Monson on the hearing day.  I have  therefore
         relied upon what the grounds state about the medical evidence  that
         was before him.

         Given that I am only considering whether to  grant  permission  and
         given what the grounds state about the medical evidence, it  is  at
         least arguable that the judge should have adjourned the hearing and
         that his refusal to do so arguably means  that  the  Appellant  has
         been deprived of the opportunity  of  having  his  wife  give  oral
         evidence. Again, relying  on  what  the  grounds  state  about  the
         medical evidence, it is arguable that it was  unrealistic  for  the
         judge to expect to see medical evidence to the effect that she  was
         unfit to give evidence on the particular day.

         The parties will be  expected  to  state  clearly  at  the  hearing
         precisely what medical evidence was before the judge.  In addition,
         the Appellant should note that, whilst I have considered  that  the
         threshold of arguability has (just about) been reached, it does not
         follow that the Upper Tribunal will conclude that  the  refusal  of
         the adjournment request did lead to unfairness.  In  this  respect,
         the Appellant will be well  advised  to  ensure  that  he  produces
         medical evidence confirming in clear terms the medical condition of
         the Appellant's wife at the date of the hearing before  the  judge.
         The medical evidence should also confirm that she did suffer from a
         panic attack on the  hearing  day  (23  April  2015)  and  received
         treatment for it, how the panic attack affected her and whether the
         doctor is of the view that she was fit to  give  evidence  on  that
         day; alternatively, that she was prone to suffer from sudden  panic
         attacks at the relevant time (on or about 23 April 2015), how  such
         panic attacks affected her at the relevant time  (on  or  about  23
         April 2015); and in either  case,  whether,  if  there  is  another
         hearing, she would be fit to give evidence.

         The question whether any such evidence  is  admissible  will  be  a
         matter for the judge who hears this appeal.

         The remaining grounds may also be argued."

    Thus the matter comes before me.

Was there an error of law?

15. Quite properly given  what  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Gill  had  said  in
    granting permission, Ms Everett did not object  to  Mr  Parkin  placing
    before me a letter written by Dr Farley, dated  6  November  2015.   Dr
    Farley is a general practitioner involved in  SW's  care.   The  letter
    states that SW was diagnosed with  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  in
    2012 consequent upon domestic violence and an attempted sexual  assault
    in 2009.  Her condition worsened after suffering a cardiac  arrest  due
    to myocardial infarction in 2014.  The medical records  going  back  to
    2013 make reference to panic attacks, often precipitated by leaving the
    house and so she avoids  going  out  because  of  these  attacks.   The
    records refer to a panic attack in  April  2015  at  the  time  of  the
    relevant hearing and in  consequence  the  Appellant  was  referred  to
    psychology service for further support.  SW is waiting for that further
    treatment.  In the opinion of Dr Farley SW  may  find  giving  evidence
    difficult because of her anxiety and  panic  attacks  and  invites  the
    reader to take all of those matters into consideration.

16. The grounds of appeal make the point that the judge  erred  in  stating
    that the medical evidence had not  made  reference  to  panic  attacks.
    Reference was made to the refusal letter at paragraph 35 which in  turn
    made reference to the medical letter of 10 October 2014,  submitted  in
    support of the Appellant's application to remain in the United Kingdom,
    with reference made to depression and psychosis.

17. I have seen the letter of 10 October 2014 which simply summarises  SW's
    medical  history.   There  is  however  reference   to   some   clearly
    significant events including  a  serious  sexual  assault,  history  of
    domestic violence and consequent post-traumatic stress disorder. Whilst
    the letter of 10 October 2014 does not  expressly  state  that  SW  was
    suffering from panic attacks or mental health problems,  post-traumatic
    stress disorder is clearly a mental health problem and may or  may  not
    include panic attacks.   There  was  at  least  corroborative  evidence
    before the judge of that which was being asserted  by  the  Appellant's
    representative.

18. Although the Appellant relies on grounds  other  than  the  failure  to
    grant the adjournment, I indicated to the parties that  my  preliminary
    view was that there had been unfairness in the First-tier  Tribunal  by
    the refusal of the adjournment:

         "...the test to be applied to a  decision  on  the  adjournment  of
         proceedings is not whether it lay within the broad band of judicial
         discretion but whether, in the judgment of the Appellant court,  it
         was unfair": Terluck v Berezovsky [2010] EWCA Civ 1345.

    The evidence of SW was  highly  relevant.   The  importance  of  it  is
    demonstrated by the adverse inferences drawn by  Judge  Monson  to  the
    absence of it.

19. Fairly and wisely, though Ms Everett did not concede the error of  law,
    she did not press, without more, for the decision to stand.

20. I agree with the Appellant's submission, made in the grounds, that  the
    representative could not have anticipated, on that  very  day,  at  the
    time of the hearing, SW, would  suffer  from  a  panic  attack.   Still
    further the opinion expressed by Judge Monson that it would  be  better
    for SW "to get matters over and done with on that day rather than  seek
    to put it off",  was  not  a  matter  upon  which  Judge  Monson  might
    reasonably have been expected to  express  an  opinion,  absent  expert
    evidence.  He could not know whether the situation would get easier for
    her or not.  At the very least, given that the test is one of fairness,
    Judge Monson should have granted the Appellant  the  adjournment  asked
    for, with a direction for the  type  of  evidence  suggested  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Gill, in order that the First-tier Tribunal might decide
    on the next occasion how to treat the evidence of SW were she not  able
    to attend or, if she were able to attend, whether, and to  what  extent
    she should be treated as a vulnerable witness.

21. As it was SW attended before me.  At the outset, I asked  her  how  she
    was feeling and whether she  felt  able  to  give  evidence.   She  was
    clearly nervous but nevertheless said that were matters to proceed, she
    did feel able to give evidence. Clearly that went to the materiality of
    any error in not granting the adjournment.

22. Though I only gave an indication that I was of the view that the  judge
    had erred in law, for the reasons that I have already given, I do  find
    that the judge  unintentionally  acted  unfairly  in  not  granting  an
    adjournment and that such had a material affect upon the outcome of the
    hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.

23. The remaining grounds go to the issue  credibility  and  since  I  have
    found a material error of law I set aside the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, which I am able to remake.

The remaking of the decision

24. There was some discussion as to whether the Appellant  needed  to  give
    evidence afresh, or at least make himself available for further  cross-
    examination, but Ms Everett was content to note that there was a record
    of the evidence given by him in  the  Statement  of  Reasons  of  Judge
    Monson so that in the circumstances it would be necessary only  for  SW
    to give evidence, though were some fresh matter to arise in the  course
    of the questions put to her, Ms Everett would invite  the  Tribunal  to
    have  the  Appellant  recalled.   Further  the  parties  were  content,
    notwithstanding the fact that this was KJ's appeal, for KJ to leave the
    hearing room whilst SW's evidence was given.  Given that KJ was at  all
    material times represented in the hearing room, I was content for  that
    procedure to be adopted.

25. KJ's evidence is set out  in  his  witness  statement  as  recorded  at
    paragraphs 17-24 of the decision of Judge Monson as set out below:

         "17. Mr Amgbah called the Appellant as a witness, and he adopted as
             his evidence in chief his witness statement in the Appellant's
             bundle.  It was not true that he entered  the  United  Kingdom
             illegally.  On arrival at Heathrow airport, he was given a six
             month holiday visa.  Unfortunately he lost his passport and he
             had reported the  loss  of  his  passport  to  the  UK  police
             sometime in 2000.

         18.  Before coming to  the  United  Kingdom,  he  did  not  have  a
             criminal record.  He was living with a girlfriend in  Jamaica,
             and worked for Sandals Resort as a table  server.   It  was  a
             good job.  His reason for coming to the United Kingdom was  to
             see his father, because he had not seen him for more than  ten
             years.  He did not go back after his visit, because  after  he
             came here his mother called him to say that his girlfriend had
             begun to see a corrupt police officer so if  he  returned,  he
             might not be safe so he decided to stay a little bit,  and  to
             return to Jamaica only when he felt [safe] to do so.

         19.  He had met his future wife sometime in  2008  at  a  party  in
             Brixton.  They had begun a serious relationship in  June  2010
             and had married on 5 September 2012.  He had not been involved
             in any criminal offences since  his  marriage.   He  had  been
             gainfully employed with Vinchi Construction in Battersea as  a
             fire marshall/traffic marshall.  He had  provided  details  of
             this employment to the  Home  Office,  to  whom  he  had  been
             reporting since 2002.  He had passed his exams for crane work,
             and he was looking  forward  to  becoming  a  safety  officer.
             Previously he worked as a  construction  worker,  and  he  had
             started working with Vinchi Construction as a fire and traffic
             marshall in February 2014.  It  was  through  this  employment
             that he was able to maintain himself and his wife.

         20.  His wife is a British  national,  who  had  been  born  on  21
             October 1965. Her parents and siblings all lived in the United
             Kingdom.  She did not have a  British  passport,  as  she  had
             never travelled out of the United Kingdom and so she  had  not
             needed one.  He could confirm that she was a  British  citizen
             by birth...

         23.  In cross-examination, Ms Savage asked the Appellant why  there
             were only documents from 2014 evidencing  co-habitation,  when
             he claimed that they had started living together in 2008,  and
             been living together for four years before they  got  married.
             He said that the Home Office had always known where he was, as
             he had been reporting since the year 2000.  He and his  spouse
             had always lived at the same address, namely the [  -  ]  Road
             address in London [ - ],  in  respect  of  which  there  is  a
             tenancy agreement in the  name  of  [SW]  in  the  Appellant's
             bundle.  The tenancy agreement with Camden Council is dated  1
             October 2007.

         24.  The Appellant was asked why the council tax bill  rendered  on
             17 March 2014 to [SW] credited  her  with  a  single  person's
             discount.  The Appellant answered  that  there  was  no  point
             telling the council about him as he had "no stay" but he  said
             the council knew now that he was sharing the occupancy of  the
             flat with [SW]."

26. I set out the  evidence  of  the  Appellant  because  in  remaking  the
    decision I remind myself that I have to have regard to the totality  of
    the evidence recognising that it is still for the  Appellant  to  prove
    his case applying the civil standard.

27. SW adopted her witness  statement  of  20  April  2015.   Her  evidence
    follows. She was born in the United  Kingdom  of  British  parents  and
    produced a birth certificate.  She does not have a passport because she
    suffers from panic attacks and cannot fly.   She  has  never  left  the
    United Kingdom and therefore has never needed a passport.   Indeed  she
    has never applied for one.  She met the Appellant at a party in Brixton
    in 2008.  Sometime in 2010 their relationship began  and  they  started
    living together in 2011.  Since they have lived together, it has always
    been at the same address on [ - ] Road.  They married  on  5  September
    2012 and she confirms that the relationship is genuine and  subsisting.
    It would not be possible for her to go  to  Jamaica  with  her  husband
    given her medical conditions and in addition her children, parents  and
    siblings all live in the United Kingdom and she would not  wish  to  be
    separated from them.  She is concerned that she would not  be  able  to
    access medical treatment in Jamaica.  She does not want  the  Appellant
    to be returned to Jamaica.  Without him she does not know how she would
    cope; he has provided for the family financially.   Since  meeting  the
    Appellant her life has been more stable.

28. SW was cross-examined and taken to the letter of 12 December 2014  from
    the Joint, Head and Neck Clinic written to SW's  general  practitioner.
    The letter is dated 26 November 2014 (a second page was missing).  That
    letter whilst  making  reference  to  SW's  medical  condition  states,
    amongst other things:

         "She lives alone and is independent."

29. SW said that she did not know how that appeared in the letter since she
    had never been asked about it.  She said that  she  and  the  Appellant
    started living together in 2010 and it was  then,  when  the  Appellant
    "moved in", that they started a proper relationship.

30. Asked why there were no documents prior to 2014, she  said  that  given
    his status the Appellant's name wasn't on anything, including the  rent
    book.  So far as obtaining a discount for being single with respect  to
    council tax, she said that that was the, "the last thing on  my  mind."
    She confirmed that  her  eldest  child,  29  years  of  age,  knew  the
    Appellant.  I was told that they had met a couple of times  though  the
    daughter was not at their wedding as  SW  and  her  daughter  were  not
    talking at that time.  SW did say that it had occurred to her  and  the
    Appellant that  her  mother  might  give  evidence  but  she  had  just
    undergone a mastectomy. At that point SW broke down in tears but  after
    being reassured, continued to give evidence, telling me that her mother
    had made a good recovery and was now out of hospital.

31. When asked if she and the Appellant had any friends in common, she said
    that they would hardly go out but she did say that it had not  occurred
    to her to think of asking any friends to give evidence.

32. Turning to how life would be in  Jamaica,  SW  said  that  it  was  the
    Appellant who made sure that she took her medication.   She  said  that
    she was sometimes agoraphobic.  She did not know his immigration status
    when first they met but she said she managed to work it out because  he
    "kept going missing on a Thursday."

33. So far as the lack of  documents  prior  to  2014  were  concerned,  SW
    explained that after she  had  had  her  heart  attack,  the  Appellant
    telephoned the council and said that, "it was fair to say that prior to
    that he had not been open about living at the address". There was no re-
    examination.

34. It was common ground that the requirements for leave  to  remain  as  a
    partner required consideration of the suitability requirements  because
    the Appellant had overstayed the period  of  more  than  28  days.   Mr
    Parkin sought to persuade  me  that  the  suitability  requirement  was
    discretionary rather than mandatory and that the  record  of  offending
    was not serious.  There had not been any immediate  custodial  sentence
    and the offending was not of a level  that  would  trigger  refusal  on
    grounds of general suitability.  If he were wrong on that  point  then,
    recognising that the Appellant would not then be  entitled  to  succeed
    under the in immigration rules, Mr Parkin invited me  to  look  to  the
    wider application of  Article  8  ECHR  and  because,  in  Mr  Parkin's
    submission, the Appellant  only  just  fell  foul  of  the  suitability
    requirements, that was an important factor which ought to be  borne  in
    considering the issue of proportionality. I was invited  also  to  have
    regard to the age of the offences and to the fact  that  the  Appellant
    was an active carer for SW, a British citizen.

35. As to credibility, Mr Parkin invited  me  to  find  that  the  evidence
    between the Appellant and SW had  been  consistent  and  to  note  that
    whereas Judge Monson had found that it had not been credibly  explained
    why  SW  raised  the  topic  of  domestic  violence  with  her  general
    practitioner in August 2013, that was not a matter which was any longer
    pursued; there was no cross-examination about  it.  Accordingly  I  was
    invited to find that the domestic violence was at the hands of  an  ex-
    partner, as contended for by SW and  not  the  Appellant.   Ms  Everett
    confirmed that that issue was no longer live.

36. Mr Parkin then addressed each of the remaining reasons given  by  Judge
    Monson for dismissing the appeal. He submitted that there was an  error
    in finding that there was no history of panic attacks or mental  health
    problems and, in any event, relying on the guidance in the case of E  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department: R v Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department [2004] EWCA Civ 49, there was now  evidence  before
    the Upper Tribunal which ought to be taken into account.

37. Further or in the alternative Mr Parkin relied on Appendix FM-EX1(b) to
    the Immigration Rules which provides that  there  is  an  exception  to
    certain eligibility requirements for leave to remain as a partner which
    would apply if:

         "The applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
         partner who is in the United Kingdom  and  is  a  British  citizen,
         settled in the United Kingdom or in the United Kingdom with refugee
         leave or humanitarian  protection,  and  there  are  insurmountable
         obstacles to family life with that partner continuing  outside  the
         United Kingdom."

    This is defined in EX.2 to mean "very significant difficulties would be
    faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their family life
    together outside the United Kingdom and which could not be overcome  or
    would entail very serious hardship for the applicant or their partner".

38. Mr Parkin submitted that the evidence of SW  had  not  been  challenged
    with respect to her ability to fly or travel or her agoraphobia and  in
    those circumstances he submitted that the Secretary  of  State  had  no
    answer to the contention  that  there  were  insurmountable  obstacles.
    Finally it was  his  submission  that  the  Appellant  was  entitle  to
    succeed, in the alternative, having regard to the wider application  of
    Article 8 ECHR.

39. For the Secretary of State, Ms Everett submitted that  the  suitability
    requirements had not been met and whilst it was correct to say that the
    evidence of SW had not been challenged with regard to  her  ability  to
    fly and the like, the medical evidence did not say that she  could  not
    do so. The burden, she submitted, was on the Appellant and the evidence
    was lacking. It would be  open  to  the  Appellant  to  make  an  entry
    clearance  application.  Little  weight  should   be   given   to   the
    relationship given the precarious nature of  it  when  formed.  It  was
    further submitted that there  was  no  suggestion  that  SW  would  not
    receive support in  the  United  Kingdom  during  any  absence  of  the
    Appellant while  he  sought  to  make  regular  his  status  by  making
    application from abroad.

40. Mr Parkin responded simply to make the point that the guidance  in  the
    case of Bossade (SS.117-A-D- Inter Relationship with Rules)  [2015]  UK
    UT00415 that little weight should be given to the precarious nature  of
    the relationship, when looking to the public interest, if the Appellant
    were entitled to succeed under the rule.

Findings

41. Whether the Appellant succeeds under Appendix FM is dependant  upon  my
    finding with respect to his presence being conducive to the public good
    or  otherwise.   If  the  Appellant  fails  to  meet  the   suitability
    requirement then EX1 also  falls  away  given  the  guidance  in  Sabir
    (Appendix FM -EX.1 not Freestanding) [2014] UK UT00063 (IAC).

42. No point was  taken  on  the  construction  of  S-LTR.1.5.  The  agreed
    question for me was whether the Appellant was a persistent offender. It
    is important to note that the rule is written in the present tense  and
    so I am concerned with the situation as it now is.  The matters  relied
    upon by the Secretary of State are as follows:

         22 May 2003  -  driving  whilst  disqualified  and  driving  whilst
         uninsured - 28 days imprisonment with licence endorsed.

         20  June  2004  -  driving  whilst  disqualified,  driving   whilst
         uninsured and  failing  to  surrender  to  custody  -  sentence  to
         community punishment order of 40 hours, disqualified  from  driving
         for six months and licence endorsed with fine �50.

         25 September 2004 - driving  whilst  disqualified,  driving  whilst
         uninsured sentenced to tree month curfew order,  disqualified  from
         driving three months and licence endorsed.

         7 September 2015 - convicted of  possession  of  cannabis,  driving
         otherwise in and in accordance with the licence and driving  whilst
         uninsured - fined �150 with �55  costs,  licence  endorsed  and  12
         month conditional discharge.

         11 April 2008 - caution for possession of cannabis.

         5 September 2008 - conviction of possession of a controlled article
         - suspended prison sentence and twelve weeks supervision order with
         residence requirement.

         15 January 2009 - conviction of breach of community order with  the
         order revoked.

         2  March  2010  -  theft  and  failure  to  comply  with  community
         requirement.   Imprisonment  two  weeks  and  ten  weeks   to   run
         consecutively.

         23 April 2011 - conviction for theft - sentenced to community order
         and supervision requirement with unpaid  work  requirement  of  100
         hours.

         25 April 2011 - conviction of theft and  failure  to  surrender  to
         custody sentenced to a community order and supervision  requirement
         with unpaid work requirement of 100 hours.

         11 August 2011 -  conviction  of  theft  sentenced  to  supervision
         requirement, community order and costs of �100.

43. I am assisted in the proper approach that I should take by the guidance
    in Farquharson (Removal - Proof of Conduct) [2013]  UK  UT00146  (IAC).
    The guidance in that case was as follows:

         "1)  Where the Respondent relies on the allegations of  conduct  in
             proceedings for removal, the same principles apply as to proof
             of conduct and the assessment of risk to  the  public,  as  in
             deportation cases: Bah [2012] UK UT196(IAC) applicable.

         2)   A criminal charge that has not resulted in a conviction is not
             a criminal record; but the act that led to the charge  may  be
             established as conduct..."

44. I would observe however that this is not a deportation case and so  the
    first point in Farquarson is to be read together with the  guidance  in
    Clarke ("Section 117C - limited  to  deportation")  [2015]  UKUT  00628
    (IAC)

45. I should add that in interpreting the suitability of requirement  I  am
    mindful of the guidance in Mahad (Ethiopia) v Entry  Clearance  Officer
    [2009] UK SC16 at paragraph 10 of that judgment in which Lord Brown who
    gave the lead judgment placed reliance on Lord  Hoffman's  analysis  in
    Odeola v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] UK SC25 that
    the construction of an immigration rule relies upon the language of the
    rule construed against the relevant background and concludes that: "The
    rules are not be construed with all the strictness  applicable  to  the
    construction of a statute  or  a  statutory  instrument  but,  instead,
    sensibly according to the natural and ordinary  meaning  of  the  words
    used."

46. In short the Appellant was someone who broke the law over  a  prolonged
    period but as I have observed the rule is framed in the present  tense.
    There is no doubt that the Appellant was a persistent offender but  the
    question that I have to resolve is whether  he  is.   At  the  date  of
    decision, 6 November 2014, the Appellant had not committed any  offence
    for going on three years.  It  is  now  over  four  years.   Using  the
    ordinary language of the rule, the Appellant was a persistent  offender
    but in my judgment it cannot be said any longer that he is.  Given that
    the suitability requirement relied upon by the Secretary of State falls
    away the question is whether  the  Appellant  is  entitled  to  succeed
    having regard to EX1.

47. In this case it was common ground that if the Appellant were to succeed
    under the immigration rules he would have to demonstrate a genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with SW  and  that  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles in  family  life  with  her  continuing  outside  the  United
    Kingdom.

48. Having heard the evidence of SW I am satisfied that there is a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship.  SW addressed the various concerns of  the
    Secretary of State and indeed  Judge  Monson.   She  explained  why  no
    documentation pre-dated  2014  and  I  accept  that  explanation.   The
    documentation is consistent with  SW  having  suffered  a  major  heart
    attack in 2014.  I accept that at that point that the Appellant  needed
    to "sort things out" and the more so since he was now married.

49. Despite the Reasons for Refusal letter, Ms Everett  quite  rightly  did
    not purse the challenge to the validity of the marriage and I  observe,
    in addition to the satisfactory explanations given by SW in the  course
    of cross-examination to the questions put, that  she  attended  at  the
    Appellant's appeal notwithstanding her ill  health  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, and on the appeal hearing to the Upper Tribunal.  That is  as
    relevant a factor as it would have been had she not attended.   Finally
    I take into account the corroborative evidence of Dr Braithwaite who in
    his letter of 10 February 2015, speaks of the importance  of  the  role
    the Appellant plays in the life of his wife. I am  satisfied  therefore
    that on balance  of  probabilities  the  relationship  is  genuine  and
    subsisting.

50. The issue then is whether there are insurmountable obstacles.  That  SW
    cannot fly and is agoraphobic was not challenged. Despite Ms  Everett's
    submission that there was no supporting  evidence,  Dr  Farley  in  her
    letter of 6 November 2015 makes reference to documented  panic  attacks
    going back to 2013, often precipitated by leaving the house. The letter
    says that SW, in these circumstances often avoids  leaving  the  house.
    That is at least corroborative of the contention that  SW  cannot  fly.
    Taking into account what I was told by SW and all the medical evidence,
    I find as a fact that she  is  not  someone  who  reasonably  could  be
    expected to make the journey to Jamaica.

51. I remind myself that I am not making this decision as a first  instance
    judge but am remaking the decision of Judge  Monson.  He  set  out  his
    reasons for dismissing the appeal at paragraphs 27 to 32. The Appellant
    has met each and every reason given by Judge Monson for dismissing  the
    appeal.

52. I have found that the difficulties that  would  face  this  couple  are
    established and are sufficient to meet EX.1 but I  must  also  consider
    not only if there would be "serious hardship" but whether it  would  be
    "very serious hardship".

53. I accept, given the medical conditions from which she suffers  and  her
    current state of health that it would be wholly unreasonable to  expect
    the Appellant to leave the United Kingdom in order to make  application
    to return.  The impact upon SW  is  likely  to  be  very  serious.  The
    medical evidence points to it and  whilst  Ms  Everett  invited  me  to
    accept that there would be support  available  during  the  Appellant's
    uncertain period of absence she was not able to point to  what  support
    would be available, whereas the medical evidence pointed to the current
    strain on resources and the deleterious effect that would  have  on  SW
    absent her husband who I accept has taken on the role of carer as  well
    as husband.  The  effect  upon  SW  would  in  my  judgment  be  wholly
    disproportionate to what the Secretary of State seeks to  achieve.   In
    those circumstances it is not necessary for  me  to  go  to  the  wider
    application of Article 8 because I find that  the  rule  satisfactorily
    deals with the issues which arise.

54. A word of caution to the Appellant, the commission of a further offence
    might be said, once again, to render him a persistent offender!

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error  of  law  and  is
set aside.  The decision is remade such that the  appeal  is  allowed  under
the Immigration Rules.
