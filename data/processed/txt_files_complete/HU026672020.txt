For the Respondent:    Mr. S Kotas, Senior Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Sangha ('the Judge'), sent to the parties on 17 November 2020,
    by which the appellant's appeal against a decision of the respondent to
    refuse a human rights claim and to maintain  a  deportation  order  was
    dismissed.

 2. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Adio granted the appellant  permission
    to appeal to this Tribunal by a decision dated 30 December 2020. Though
    the clear intention of Judge  Adio  was  not  to  grant  the  appellant
    permission to appeal on ground  1,  he  did  not  limit  the  grant  of
    permission in the section of the standard form document  that  contains
    the decision and so the grant of permission to appeal is considered  by
    this Tribunal to be on all grounds:  Safi  and  others  (permission  to
    appeal decisions) [2018] UKUT 00388 (IAC), [2019] Imm AR 437.

Remote Hearing

 3. The hearing before me was a Skype for Business video conference hearing
    held during the Covid-19 pandemic. I was present in a hearing  room  at
    Field House. The hearing room and the building were open to the public.
    The hearing and its start time were listed in the  cause  list.  I  was
    addressed by the representatives in exactly the same way as if we  were
    together in the hearing room. I am satisfied: that this  constituted  a
    hearing in open  court;  that  the  open  justice  principle  has  been
    secured; that no party has been prejudiced; and that, insofar as  there
    has been any restriction on a right or interest,  it  is  justified  as
    necessary and proportionate.

Anonymity

 4. The Judge made an anonymity order, simply reasoning at  the  conclusion
    of his decision that 'there are four young children  involved  in  this
    appeal'.

 5. The requirement that justice  should  be  administered  openly  and  in
    public is a fundamental tenet of the domestic  justice  system.  It  is
    inextricably linked to freedom of the press and  so  any  order  as  to
    anonymity must be necessary and reasoned: R. (Yalland) v. Secretary  of
    State for Exiting the European Union [2017] EWHC 630 (Admin).

 6. The public enjoys a common law right to know  about  court  proceedings
    and such right is also protected by article 10 ECHR.

 7. As observed by the Supreme Court In re Guardian News and Media Ltd  and
    Others [2010] UKSC 1, [2010] 2 AC 697 where both articles 8 and  10  of
    the ECHR are in play, it is for the Tribunal  to  weigh  the  competing
    claims under each article. Since both article  8  and  article  10  are
    qualified rights, the weight to be attached to the respective interests
    of the parties and family members will depend on the facts. A Judge  is
    therefore obliged to provide reasons as to why article  10  rights  are
    given lesser weight than those  given  to  the  appellant's  article  8
    rights. Such reasons  may  permissibly  be  short,  with  reference  to
    Guidance Note 2013, No. 1 which is concerned with anonymity orders, but
    they are required.

 8. Rule 14(1) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  ('the
    2008 Rules')  contains  a  power  to  make  an  order  prohibiting  the
    publication of information relating to the proceedings or of any matter
    likely to lead members of the public to identify any  person  whom  the
    Upper Tribunal considers should not be identified.

 9. Guidance Note 2013 No 1  addresses  considerations  to  be  applied  to
    children at paras. 18 to 20. The identity of children whether they  are
    appellants or the children of an appellant (or otherwise concerned with
    the proceedings), will not normally be disclosed nor will their school,
    the names of their teacher or any social worker or health  professional
    with whom they are concerned, unless there  are  good  reasons  in  the
    interests of justice to do so. Where the identity of a child is not  to
    be revealed the name and address of a parent other than  the  appellant
    may also need to be withheld to preserve  the  anonymity  of  a  child.
    Consequently, there is no mandatory requirement that an anonymity order
    be made in respect of an appellant simply because they have a child  or
    children.

10. I note the recent observation of Elisabeth Laing  LJ  in  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department v. Starkey [2021] EWCA Civ 421, at  [97]-
    [98], made in the context  of  deportation  proceedings  consequent  to
    sexual offences, that defendants in criminal  proceedings  are  usually
    not anonymised. Both the First-tier Tribunal and this Tribunal  are  to
    be mindful of such fact. The appellant in this matter has already  been
    subject to the open  justice  principle  in  respect  of  his  criminal
    convictions, which are a matter of public record and so  considered  to
    be known by the local community.

11. I am aware that the appellant's conviction was reported in the media. I
    am also mindful that the media may  well  be  interested  in  reporting
    these proceedings consequent to previous coverage  of  the  appellant's
    conviction. Such reporting  would,  on  its  face,  be  in  the  public
    interest. The appellant and another man set up an immigration  advisory
    firm in Essex, called East London  Legal  Centre,  offering  advice  on
    immigration  matters  and  submitting  in  the  region  of   400   visa
    applications containing false documents to the respondent.  The  second
    defendant, Mr. Ifelola Owoseni, falsely claimed to  be  an  immigration
    solicitor  and  neither  man  was  registered  by  the  Office  of  the
    Immigration Services Commissioner. In the circumstances, the public can
    properly be considered to have  an  interest  in  knowing  whether  the
    appellant is, or is not, to be deported.

12. I observe the Editors' Code of Practice which provides that editors  of
    newspapers 'must not use the fame, notoriety or position of a parent or
    guardian as sole justification for  publishing  details  of  a  child's
    private life'. The Tribunal can properly expect editors to abide by the
    Code of Practice.

13. Upon considering the papers filed in this matter, I am  satisfied  that
    there is no requirement that  the  appellant's  wife  and  children  be
    named, nor is there any requirement to identify where the  family  live
    nor for details to be given as to the schools the children attend.

14. I am satisfied that article 8 rights in this  matter  do  not  outweigh
    relevant article 10 rights so as to diminish the right of the public to
    know about the appellant and these  proceedings.  Consequently,  I  set
    aside the anonymity order made by the Judge.

Background

15. The appellant is a national of Nigeria and is presently aged 51.

Family Life

16. The appellant and his present partner were in a relationship with  each
    other in Nigeria and the couple's first child was born in 2004.

17. The appellant married a French national in Cote d'Ivoire on 6 May 2006.

18. The appellant's partner married an EEA national in 2006.

19. The appellant was granted entry clearance as a visitor and entered  the
    United Kingdom on 11 May 2006. He  overstayed.  In  September  2008  he
    successfully applied for an EEA Residence Card  on  the  basis  of  his
    marriage to his wife. The Residence Card was  issued  on  23  September
    2009 and valid for five years until 23 September 2014.

20. The appellant's partner applied for an EEA Residence Card in 2009, 2010
    and 2011 on the basis of her marriage to an EEA national.

21. In 2007, a second child was born to the couple in the  United  Kingdom,
    13 months after the appellant arrived in this  country  and  17  months
    after  he  married  his  French  national  wife.  The   child's   birth
    certificate confirms that the couple were living together at  the  time
    of the second child's birth.

22. The second child was born before  the  appellant's  application  for  a
    residence card in September 2008.

23. Their third child was born in this country in 2009. The address on  the
    third child's birth certificate confirms that the couple moved property
    together at least once following the birth of their second child.

24. The appellant's partner was  residing  with  the  appellant  and  their
    children when she applied for an EEA Residence Card.

25. The appellant divorced his French national wife on 6 November 2012.

26. The couple  are  also  recorded  as  residing  together  on  the  birth
    certificate of their fourth child, issued in 2013.

27. The appellant's partner and  youngest  child  are  Nigerian  nationals,
    enjoying leave to remain until 2021.  The  three  eldest  children  are
    British.

Index Offence

28. On 23 December 2013 the appellant was convicted  at  Wood  Green  Crown
    Court of assisting unlawful immigration into  the  European  Union  and
    sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment. He was also convicted on the same
    day of providing immigration advice or service in contravention of  the
    prohibition  and  sentenced  to   6   months   imprisonment,   to   run
    consecutively.

29.  In  sentencing  the  appellant,  HHJ  Patrick  observed  that   having
    previously worked at a law centre  the  appellant's  co-defendant,  Mr.
    Owoseni, decided to place the name of a genuine solicitor onto  writing
    paper and set out to give the impression that he was a solicitor.  Both
    defendants were found after a trial to have  used  their  knowledge  of
    immigration  law  to  exploit  applicants  who  approached   them   for
    immigration  advice.  Though  there  was  no  evidence  that  the   two
    defendants advertised their services, HHJ Patrick  was  satisfied  that
    their reputation  spread  by  word-of-mouth,  to  the  point  that  the
    defendants moved premises twice as business grew.  By  2010  they  were
    working at premises requiring rental payment of �15,000 per annum.  HHJ
    Patrick was satisfied that consequent to  documentation  found  by  the
    police  at  the  premises  false  applications  were  being   submitted
    accompanied by false documents and false evidence.  At  the  sentencing
    hearing HHJ Patrick identified as an  indication  of  what  steps  were
    being taken by the defendants that photographs  purporting  to  show  a
    Nigerian wedding were in fact taken in the defendants' office.

30. In respect of the appellant, HHJ Patrick observed:

         'He is clearly an intelligent man. He made an application  to  live
         in this country on the basis of marrying a European  national.  The
         evidence of his interview suggests that the marriage was a sham. He
         was in his late 20s[1] and married a woman of 17 from  whom  he  is
         now divorced, having recently had a child by  another  woman,  with
         whom he has gone on to have three more.'

         '... You, Ogunmakin, worked there over a lengthy period, and as the
         jury found, provided advice and assisted in  the  making  of  false
         applications.'

         'You both  contested  the  case,  though  neither  compounded  your
         dishonesty by giving evidence.  Nevertheless,  you  have  exploited
         vulnerable people. Those without legitimate  incomes  were  charged
         significant sums of money for what you did. Some  were  successful,
         others weren't. ... These offences  strike  at  the  heart  of  our
         immigration system.'

31. On 4  September  2014,  the  respondent  revoked  the  appellant's  EEA
    Residence Card as the appellant's marriage to an EEA national was found
    to have not been entered into genuinely, and so was  considered  to  be
    one of convenience.

32. On 20 September 2014, the appellant applied for an EEA residence  card.
    The respondent refused this application on 5 December 2014.  A  request
    for reconsideration was made on 1 March 2015 and refused.

33. The respondent signed a deportation order on 12  February  2015,  which
    was served on the appellant on 31 March 2015.

34. The appellant served further representations dated 1 April and 4  April
    2015 requesting that the deportation order be revoked on article  2,  3
    and 8 grounds.   On  8  April  2015  the  appellant  submitted  further
    submissions, which included a claim for asylum based upon a  feud  with
    other individuals that commenced whilst his  father  was  acting  as  a
    traditional ruler. He stated that the feud had led  to  the  deaths  of
    three sisters and four cousins following 'spiritual attacks'.

35. He attended an interview with the respondent on 13  October  2015.  The
    respondent refused the application by a decision dated 29 December 2015
    and, having taken the appellant's claim at its highest,  certified  the
    international protection and  human  rights  claims  as  being  clearly
    unfounded under section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002 ('the 2002 Act').

36.  A  subsequent  judicial  review  challenge  to   this   decision   was
    unsuccessful following an oral  hearing  held  in  November  2016.  The
    appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal and in line  with  an  agreed
    consent order consequent to the Supreme Court judgment in R (Kiarie and
    Byndloss) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 42,
    [2017] 1 W.L.R. 2380  the  respondent  withdrew  her  decisions  of  12
    February 2015 and 29 December 2015.

37. On 26 September 2017, the respondent issued  a  decision  refusing  the
    appellant's  international  protection  and  human  rights  claim.  The
    appellant  exercised  statutory  appeal  rights,  and  his  appeal  was
    dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal on 5 February 2018. Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Chohan determined, inter alia:

          . The appellant enjoyed a genuine and subsisting family life  with
            his wife and children.

          . The appellant had committed a serious offence.

          . There was no doubt that if the appellant were to be removed this
            would have a significant impact upon the children.  However,  it
            was open for the children to go to Nigeria with their father.

          . Both the appellant's partner and the children enjoyed no  status
            in this country.

          . It would not be unduly harsh for the children to remain in  this
            country without their father.

          .  There  were  no   compelling   circumstances   preventing   the
            appellant's partner from living in this country without him.

38. The appellant unsuccessfully sought to appeal the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal and became appeal rights exhausted on 9 January 2019.

39. Following the promulgation of Judge Chohan's decision, the  appellant's
    eldest  three  children  were  naturalised  as  British  citizens.  The
    appellant's partner was granted limited leave to remain in this country
    in February 2019.

40. On 7 March 2019 the appellant lodged further human rights  (article  8)
    submissions which were refused by the respondent by means of a decision
    dated 5 February 2020.

Hearing before the FtT

41. The appeal came before the Judge sitting in Birmingham  on  28  October
    2020. In refusing the human rights appeal  the  Judge  noted  that  the
    appellant had not engaged in any further criminal  activity  consequent
    to his release from prison, at [22] of the decision:

         '22.  From all the evidence which has been placed before  me  I  am
             satisfied that the Appellant  committed  serious  offences  and
             that is reflected in the sentence which was imposed  upon  him.
             Nevertheless, I also note that the Appellant does not have  any
             other criminal convictions and according  to  the  Pre-Sentence
             Report which was before the Criminal Court  the  appellant  was
             recognised as being presenting [sic] a  low  risk  of  harm  to
             others. I  also  take  account  of  the  fact  that  since  the
             Appellant was released from prison he has not  engaged  in  any
             further criminal activity.'

42. The Judge accepted that the appellant  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    family life with his partner and four children,  at  [21].  He  further
    accepted that if the appellant were to be removed there would  be  such
    interference in family life as to engage article 8, at [21].

43. As for the children, the Judge accepted that it would be in their  best
    interests for them to remain with their father in one family  unit,  at
    [24]. The Judge observed that the status of the appellant's partner and
    children had changed since family life was considered by  Judge  Chohan
    in 2018, and three of the children were now British citizens, at  [24].
    However, the Judge determined, at [24]:

         '24. ... I take into  account  that  both  the  Appellant  and  his
             partner are Nigerian nationals and were born and brought up  in
             this country. They came to the UK  at  a  mature  age  and  had
             therefore spent the most formative and majority of their  lives
             in Nigeria and not the UK. It is clear that they  are  familiar
             with the culture, customs and language or languages of Nigeria.
             If the Appellant and his family choose  to  return  to  Nigeria
             they will be doing so as one family  unit.  The  four  children
             will be supported by both their parents. Whilst I note that the
             family have lived together in the UK there does not seem to  be
             any reason why they could not continue to do so as  one  family
             unit in Nigeria. Whilst I appreciate that initially there would
             be some hardship and inconvenience for the family  as  a  whole
             and no doubt it would take some time for the children to  adapt
             to life in Nigeria,  nevertheless,  I  am  satisfied  that  the
             Appellant and his partner would be able to make adjustments and
             ensure that the children would be able  to  adapt  to  life  in
             Nigeria. In this respect I have taken  into  account  that  the
             children are innocent of any  wrongdoing  and  are  not  to  be
             blamed for  their  parents'  misdemeanours.  I  note  that  the
             Appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment  despite  the
             fact that it had an adverse impact on his children but as Judge
             Chohan found "that  does  not  mean  the  children  were  being
             punished". Equally, I find that the deportation of a parent and
             requiring children to  leave  is  not  something  that  may  be
             considered to  be  punishment  for  the  children.  It  is  the
             consequences of their parents' offending. Even though three  of
             the children are now British nationals and one of the  children
             has been resident here for more  than  seven  years  and  their
             mother now has limited leave to remain in the UK, nevertheless,
             in my assessment, for all the reasons that I have set out above
             I find that it would not be unduly harsh for the children to go
             to Nigeria with the appellant and their mother. The  children's
             best interests, on the facts of this case, and bearing in  mind
             the findings of Judge Chohan in the previous determination,  in
             my assessment, do not outweigh the strong  public  interest  in
             deporting the Appellant, a foreign criminal. I  find  that  the
             circumstances which were before Judge Chohan in  February  2018
             are not substantially different now.'

44. The Judge further found that it would  not  be  unduly  harsh  for  the
    children to remain in this country without their father,  observing  at
    [25]:

         '25. ...  in that respect I note that when  the  Appellant  was  in
             prison clearly that had an  impact  on  the  children  and  the
             family as a whole, they were cared for by their mother and they
             managed to survive and cope. I note that he  was  supported  by
             Social Services  who  visited  them  regularly  and  they  were
             supported financially. I find  that  there  is  no  substantial
             evidence before me which would suggest that  it  is  absolutely
             imperative that the Appellant be present in the UK  to  prevent
             any adverse effect on the children's health or  development  or
             their care. There is no evidence before me  to  show  that  the
             children would lose any contact with the Appellant because they
             can maintain contact with their father by telephone, email  and
             other modern means of communication and, of course, it would be
             open to the children to visit their father in Nigeria. Whilst I
             note that if the Appellant is  deported  to  Nigeria  that  his
             partner would be looking after  the  children  virtually  as  a
             single mother I find that it is possible for her to adjust  her
             working hours just as single mothers do in general. There is no
             evidence before me that the Appellant  would  not  be  able  to
             support himself bearing in mind that he has  worked  previously
             in Nigeria. I note that the Appellant played down his  contacts
             and connections and family ties in Nigeria even to  the  extent
             [of] saying that he did not have any contact  or  know  of  the
             whereabouts of his mother but I found that hard to believe.  In
             all the circumstances, therefore,  having  considered  all  the
             evidence before me in the round, I find that it  would  not  be
             unduly harsh for the children to remain in the UK without their
             father, the Appellant.'

45. The Judge determined that there were  no  compelling  circumstances  to
    demonstrate that the appellant's partner was  not  able  to  return  to
    Nigeria with the appellant, at [27]. In the alternative there  were  no
    compelling circumstances which would prevent her  from  living  in  the
    United Kingdom without the appellant, at [28].

Grounds of Appeal

46. The appellant relies upon four grounds of appeal that can  properly  be
    summarised as follows:

         1) The  Judge  erred  at  [22]  of  his  decision  by  engaging  in
            speculation when concluding it would not be unduly harsh for the
            children to remain as part of the family unit upon relocating to
            Nigeria.

         2) The Judge gave inadequate weight  to  the  fact  that  all  four
            children have spent between 7 to 15 years in this  country,  and
            therefore  can  be  considered  to  have  be  fully  integrated.
            Disruption to  their  education  would  not  be  in  their  best
            interests.  Further  the  Judge  engaged  in  speculation   when
            concluding that the children can easily reintegrate  and  resume
            their education in Nigeria.

         3) The Judge failed to give proper consideration and due weight  to
            the social services' letter filed with the Tribunal.

         4) The Judge disregarded the  guidance  as  to  the  definition  of
            'unduly harsh' provided by the Court of Appeal in HA  (Iraq)  v.
            Secretary of State for the Home Department [2020] EWCA Civ 1176,
            [2021] 1 W.L.R. 1327.

47. In granting permission to appeal Judge Adio gave reasons as to  why  he
    considered ground 1 to lack merit:

         '2.   ...  Reference  is  made  to  paragraph  22  of  the  judge's
             determination in assessment of the  issue  as  to  whether  the
             children would be able to remain a family  by  travelling  with
             the Applicant back to Nigeria and  in  locating  there.  It  is
             argued that the judge erred in stating that "whilst I note that
             the family have lived together in the UK there does not seem to
             be any reason why they could not  continue  to  do  so  as  one
             family unit in Nigeria". The grounds argue that since the elder
             three of the four children are British  nationals,  they  would
             have no automatic entitlement  to  return  to  Nigeria  equally
             because they are UK citizens, they would not be required in law
             to leave the UK. This ground does not raise an  arguable  error
             of law as the children  with  Nigerian  parents  will  also  be
             entitled to  apply  for  Nigerian  citizenship  and  return  to
             Nigeria.'

48. As to the remaining grounds, Judge Adio reasoned:

         '3.   ... However, based on the evidence  submitted  and  which  is
             attached to the grounds Miss Stacey Beason of  Social  Services
             states in her letter that the children have  historically  been
             [known to social services] due to [the appellant's partner] not
             being able to cope while Mr. Ogunmakin  was  serving  a  prison
             sentence. The children have a  strong  relationship  with  both
             parents and the impact of Mr. Ogunmakin  being  separated  from
             the family would be detrimental to their health and well-being.
             The letter goes on to state  that  Mr.  Ogunmakin's  emotional,
             material, domestic and academic support  for  his  partner  and
             four children is immeasurable and the negative  effect  of  his
             separation from the family would be unduly harsh and result  in
             devastating psychological consequences for the four children.

         4.  It is arguable that there is no proper consideration  given  to
             these conclusions. the judge's finding is  that  there  are  no
             compelling circumstances to demonstrate that  [the  appellant's
             partner] would not be  able  to  return  to  Nigeria  with  the
             Applicant. It is arguable the Applicant's deportation would  be
             unduly harsh for the three British children and  their  mother,
             as well as the fourth child who has continuously been  resident
             in the UK over seven years if in fact they choose not to go  to
             Nigeria ...'





Decision on Error of Law

49. Mr. Khan confirmed at the hearing that grounds 1 and  2  are  concerned
    with the Judge's conclusion that it would not be unduly harsh  for  the
    appellant's children to accompany him to Nigeria and continue to  be  a
    family unit in that country. Grounds 3 and 4  are  concerned  with  the
    Judge's conclusion that it would not be unduly harsh for  the  children
    to be separated from their father upon his deportation to Nigeria.

50. The core section of ground 1 details:

          '1.1.1 In the first place, the FTTJ errs in principle  because  he
             speculates; in simple terms there was no evidence  before  the
             FTTJ for him to conclude that 'there does not seem to  be  any
             reason why they could not continue to do so as one family unit
             in Nigeria ...' In fact since the  elder  three  of  the  four
             children are British nationals, they would have  no  automatic
             entitlement to return to Nigeria, equally because they are  UK
             citizens they could not be compelled/required in law to  leave
             the UK.'

51. I observe at the  outset  that  the  non-compellability  of  a  British
    citizen  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom  is  not  determinative   when
    considering the position of a child in relation to section 117C of  the
    2002 Act or paragraphs 398 and 399 of the Immigration Rules.  In  Patel
    (British citizen child -  deportation)  [2020]  UKUT  00045  (IAC)  the
    Tribunal confirmed that  when  considering  both  section  117C(5)  and
    paragraph 399(a)(ii), judicial decision-makers are required to assess a
    hypothetical question, namely  whether  going  or  staying  'would'  be
    unduly harsh. They are  not  being  asked  to  undertake  a  predictive
    factual analysis as to whether  a  child  will  in  fact  go  or  stay.
    Nationality in the form of British citizenship  is  a  relevant  factor
    when assessing whether the 'unduly harsh' requirement is met, but it is
    not necessarily a weighty factor. The Tribunal further  confirmed  that
    the possession of British citizenship by a child with whom an appellant
    has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship does not  mean  that
    the appellant is exempted from the 'unduly harsh' requirements.

52. At the hearing Mr. Khan  reflected  upon  relevant  provisions  of  the
    Constitution of Nigeria (1999).  He accepted that all four children are
    Nigerian nationals. The eldest child was born in  Nigeria  to  Nigerian
    parents  and  secured  Nigerian  nationality  from  birth  through  the
    operation of section 25(1)(b) of the Constitution.  The  three  younger
    children were born in the United Kingdom to  Nigerian  parents  and  so
    secured Nigerian nationality through birth consequent to the  operation
    of section 25(1)(c).

53. In respect of the three eldest  children  having  been  naturalised  as
    British citizens such process did not  automatically  result  in  their
    losing their Nigerian nationality. Nigerians are permitted to hold dual
    nationality unless their Nigerian citizenship was acquired  other  than
    through birth: section 28 of the Constitution.

54. Mr. Khan conceded that there is no evidence before this  Tribunal  that
    the eldest  children  have  renounced  their  Nigerian  citizenship  in
    accordance with section 29 of the Constitution. This is unsurprising as
    the Tribunal observes that the children are not of an  age  where  they
    can renounce their citizenship. In the circumstances, Mr. Khan withdrew
    reliance upon ground 1 at the hearing. The  Tribunal  is  content  that
    this was the only appropriate avenue available to the appellant.

55. By means of ground 2, the  appellant  submitted  that  the  Judge  gave
    insufficient weight to the length of time the children had been present
    in this country, and that they were fully integrated into  their  local
    community. It was asserted that the disruption to their  education  was
    clearly detrimental to their best interests, so  breaching  obligations
    established by section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration
    Act 2009. Mr. Khan  initially  submitted  that  the  Judge  engaged  in
    speculation when concluding that the children could easily  reintegrate
    and resume their education in Nigeria.

56. Mr. Khan accepted that nowhere within  the  evidence  authored  by  the
    children were concerns raised as to their integration  upon  relocating
    to Nigeria. The children were silent on  the  issue  in  their  letters
    which are themselves some two years old. He further accepted  that  the
    appellant's wife provided no evidence on this issue. The sole  evidence
    addressing relocation, in general  terms,  was  one  paragraph  in  the
    appellant's witness statement, dated 20 October 2020:

         '21. [The] United Kingdom is the only place  and  country  that  my
             four children have always known. It  is  the  only  country  to
             continue their lives because they have deeply immersed into the
             UK system and laid down roots over the years,  obtaining  their
             British citizenship! United  Kingdom  is  the  only  place  and
             country my four children have always  known.  It  is  the  only
             country to  continue  their  lives  because  they  have  deeply
             immersed into the UK system and lay down roots over the  years,
             obtaining  their  British  citizenship!  I  humbly  asked  that
             consideration be given to the extent of my cadet son's and  his
             siblings' private life in the UK, taking into  account  factors
             such as their ages, length of residence,  wider  considerations
             in the UK, other ties to the community to determine it would be
             unduly harsh to expect the children to live in a country  other
             than the UK please.'

57. Mr. Khan  acknowledged  that  such  evidence  as  relied  upon  by  the
    appellant provided  no  cogent  engagement  with  the  ability  of  his
    children to integrate, or otherwise, upon return to Nigeria. The  Judge
    expressly observed the children's length of residence in this  country,
    and that the eldest three  children  enjoyed  British  citizenship.  He
    noted that the children were innocent of any wrongdoing. He  considered
    the children's parents capable of helping them adapt  upon  relocation.
    In the circumstances, the Judge  could  reasonably  conclude  that  the
    children could adapt to life in Nigeria, though this may take time, and
    so it would not be unduly harsh for them to reside  with  their  father
    (and mother) in that country. Such conclusion cannot properly  be  said
    to be speculation. Upon careful reflection, Mr. Khan withdrew  reliance
    upon this ground at the hearing, and he was correct to do so.

58. The Tribunal confirmed in Patel that section 117C(5) of  the  2002  Act
    imposes the  same  two  requirements  as  are  specified  in  paragraph
    399(a)(ii) of the Immigration Rules, namely that  it  would  be  unduly
    harsh for a child to leave the United Kingdom and for a child to remain
    in this country, separated from their parent.  In  such  circumstances,
    with no extant challenge to the decision of the Judge that it would not
    be unduly harsh for the children to live with their father  in  Nigeria
    this appeal must be dismissed.

59. In any event, I proceed to consider the  remaining  grounds.  Ground  3
    details in simple terms:

         '1.3  Insofar as the issue whether or not it would be unduly  harsh
             to separate the father from his children, the FTTJ has erred in
             law because he failed to  give  proper  consideration  and  due
             weight to the report of Ms. Stacey Beason  of  Social  Services
             which amply demonstrates the great difficulty  the  family  had
             been coping in his absence  when  he  was  in  prison  and  the
             emotional harm it had on his children and partner.'

60. Ms. Beason is a social worker and her letter, dated 21 May  2018,  runs
    to 1� pages. In respect of the circumstances of the family at the  time
    the appellant was serving his custodial sentence, Ms. Beason's evidence
    is solely limited to one sentence where she confirms that the  children
    were at the relevant time known to social services because their mother
    was not able to cope whilst the appellant was in  prison.  No  more  of
    substance is said.

61. By means of paragraph 3.2.1 of his skeleton  argument  filed  with  the
    First-tier Tribunal Mr. Khan placed reliance upon Ms.  Beason's  letter
    as demonstrating 'the great difficulty the family had in coping in  his
    absence when he was in prison and the emotional  harm  it  had  on  his
    children and  partner'.  I  am  satisfied  that  when  considering  the
    decision in the round the Judge was clearly  aware  as  to  the  family
    difficulties that arose when the  appellant  was  imprisoned  some  six
    years previously. I am satisfied that Judge did consider  Ms.  Beason's
    letter, observing the appellant's reliance  upon  it  at  [23]  of  his
    decision and noting both the impact the  appellant's  imprisonment  had
    upon his family and the  support  provided  to  the  family  by  social
    services at [25].

62. As Mr. Khan developed his submission on this ground before me it became
    one as to the proper weight to be given to  Ms.  Beason's  letter.  The
    difficulty for the appellant is that the family circumstances  in  2013
    and 2014 are an unreliable indicator as to future  emotional  hardship.
    At the time of the appellant's  imprisonment  his  partner  enjoyed  no
    status in this country and was unable to work. The  children  were  all
    aged under 10 and the youngest was a babe in arms, being aged 5 months.
    The comprehension of the children as to the  appellant's  absence  from
    the family home was limited by their lack of  maturity.  The  household
    had lost its only breadwinner. By the time this appeal was heard by the
    Judge the children were aged 16, 13, 11 and 7. Three  of  the  children
    were attending secondary school. Their mother was permitted to work and
    indeed was doing so. The evidence presented to the Judge was silent  as
    to the actual or potential help that the older children could offer  to
    their mother and to their younger siblings  in  the  absence  of  their
    father. Mr. Khan accepted that the children were of an age  where  they
    would have a greater understanding as to the reasons why  they  may  be
    separated from their father.

63. There is no  merit  in  the  appellant's  submission  that  the  family
    circumstances in 2013 and early 2014 can lawfully  constitute  a  fixed
    basis for assessing  the  impact  of  future  separation.  Rather,  the
    Tribunal was required to consider circumstances as they presently stood
    and no cogent evidence was provided as to the children's present needs,
    abilities and understanding of events being such as to make  it  unduly
    harsh for them to be separated from their father. This narrow ground of
    challenge enjoys no merits.

64. As to ground 4, Mr. Khan accepted that elements of the ground stood  or
    fell with grounds 2 and 3. However, he relied upon paragraphs  1.4  and
    1.4.1:

         '1.4.    The FTTJ erred in law in disregarding the guidance on  the
              definition of 'unduly harsh' given by the Court of Appeal  in
              the case of HA (Iraq) and RA (Iraq) v. SSHD [2020]  EWCA  Civ
              1176.

         1.4.1.   In  particular,  it  is  arguable  that  FTTJ  failed   to
              appreciate that 'undue  harshness'  applicable  in  assessing
              offenders who have been sentenced to less than four years  in
              prison is not equivalent to 'very  compelling  circumstances'
              (as set out in NIAA 2002, s 117C(6) - which applies to  those
              offenders who have received sentences of four years or  more)
              and in circumstances may have applied the wrong  criteria  to
              the facts of this case.'

65. Mr. Khan accepted that his submission could be concisely identified  as
    the Judge having given  lip  service  to  the  unduly  harsh  test  but
    applying a higher test.

66. I am satisfied that the Judge clearly understood and applied the unduly
    harsh test. There is  no  requirement  that  a  judge  be  required  to
    expressly refer to specific authorities in a  judgment.  The  Court  of
    Appeal has recently  reminded  appellate  tribunals  that  they  should
    assume that experienced judges in specialised  tribunals  are  applying
    relevant principles, without the need for extensive citation, unless it
    was clear from what they said that they had not done so:  AA  (Nigeria)
    v. Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2020]  EWCA  Civ  1296,
    [2020] I.N.L.R. 599, at [34].

67. The authoritative guidance on 'unduly harsh' has been  set  out  in  KO
    (Nigeria) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] UKSC 53,
    [2018] 1 WLR 5273 and HA (Iraq). It  involves  a  degree  of  harshness
    going beyond what would necessarily be involved  for  any  child  faced
    with the deportation of a parent. That does not posit some  objectively
    measurable standard of harshness which is acceptable  but  sets  a  bar
    which is more elevated than mere undesirability but not as high as  the
    'very compelling circumstances' test.

68. Upon a careful reading of the decision, the Judge clearly had  in  mind
    that three of the children were British citizens and  that  the  family
    had previously struggled during their separation from the appellant  in
    2013 to 2014. Mr. Khan  complained  as  to  Judge  observing  that  the
    children  'managed  to  survive  and  cope'  when  their   father   was
    imprisoned. This is clearly  a  reference  to  past  circumstances  and
    cannot properly be said to form part of the unduly harsh assessment.  I
    am satisfied that the Judge did not elevate the  undue  harshness  test
    into one equating to 'very compelling circumstances'.  This  ground  is
    therefore dismissed.

69. For the reasons detailed, this appeal must be dismissed.

Postscript

70. By means of the appellant's grounds of appeal, there was an application
    to adduce fresh evidence that was said  not  to  be  available  at  the
    hearing before the Judge. The documents concerned are a report from Mr.
    Matthew Akal, Consultant  Chartered  Clinical  Psychologist,  dated  26
    November 2020, and an independent social worker's  report  authored  by
    Charles Musendo, dated 28 November 2020.

71. The grounds detail, at paragraph 1.5.1.:

         '1.5.1. It is submitted that these reports confirm  (i)  the  long-
              term harm to the family (ii) the inadequacy of modern methods
              of communication as a substitute for parents  [sic]  physical
              presence in maintaining the emotion [sic]  and  psychological
              well-being of the children and [A]'s partner.  These  reports
              corroborate the findings of Ms. Beatson's  [sic]  the  report
              which was before the  FTT.  The  FTT  [sic]  is  respectfully
              invited to allow [A] to rely on the above as  it  is  in  the
              interest of justice will enable the court  [sic]  to  make  a
              fair assessment of the best interest of [A]'s minor  children
              pursuant to  its  duty  under  section  55  of  the  Borders,
              Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.'

72. At the error of law hearing before me Mr. Khan quite correctly did  not
    seek to make an application to adduce these documents under rule 15(2A)
    of the 2008 Rules. I was informed that if the decision of the Judge was
    set aside the  appellant  would  make  such  application  so  that  the
    documents would be before the Tribunal at the resumed hearing.

73. As I have dismissed the appeal, there  is  no  requirement  for  me  to
    consider these documents. However, two issues arise that have led me to
    decide that I should make observations as to the  proposed  application
    and the report of Mr. Musendo.

74. I observe that the hearing before the Judge was held on 28 October 2020
    and the decision was sent to  the  parties  on  17  November  2020.  No
    application  for  an  adjournment  was  sought  before  the  Judge   in
    expectation of these reports.

75. Mr. Musendo commenced conducting his  interviews  in  relation  to  the
    assessment  on  22  November  2020.  The  interview  process  therefore
    commenced  some  five  days  after  the  decision  of  the  Judge   was
    promulgated. Mr. Akal's meeting with the appellant and his family  took
    place on 23 November 2020.

76. I express my concern as to the readiness of  the  appellant  to  secure
    purportedly  relevant  evidence  so  soon  after  Judge's  decision  in
    circumstances where no information is given as to why such evidence was
    not secured prior to the appeal hearing. There is  appropriate  concern
    as to the drip-by-drip nature of the production  of  evidence  in  this
    matter which goes against the public interest in an appellant  enjoying
    a statutory appeal and upon the exhaustion  of  such  appeal  rights  a
    deportation order being lawfully acted upon. In this matter two  judges
    have confirmed as lawful decisions of  the  respondent  to  deport  the
    appellant and not to grant him leave to remain in this country on human
    rights grounds.

77. As to Mr. Musendo's report I indicated to Mr. Khan at the conclusion of
    the hearing that I had concerns as to its uncritical nature.  The  lack
    of critical analysis may undermine  the  report's  conclusions.  It  is
    unhelpful  for  legal  representatives  to  fail  to  provide  relevant
    information to an expert, and it appears that  the  appellant's  former
    solicitors do not appear to have provided Mr. Musendo with  either  HHJ
    Patrick's  sentencing  remarks  or  the  decision  of   Judge   Chohan.
    Consequently,  when  addressing  the  appellant   and   his   partner's
    relationship history at �25 Mr. Musendo appears to be unaware that both
    the respondent and HHJ Patrick considered the appellant to have entered
    a marriage in 2006 solely with the intent of securing residence in this
    country. Further, no critical consideration is given to the marriage of
    the  appellant's  partner,  also  conducted  in  2006,  her  subsequent
    applications for an EEA Residence Card at a time when the  couple  were
    reunited in this country within at most months after their arrivals.  I
    observe that even when Mr. Musendo is aware  of  concerns  having  been
    raised as to the appellant's veracity, such as the Judge concluding  at
    [25] that it was 'hard to believe' that the appellant did not have  any
    contact  or  know  the  whereabouts  of  his  mother,  he  proceeds  to
    uncritically accept the appellant's  contention  that  he  has  severed
    relationships with family members.

78. I observe that no consideration is given by Mr. Musendo as to the  fact
    that the appellant has exercised deceit and manipulative  behaviour  on
    many occasions  over  several  years  when  assessing  the  information
    provided to him in interview. Such uncritical assessment appears to  me
    to flow through the document which is a  significant  concern  for  the
    Tribunal in respect of a report authored by a professional relying upon
    their independence.



Notice of decision

79. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of a material error on a point of law.

80. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  upheld.  The  appeal  is
    dismissed.
