Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms V Easty, counsel, instructed by Duncan Lewis & Co
solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. On 6th May 2014 Mr Howell (hereafter the claimant) was served  with  a
      decision that S32(5) UK Borders Act 2007 applies. A deportation  order
      was signed on  23rd  April  2014.  On  1st  June  2015  the  appellant
      (hereafter the SSHD) was given permission to appeal.


   2. The grounds upon which the SSHD relies are, in essence, as follows:


   a) That the judge had materially misdirected himself in his assessment of
      what constitutes "unduly harsh" in the context of  the  separation  of
      the child and the claimant
   b) The judge had applied the test  of  whether  it  was  'reasonable'  or
      wholly unreasonable for the claimant's former partner to  relocate  to
      Jamaica, rather than whether it was unduly harsh to expect her  to  do
      so;
   c) That the judge erred in taking account of the lack of offending  since
      release because the lack of offending does  not  diminish  the  public
      interest.


   3. Permission to appeal was granted  on  all  grounds.  In  his  Rule  24
      response, Mr Howells submitted that the grounds were no  more  than  a
      disagreement with the FtT judge's finding  that  it  would  be  unduly
      harsh on the his son if he were deported and that the judge had  given
      adequate reasons for his findings and had applied the correct test. He
      further submitted that the reference to the lack of  medical  evidence
      as to the degree of disability of the child was not  in  issue  before
      the FtT; that there was no error of law in the chronology of care  and
      contact referred to by the judge; that it was not submitted  that  the
      judge failed to take into account a  relevant  consideration  or  took
      into account irrelevant considerations or erred in his  assessment  of
      what was exceptional. Further it was submitted that although the  SSHD
      argued that the judge misapplied the test of unduly harsh  by  stating
      it was not reasonable  or  wholly  unreasonable  for  the  partner  to
      relocate to Jamaica, that amounts to 'unduly harsh'. In any  event  it
      was  submitted  that  the  appeal  was  allowed  under  s117D  of  the
      Nationality  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  where  there  is  no
      requirement to assess whether it would be unduly harsh.




       Background




   4. Mr Howell, a Jamaican  citizen  date  of  birth  22nd  February  1988,
      arrived in the UK as a visitor with leave to enter for 6 months on  11
      December 1999. An application for leave to remain as  a  dependant  of
      his mother was refused on 8 September 2000. He has a  partner  in  the
      UK, Ms Hibberd, who is a British Citizen and they have a son  R,  born
      on 13th August 2005 who has cerebral palsy. The FtT judge  appears  to
      accept that the claimant and Ms Hibberd have been  in  a  relationship
      for some 10 years or more although during that time  there  have  been
      periods when they have not lived together  for  reasons  that  include
      domestic violence. It appears that the FtT judge, at the date  of  the
      hearing accepted that the couple were living together and intended  to
      marry.


   5. Mr Howell has a committed a number of offences:
   a) 11th October 2006 sentenced to  6  months  suspended  for  18  months,
      unpaid work of 100 hours and a curfew with electronic tagging  for  12
      months for two counts of robbery;
   b) 25th October 2006 fined �75 for possession of Class C controlled drug;
   c) 18th May 2007 fined �50 for failing to  surrender  to  custody  at  an
      appointed time
   d) 31st March 2008 sentenced to 3 months and 1 month to run consecutively
      for breach of a suspended sentence, common assault and  destroying  or
      damaging property;
   e) 16th December 2008 fined �50 for destroying or damaging property;
   f) 10th February 2009 6  months  suspended  for  18  months,  supervision
      order, 18 months curfew and 3 months tagging for theft from a person;
   g) 20th May 2009 continue community order with 20 hours unpaid  work  for
      breaching a suspended sentence (10th February 2009);
   h) 26th October 2010 30 months sentence for possession  of  class  A  and
      possession of Class A with intent to supply and 3 months  imprisonment
      unserved  from  original  sentence  of  10th  February  2009,  to  run
      concurrently.


   6. Mr Howell had not committed any offences  since  he  was  released  on
      licence on 24th October 2011.


   7. The child R has  been  diagnosed  with  cerebral  palsy  resulting  in
      weakness on the left side known as hemi paresis. He has  achieved  all
      his motor development milestones within the normal age range  and  has
      walked independently from the age of 13 months.  The  report  from  Mr
      Ricketts (social worker from the Social Services Care division)  dated
      13th July 2013 refers to Mr Howell having


             'good attachments with R...understands  the  impact  [domestic
             violence] could have on his son....R is a happy, confident and
             active boy, he loves his father and enjoys activities they  do
             together. Mr Howell and R were observed  to  have  a  positive
             attachment and Mr Howell is able to positively  interact  with
             his son. He is a good and caring  father  and  is  emotionally
             attached   to   R...no   safeguarding   concerns   have   been
             identified.....It is my opinion that the  separation  in  this
             family  would  be  devastating  the  welfare  of  R   as   the
             psychological effect could induce difficulties in relation  to
             his  education,  health  behaviour   and   self   esteem...the
             deportation of his  father  would  result  in  a  resource  of
             emotional and practical support being taken away from him  and
             this  would  be  to  the  detriment  of   this   young   boy's
             development.'


   8. The relevant Rules and legislation:


             398. Where a person claims that  their  deportation  would  be
             contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the  Human
             Rights Convention, and
             (a) ....;
             (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to
             the public good and in the public interest because  they  have
             been  convicted  of  an  offence  for  which  they  have  been
             sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but
             at least 12 months; or
             (c) ....
              the Secretary of State in assessing that claim will  consider
             whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not, the
             public interest in deportation  will  only  be  outweighed  by
             other factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances
             over and above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A
             .
             399. This paragraph applies where paragraph  398  (b)  or  (c)
             applies if
             -
             (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
             relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is  in
             the UK, and
               (i) the child is a British Citizen; or
               (ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for at  least
               the 7 years immediately preceding the date of the immigration
               decision; and in either case
                   (a) it would be unduly harsh for the child  to  live  in
                   the country to which the person is to be deported; and
                   (b) it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain  in
                   the UK without the person who is to be deported; or
             (b) the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship  with
             a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or settled
             in the UK, and
               (i) the relationship was formed at a  time  when  the  person
               (deportee) was in  the  UK  lawfully  and  their  immigration
               status was not precarious; and
               (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live in the
               country to which the person is to  be  deported,  because  of
               compelling circumstances over and above  those  described  in
               paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and
               (iii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to remain  in
               the UK without the person who is to be deported.


             399A. This paragraph applies where  paragraph  398(b)  or  (c)
             applies if -
             (a) the person has been lawfully resident in the UK  for  most
             of his life; and
             (b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and
             (c)  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles   to   his
             integration into the country to which it  is  proposed  he  is
             deported.




             PART 5A Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
             Article 8 of the ECHR: public interest considerations


             117A Application of this Part


             (1)This Part applies where a court or tribunal is required  to
             determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-
                  (a)breaches a person's right to respect  for  private  and
                  family life under Article 8, and
                  (b)as a result would be unlawful under section  6  of  the
                  Human Rights Act 1998.


             (2)In considering the public interest question, the  court  or
             tribunal must (in particular) have regard-
                  (a)in all cases, to the considerations listed  in  section
             117B, and
                  (b)in  cases  concerning  the   deportation   of   foreign
                  criminals, to the considerations listed in section 117C.


             (3)In subsection (2), "the public interest question" means the
             question of whether an interference with a person's  right  to
             respect for private and family life is justified under Article
             8(2).


             117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in
             all cases


             (1)The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
             public interest.


             (2)It is in the public interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak  English,  because  persons  who  can  speak
             English-


             (a)are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
             (b)are better able to integrate into society.


             (3)It is in the public interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons-


             (a)are not a burden on taxpayers, and
             (b)are better able to integrate into society.


             (4)Little weight should be given to-


             (a)a private life, or
             (b)a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,


             that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.


             (5)Little weight should be given to a private life established
             by a person at a time when the person's immigration status  is
             precarious.


             (6)In the case of a person who is not liable  to  deportation,
             the public interest does  not  require  the  person's  removal
             where-


             (a)the  person  has  a   genuine   and   subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and


             (b)it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
             United Kingdom.


             117C Article 8: additional considerations in  cases  involving
             foreign criminals


             (1)The deportation of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
             interest.
             (2)The  more  serious  the  offence  committed  by  a  foreign
             criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation of
             the criminal.
             (3)In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who  has  not  been
             sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,
             the public interest requires C's deportation unless  Exception
             1 or Exception 2 applies.
             (4)Exception 1 applies where-
                  (a)C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom  for
                  most of C's life,
                  (b)C is socially and culturally integrated in  the  United
             Kingdom, and
                  (c)there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  C's
                  integration into the country to which C is proposed to  be
                  deported.
             (5)Exception 2 applies where C has a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship with a  qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and
             subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child,  and
             the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be
             unduly harsh.
             (6).....
             (7)The considerations in subsections (1)  to  (6)  are  to  be
             taken into account where a court or tribunal is considering  a
             decision to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent  that
             the reason for the decision was the offence  or  offences  for
             which the criminal has been convicted.






       Error of Law


   9. The FtT judge correctly identifies that the  starting  point  in  this
      case is that the deportation of Mr Howell is conducive to  the  public
      good. The decision of  the  FtT  Judge  is  confusing:  he  refers  to
      paragraphs in the Rules that are not  relevant  and,  even  if  it  is
      accepted that these references are no more than typographical  errors,
      he refers to factors in those paragraphs which do not exist.


  10. In so far  as  it  is  possible  to  extract  relevant  findings  from
      paragraphs 106 to 136 he makes the following findings:
   i) The child R is a British Citizen and he has a genuine  and  subsisting
      relationship with the child
          (ii)    it would be unreasonable to expect the child R,  who  was
          born on 13th August 2005, to leave the UK
          (iii)   the primary consideration is  whether  there  is  another
          family member able to care for the child in the UK and there is -
          the child's mother Ms Hibberd.
          (iv)    It would be wholly unreasonable for Ms Hibberd to  remove
          herself to Jamaica - she has no family ties there whatsoever,  no
          accommodation, maintenance or employment to turn to.
          (v) Ms Hibberd is a British Citizen and Mr Howell and Ms  Hibberd
          have a genuine and subsisting relationship
          (vi)    Mr Howell has been lawfully present in  the  UK  from  11
          December 1999 until 8 September 2000 and then from  10th  January
          2005 until 23rd April 2014
          (vii) he does not satisfy paragraph 399A of the Immigration Rules
          (although in the determination this is said to be paragraph 339A,
          Ms Easty submitted and Mr Whitwell accepted that the judge  meant
          399A);  his  immigration  status  was  not  precarious  when   he
          established his relationship as he had  been  granted  indefinite
          leave to  remain  in  2005;  Exception  1  (s117C(4)  Nationality
          Immigration and Asylum Act 2002) is not  met  although  he  meets
          117C(a) and (b) there are not very significant obstacles  to  his
          integration into Jamaica.
          (viii) based upon the expert evidence of Ms Rickets and  my  (the
          judge's) assessment of the needs and welfare of  this  child  set
          out in the written and oral evidence it would be unduly harsh for
          him to be separated from his partner and child.
          (ix) He has committed one extremely serious criminal  offence  in
          2010 but 'all' the indications are that he has shown  significant
          remorse and corrected his offending behaviour
          (x) his removal  would  be  unduly  harsh  bearing  in  mind  the
          significant  detriment  that  would  place  on  his  partner  but
          particularly his nine year old son.
          (xi) he falls within Exception 117C(4) [it seems that this should
          read s117C(5)].
          (xii) the balance 'falls in  favour'  of  Mr  Howell  'given  the
          significant detriment his partner and his child will  suffer  'on
          the back of his removal to Jamaica'.




   11. Although the judge identified what he took into account in  reaching
       his conclusions, he does not address on what basis or why separation
       of the child from his father would be unduly harsh.  The  separation
       of the child from his father may, in these particular  circumstances
       be harsh, but those circumstances do not approach, on  the  findings
       of the FtT  judge,  'unduly  harsh'.  The  social  worker  does  not
       identify anything other than the detriment that would be suffered by
       any child being separated from a father with whom  he  has  a  close
       relationship. The social worker states future development 'could' be
       affected, not that it will or how it will. That a child will  suffer
       is axiomatic but nothing has been identified which could lead  to  a
       conclusion that it is unduly harsh. 'Unduly harsh'  is  an  elevated
       threshold - see MAB (para 399; "unduly harsh") USA [2015] UKUT 00435
       (IAC). The FtT judge has not even come close to identifying what, in
       the circumstances of  this  child  and  the  relationship  with  his
       father, would be unduly harsh - and that is without considering  the
       seriousness of the  offence  committed  by  Mr  Howell  -  see   KMO
       (section 117 - unduly harsh) Nigeria [2015] UKUT 00543(IAC). This is
       not a mere disagreement but a fundamental failure on the part of the
       judge to identify and make findings why  such  separation  would  be
       unduly harsh.


   12. Furthermore although the judge found that it would be  unduly  harsh
       for Mr Howell to be separated from his son that is not the test. The
       test is whether it would be unduly harsh for the  child.  The  judge
       has also failed to address and identify whether and how it would  be
       unduly harsh for the child, if the parents so choose, to  travel  to
       and live in Jamaica.


   13. In so far as the judge finds that it would be 'wholly  unreasonable'
       for Ms Hibberd to relocate to Jamaica this appears to be based on  a
       lack of family, maintenance and accommodation. She would  of  course
       be relocating with her family if she chose to do so  -  her  partner
       and her son. Again the judge has failed to identify  what  would  be
       unduly harsh rather than uncomfortable or challenging.  He  has  not
       made a finding as to whether it would be unduly harsh for Ms Hibberd
       to remain in the UK without Mr Howell. Wholly unreasonable cannot be
       equated with 'unduly harsh' and the judge has  failed  to  make  any
       proper finding on that required element.


   14. The Rule 24 response states that the judge in any event allowed  the
       appeal under s117D where there is no 'unduly harsh' test. S117D does
       not set out  any  test  but  is  a  'definition'  section.  S117C(5)
       requires consideration whether the effect of the deportation  of  an
       individual is unduly harsh on the partner or child. It is  therefore
       difficult to understand on  what  basis  the  Rule  24  response  is
       submitting that the appeal was allowed "in any event". It was not.


   15. I find that the FtT judge erred  in  law  in  his  consideration  of
       'unduly harsh'. I set aside the decision to be remade.


   16. None of the findings stand - the judge had failed to  make  findings
       on the evidence before him in the context of unduly harsh  and  many
       of his findings do not stand up to scrutiny.  In  particular  it  is
       difficult to see how it can be said that his  relationship  with  Ms
       Hibberd was formed when his immigration status  was  not  precarious
       hen the child must have been conceived prior to  him  being  granted
       indefinite leave to remain. There were no findings as to the periods
       of time the couple were actually living together - it  appears  that
       throughout the 10 year long relationship there may  well  have  been
       extended periods of time when they were not together. The extent  to
       which Mr Howell had contact other than on a superficial basis during
       those periods of time has not been evaluated. There does not  appear
       to have been any consideration of the  availability  of  educational
       facilities in Jamaica or the extent to  which  the  child  would  be
       disadvantaged if he and his mother chose to travel to Jamaica to  be
       with Mr Howell.


   17. Where I have set aside  a  decision  of  the  first  tier  tribunal,
       s.12(2) of the TCEA 2007 requires me to remit the case to the  First
       tier with directions or remake it for myself. The nature and  extent
       of fact finding  necessary  is  such  that,  having  regard  to  the
       overriding objective, it is appropriate to remit  the  case  to  the
       First-tier Tribunal to be heard. None of the findings of fact,  such
       as they are, stand.




          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

     I set aside the decision

     I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing.

    Anonymity


    The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)
    of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules  2005  and  no
    request for an order was made. I do not make an order.
