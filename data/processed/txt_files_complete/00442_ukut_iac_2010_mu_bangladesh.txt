For the Respondent:  Mr John Parkinson, Senior Presenting Officer


1. As held in AS (Afghanistan) and NV (Sri  Lanka)  [2010]  EWCA  Civ  1076,
there is no time limit on serving  a  Statement  of  Additional  Grounds  in
response to a 'section 120 notice'.   Thus,  an  appellant  may  accrue  ten
years' lawful leave (including leave extended by  section  3C  of  the  1971
Act) while his appeal is pending.  The Tribunal may then be asked to  decide
whether  the  appellant  qualifies  for  indefinite  leave  under  the  Long
Residence Rule.
2. An application cannot be made under the  Long  Residence  Rule  for  only
limited leave to remain.  Two years' leave may be granted  under  paragraphs
276A1-4, but only to people who have applied for indefinite leave,  and  who
are ineligible for it solely because their knowledge of English or  of  life
in the UK is not good enough.


                          DETERMINATION and REASONS

1.  The appellant, a citizen of Bangladesh, has been living  in  the  United
Kingdom since he arrived here with a student visa on  1  August  2000.   His
initial grant of one year's  leave  to  enter  was  followed  by  successive
grants of leave to remain as a student, taking him up to  31  October  2008.
Just before this leave expired, the appellant applied for further  leave  to
remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study  Work)  Migrant,  but  this  application  was
refused on 20th July 2009 because the appellant had  based  his  eligibility
upon a postgraduate certificate in Business Management which turned  out  to
be false.  As a false document had been submitted, the appellant  fell  foul
of paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration Rules, as well as  not  scoring  the
requisite 75 points under Appendix A.

2.  When his appeal came before Immigration Judge Munonyedi on 15th  January
2010, the appellant explained that he did not take his exams  in  July  2008
because he was sure he would fail.  His father had died in May, and  he  was
unable to concentrate on his studies because of  this  bereavement.   So  he
purchased a false certificate for ï¿½1,500.  He did not want  to  go  back  to
Bangladesh while his wife, who lives with him and their 5-year old son,  was
still studying here.  Her course did not finish until  October  2010,  while
her leave did not expire until February 2011.  He asked for a second  chance
to continue his own studies, and then return to Bangladesh.

3.  Judge Munonyedi dismissed the appeal under the  Immigration  Rules,  and
refused to entertain an Article 8 claim as it had not  been  raised  in  the
Grounds of Appeal, despite the appellant's representative praying in aid  AS
(Afghanistan) & NV (Sri  Lanka)  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  1076.   She  cited  Lady
Justice Arden's  minority  judgment  as  justifying  her  refusal.   In  his
grounds for seeking leave to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal,  the  appellant
claims that he did raise Article 8 both in his original  Grounds  of  Appeal
and in his Witness Statement dated 14  September  2009,  which  is  said  to
constitute a 'Statement of Additional Grounds'  under  section  120  of  the
Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act").

4.  It might perhaps be contended that  Article  8  has  not  been  properly
raised in either of these places.  The Grounds of Appeal say  no  more  than
that the refusal of further leave to remain is "contrary to  the  provisions
of the European Convention on Human Rights Act  (sic)",  while  the  Witness
Statement says no  more  than  that  "I  have  a  private  and  family  life
established in  this  country."   The  term  'Article  8'  is  not  actually
mentioned, and one might expect an Article 8 claim to condescend  to  fuller
particulars.  Be that as it may, if an obvious human rights point arises  in
an appeal, the Tribunal must deal with it, whether the appellant has  raised
it in his grounds of appeal or not.  Leave to appeal was indeed  granted  by
Senior Immigration Judge Macleman, restricted to the Article 8 point.

5.  On 8th July 2010 the appeal was listed before Senior  Immigration  Judge
Martin, and it was contended by Mr Malik, who was now instructed,  that  his
client should be allowed to lodge a  further  section  120  statement,  this
time claiming entitlement to remain  on  the  basis  of  ten  years'  lawful
residence in the United Kingdom.  He had  not  actually  reached  the  tenth
anniversary of his sojourn in the United Kingdom, but he would do  so  on  1
August  2010.   Rather  generously,  it  might  be  thought,  the  case  was
adjourned so  that  the  necessary  statement  might  be  served  and  legal
argument marshalled.  The appeal was re-listed for  9  November,  and  on  2
November the appellant signed a statement with the following preamble:


      "This statement should also  be  treated  as  a  'one-stop'  statement
      pursuant to s.120 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002
      raising an 'additional ground'.

6.  When the adjourned hearing came on  before  me,  Mr  Parkinson  did  not
dispute that Immigration Judge Munonyedi had made a material  error  of  law
by declining to entertain the Article 8 claim, and that, as the decision  on
the appeal would have to be re-made, a statement under section 120 could  be
lodged,  on  the  principle  expounded  by  the  Court  of  Appeal   in   AS
(Afghanistan), raising an additional ground.  But he did  dispute  that  the
appellant could succeed under the 'long residence rule',  paragraphs  276A-D
of HC 395.   While  the  appellant's  continuous  residence  in  the  United
Kingdom had,  he  conceded,  been  lawful  for  the  purposes  of  paragraph
276B(i)(a), in that it was "pursuant to existing leave to enter  or  remain"
as specified by paragraph 276A(b)(i) - which would include the  'statutorily
extended leave' under section 3C of the 1971 Act  which  the  appellant  has
enjoyed since his last  period  of  leave  to  remain  as  a  student  would
otherwise have come to an end - Mr Parkinson relied on the 'public  interest
proviso' at rule 276B(ii).  This makes it possible for indefinite  leave  to
be refused  despite  an  applicant's  having  completed  ten  years'  lawful
residence in the United Kingdom, if this  would  be  undesirable  on  public
interest  grounds.   Such  grounds  include,  at   rule   276B(ii)(c),   the
'character, conduct and associations' of the applicant.  Mr Parkinson  urged
me to find that the appellant's  blatant  use  of  deception  in  trying  to
obtain leave to remain as a Tier 1 Migrant did indeed render it  undesirable
for him to be granted indefinite leave to remain.

7.  Mr Malik thought he had the answer to that.  His client was not  seeking
indefinite leave.  He  was  only  seeking  limited  leave.  Rule  276A2,  he
explained, allows an extension of stay of up to two years to be  granted  if
the applicant  meets  the  requirement  in  paragraph  276A1,  which  is  as
follows:


      "276A1. The requirement to be met by a person seeking an extension  of
      stay on the grounds of long residence in the United  Kingdom  is  that
      the applicant meets all the requirements in paragraph  276B  of  these
      rules, except the requirement to  have  sufficient  knowledge  of  the
      English language and sufficient knowledge about  life  in  the  United
      Kingdom contained in paragraph 276B(iii)."

8.  The stipulation about meeting "all the requirements in  paragraph  276B"
would seem, on the face of it, to include  the  'public  interest  proviso'.
But Mr Malik argued that rule 276B sets out "the requirements to be  met  by
an applicant for indefinite leave", and  his  client  was  only  seeking  an
extension of two years under rule 276A2.

9.  Although Mr Malik prays in aid  the  long-established  proposition  that
the Immigration Rules  are  to  be  construed  sensibly,  according  to  the
natural and ordinary meaning of the words used, that  proposition  does  not
assist his ingenious argument.  The meaning of a word can vary according  to
the company it keeps, and rules  must  be  interpreted  according  to  their
context.  Paragraphs 276A1-4 were introduced into the Immigration  Rules  on
2nd April 2007, at the same time as a new subparagraph (iii)  was  added  to
paragraph 276B.  That subparagraph requires applicants for indefinite  leave
to remain on the grounds of long residence to have sufficient  knowledge  of
the English language and about life in the United Kingdom.   Applicants  who
do not have that knowledge,  but  who  fulfil  the  other  requirements  for
indefinite leave, may instead be granted two years' leave  to  remain  under
the new rules 276A1-4, during which period they may be expected  to  acquire
the necessary knowledge.  Although rule 276A1 refers to  "a  person  seeking
an extension of stay on the ground of long residence", this  does  not  mean
that people can apply for limited leave to remain solely on  the  ground  of
long residence.  Applications under the  Long  Residence  Rules,  paragraphs
276A-D, are for indefinite leave.  Paragraphs 276A1-4 have  been  introduced
as a halfway house, to accommodate applicants who would otherwise  fall  for
refusal because of paragraph  276B(iii).   The  appellant  cannot  therefore
avoid the 'public interest proviso' by  asserting  that  he  only  wants  to
remain in the United Kingdom for two years at the most.

10.  The 'one-stop statement' made by the appellant  on  2nd  November  2010
does not, on its face, seem to contemplate a  limited  stay  in  the  United
Kingdom in any event.  One reads phrases such as these:


      "I have a well-established private  and  family  life  in  the  United
      Kingdom.   To  ask  me  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom  would  be  an
      interference with this  life,  and  my  circumstances  are  such  that
      interference would be disproportionate.  I have spent ten years of  my
      life in this country.  I consider the United Kingdom  as  my  homeland
      ... During my time in the UK, I have integrated  into  life  here.   I
      have my own network of friends whom I consider to be family. ... If  I
      were to be removed from the United  Kingdom,  the  development  of  my
      private and family life would in fact be hindered."

11.  The language of this statement is quite inconsistent with a  desire  to
stay in the United Kingdom for  no  more  than  two  years.   The  appellant
cannot get round the proviso at paragraph 276B(ii) of the  Rules  for  there
to be no reasons why it would be undesirable for him to be given  indefinite
leave.  Mr Malik argues that it is not open to the  Tribunal  to  dismiss  a
claim raised under section 120 on any of the 'general  grounds  of  refusal'
set out at Part 9 of the Immigration Rules.  But I agree with  Mr  Parkinson
that if the Tribunal is to become the primary decision-maker  under  section
120, then it must be able to take account of all the  Immigration  Rules  if
an appellant claims to qualify for leave to remain in a  different  category
from that for which he applied to the Secretary of State.

12.  In any event,  the  discretion  to  refuse  indefinite  leave  on  long
residence grounds is not confined to Part 9 of the  Immigration  Rules,  but
is to be found in the Long Residence Rules themselves.  That  discretion  is
exercisable by the Tribunal if it is the first-instance decision-maker.   In
the present case, I  find  that  the  blatant  deception  practised  by  the
appellant, which triggered a mandatory refusal under  paragraph  322(1A)  of
his application for further leave, justifies refusing  his  application  for
indefinite leave under paragraph 276D.  That the appellant was only able  to
raise the 'Ten-Year Rule' in the first place because his appeal against  the
mandatory refusal took so long to be resolved, is also a circumstance  which
is not irrelevant to the exercise of the discretion under rule 276B.

13.  I turn at  last  to  the  Article  8  point,  the  only  one  on  which
permission to appeal was originally granted.  The appellant's wife,  who  is
also a citizen of Bangladesh, was enrolled  on  a  course  that  would  have
finished by now, but she has chosen to commence another one, for  a  diploma
in IT, ending next July.  Mr Malik argues that the appeal should be  allowed
under Article 8, so that the appellant can stay with his wife  (and  child),
at least until she completes her education.  Otherwise,  his  wife  will  be
faced with the invidious choice of either cutting short  her  education,  or
being separated from her husband.

14.  I do not think that this choice will involve such  hardship  to  either
party as in itself to engage the operation of Article  8.   The  appellant's
wife knew, when she embarked  upon  this  new  course,  that  her  husband's
immigration status was precarious.  If he does have to return to  Bangladesh
without her, the separation will only be for a  few  months.   If  she  cuts
short her IT course instead, there is nothing before me to suggest that  her
career will be seriously affected, or that a  similar  course  will  not  be
available to her in Bangladesh.  This is not a case  where  the  appellant's
wife and child are British or are settled here.  The family  are  only  here
on a temporary basis,  and  their  family  life  will  only  be  interrupted
briefly if the appellant's wife chooses to stay here till next summer.   The
appellant has no doubt acquired a private life during his  ten-year  sojourn
here which will be interfered with if he has to go back to  Bangladesh,  but
he must have regarded his studies as at an end when he applied for leave  to
remain as a Post-Study Work Migrant.  That  avenue  having  been  closed  to
him, it is not  disproportionate  to  expect  him  to  return  to  his  home
country.


DECISION

15. The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules and under Article  8
of the ECHR.
