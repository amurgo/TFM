Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
No anonymity order was made by the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I  find  that  no
particular issues arise on the facts of this case  that  give  rise  to  the
need for a direction. For this reason no anonymity direction is made.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

      1. This is  an  appeal  by  the  Secretary  of  State.   For  ease  of
         reference, I refer below to the parties as they were in the  First-
         Tier Tribunal albeit that the Secretary of State is technically the
         Appellant in this particular appeal.

      2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan.   He  appeals  against  the
         Respondent's decision dated 19 January 2015  refusing  his  Tier  1
         (Entrepreneur) Migrant application and  directing  his  removal  to
         Pakistan.  The basis of the Respondent's refusal was that, for  the
         purposes of paragraph 245DD(h), she was not satisfied that, on  the
         balance of probabilities, the Appellant had  genuinely  established
         himself in business, that he genuinely intended to invest the funds
         claimed in his business and that he had the funds claimed genuinely
         available to him.

      3. The Appellant appealed the Respondent's decision.   In  a  decision
         promulgated   on 25 June 2015 ("the Decision"), First-Tier Tribunal
         Judge  Manyarara  allowed   the   appeal.    The   Respondent   was
         unrepresented at the hearing.  The Appellant did however give  oral
         evidence.  Permission to appeal the Decision was granted by  First-
         Tier Tribunal Judge Andrew on the basis that the Judge  should  not
         have considered additional evidence produced  at  the  hearing  and
         which was not before the Respondent.   The matter comes before  the
         Upper  Tribunal  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier   Tribunal
         Decision involved the making of an error of law.

Submissions

      4. The Respondent's appeal  turns  on  the  proper  interpretation  of
         section 85A Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  ("section
         85A").  Mrs Willocks-Briscoe directed me to  the  evidence  in  the
         bundle which was not before the Respondent and which is relevant to
         the Respondent's appeal against the Decision.  This consists  of  a
         signed  statement  by  the  Appellant's  cousin  attesting  to  the
         transfer of  funds  to  the  Appellant  with  underlying  documents
         [AB/99], a signed statement from the Appellant's  wife  in  similar
         terms [AB/105], an e mail from the Appellant's aunt which refers to
         a transfer to the Appellant from his aunt [AB/107], a number of P60
         tax certificates [AB/63-69] and a certificate  and  statement  from
         Allied Bank in relation to funds held in the third party's  account
         [AB/57-58]. It is worth noting at this point that the transfer from
         the Appellant's aunt is not  one  of  the  transactions  which  the
         Respondent queries since it was not made within the period  of  the
         statement produced (it was made later).  It is also worthy of  note
         that the P60s are  produced  to  show  only  that  the  Appellant's
         previous earnings permitted him to have  some  savings.  The  Judge
         found that the Appellant had the funds genuinely available to  him,
         and relied in part in her reasoning on the  documents  at  [AB/99],
         [AB/105] and [AB/63-69].

      5. Mrs Willocks-Briscoe  submitted  that,  as  a  points-based  system
         application, the Judge was not entitled  to  take  account  of  the
         additional evidence and, if that were excluded,  the  appeal  could
         not have been allowed.  She relied on the case of Ahmed v Secretary
         of State for  the  Home  Department  [2014]  UKUT  00365  (IAC)  as
         authority for the proposition that the issues under challenge still
         relate to a points-based decision even though they are raised under
         the heading  of  "Non-points  scoring  reasons  for  refusal".   In
         response to a question from me, she submitted that the exclusion of
         new evidence in section 85A related as much to oral evidence as  to
         documentary evidence and as such, the Appellant's explanation as to
         the source of the funds in oral evidence and in his  statement  was
         not permitted under Section 85A either.   She  submitted  that  the
         decision in Butt v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
         [2011] UKUT 00353 (IAC) does  not  assist  as  that  case  concerns
         evidence falling within one of the exceptions under Section 85A.

      6. Mr Khalid submitted that the issues raised by the Respondent do not
         relate to the acquisition of points and as such fall within Section
         85A(4)(d).  He accepted that  the  documents  which  Mrs  Willocks-
         Briscoe identified were not before  the  Respondent.   However,  he
         submitted that those provide support only for the Appellant's  case
         relating to the origin  of  the  funds.   He  referred  me  to  the
         application form in relation to the availability of funds and  what
         the Appellant was required to  produce  in  order  to  support  his
         application in that regard.  The Appellant provided  the  specified
         documents.  There was nothing in the  application  form,  Rules  or
         guidance which required him to produce evidence in relation to  the
         source of the funds.  He submitted that it would be contrary to the
         rules of common law fairness to preclude an Appellant from  relying
         on documents which he was not required by the Respondent to produce
         when making the application and could not then  produce  to  answer
         matters taken against him in the decision letter as a result of the
         Respondent's reliance on Section 85A.  The  Respondent  interviewed
         the Appellant prior to making the decision  but  the  copy  of  the
         interview record before the Judge was incomplete and the Respondent
         was not present to be asked for a full copy.  Mr  Khalid  submitted
         that if the full interview record had been  before  the  Judge  the
         outcome would be  the  same.   Mrs  Willocks-Briscoe  was  able  to
         provide me with a full copy of the interview record and I have  had
         regard to that when reaching my decision even  though  it  was  not
         before the Judge.

      7. Mr Khalid submitted that the decision in Ahmed is not determinative
         because the Appellant there withdrew his appeal after the error  of
         law stage.  The decision in that case does not elaborate on the new
         evidence which the Appellant sought to produce.  He submitted  that
         Section 85A could not be intended to preclude  oral  evidence.   On
         that basis, the Appellant was entitled to give evidence to  explain
         the source of the funds and the Judge relied on that in addition to
         the documents.

Decision and reasons

      8. The Judge's reasons for allowing the appeal appear at [15]  -  [23]
         of the Decision.  As noted at [16], the Judge found the Appellant's
         oral evidence very helpful.  The Judge accepted for the reasons set
         out in that paragraph that the Appellant had the funds available to
         him as asserted.  Those funds are �22,000 in his  bank  account  in
         the UK and �28,000 in his father's bank account at Allied  Bank  in
         Pakistan.  As the Judge noted and Mr Khalid  rightly  submits,  the
         Respondent does not take issue with the existence of the  funds  or
         the genuineness of the documents showing those funds.  She does not
         accept that the funds are genuinely available because the amount in
         the NatWest bank account totalling  over  �26,000  was  accumulated
         over the course of a period of a few weeks preceding the  statement
         end date.  Issue is taken with the Allied Bank statement  of  funds
         on the basis that the funds were credited to the account  only  one
         day before the date of the letter.

      9. Although the Respondent raised  concerns  in  the  decision  letter
         about whether the Appellant is a genuine entrepreneur, none of  the
         documents on which the Judge relied in her findings on that  aspect
         amount to new evidence and accordingly the Judge  was  entitled  to
         her finding at [19] for the reasons set out in that  paragraph  and
         at [20] to [21] that  the  Appellant  is  a  genuine  entrepreneur,
         having heard him give evidence. Mrs Willocks-Briscoe's  submissions
         were therefore restricted to the genuineness of the availability of
         funds.

     10. Having now had sight of the interview record, the  issue  regarding
         the genuine availability of funds is dealt with at  questions  [25]
         to [28].  In short summary, the Appellant said that the �22,000 was
         his personal savings and the �28,000 in Allied Bank was funds  held
         by his father and was a gift from his father.  He was not asked why
         he said that the �22,000 was savings when it had only recently been
         paid in to the account.  He was not asked why  the  credit  to  his
         father's account was so recent or whether the money remained in the
         account.  In his statement, the Appellant confirms the  answers  he
         gave at interview.  He goes on to say that the amount of  money  in
         the UK is personal savings but that recent deposits were  from  his
         wife and cousin to whom he had loaned money and that  his  aunt  in
         America had sent him some money.  As such, with  the  exception  of
         the money received from his aunt, that is not inconsistent with his
         answer that the money came from his savings but that those  savings
         were used in the past to loan money to his wife and a relative  who
         paid him back when he needed the money for his application.

     11. The documents submitted by way of new evidence merely  confirm  his
         account.   In the case of the money held in the  UK,  they  confirm
         the source  of  the  payments  in  from  those  who  had  made  the
         transfers.  In the case of the money in Pakistan, they confirm that
         various credits and debits were made over a period of  four  months
         but  that  the  underlying  balance  was  maintained  at  the  same
         approximate level.  In circumstances where the Respondent  did  not
         identify  any  inconsistency  about  the  Appellant's  answers   at
         interview or seek clarification of his answers at that  stage,  the
         Appellant was clearly entitled to provide that clarification in his
         oral evidence.  That  did  not  amount  to  new  evidence  for  the
         purposes of section 85A.

     12. I accept that the new documentary evidence as referred  to  at  [4]
         above does not fall within any of the exceptions  to  section  85A.
         Although the documents were submitted to  answer  the  Respondent's
         case in relation to the genuineness of the source of the funds, and
         although that case is put under a heading  of  non-points  scoring,
         that is not decisive and, for the reasons set  out  in  Ahmed,  the
         genuineness of the  application  forms  part  of  the  Respondent's
         assessment whether points  should  be  awarded  and  therefore  the
         documents relate to the acquisition of points.  I accept also  that
         some of the Judge's reasoning for accepting the genuineness of  the
         availability of those funds at [16] is based  on  those  documents.
         However, it is clear from [16] read as a whole that,  even  without
         the documents, and based on the Appellant's statement and his  oral
         evidence, the Judge was entitled to be satisfied that  those  funds
         were genuinely available based on the Appellant's explanation.  The
         issue of whether the  Appellant's  explanation  is  credible  is  a
         matter for the Judge to assess.  Of course, if the  Respondent  had
         been represented, she could have tested his explanation  in  cross-
         examination but the Appellant should not now be prejudiced  by  the
         Respondent's failure to provide representation at the hearing. As I
         note at [4] above, the funds from the Appellant's aunt were not one
         of the transactions which formed part of the balance in the account
         at the statement end date in any event.  Further, when dealing with
         the money held in Pakistan, the Judge's findings are based  in  the
         main on the documents which  were  before  the  Respondent  ie  the
         Appellant's father's declaration and identity card.

     13. I am therefore satisfied that, even if the Judge did make an  error
         of law by taking into account the additional documents,  the  error
         was not material.  The Judge would have reached the  same  decision
         on the basis of the documents before the Respondent as clarified by
         the Appellant in oral evidence. I am therefore not  satisfied  that
         the First-Tier Tribunal Decision involved the making of a  material
         error of law and I uphold the Decision.

DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision did not involve the making  of  a  material
error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision
