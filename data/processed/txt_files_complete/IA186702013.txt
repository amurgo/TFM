                          Determination and Reasons

Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr S Bellara, Counsel
For the  Respondent:     Ms  R  Pettersen,  Senior  Home  Office  Presenting
                       Officer

Background

   1.       This appeal comes before me following the grant of permission to
      the respondent by First-tier Tribunal Judge Chohan in respect  of  the
      determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge M A Khan  who  allowed  the
      appeal by way of a determination dated 30 December 2013.  Although the
      Secretary of State is the party challenging the determination, I have,
      for the sake  of  convenience,  continued  to  refer  to  her  as  the
      respondent and to the applicant as the appellant.

   2.       The appellant is a citizen of China born on  14  December  1986.
      She appeals the respondent's decision to refuse to issue  her  with  a
      derivative residence card under Regulations 15A(4A), 15A(7),  18A  and
      21(A) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006. She  has  a  daughter
      born on 26 January 2012 who is a British national on  account  of  the
      fact that the child's father is British. The appellant admits to  have
      deliberately set out to become pregnant by a British citizen so as  to
      better her chances of remaining in the  UK.  The  child's  father  has
      acknowledged paternity and financially supports her. In June 2012  the
      appellant was convicted of prostitution. She received an  eight  month
      sentence and has ï¿½55,000 confiscated.

   3.       The application was  refused  because  the  respondent  was  not
      satisfied that the appellant had shown that her child would be  unable
      to remain in the UK without her and because it was  not  conducive  to
      the public good to issue a residence card in view of her criminality.

   4.       The judge found that other than  providing  financial  help  and
      occasionally visiting her, Mr Wild played no role in the child's life.
      He found that the child was wholly dependent upon her mother and  that
      the requirements of Regulation 15A had been met. He found that if  the
      appellant were removed, the child would  be  taken  into  care  or  be
      adopted and that her best interests were therefore served in remaining
      with the appellant. Accordingly, he allowed the appeal  on  Article  8
      grounds as well.

Appeal hearing

   5.       At the  hearing  I  heard  submissions  from  the  parties.   Ms
      Pettersen took issue with the judge's findings on the  involvement  of
      the father in her upbringing and the conclusion  that's  he  would  be
      adopted or taken into care if the appellant were to  be  removed.  She
      pointed out that there  was  a  conflict  between  the  Memorandum  of
      Understanding signed  between  the  appellant  and  Mr  Wild  and  the
      appellant's oral evidence, that  there  was  nothing  to  support  his
      conclusions about the child's fate, that  no  removal  directions  had
      been set for the appellant and that all these failings had resulted in
      an unsustainable decision.

   6.       Mr Bellara submitted  that  the  judge  did  not  even  need  to
      consider Article 8 if he allowed the appeal under the Regulations.  He
      submitted that part of the determination was sustainable. A summary of
      the evidence had been provided and reasons were given for his findings
      under the Regulations. The determination should not be disturbed.
   7.       Ms Pettersen responded. She submitted that the conflict over  Mr
      Wild's role had not been resolved given the appellant's  own  evidence
      that Mr Wild played a significant role in financially  supporting  the
      child and regularly visited her.

   8.       At the conclusion of the hearing  I  reserved  my  determination
      which I now give.

Findings and Conclusions

   9.        I  have  taken  into  account  the  submissions  made  and  the
      determination   of   the   First-tier   Tribunal.   Regrettably,   the
      determination is littered with typographical, spelling and grammatical
      errors which does not inspire  confidence.  That  could,  however,  be
      overlooked if the substance and reasoning were sound.

  10.       A primary carer of an EEA national  child  will  qualify  for  a
      derivative right of residence under regulation 15A(4) if the following
      conditions are met:

      (a) the applicant is the primary carer of an EEA national and

      (b) the relevant EEA national
           (i) is under the age of 18;
           (ii) is residing in the UK as a self-sufficient person; and
           (iii) would be unable to remain in the UK if their primary carer
           were required to leave the UK.

11.   The evidence before  the  judge  was  that  despite  a  Memorandum  of
      Understanding in which Mr Wild disclaimed parental responsibility  for
      the child,  he  nevertheless  provided  all  the  necessary  financial
      support, paid the rent and visited her regularly. He has  a  ten  year
      old son who lives with him for whom he has responsibility, the child's
      mother being overseas. The appellant claimed that Mr  Wild  would  not
      take care of the child on a permanent basis and it was on  this  basis
      that the appeal was essentially allowed but,  as  the  respondent  has
      pointed out, no reasons are given for why the judge accepted the  oral
      evidence of the appellant given her criminal record and the fact  that
      she appears to have tricked Mr Wild and conceived the child so  as  to
      enhance her own chances to remain here. Certainly, the  evidence  does
      not support the finding that the appellant is the sole  carer  of  the
      child and whilst she might  satisfy  the  Tribunal  that  she  is  the
      child's primary carer,  the  judge  has  failed  to  provide  adequate
      reasons for his finding that the requirements of sub section  (b)(iii)
      have been met.

12.   For these reason, I find that  the  judge  did  not  provide  adequate
      reasons for his conclusions under the Regulations. It follows that his
      Article 8 conclusions cannot stand as  they  are  based  on  the  same
      flawed premise. However, that aside,  it  has  to  be  said  that  the
      judge's assessment is wholly inadequate and  incomplete;  no  findings
      have been made following the setting out of the Razgar steps  and  the
      questions listed at paragraph 36 are unanswered.

13.   The determination is set aside and the appeal is remitted  to  another
      First-tier Tribunal Judge for re-hearing on all issues.

Decision

14    The First-tier Tribunal Judge made errors of  law.  His  determination
      is set aside in its entirety. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier
      Tribunal for hearing afresh by another judge.
