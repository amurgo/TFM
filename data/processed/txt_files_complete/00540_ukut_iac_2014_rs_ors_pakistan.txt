Representation:

Appellant:   Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.
Respondents:  Mr A Hussain of Legal and Legal Solicitors


   1) Paragraph [D] of Appendix FM-SE is an example, within the  context  of
      the requirement  to  supply  specified  evidence,  of  the  increasing
      influence of discretionary powers of waiver and further enquiry in the
      Immigration Rules.

   2)  Where applicants wish to invoke any discretion  of  this  kind,  they
      should do so when making the relevant  application,  highlighting  the
      specific provision of the Rules invoked and the grounds upon which the
      exercise of discretion is requested.


   3) Where  any  request  of  this  kind  is  made  and  refused,  a  brief
      explanation should be provided by the decision maker.

   4) A refusal to exercise a discretionary power as described in (1)  above
      may render an immigration decision not in  accordance  with  the  law,
      under section 84(1)(e) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
      2002.

   5) Powers of waiver are dispensing provisions, designed  to  ensure  that
      applications suffering from certain minor defects or omissions can  be
      readily remedied.

   6)  The  hierarchical  distinction  between  the  Immigration  Rules  and
      Immigration Directorate Instructions ("IDIs") must be observed at  all
      times.

   7) A failure to recognise, or give  effect  to,  an  IDI  may  render  an
      immigration decision not in accordance with the law.



                                DETERMINATION

Introduction

 1. The  Appellant  herein  is  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (Islamabad,
    Pakistan) whom we shall describe as the  "ECO"  for  convenience.   The
    Respondents are four members of the same family consisting  of  mother,
    two sons (aged 12 and 9 years respectively) and a  daughter  (aged  7),
    all nationals of Pakistan.  The fifth person in  the  equation  is  the
    sponsor, who is  described  in  the  visa  applications  as  the  first
    Respondent's husband. It is not disputed that the sponsor is settled in
    the United Kingdom. The three children, according to the  applications,
    were born to the mother (the first Respondent) when she was married  to
    another person from whom she is now divorced.

The ECO'S Decisions

 2. These appeals have their origins in a series of decisions  of  the  ECO
    whereby the Respondents' applications  for  visas  permitting  them  to
    enter the United Kingdom were refused.  The applications were  made  on
    28 November 2012 and the refusal decisions are dated 27 February  2013.
     In the applications, the sponsor  is  described  as  a  self  employed
    person  engaged  in  "takeaway"  and  decorating  businesses.   It  was
    represented that in the last full financial year his gross  income  was
    �29,321.  It was stated that the sponsor is not financially responsible
    for any other person. In the childrens' applications,  the  sponsor  is
    described as their "step father married to my mother".

 3. The ECO's four refusal decisions are couched in identical  terms.   The
    decisions refer to paragraph EC-C.1.1 of Appendix FM of the Immigration
    Rules.  The reasons for the refusals are  expressed  in  the  following
    passage:

         "You submit documents showing that your sponsor  is  self  employed
         trading as [takeaway] and [decorator].  Therefore you are  required
         to submit specified documents in relation to both  businesses.   In
         regard to [the takeaway] you have not provided  the  latest  annual
         self assessment tax return to HMRC and Statement of Account  (SA300
         or SA302), original proof of  registration  or  certified  copy  of
         documentation  issued  by  HMRC  only,  your  sponsors  unique  tax
         reference number, 12 months business bank statements .....


         In regard to [the decorating business] you do not submit the latest
         annual self assessment tax return to HMRC and Statement of  Account
         (SA300 or  (SA302),  original  proof  of  registration  as  a  self
         employed person issued by HMRC  only,  your  sponsor's  unique  tax
         reference number, any business bank statements".


    As regards both businesses, it is stated in the  decisions  that  while
    bank statements were provided with  the  applications,  they  were  not
    compliant with the relevant requirements.  The decisions conclude  with
    the following expression of the omnibus refusal reason:


         "You have  failed  to  provide  the  specified  documents  of  your
         sponsor's employment. I therefore  refuse  your  application  under
         paragraph EC-C.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules  (E-
         ECC.2.1)."

     The decisions also purported to  apply  the  balance  of  probabilities
standard.

Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 4. In their grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (the "FtT"),  the
    Respondents contended:

         "It is submitted that the financial requirements are being  met  by
         the [Respondents'] sponsor  under  5.3.6  of  Appendix  FM  of  the
         Immigration Rules.  The sponsor is self employed  with  accumulated
         gross earnings of �29,321 (as can be noted  from  the  annual  self
         assessment tax return).  As  there  are  three  dependent  children
         applying alongside the main applicant, the  financial  requirements
         placed upon the sponsor is noted  as  requiring  a  minimum  annual
         gross income of  �27,200.   It  is  submitted  that  the  financial
         requirement placed upon the sponsor is being duly satisfied ....


         The ECO noted ...... [that  the  sponsor]  ......  is  required  to
         submit  additional  documentary  evidence  with  regards  to   both
         business.  A number of documents  are  being  forwarded  clarifying
         matters with regards to both businesses ....."


         [Emphasis added.]

    Continuing, it is stated in the grounds of appeal that, in  respect  of
    the sponsor's takeaway business, the following additional documents are
    enclosed:


      a) The latest self assessment tax return.


      b) "Statement of Account".

      c) Proof of registration issued by HMRC.

      d) The sponsor's unique tax reference number.

      e) The sponsor's bank statements spanning the period 17  January  2012
         to 20 February 2013, with the exception of those relating  to  June
         and July 2012 when (it is asserted) the sponsor  was  visiting  the
         Respondents in Pakistan.

 5. As regards the decorating business, the following additional  documents
    were enclosed with the grounds of appeal:


       i) The latest self-assessment tax return.


      ii) "Statement of Accounts".

     iii) The sponsor's personal bank statements in respect of  the  period
          01 November 2011 to date.

    The grounds of appeal also stated:


         "There is no business bank account for [the decorator]  simply  due
         to the nature of this business being fully cash operated."

     The grounds conclude with the following sentence:

         "In overview, it can be seen contrary to the findings  of  the  ECO
         the sponsor has gross earnings in the region of �29,321 being above
         the required amount of �27,200 as noted under Appendix FM."

 6. The  FtT  allowed  the  Respondents'  appeals.   On  the  face  of  the
    determination, the  evidence  considered  by  the  Judge  included  the
    Respondents' bundle of evidence, a chronology of  events,  a  RBS  bank
    statement produced at the hearing, a witness statement of  the  sponsor
    and the sponsor's oral evidence.  In allowing the  appeals,  the  Judge
    reasoned as follows, in [12]:

         "The only matter that was put to the sponsor in  cross  examination
         was that his payments into his personal account did not  match  his
         claimed earnings.  The sponsor explained that this was  because  he
         was paid cash.  This is not an uncommon situation in the  sponsor's
         areas  of  chosen  endeavour.   It  simply  means  that  the  other
         documents provided have to be  considered  with  greater  security.
         The sponsor has produced a considerable amount of documentation  to
         show that he is trading including, inter alia, management  accounts
         and a letter from the HMRC updating outstanding  amounts  dated  13
         March 2013."

    In the next sentence, without further ado, the Judge  stated  that  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules was allowed.

 7. Permission to appeal was sought on the following grounds:

     a) The FtT had  failed  to  give  effect  to  the  specified  evidence
        requirements enshrined in Appendix FM-SE.


     b) The relevant period was the twelve months preceding  November  2012
        and the FtT had  failed  to  address  the  evidential  requirements
        pertaining to this period.

     c) As a result, there was no clear evidence of  the  sponsor's  actual
        gross annual income at the time when  the  visa  applications  were
        made.

    Permission to appeal was granted in the following terms:


         "The  determination  does  not  engage  with  Appendix  FM  of  the
         Immigration Rules, by reference to which the decision was made, nor
         with  Appendix  FM-SE  addressing  the  specified   categories   of
         evidence. These cannot be ignored simply because the sponsor  works
         in a business which  traditionally  deals  by  cash.   This  is  an
         arguable error of law."


Appeal to this Tribunal

 8. The appeal was listed on 02 September 2014.  Regrettably,  it  did  not
    progress far, essentially by reason of the unmanageable  state  of  the
    documentary  evidence.   Appropriate  directions  were  given  and  the
    hearing was adjourned.

 9. In compliance with our directions, and with admirable  expedition,  the
    Respondents' solicitors have  now  provided  the  following  additional
    materials:

    (a)  a written submission,


    (b)  two "additional pieces of evidence", consisting of a  letter  from
         the sponsor's business accountants  dated  16  September  2014  and
         "copy of daily book receipts given by the sponsor to his  customers
         (relating to his business [as] a decorator"; and

     (c) a more coherent bundle of evidence.

    Also attached  were  certain  excerpts  from  Appendix  FM-SE  and  the
    Immigration Directorate Instructions.

10.  In further compliance  with  our  directions,  we  received  a  written
    rejoinder from Mr Matthews on behalf of the ECO.  In brief compass,  it
    was submitted that, having regard to all the evidence, the requirements
    of Appendix FM -  SE  were  plainly  not  satisfied  (first  ground  of
    appeal).  It was argued that the  requirements  relating  to  specified
    documents  are  mandatory  and  they  have  not  been  observed.   This
    submission further drew attention to the period under scrutiny viz  the
    financial year April 2011 to April 2012 (second ground of appeal).   In
    summary, it was submitted that the decision of the FtT is unsustainable
    because the visa applications were non-compliant with the Rules as they
    did not provide the obligatory documentary evidence and,  further,  did
    not satisfy the requirement as to period.

11.  In our directions, we  also  made  provision  for  both  parties,  when
    lodging their  further  submissions,  to  indicate  whether  they  were
    desirous of a further hearing being  convened.   Each  party  intimated
    that a further hearing was not being sought.  While we had reserved  to
    ourselves the final decision on this discrete issue, we were satisfied,
    having regard to the illumination provided by the parties' responses to
    our  directions,  that  the  appeals  could  be  fairly  and   properly
    determined without a further hearing.

12.   As  appears  from  the  foregoing,  the  Respondents   have   provided
    documentary evidence at three distinct stages:  when  submitting  their
    visa applications, on appeal to the FtT and, finally, on appeal to this
    Tribunal.  They were entitled to do so to  the  extent  that  this  was
    permitted by section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002, these being out of  country  appeals.   Accordingly,  insofar  as
    permissible, we have considered  the additional evidence.

Appendix FM - SE Of The Immigration Rules

13.  At this juncture, it is appropriate to rehearse the main provisions  of
    Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration  Rules.   Under  the  rubric  "Family
    Members - Specified Evidence", the opening paragraph states:

         "This Appendix sets out the specified evidence applicants  need  to
         provide to meet the requirements of rules contained in Appendix  FM
         and, where those requirements are also contained in other rules and
         unless otherwise stated, the specified evidence applicants need  to
         provide to meet the requirements of those rules."

         The text continues in (D):

         "In deciding an application in  relation  to  which  this  Appendix
         states  that  specified  documents  must  be  provided,  the  Entry
         Clearance Officer ....  will  consider  documents  that  have  been
         submitted with the application and  will  only  consider  documents
         submitted after the application  where  sub-paragraph  (b)  or  (e)
         applies."

    What follows is immaterial in the context of these appeals,  since,  as
    the r�sum� above demonstrates, the ECO neither considered nor was asked
    to consider any documents  over  and  above  those  provided  with  the
    Respondents' applications.


14.  The Appendix continues, in paragraph (A1):

         "To meet the financial requirement ...  the applicant must meet:


          a)  The  level  of  financial  requirement  applicable   to   the
             application under Appendix FM; and


          b) The requirements specified in Appendix FM and this Appendix as
             to:

             (i)  the permitted sources of income and savings;


             (ii) the time periods and permitted  combinations  of  sources
                  applicable to each permitted source relied upon; and


             (iii)     the evidence  required  for  each  permitted  source
             relied upon."

    Notwithstanding the infelicitous syntax  and  structure  of  the  above
    passage, its thrust is tolerably clear: every  applicant  must  satisfy
    the applicable requirements of Appendix FM and this  further  Appendix,
    including those pertaining to the stipulated documentary evidence.  The
    provisions which follow prescribe a series of "financial requirements".
     In the context of these appeals, the key provisions are  contained  in
    paragraph [7]:


         "In respect of self-employment in the UK as a partner,  as  a  sole
         trader or in a franchise all of the following must be provided:


          a) evidence of the amount of tax payable, paid and unpaid for  the
             last financial year.


          b) the latest:

             (i)   annual self-assessment tax return  to  HMRC  (a  copy  or
             print - out);

     (ii)     statement of Account (SA300 or SA302); and

             (iii) the same for the previous financial year  if  the  latest
                  return does not show the necessary level of gross  income,
                  but the average of the last two financial years does.

          c) proof of registration with HMRC as self-employed if available.


          d) each partner's Unique Tax Reference Number (UTR) and/or the UTR
             of the partnership or business.

          e) where the  person  holds  or  held  a  separate  business  bank
             account, bank statements for the same 12 month  period  as  the
             tax return.

          f) personal bank statements for the same 12 month  period  as  the
             tax return showing that the  income  from  self-employment  has
             been paid into an account in the name of the person or  in  the
             name of the person and their partner jointly.

          g) evidence of ongoing self-employment through ..... [one  of  the
             specified documentary sources]."

    The passages reproduced above are drawn from the version of Appendix FM-
    SE which applied to the Respondents' applications.


Consideration and Conclusions


15.  We turn to consider the written submission of Mr Hussain on  behalf  of
    the Respondents, from which we distil the following main contentions:

    (i)  The appeals centre on  the  business  and  personal  bank  account
         evidential requirements in paragraph 7(e) and (f) of the Appendix.


    (ii)  The  personal  (RBS)  bank  statements  of  the   sponsor   span,
         continuously, the period 01 January 2011 to 01 January 2014.

         (iii)    The sponsor's "takeaway" business  bank  statements  (BOS)
relate to the period            17 January 2012 to 20 December 2013.

    (iv) There is also a statement from the sponsor's savings account (RBS)
         in respect of the period 22  December  2011  to  12  November  2012
         evidencing a credit balance of �6,650.02 on the latter date.

    (v)  As regards the takeaway business,  the  business  bank  statements
         requirement of paragraph 7(e) of the Appendix has been satisfied.


    (vi) As regards the decorating business, as this is "....  based  on  a
         cash basis it is not  feasible  or  practically  possible  for  the
         requirement of paragraph 7(f) to be met ...  The IJ in his decision
         took a practical and realistic approach ...  to come to the correct
         conclusion of allowing the appeal ..."

         It is apparent that the author intended to refer to paragraph 7(e),
         rather than paragraph 7(f), in this passage.

    (vii)    "Evidential Flexibility"  should  have  been  applied  to  the
         applications:  see  paragraph  [D](d)  of  the  Appendix  and   the
         Immigration Directorate Instructions of July 2014, paragraph 3.4.


16.  In view of  this  latter  submission  we  reproduce  at  this  juncture
    paragraph [D] of  Appendix FM -SE:

           "[D](a)    In deciding an application in relation to which  this
                  Appendix states that specified documents must be provided,
                  the ..... decision maker will consider documents that have
                  been submitted with the application and will only consider
                  documents   submitted   after   the   application    where
                  subparagraph (b) or (e) applies.


              (b) If the applicant -


                  (i)  has submitted:


                      (aa)  a  sequence  of  documents  and  some  of   the
                           documents in the sequence have been  omitted  (eg
                           if one bank statement from a series is missing);


                      (bb) a document in the wrong format (for example,  if
                           a  letter  is  not  on  letter  head   paper   as
                           specified); or


                       ac) a document that is a copy  and  not  an  original
                           document; or


                       ad) a document which does  not  contain  all  of  the
                           specified information; or

                   ii) has not submitted a specified document,

                  the decision  maker  may  contact  the  applicant  or  his
                  representative, in writing or otherwise, and  request  the
                  document(s) or the  corrected  version(s).   The  material
                  requested must be received at the address specified in the
                  request within a reasonable time scale  specified  in  the
                  request.

             (c)  The decision maker will not request documents where he or
                  she does not  anticipate  that  addressing  the  error  or
                  omission referred to in (b) will lead to a  grant  because
                  the applicant will be refused for other reasons.


             d) If the applicant has submitted:


                (i)    a document in the wrong format; or


                (ii)   a document that  is  a  copy  and  not  an  original
            document,


                the application may be granted exceptionally, provided  the
                decision maker is satisfied that the  document  is  genuine
                and that the applicant meets the requirements to which  the
                document relates.  The decision maker reserves the right to
                request the certified  original  document  in  the  correct
                format in  all  cases  where  (b)  applies  and  to  refuse
                applications if this material is not provided as set out in
                (b)."

     For completeness, paragraph [D](e) further provides:


         "Where the decision maker is satisfied that there is a valid reason
         why a specified document cannot be supplied eg because  it  is  not
         issued in a particular country or has been permanently lost, he  or
         she may exercise discretion not to apply the  requirement  for  the
         document or to request alternative  or  additional  information  or
         document(s) be submitted by the applicant."

    As the outline above indicates, the Respondents do  not  rely  on  this
    discrete provision of the Appendix. We have reproduced above  paragraph
    [D] of Appendix FM-SE in its entirety because it must be considered  as
    a composite unit.

17.  Mr Hussain's written  submission  on  behalf  of  the  Respondents  has
    crystallised the issues  in  this  appeal  in  a  helpful  way,  thereby
    fulfilling the aim of the adjourned hearing on  02  September  2014  and
    directions given. It is susceptible to the following analysis:

     a) It does not address at all the requirement to  provide  the  latest
        annual self-assessment tax return to HMRC.


     b) Ditto the requirement to provide a "Statement of Account (SA300  or
        SA302)".


     c) Ditto the requirement to provide "Proof of registration  with  HMRC
        as self-employed if available".


     d)  Ditto  the  requirement  to  provide  the  sponsor's  "Unique  Tax
        Reference Number".


     e) It acknowledges, implicitly, that the bank statements in respect of
        the takeaway business submitted with the visa applications were non-
        compliant with paragraph [7](e) of Appendix FM-SE.


     f) It acknowledges that,  as  regards  the  decorating  business,  the
        applications do not comply with paragraph [7](f) of the Appendix.

18.  As a result, there is no challenge by the Respondents  to  the  refusal
    reasons bearing on (a) - (f) in [17] above.  Furthermore, there  is  no
    challenge  to  the  mandatory  nature  of   these   requirements.   The
    Respondents pray in aid  the  "Evidential  Flexibility"  provisions  in
    Appendix FM-SE.   However,  as  demonstrated  above,  these  provisions
    confer a discretion on the ECO confined to cases where  the  applicants
    have submitted a document in the wrong format or a copy document rather
    than an original.  They are far removed from the  present  case,  where
    the infirmities in  the  Respondents'  applications  arise  out  of  an
    outright failure to provide myriad mandatory documents.  Thus there  is
    no basis  for  concluding  that  the  ECO's  failure  to  exercise  the
    discretion available to him was not in accordance with the law.  It  is
    appropriate to  add  that  the  discretion  in  question  is  conferred
    exclusively on the ECO and is not exercisable by either the FtT or this
    Tribunal on appeal.

19.  To summarise,  the  Respondents'  visa  applications  suffered  from  a
    series of systemic, incurable deficiencies in meeting the  requirements
    of the Rules. The additional evidence relied on before the FtT and this
    Tribunal, to the extent that this can be permissibly  considered,   has
    not rectified  these  wholesale  shortcomings.  It  follows   that  the
    decision of the FtT is unsustainable in law.

Discretionary Powers of Waiver and Further Enquiry: General

20.   We  add  the  following  by  way  of  general  guidance.   When   visa
    applications of this kind are  being  compiled,  applicants  and  their
    advisers must obviously be alert to  the  totality  of  the  applicable
    requirements enshrined in Appendix FM-SE.   Alertness  to  the  various
    obligatory  requirements  is  obviously  essential.   We   would   also
    encourage applicants and their advisers who consider that  any  of  the
    discretionary powers conferred on the ECO by paragraph  [D]  should  be
    exercised in their favour to proactively make this case when submitting
    their applications. It  would  be  highly  desirable  to  draw  to  the
    attention of the ECO the specific provision/s of paragraph [D]  invoked
    in support of a request to exercise discretion and to set out fully the
    grounds of  such  request.   We  confine  ourselves  to  one  pertinent
    illustration, arising out of the factual matrix of these  appeals.   If
    this sponsor genuinely cannot provide the necessary records  concerning
    his decorating business, as it is a purely cash enterprise, he  should,
    in any fresh application, specifically invoke paragraph [D](e)  of  the
    Appendix and make his case accordingly, advancing all  relevant  facts,
    justifications and explanations.  Issues of this kind belong firmly  to
    the domain of the primary decision maker and should  not  be  belatedly
    ventilated at the stage of either first  instance  or  second  instance
    appeal.  Adherence to this exhortation and adoption  of  this  practice
    will enhance the quality of  ECO  decision  making,  with  the  logical
    consequences of a reduction in  appeals,  greater  overall  expedition,
    reduced delay and a saving in professional costs.  Furthermore, in  the
    event of an invitation to exercise discretion being refused, one  would
    expect a brief explanation to be given. For the avoidance of doubt,  we
    take this opportunity  to  emphasise  that  an  adequate,  intelligible
    explanation for any discrete refusal of  this  kind  should  always  be
    provided by the ECO.  In  this  way,  the  prospects  of  the  tribunal
    understanding  the  ECO's  reasoning  and,   thereby,   conducting   an
    efficacious and  informed  review  of  the  legality  of  the  impugned
    decision will be greatly enhanced.

21.  Discretionary powers of waiver and further  enquiry  are  conferred  on
    decision  makers  by  other  provisions  of  the   Immigration   Rules.
    Experience demonstrates that these are becoming increasingly  prominent
    and topical. The Immigration Rules, in their current  incarnation,  now
    contain, in paragraph 245AA, something of an omnibus provision relating
    to powers of discretionary further enquiry and discretionary waiver  of
    specified requirements.  Paragraph 245AA  provides,  under  the  rubric
    "Documents Not Submitted With Applications":

     "(a)         Where Part 6A or any appendices referred  to  in  Part  6A
                  state that specified documents must be provided, the Entry
                  Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of
                  State  will  only  consider  documents  that   have   been
                  submitted with the application,  and  will  only  consider
                  documents submitted after the application where  they  are
                  submitted in accordance with subparagraph (b).

           (b)     If the applicant has submitted  specified  documents  in
                 which:

                    i)      Some of the documents in a  sequence  have  been
                       omitted (for example, if one bank  statement  from  a
                       series is missing);


                   ii)      A document is in the wrong format (for  example,
                       if a letter is not on letterhead paper as specified);
                       or


                 (iii) A document is a copy and not an original document; or




                 (iv)  A document does not  contain  all  of  the  specified
                       information;


                 the Entry Clearance Officer,  Immigration  Officer  or  the
                 Secretary  of  State  may  contact  the  applicant  or  his
                 representative  in  writing,  and   request   the   correct
                 documents. The requested documents must be received at  the
                 address specified in the request within 7 working  days  of
                 the date of the request.


           (c)     Documents  will  not  be  requested  where  a  specified
                 document has not been submitted  (for  example  an  English
                 language  certificate  is  missing),  or  where  the  Entry
                 Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary  of
                 State does not anticipate that addressing the  omission  or
                 error referred to in subparagraph (b) will lead to a  grant
                 because the application will be refused for other reasons.


           (d)     If the applicant has submitted a specified document:


                 (i)    in the wrong format; or


                 (ii)   which is a copy and not an original document; or


                 (iii)   which  does  not  contain  all  of  the   specified
                      information,   but   the   missing   information   is
                      verifiable from:

                       (1)   other documents submitted with the application,




                       (2)   the website of the  organisation  which  issued
                       the document, or


                       (3)   the website of the appropriate regulatory body;



           the application may  be  granted  exceptionally,  providing  the
           Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of
           State is satisfied that the specified documents are genuine  and
           the applicant  meets  all  the  other  requirements.  The  Entry
           Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of State
           reserves the right to request the specified  original  documents
           in the correct format in all cases where  (b)  applies,  and  to
           refuse applications if these documents are not provided  as  set
           out in (b).


      As  appears  from  the  opening  words,  paragraph  245AA  applies  to
    applications made  under  Part  6A  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   This
    discrete regime within the Rules regulates  the  "Points-based"  system
    and is concerned  with  various  categories  of  migrants  -  including
    general, highly skilled, entrepreneur, investor  and  post-study  work.
    Part 6A and the Appendices which it incorporates prescribe  a  host  of
    separate and cumulative requirements  to  be  satisfied  by  applicants
    belonging to each of these categories.  Paragraph 245AA  is  a  general
    provision which applies to all such applications.   Its  importance  is
    that, in appropriate cases, it operates as a mechanism for relaxing the
    strictness of a particular requirement or requirements.

22.   This  history  of  Paragraph  245AA  of  the  Immigration   Rules   is
    noteworthy.  It  was introduced by HC565, with effect from 06 September
    2012 and  without  transitional  provisions.   It  was  preceded  by  a
    provision  (also  paragraph  245AA)  entitled  "Documentary  Evidence",
    introduced on 30 June 2008 (HC607), renumbered as paragraph 245A on  06
    April 2011 (by HC863).  Following  its  introduction  on  06  September
    2012, paragraph 245AA was amended by extension, on 13 December 2012 (by
    HC760), with the addition of sub-paragraph (D)  which  relates  to  the
    provision by an applicant of a specified document either in  the  wrong
    format or which is a copy rather than an original.  Transitionally, any
    affected application made before 13 December 2012 and  undetermined  on
    that date was to be determined  in  accordance  with  the  pre-existing
    rules.  Next, on 01 October 2013, sub-paragraphs (b)-(d)  of  paragraph
    245AA were substituted by the version set out in [21].   Prior  to  the
    original introduction of paragraph 245AA, on  06  September  2012,  the
    issue of so-called "evidential flexibility"  was  governed  by  policy.
    There was a  UK  Border  Agency  policy  "PBS   Process  Instruction  -
    Evidential Flexibility".  This  policy  was  considered  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Rodriguez [2013] UKUT 0042 (IAC).   This  decision  of  the
    Upper Tribunal was overturned by the Court of Appeal:  see Secretary of
    State for the Home Department - v - Rodriguez [2014] EWCA Civ  2.   The
    final chapter remains to be written,  as  the  United  Kingdom  Supreme
    Court has granted permission to appeal.

23.  The amendments of paragraph 245AA of the Immigration  Rules  introduced
    on 01 October 2013, noted above, coincided with amendments of  Appendix
    FM-SE (by HC628), effective on the same date.  Appendix FM-SE had  been
    introduced on 20 July 2012 (by CM8423).  Its subject matter is  "Family
    Members - Specified Evidence".   The impact of these amendments was  to
    align the discretionary powers of waiver and further enquiry  contained
    in different compartments of the Immigration Rules.  Given the  virtues
    of clarity and consistency, this was a welcome development.  The effect
    of these amendments was to  create  discretion,  or  "flexibility",  in
    cases where specified information, though not provided, can be verified
    by other means and, further,  to  provide  some  clarification  of  the
    meaning of "a document  in  the  wrong  format".   This  clarification,
    notably,  is   provided   in   illustrative   and   inexhaustive,   not
    comprehensive, terms.  Judges at both tiers should be  alert  to  this.
    The amended provisions were considered by Foskett J recently  in  Gu  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2014]  EWHC  1634  (Admin)
    [2014] EWHC (Admin),  which  concerned  the  provision  relating  to  a
    document or documents missing from a sequence or series.

24.  Whatever the decision  making  context  under  the  Immigration  Rules,
    where  discretionary  powers  of  waiver  and/or  further  enquiry  are
    conferred, the possibility of a finding by a tribunal that  a  decision
    by the primary decision maker  was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law
    arises.  This would be so, for example, where it  can  be  demonstrated
    that the decision maker was not alert to the relevant  power  and  that
    such error was material.  Furthermore, by well  established  principle,
    where a decision maker declines to exercise a discretion of this  kind,
    belonging as it does to the domain of public law, the ensuing  decision
    is potentially open to  challenge  on  a  variety  of  grounds.   These
    include, inexhaustively  though  typically,  a  failure  to  take  into
    account  all   material   considerations;   disregarding   a   material
    consideration; emasculating the discretion  by  the  imposition  of  an
    inappropriate  fetter;  improper  motive;  material  error   of   fact;
    irrationality; and misunderstanding the  nature  and/or  scope  of  the
    discretion in play.  These are all  grounds  upon  which  the  ultimate
    refusal decision could, in principle,  be  successfully  challenged  on
    appeal or, where no appeal lies, by an application for judicial review.

25.  Where a decision is challenged on the basis of an unlawful  failure  to
    exercise a discretionary power of  further  enquiry  or  waiver  or  an
    unlawful exercise of such power, Judges will be guided  by  considering
    the purpose underlying powers of this  kind.   We  consider  that  such
    powers are to be viewed as dispensing provisions,  designed  to  ensure
    that applications suffering from minor defects or omissions  which  can
    be readily remedied or forgiven do not suffer  the  draconian  fate  of
    refusal.  In such cases, the blunt instrument  of  immediate,  outright
    and irrevocable rejection is softened to accommodate  applicants  whose
    applications suffer  from  insubstantial  imperfections  which  can  be
    easily  and  swiftly  rectified  or  excused.   Furthermore,   in   our
    estimation, discretionary powers of further enquiry and waiver  promote
    the  valuers  of  fairness  and  common  sense,  while   simultaneously
    minimising  unnecessary  dominance  of  and  emphasis  on  bureaucratic
    formality. They also  fortify  the  overall  integrity  of  the  United
    Kingdom immigration system, as expressed in the UKBA  letter  dated  19
    May 2011 wherein the origins of these powers  can  be  discovered:  see
    Appendix A to the decision of the Upper Tribunal in Rodriguez  (supra).
    We further consider that, in the particular context of paragraph  245AA
    of the Immigration Rules, these powers are properly  to  be  viewed  as
    measures capable of promoting the economic wellbeing of the country and
    should be construed accordingly.  Thus the mechanism initially known as
    "evidential flexibility" and promulgated in a  policy,  now  superseded
    and expressed in more elaborate and regimented terms in the Immigration
    Rules, serves to  advance  an  identifiable  public  interest  of  some
    importance.

26.   We  note,  for  completeness,  what  we  believe  to  be  the   latest
    development in this sphere, namely the promulgation of an  "Immigration
    Directorate Instruction" on behalf of the Secretary of  State  in  July
    2014.  This "IDI" bears the title "Family Members under Appendix FM and
    Appendix Armed Forces of the Immigration Rules".   Chapter  3  of  this
    publication is entitled "Operating Principles".   It  considers,  under
    separate headings, the topics of meeting the financial requirement, the
    level of the financial requirement and evidence requirements.  This  is
    followed  by  a  discrete  section   under   the   rubric   "Evidential
    Flexibility".  For convenience, we have included this as an appendix to
    this determination.  While this instrument, of course, did not apply to
    the decision which was the subject of the present appeal, it will be of
    progressively increasing importance.

  27. A reminder that instruments such as IDIs do not  have  the  status  of
      Immigration Rules is timely. They have  a  statutory  foundation,  per
      paragraph 1(3) of Schedule  2  to  the  Immigration  Act  1971,  which
      provides:

           "In the exercise of their functions under this  Act  Immigration
           Officers shall act in accordance  with  such  instructions  (not
           inconsistent with the Immigration Rules) as may be given them by
           the Secretary of State ......... ".

     IDI's operate as guides, or policies, which may influence the  decision
    in any given case.  Their orientation is  inwards,  being  directed  to
    case  workers  and  decision  makers.   They  also  have  an   external
    orientation, as they publicly available and serve to  inform  both  the
    actions and decisions of individuals and  the  advice  given  to  them.
    IDI's  are incapable of emasculating or modifying a  provision  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  Hierarchically, they are inferior.  This  is  clear
    from section 3(2) of the statute and the express language  of  Schedule
    2.  Additionally, there is the constitutional  consideration  that,  in
    common with any Government policy or guidance, they lack  Parliamentary
    oversight and approval.  They are not to be confused  with  either  the
    Immigration Rules or any form of legislation.

28.   Given  the  recurring  phenomenon  of  IDIs   co-existing   with   the
    Immigration Rules  and  their  prominence  in  immigration  appeals,  a
    reminder of one particular aspect of the correct doctrinal approach  is
    instructive.   Lord Hoffmann stated in Odelola v Secretary of State for
    the Home  Department  [2009]  1  WLR  1230,  in  which  a  question  of
    construction of the Immigration Rules arose, at [4]:

     "Like any other question of construction,  this  .......  depends  upon
         the  language  of  the  Rule,  construed   against   the   relevant
         background.  That involves a consideration of the Immigration Rules
         as a whole and the function which they serve in the  administration
         of immigration policy".

     In the same case, Lord Brown suggested, in [33], that the intention  to
    be ascertained by the Court or Tribunal is that  of  the  Secretary  of
    State, the maker of the  Rules.   Reverting  to  this  theme  in  Mahad
    (Ethiopia) Entry  Clearance  Officer  [2010],  1  WLR  48,  Lord  Brown
    developed this theme further, at [10]:

         "But that  intention  is  to  be  discerned  objectively  from  the
         language  used,  not  divined  by  reference  to  supposed   policy
         considerations.   Still less is the Secretary of State's  intention
         to be discovered from the  Immigration  Directorate's  instructions
         [IDI'S] issued intermittently  to  guide  immigration  officers  in
         their application of the Rules".

     [Emphasis added]

     As Lord Brown emphasised, IDIs  are  issued  under  paragraph  1(3)  of
    Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act  1971.   They  are  directed  by  the
    Secretary of State to Immigration Officers.  In the statutory language,
    Immigration Officers "shall act in accordance with such  instructions".
    There is nothing in this language to convey any  intention  that  IDI's
    can override the Immigration Rules.  In short, IDIs cannot  inform  the
    meaning of the Immigration Rules.  This conclusion is both unsurprising
    and unavoidable, given the  hierarchical  analysis  to  which  we  have
    adverted above.

29.   We  also  draw  attention  to  three  principles  emerging  from   the
    jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal.  In Adedoyin v Secretary of State
    for the Home Department [2011] 1 WLR 564 it was decided that  in  cases
    where there is genuine ambiguity about the meaning of  a  provision  of
    the Immigration Rules, it is legitimate to derive assistance  from  the
    executive's formally published guidance, including IDIs: per Rix LJ  at
    [70].  Construed carefully and narrowly, this  principle  can  co-exist
    harmoniously with Adedoyin.   More recently, the Court  of  Appeal,  in
    Pokhriyal v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA  Civ
    1568, having endorsed the Adedoyin  principle,  developed  two  further
    principles.  First, reliance by the Secretary of State upon  extraneous
    materials (such as IDIs) in order to persuade a court  or  tribunal  to
    construe a provision of  the  Immigration  Rules  more  harshly  or  to
    resolve an ambiguity in the executive's favour  is  impermissible.   As
    Jackson LJ stated, at [43]:

         "The Secretary of State holds all  the  cards.   The  Secretary  of
         State drafts the Immigration Rules; the Secretary of  State  issues
         IDI's and guidance statements; the Secretary  of  State  authorises
         the public statements made by his/her officials".

     This collection  of  truisms  prompted  his  Lordship  to  formulate  a
    further, related principle:

     "The Secretary of State cannot toughen up the rules otherwise  than  by
         making formal amendments and laying them before Parliament".

     This analysis follows from the reasoning of  the  Supreme  Court  in  R
    (Alvi) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] 1 WLR 2208.

30.  Thus IDIs, in  common  with  comparable  instruments  of  Secretary  of
    State's guidance or policy, are subservient in nature, the  handmaidens
    of the Immigration Rules.  Instruments of  this  kind,  notwithstanding
    their legal status, can, nonetheless, feature in a Tribunal's review of
    whether a decision was in accordance with the law.  This follows   from
    a  correct  understanding  of  their  status.   In  public  law  terms,
    policies, or guides, of  this  kind  have  the  status  of  a  material
    consideration in cases where they are engaged.  Accordingly, a decision
    maker's failure to have regard to this kind of instrument  may  operate
    to vitiate the decision under challenge.  Similarly, where  a  decision
    maker purports to have regard  to  the  guidance  but  misconstrues  or
    misapplies it. This kind of instrument can also, in principle, engender
    a substantive legitimate expectation to which the law will give effect.
     Our final observation concerning IDIs is that provided their terms are
    consistent with the provisions of the Immigration Rules to  which  they
    relate, they may, potentially, fulfil a further role,  namely  that  of
    illuminating the rationale and policy underpinning the relevant  Rules.
    This is illustrated  in the statement in paragraph  3.4.2  of  the  IDI
    appended hereto that:

         "Decision makers are also able  to  grant  an  application  despite
         minor evidential problems ....."

     We merely add that statements of this kind, do not  preclude  arguments
    to the effect that the underlying policy or rationale is other than  as
    stated.

Decision

31.  Giving effect to the above analysis and conclusions:

    (a)  We set aside the decision of the FtT.

         (b)  We  re-make  said  decision  by  dismissing  the  Respondents'
appeals to the FtT.

         As a result, we affirm the decisions of the ECO.

                                               THE HON. MR JUSTICE McCLOSKEY
                                             PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                              IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBER
                                                     Date:   19 October 2014


                                  APPENDIX


      Evidential Flexibility Provisions in the Immigration Directorate
                                Instructions
   relating to family members under Appendix FM and Appendix Armed Forces
                    of the Immigration Rules [July 2014]


3.4.1. There is discretion  for  decision-makers  to  defer  an  application
      pending submission of missing evidence or the correct version  of  it,
      within a reasonable deadline set for this.  Decision-makers  will  not
      have to defer where they do not think that  correcting  the  error  or
      omission will lead to a grant.

3.4.2. Decision-makers are also able to grant an application  despite  minor
      evidential problems (but  not  where  specified  evidence  is  missing
      entirely).

3.4.3. There is also discretion for decision-makers  where  evidence  cannot
      be supplied because it is not issued in a particular  country  or  has
      been permanently lost.

3.4.4.  Decision-makers  have  general  discretion  to  request   additional
      information or evidence before making a decision.

3.4.5. The evidential flexibility is set out in paragraph D of Appendix  FM-
      SE:

    D.   (a)  In deciding an application in relation to which this Appendix
             states that specified documents must be  provided,  the  Entry
             Clearance Officer or Secretary of State ("the decision-maker")
             will consider documents that  have  been  submitted  with  the
             application, and will only consider documents submitted  after
             the application where sub-paragraph (b) or (e) applies.

         (b)  If the applicant:


             (i) Has submitted:


                  (aa) A sequence of documents and some of the documents  in
                       the sequence have been  omitted  (e.g.  if  one  bank
                       statement from a series is missing);


                  (bb) A document in the wrong format (for  example,  if  a
                       letter is not on letterhead paper as specified); or


                  (cc) A document  that  is  a  copy  and  not  an  original
             document; or


                  (dd) A  document  which  does  not  contain  all  of  the
                       specified information; or


             (ii)  Has not submitted a  specified  document,  the  decision-
                  maker may contact the applicant or his  representative  in
                  writing or otherwise, and request the document(s)  or  the
                  correct  version(s).  The  material  requested   must   be
                  received at the address specified in the request within  a
                  reasonable timescale specified in the request.


        (c)  The decision-maker will not request documents where he or  she
             does not anticipate  that  addressing  the  error  or  omission
             referred to in sub-paragraph (b) will lead to a  grant  because
             the application will be refused for other reasons.


        (d)  If the applicant has submitted:

             (i) A document in the wrong format; or

             (ii) A document that is a copy and not an original document, or



             (iii) A document that does not contain  all  of  the  specified
               information, but the missing information is verifiable from:

               (1) other documents submitted with the application,

               (2)  the  website  of  the  organisation  which  issued  the
             document, or

               (3)    the website of the appropriate regulatory  body,  the
                  application may be granted exceptionally,  providing  the
                  decision-maker  is  satisfied  that  the  document(s)  is
                  genuine and that the applicant meets the  requirement  to
                  which the document relates. The  decision-maker  reserves
                  the right to request the specified  original  document(s)
                  in the correct format in all  cases  where  sub-paragraph
                  (b) applies, and to refuse applications if this  material
                  is not provided as set out in sub-paragraph (b).


         (e)  Where the decision-maker is satisfied that there  is  a  valid
             reason why a specified document(s) cannot  be  supplied,  e.g.
             because it is not issued in a particular country or  has  been
             permanently lost, he or she may  exercise  discretion  not  to
             apply the  requirement  for  the  document(s)  or  to  request
             alternative  or  additional  information  or  document(s)   be
             submitted by the applicant.

         (f)  Before making a decision under Appendix FM or  this  Appendix,
             the  decision-maker  may  contact  the  applicant   or   their
             representative in writing or  otherwise,  to  request  further
             information or  documents.  The  material  requested  must  be
             received at the address specified in  the  request,  within  a
             reasonable timescale specified in the request.
