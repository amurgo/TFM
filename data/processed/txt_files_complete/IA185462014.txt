For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

1.    I have considered whether any parties require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

2.    This is an appeal by the appellant against a decision  of  First  Tier
Tribunal Judge E B Grant promulgated on 7 November 2014 which dismissed  the
appellant's appeal against the respondent's  decision  to  refuse  to  grant
leave to remain on the basis of established family and private life  in  the
UK.

Background

3.    The appellant  is  a  Ghanaian  citizen,  born  on  4  May  1964.  The
appellant entered the UK on 4 April 2003  in  possession  of  a  visit  visa
valid until 3 June 2003. The appellant has remained in the  UK  since  then.
The appellant made  two  applications  to  remain  outside  the  Immigration
Rules, both of which were  refused  by  the  respondent.  Neither  of  those
decisions by the respondent carried a right of appeal.

4.    On 12 February 2014, the appellant submitted an application for  leave
to remain  in  the  UK.  On  4  April  2014,  the  respondent  refused  that
application after considering Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  The
respondent decided that the appellant did not  fulfil  the  requirements  of
Paragraph S-LTRP1.7 nor  E-LTRP1.2(a)  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  nor  E-
LTRP2.2 of the Immigration Rules.

The Judge's Decision

5.    The  appellant  appealed  to  the  First  Tier  Tribunal.  First  Tier
Tribunal Judge E B Grant ("the judge")  dismissed  the  appeal  against  the
respondent's decision. The judge found that the  appellant  did  not  fulfil
the suitability criteria set out in Appendix FM and in particular  that  the
appellant's immigration history prevented her from meeting  the  suitability
criteria and placed emphasis on S-LTR1.6. The judge  found  that  there  was
nothing in the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  appellant's  case  which
merited  considering  proportionality  under  Article  8  outside   of   the
Immigration Rules.

6.    Grounds of appeal were lodged  and  on  5  January  2015,  First  Tier
Tribunal Judge P J G  White  granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
Tribunal stating that it was arguable that an incorrect approach to  Article
8 had been taken and that it was  arguable  that  the  judge's  findings  in
relation to the suitability criteria of S-LTR1.6 might not  have  been  open
to the judge.

The Hearing

7.    Mr Garrod submitted that the  judge  had  made  an  error  in  law  by
finding at paragraphs 11 and 12 that S-LTR1.6 was engaged because:

           (i)   The decision by the respondent was made on  the  basis  of
                 Paragraph S-LTR1.7 and not S-LTR1.6;

           (ii)  In any event, the  judge's  decision  that  the  appellant
                 could not  meet  the  suitability  requirements  was  based
                 entirely on the appellant's poor immigration history  as  a
                 person who had remained in the  UK  with  leave  to  remain
                 since 2003.

He argued that the appellant meets the requirements of  S-LTR1.7  which  was
the fulcrum of  the  respondent's  decision,  that  EX.1  should  have  been
considered  and  that,  in  any  event,  that  the  particular   facts   and
circumstances of the appellant's  case  means  that  she  would  succeed  if
Article 8 is considered outside the Immigration Rules.

8.    Mr Tufan, for the respondent, agreed that there was no reason for  the
judge to  consider  S-LTR1.6  and  that  S-LTR1.6  had  not  influenced  the
respondent's decision, however he argued that if that amounts  to  an  error
of law, it is not a material error of law and that there is no need  to  set
the decision aside.

Analysis

9.    The Home Office  bundle  in  this  case  does  not  just  contain  the
decision of 3 April 2014 (which is the subject matter of  this  appeal).  It
also (confusingly) contains a decision from an earlier application  dated  4
April 2013. I specifically asked parties' agents to  identify  the  decision
under consideration. I drew parties' agents' attention to the decision of  4
April 2013 and both parties' agents confirmed that that is not the  decision
which is the subject matter of this appeal; that earlier  decision  did  not
carry a right of appeal.

10.   The decision of 4 April 2013 is a decision where S-LTRP1.7 was  relied
on by the respondent. Submissions made by parties' agents in relation to  S-
LTRP1.7 are therefore entirely irrelevant because they do not relate to  the
decision of 3 April  2014.  The  decision  of  3  April  2014  narrates  the
respondent's view that the appellant failed to comply in a  number  of  ways
with the conditions  of  entry  clearance  granted  in  2003  and  that  the
appellant has spent 11 years unlawfully in the  UK  and  only  a  two  month
period lawfully. The decision related to an application  dated  12  February
2014. Neither S-LTRP1.6 nor S-LTRP1.7 are relied on  by  the  respondent  in
that decision.

11.   The judge's decision promulgated on 7 November 2014 turns on  findings
that the appellant's immigration history engages  S-LTR1.6.  S-LTR1.6  is  a
matter which was not considered by the respondent. It is competent  for  the
judge to consider the Immigration Rules in  their  entirety  but  he  should
only do so once he has given parties and their  agents  the  opportunity  to
comment on the  Rule  which  he,  independently,  found  determinative.  The
opportunity to lead evidence and make submissions on S-LTR1.6 was not  given
to either the appellant or the respondent. The  judge  found  that  S-LTR1.6
was engaged solely because of the appellant's immigration history. At  [12],
the judge narrates that the appellant remained in the UK unlawfully  for  11
years and, solely on that basis, finds that the appellant's presence in  the
UK is not conducive to the public good.

12.   The judge does not make adequate findings in fact in relation  to  the
engagement of S-LTR1.6 nor the character associations or other  reasons  why
it might be undesirable to allow the  appellant  to  remain  in  the  UK.  I
therefore find that the decision is tainted by a material error of  law  and
must be set aside.

13.   I was asked by both parties' agents that if I find  a  material  error
of law and set aside the decision, that I should arrange for a second  stage
reconsideration of this case. Mr Tufan asked that the second  stage  hearing
be conducted in the Upper Tribunal. Mr Garrod for the appellant  asked  that
the case be remitted to the First Tier Tribunal. I consider  the  wealth  of
documentary evidence  produced  in  this  case  and  find  that  it  is  not
necessary to remit this case. It is in the interests of  both  parties  that
this case is finally determined. There is enough evidence placed  before  me
to enable me to make my own findings in fact.

Findings in Fact

14    (a)   The appellant was granted entry clearance  as  a  visitor  on  3
    December 2002.  Her  entry  clearance  expired  on  3  June  2003.  The
    appellant entered the UK on 4 April 2003. She has remained  in  the  UK
    since then.

    (b)    On 7 July 2012, the appellant submitted an application for leave
    to remain outwith the Immigration Rules. That application  was  refused
    on 4 April 2013. The respondent relied on S-LTRP1.7 of the  Immigration
    Rules and argued that the appellant had failed to provide documentation
    requested by the respondent. That decision did not  carry  a  right  of
    appeal.

    (c)    The appellant submitted  a  further  application  for  leave  to
    remain in the UK which was refused on 12  February  2014.  On  3  March
    2014, the appellant was served with Form IS151A informing the appellant
    of her immigration status together with  a  "one  stop  warning"  under
    Section 120 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  On  3
    April  2014,  the  respondent  considered   the   appellant's   further
    representations and adhered to the decision made on 12  February  2014.
    On 7 April 2014, the respondent served a decision of notice  to  remove
    the appellant (which is a notice of an immigration  decision)  dated  3
    April 2014. It is against that decision that the appellant appeals.

    (d)    In 2008, the appellant met Frank Odame-Ayam, a  British  citizen
    originally from Ghana. Mr Odame-Ayam entered the  UK  in  1987.  On  25
    November 2011, the appellant and Mr Odame-Ayam  started  co-habitation.
    On 21 January 2014, the appellant made  an  application  for  leave  to
    remain as the unmarried partner  of  the  sponsor  which  lead  to  the
    respondent's decision of 3  April  2014.  The  respondent  refused  the
    appellant's application on 12 February 2014.

    (e)    The appellant's parents have passed away. The  appellant  has  a
    brother who now lives in Liberia and she has  a  sister  who  lives  in
    Togo. The appellant's nephew is an adult who lives in the  UK  and  who
    has a good relationship with the appellant.  The  appellant  has  three
    adult daughters from her first marriage in  Ghana.  Her  first  husband
    died in 1998.

    (f)    The appellant remarried in 2000. Her husband remained  in  Ghana
    when the appellant came to the  UK  in  2003.  The  appellant's  second
    marriage was dissolved by decree of divorce in Ghana on 15 August 2013.

    (g)    Between 2007 and 2009, the  appellant  worked  in  the  UK  even
    though she was not entitled to do so.

    (h)    Since the hearing of the First Tier Tribunal  in  October  which
    led to the decision promulgated on 7 November 2014, the  appellant  has
    married Mr Odame-Ayam. The appellant's new husband works as a  security
    guard. He earns approximately �1,500 gross per month. Mr Odame-Ayam has
    three daughters from a previous relationship, all of whom  are  adults.
    His youngest daughter is a student.

    (i)    Both the  appellant  and  Mr  Odame-Ayam  are  active  in  their
    Christian church. The appellant volunteers for charities.

    (j)    Since 2002, the  appellant's  new  husband,  Mr  Odame-Ayam  has
    visited Ghana on three occasions.

The Immigration Rules

15.   The appellant's application made on 21 January 2014 was for  leave  to
remain in the UK on the basis of her family life as an unmarried partner  of
a British citizen. That application requires  consideration  of  Section  E-
LTRP  of  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  That  section  of  the
Immigration Rules  includes  "immigration  status  requirements".  E-LTRP2.2
provides that the appellant must not be in the UK in breach  of  immigration
laws  unless  Paragraph  EX.1  applies.  It  is  beyond  dispute  that   the
appellant's presence in the UK is a breach of the immigration rules.

16.   Although the wording of the respondent's decision dated 3  April  2014
and the reasons for refusal letter of same date makes no  reference  to  any
specific paragraph of appendix FM, the  detail  given  in  the  reasons  for
refusal letter makes it clear that the respondent  believes  that  E-LTRP2.2
operates against the appellant and that the focus in  the  appellant's  case
moves on to Paragraph EX1.  The appellant  has  to  show  that  she  is  the
partner  of  a  British/settled  person  in  the  UK  and  that  there   are
"insurmountable obstacles" to their family life continuing outside the UK.

17.   The difficulty for the appellant is  that  the  evidence  demonstrates
that there are no insurmountable obstacles to family life with  her  partner
(now her husband) continuing outside the UK. Although the appellant and  her
new husband speak of the disruption that would be caused to  their  routines
and relationships by return to Ghana, both the  appellant  and  her  husband
can return to Ghana. Although the appellant's husband claims that he  has  a
fear of life in Ghana, that fear was not sufficient to  stop  him  returning
to Ghana three times since 2002 and attending funerals of his friends.

18.   The appellant's children are  adults  and  are  not  in  the  UK.  The
appellant's new husband's children are all adults, even though his  youngest
daughter  is  still  a  full  time  student.  In  committing  themselves  to
marriage, the appellant and her new husband embarked on a course which  must
have indicated to them that there would  be  significant  changes  to  their
existing family dynamics. There is no reliable  evidence  to  indicate  that
the family relationship  between  adults  would  break  down  nor  that  the
appellant's husband would be prevented from returning to  the  UK  to  visit
his adult children, nor that his adult  children  could  not  visit  him  in
Ghana.

19.   I remind myself of the case of Agyarko and others v SSHD 2015 WLR  (D)
205. At paragraph 25, it was stated  that  the  mere  fact  that  a  British
citizen had lived all of his life in the UK, had a job here and  might  find
it difficult, and might be reluctant, to relocate to another country,  could
not constitute insurmountable obstacles. EX.1 is against the appellant.

20.   The eligibility for indefinite leave to remain as a  partner  contains
financial requirements. The weight of evidence before me indicates that  the
appellant's new husband cannot meet the financial requirements. He does  not
have a gross annual income  of  at  least  �18,600.  There  is  no  reliable
evidence before me of additional savings.

21.   I have to draw the conclusion that the  appellant  cannot  fulfil  the
requirements of appendix FM to the Immigration Rules.

22.    The  appellant  argues  that  private  life  is  established  by  her
relationships and friendships in the UK, by her employment  in  the  UK,  by
her home, her church membership and her relationship with  the  man  who  is
now her husband.

23.   The appellant has lived in the UK  for  less  than  20  years  so  she
cannot fulfil the requirements of Paragraph 276ADE(iii).  The  appellant  is
over 18 years of age so she cannot  fulfil  the  requirements  of  Paragraph
276ADE(iv). The appellant is over 25 years of age so she cannot  fulfil  the
requirements of Paragraph 276ADE(v) and because the appellant has  lived  in
the UK for less than  20  years,  she  cannot  fulfil  the  requirements  of
Paragraph 276ADE(vi).

24.   The appellant cannot satisfy the requirements of Paragraph  276ADE  of
the Immigration Rules.

Article 8 Outside the Immigration Rules

25     (a)    The  appellant  cannot  satisfy  the  requirements  of  either
    Appendix  FM  or  Paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    appellant's argument is that the respondent's  decision  amounts  to  a
    disproportionate breach of the right to respect for private life.

    (b)    In MS v SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT  [2013]  CSIH
    52 it was held that before considering a case outwith  the  immigration
    rules, the application for leave to enter or remain must demonstrate  a
    good arguable case that leave should be granted outside the rules: that
    a distinct assessment of proportionality should be  made  to  determine
    whether removal would infringe the applicant's  Article  8  rights.  If
    that is not demonstrated,  it  can  be  assumed  that  the  applicant's
    Article 8 rights will be adequately dealt  with  by  applying  the  new
    rules.

    (c)    In Meera Muhiadeen Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA Civ 558 Lord  Justice
    Beatson confirmed it is necessary to  find  "compelling  circumstances"
    for going outside the Rules. He confirmed that "the passages  from  the
    judgments in the cases of Nagre and MF (Nigeria)  appear  to  give  the
    Rules  greater  weight  than  as  merely  a  starting  point  for   the
    consideration of the proportionality of an interference with Article  8
    rights". He did not consider that it is  necessary  to  use  the  terms
    "exceptional" or "compelling" to describe  the  circumstances,  and  it
    will suffice if that can be said to be the substance of the  tribunal's
    decision.

    (d)    In MM (Lebanon) and others 2014 EWCA Civ 985  it  was  suggested
    that where a particular set of the immigration rules are not a complete
    code, then the issue of proportionality under Article 8 will be more at
    large. In this respect in R (on the application of  Ganesabalan  [2014]
    EWHC 2712 (Admin) it was held that unlike  other  Rules  which  have  a
    built-in discretion based on exceptional circumstances, Appendix FM and
    Rule 276ADE are not a "complete code" so far as Article 8 compatibility
    is concerned because Appendix FM and Rule  276ADE  have  no  equivalent
    "exceptional circumstances" provision.

    (e)    If  I  find  such  compelling  circumstances,  I  then  have  to
    determine the following separate questions:

         (i)      Does family life, private  life,  home  or  correspondence
         exist within the meaning of Article 8

         (ii)     If so, has the right to respect for this  been  interfered
         with

         (iii)    If so, was the interference in accordance with the law

         (iv)     If so, was the interference  in  pursuit  of  one  of  the
         legitimate aims set out in Article 8(2); and

         (v)      If so, is the interference proportionate to the pursuit of
         the legitimate aim?

    (f)    Section 117 of the 2002 Act is a factor to be taken into account
    in  determining  proportionality.  I  appreciate  that  as  the  public
    interest provisions are  now  contained  in  primary  legislation  they
    override existing case law, Section 117A(2) requires me to have  regard
    to the considerations listed in Sections 117B and 117C.  I am conscious
    of my statutory duty to take these factors into account when coming  to
    my conclusions.  I am also aware that Section 117A(3) imposes  upon  me
    the duty of carrying out a balancing exercise.

    (g)    Because of the operation of Section 117B of the 2002 Act, I have
    to find that the maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in
    the public interest.

26.   Family life exists because the appellant is married. The  respondent's
decision does not bring an end to that  family  life,  it  just  means  that
family life has to be conducted elsewhere. I have already found  that  there
are no insurmountable obstacles to  the  appellant's  husband  returning  to
Ghana with the appellant. I take account of the fact that the appellant  and
her husband committed themselves to one another at a  time  when  they  knew
the appellant's immigration status was precarious.

27.   I must take account of Section 117B of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
and Asylum Act  2002  when  assessing  proportionality.  It  weighs  in  the
appellant's favour that she can speak English. It is not  clear  if  she  is
financially  independent.  Although  she  has  worked,  she  has   done   so
illegally. Although  the  appellant's  husband  works,  his  income  is  not
sufficient to meet the financial requirements set out in Appendix  FM.  What
weighs heavily against the appellant is that Section 117B(4) requires me  to
place little weight on either a  private  life  or  a  relationship  with  a
qualifying partner that is established when  the  appellant  is  in  the  UK
unlawfully. Section 117B(5) requires me to place little weight on a  private
life established when a person's immigration status is precarious.  (Section
117B(6) is not engaged).

28.   The effect of the respondent's decision  is  that  the  appellant  can
return to Ghana, her husband can return to Ghana with her  (or  soon  after)
and then married life can continue in  Ghana.  The  appellant  can  maintain
contact with the friends that she has gathered around her throughout her  12
years in the UK. The appellant can maintain contact  with  nephews  and  her
stepdaughters by means of instantaneous communications  and  by  visits.  If
the appellant wants to return to the UK, she  can  make  an  application  to
return as the spouse of her British citizen husband from Ghana. In  reality,
there is no breach to the right to respect  for  either  family  or  private
life.

29.   If there is a breach, then it is not disproportionate.  The  appellant
cannot fulfil the requirements of the Immigration  Rules.  Section  117B  of
the 2002 Act indicates that the public interest  outweighs  the  appellant's
interest.  Quite  apart  from  those  considerations,  the  effect  of   the
respondent's decision does not bring an end to family life. It might  change
the nature of the family life which has been established  but  it  does  not
bring that private life to an end; that private life must always  be  viewed
as precarious because the appellant has known since July 2003 that  she  has
no right to be in the UK. She cannot realistically have viewed  the  private
life that she  has  created  as  something  which  carried  the  promise  of
permanence.

Decision

30.   I therefore set aside the decision of First Tier Tribunal  Judge  E  B
Grant because it contains a material error of law.

31.   I substitute the following decision.

32.   The appeal is dismissed.
