Higgins Solicitors
For the Respondent:          Mr A Sharland, Counsel instructed by the
Treasury Solicitor

1.  The Court of Appeal, House of Lords and Luxemburg  authorities  on  race
and sex discrimination in employment are to be  used  as  a  guide  for  the
establishment of race discrimination in appeals to this  Tribunal;  but  the
questionnaire process available to employees is not applicable in  the  AIT,
and nor is the Burden of Proof Directive.  The  requirement  to  identify  a
comparator (actual or hypothetical) who would be  treated  better  than  the
appellant remains, however. 2.   The  demographic  process  of  establishing
disproportionate impact  by  statistics  (as  expounded  in  Jones  v  Chief
Adjudication Officer) is an appropriate process  for  establishing  indirect
racial discrimination in the AIT; but care is necessary to ensure  that  the
statistics are derived from comparable populations.   The  question  is  not
whether different groups do comply equally with any  condition  but  whether
there is a difference between groups in whether they  can  comply.   3.  The
more complex the issue, the less likely broadly-based statistics are  to  be
of help.  Where all the requirements of a particular  paragraph  of  HC  395
have to be satisfied, general figures relating to grants  and  refusals  may
reveal little about ability to comply with  any  individual  condition.   4.
Where statistics relate to self-selected groups (e.g. applicants  for  entry
clearance) they are perhaps even less  likely  to  assist.   5.   Where  the
statistics do show a disproportionate  impact  on  a  particular  racial  or
national group, the burden  shifts  to  the  Respondent  to  show  that  the
condition in question is justifiable within the  meaning  of  Balcombe  LJ's
dicta in Hampson v DES, and Barry v Midland Bank  Plc.   The  Tribunal  must
take into account the impact on the complainant (which is likely to  include
an assessment of the purpose for which admission or leave  was  sought)  and
the Respondent's reasons for  imposing  the  condition;  it  must  strike  a
balance between them and give reasons for the decision it reaches.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of India.  He appeals against  the  decision
    of the respondent on 3 August 2004 refusing him entry clearance to  the
    United Kingdom as a working holidaymaker.  His grounds of appeal  raise
    issues of race discrimination as well as issues under  the  Immigration
    Rules.  For that reason arrangements were made for it to be  considered
    by a panel of three legally qualified members so that guidance could be
    given on such appeals, if appropriate.

 2.  The  appellant's  application  form  is  undated  but  there  is   the
    respondent's date stamp for 25 March 2004.  It is an application for  a
    working holidaymaker's visa for two years.  It  acknowledges  that  the
    appellant had previously been refused a visa as a student, following an
    application on 9 July 2003.  It indicates  that  the  appellant  has  a
    brother in the United Kingdom and that the only  address  at  which  he
    will stay is a  named  address  in  Coventry.   He  gives  his  job  as
    "salesman (partner) in footwear business",  which  he  has  held  since
    1994.  He gives his monthly income as "50%".  He says  that  he  has  a
    �1,000 available to him for his stay and that his parents are going  to
    pay for the trip.  He says he will  take  "any  suitable  job"  in  the
    United Kingdom and under "other information" says that "from the last 8-
    10 years I am doing business in footwear".

 3. The appellant was interviewed by the respondent on 3 August  2004.   He
    confirmed that he was fit and well enough to be interviewed, not  tired
    or confused, and that he understood the interpreter.  He said  all  the
    details on his application form were correct.  He said  that  he  would
    stay in the United Kingdom for two years and that  the  reason  he  was
    going for a working holiday was because it was for two years.  He  gave
    an indication of a few sights that he would see in the United  Kingdom.
    He said that he would work at Kentucky Fried Chicken,  and  produced  a
    letter which the respondent comments was of "very  poor  quality".   He
    said that he would be able to get  a  job  there  although  he  had  no
    experience  and  no  qualification  because  "my   brother   works   as
    supervisor".  He said that his brother was paying for the trip, and  he
    produced evidence that his brother had funds.  He was asked  about  his
    work:

      "Q17: What do you do in India?
      A:    Salesman in a footwear shop
      Q18:  Income?
      A:    6,000 per month
      Q19:  Given leave for this period? Evidence?
      A:    Yes, no evidence
      Q20:  How did you manage to gain leave from your job for two years?
      A:    My partner will look after my work
      Q21:  Why leave your studies/career at this  stage  for  a  two  year
    break?
      A:    This is a working holiday scheme."

      He said that he would go back to his work when he  returned  to  India
    and that he would benefit by having had experience  of  working  in  an
    advanced country and would  use  that  experience.   He  was  asked  to
    comment on the Entry Clearance Officer's view that he appeared to  have
    little incentive to leave the UK after two years to  return  to  India.
    His comment was "my brother has send sponsorship, so I cannot spoil his
    record by overstaying".

 4. The respondent refused the application.  The notice of  refusal  is  in
    the following terms.

      "I am not satisfied, on  the  balance  of  probabilities,  that  your
        application  meets  the  requirements  of  paragraph  95,  and   in
        particular:


      I am not satisfied you intend to leave the UK  at  the  end  of  your
        working holiday.


      BECAUSE


      I note that you have never previously taken a holiday  overseas,  and
        were unable to describe in any detail the sights you wished to  see
        in the United Kingdom.  It is only reasonable to expect you to have
        at least researched some aspects of the country in which you intend
        to spend two years.


      You have been employed in India for a number of years, and I  do  not
        find it credible that at this stage of your life you should seek to
        go abroad on holiday for two years.  Neither have you satisfied  me
        that you will be able  to  resume  your  employment  after  such  a
        protracted absence.  I  consider  it  unrealistic  that  you  would
        jeopardise your career for the sake of a holiday.


      You have been unable to provide a satisfactory explanation as to  how
        the working holiday scheme would be of benefit  to  you,  and  what
        lasting advantages you would derive from it.


      Whilst it is reasonable that a young commonwealth citizen should seek
        to spend two years as a working holiday maker, you need to  satisfy
        me that you have the intention to leave the United  Kingdom.   This
        can only be  judged  by  taking  into  consideration  all  of  your
        circumstances.  I am mindful of the fact that you  have  little  in
        the way of realistic prospects for the future  in  India.   Against
        this background, you seek to spend two years on a  working  holiday
        in the United Kingdom, and your account of  your  circumstances  in
        India has simply failed to satisfy me that you  would  leave  after
        that period.


       The  evidence  of  your  proposed  employment  is  vague,   in   the
        circumstances, I am not satisfied that it constitutes  genuine  and
        meaningful employment.


      I therefore refuse your application."

 5. The grounds of  appeal  to  an  Adjudicator  simply  assert  that  "the
    appellant intends to leave the UK at the end of the  working  holiday".
    He has been permitted to vary them in the terms of paragraph 8  of  the
    skeleton argument now produced on his behalf:


            "(a) that the decision is not  in  accordance  with  Immigration
    Rules
          b) that the decision is otherwise not in accordance with the law
          c) that the decision is unlawful by virtue of Section 19B  of  the
             Race Relations Act of 1976  (c.74)  (discrimination  by  public
             authorities)."

 6. We heard oral evidence from the sponsor.  He  began  by  confirming  as
    true the contents of his witness statement made  on  2  February  2006,
    which we will need to summarise.  In it he says that he works full-time
    at Kentucky Fried Chicken in Coventry.  When the appellant was applying
    for a visa, he spoke to the manager, who wrote a letter  confirming  an
    offer of employment at Kentucky Fried Chicken  in  Oxford.   Since  the
    application, the sponsor had moved permanently to Coventry as his  wife
    and children had now joined him in the United Kingdom, so the job offer
    in Oxford would no longer be valid.

 7. On the appellant's employment history, the sponsor  comments  that  the
    appellant left school when he was quite young and has had a  number  of
    jobs since.  He is a hard worker and would not  find  it  difficult  to
    find work when he needed  it.   He  is  described  by  the  sponsor  as
    speaking "good English".  At the time  of  making  the  statement,  the
    appellant is said to have been working in a photography shop  belonging
    to another brother of the appellant and the sponsor; before that he had
    been working in a shoe shop for about ten years until the  shop  closed
    down.  When he returns to India after his working holiday he  plans  to
    open a shoe shop; he is also proposing to get married then.

 8. The sponsor asserts that the appellant has no intention of  overstaying
    any visa, and points out that in 2001 and 2005  the  sponsor's  parents
    (who are, of course, also the appellant's parents) visited the  sponsor
    for two months and returned within the currency of  their  visas.   The
    sponsor acknowledges that the appellant  has  made  an  application  to
    enter the United Kingdom as a  student.   The  sponsor  says  that  the
    appellant did not know that he  had  a  right  of  appeal  against  the
    refusal; then he decided that he did not want  to  undertake  any  more
    studies.

 9. So far as finances are concerned, the sponsor  says  that  his  parents
    "have also always agreed to assist my brother financially  if  needed",
    but that he, the sponsor, intends to support the appellant while he  is
    in the United Kingdom.  He has over �6,000 standing to his name in  two
    bank accounts.  He has adequate accommodation for the appellant in  his
    home.  Although the appellant has not arranged a list of sights to see,
    both he and the sponsor have some plans.  As the sponsor says, "this is
    only a short trip to experience life in  another  country,  spend  time
    with me and work for a while".

10. In his oral evidence the sponsor confirmed that he was able to pay  for
    the appellant's trip, but his parents  had  also  given  the  appellant
    �1,000 "expenses".  When asked how he would ensure that  the  appellant
    returned to India at the end of a working  holiday,  the  sponsor  said
    that he would not support him any more  after  his  visa  expired.   In
    cross-examination, Mr Sharland pointed out that when the appellant  was
    interviewed he said that the  trip  was  going  to  be  funded  by  the
    sponsor, not by his parents: the sponsor said that it was right to  say
    that he was going to pay for the  appellant's  trip  and  his  expenses
    here, apart from �1,000 pocket money from his parents.

11. We asked the sponsor a number of questions about his employment and the
    accommodation, arising from the documents that had been produced.   The
    sponsor confirmed that his present work was at Kentucky Fried  Chicken;
    he was unable to give us the address where he worked or the name of the
    company or the name of his manager.  He did show us some payslips.   He
    said that his work was in the kitchen at Kentucky Fried Chicken; he had
    moved to Coventry in December 2005 and was now  being  paid  only  just
    over half of what he was being paid in Oxford.  He said "yes.   I  have
    applied for another job."  (His present income appears to be about �130
    per week).

12. The house mentioned in the appellant's application as the  place  where
    he would stay for the two years of his working holiday was, the sponsor
    told us, bought in 2003.  He did not go and live in it.  He  rented  it
    out to some people whose name he gave us.  They paid him rent of  about
    �350 per week.  He did not move into the house until his wife and child
    joined him in 2005.  He confirmed that since he has owned the house  he
    has used his ownership of it to  support  two  applications  for  entry
    clearance.  Some of the  relevant  papers  are  amongst  the  documents
    supporting this appeal.  There is a declaration signed by  the  sponsor
    and dated 18 March 2004 containing at paragraph 6, the following:


        "I own [the house in question]  aforesaid  three-bedroom  property.
        There is ample accommodation there to accommodate my  brother  [the
        appellant]."

      The documents relating to the ownership of the property were  produced
    to support the sponsor's application for entry clearance for  his  wife
    and son.  There is a letter dated 4  November  2003,  signed  by  Nisar
    Khan, a partner in a firm of solicitors called The Law  Partnership  in
    Coventry.  The second paragraph of the letter reads:

      "I confirm that the property was purchased by  [the  sponsor]  on  15
        August 2003 and that he was granted  the  right  of  occupation  as
        owner on that date."

13. The other partner in the same firm of  solicitors,  Abdul  Salam  Khan,
    signed a  statement  dated  19  November  2003  specifically  prepared,
    following a personal visit to the property.  After setting out that the
    sponsor owns the property and describing it, the statement continues as
    follows:

        "The property is currently occupied  by  [the  sponsor]  ...  I  am
        satisfied that the addition of one  more  female  adult  would  not
        render the property overcrowded within the meaning of part X of the
        Housing Act."

14. From the sponsor's evidence before us it became clear, and he accepted,
    that he had not been living in the property in question when the letter
    or either of the  statements  was  prepared.   The  property  had  been
    occupied by his tenants as their home.  We suggested that  it  followed
    that on the dates those letters were prepared and on the dates  of  any
    decisions in applications supported  by  them,  the  property  was  not
    actually available for the accommodation  of  any  applicant  as  those
    documents suggest and state.   The  sponsor's  response  was  that  his
    tenants had vacated the property when he had asked  them  to,  as  they
    said they would.

15. There was no other oral evidence.  We do not need to summarise  any  of
    the other documentary evidence relating to the appellant's  application
    itself.  The allegations of racial  discrimination  were  supported  by
    documents including a Home Office consultation document on the  Working
    Holidaymakers  Scheme  apparently  dating  from  2002,  statistics  for
    working holidaymakers from 2002 to  2005,  further  similar  statistics
    contained in a ministerial written answer on 12 September 2005, and the
    report of the independent monitor appointed under the  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 1999 to monitor refusals of entry clearance where  there  is
    no right of appeal.  In her submissions Miss Muthusagaran  referred  to
    Anya v University of Oxford [2001] EWCA Civ 405  and  CS  [2006]  UKAIT
    00004.  Anya is a case relating to racial discrimination in employment.
      The  authorities  on  that  issue  and  on  those  relating  to   sex
    discrimination have relevance to this appeal, as the legislation is  in
    similar terms.

The Appeal under the Immigration Rules

16. We will look first at the appeal on the grounds that the  decision  was
    not in accordance with the Immigration Rules.  The question we have  to
    decide is whether,  on  the  material  now  available  to  us,  we  are
    satisfied that the appellant should  have  been  granted,  rather  than
    refused, the visa he sought.  The  burden  of  proof  is  on  him;  the
    standard is the balance of probabilities.  We are  concerned  with  the
    position as it was at the date of  the  decision,  but  in  making  our
    decision we take in  to  account  all  the  evidence  relevant  to  the
    position on that date,  even  if  the  evidence  itself  postdates  the
    decision.

17. There is a multitude of problems in the evidence said to  support  this
    appeal.  It is right to  say,  as  has  been  said  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant, that an applicant for a working holidaymaker's visa does not
    have to have firm plans for how he will spend his time for the whole of
    his trip; is allowed to fund the trip in a variety of  different  ways;
    and does not have to show that the trip  would  be  of  any  particular
    benefit to him.  But one of the requirements of the Rules  is  that  he
    intends to leave the United Kingdom at the end of his working  holiday.
    Nobody pretends that it is easy to assess whether that requirement  has
    been met.  It has to be assessed by looking at all the  evidence.   The
    principal  primary  evidence  is  likely  to  be  the  appellant's  own
    assertion that he will leave.   A  decision-maker,  whether  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer or the Tribunal, therefore needs  to  assess  whether
    the appellant's statements are sufficiently worthy of credit  for  this
    particular assertion to be persuasive.

18. In the present case we see, firstly, that the  appellant  stated  quite
    clearly in his application form that his  parents  would  pay  for  his
    trip, but in his interview that his brother would pay.  He said that he
    would work at  Kentucky  Fried  Chicken,  because  his  brother  was  a
    supervisor  there,  but  that  alleged  job  offer   has   never   been
    substantiated and in our view the Entry Clearance Officer was right  to
    make the point that it was "of very poor quality":   in  particular  it
    bears no resemblance to the letter from the  same  employer  confirming
    the sponsor's employment.  The appellant gave  his  own  occupation  as
    that of a partner in a shoe shop but neither then or  subsequently  has
    he provided any explanation of how the business was to continue for two
    years with one of its partners absent in England.  The  appellant  said
    that he would be in the UK for two years, giving  as  his  reason  only
    that that was the period for  which  working  holidaymaker  visas  were
    available, but his sponsor thought that his visit would be a short one.
     The appellant responded to one of the questions at  his  interview  on
    the basis that he did not speak  English:  the  sponsor  described  the
    appellant as speaking good English.

19. Further, as appeared for the first time in the oral evidence before us,
    the written evidence as  to  accommodation  was  at  the  date  of  the
    decision entirely unreliable.  We appreciate that the sponsor owned the
    house and that he intended to recover possession of it  when  his  wife
    came to the United Kingdom, but the position was that he had let it  to
    tenants who occupied it as their home and he was by no means assured of
    being able to recover possession of it at any particular time  that  he
    chose.  In particular, the position at the date  of  the  decision  was
    that the sponsor was still working in Oxford and, as we understand  the
    matter, he had no intention of working in Oxford  and  living  in  this
    house in Coventry.  The house was to accommodate  him  and  his  family
    when they came: at that time he ceased working in Oxford.  Thus, as  it
    now appears, the evidence as to accommodation was  simply  inconsistent
    with the evidence as to employment either of  the  sponsor  or  of  the
    appellant.  The sponsor's employment is itself of  some  importance  in
    this case, because of the claim made by  both  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor that the expenses of the trip would be paid by the sponsor.  At
    the date of the decision the sponsor had an income  of  some  �250  per
    week and we accept that that  would  have  been  sufficient.   But  the
    position  is  also  that  the  application  was  on  the   basis   that
    accommodation would be in Coventry and the  evidence  before  us  shows
    that the accommodation in  Coventry  only  became  available  when  the
    sponsor moved there and occupied his house there, at which  point  also
    he took a  pay  cut  of  nearly  50%  and  had  the  responsibility  of
    supporting his family in this country.

20. The position is that, looking at the evidence as a whole as we  do,  we
    are entirely satisfied that neither the appellant nor the  sponsor  has
    been entirely frank in their approach to this application  and  appeal.
    It is for the appellant to establish that  he  intended  to  leave  the
    United  Kingdom  at  the  conclusion  of  his   visit   and,   in   the
    circumstances, we see no reason to believe his word.

21. We therefore conclude that the appellant has not discharged the  burden
    of proof and will dismiss his appeal under the Immigration Rules.

The Entry Clearance Officer's Approach

22. Because of the other allegations which are  made  in  this  appeal,  we
    think it appropriate  to  comment  on  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision as it was made by him on the evidence before him.  He did  not
    of course have the oral evidence of  the  sponsor,  and  did  not  know
    anything of the subsequent history.  Nevertheless,  it  appears  to  us
    that he did everything that he could be expected to do in order to,  if
    we may so express it, meet the appellant where he was.

23. It was the appellant who said that  he  wanted  to  be  in  the  United
    Kingdom for two years and could give no reason for choosing that period
    other than because it was the period for which  working  holidaymakers'
    visas are available.  Two years is quite a long time, and it cannot  be
    regarded as unreasonable to expect that a person  who  has  decided  to
    spend two years in a foreign country should have some reasonably  clear
    idea of why the destination and the period of time have been chosen.

24. It was the appellant who said that he was a partner in his  shoe  shop.
    It is by no means unreasonable to expect a person who  is  leaving  for
    two years a business in which he works and half of which  he  owns,  to
    have a clear and exact knowledge of the way in which the business  will
    work in his absence and how he will be able to return to it.

25. It was the appellant who relied wholly on employment at Kentucky Friend
    Chicken.  In the  circumstances,  and  bearing  in  mind  that  he  was
    producing a letter to show that his brother was employed there,  it  is
    far from unreasonable to consider  that  the  entirely  different  note
    purporting  to  offer  him  a  job  was  completely  unsatisfactory  as
    supporting evidence.

26. Even without the  further  difficulties  arising  from  the  additional
    evidence before us, we consider  that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision, on the basis  of  the  material  before  him,  was  not  only
    entirely appropriate: it was unavoidable.

Race Discrimination: Introduction

27. The appellant also appeals on grounds of  discrimination.   After  some
    initial uncertainty, Miss Muthusagaran confirmed  that  the  allegation
    was of discrimination on grounds of nationality.   We  are  content  to
    accept  that,  in  this  jurisdiction,  despite  some  differences   in
    procedure,  the  main  principles  are  those  alluded  to  in  Anya  v
    University of Oxford as having been set out by Neill LJ in King v Great
    Britain - China Centre [1992] ICR 516:

      "(1)  It is for the applicant who complains of racial  discrimination
        to make out his or her case.  Thus if the applicant does not  prove
        the case on the balance of probabilities he or she will fail.   (2)
        It is important to bear in mind that it is unusual to  find  direct
        evidence of racial discrimination.  Few ...  will  be  prepared  to
        admit such discrimination even to themselves.  In  some  cases  the
        discrimination will not be ill-intentioned but merely based  on  an
        assumption that 'he or she would not have  fitted  in'.   (3)   The
        outcome  of  the  case  will  therefore  usually  depend  on   what
        inferences it is proper to draw from the primary facts found ...  .
        (5)  It is unnecessary and unhelpful to introduce the concept of  a
        shifting evidential burden of proof.  At the conclusion of all  the
        evidence the Tribunal should make findings as to the primary  facts
        and draw such inferences as they consider proper from those  facts.
        They  should  then  reach  a   conclusion   on   the   balance   of
        probabilities, bearing in mind both the difficulties which  face  a
        person who complains of unlawful discrimination and the  fact  that
        it is for the complainant to prove his or her case."

28. In the present appeal the appellant asserts both  direct  and  indirect
    racial discrimination.  Section 1(1) of the Race Relations Act 1976  is
    as follows:

      "1.   Racial discrimination


      (1)   A person discriminates against  another  in  any  circumstances
           relevant for the purposes of any provision of this Act if -
            (a)  on racial grounds he treats  that  other  less  favourably
               than he treats or would treat other persons; or
            (b)  he applies to that other a requirement or condition  which
               he applies or would apply equally to persons not of the same
               racial group as that other but -
                 (i)   which is such that the proportion of persons of  the
                    same racial group as that other who can comply  with  it
                    is considerably smaller than the proportion  of  persons
                    not of that racial group who can comply with it; and
                 (ii)  which he cannot show to be justifiable  irrespective
                    of the colour, race, nationality or ethnic  or  national
                    origins of the person to whom it is applied; and
                 (iii) which is to the detriment of that other  because  he
                    cannot comply with it."

29. Section 3 of the same Act defines "racial grounds" and "racial  groups"
    in such a way as to make it clear that those  phrases  include  grounds
    and  groups  relating  to  nationality  as  well   as   race.    Direct
    discrimination on grounds of nationality  is  thus  encompassed  within
    s1(1)(a), and indirect discrimination  on  grounds  of  nationality  in
    s(1)(b).  We do not need to set out subsections  (1A)  -  (1B)  of  s1.
    They were inserted  from  19  July  2003  in  compliance  with  Council
    Directive 2000/43/EC.   Article  3.2  of  that  Directive  specifically
    excludes from its scope provisions of  national  law  relating  to  the
    entry into or residence in a Member State of third country nationals or
    stateless persons.  These subsections do not apply to this appeal.

30. Section 19B of the Act makes it unlawful  for  a  public  authority  in
    carrying out any  function  of  the  authority  to  do  any  act  which
    constitutes discrimination.  The respondent to this appeal is for these
    purposes a public authority.

Direct Racial Discrimination

31. The  appellant's  claim  of  direct  racial  discrimination  is  based,
    firstly, on the terms of the notice of refusal and,  secondly,  on  his
    suggestion that the respondent applies in his post  certain  tests  for
    applicants for the Working Holidaymakers Scheme that are not applied at
    other posts.

32. The first of those  two  points  depends  to  a  large  extent  on  the
    reference,  twice,  to  "India"  in  the  notice  of   refusal.    Miss
    Muthusagaran emphasised in particular the phrase "little in the way  of
    realistic prospects for the future in India".  She submitted that it is
    inappropriate for the respondent to make a decision based so clearly on
    the nationality of the applicant.  The  wording  used,  she  submitted,
    suggests that if the applicant had not been Indian a different decision
    might have resulted.

33. In our view there  is  nothing  in  this  submission.   The  respondent
    properly identified the appellant's nationality, as we have done in the
    first sentence of this determination.  The respondent was  required  to
    consider the appellant's application in the context  in  which  it  was
    made, that is to say by an Indian in India.  The reference to India  in
    the reasons for refusal adds nothing except clarity to them.  It cannot
    properly be read as indicating any ground of discrimination.

34. As we have indicated, we  think  that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision on the application, simply comparing what the  appellant  said
    with the requirements of the Rules, was  inevitable.   Faced  with  the
    evidence the applicant produced, any Entry Clearance Officer  ought  to
    have  refused  this  application,  whatever  the  nationality  of   the
    appellant.  In this context the appellant cannot show that he has  been
    the victim of racial discrimination.

35. It follows also that he cannot succeed in this appeal by  demonstrating
    (if he were able to demonstrate) that different  tests,  additional  to
    those in the Immigration Rules, are imposed  at  some  posts  overseas.
    The appellant's application failed under the Immigration Rules,  as  it
    was bound to do.

Indirect Racial Discrimination

36. The claim of indirect racial  discrimination  is  based  on  a  certain
    series of statistics.  These show that a proportion of applications for
    working holidaymakers' visas that are successful is very  substantially
    lower in certain posts, including New Delhi, than it is in other posts,
    including those in Canada and Australia.  The argument, such as it  is,
    is strengthened by comments in the report of the  Independent  Monitor,
    who  observed  similar  disparities  in  the  success  rate  of   those
    applications with which she was concerned.  Miss Muthusagaran relied on
    these figures as demonstrating  indirect  racial  discrimination.   She
    submitted that a lower success  rate  in  New  Delhi  showed  that  the
    proportion of  Indians  who  comply  with  the  Immigration  Rules  was
    considerably  smaller  than  the  proportion  of   persons   of   other
    nationalities who could comply, and further submitted that there was no
    justification for the difference.  Mr Sharland responded  substantively
    to each of those submissions, and we shall deal with them in turn.

37. First, merely showing a statistical difference between success rates at
    various posts is an entirely inadequate way of  demonstrating  indirect
    racial  discrimination.     Without  knowing  whether  the  groups   of
    applicants are broadly similar, it is impossible to reach  judgment  on
    the relevance of the differences in the  refusal  rates.   One  obvious
    possibility is that, in Australia and Canada, applicants only apply for
    entry clearance if they are reasonably confident  that  they  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules whereas, as it may be, applicants
    in India are more likely to apply with a mere hope that  they  will  be
    successful.  Another possibility is that, although clearly  anybody  in
    the world can have an intention to return to their own country  at  the
    end of a working holiday, applicants at one post do have that intention
    in greater numbers than at another.  We do not  know.   Applicants  for
    entry clearance form self-selected groups and the precise criteria  for
    membership of the group are in general not known.   What  is  clear  is
    that treating various groups of  applicants  as  identical  would  mean
    asserting a general identity between them which would be  based  on  no
    evidence and wrong in principle.

38. In Jones v Chief Adjudication Officer [1990] IRLR 533  CA,  Mustill  LJ
    set out the process for determining whether indirect discrimination  is
    established in respect of one criterion.   It  is  apparent  that  when
    there are multiple  criteria  (as  there  are  in  an  entry  clearance
    application, which will not succeed unless all the requirements of  the
    Rules  are  met)  the  process  will  be  substantially  more  complex.
    Further,  the  more  complex  the  criteria,  the  more  detailed   the
    demographic  statistics  must  be  before  the  discrimination  can  be
    established.

39. What the appellant needs to show in order to succeed in  this  part  of
    his discrimination claim is that  the  proportion  of  (in  this  case)
    Indians who can comply with all the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules is considerably smaller than the proportion  of  non-Indians  who
    can comply.  All  he  has  shown  is  that  the  proportion  of  Indian
    applicants who do comply with all the requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules is smaller than the proportion of applicants at some other  posts
    who do comply, the proportions in both cases being  taken  from  groups
    which are not shown to be  comparable.   Based  as  it  essentially  is
    solely on those statistics, the claim is doomed to failure.

40. If the appellant had been able to show that the  Immigration  Rules  or
    some part of them had a disproportionate impact on Indians, the  burden
    of proof would have shifted to the respondent (strictly,  perhaps,  the
    Government, or the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department,  who
    promotes the Rules, rather than the Entry Clearance Officer who applies
    them) to show that the difference is justifiable.  The meaning of  that
    word was explained by Balcombe LJ in his dissenting judgment in Hampson
    v DES [1989] ICR 179, at p191:

        "In my judgment 'justifiable' requires an objective balance between
        the discriminatory effect of the condition and the reasonable needs
        of the party who applies the condition."

41. Further explanation was provided by the European Court  of  Justice  in
    Enderby v Frenchay Health Authority [1994] ICR 112, and by the House of
    Lords in Webb v EMO Air Cargo (UK) Ltd [1993] ICR 175  (where  Balcombe
    LJ's words were expressly approved) and Barry v Midland Bank Plc [1999]
    ICR 859.  In the latter case Lord Nicholls,  expounding  Enderby,  said
    this at p870:

        "The ground relied upon as  justification  must  be  of  sufficient
        importance for the national court to regard this as overriding  the
        disparate effect of the difference in treatment, either in whole or
        in part.  The more serious the disparate impact ... the more cogent
        must  be  the  objective  justification.   There  seem  to  be   no
        particular criteria to which the national court should have  regard
        when assessing the weight of the justification relied on."

42. As we have made clear above, this is not a case in which the burden  of
    proof has passed to the respondent.  If it had done, we  consider  that
    the following features of the maintenance of a  working  holidaymakers'
    scheme would seem to be of considerable importance. The need to  ensure
    that those participating were genuinely intending merely a holiday  and
    intended to return home at the end of it, so that the  scheme  was  not
    abused as a mode of primary immigration; the need to  ensure  that  any
    work was (broadly speaking) incidental to  the  holiday,  so  that  the
    scheme was not abused as a way into work for which a work permit should
    have been obtained; the need to ensure that there were  adequate  funds
    and arrangements available (whether by appropriate work or  otherwise),
    so that the applicant's  holiday  would  have  no  foreseeable  adverse
    impact on the UK economy by way of the benefits system or  a  need  for
    repatriation.  We cannot determine this issue in the abstract,  but  we
    think it highly likely that these factors  would  suffice  to  show  an
    objective justification for the  criteria  in  the  Rules  despite  any
    disparate impact on applicants, who would, at most, be  prevented  from
    taking a particular type of holiday.

General Guidance

43. First, where direct or indirect discrimination is alleged, it may  well
    be helpful, as well as looking at the appeal in the usual way,  to  try
    to take a view on the effect of the evidence actually available to  the
    decision-maker at  the  time  the  decision  was  made.   Secondly,  in
    deciding whether an allegation  of  discrimination  is  made  out,  the
    process recommended by the Court of Appeal in King v  Great  Britain  -
    China Centre should be applied, as set out in paragraph 27 above.   The
    questionnaire process under s65 of the 1976 Act (to which  the  passage
    there omitted refers) is not applicable to appeals  to  this  Tribunal:
    see s65(7)(b).

44. Thirdly, where indirect discrimination is being alleged on the basis of
    statistical evidence, part of the burden of proof as it  rests  on  the
    appellant is to establish that the statistics produced are relevant  to
    the claim he makes.  Statistics which do not as a matter of logic  show
    a difference in ability to comply with the  Rule  in  question  do  not
    advance the claimant's case.

45.  Fourthly,  if  statistical  evidence  does  properly   demonstrate   a
    differential impact of some condition, it is for the respondent to show
    an objective justification, within the meaning  of  the  passages  from
    Hampson v DES and Barry v Midland Bank Plc set out above.   It  is  for
    the Tribunal to balance the justification advanced  by  the  respondent
    against the impact on the group of whom  the  appellant  is  a  member.
    Both sides of the balance are likely to be affected by the purpose  for
    which the appellant sought entry.

46. Fifthly (and no  less  important  than  the  preceding),  although  the
    decision-making process and analysis is the same  in  determining  race
    discrimination  in  this  Tribunal  as  it  is   for   race   and   sex
    discrimination  cases   in   employment   tribunals,   the   background
    circumstances and evidence are likely  to  be  widely  different.   The
    evidence before this Tribunal is rather unlikely  to  have  such  clear
    points of comparison between the treatment of different individuals  as
    may, for example, exist where the two individuals have been employed by
    the same employer.  This is of course  not  to  say  that  a  claim  of
    indirect or direct racial discrimination cannot be  made  out  in  this
    Tribunal; but it is important to  recognise  any  areas  in  which  the
    evidence adduced is not strictly comparable to that which has been  the
    subject of the  observations  in  the  authorities  to  which  we  have
    referred.

Conclusion

47. The appellant has failed  to  establish  direct  racial  discrimination
    against him.  He has failed to establish that the Immigration Rules  on
    working holidaymakers constitute indirect racial discrimination against
    Indians in general or him in particular.  He has  failed  to  establish
    that, at the date of the decision against which he appeals, he met  the
    requirements of those Rules.  On all the grounds he raised  his  appeal
    is dismissed.
