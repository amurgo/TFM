For the Appellant:     Ms C Jaquiss, counsel instructed by Farani Taylor
solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Jones, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of Miss Carla [B], who is a national of Bolivia born
    on 9 June 1983.  She arrived in the UK in September 2006 as  a  visitor
    and thereafter overstayed.  She made an application for leave to remain
    on the basis of her marriage to Mr [EV] on 13 February  2018  and  this
    application was refused in a decision dated 18 July 2018.

 2. The Appellant appealed against that decision and her appeal came before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Eldridge for hearing  on  22  February
    2019.  In a decision and reasons promulgated  on  14  March  2019,  the
    judge dismissed the appeal, finding that  although  the  Appellant  was
    effectively the mother of her husband's two children born on 4  January
    2002  and  19  February  2004  respectively,  that  the   interest   of
    immigration control outweighed the private interests of the family  and
    thus the decision was lawful and proportionate.

 3. Permission to appeal was sought in time on the basis that:

    (i)  The FTTJ at [31] accepted that the Appellant is for all  practical
         purposes now the mother of these two boys, their own mother  having
         given up any responsibility for them in practical terms many  years
         previously and in legal terms more recently with the signing of the
         power of attorney to that effect.

    (ii) On this accepted fact the concern of the FTT is then  whether  the
         Article  8  rights  of  any  of  the  family   members   would   be
         disproportionately affected by dismissing the appeal (Beoku-Betts).



    (iii)    At [12] of the determination the FTTJ notes that  one  of  the
         principal issues to the Article  8  assessment  is  whether  it  is
         proportionate for the two children to return to Bolivia and whether
         they were at a pivotal stage academically.

    (iv) Whilst the children are not qualifying children for  the  purposes
         of the Rules or statute, the  judge  quite  rightly  considers  the
         impact of dismissing the appeal on their best interests at [45]. It
         was submitted that the judge erred in his  application  of  the  EV
         (Philippines) principles [2014] EWCA Civ 874  at  [39]  finding  at
         [40] incorrectly that neither is in the immediate runup  to  public
         examinations whereas both boys are in fact well-established in  the
         course of undertaking GCSE and A-levels.

    (v)  It was further submitted that there were  contradictory  findings.
         At [45] the judge conclusively accepts "from the point of  view  of
         these two children they would continue  their  education  here  and
         live with their father and the  Appellant  in  a  safe  and  loving
         family unit.  It is probably in their best  interests  if  they  do
         so".  Thus the only possible rational outcome for a proportionality
         assessment was to allow the appeal.

    (vi) It was further submitted that the Tribunal's conclusion at [47] is
         inadequately reasoned and irrational for this reason.  All the more
         so given that the judge  accepted  at  [46]  that  this  is  not  a
         Chikwamba case and it could  not  be  said  entry  clearance  would
         definitely be granted. Consequently the  decision  to  dismiss  the
         appeal disproportionately breached the family life  rights  of  the
         Appellant and her stepsons.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Gumsley
    on the basis:

         "I am satisfied that it is arguable that the judge  erred  in  law.
         In light of the findings of the judge at [31] [32]  [38]  [45]  and
         [47] it is arguable that the judge's proportionality assessment was
         flawed, that the judge's decision was irrational  and/or  that  the
         reasons for the decision were inadequate."

 5. A Rule 24 response was submitted, dated 14 June  2019,  which  asserted
    that the grounds amounted to no  more  than  a  disagreement  with  the
    judge's findings of fact and that in essence  that  the  Appellant  was
    choosing where to conduct family life.

    Hearing

 6. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal, Ms Jaquiss on behalf  of  the
    Appellant sought to adduce evidence that had been handed in on the  day
    of the hearing from the children's schools. This shows that the younger
    child G, was due to take his religious education  GCSE  this  year  and
    that the older stepson E, was in the first year of his  A-levels.   She
    pointed out that at [17] of the First  tier  Tribunal's  decision,  the
    Presenting Officer in the First-tier Tribunal accepted that  they  were
    on the approach to public examinations.   Ms  Jaquiss  submitted  that,
    essentially, it was the Appellant's case that the judge  had  erred  in
    finding the children were not at a pivotal stage  of  their  education.
    At [40] the judge held "Neither is in the immediate  run-up  to  public
    examinations but they are each of them well into the first of  the  two
    years before  their  GCSEs  or  A-levels.   Both  have  aspirations  of
    attending university here".

 7. Ms Jaquiss submitted that the  judge  had  further  made  contradictory
    findings in that at [45] he made the finding it was probably  in  their
    best interests to continue their education in the UK and to  live  with
    their father and the Appellant; and that the conclusion to the contrary
    at [47] that the interests of immigration control outweigh the  private
    interests of his family were inadequately reasoned  and  irrational  in
    light of the fact that that conclusion was contrary to what  the  judge
    had found would be in the children's best interests.

 8. In her submissions, Ms Jones invited me to read the whole of  [40]  and
    the judge's consideration there of EV (Philippines).  The  judge  there
    held "As with the two boys  here,  the  children  in  EV  were  neither
    British citizens nor settled nor had they been in this country  for  at
    least seven years". Pausing there, it became apparent that that  was  a
    material  error  of  fact  as  the  Appellant's  stepsons  were   given
    indefinite leave to enter the UK when they arrived in 2016.   Thus  the
    judge erred in fact in finding that the two boys are not settled.   She
    submitted that the children had lived most of their lives  in  Bolivia:
    see [31], [41] and [47], and that most of  their  education  had  taken
    place there. She submitted that there was no material error of  law  as
    the judge had taken into account the relevant factors and that this was
    not a case where the children had resided in the UK  for  seven  years;
    they were not qualifying children and had only been in the  UK  for  30
    months at that time.

 9. In reply, Ms Jaquiss said the appeal was heard on 22 February 2019  and
    G had his first exam on 13 May 2019. This was only a matter  of  months
    and so it could properly be termed as being in the immediate run-up  to
    important public examinations.  She accepted that the findings  of  the
    judge in relation to the children's history in  Bolivia  had  not  been
    challenged and that none of the links to any family  in  Bolivia  would
    assist the boys in terms of mitigating the effect of disruption of  not
    being able to take those important public examinations.




    Findings and Reasons on the error of law

10. I found material errors of  law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge for the reasons set out in the grounds of appeal and  in
    light of what I find to be a material error of fact at [40] in relation
    to the immigration status of the Appellant's stepsons.  It  was  agreed
    that the decision could be remade in the  Upper  Tribunal  without  the
    need for further oral evidence, in light of  the  evidence  before  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  and  an  additional  supplementary  bundle  which
    includes, amongst other things, applications for naturalisation made on
    behalf of the two stepsons, who  have  now  completed  the  three  year
    qualifying period to render them eligible for British citizenship.

    Re-making

11. In her submissions, Ms Jones pointed out that the presidential decision
    in JG (s 117B(6): "reasonable to leave" UK) Turkey  [2019]  UKUT  00072
    (IAC) remains the current position in law.  She noted the children  had
    applied for naturalisation however the decision in ZH (Tanzania) [2011]
    UKSC 4 was not a trump card, albeit their best interests were clearly a
    primary consideration.  She submitted  that  little  weight  should  be
    given  to  the  Appellant's  private  life  because  she   formed   her
    relationship with her husband at a time when she did not have leave  to
    remain.  However she was not  pressing  that  issue  in  light  of  the
    current jurisprudence.  She invited me to dismiss the appeal.

12. In her submissions, Ms Jaquiss sought to rely on her skeleton argument,
    which is dated 25 June 2019. However, this does not make  reference  to
    the decision in JG (op cit) because they are not  qualifying  children.
    In relation to the weight to be attached  to  the  Appellant's  private
    life, she sought to rely on  the  judgment  of  the  Supreme  Court  in
    Rhuppiah [2018]  UKSC  58  with  the  reference  there  to  flexibility
    regarding section 117B(4) of the  NIAA  2002  at  [99]  to  [100].  She
    submitted that the jurisprudence, cf. EV (Philippines) [2014] EWCA  Civ
    874 and Azimi-Moayed [2013] UKUT 00197 (IAC) made clear that the  stage
    of education reached by children who are  affected  is  relevant.   She
    submitted that the Appellant's stepsons were now at a pivotal stage  in
    their education. The Appellant is to all  intents  and  purposes  their
    mother. There is now a power of attorney to that effect at pages 42  to
    49 of the Appellant's bundle. The children were previously  brought  up
    by their paternal grandparents, their  biological  mother  having  been
    absent from their lives for a very long time. In terms of  the  current
    family set up, the Appellant stays at home and looks after the children
    whilst their father works. This is clear from the witness statement  of
    her husband at [18] of page  15.  There  was  also  evidence  from  the
    Appellant's two stepsons at pages 70 to 71 who state that the Appellant
    has been like a mother to them since  they  came  to  London.  She  has
    always been there for them and she was the person to whom  the  younger
    child turned to when he was mugged.

13. Ms Jaquiss submitted that the children have both made  applications  to
    register as British citizens. There is no reason to  doubt  that  those
    applications will not be granted.  She submitted it was  also  relevant
    to the proportionality balancing exercise that the Appellant's  husband
    earns over the minimum income requirement and this is made  clear  from
    pages 9 to 41 of the supplementary bundle.  He now has his own cleaning
    business as well as being employed and his  combined  projected  income
    was �23,646. This is  projected  because  he  only  started  his  self-
    employment at the beginning of 2009.  She invited me to find  that  the
    balance falls in favour of the Appellant and to allow the appeal.

    Findings and reasons

14. The basis of the refusal decision  dated  18  July  2018  is  that  the
    Appellant's stepsons are not  qualifying  children  and  there  are  no
    insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  Appellant's  husband  returning  to
    Bolivia: EX1(a) and (b) of Appendix FM. It was not considered that  the
    Appellant met the requirements of paragraph 276ADE  of  the  Rules  nor
    that there were exceptional circumstances meriting the grant  of  leave
    outside the Rules.

15. In light of the fact that  the  Appellant  is  an  overstayer  and  her
    stepsons are not, as yet, qualifying children,  it  was  not  contended
    that the Appellant is able to meet the requirements of the Appendix  FM
    of  the  Immigration  Rules.  Thus  the  issue  is  whether  there  are
    exceptional circumstances, which  would  render  refusal  a  breach  of
    Article 8 because it would result in unjustifiably  harsh  consequences
    for the Appellant, her husband and stepsons. It is  not  disputed  that
    there is a shared family life and that the  Appellant  has  a  parental
    relationship with her stepsons.

16. Given that this is a human rights appeal, the relevant date is the date
    of hearing before the Upper Tribunal. At that time it was apparent that
    there had been a  change  in  circumstances  in  that  the  Appellant's
    stepsons have on 11 June 2019 made  applications  for  registration  as
    British citizens. Whilst no  decision  had  yet  been  reached  by  the
    Respondent  in  respect  of  these  applications,  Ms  Jones  took  the
    pragmatic position that, in the absence  of  any  known  countervailing
    circumstances, it was likely that the applications would be granted and
    that, in  light  of  the  current  jurisprudence  cf.  JG  (s  117B(6):
    "reasonable to leave" UK) Turkey [2019] UKUT  00072  (IAC)  the  appeal
    would fall to be allowed. However, the position at the date of  hearing
    is that the Appellant's stepsons are not, as yet, British citizens.

17. The focus of the submissions by Ms Jacquiss was  that  the  Appellant's
    stepsons are at a pivotal stage in their education in that  G  is  half
    way through his GCSE course and is due to take his  GCSEs  next  Spring
    and early Summer and has already taken a GCSE in Religious Education. E
    is half way through his A level course and is due to take his A  levels
    next Spring and early Summer. Further, E has had  offers  to  study  at
    British Universities.

18. In EV (Philippines) [2014 EWCA Civ 874 the Court  of  Appeal  per  Lord
    Justice Christopher Clarke held  at  [36]  that  one  of  the  material
    factors in the assessment of proportionality is "the more advanced  (or
    critical) the stage of his education ... and the more  deleterious  the
    consequences of his return, the greater the weight that falls into  one
    side of the scales."

19. Clearly, whilst both boys have only resided in the United  Kingdom  and
    have been pursuing their education here since October 2016, it would be
    very disruptive for them to have to leave  at  this  particular  stage,
    prior to completing their respective exams. I find it would be contrary
    to their best interests for them to leave the United Kingdom.

20. I have gone on to consider whether it would be proportionate or whether
    it would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for this family  if
    the Appellant were required to return to Bolivia  to  apply  for  entry
    clearance to return as a partner. The Respondent  did  not  take  issue
    with the Appellant's ability to meet the  suitability  and  eligibility
    requirements of the Rules in the refusal decision, however, it was  the
    case at the First  tier  Tribunal  hearing  that  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE have not  been  shown  to  be  met  in  respect  of  the
    documentary evidence of the Sponsor's self-employment.

21. The Appellant now seeks to rely on a supplementary bundle of  evidence,
    which shows that he earned �16,146 as an employee in four cleaning jobs
    during the last tax year from April 2018 to April 2019 and that he also
    commenced self-employment in January 2019. The employed taxable  income
    is evidenced by HMRC documentation at pages 9-10, a P60 at page 11  and
    payslips at  pages  12-21.  There  are  also  invoices  for  his  self-
    employment cleaning services at page 22, �720 dated 10.2.19; �680 dated
    10.3.19; �650 dated 10.4.19 and �650 dated 10.6.19 and  a  letter  from
    John Martin There is also a letter from  Christian  Lewis,  accountant,
    dated 17 June 2019 stating that his estimated income for  the  year  is
    �7500 and that they are due to complete his tax returns by  31  January
    2020. However, in terms of the last tax year, on  the  evidence  before
    the Upper Tribunal, the Sponsor's income is �16,146 employment  plus  2
    months income in self-employment of �720 and �680 is �17,546, which  is
    under the minimum income requirement.

22. However, I am prepared to accept that it is reasonably likely that  the
    Sponsor will meet the minimum income requirement for  the  current  tax
    year from April 2019, if his self-employment and employed income remain
    the same. However, he cannot currently meet the specified  requirements
    set out in Appendix  FM  SE,  or  the  minimum  income  requirement  in
    relation to the past tax year which I find means that  any  application
    for entry clearance would be likely to be  refused  until  after  April
    2020 or until such time that the Sponsor is able to demonstrate that he
    meets the requirements of the Rules and Appendix FM SE.

23. I have also taken account of the public interest considerations set out
    in section 117B of  the  NIAA  2002.  The  First  tier  Tribunal  Judge
    accepted that the Appellant speaks English and that she is  financially
    independent, through her husband but that these are neutral factors. It
    is the case and I find that she developed  her  relationship  with  her
    husband at a time when she was residing unlawfully  in  the  UK  as  an
    overstayer. As to section  117B(6),  her  stepsons  are  not  currently
    qualifying children, however, it would be artificial to  fail  to  take
    into consideration the fact that they have applied for registration  as
    British citizens and thus are likely to very shortly become  qualifying
    children. I have already found that it  would  not  be  in  their  best
    interests to leave the United Kingdom given the stage they have reached
    in their education. I further find in light of the evidence  that  such
    applications have been made, that it would not be reasonable to  expect
    them to leave.

24. It follows in light of my  finding  above,  following  JG  (s  117B(6):
    "reasonable to leave" UK) Turkey [2019] UKUT 00072 (IAC)  which  itself
    follows the judgments in MA (Pakistan) & Ors v  Upper  Tribunal [2016]
    EWCA Civ 705 and KO (Nigeria) & Ors v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2018] UKSC 53 that the Appellant's appeal succeeds because
    the public interest does not require her removal.

Notice of Decision

I find material errors of law in the decision of First tier  Tribunal  Judge
Eldridge. I set that decision aside and re-make the decision. The appeal  is
allowed on human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
