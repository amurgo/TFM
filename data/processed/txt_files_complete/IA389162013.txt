Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Shilliday, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal with the leave of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Shimmin.
    When granting permission to appeal he  noted  that  the  appellant  was
    seeking permission to appeal (in time)  against  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Prior), who in a decision promulgated on  11
    September 2014 dismissed the appellant's appeal against  the  Secretary
    of State's decision  to  refuse  him  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  Judge Shimmin noted that the grounds of appeal
    argued that the First-tier Tribunal  judge  erred,  first  of  all,  in
    misdirecting himself as to  the  admissibility  of  evidence.   Pausing
    there, it is frankly accepted by Mr  Shilliday  for  the  Secretary  of
    State that the judge did err in this respect, but there is an issue  as
    to whether that error is material for reasons which we will explain.

 2. The second error, it was said, was that the First-tier  Tribunal  judge
    misdirected himself about the operation of the  evidential  flexibility
    policy. First-tier Tribunal Judge Shimmin said  that  it  was  arguable
    that the judge had misdirected himself in respect of the evidence which
    was admissible, but all grounds of appeal were to  remain  open.  There
    was an arguable error of law.

 3. We take the facts from paragraph 2 of the determination of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

 4. The appellant was born on 3 April 1981, is male, and a national of  Sri
    Lanka.  He first entered the United Kingdom on 25 September 2006  on  a
    student visa, obtained extensions of his leave and was finally granted,
    on 20 July 2011, leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1
    (Post-Study) Migrant until 20 July 2013.  On 18 July 2013 the appellant
    made an application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier
    1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the points-based system, or  PBS.   That
    application was refused on 6 September 2013, and a decision was made to
    remove the appellant from the United Kingdom.  He duly  appealed  under
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 5. The relevant paragraph  of  the  Immigration  Rules  ("the  Rules")  is
    paragraph 245DD. Its requirements include a requirement which  I  shall
    refer to generically as 'access to funds.'  The  appellant's  case  was
    that he had access to funds made available  by  Maristela  Bibiyan  and
    Paramakurusamy Thuraiselvam, which were held in the Pan Asia Bank.  The
    documents which he supplied with his application were a letter from the
    Pan Asia Bank addressed to the Visa Officer dated 10 July 2013 headed:

         "Confirmation of balance as at 9 July 2013
          Mr Paramakurusamy Thuraiselvam

         At the request of the above client, we hereby confirm that  he  has
         been maintaining the following fixed deposits with  our  Wellawatte
         Branch. (Details were then set out).

          We  also  confirm  that  the  above  fixed  deposits  have   been
         maintaining jointly with Mrs  Maristela  Bibiyan  Thuraiselvam  and
         further confirm that there are no credit facilities  against  these
         deposits and they can  be  withdrawn  at  any  time  prior  to  the
         maturity date subject to a lower rate of interest."

 6. He also supplied a document addressed to The Home Office from Maristela
    Bibiyan, with her address, dated 12 July 2013:

         "Dear Sir/Madam

         Declaration from Third Party Sponsor

         I, Maristela Bibiyan [and she gave her address] do  hereby  declare
         that I have in  my  personal  bank  account  at  Pan  Asia  Banking
         Corporation P.L.C. Wellawatte Branch fixed  deposits  amounting  to
         �81,000 jointly with my husband Paramagurusamy Thuraiselvam as at 9
         July 2013.  I have with the consent of my  husband  made  available
         and disposable a sum of �50,000 to Mr  Arunthavaselvam  Balatheepan
         to invest in his business activities in the United Kingdom.

         Please contact me if you need any further information"

    and then a further document  headed:  Ram  Balasubramaniyam  (with  his
    address), Solicitor & Attorney at Law, also dated 12 July:

         "To whom it may concern

         I have known Maristela Bibiyan [and he gave her address]  for  over
         twenty years.  She has in her personal bank  account  at  Pan  Asia
         Banking  Corporation  P.L.C.  Wellawatte  Branch   fixed   deposits
         amounting to  �81,000  jointly  with  her  husband,  Paramagurusamy
         Thuraiselvam.  I am aware that she has  with  the  consent  of  her
         husband made available and  disposable  a  sum  of  �50,000  to  Mr
         Arunthavaselvam Balatheepan to invest in his business activities in
         the United Kingdom."

 7. The appellant also provided a  three-page  printout  from  his  website
    headed "Selvam Consultancy". One page was headed "Service". The  second
    page was headed "About Us". The third page gave his contact details.

 8. In the reasons for refusing the  application  the  Secretary  of  State
    referred first of all under the heading "Access to Funds" to the  funds
    held in the Pan Asia Bank. The  Secretary of State listed the materials
    that had been provided and went on to say:

         "The Immigration Rules state:

         41-SD    The specified documents in Table 4 and paragraph 41 are as
               follows:

           (a)    The specified documents to show  evidence  of  the  money
               available to  invest  are  one  or  more  of  the  following
               specified documents:

               (1)    A letter from each financial institution holding  the
                    funds to confirm the amount of money  available  to  the
                    applicant:

                     . each letter must be an original document  and  not  a
                       copy;

                       . be on the institution's official headed paper;

                     . been authorised by an official of that institution;

                     . have been produced within  three  months  immediately
                       before the date of the application;

                     . confirm that the  institution  is  regulated  by  the
                       appropriate body;

                     . state the applicant's name;

                     . state the date of the document;

                     . confirm the amount of money from the applicant's  own
                       funds;

                     . confirm the amount of money provided to the applicant
                       from any third party (if applicable) that is held  in
                       that institution;

                     . confirm the  name  of  each  third  party  and  their
                       contact  details,  including   their   full   address
                       including postal  code,  landline  number  and  email
                       address, and

                     . confirm that if the money is not  in  an  institution
                       regulated by the FSA, the money  can  be  transferred
                       into the UK."

    The Secretary of State continued:

         "The documents you have submitted do not meet  the  above  criteria
         for the reasons stipulated below:

             'The letter from the Pan Asia Bank does not name  you  as  the
             recipient of the third party funds.  It also  does  not  state
             the funds are available for use in the UK .....and it is plain
             from our reading of the document from the Pan Asia  Bank  that
             it does not comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  relevant
             paragraph of the Rules'."

    The Secretary of State then said, quoting the relevant paragraph of the
    Rules:

         "If the applicant is applying using money from  a  third  party  he
         must provide all of the following specified documents:

         (1)  An original declaration from every third party that they  have
             made the money available for the  applicant  to  invest  in  a
             business in the  United  Kingdom  containing  various  details
             including -

                . the name of the third party and the applicant

                . the date of the declaration, and so on, and

                . the relationship of the third party to the applicant."

 9. Now it is apparent if one goes back to the declaration from  the  third
    party, the declaration  from  Maristela  Bibiyan,  that  that  did  not
    contain any description of her relationship with the appellant  and  it
    is also  apparent  that  there  was  no  declaration  at  all  from  Mr
    Paramakurusamy Thuraiselvam. So it seems to us that in  both  of  those
    respects  the  material  supplied  was  not  in  conformity  with   the
    requirements of the Rules.

10.  Finally,  the  Secretary  of  State  on  this  aspect  turned  to  the
    requirements  of  the  letter  from  the  legal  representative.    The
    Secretary of State set out the requirements in the Rules and said:

         "The document you have provided from the  legal  representative  is
         not acceptable for the following reasons:

           . It does not  contain  your  signature  or  the  signatures  of
             Marisela Bibiyan and Paramagurusamy Thuraiselvam;

           . It does not contain the contact details of the two sponsors;

           . It does not state the relationship between you and  the  third
             parties"

    Those criticisms, for what it is worth, are also made out. However,  as
    the First-tier Tribunal pointed out in its determination, at  paragraph
    14, these are not the requirements set out in the  relevant  paragraphs
    of Appendix A to the  Rules.  We  observe,  parenthetically,  that  the
    requirements in the relevant paragraphs of Appendix A were not in  fact
    met by the declaration from the legal representative.

11. Finally, the Secretary of State referred  to  the  print-out  from  the
    website and made the  point  that  no  advertising  material  had  been
    provided in support of the application, only a  print-out  of  the  web
    page, and it seems to us again on the proper construction of  the  Rule
    that that was the right.  A website by itself it seems  to  us  is  not
    marketing material or advertising that has been  published  locally  or
    nationally.

12. The First-tier Tribunal dealt  with  the  case  in  a  fairly  succinct
    manner.  It is true, as Mr  Shilliday  conceded,  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did  appear  to  misdirect  itself  about  what  evidence  was
    admissible on the appeal (in paragraph 17 of  the  determination).   At
    paragraph 16 the First-tier Tribunal made the point that it was not the
    appellant's case that his application, which he had made without  legal
    advice, met the requirements of the Rules. This is a reflection  of  an
    important  and,  in  our  judgment,  accurate  concession   about   the
    application.  The Appellant argued that the  respondent,  that  is  the
    Secretary of State, had failed to exercise  evidential  flexibility  as
    required by published guidance and he thus failed to act in  accordance
    with the law.

13. The Tribunal  then  referred  to  the  points-based  system  evidential
    flexibility guidance, a copy of which we have been given, and made  the
    point that the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant could rely
    on the guidance.  The Tribunal then quoted a passage from the guidance:

         "Under the evidential flexibility process if there are minor errors
         or omissions on a valid application but there is enough evidence to
         show the application would otherwise be granted,  you  may  contact
         the migrant to request missing documents and/or information."

14. In our judgment the defects in this application  were  such  that  they
    could not be described as minor problems or  omissions.   The  guidance
    gives examples such as documents, for example -

       . bank statements which are missing from a series;

       . evidence detailed on a Confirmation of Acceptance  for  Studies  or
         Certificate of Sponsorship which is missing;

       . photocopies of required documents have been received or a  document
         is in the wrong format.

15. It seems to us that on the  proper  construction  of  this  policy  the
    defects in this application were  not  such  as  to  fall  within  this
    guidance.  They were more fundamental. There was  not  enough  material
    submitted with the application to show that the application  was  going
    to succeed. Nor could it be inferred from the material  that  had  been
    submitted that it would succeed.  Many matters had been left out and it
    could not be inferred from what  was  submitted  that  the  application
    would succeed.

16. For those reasons therefore although we do not agree with the  analysis
    of the First-tier Tribunal in all respects, it seems  to  us  that  any
    errors of law were immaterial. This appeal must be dismissed.
