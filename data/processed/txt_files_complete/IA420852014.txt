For the Appellant:     Miss Nasim - Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr Staunton - Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by Pardeep  Singh,  a  citizen  of  India  born  11th
    January 1975.  He appeals against the decision of the  Respondent  made
    on 30th September 2014 to remove him  from  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    Appellant's appeal against that  decision  was  allowed  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Maka and the reasons for that  set  out  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 18th June 2015.  The Secretary of State appealed against
    the decision of Judge Maka and on  19th  December  2015,  having  heard
    submissions I found that there was a  material  error  of  law  in  the
    determination of Judge Maka and  I  set  his  decision  aside  with  no
    preserved findings of fact.

 2. The facts of the case are that the Appellant claims to have arrived  in
    the UK on 2nd February 1997.  He sought asylum on 13th  February  1997
    and this claim was refused on 10th April 1997.  He was  arrested  three
    times, on 14th March 2011, 24th January 2013 and 25th January 2013 for
    driving without a licence and with no insurance.  On 25th March 2013 he
    was detained for a period at IRC Morton  Hall.   He  had  made  further
    representations on 29th January 2013 then on 8th  July  2014  and  19th
    September 2014 asked for his case to be reconsidered.   Following  that
    the Respondent, having refused his application on 30th September  2014,
    issued removal directions.  It is the appeal against that decision that
    is before me today.

 3. The Appellant has apparently done odd jobs as  a  labourer  during  his
    time in the UK.  He has  no  national  insurance  number  and  no  bank
    account.  He is registered with a GP.  He has been  in  a  relationship
    with his partner, Darshana Pall, a British citizen since 2002.  She has
    adult  children.   She  also  has  some  medical  conditions  including
    diabetes and problems with her shoulders. She has had  surgery  on  one
    shoulder and expects to have surgery on the other.  The  Appellant  has
    been in the UK for almost nineteen years.  He has never had leave to be
    here.

 4. The Secretary of State in  refusing  the  application  found  that  the
    Appellant  meets  the  suitability  and  eligibility  requirements  for
    limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a partner as  set  out
    in Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules.   She  went  on  to  consider
    whether the requirements of paragraph EX.1. of  Appendix  FM  are  met.
    EX.1(b) states that:

         "This paragraph applies if -

           (b)    The applicant has a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
             with a partner who is in the UK  and  is  a  British  citizen,
             settled in  the  UK  or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or
             humanitarian  protection,   and   there   are insurmountable
             obstacles to family life with that partner continuing  outside
             the UK."

 5. This is followed by EX.2. which states:

         "For the purposes of paragraph EX.1.(b) 'insurmountable  obstacles'
         means the very significant difficulties which would be faced by the
         applicant or their partner in continuing their family life together
         outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail very
         serious hardship for the applicant or their partner."

 6. The Secretary of State concluded that the requirements of EX.1. are not
    met because whilst she accepted that the Appellant does have a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship with his partner who is a  British  citizen
    no evidence had been provided to show that Mrs Pall could not return to
    India if necessary.  She was born in India and is likely to be familiar
    with the language and culture of that country.  The Secretary of  State
    accepted that it may be initially difficult for the Appellant's partner
    to relocate but  said  there  is  no  evidence  of  any  insurmountable
    obstacles.  She would have the support of the Appellant who  has  lived
    in India for the majority of his life.  He would be able to work there.



 7. The Secretary of State went on to consider whether the Appellant  meets
    the requirements of paragraph 276ADE (1) of the Immigration Rules.  The
    only provisions that could  possibly  assist  the  Appellant  are  sub-
    paragraphs (iii) and (vi). Sub-paragraph (iii) requires that  in  order
    to be granted leave to remain in the UK on the basis of private life in
    the UK an applicant must show that at the date of  application  he  has
    been in the  UK  for  20  years.  The  Appellant  does  not  meet  this
    provision.   Sub-paragraph  (vi)  provides  that  an   applicant   must
    establish that  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
    integration into the country to which he would  be  returned,  in  this
    case, India.  The Secretary of State does not accept that  there  would
    be very significant obstacles, saying that  the  Appellant  had   lived
    most of his life in India and has social  and  cultural  ties  to  that
    country.  He has not established otherwise.

 8. The  Secretary  of  State  considered  whether  there  are  exceptional
    circumstances which would warrant a right to remain in the  UK  outwith
    the Rules but concluded that there are no such circumstances.

 9. I have a large  bundle  of  documents  including  statements  from  the
    Appellant and from his partner, Darshana Pall.

10.  The Appellant states that he has been here  since  1996  and  has  not
    returned to India in the interim.  The asylum claim he made in 1997 was
    refused.  An application was made for leave to remain on the  basis  of
    his relationship with Darshana Pall and a further application was  made
    for his case to be considered under the Legacy Scheme.  He did complete
    a legacy questionnaire and sent it back to the Home  Office,  receiving
    an acknowledgement on 13th October 2007.  He  has  heard  nothing  else
    although his solicitors wrote several reminders to the Home Office.  He
    started his relationship in March 2002 and he and Mrs  Pall  have  been
    living together since then as husband and wife.  He said  he  does  not
    understand why his case  has  been  refused  under  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and  Fundamental
    Freedoms.  He has established a private and family life during his stay
    of nineteen years.  He has no ties to India.   His  partner  has  three
    children from a previous relationship, two daughters and  a  son.   She
    has a grandson too.  The children all live in the UK  and  are  settled
    here.  He is very attached to the children and has a good  relationship
    with them all.  He would not want to leave them.  They live as a proper
    family.  His partner's daughter recently married and that was  a  proud
    moment for him.  He says they cannot return  to  India  and  leave  the
    children behind because they love them and are close to them.  It is  a
    big step.  He and his partner would have difficulty finding  work.   He
    says that considering their age they would not manage  very  well.   He
    has provided letters from friends supporting his application to remain.



11. In her statement Darshana Rani Pall confirms  that  she  is  a  British
    citizen and that she and the Appellant  have  been  in  a  relationship
    since March  2002  living  as  husband  and  wife.   She  confirms  his
    closeness to her children.  She says he has no-one in India and no ties
    to that country.  She does not consider it reasonable for the Secretary
    of State to suggest that the Appellant can return to India where he has
    nothing and no family.  He has not kept in touch with anyone there.  It
    is harsh and unfair to suggest that she can move  to  India  with  him.
    Her place is here with her family.  She  cannot  imagine  life  without
    him.  He has been here for nearly twenty years.

12.  There  are  statements  from  family  and   friends   confirming   the
    relationship.  There  are  copies  of  letters  from  the   Appellant's
    representative chasing up the application under the Legacy Scheme.

13. I heard oral evidence from the Appellant and from his partner.

14. I should say at this point that at the start of the hearing Miss  Nasim
    requested an adjournment.  She told me that the Court of Appeal are  in
    the process of dealing with a case which will  define  "insurmountable"
    as it applies in paragraph EX.1. of Appendix FM.  She handed  to  me  a
    decision  Agyarko  and  Others  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2015] EWCA Civ 440.  In that case the First  Appellant  and
    the Third  Appellant  had  commenced  judicial  review  proceedings  to
    challenge the decision of the Secretary of State  to  refuse  leave  to
    remain on human rights  grounds.   In  each  case  the  Upper  Tribunal
    refused to grant permission to seek judicial review so  the  Appellants
    applied to the Court of Appeal.  Miss Nasim pointed out that the  Court
    of Appeal had  said  at  paragraph  23  that  although  "insurmountable
    obstacles" involves a stringent test it is obviously intended  in  both
    the case law and  the  Rules  to  be  interpreted  in  a  sensible  and
    practical rather than a purely literal way.  They went  on  to  say  in
    paragraph 24 that in the context of making a wider Article 8 assessment
    outside the Rules it is a factor to  be  taken  into  account,  not  an
    absolute requirement that has to be  satisfied  in  every  single  case
    across the whole range of cases covered by Article  8.   The  Court  of
    Appeal found that the Secretary of State's assessment that  there  were
    no insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing  outside  the  UK
    could not be said to  be  irrational  or  unlawful  in  any  way.   The
    submissions of Miss Nasim were not at all clear and I can  see  nothing
    in the decision which she presented to me that would suggest that  what
    the Court of Appeal intend to do is to provide a decision setting out a
    standard definition of "insurmountable obstacles".  Miss  Nasim  and  I
    indeed had a considerable discussion about this.  She  appeared  to  be
    hopeful that the Court of Appeal would provide a decision  setting  out
    perhaps  a  list  of  things  that  would  constitute   "insurmountable
    obstacles".  She wanted me to adjourn this case pending  the  issue  of
    the substantive decision.  I  am  far  from  satisfied  that  any  such
    decision would assist the appeal before me but in any event it  is  not
    the practice of this Tribunal to stay cases pending decisions  of  this
    Tribunal or a higher court except in very exceptional circumstances.

15. The Appellant gave evidence  in  Punjabi  with  the  assistance  of  an
    interpreter.  He adopted his statement.  He spoke of the  problems  his
    wife has with her shoulder and his relationship with his  stepchildren.
    I have to say that he did indeed say that he had three children in this
    country and  a  grandchild  which  is  not  the  case.   They  are  his
    stepchildren and it was only when he was pressed that he conceded this.
    The children are all adults.  He said his  wife's  daughter  could  not
    help her at home because she works.  He confirmed  that  his  wife  had
    visited India for  two  weeks  in  January  2015  visiting  family  and
    attending a traditional religious ceremony for their grandson.  She has
    a brother living there.  She is not working at the moment.

16. Darshana Rani Pall adopted her statement.  She said her  family  is  in
    the UK. She would have nowhere to live in India.   She  was  asked  how
    they support themselves and said that her children  are  working.   She
    has applied for Jobseekers  Allowance.   She  said  she  does  not  get
    housing benefit but the evidence they ultimately gave  about  the  home
    they live in was not at all clear.  It seems that she and her  daughter
    bought the house that she lives in, in their joint names.  Ms Pall  had
    said initially that the house was rented from the Council and that  the
    rent was just over �20.  She could not say whether this was per week or
    per month.  It was extremely difficult to get any information from  her
    at  all  about  their  financial  circumstances.   She  said  her   son
    "sometimes" gives her �100 a week.  Her daughter helps  with  the  rent
    and buys some shopping.  Her younger daughter pays the  monthly  bills.
    I did ask Mrs Pall why the rent was so low and it was  at  that  point
    that she said she and her  daughter  had  bought  the  house  from  the
    Council.  Initially she said it was �200.000 then she said they  bought
    it four of five years ago for the discounted price of �40,000  and  her
    children contributed to this.  In re-examination she confirmed to  Miss
    Nasim that the rent she spoke of is actually ground rent.  I asked  her
    if she has any family in India and she said that she has a brother  and
    sister.  I followed that up with a question as to whether  or  not  she
    has any nieces and nephews and she said that she does.

17. In his submissions Mr Staunton  said  he  would  rely  on  the  refusal
    letter.  He submitted that there are no insurmountable obstacles to the
    Appellant's partner going to live in India  with  him.   The  Appellant
    does not work.  His partner does not work.  They have no  income.   His
    family who are supporting them here could support them in India.   With
    regard to paragraph 117B(vi) he pointed out that   the  Appellant  gave
    evidence in Punjabi.  He has not integrated here.  He has no  financial
    independence here.  There is nothing to prevent him returning to India.



18. In her submissions Miss Nasim said that the relationship is accepted as
    genuine.  The Appellant has been here for nineteen years.  He has tried
    to stay in touch with the Home Office.  His partner has medical issues.
     They are supported by their children.  The Appellant's  partner  looks
    after her grandchild.

My Findings

19. I have given careful consideration to all the evidence put before me in
    this case.

20. The question is whether  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    Appellant's partner returning to India  with  the  Appellant.   I  also
    consider  paragraph  276ADE,  paragraph  117B   of   the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and Article 8 ECHR.

21.  I would say too that I accept that the  Appellant  applied  under  the
    Legacy Scheme but I do not accept that this adds weight to  his  appeal
    against the refusal of leave to remain.  In saying this I rely  on  the
    decision AZ (Asylum - "legacy" cases) Afghanistan [2013]  UKUT  270  in
    which the Tribunal said that where an appellant in an asylum appeal had
    previously been informed that his case is being considered as a 'legacy
    case' but no decision under that process had been  made,  a  subsequent
    immigration decision is not rendered unlawful by reason of the  failure
    to make a decision under the Legacy Scheme.

22. With regard to EX.1. I do not  accept  that  there  are  insurmountable
    obstacles to the Appellant's wife going to India with him,  bearing  in
    mind the guidance on the interpretation of  "insurmountable  obstacles"
    set out at paragraph EX.2.  I accept that she has health  problems  but
    these are not problems that would not be treatable in  India  and  they
    are not problems which would prevent her moving to India and setting up
    home there with her partner.  I accept that she has a family in the  UK
    and that it would be very difficult for her to leave  them  and  go  to
    live in India.  I accept that she has a  grandchild  and  it  would  be
    particularly hard to leave the child behind.  The fact of the matter is
    however is that she has been in a relationship with the Appellant for a
    number of years fully in the knowledge that he did not have  any  leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom.  He did makes  applications  but  this
    does not mean that they should not at some point  have  considered  the
    possibility that he might  be  asked  to  leave  the  country  and  the
    possibility that she may have to consider going to India with him.  She
    is a British citizen and of course has a right to  remain  in  the  UK.
    When  two  people  of  different  nationalities  decide  to   enter   a
    relationship or marry it seems to me to be unavoidable  that  there  is
    some discussion at some point about where they are  going  to  exercise
    their family life together.   The  Appellant's  partner  is  of  Indian
    origin.  She speaks fluent Punjabi.  She still has family in India.   I
    have to say that it was clear that she did not want to admit  that  she
    had family in India but eventually admitted that she does  indeed  have
    siblings and nieces and nephews.  In these circumstances it  cannot  in
    my view be said that there are insurmountable obstacles to  her  living
    there.  Her family are supporting her.   They could continue to do  so.
    She has worked in the past.  It is stated in the Appellant's  statement
    that he would have difficulty getting work in India.  He refers to "our
    ages" but he is only 40 years old and I do not accept that he would not
    be able to get work to support his partner.  I do not accept that  they
    would suffer very serious hardship if they were to move to India  where
    they clearly have family support.

23. With regard to paragraph 276ADE I accept that the  Appellant  has  been
    here for nearly twenty years but he has not been here for twenty  years
    yet and certainly had not been at the date of the application. I cannot
    allow an appeal under the Rules on the basis of a 'near mss'.

24. With regard to paragraph 276ADE(vi) I rely on  the points I made  above
    about his partner.  I accept that he has a family  life  here  but  his
    stepchildren are all adults and have their own independent  lives.  His
    partner has made visits to  India  and  there  is  no  reason  why  her
    children cannot do this. I take into account that the Appellant is of

25. Indian origin.  He speaks Punjabi as does his partner.  He  spent  most
    of his life in India and his partner has family there.   I think it  is
    possible that he has not been candid about what family he has there but
    that is of no real import.  He is a relatively young man who I  believe
    could work in India and have a satisfactory life there.   There  is  no
    evidence of any  very significant obstacles  to him making  a  life  in
    India and integrating there

26. I turn to Article 8 ECHR.  It was stated in Razgar v Secretary of State
    [2004] UKHL 27  that there are  5  questions  that  must  be  asked  in
    considering the question of a breach of Article 8,

    (1)  Is there an interference with the right  to  respect  for  private
    life (which includes the  right  to  respect  for  physical  and  moral
    integrity) and family life?

    (2)  If so, will such interference have consequences of such gravity as
         potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?

    (3)  Is that interference in accordance with the law?

    (4)  Does that interference have a legitimate aim?

    (5)  Is the interference proportionate in a democratic society  to  the
         legitimate aim to be achieved.

       I also take account of  s.  117B of the Nationality  Immigration and
 Asylum Act 2002  which sets out public interest considerations  that
should be taken into account when considering Article 8 ECHR i.e

         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in  the
public interest.
         (2) It is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-
             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
             (b) are better able to integrate into society.
         (3) It is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
         financially independent, because such persons-
             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
             (b) are better able to integrate into society.
         (4) Little weight should be given to-
             (a) a private life, or
             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that is
             established by a person at a time when the person is in the
             United Kingdom unlawfully.
         (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by
         a person at a time when the person's immigration status is
         precarious.
         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-
             (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and
             (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave
         the United Kingdom.

27.  I accept that the Appellant has a family life  with  his  partner.   I
    accept that he has developed a private life in the years  he  has  been
    here.  He has friends.  He has no job and he and his partner appear  to
    be virtually totally financially reliant on her children.  I  am  aware
    from the previous hearing that the Sponsor has worked in the  past  but
    frankly her evidence about their current financial situation was  vague
    and unimpressive. Certainly I cannot be  satisfied  that  there  is  no
    reliance on public funds.  I have considered the appeal in the light of
    s. 117B especially ss. 4 bearing in mind that the Appellant has been in
    the UK unlawfully. Even if I were to take into account his unsuccessful
    asylum application and the  various  other  applications  he  has  made
    including that under the legacy scheme the fact is that  he  has  never
    had leave to remain.

28. The question is whether in all  the  circumstances,  taking  particular
    account of his life with his partner and her children in  the  UK,  the
    Appellant's removal and the resultant interference with his family life
    would be proportionate to the need for immigration control.  I have had
    some difficulty with this case mainly because of the length of time the
    Appellant has been in the UK but the fact is that he does not meet  the
    requirements of para. 276ADE of the Immigration Rules in relation to  a
    long period of residence and cannot simply  allow  the  appeal  on  the
    basis that he very nearly meets those requirements. The length of  time
    is of course a factor and I do place a lot of weight on the  length  of
    time he has been here but that has to be considered in the  round  with
    the rest of  the  evidence  and  bearing  in  mind  the  public  policy
    considerations of s.117B. I  have  already  found  that  there  are  no
    insurmountable obstacles to his partner returning to India with him.

29.  The Appellant could of course return to India  voluntarily  and  apply
    for entry clearance as a partner which would mean that he would have to
    meet the financial requirements of Appendix FM.  I  take  into  account
    too that it seems to me that both the Appellant and  his  partner  were
    less than candid in their evidence.  I  do  think  that  the  Appellant
    exaggerated the health difficulties his partner has and the  amount  of
    assistance he has to give her and I have already expressed doubt  about
    their  evidence  about  family  in  India  and  about  their  financial
    circumstances in the UK.

30. I conclude that the removal of the Appellant from the UK would  in  all
    the  circumstances  be  proportionate  to  the   need   for   effective
    immigration control.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration  Rules  and  on  human  rights
grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
