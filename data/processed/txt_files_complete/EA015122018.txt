Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms F Allen, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Poland born in 1982.  A decision was made
    on 19 January 2018 to refuse  him  admission  to  the  UK  pursuant  to
    regulation 11 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2016 ("the EEA Regulations"). The EEA Regulations were amended in  July
    2018,  but  not  materially  for  the  purposes  of  this  appeal,  the
    amendments in any event post-dating the decision in this case.

 2. He appealed and his appeal came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Meah
    ("the FtJ") on 7 August 2018 resulting in the appeal  being  dismissed.
    The FtJ considered the appeal 'on  the  papers'  as  requested  by  the
    appellant.

 3. The grounds of appeal in relation to the  FtJ's  decision  contend,  in
    summary, that the FtJ failed to have  regard  to  documents  that  were
    before him which were relevant to issues such as whether the  appellant
    represented  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently   serious   threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interests of society (reg 27(5)(c)  of
    the EEA Regulations).

 4. The further background  to  the  appeal  is  that  in  March  2015  the
    appellant was extradited from the UK to Poland to  serve  a  four  year
    sentence relating to three counts of supplying drugs, for which he  was
    convicted on 28 May 2008.  The offences appear to have  been  committed
    between 2003 and 2006.  The appellant is on probation in Poland until 8
    December 2019.

    The FtJ's Decision

 5. The FtJ  quoted  the  respondent's  decision  verbatim  and  identified
    relevant aspects of the EEA Regulations that applied to the appeal.  In
    his 'findings' section he referred at [11] to the appellant's case that
    he wished to come to the UK to have contact with his son who  was  born
    on 17 February 2012.  However, the FtJ  concluded  that  there  was  no
    evidence to show that the appellant was genuinely seeing his  child  in
    the UK and that even if he was the appellant's criminal background  was
    sufficiently serious to outweigh any claim the appellant  may  have  in
    relation to wanting to see and maintain contact with the child.

 6. At [12] in relation to the appellant having a fianc�e  in  the  UK,  he
    referred to the appellant's grounds of appeal in terms of  his  fianc�e
    working in the UK but also being a single mother of two  children,  and
    his stating in the grounds that it would be very difficult to  maintain
    their relationship  because  of  financial  constraints.   However,  he
    concluded that  there  was  no  evidence  before  him  of  any  ongoing
    relationship with anyone in the UK.  He said that even if  he  were  to
    accept the appellant's assertions at face value,  such  a  relationship
    was not sufficient to outweigh the public policy grounds relied  on  by
    the respondent justifying refusal of admission.

 7. He concluded that on the evidence before him that the appellant had not
    acquired a permanent right of residence and therefore was not  entitled
    to the enhanced protection under reg 27(3).

 8. In [16] he said as follows:

         "In all, I have duly noted that which is stated in the  appellant's
         grounds of appeal and considered that which he  has  attached  with
         these, however, there  is  nothing  before  me  to  show  that  the
         respondent's decision is not justified and proportionate in all the
         circumstances."

 9. I should also mention that  at  [4]  he  referred  to  the  appellant's
    grounds of appeal having "some attachments" and referred to them  being
    listed at Section B of the appeal form.

    The Grounds of Appeal and Submissions

10. In the grounds of appeal it is argued  that  the  FtJ  failed  to  have
    regard to material evidence.  In particular, relevant documents were an
    Application for  Release  on  Licence  with  a  translation,  dated  21
    November 2017, a Release on Licence Decision, dated 8 December 2017 and
    a Certificate of Release and Translation.  The  grounds  refer  to  the
    application for release document being one prepared and approved by the
    Deputy Director of the Correctional Institute where the  appellant  was
    then imprisoned.  Amongst other things, the Deputy Director states that
    the  appellant's  behaviour  whilst  serving  his  sentence  should  be
    assessed positively,  and  that  he  had  no  problems  with  observing
    internal Rules and regulations.  That document goes on to state that he
    caused no behavioural problems and is polite to his  superiors  and  is
    agreeable and peaceful towards his inmates.  Since his Application  for
    Release on Licence was last rejected he had been granted privileges six
    times, including the fourth highest types  of  privileges,  mostly  for
    performing  his  duties  at  work  conscientiously.   No   disciplinary
    penalties had been imposed.  The document also refers to work that  the
    appellant had been doing and courses he had  been  attending.   He  had
    participated in "The Alternative"  addiction  prevention  programme  in
    relation to risks of alcohol abuse, drug  abuse  and  psychoactive  and
    psychiatric  substance  abuse.   He  is  said  not  to  belong  to  any
    delinquent subculture.

11. The report goes on to state that the social and criminal prognosis  for
    the  appellant  was  positive  given  his  exemplary   and   consistent
    behaviour, precise future  plans  after  being  released,  an  expected
    change of attitude and a highly critical attitude to the offences  that
    he had committed.  That, it is said, meant a deep  involvement  in  his
    own "re-socialisation process".

12. The Release on Licence Decision refers to his behaviour as having  been
    exemplary and that the social and criminal prognosis was positive.  The
    prosecutor did not object to his release on licence.

13. The grounds contend that the contents of those  documents  should  have
    been fundamental to the determination of the appellant's appeal.  It is
    argued in the grounds that  the  FtJ  seemed  only  to  rely  upon  the
    appellant's previous convictions.  It was also pointed out that he  was
    convicted for crimes which occurred at least 12 years ago and there was
    no evidence before the FtJ which established that the appellant posed a
    genuine, present or serious threat.

14. Further, the FtJ had failed to acknowledge the period  of  time  during
    which the appellant had been 'crime free', between 2006 and the present
    date.  This was relevant to the issue of rehabilitation it is argued.

15. Lastly, it is argued that the FtJ's decision applied the  wrong  burden
    of proof, whereas the burden of proof for expulsion or  removal  of  an
    EEA national lies with the Secretary of State.

16. In her submissions Ms  Allen  relied  on  those  grounds  and  referred
    specifically to the documents identified in  them.   It  was  submitted
    that the respondent's 'rule 24' response about the appellant having  to
    inform the Probation Service (in Poland) of a change of residence, does
    not alter the fact that the FtJ erred in law by failing  to  take  into
    account material evidence.   In  addition,  the  appellant's  statement
    referred to his wanting to seek employment  in  Poland  which  suggests
    that he was not looking to change  his  permanent  residence  and  thus
    would not be in breach of any probation conditions.

17. Mr Melvin,  for  his  part,  relied  on  the  rule  24  response.   The
    respondent's decision clearly explained why the appellant  was  refused
    entry.  Effectively, he was still  in  prison  under  licence  and  the
    Polish authorities therefore plainly still considered him to be a risk.
     Mr Melvin said that his understanding was  that  licence  requirements
    are such that a person needed to remain in the country of origin.

18. It was submitted that the FfJ set out the respondent's reasons for  the
    decision and adopted them in his own  decision.   Since  the  appellant
    would not be admitted to the UK given the requirements of his  licence,
    there was no need for the FtJ to make an assessment of the  appellant's
    character.  Therefore, any error of law on the part of the FtJ was  not
    material.  There was nothing before the FtJ to suggest that he had  the
    right to leave Poland whilst under licence.

    Assessment and Conclusions

19. Reg 11 of the EEA Regulations provides that an  EEA  national  must  be
    admitted to the United Kingdom  on  arrival  if  he  produces  a  valid
    national identity card or passport issued by an  EEA  State.   However,
    that regulation is subject to regs 23(1), (2), (3) and (4) and 31.

20. Reg 23(1), dealing with exclusion and removal from the UK, states  that
    a person is not entitled to be admitted the UK by virtue of reg 11 if a
    refusal to admit that person is justified on grounds of public  policy,
    public security or public health in accordance with reg 27.

21. Reg 27 (as it was at the date of the  decision  under  appeal,  and  as
    material to the appeal) provides as follows:

         27.-   Decisions taken on grounds of public policy, public security
         and public health

         (1)  In  this  regulation,  a  "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
         decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public security  or
         public health.

         (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.

         (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
         with a right of permanent residence under regulation 15  except  on
         serious grounds of public policy and public security.

         (4)  A relevant decision may not  be  taken  except  on  imperative
         grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

             (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period
             of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or

             (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision  is
             in the best interests of the person concerned, as provided for
             in the Convention on the Rights of the Child  adopted  by  the
             General Assembly of the United Nations on 20th November 1989.

         (5)  The public policy and  public  security  requirements  of  the
         United Kingdom include restricting rights  otherwise  conferred  by
         these Regulations in order to protect the fundamental interests  of
         society, and where a relevant  decision  is  taken  on  grounds  of
         public  policy  or  public  security  it  must  also  be  taken  in
         accordance with the following principles-

             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
             proportionality;

             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
             conduct of the person concerned;

             (c)  the personal conduct  of  the  person  must  represent  a
             genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one
             of the fundamental interests of society, taking  into  account
             past conduct of the person and that the threat does  not  need
             to be imminent;

             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
             which relate to considerations of general  prevention  do  not
             justify the decision;

             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
             themselves justify the decision;

             (f)  the decision may be taken on preventative  grounds,  even
             in the absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided the
             grounds are specific to the person.

         (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy and public security in relation to a  person  ("P")  who  is
         resident in the  United  Kingdom,  the  decision  maker  must  take
         account of considerations such as the age, state of health,  family
         and economic situation of P, P's length of residence in the  United
         Kingdom, P's  social  and  cultural  integration  into  the  United
         Kingdom and the extent of P's links with P's country of origin.

         (7)  ...

         (8)  A court or tribunal considering whether  the  requirements  of
         this regulation are met must (in particular)  have  regard  to  the
         considerations contained in Schedule 1  (considerations  of  public
         policy, public security and the fundamental  interests  of  society
         etc.)

22. It is evident therefore, that one of  the  matters  that  needs  to  be
    considered is whether the personal conduct of the person  represents  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society.   Therefore,  amongst  other  things,
    there must be an assessment of the risk of reoffending.  It is also the
    case that a person's previous criminal convictions do not in themselves
    justify the decision.

23. Although the FtJ referred in indirect terms to having documents  before
    him, he did not identify those documents, i.e. those identified in  the
    grounds of appeal.  They were plainly  germane  to  the  issues  to  be
    resolved under reg 27.

24. In advance of the hearing a  witness  statement  from  the  Immigration
    Officer who made the decision in this appeal was provided.  It was  not
    a document that Mr Melvin was aware of and nor had it been provided  to
    the appellant's representatives.  It justifies the appealed decision in
    various  different  respects,  for  example  referring   to   the   EEA
    Regulations, the appellant's  background  and  circumstances,  and  the
    Council Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA (on the mutual  recognition  of
    judgments and probation decisions).

25. However, nothing of the Council Framework Decision is  evident  in  the
    FtJ's decision and the decision suffers from the  defects  to  which  I
    have referred  in  terms  of  the  proportionality  assessment  and  in
    relation to the issue of the risk of reoffending.

26. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that  the  FtJ  erred  in  law  in
    failing  to  take  into  account  material  documentary  evidence   (as
    summarised at [10]-[12] above) which was relevant to the outcome of the
    proceedings.  I do not accept that any error of law in this respect was
    immaterial. In so far as the Council Framework Decision is relied on by
    the respondent, I am not persuaded that it unequivocally points to  the
    conclusion that the appellant would in  any  event  be  prevented  from
    entering the UK or that it could have that effect, at least not on  the
    basis of the limited argument put before me.

27.  Accordingly, I set aside the decision of the  FtJ.  Given  that  there
    needs to be a full appraisal of the appellant's appeal in the light  of
    all the evidence, which so far has not been undertaken, the appropriate
    course is for the appeal to be remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  to
    be heard by a judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Meah, with  no
    findings of fact preserved.  In deciding to remit  the  appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal I have had regard to paragraph 7.2 of the  Practice
    Statement of the Senior President of Tribunals and taken  into  account
    the extent of  the  fact-finding  required  in  the  re-making  of  the
    decision

    Decision

28. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law.  Its  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  appeal  is
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a  hearing  de  novo  before  a
    judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Meah, with  no  findings  of
    fact preserved.
