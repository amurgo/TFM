For the Appellant:     Mr Bramble, a Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Trussler of Counsel


                            Notice of abandonment

Background

      1. The Secretary of State refused Miss Dhindaw's application for leave
         to remain on 1 April 2014. Her appeal  against  that  decision  was
         allowed by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Osborne  ("the  Judge")  on
         article 8 grounds only following a hearing  that  concluded  on  28
         January 2015. Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Blum  granted  permission  to
         appeal on 5 June 2015.

The hearing before me

      2. Mr Bramble produced evidence that on 1 June 2015 Miss  Dhindaw  was
         granted leave to remain  outside  the  Immigration  Rules  until  1
         December 2017. Mr Trussler told me that she was in  India.  I  note
         that an application for an adjournment made on her  behalf  due  to
         her mother's ill health in India was refused on  29  October  2015.
         That application did not say that Miss Dhindaw was in India.

Discussion

      3. I am satisfied that, pursuant to rule 17A (1) (a) and  (b)  of  the
         Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  the  appeal  is
         deemed to have been abandoned as Miss Dhindaw has left  the  United
         Kingdom and been granted leave to remain here.

Notice:

    The appeal made by Miss Dhindaw for  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom is abandoned.


Signed:

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Saffer
4 November 2015
