                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a Kurdish citizen of Iran,  born  on  [  ]  1995.   He
    sought asylum, based on his support for the KDPI, and on a  friend  who
    had been arrested having given his name to the authorities.

 2. The respondent refused the appellant's claim for reasons  explained  in
    her letter dated 28 January 2016.  It was not accepted that the Iranian
    government knew or suspected him to be a member  or  supporter  of  the
    KDPI.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Sweeney dismissed the appellant's appeal  for
    reasons explained in his decision promulgated on 16 November 2016.

 4. The appellant's grounds of appeal are stated  in  his  application  for
    permission to appeal dated 11 November 2016 (which in terms of  the  TP
    (UT) Rules 2008, rule 23 (1A), now stands as the notice  of  appeal  to
    the UT).

 5. Ground (1) is that the judge placed "too much weight on  one  perceived
    inconsistency in  the  appellant's  account,  rather  than  taking  the
    evidence as a whole".  [The inconsistency is not specified.]

 6. Ground (2) is that the judge "placed too much weight  on  plausibility"
    in relation to the appellant finding out from someone who works for the
    Ettela'at that his friend had been detained.

 7.  Ground  (3)  challenges  the  finding  at  �62  that  the  appellant's
    participation in a single demonstration [in the  UK]  was  unlikely  to
    attract attention or prompt enquiries from the  authorities.   This  is
    said to be contrary to BA Iran  CG  UKUT  36,  which  lists  sur  place
    activities among the criteria to be  assessed,  and  to  constitute  an
    error of failing to engage with country guidance.

 8. FtT Judge Keane granted permission to appeal on 10  January  2017.   He
    thought it "Robinson  obvious"  that  the  judge  failed  to  refer  to
    background evidence which might have supported the appellant's  account
    of events.

 9. Deputy UT Judge Murray dismissed the appeal by decision promulgated  on
    27 February 2017.  UT Judge Pitt refused permission to  appeal  to  the
    Court of Session by decision dated 29 March 2017.  The appellant sought
    and was granted permission to appeal to the Court.

10. Parties then entered into a joint minute:

        "WINTER for the appellant and MACIVER for the respondent  concur  in
        stating to the court  that  this  appeal  has  been  settled  extra-
        judicially, it being accepted  by  the  respondent  that  the  Upper
        Tribunal erred in law in taking the decision under  appeal  for  the
        following reason:

        In concluding that the appellant would not face risk of  persecution
        or ill-treatment upon his return to Iran, the UT  founded  upon  its
        assessment that his activity during his time in Iran was  not  of  a
        nature to "attract the attention" of the Iranian authorities "or  to
        prompt enquiries" from  them  upon  his  return  ...  and  upon  its
        assessment that the authorities would not  have  identified  him  as
        having taken part in political activity during his time  in  the  UK
        ... Although the UT did found upon the case of SSH and  HR  Iran  CG
        [2016] as part of its assessment of risk, it failed to take  account
        of the finding at paragraph 23 of that case the returnees would face
        questioning at the airport upon return ... It thereby failed to take
        account of the possibility that the appellant's  political  activity
        during his time in the UK would by that route become  known  to  the
        authorities, and consequently failed  to  assess  the  risk  to  him
        should that occur.

        They therefore crave the court:

        to allow the appeal;

        to set aside the decision of the UT ...;

        to  remit  the  case  to  a  differently  constituted  UT  ...   for
        reconsideration, on all grounds which are before it ... "

11. The Court pronounced an interlocutor accordingly on 13 September 2017.

12. Mr Winter submitted thus:

      i) The grant of permission was on the "Robinson obvious" point  rather
         than anything in the grounds.

     ii) The appellant's focus in course of his onward  appeals  shifted  to
         �15(j) and 60 of the FtT decision: the finding that he took part in
         a demonstration organised by the KDPI in London on 12 July 2016.

    iii) Nevertheless, and, notwithstanding the focus in the  joint  minute,
         all grounds were open in terms of the interlocutor,  not  only  the
         issue of risk arising from questioning at the airport.

     iv) The appellant's FtT bundle 2,  item  1,  the  respondent's  country
         information and guidance, 2.3.3,  was  evidence  of  a  distinction
         drawn by the Iranian authorities between ordinary Kurds  and  those
         involved  or  perceived  to  be  involved  in   Kurdish   political
         activities.

      v) Although the judge found at �61 no  risk  of  the  appellant  being
         identified as a participant in the demonstration,  that  overlooked
         his liability to questioning.

     vi) The respondent's guidance also acknowledged zero tolerance and risk
         of persecution for perceived activism at any level.

    vii) These points had been made to the FtT: written submissions, �38.

   viii) On this issue, the outcome should be reversed.

     ix) Alternatively, the case should be remitted  to  the  Ft  for  fresh
         decision, setting aside the  credibility  findings,  on  the  issue
         identified in the grant, or on grounds (1) and (2).

13. I observed that there was no explicit finding on whether the  appellant
    took part in the demonstration in bad faith or in good faith, and while
    that usually made no difference to a sur place  claim,  it  might  have
    some bearing on risk on return, and the account the appellant might  be
    expected to give of himself to the authorities.

14. Mr Winter submitted it should be taken that he  acted  in  good  faith,
    there being no finding to the  contrary,  and  that  he  would  respond
    accordingly to  questioning,  which  led  to  a  risk  of  a  stage  of
    interrogation and ill-treatment entitling him to protection.

15. Mr Matthews accepted that all grounds were open, and  that  ground  (3)
    was wide enough  to  cover  the  appellant's  principal  argument.   He
    submitted further thus:

      i) There was no merit  in  the  grounds  challenging  the  credibility
         findings.  The judge referred  to  and  said  he  took  account  of
         background materials and local circumstances  (e.g.  �22-23),  this
         was a specialist tribunal, and it had not been shown that he failed
         to do as he said.

     ii) In any event, the crucial reasons for discounting credibility  were
         to do with internal inconsistencies and implausibilities, unrelated
         to background materials.

    iii) The only possible lacuna in the decision  was  the  absence  of  an
         explicit  finding  on  whether  the  appellant   engaged   in   the
         demonstration in good or in bad faith.

     iv) The absence was unsurprising, as the  demonstration  was  6  months
         after the respondent's  decision;  it  was  first  mentioned  in  a
         witness statement dated shortly  before  and  effectively  produced
         only at the hearing; the respondent  was  not  represented  at  the
         hearing;  the  matter  had  not  been  the  subject   of   specific
         submission; and the issue had been formulated only since.

      v) The judge decided that the appellant  was  not  credible,  and  not
         politically active.

     vi) The judge's general finding of  bad  faith  extended  also  to  the
         attendance at the demonstration.

    vii) It was accepted that some questioning was routine  on  return,  and
         that the appellant was not to be expected  to  lie;  but  once  the
         finding was read across, there was no reason to  conclude  that  he
         might place himself at risk.  There was no more to  come  to  light
         than a failed asylum claim.  It has been decided that such does not
         amount to a protection need.

   viii) If there was a need for any further finding, that should be reached
         by way of a further hearing in the UT.

16. Mr Winter in reply said that if the decision were to be set aside  only
    on the specific point turning on attendance at the  demonstration,  the
    appellant was likely to seek to give further evidence.

17. I reserved my decision.

18. Grounds (1) and (2), the general attack on credibility, lack meaningful
    content, and have not been shown to be any more  than  disagreement  on
    the facts. The terms of the grant of permission  were  not  adopted  or
    developed in submissions,  and  that  matter  takes  the  appellant  no
    further.

19. While the possibility of a further hearing was tentatively discussed, I
    have decided that on any view of  legal  error,  that  would  serve  no
    practical purpose.  The appellant has said all he wishes to say, to the
    effect that he engaged in activities both in Iran and in the UK in good
    faith.  He has not made any application to give further  evidence,  and
    is hardly likely to shift his ground.

20. As to good or bad faith in attending the demonstration, the reason  the
    judge recorded no separate finding is that one was not asked  for.   It
    was a possible fine distinction which had not occurred to parties as of
    any possible relevance.

21. No reason has been shown for the generally adverse credibility  finding
    not to apply to attendance at the demonstration.  A distinction on this
    point would be exceedingly improbable.

22. The appellant therefore has no more to say to the  Iranian  authorities
    than that he is a failed asylum seeker, with  a  history  no  different
    from many others.

23. SSH and HR (illegal exit: failed asylum seeker)  Iran  CG  [2016]  UKUT
    00308 (IAC), is headnoted  thus.  The  paragraph  relied  upon  by  the
    appellant is also set out:

        "(a)      An Iranian male whom it is sought to return to  Iran,  who
        does not possess a passport, will be returnable on a laissez passer,
        which he can obtain from the Iranian Embassy on  proof  of  identity
        and nationality.

        (b) An Iranian male in respect  of  whom  no  adverse  interest  has
        previously been manifested by the Iranian State does not face a real
        risk of persecution/breach of his Article 3 rights on return to Iran
        on account of having left  Iran  illegally  and/or  being  a  failed
        asylum seeker.  No such risk exists at the time  of  questioning  on
        return to Iran nor after the facts (i.e. of illegal exit and being a
        failed asylum seeker) have been established.  In  particular,  there
        is not a real risk of prosecution leading to imprisonment.

        ...

        23. This has to be seen, as with all these pieces  of  evidence,  in
        the context of the evidence overall.  In our view the evidence  does
        not establish  that  a  failed  asylum  seeker  who  had  left  Iran
        illegally would be subjected on return to a period of  detention  or
        questioning such that there  is  a  real  risk  of  Article  3  ill-
        treatment.  The evidence in our view shows no more  than  that  they
        will be questioned, and that if there are  any  particular  concerns
        arising from their previous activities either  in  Iran  or  in  the
        United Kingdom or whichever country they  are  returned  from,  then
        there  would  be  a  risk  of  further  questioning,  detention  and
        potential ill-treatment.  In this regard it is relevant to return to
        Dr Kakhki's evidence  in  re-examination  where  he  said  that  the
        treatment they would receive would depend on their individual  case.
        If they co-operated  and  accepted  that  they  left  illegally  and
        claimed asylum abroad  then  there  would  be  no  reason  for  ill-
        treatment, and questioning would be for a fairly brief period.  That
        seems to us to sum up the position well, and  as  a  consequence  we
        conclude that a person with no history other than that  of  being  a
        failed asylum seeker who had  exited  illegally  and  who  could  be
        expected to tell the truth when questioned would  not  face  a  real
        risk of ill-treatment  during  the  period  of  questioning  at  the
        airport.  We should add that we see no reason to doubt  Dr  Kakhki's
        evidence that there is a special court at or near the airport  which
        considers the cases of returnees but the evidence does  not  show  a
        real risk of ill-treatment in  breach  of  Article  3  amounting  to
        persecution as a consequence of attending at the court."

24. Paragraph 34, which appears immediately after the passage which  became
    the headnote, makes it clear that it extends to Kurds:

        "It was however agreed that being Kurdish  was  relevant  to  how  a
        returnee would be treated by  the  authorities.   For  example,  the
        Operational Guidance  Note  refers  at  3.12.14  to  the  government
        disproportionally targeting minority groups,  including  Kurds,  for
        arbitrary  arrest,  prolonged  detention  and  physical  abuse.   No
        examples however have been provided of  ill-treatment  of  returnees
        with no relevant adverse interest factors other than  their  Kurdish
        ethnicity, and we conclude that the evidence does not show  risk  of
        ill-treatment to such returnees, though we accept that it  might  be
        an exacerbating factor for a returnee otherwise of interest."

25. Similar issues arose in AS (Iran) [2017] EWCA Civ 1539:

    "30.   I turn next to Ground 3. Under  this  Ground  Ms  Farbey  argues
        there were three flaws in the decision. First, while it was  correct
        to conclude, with SB (Iran) CG [2009] UKAIT 00053 in  mind,  that
        earlier illegal exit was insufficient to give  rise  to  a  risk  on
        return, Judge Beg failed to consider the risk that  the  Appellant's
        UK-based political activities in Britain might become  known,  as  a
        result of form-filling  or  questioning  on  her  arrival  in  Iran.
        Second, when placing reliance "on the lack of evidence  as  to  what
        [she] would be questioned about on return" [paragraph 55], Judge Beg
        failed to have regard to the Country Information Guidance as to  the
        treatment of failed asylum seekers.  In  particular,  the  Appellant
        makes reference to a report from Amnesty International  of  February
        2012, indicating that returning asylum seekers are  interrogated  as
        to their political activities abroad, and "will be held  for  a  few
        days until it is clear to police that they have not been involved in
        political  activity".  This  guidance  was  referred   to   in   the
        Respondent's Country Information, and should have been considered by
        the First-tier Tribunal.

     1. Thirdly, if and to the extent that the  First-tier  Tribunal  placed
        reliance  on  the  Appellant's  ability  to  conceal  her  political
        activities  by  omitting  any  mention  of  them   when   completing
        questionnaires or in interview, such an approach would conflict with
        the dicta of the Supreme Court in RT (Zimbabwe) v The Secretary  of
        State for the Home Department [2013] 1 AC 152, see the judgment  of
        Lord Dyson at paragraphs 26/27.

     1. The Secretary of State suggests that the First-tier  Tribunal  dealt
        properly with this aspect of the claim, in paragraphs 45  to  55  of
        the determination. Starting from the findings that the Appellant had
        exaggerated the interest in her during her previous  stay  in  Iran,
        and sought to boost her case by her sur place activities, and then
        having  regard  to  the  general  and  low-level  nature  of   those
        activities, the Tribunal was  justified  in  concluding  that  those
        activities had not been sufficient to bring her to the attention  of
        the Iranian regime, despite the degree of monitoring  of  activities
        within and outside Iran. She has  "no  real  political  profile"  in
        Iran, and there was no convincing evidence that she was identifiable
        or identified by the Iranian regime. Mr Hickman submits  that  Judge
        Beg dealt with this issue  directly  and  sufficiently.  He  further
        argues that the fact the  judge  did  not  mention  "every  item  of
        evidence" falls far short of an error of law.

     1. Here too I would accept the  submissions  of  the  Respondent.  This
        Ground in large part represents a challenge to the factual  findings
        in the First-tier Tribunal. In essence, Judge Beg concluded that the
        Appellant's political activity was at a low level, so low  that  she
        has fallen under the radar of the Iranian government. There  was  no
        evidence to suggest the Appellant would  be  a  suspected  political
        activist or that she would be questioned  directly  about  political
        activity. Mr Hickman is correct that the Tribunal did  not  conclude
        that the Appellant would be required  to  lie  about  her  political
        engagement in Britain. As the Appellant's  expert  Dr  Fatah  stated
        (paragraph 55), it is "not always clear why people  are  questioned"
        on entry and "there is no way of knowing what  they  are  questioned
        about".

     1. It appears to me that the Tribunal's reasoning is sufficiently clear
        in relation to this  Ground,  and  here  too  I  would  dismiss  the
        appeal."

26. The paragraph of the country guidance on  which  the  appellant  relies
    does support the possibility of questioning at  the  airport,  but  the
    argument that this creates a risk in a case  such  as  the  present  is
    rejected.  The same line failed in the Court of Appeal in AS.

27. The appellant might be questioned,  but  the  findings  and  background
    evidence do not show that in order to avoid persecution he  would  have
    to tell any lies.

28. The grounds and submissions do not show that the making of the decision
    of the FtT involved the making of any error on a point of law, so  that
    decision shall stand.

29. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.

            Upper Tribunal Judge Macleman
