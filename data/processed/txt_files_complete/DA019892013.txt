For the Appellant:     Mr Walsh, Counsel instructed by Bindmans LLP
For the Respondent:          Mr Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of Azerbaijan whose identity  is  protected
    for the purpose of these proceedings by an order for anonymity.


 2. On the 24th September 2013 the Respondent made a decision to deport the
    Appellant pursuant to s3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 (as amended)
    on the grounds that his deportation would be conducive  to  the  public
    good. The event which had led to  this  decision  was  the  Appellant's
    conviction, on the 20th December 2012,  of three counts  of  possessing
    "control identity documents with intent" for which he  had  received  a
    concurrent sentence of 12 months in prison[1].

 3. The Appellant appealed against that decision  and  in  a  determination
    promulgated on the 4th February 2015 the First-tier Tribunal  dismissed
    his appeal on all grounds. The Appellant appealed that decision to  the
    Upper Tribunal and in a written decision dated the 2nd February 2016  I
    found the determination of the First-tier Tribunal to contain errors of
    law such that it must be set aside. My written reasons are attached  to
    this determination at 'Appendix A'. In summary it was accepted  by  the
    Secretary of State  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  misunderstood
    certain aspects of the evidence so that the decision was in part  based
    on errors of fact. The errors were such that the reasoning as  a  whole
    could not be upheld.  Having set the decision  aside  I  directed  that
    that it be re-made in the Upper Tribunal.

 4. When the matter came back before me on the 15th March  2016  Mr  Tarlow
    had not had sufficient time to prepare for the  hearing.  He  requested
    some additional time, which I granted.  When the hearing began at 11.30
    I heard evidence from the Appellant and three additional witnesses, and
    submissions on behalf of both parties.  I reserved my decision, which I
    now give.





    Legal Framework and Matters in Issue

 5. The legal framework was agreed between the parties to  be  as  follows.
    The decision to deport is  made  with  reference  to  s3(5)(a)  of  the
    Immigration Act 1971 (as  amended).  Because  the  Appellant  has  been
    convicted of an offence leading to a sentence of 12  months  in  prison
    his deportation is deemed to be  in  the  public  interest.    In  this
    appeal the burden lies on the Appellant to show that  he  falls  within
    one of the 'exceptions' set out in the Immigration Rules. The Appellant
    relies on the exceptions contained at paragraph 397:


           1.         397. A deportation order will  not  be  made  if  the
              person's removal pursuant to the order would be  contrary  to
              the UK's obligations under  the  Refugee  Convention  or  the
              Human Rights  Convention.  Where  deportation  would  not  be
              contrary to these obligations, it will only be in exceptional
              circumstances that the  public  interest  in  deportation  is
              outweighed.


    In respect of the Refugee Convention it is for the  Appellant  to  show
    that he has a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution  in  Azerbaijan  for
    reasons of his imputed political opinion.  The  standard  of  proof  is
    lower than that  normally  applicable  in  civil  matters  and  can  be
    expressed as a 'reasonable likelihood' or a 'real risk' that  he  would
    face such harm. In respect of the Human Rights Convention the Appellant
    relies on Article 3 ECHR. He contends that if  returned  to  Azerbaijan
    there is a real  risk  that  he  would  face  torture  or  inhuman  and
    degrading treatment.   If the Appellant succeeds in showing that he  is
    a refugee, or that his  removal  would  violate  the  United  Kingdom's
    obligations under Article 3, his appeal must be allowed.

 6. If the Appellant fails to demonstrate that he will come to serious harm
    if returned  to  Azerbaijan,  he  relies  in  the  alternative  on  his
    relationship  in  the  United  Kingdom  with  his  wife,  a  Lithuanian
    national.   The Appellant contends that his wife is  exercising  treaty
    rights and that he is therefore the family member of  an  EEA  national
    "qualified person". If that is so the question of his deportation falls
    to be assessed with reference to  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006 ('the Regs'):

         Exclusion and removal from the United Kingdom


         19.
           ...
          (3) Subject to paragraphs (4) and (5), a person who has been
         admitted to, or acquired a right to reside in, the United Kingdom
         under these Regulations may be removed from the United Kingdom if-
         ...
          (b) he would otherwise be entitled to reside in the United Kingdom
         under these Regulations but the Secretary of State has decided that
         his removal is justified on the grounds of public policy, public
         security or public health in accordance with regulation 21.






         Decisions taken on public policy, public security and public health
         grounds


         21.-(1) In this regulation a  "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
         decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public security  or
         public health.


           (2) A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.


           (3) A relevant decision may not be taken in respect of a  person
         with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15  except  on
         serious grounds of public policy or public security.


           (4) A relevant decision may not be taken  except  on  imperative
         grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-


           (a) has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period  of
           at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or


           (b) is under the age of 18, unless the relevant decision is
           necessary in his best interests, as provided for in the
           Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted by the General
           Assembly of the United Nations on 20th November 1989(1).


         (5) Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public policy
         or public security it shall, in addition to complying with the
         preceding paragraphs of this regulation, be taken in accordance
         with the following principles-


         (a) the decision must comply with the principle of proportionality;
         (b) the decision must be based exclusively on the personal conduct
         of the person concerned;
         (c) the personal conduct of the person concerned must represent a
         genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of
         the fundamental interests of society;
         (d) matters isolated from the particulars of the case or which
         relate to considerations of general prevention do not justify the
         decision;
         (e) a person's previous criminal convictions do not in themselves
         justify the decision.


         (6) Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of public
         policy or public security in relation to a person who is resident
         in the United Kingdom the decision maker must take account of
         considerations such as the age, state of health, family and
         economic situation of the person, the person's length of residence
         in the United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural integration
         into the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's links with
         his country of origin.
         ...


 7. Because the evidence before me falls to be divided  thematically,  that
    is the way I have structured my determination.  I  first  consider  the
    evidence and submissions on asylum/Article 3 ("the protection  issues")
    and make my findings.  I then address the question of deportation under
    the Regs.





    The Protection Issues

 8. The Appellant claimed asylum on the 29th January 2013.   The  basis  of
    his claim was,  in  brief  summary,  that  he  had  been  a  successful
    businessman with links to  the  ruling  elite  in  Azerbaijan.  He  had
    started his career under the patronage of the Abdullayev  brothers  and
    persons associated with them. Those relationships had soured  when  the
    Appellant  broke  away  and  formed  his  own  company.  The  Appellant
    describes the people he had been associating with as  "like  a  Mafia".
    When he tried to distance  himself  from  them  they  tried  to  regain
    control by claiming his assets, threatening him  and  pressurizing  him
    with false criminal accusations. In early 2007 the  Appellant  enlisted
    the help of a man ('I') who acted as an intermediary  between  him  and
    his enemies.  He  thought  that  the  conflict  was  on  the  verge  of
    resolution when 'I' was arrested. The Appellant fled  from  Azerbaijan,
    entering the United Kingdom with a visit visa.  He  has  remained  here
    ever since.     He believes himself to be at risk of  serious  harm  in
    Azerbaijan because  he  has  intimate  knowledge  of  the  corrupt  and
    criminal activities carried on by members of the ruling  Aliyev  family
    and their cronies. After he arrived in the UK he learned that the Azeri
    authorities were pursuing false allegations against  him.  In  fear  of
    these proceedings he executed a  statutory  instrument  to  change  his
    name. His subsequent conviction related  to  his  possession  of  false
    documents created in this new identity.  The Appellant submits that the
    situation in Azerbaijan has worsened since he left.  The  fall  in  the
    price of oil has placed the government under  huge  financial  pressure
    and the impetus to "go after" Azeris with money  has  increased.    The
    government believes the Appellant to be an  individual  of  substantial
    net worth and as such it would be in their interests to pursue him with
    false criminal charges so that they could seize control of his assets.


 9. This account requires the Appellant to demonstrate a) that he is indeed
    the successful businessman that he claims b) that his account of  being
    harassed and threatened is true and c) that he is currently at risk  on
    return in Azerbaijan today.  The Appellant relied on three  very  large
    bundles of evidence and a number of supporting witnesses  in  order  to
    discharge the burden of proof in respect of these three matters. I have
    looked with care at all of the documents that the parties  referred  me
    to. In his submissions Mr Walsh asked me to give  particular  attention
    to the evidence from the following sources:

        a) The Appellant's own testimony  (giving  detail  to  the  account
           summarised above), supported by documentary evidence
        b) Murad Gassanli
        c) Mike Cunningham
        d) Robert Chenciner
        e) Professor Bill Bowring



    The Appellant's Evidence


10. The Appellant adopted his witness statements dated 13th March 2013  and
    14th April 2014 and gave live evidence.


11. The Appellant was brought up by his mother who was a single parent.  He
    obtained good qualifications at school and in 1995 was enrolled in  the
    National Academy of Aviation. After graduation  in  1999  he  became  a
    lieutenant in the Azeri Air Force, flying the L39 and Mig  25.  Between
    2000 and 2004 he worked part time for  the  national  airline  and  the
    Flight  and  Civil  Aviation  Authority[2].    During  this  time   the
    Appellant's real interest was in business: as he puts it, he "wanted to
    make something of myself". He had a friend at school  who  was  wealthy
    and well-connected. The Appellant and  another  friend  had  started  a
    company producing CDs and this rich school-friend persuaded  them  that
    what they needed to make their business grow was powerful backers.   To
    this end he introduced them to the Abdullayev family.  The  Abdullayevs
    were three brothers who ran a huge company called AMAY.  The  Appellant
    describes AMAY as being comparable to the Virgin group in the  UK.  For
    instance it owns  shopping  malls,  hotels,  restaurants,  construction
    companies, banks and factories.  The Abdullayev brothers  were  closely
    connected to the ruling Aliyev family, in particular Jalal, the brother
    of the former President Heyder Aliyev.   The  Abdullayevs  declined  to
    invest in the Appellant's business but were impressed by  him.  One  of
    the brothers, Yulat, offered the Appellant a job as his  assistant  and
    as  a  manager  in  one  of  the  AMAY  group  companies,  called   AYF
    International. The Appellant worked there between 1998 and 2000.


12. The Appellant describes the  system  in  Azerbaijan  as  being  like  a
    pyramid of patronage, centred around powerful clans.    He  worked  for
    Yulat; Yulat and his brothers were sponsored by Jalal  Aliyev,  who  in
    turn was backed by the  President.   Jalal's  brother  Heydar  was  the
    leader of Azerbaijan from Soviet times and when he stood down  in  2003
    his nephew,  Heydar's  son  Ilham,  took  over  as  president.    These
    relationships worked both ways. The  more  powerful  individuals  would
    offer protection to those below them, whilst  those  below  would  'pay
    tribute' up the chain.   It operated like a mafia, with  the  President
    acting as 'Godfather'.   The system was propped  up  by  a  network  of
    spies and the President would use the police and security  services  to
    suppress any dissent or commercial interests that posed a threat to the
    monopoly enjoyed by his family, and their friends like the Abdullayevs.
     A key feature of this system of patronage is the krysha - your  krysha
    can be thought of as your patron, or protector. In mafia terms it would
    be your 'captain'.

13. In 2000 the Appellant was promoted and was given a  job  as  a  General
    Manager in AMAY  and  as  an  assistant  to  Abdulla  Abdullayev.   The
    Appellant was given this role because he had proved that  he  could  be
    trusted, and because of his  skills  with  IT  and  computers.  Abdulla
    became the Appellant's krysha.  One of the  things  the  Appellant  did
    when working for Abdulla was to  create  fake  documents  for  planning
    permission which enabled  Abdulla  to  take  over  buildings  and  land
    without difficulty. Not all of these  deals  were  conducted  with  the
    knowledge or approval of Abdulla's krysha  Jalal  Aliyev:  "there  were
    certain business ventures that he did not want  Jalal  to  know  about.
    Having someone like me on board made this easier given my skills"[3].

14. In 2001 AMAY bought Birlik Bank and an insurance company called  Nishan
    Insurance.   The Appellant was the Head of IT by this time and  he  was
    given a "small" share of between 1-2% in each[4]. He was  appointed  to
    the Board of Directors  of  Birlik  Bank  where  he  observed  what  he
    believed to be corrupt and illegal practices.   His  primary  role  was
    however to continue his work as assistant to Abdulla:

         "He controlled all aspects of my life, dictating what I  could  and
         could not do. I would receive calls from his secretary  telling  me
         that Abdulla wanted to see me straight away. I was on call 24 hours
         a day and I had to drop everything for him. He dictated my life, my
         jobs, where I lived and my relationships"[5].

    Abdulla addressed the Appellant has "brother" and they had a very close
    working relationship. In 2002 Abdulla had a cash  flow  difficulty  and
    the Appellant sold his house to help him out. Abdulla held this  up  to
    other Birlik Board members as an example of how they should behave.

15. It was whilst he was associated with Birlik Bank that he met his  first
    wife, K. She was employed in the Human Resources  Department.  In  2002
    they decided to get  married.  This  caused  some  difficulty  for  the
    Appellant. Abdulla  was  not  particularly  happy  about  the  proposed
    marriage. Looking back on it the Appellant thinks that perhaps  Abdulla
    was concerned that he would lose some  control  over  him  if  he  were
    married. Also her father was a member of the opposition party.  Abdulla
    came to their engagement party but only briefly, to 'show his face'[6].
    He did not attend the wedding.  Although they had  previously  been  so
    close, after the wedding  Abdulla  started  to  become  "cold"  to  the
    Appellant.  Although they still enjoyed a cordial business relationship
    the Appellant understood that something had changed, and  that  he  may
    not now make the hoped for progress under his patronage.  Although  the
    Appellant continued his work in Abdulla's businesses he also decided to
    set out on his own. In 2004 he therefore started his own business.   He
    sold a flat that Abdulla had given him (as compensation for having sold
    his home to help him) and invested it in establishing  a  new  software
    company called Aliksoft[7].


16. The business did well and quickly expanded. Through his connections the
    Appellant was able to get the relevant licences and found "open doors".
    He continued to sit on the Board of  Birlik.  The  Deputy  Director  of
    Birlik Bank was a man named Fakhredin Efendiyev. He and  the  Appellant
    got on well and decided to set up another business  together.  In  2005
    they established FZ Credit  Union[8].   They  also  both  continued  to
    pursue other projects.  Fakhredin Efendiyev was subsequently  appointed
    to be the Director of Birlik Bank, having  proved  himself  willing  to
    turn a blind eye  to  certain  corrupt  practices.  The  Appellant  won
    contracts for Aliksoft and established other smaller companies[9].   In
    early 2006 he was considering establishing his own cable TV company. In
    April of that year he  attended  a  party  in  a  restaurant  in  Baku.
    Whilst there he had a brief meeting with a journalist with  a  view  to
    discussing the news channel. It was over in about 15  minutes  and  the
    Appellant returned to the party.

17. Some days later the Appellant received a call from Fakhredin Efendiyev.
    He told the Appellant that they needed to speak straight away.  He  was
    busy but agreed to meet. He went to the bank  to  see  him.  The  first
    thing that Fakhredin Efendiyev did was to take the  Appellant's  mobile
    telephone from him, and  remove  the  SIM  and  battery.  He  told  the
    Appellant that the MTN had been to seen him. This is the name for  what
    used to be the KGB. They had brought with them a  statement  about  the
    Appellant and his activities and that they knew that  he  had  branched
    out on his own with "no backing".   Fakhredin told the MTN officer that
    he backed the Appellant and that  he  supported  him.  He  advised  the
    Appellant to slow down and that he was "attracting the  wrong  kind  of
    attention". He said  that  the  Appellant  should  stop  expanding  his
    businesses. The MTN had told him that  they  had  the  Appellant  under
    surveillance and that they had seen him in the restaurant in Baku.  The
    Appellant was very frightened and shaken by  what  Fakhredin  Efendiyev
    told him. He trusted him however and believed what he said.

18. At that point the Appellant's combined  businesses  were  turning  over
    $100 million per annum.  Fakhredin Efendiyev advised the Appellant that
    in order to lower his profile he should transfer all of his  shares  in
    six of his businesses to him. He would  hold  them  on  trust  for  the
    Appellant.   When  Fakhredin  suggested  this  solution  the  Appellant
    understood that he was trying to get control of all of his  assets.  He
    refused to accept the offer. Fakhredin Efendiyev informed him  that  he
    would make his life very difficult. True to  his  word,  the  Appellant
    started having problems with government at all  levels,  and  was  even
    threatened by local gangs.

19. By May 2006 the Appellant was very  worried.  He  decided  to  approach
    Abdulla Abdullayev directly.  He was forced to wait for an appointment.
    Once the day arrived the Appellant was subject to  further  humiliation
    by being made to wait 3-4  hours  before  being  called  in.  Once  the
    meeting started the Appellant apologised to Abdulla for trying to  make
    it on his own. He explained the nature of his businesses and offered to
    make Abdulla a partner  in  all  of  them.  Abdulla  did  not  let  the
    Appellant finish talking. He interrupted him asking whether the thought
    that he was stupid. He told the Appellant to "get to fuck and to find a
    good lawyer". It was at that point that the Appellant  understood  that
    his life was in danger and there was nothing he could do about it.

20. In the weeks which followed all of the Appellant's  businesses  started
    failing. Fakhredin Efendiyev was a partner in  most  of  them  and  the
    Appellant knew that it was his doing. Employees  left  in  droves.  The
    Appellant's calls and movements were being tracked and he was left with
    only 2-3 close friends who stood by him.  In  October  he  was  in  his
    office with his father-in-law when two plain clothed policemen entered.
      They arrested the Appellant and took him to the  police  station.  He
    was in the waiting room when a random woman he had never met came up to
    him and started insulting him in extreme language.  The  Appellant  was
    very confused. He now realises that this had been an attempt to provoke
    him - he was supposed to have assaulted the woman and this  would  have
    given them a pretext to imprison him.  The officers came and  took  him
    to an interrogation room. One of them punched him and took his ID card.
     He looked at the card and told the Appellant that he was going to  get
    a new one saying that he was a criminal.   The Appellant was trying  to
    explain that all of this was a misunderstanding when the  door  to  the
    interview room opened and a Sergeant came in. He said that the Chief of
    Police had ordered his release.  When he got out he saw his  father-in-
    law and the local Councillor. They drove him away.   His  father-in-law
    explained that his old friend  the  Councillor  had  made  a  call  and
    authorised his release.


21. The Appellant was panicking and terrified about what might happen next.
     He went into hiding in the private house of a friend. He was trying to
    sell his assets so that he could prepare to leave Azerbaijan. He wanted
    to kill himself because he could not see a way out.  He  thought  about
    slashing his wrists and even wrote  a  letter  saying  goodbye  to  his
    sister.  The police started to look for him. They contacted his  former
    driver and asked him to inform on where the Appellant  was  hiding.  He
    genuinely did not know where the Appellant was and so could  tell  them
    nothing. He subsequently passed on a message to the  Appellant  through
    the Appellant's friend that the  police  wanted  him  to  come  in  for
    questioning.  In December 2006 the public  prosecutor  started  putting
    pressure on his father-in-law. The Appellant's wife  became  frightened
    and divorced him. She did this in order to protect  herself  and  their
    son.

22. Someone advised the Appellant that he needed to  get  some  protection.
    A friend introduced him to 'I', a gang member in Baku. This man offered
    to mediate on the Appellant's behalf in return for 50% of  his  assets.
    By January 2007 'I' had managed to secure agreement from the police  in
    Baku that they would not try and arrest the  Appellant.  The  Appellant
    became hopeful that perhaps his problems could be resolved. However  in
    February 2007 'I' was arrested at his offices by a Colonel Usubov,  the
    son of the Minister of Police.

23.  The  Appellant  left  Azerbaijan  in  February  2007  using  his   own
    passport[10] and a valid UK visit visa. He was very frightened boarding
    the plane but did not experience any problems.

24. In July 2007 the Azeri authorities issued a warrant for the Appellant's
    extradition[11]. The charges related to allegations that the  Appellant
    swindled two investors of $32,000 when he was working at  Birlik  Bank.
    The Appellant states that the allegations were a complete  fabrication.
    He was a Director with a role in IT and had no contact  with  the  bank
    floor or lending decisions. He had no means  or  motive  to  steal  any
    money. These allegations have now been dropped but  they  serve  as  an
    illustration of how determined the authorities are to go after him.

25. The Appellant believes that he remains at risk. He remains at  risk  in
    part because they know that he hid a lot of money and they want it[12],
    but also because he knows a lot of their secrets, ie  the  corrupt  and
    illegal mechanisms the elite used to make money.  These  activities  go
    to the "heart of government".




    Murad Gassanli


26. Mr Gassanli adopted his witness statement dated  14th  April  2014  and
    gave oral evidence.  He is a British citizen of Azeri origin and has  a
    long history of involvement in  politics  in  Azerbaijan.  In  1999  he
    established an organisation called the Vatan Society for Azeri students
    in the UK. During this period he had close links with the Azeri embassy
    in London and the  regime  in  Baku.  He  was  friends  with  President
    Aliyev's granddaughters who were also studying in London. However these
    relationships became strained after the Vatan Society tried to  promote
    democratic debate during the 2003 elections.  The embassy  accused  him
    of disloyalty because he had organised a meeting and invited opposition
    candidates to speak. This changed his view of politics  in  Azerbaijan.
    He was  subsequently  appointed  as  the  Director  of  the  Azerbaijan
    Democratic Association - UK, a pro-democracy group.  He has served as a
    senior advisor to the  Azerbaijani  opposition  presidential  candidate
    Jamil Hasanli. He is a graduate of LSE and is currently working on  his
    PhD at Cardiff  University.  He  is  a  regular  commentator  on  Azeri
    politics for instance speaking at events at Chatham House  and  on  the
    BBC. In 2013 he was elected as a Labour Party Councillor in Westminster
    and since then has ceased his direct  involvement  in  Azeri  politics.
    In response to Mr Tarlow's questions Mr Gassanli confirmed that  he  is
    not giving evidence as an entirely impartial 'expert' witness.  He  has
    been deported from Azerbaijan and in 2005 was badly beaten by the Azeri
    police whilst attending  a  rally  in  Baku.  He  cannot  therefore  be
    described as a "friend" to the regime, however his views simply reflect
    the standpoint taken by human rights organisations, the  UK  government
    and members of the United States' Congress.


27. Mr Gassanli has known  of  the  Appellant  since  2005.  He  wanted  to
    establish a  website  called  www.times.az  to  promote  education  and
    political debate in Azerbaijan and was looking for a way to  build  and
    promote it. He was told  by  people  in  Baku  that  a  company  called
    Aliksoft would be able to help. It was the first company in  Azerbaijan
    to provide a complete package of solutions including  IT  software  and
    security. Mr Gassanli recalls one of his colleagues coming back from  a
    meeting with Aliksoft and being very impressed. They produced a "really
    slick  design"  for  the  website  and   provided   very   professional
    international  standard  brochures.  However,  the  connection  between
    Aliksoft and AMAY was brought to Mr Gassanli's attention.  He  and  his
    colleagues were vey concerned about this. Since they were an opposition
    group they could not be seen to be using the services of  a  pro-regime
    company. They could  not  trust  Aliksoft.    Also,  they  feared  that
    Aliksoft would pull the plug once they understood  the  nature  of  the
    website; once they realised that this was not just another "media start-
    up".  Mr Gassanli explains:


         "It made sense knowing that Aliksoft was part of  Jalal  [Aliyev]'s
         fiefdom. There is no way it could have developed  at  the  rate  it
         did, coming out  of  nowhere  to  being  a  market  leader  without
         government backing.  You  need  a  government  licence  to  provide
         internet services in Azerbaijan. [The Appellant] has recently  told
         me that he got all his licences from the Ministry of Communication,
         confirming  what  we  thought  at  the  time.  This  is   virtually
         impossible unless you are highly connected and yet [the  Appellant]
         managed to organise  these  within  a  month.  The  only  way  [the
         Appellant] would have  got  these  licences  was  because  everyone
         thought he had the protection of Jalal Aliyev. If  people  knew  he
         had gone rogue, there is no way he would have been able to make the
         success of his business that he did...


         At the same time I also heard some disparaging remarks  about  [the
         Appellant]. People talked about him and  said  that  he  was  Jalal
         Aliyev's man, that he was a bit of a lothario and  was  spending  a
         lot of money. There was a rumour going round Baku at the time  that
         he had bought  12  BMWs  for  his  friends  and  just  handed  them
         out...[13]"

28. In his statement  Mr  Gassanli  sets  his  personal  knowledge  of  the
    Appellant in the context of his understanding of  Azeri  society  as  a
    whole. He states that the former President Heydar Aliyev was  from  the
    Nakchivan enclave and that when he came to power he installed into  all
    the relevant positions of power people from his own clan. All  the  key
    positions in the country are all held by  people  from  that  clan.  He
    states:


         "Before that, these people were farmers, Soviet-era  administrators
         and old nomenclature staff, with  little  understanding  of  modern
         realities and technologies, and would have needed people like  [the
         Appellant] to show them how to switch on a  computer  and  send  an
         email...[14]"


    Mr Gassanli gives Abdulla Abdullayev  as  an  example  of  a  Nakchivan
    "nobody" who became powerful under Aliyev patronage. He has watched the
    video of the Appellant's engagement party and can confirm that  Abdulla
    is in it and made a speech.


29. Mr Gassanli did not meet the Appellant in person until 2009  when  they
    met in London. He was introduced to the Appellant by  his  father.   Mr
    Gassanli had just returned from a lobbying  trip  to  America  and  was
    looking for investment to establish a satellite TV channel. He made  it
    clear to the Appellant that he was an opposition activist and this  was
    the purpose  of  the  new  station.   The  Appellant  declined  to  get
    involved. He wasn't interested in politics and in Mr Gassanli's opinion
    was just interested in making money. Mr Gassanli found him  to  have  a
    "sense of entitlement". He gave the impression that he believed that in
    the UK, as in Azerbaijan, anything could be bought. Mr Gassanli was not
    impressed.


30. They did not meet again until in November 2013 the Appellant  contacted
    Mr Gassanli through Facebook using his assumed identity. When they  met
    again Mr Gassanli described the Appellant as being  "like  a  different
    person". He was no longer the rich kid  who  could  buy  anything,  but
    appeared to be humble, depressed and fearful.   The Appellant  told  Mr
    Gassanli what  had  happened  with  the  changed  identity,  the  false
    documents and the conviction. He seemed "rattled". He told Mr  Gassanli
    that when he had first come to  the  United  Kingdom  his  friends  had
    advised him not to claim asylum but he now realised that he should  not
    have listened to them.   Following this meeting Mr  Gassanli  contacted
    friends in Baku to ask about the Appellant. A friend at a  news  agency
    confirmed the Appellant's involvement with Aliksoft and  said  that  he
    had "got done" by Jalal, meaning that his business had been taken over.
    Mr Gassanli concludes:


         "[The Appellant] is in this  position  because  he  was  na�ve.  He
         didn't think it was suicide to go out on his own.  [The  Appellant]
         thought that as he wasn't  competing  with  anyone  and  he  wasn't
         taking any business away from Jalal Aliyev then he didn't  have  to
         give them a cut. If he gave them a cut he would have had a few more
         years before his businesses were taken over. For them it was a case
         of ensuring a precedent wasn't set. They couldn't allow a kid  that
         they took out of university when he was nobody and who used to make
         their tea to be seen as someone who was now  handing  out  BMWs  to
         their friends.[15]"

31. In closing his oral evidence Mr Gassanli underlined  that  he  was  not
    giving evidence because he a friend to the Appellant. As far as he  was
    concerned the Appellant and his like were all  part  the  problem.  The
    business  class,  and  their  culture  of  nepotism,   repression   and
    corruption have left most of the Azeri population in poverty, suffering
    terrible human rights abuses.  He has chosen to give  evidence  because
    he firmly believes the Appellant to be at risk should  he  be  returned
    home. It is systematic: once you fall out of favour,  they  come  after
    you.  If you leave the country, they will come  after  you  until  they
    have all your money. In his statement  he  gives  several  examples  of
    individuals  who  have  hitherto  had  close  relationships  with   the
    Nakchivani clan, only to end up in jail.   Once they have you, there is
    a "100% risk of torture". Ironically, as a political prisoner you would
    have some  level  of  protection  because  of  international  pressure.
    'Economic cases' enjoy far less scrutiny and accordingly the chance  of
    physical harm is far higher.    Because of  the  collapse  in  the  oil
    price the situation for the Appellant and people like  him  has  become
    far worse, as the Aliyevs scrabble around for money to fill  the  black
    hole in the country's budget. Their solution appears to be to "go after
    the next tier down" and recoup money that this group has made over  the
    years:


         "There has been massive devaluation of the currency and an economic
         collapse because of the drop in oil  price.  The  whole  fa�ade  is
         falling apart. The clique at the top who were siphoning off the oil
         money - when  that  collapsed  the  whole  thing  fell  apart.  The
         Minister for National Security  is  currently  under  house  arrest
         being investigated for fraud. The head of  the  International  Bank
         has been arrested - he was a close friend of the President and  now
         he is being shaken down. Its like the final  scene  in  a  gangster
         movie where they all turn on each other.   The  relevance  to  [the
         Appellant] is that they will want to get his assets in the UK. I am
         giving statements in two other extradition  matters  that  are  the
         same - the state coming after rich Azeris who are living abroad  to
         try and get their assets"[16].

32. Mr Gassanli stated  that  as  far  as  he  is  aware,  the  extradition
    proceedings  were  dropped  against  the  Appellant  but  that  another
    investigation has started. There is been a policy decision to go  after
    anyone with assets of more  than  a  million  dollars.  After  spending
    millions on events like the Eurovision Song  Contest  there  is  now  a
    budget hole of $10 billion and they need to go after any penny they can
    get.  If they pursued another criminal case against the Appellant - the
    most likely scenario - he would be very  unlikely  to  receive  a  fair
    trial. The judiciary are not independent and human  rights  abuses  are
    endemic.


    Michael Cunningham


33. Mr Cunningham adopted his witness statement dated 14th April  2014  and
    gave oral evidence. Mr Cunningham  is  a  former  Director  of  British
    Aerospace who has worked as a consultant for the British government and
    the private sector for over three decades. He worked  in  Saudi  Arabia
    for many years and after the collapse of the Soviet Union he  was  sent
    by the British  government  to  "get  a  feel"  for  potential  defence
    contracts  in  the  new  post-Soviet  states  and  to  advise  on   the
    privatisation of their space industry.  In this role he spent a lot  of
    time in Azerbaijan. He  now  acts  as  a  private  consultant  for  the
    business community and it was in this context that he was introduced to
    the Appellant in a London law office in 2007.


34. Mr Cunningham described the Appellant as being "impulsive" and "out  of
    his depth" in the UK. He failed to understand that  in  London,  things
    were not as they are in Baku. He thought that any problems one had, for
    instance with the authorities, could be solved by money. Mr  Cunningham
    tried to advise him and stop him being taken advantage  of.   After  he
    had known the Appellant for about a year  the  Appellant  informed  him
    that he had been forced to flee Azerbaijan and that he was  in  trouble
    for having defied the ruling  family.  At  the  Appellant's  behest  Mr
    Cunningham travelled to Baku in August 2008 in order to try and  secure
    the release of  some  of  the  Appellant's  funds.  These  assets  were
    invested in an Azeri bank called Eurobank and it  was  the  Appellant's
    intention to acquire a controlling interest in  the  bank  so  that  he
    could then liquidise his funds.

35. Mr Cunningham arranged a meeting with the Director of Eurobank. He  was
    advancing the case for the acquisition of shares by the Appellant,  but
    using the Appellant's pseudonym.  At some point during the  meeting  Mr
    Cunningham's interpreter used the Appellant's real name.  In  his  live
    evidence Mr Cunningham described how, upon hearing it,   the  faces  of
    those present immediately dropped. One of  those  present  became  very
    aggressive. He said that the Appellant was  "finished".  Mr  Cunningham
    understood this to mean "finished"  in  more  than  just  the  business
    sense. He was told that the Appellant had crossed the ruling family and
    that he was a "very foolish boy" who had been arrogant and had tried to
    operate independently of the Aliyevs. For this he  would  be  punished.
    The bank officials present at the meeting explained  to  Mr  Cunningham
    that the Appellant had been forced out of  Azerbaijan  because  he  had
    shown a "lack of respect" for the  Aliyevs.  His  life  had  been  made
    impossible there by a constant stream of  visits  by  the  police,  tax
    officials and 'mafia' like groups.   He was described as a "young Turk"
    who was being held up as an example to others of what  happens  if  you
    step out of line.  In subsequent meetings  with  officials  from  other
    banks Mr  Cunningham  heard  similar  assessments  of  the  Appellant's
    position: he had been stupid enough to take  on  "the  family"  and  he
    could "expect severe punishment".


36. Mr Cunningham has made 6 visits to Baku since that trip  in  2008,  the
    most recent of which was in 2014.  At a dinner on that occasion someone
    else  mentioned  the  Appellant's  name  and  it  provoked  a  "furious
    response" from those  present.  Mr  Cunningham  was  assured  by  those
    present that the Appellant was being  sought  and  that  "he  would  be
    taught the meaning of respect".   Mr  Cunningham  states  that  in  his
    opinion, based on his understanding  of  Azerbaijan  and  what  he  has
    witnessed, that if the Appellant were to be returned to  Azerbaijan  he
    would likely face torture, extreme humiliation and probably execution.



    Mr Robert Chenciner

37. Mr Chenciner is an academic with substantial experience in  the  former
    Soviet Union. He is a a Senior Associate Member of St Antony's  College
    Oxford and an Honorary Member  of  the  Russian  Academy  of  Sciences,
    Daghestan Filial. His report has been prepared specifically to  address
    two questions raised by the evidence: was the Appellant  a  businessman
    as claimed, and  to  describe  the  nature  of  the  krysha  system  of
    protection.


38. In respect of the latter Mr Chenciner gives a detailed history  of  how
    the system of patronage in  modern  day  Azerbaijan  evolved  from  the
    Soviet blat system and how  the  'Nakchivan  mafia'  made  particularly
    effective use of it.  In essence the underlying principle is  that  you
    cannot derive a benefit without also incurring a debt. The term  krysha
    translates as 'roof', ie overhead protection.  He  explains  how  there
    has developed a rivalry between different factions of the Aliyev family
    and that this has affected the fortunes of those  below  them.  Abdulla
    Abdullayev was himself a victim of this when he was  recently  arrested
    after Jalal Aliyev lost faith in him.  These complex relationships  are
    interwoven with cultural expectations and mores though  which  a  clear
    understanding of what is happening is concealed, or sometimes revealed.
    For example Abdulla's decision not to attend  the  Appellant's  wedding
    would have been widely perceived as an insult and a signal that he  was
    withdrawing patronage.  Marriage in Azerbaijan  continues  to  be  very
    often arranged, if not by natal families, by patrons. Abdulla is likely
    to have taken the Appellant's decision to marry against his wishes as a
    "deep family insult".


39. In respect of the Appellant himself Mr  Chenciner  has  considered  his
    account in the context of his personal knowledge of Azeri  society.  He
    considers it to be plausible at every stage.   In  respect  of  current
    risk the report  highlights  the  arrest  and  prosecution  of  Abdalla
    Abdullayev who in April  2014  was  refused  bail,  facing  charges  of
    embezzling funds from AMAY.   The breakdown of  Abdulla's  relationship
    with his kryshas in the Aliyev family illustrates  how  vulnerable  the
    Appellant would be, particularly if Abdulla  begins  to  give  evidence
    against former colleagues.



    Professor William Bowring

40. Bill Bowring is a recognised expert on  the  countries  of  the  former
    Soviet Union. He is fluent in Russian and has published widely  on  the
    Russian language, history, culture, law and practice. He was called  to
    the Bar in 1974 and continues to practice  at  the  European  Court  of
    Human Rights. He is a Professor of Law at Birkbeck College,  University
    of London. He has for a number of years  been  an  advisor  to  the  UK
    government on human rights issues in the former Soviet Union.   I  have
    been provided with a copy of a report that Professor  Bowring  prepared
    for the benefit of  the  Magistrates  in  the  Appellant's  extradition
    proceedings.   Since it was directed at those proceedings, which are no
    longer live, the report is of limited relevance to this  appeal.    The
    conclusions  that  are  pertinent,  drawn  inter  alia  from  Professor
    Bowring's  analysis  of  information  found  on  the  Russian  language
    internet, are:


        o  That  Azerbaijan  is  one  of  the  most  corrupt  and  brutally
          repressive countries of the former Soviet  Union,  which  despite
          having the constitutional form of a republic, is in fact akin  to
          a monarchy, in which the son of the first President has succeeded
          to his father


        o Today's Azerbaijan is run in  a  manner  similar  to  the  feudal
          system found in Europe in the Middle Ages

        o Azerbaijan ratified the Statute  of  the  Council  of  Europe  in
          January 2001 and has since ratified an impressive list of Council
          of Europe  treaties,  including  ECHR,  but  there  are  "serious
          doubts" about its compliance with  regular  credible  reports  of
          gross and systematic human rights violations

        o Jalal Aliyev has  used  the  courts  in  order  to  seize  assets
          belonging to his erstwhile partners

        o Birlik Bank was one of four  Azeri  banks  which  were  found  in
          January 2010 to be uninsured. By September 2010 it was subject to
          a thorough investigation and in  January  2011  its  licence  was
          revoked.  Its share-holders were listed at being 20  people.  The
          Appellant is listed as number 10 and had a "substantial" holding.
          The Bank was declared bankcrupt on the 27th July 2012.

        o In 2006 Aliksoft won "Company of the Year"

        o It is highly unlikely that the Appellant  would  receive  a  fair
          trial in Azerbaijan and all sources (Council of Europe  Committee
          for  the  Prevention  of  Torture,  US  State  Department,  FIDH,
          Azerbaijan Committee Against Torture,  United  Nations  Committee
          Against Torture), note numerous allegations of the use of torture
          and of harsh and inhumane conditions in prison





      Protection Findings

41. The Appellant did not claim asylum  or  human  rights  protection  upon
    arrival in the UK. He instead changed his name and used  illegal  means
    to buy false documents,  an  offence  for  which  he  was  subsequently
    convicted. The failure to make a prompt claim is something that I  must
    weigh against the Appellant in my assessment  of  his  credibility:  s8
    Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Act 2004.


42. When the Respondent assessed the claim, the predominant feature of  his
    case was the fact that the Azeri government had issued  an  extradition
    warrant against the Appellant in connection with the theft  of  $32,000
    from two  customers  of  the  Birlik  Bank.   The  Respondent  -  quite
    understandably in view of the chronology  -  took  the  view  that  the
    asylum claim was an attempt to avoid  criminal  prosecution.   Although
    the warrant has now been cancelled I have kept in mind,  throughout  my
    assessment of the evidence, that it is a possibility  that  the  entire
    account has been fabricated for that reason.

43. The documentary evidence in this case was  substantial.  The  Appellant
    produced  bank  statements,  share  certificates,   company   accounts,
    contracts and the like relating to numerous  companies  with  which  he
    claimed  connection.  Two  experts  have  produced  reports   and   two
    additional witnesses have given their  perspective  on  their  dealings
    with the Appellant and their personal experience in  Azerbaijan.   That
    evidence was not always consistent or easy to understand. For  instance
    the Appellant and Mr Gassanli placed emphasis on Aliksoft as a  company
    of significance whereas it would appear from the  conclusions  of  both
    experts that this was only a small part of  the  Appellant's  holdings.
    The accounts and other documents did not always correspond in format to
    the way in which they would appear in the UK and this made  deciphering
    their  contents  a  challenge.  I  have   taken   into   account   such
    discrepancies that have been brought to my attention.

44. The Appellant was not a witness who impressed the First-tier  Tribunal.
    He was found to be deceitful and evasive. Witnesses who  spoke  in  his
    support before this Tribunal, Mr Cunningham and Mr Gassanli,  described
    him as arrogant, na�ve, out of his depth, and willing to  buy  his  way
    out of any trouble. He  is  characterised,  in  his  own  evidence,  as
    someone who benefitted hugely by the corrupt and criminal practices  of
    the Azeri elite: as Mr Gassanli put it, he was "part of  the  problem".
    Many would argue that the oligarchs of  Eastern  Europe  have  been  no
    friends to democracy, accountability or  human  rights.    My  decision
    cannot however be based on whether the Appellant is a likeable  man  or
    whether his past business practices are to be condoned.   The  decision
    can only be based on the evidence, and having considered it all in  the
    round, I find it to point, in its totality, firmly in one direction.

45. The Appellant is not a refugee. Having heard the persuasive and  cogent
    evidence of Mr Gassanli, Mr Walsh conceded that he could not make out a
    case that any feared harm was for one  of  the  five  reasons  included
    Article 1A of the Refugee Convention. If the Azeri authorities wish  to
    do the Appellant harm, it is not for reasons of his race,  nationality,
    religion, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion
    - imputed or otherwise.

46. I am however entirely satisfied  that  the  Appellant  is  at  risk  of
    serious harm because a) he  is  perceived  to  have  slighted  powerful
    members of the Azeri elite by trying  to  make  it  alone  without  the
    protection of a krysha and b) they now wish to  seize  his  assets  for
    themselves. The Appellant has shown, to the  lower  standard  of  proof
    applicable, that his return to Azerbaijan would be reasonably likely to
    result in a violation of Article 3 ECHR.

47. My reasons are as follows.

48. The Appellant has demonstrated that he was a successful businessman  in
    Azerbaijan. The Appellant's  statements  are  extremely  detailed.  His
    account of progressing, with the  assistance  of  contacts,   from  his
    career in aviation to a managerial role in AMAY, and from there working
    his way up  to  positions  of  increasing  influence  is  one  that  is
    internally consistent and plausible in the context  of  the  background
    material.  Although the Appellant was not  from  one  of  the  powerful
    families who run Azerbaijan he was young, willing and talented.  As  Mr
    Gassanli put it,  the old guard "would have  needed  people  like  [the
    Appellant] to show them how to switch on a computer and send an email".




49. Mr Gassanli was a very  impressive  witness.  He  brought  a  level  of
    understanding of Azeri politics akin to that of an expert but  made  it
    clear that he did not appear on  that  basis.  He  appeared  simply  to
    confirm what he knew about the Appellant personally, and was  blunt  in
    expressing his own opinion that the Appellant and his like  "were  part
    of the problem". I have attached significant  weight  to  his  evidence
    which I found  to  be  clear,  credible,  objective  and  helpful.   Mr
    Gassanli described how, upon a visit to Azerbaijan in 2005 he  came  to
    know about the Appellant, whom people in Baku  spoke  of  as  "Aliyev's
    man".  The  Appellant  had  by  then  gained  some  notoriety  for  his
    ostentation, giving away new BMWs to his friends and  apparently  using
    his influence to full effect,  fast  gaining  a  licence  for  his  new
    business Aliksoft. The  Appellant's  evidence  about  Aliksoft  growing
    quickly to become an influential company is supported  by  Mr  Gassanli
    who was recommended its services during that 2005 trip. He describes it
    as producing impressive and "slick" work which was new for the Azeri IT
    sector. It is further supported by the evidence unearthed by  Professor
    Bowring that in 2006 it was named Azeri "company  of  the  year".   The
    extent of the Appellant's  connections  is  further  confirmed  by  the
    stills from his engagement video in which Abdulla Abdullayev  is  seen,
    standing up and giving a speech[17].

50. The Appellant describes his relationships with the Abdullayev  brothers
    and Jalal Aliyev in the context of the krysha system. There is  nothing
    in  the  evidence  I  have  heard  which  contradicts  that  claim.  Mr
    Chenciner, Professor Bowring and Mr  Gassanli  all  explain  that  this
    convention is the underpinning of the system of patronage in modern day
    Azerbaijan, with  its  roots  in  the  mechanics  of  old-style  Soviet
    government.   It is a form of relationship  based  on  absolute  trust,
    respect and loyalty. The more powerful partner enables  the  lesser  to
    operate with impunity, and in return receives a cut of  any  gain.  The
    analogy with the mafia  is  apposite.   I  am  satisfied  that  Abdulla
    Abdullayev was the Appellant's krshya and that this enabled him to grow
    a significant level of influence and wealth in Azerbaijan between  1998
    and 2006.    I accept that this included a position on the board of the
    Birlik Bank and that the Appellant was  given  a  1-2%  share  in  this
    institution.

51. I am further satisfied, to  the  lower  standard  of  proof,  that  the
    Appellant behaved in such a way that his relationship with Abdulla  and
    his  group  of  influence  was  eventually  severed.    The   Appellant
    identifies his decision to marry K in 2002 as being  the  beginning  of
    his fall from grace. The  reasons  for  Abdulla's  objections  are  not
    entirely clear. It may have been because she was  the  daughter  of  an
    opposition figure, or simply because, as Mr Chenciner suggests, because
    she was not the bride chosen by Abdulla himself. Mr Chenciner  confirms
    that arranged marriages are still the norm in Azerbaijan and that  they
    are an  integral  part  of  maintaining  the  feudal  power  structure.
    Although the marriage did  not  cause  the  breakdown  of  this  krysha
    relationship,  the Appellant's decision to proceed even  after  Abdulla
    had advised against it was perhaps the first indication that he  had  a
    spark of independence in him.

52. That willingness to 'go it alone' was  subsequently  exhibited  in  the
    Appellant's decision to set up his own companies and  to  strike  deals
    without Abdulla's knowledge  or  consent.  Having  had  regard  to  the
    Appellant's own detailed evidence, supported to a significant degree by
    the documentary evidence produced, I find that the Appellant  did  have
    involvement with a number of companies other than Birlik.

53. It was these deals which appear to have led,  in  early  2006,  to  the
    unravelling of the Appellant's life in Baku.   The  Appellant  gives  a
    compelling account of how, over a period of weeks, his world  began  to
    fall apart and it became very apparent that he had lost the support  of
    the Abdullayevs.   By the Appellant's account it began  with  the  call
    from Fakhredin Efendiyev, who recounted the visit from  the  MTN.   The
    Appellant explains with consistency and clarity his subsequent visit to
    Abdulla, how his businesses nosedived and what  happened  when  he  was
    arrested.   Having set his testimony about these matters in the context
    of the evidence overall I am  satisfied  that  these  events  did  take
    place.    What is less clear is how and why overtly criminal  gangs  in
    Baku became involved.  I do not understand, for instance, what possible
    benefit the Appellant believed he could gain from the  intercession  of
    'I'.    I am nevertheless satisfied that the overall account is a  true
    one, and in making that finding I have placed  considerable  weight  on
    the supporting evidence of the two key witnesses, Mr  Gassanli  and  Mr
    Cunningham.


54. I have already expressed my views as to  the  value  of  Mr  Gassanli's
    evidence.  He has nothing to gain in supporting the  Appellant  and  he
    made it abundantly clear that in many ways he did  not.  Three  factors
    have however persuaded Mr Gassanli that the Appellant is  currently  at
    risk in Azerbaijan. First he was alerted to a change in his fortunes by
    the transformation in the Appellant's demeanour when he met  him  again
    in 2013. He was no longer the flashy rich kid, but appeared  frightened
    and "humbled". This led Mr Gassanli to make enquiries with  friends  in
    Baku who told him that the Appellant had  been  "done"  by  his  former
    krysha.  Setting  this  information  in  the   context   of   his   own
    understanding of what is happening in Azerbaijan today, Mr Gassanli has
    concluded that the Appellant is at risk. This is  in  part  because  he
    grew too big for his boots: "they couldn't allow a kid that  they  took
    out of university when he was nobody and who used to make their tea  to
    be seen as someone who was now handing out BMWs to their  friends".  It
    is however primarily because those he has antagonised  now  desperately
    need his money: "Its like the final scene in  a  gangster  movie  where
    they all turn on each  other".   I  am  satisfied  that  Mr  Gassanli's
    evidence provides independent corroboration that the  Appellant  is  at
    risk.


55. Mr Cunningham was also  an  impressive  witness.   The  evidence  which
    supported  his  statement  included  documents  indicating   that   the
    Appellant has made substantial donations to community  institutions  in
    Mr Cunningham's  home  town,  and  he  confirms  this  in  his  written
    evidence. Elsewhere he is described as being the  Appellant's  business
    partner. These facts could possibly give  rise  to  an  inference  that
    notwithstanding his long connection with  the  British  government,  Mr
    Cunningham may not be entirely impartial. I have weighed those  matters
    in the balance and having  done  so  I  am  wholly  satisfied  that  Mr
    Cunningham  is  a  reliable  witness,  who  gave  his  evidence  in   a
    straightforward and detailed manner. What  it  revealed  was  that  the
    Appellant is now regarded as "finished" and that in Baku it  is  widely
    believed that he faces "severe punishment" for taking on "the  family".
      Mr Tarlow suggested that Mr Cunningham may not have the full  picture
    and that he may simply have been talking to the "wrong people"  on  his
    trips to Azerbaijan. It is  of  course  possible  that  other  powerful
    figures in Baku may have a different view about the Appellant,  but  Mr
    Cunningham's evidence did not turn on what he was told at one  meeting.
    He was consistently told at numerous  meetings  and  dinners  that  the
    Appellant was - in effect - at risk.  He relates that most recently the
    mention of the Appellant's name at a dinner in 2014 provoked a "furious
    response" from those present who stated that if the Appellant  returned
    "he would be  taught  the  meaning  of  respect".    This  evidence  is
    entirely consonant with what I have been told about the  krysha  system
    and the prevalence of human rights abuses.   Mr  Cunningham's  evidence
    is of a nature rarely found in protection appeals. He is an independent
    witness who  has  had  direct  contact  with  the  putative  agents  of
    persecution and can confirm first hand their malign intent.


56. I do not need to set out in any detail the country background  material
    on human rights abuses in Azerbaijan since the Respondent  accepts  the
    country's record to be  extremely  poor.  Mr  Chenciner  and  Professor
    Bowring both confirm that in their view the Appellant would  be  likely
    to  to  face  "brutal",  "harsh  and  life-threatening"  conditions  in
    detention in Azerbaijan.  Mr Gassanli pointed out that unlike the  many
    political prisoners in Azeri jails, the Appellant would not be  in  the
    protective  glare  of  the  international  media  spotlight  and  would
    therefore be more likely to suffer severe ill treatment.

57. Having weighed all of the evidence before me I am  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant is at risk of serious harm in Azerbaijan for the reasons that
    he claims. He has therefore  succeeded  in  showing  that  his  removal
    pursuant to a  deportation  order  would  be  contrary  to  the  United
    Kingdom's obligations under Article 3 of the Human Rights Convention.


    The EEA Regulations

58. The appeal has been allowed on protection grounds  but  I  address  the
    question of the EEA Regulations in the alterative.


59. It is not now in dispute that the Appellant is married to a  Ms  Rosita
    Gert, a Lithuanian national.  At  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal there was some doubt about whether she was in fact  exercising
    treaty rights. Her evidence that she was a  self-employed  florist  was
    then challenged by the Respondent. Although Mr Tarlow did not  formally
    concede this matter he did not make any submissions about the  evidence
    that is now produced to establish that she is a qualified  person,  and
    that by extension, so too is the Appellant.  The  Appellant  relies  on
    the following evidence:


        o Accounts and Memorandum of Association for 'Foxy Rose  Ltd'  (the
          florists)
        o Screenshots for the Foxy Rose website, Facebook page  etc  and  a
          letter to Ms Gert from Google advertising regarding Foxy Rose
        o Various invoices and receipts for services issued by Foxy Rose
        o Correspondence between HMRC and Ms Gert relating to Foxy Rose
        o Confirmation from Jamie Aston Flowers that Ms  Gert  undertook  a
          professional floristry course there in September 2013
        o Director's report and accounts for  Monarch  Private  Investments
          Ltd showing that Ms Gert was appointed as a Director in  December
          2015
        o Dividend certificates issued by Monarch Private  Investments  Ltd
          showing Ms Gert to have received a net dividend of �50,000 in the
          year ending 31 March 2016
        o Santander bank statements for  Monarch  Private  Investments  Ltd
          showing payments made to Ms Gert
        o Payslips and a P45 showing Ms Gert to have been employed  between
          May and November 2015 by Sterling Accounts  and  Taxation  Office
          Ltd
        o Copies of Ms Gert's comprehensive private health  care  insurance
          policy

60. Ms Gert adopted her witness statements  and  gave  live  evidence.  She
    explains that she started work when the Appellant was sent  to  prison.
    Her mother had been a florist in Lithuania  and  she  had  always  been
    interested in it. She has identified a niche market in the Russian  and
    Eastern European community in London and caters for events as  well  as
    regular clients. She is for instance  often  asked  to  provide  flower
    displays for the Lithuanian embassy.  She is currently  operating  from
    the garage of her home. Asked about  the  payslips  etc  from  Sterling
    Accountancy Ltd Ms Gert explained that this was an office manager role.
    She had done this in order to gain experience of  running  a  business.
    Because the flower business is only busy when a big order comes  in  Ms
    Gert is also running an investment company. In her  live  evidence  she
    explained that this company specialises in providing  advice  to  "high
    net worth individuals" from the former  Soviet  Union  and  India.  She
    receives a salary of �5000 per month.   Asked why  she  continues  with
    the more modest venture of Foxy Rose if she is earning this salary from
    Monarch Investments Ms Gert says that it is because she  loves  it  and
    she is hoping to expand it in the future.


61. Having taken account of all of the evidence before me I am satisfied on
    the balance of probabilities that Ms Gert is a qualified person. She is
    receiving a regular  income  from  her  role  as  Director  of  Monarch
    Investments and her income is supplemented by occasional contracts  for
    Foxy Rose floristry. I am satisfied that she and the Appellant are in a
    genuine relationship and that he is therefore a  qualified  person.  In
    order to deport him on grounds of public  policy  the  Respondent  must
    show that the decision is in accordance with each of the principles set
    out in Regulation 21 (5): the decision  must  be  proportionate,  based
    exclusively on the conduct  of  the  Appellant,  it  cannot  simply  be
    because of his criminal conviction, and  it  must  be  shown  that  his
    personal conduct represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
    threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.

62. I was given very little evidence about the offence itself.  I  am  told
    that the the Appellant bought the false documents in his new name after
    he had arrived in London.   I have placed no weight on the  Appellant's
    explanation that he did this because he was  fearful  for  his  safety.
    There is a sufficiency of protection in the UK  and  there  can  be  no
    justification for the procurement of false documents,  which  undermine
    immigration control as well as law and order. I am satisfied  that  the
    creation and use of false documents is capable of affecting one of  the
    fundamental interests of society.

63. I am not  satisfied  that  in  all  the  circumstances,  the  Appellant
    presents a  "genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat"  to
    justify his deportation. He has committed a crime but  I  am  satisfied
    that there is a very low risk of any reoffending. As Mr Gassanli and Mr
    Cunningham have both attested, the Appellant  is  a  changed  man:  the
    events of recent years have underlined for him the  difference  between
    London and Baku. I am confident that the Appellant  is  remorseful  and
    that he now understands that he  cannot  simply  buy  his  way  out  of
    problems. I am satisfied that in the circumstances there is a very  low
    risk of reoffending.

64. Accordingly I allow the appeal with reference to Regulation 21 (5).
