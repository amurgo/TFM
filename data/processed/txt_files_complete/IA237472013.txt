Representation:

For the Appellant:     M Bhuigan Solicitor's Clerk from Universal
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Mangion, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant was born on 20th July, 1985, and is a citizen  of  Nepal.
    He entered the United Kingdom  in  2009,  with  entry  clearance  as  a
    student.  His leave as a student was  extended  by  successive  further
    grants and the status was subsequently switched to that  of  a  Tier  1
    (Post-Study Work) Migrant, when he was given leave to remain until 10th
    March, 2013.  He made an application on 1st February, 2013,  to  remain
    as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) team together with Hari  Sankar  Kurimineni,
    an Indian citizen and his application was considered under Part  6A  of
    the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules HC 395 as amended.

2.   On 31st May 2013, the  respondent  refused  his  application.   It  was
    considered that the appellant had not met the requirements of paragraph
    245DD(b) and Appendix A, or those in paragraph 245DD(c) and Appendix B.
     He was notified with the same letter of a decision to remove him  from
    the United Kingdom pursuant to Section 47 of the Asylum and Nationality
    Act 2006.

3.   The reasons given  by  the  respondent  for  refusing  the  appellant's
    application were as follows.

    (1)  In respect of access to funds as required the respondent wrote


             "You have claimed 25 points for having access to �50,000 under
             provision (d) of Table 4 of  Appendix  A  of  the  Immigration
             Rules.  You have provided insufficient evidence to demonstrate
             that you have access to at least �50,000."


         The reasons for this are detailed in the written refusal letter.


    (2)  In respect of funds held in a regulated financial institution  the
         reasons given for refusing the claim of 25 points were that


             "We have established that you have not  demonstrated  you  are
             eligible to be awarded points under provision (d) of  Table  4
             of Appendix A  of  the  Immigration  Rules  having  access  to
             �50,000.  As you are  not  eligible  to  claim  points  for  a
             reduced level of funds under provision (d) you are required to
             demonstrate that you are eligible for points for having access
             to funds in any other provision in Table 4.  As you  have  not
             demonstrated by us we are unable  to  accurately  assess  this
             attribute.  We have therefore been unable to award  points  in
             line with published guidance and Appendix A of the Immigration
             Rules."


         In respect of the funds for disposal in the United Kingdom the same
         reasons were given for refusing the claim for 25 points.


    (3)  In reference to  Appendix  B  (English  language)  the  respondent
         stated


             "You  have  claimed  10  points  for  English  language  under
             Appendix B of the Immigration Rules on the basis that you  are
             holding a degree that was taught in English and is  equivalent
             to a UK bachelor's degree or above.  However in this case  you
             have not  provided  the  specified  evidence  required  to  be
             awarded points for English language therefore you have  failed
             to demonstrate that you meet the requirements to be awarded 10
             points for English language under any of the other  provisions
             of Appendix B of the Immigration Rules that apply  to  Tier  1
             Migrants."


    (4)   Points  were  awarded  as  claimed  in  respect  of  Appendix   C
         maintenance.


4.   The appellant appealed.  His  determination  was  heard  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Holmes without an oral hearing.   In  his  determination
    promulgated on 2nd December, 2013, Judge Holmes refused the appellant's
    application.  He noted that the appellant's witness statement  referred
    to the respondent's evidential flexibility policy and  included  within
    the appellant's bundle was a copy of Rodriguez [2013] UKUT 00042 (IAC).
     The judge said that since the amendment introduced in paragraph  245AA
    of the Immigration Rules were brought into force  without  transitional
    provisions and clearly applies to this case, it was not  necessary  for
    him to consider the question which the Tribunal in Rodriguez  did  have
    to decide namely, whether the policy has  survived.   In  doing  so  he
    noted that the text of paragraph 245AA as  cited  by  the  Tribunal  in
    Rodriguez omits the very important sub-paragraphs of (c) and (d).

5.   He considered the version of paragraph 245AA relevant to  the  date  of
    decision and concluded  that  its  incorporation  into  the  Rules  was
    inconsistent with the survival of the policies.  He concluded that  the
    appellant had not submitted  the  document  that  he  was  required  to
    submit, but instead a wholly different document.  He did not  have  the
    original degree certificate available and submitted a letter  from  the
    University of Northumbria confirming details of his degree in order  to
    satisfy Appendix B Table 1 requiring  that  he  prove  that  he  has  a
    knowledge of English equivalent to level B1 or above of the Council  of
    Europe's Common European Framework for English language learning.   The
    appellant was required to provide mandatory evidence, but failed to  do
    so.  As a result the judge concluded that it was not necessary for  him
    to consider the merits of the appeal with reference to Appendix A.

6.   The appellant challenged the decision in lengthy and rather  repetitive
    grounds of appeal and on 24th December last  Designated  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Lewis believed that the grounds raised  a  possible
    error of law in suggesting that the judge  had  misunderstood  the  law
    concluding at paragraph 16 of his determination that paragraph 245AA of
    the  Immigration  Rules  had  effectively  replaced  the  decision   in
    Rodriguez (flexible policy) [2013] UKUT 42  and  did  not  exercise  on
    appeal the discretion which paragraph 245AA conferred.

7.   At the hearing before me the appellant's representative confirmed  that
    paragraph 245AA was not relevant so far as the letter from  Northumbria
    University was concerned.  He confirmed that there was no error of  law
    in respect of the  letter  from  the  university.   The  appellant  was
    required to supply his evidence and Table 2 provided  that  there  were
    five different grounds on which 10 points could be  awarded,  "national
    of a majority English speaking country", "degree  taught  in  English",
    "passed an English language test", "met the requirements in a  previous
    grant of leave", and "transitional arrangements".

8.   Paragraph 7 of Appendix B provides that 10 points will be  awarded  for
    a degree taught in English if the applicant has the relevant  level  of
    English language shown in Table 1 and


    (i)  has obtained an academic  qualification  (not  a  professional  or
         vocational  qualification)  which   either   (1)   or   (2)   these
         requirements are not an issue in this appeal and


    (ii) provides the following specified documents to show that he has the
         qualification:


         (1)  the original certificate or award, or


         (2)  if the applicant is awaiting  graduation  having  successfully
             completed the qualification or no longer has  the  certificate
             and  the  awarding  institution  is  unable   to   provide   a
             replacement an academic transcript or original letter  in  the
             case of a PhD qualification from the awarding  institution  on
             its official headed paper which clearly shows the  applicant's
             name, the name of  the awarding institution, the title of  the
             award, confirmation that the qualification has been or will be
             awarded and the date the certificate will  be  issued  if  the
             appellant has not  yet  graduated  or  confirmation  that  the
             institution is unable to reissue the original  certificate  or
             award.

9.    The  judge  noted  that  appellant  relied  on  a  degree  awarded  by
    Northumbria University in 2011.  At section S6 of the application form,
    where the printed options indicate that he might  send  either  of  the
    original degree certificate or an original academic transcript, neither
    boxes were checked but the appellant had drawn his own  box  indicating
    the letter from the university.  The  letter  is  dated  14th  January,
    2013, and is not addressed to anybody  in  particular.   It  is  signed
    'Helen G Prime' programme administrator.  It is on  the  stationery  of
    the university and says "I would like to confirm that"  it  then  gives
    the appellant's name, his date of birth, "was studying  full-time  with
    Northumbria University programme  master  of  science  and  engineering
    management, 31st January 2009 to 13th  January  2013  the  student  was
    awarded a master of science in engineering management on  9th  February
    2013".   The judge found that the appellant had  submitted  neither  an
    original degree certificate nor an academic transcript.   He  concluded
    that the appellant had failed to demonstrate he met the requirements of
    the Rules.

10.  At the relevant date paragraph 245AA of the Rules said this:

         "245AA.  Documents not submitted with applications
                  (a)  Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to  in  Part
                      6A state that specified documents must  be  provided,
                      the UK Border Agency  will  only  consider  documents
                      which have been submitted with the  application,  and
                      will only  consider  documents  submitted  after  the
                      application where they are  submitted  in  accordance
                      with sub-paragraph (b).
                  (b)  If the application has submitted:
                      (i)   a  sequence  of  documents  and  some  of   the
                           documents in the sequence have been omitted  (for
                           example, if one bank statement from a  series  is
                           missing);
                      (ii)     a document in the wrong format or
                      (iii)    a  document  that  is  a  copy  and  not  an
                           original  document  the  UK  Border  Agency   may
                           contact the applicant or  his  representative  in
                           writing, and request the correct  documents.  The
                           requested documents must be received  by  the  UK
                           Border Agency at the  address  specified  in  the
                           request within seven working days of the date  of
                           the request.
                  (c)  The UK Border Agency will not request documents where
                      a specified document  has  not  been  submitted  (for
                      example an English language certificate is  missing),
                      or where the UK Border  Agency  does  not  anticipate
                      that addressing the omission or error referred to  in
                      subparagraph (b) will lead to  a  grant  because  the
                      application will be refused for other reasons.
                  (d)  If the applicant has submitted a specific document:
                      (i)  in the wrong format; or
                      (ii)     that is a copy and not an original  document
                           the  application  may  be  granted  exceptionally
                           providing the UK Border Agency is satisfied  that
                           the specified documents are genuine and that  the
                           applicant meets all the other requirements.   The
                           UK Border Agency reserves the  right  to  request
                           the specified original documents in  the  correct
                           format in all cases where  (b)  applies,  and  to
                           refuse applications if these  documents  are  not
                           provided as set out in (b)."
11.  The document set out in order to demonstrate  that  the  appellant  was
    entitled to claim the points under Appendix B was not  a  document  set
    out in Part A.  Table B required  either  the  degree  or  an  academic
    transcript.  The appellant submitted a letter from the university which
    clearly did not meet the requirements of the Rules.
12.  Paragraph 245AA makes it clear that where a document is missing from  a
    sequence of documents or where a document is in  the  wrong  format  or
    where a document is a copy and not the original  then  the  agency  may
    contact the appellant or his representative  and  request  the  correct
    document.  The document submitted by  the  appellant  in  lieu  of  his
    original  degree  certificate  was  not  a  document   that   met   the
    requirements of paragraph 245AA(b).
13.  The appellant's representative confirmed that there  was  no  error  of
    law in respect  of  the  letter  adduced  by  the  appellant  from  his
    university.  It follows therefore that there is no  material  error  of
    law in the determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Holmes  because
    any error that there might be could not possibly  have  the  effect  of
    changing the outcome of the appeal.  The appeal falls to  be  dismissed
    in any event.  I uphold the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge.
    This appeal is dismissed.
