For the Appellants:    Mr Greer, Counsel instructed by All Nations Legal
                       Services (Doncaster)
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are both nationals of Eritrea. The  First  Appellant  Ms
    Beshir was born on the 9th November 1985.  The Second Appellant is  her
    son born on the 18th July 2015.   They  seek  entry  clearance  to  the
    United Kingdom in order to settle here with the Sponsor Mr  Abdu  Salih
    Adem who is respectively their husband/father.


 2. The Appellants made their applications on the 24th January 2019.   They
    were refused on the 16th April 2019.  The Respondent noted that to meet
    the financial eligibility requirements set out in Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules the Appellants would  need  to  demonstrate,  by  the
    production of specified evidence, that the household income had been in
    excess of �22,400 per annum during the relevant  period  (July  2018  -
    January 2019).  The Sponsor submitted evidence  to  show  that  he  was
    employed by Mach Recruitment and that he there earned �18,392.42 in the
    relevant period.   This evidence  was  accepted.  The  Sponsor  further
    stated that he had earned �544.19 per month working part time at  Selam
    Internet Caf�. The Respondent accepted that these  additional  earnings
    would take the Sponsor over the minimum  income  requirement,  but  not
    that the earnings had been properly evidenced. In  particular  the  ECO
    explained that the Sponsor had failed to demonstrate  his  earnings  at
    Selam Internet Caf� by the production of 6 months  of  bank  statements
    showing his wages deposited.   Nor had a complete set of payslips  been
    produced.  All other requirements were met.

 3. The Appellants appealed.  On the 29th October 2019 an  Entry  Clearance
    Manager reviewed the case.  He  found  that  the  payslips  from  Selam
    Internet Caf� had been produced, but  maintained  the  refusal  on  the
    ground that the wages could not be seen to have been deposited  in  the
    Sponsor's bank account (issue i).  In addition the  ECM  could  not  be
    satisfied that the correct tax had been paid on these  earnings  (issue
    ii).   These then were the matters that fell for consideration when the
    appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal in January 2020.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal (Judge Myers) decision was promulgated  on  the
    5th February 2020.

 5. In respect of issue (ii) the simple explanation offered by the  Sponsor
    is that no tax is deducted  week-to-week  from  his  pay  at  the  caf�
    because his earnings there are too low. HMRC is however aware  of  this
    part time work and he pays the correct amount of tax overall.   In  the
    year 2018/19 he did have some additional tax to pay (presumably on  top
    of the PAYE tax deducted from his wages at Mach Recruitment)  but  this
    was resolved by changing his tax code.   The  Tribunal  had  regard  to
    written evidence from HMRC which confirmed this account. Having done so
    it found in the Appellants' favour on issue (ii).

 6. In respect of issue (i) the Tribunal heard evidence from the Sponsor to
    the effect that he is paid in cash for his job at the caf�, and he  has
    never deposited it in the bank because this is the money that he  lives
    on. If he paid it in, he would have to immediately withdraw it again so
    he doesn't see the point.   The Sponsor's employer  at  the  caf�  also
    attended the hearing to give evidence. He confirmed that  he  pays  the
    Sponsor weekly in cash.  The Tribunal noted the evidence of  HMRC  that
    the Sponsor declared and paid tax on a gross income  of  �25,560.76  in
    the relevant period. Having had regard to all of that, the Tribunal was
    satisfied that  the  Sponsor  does,  as  a  matter  of  fact,   earn  a
    sufficient amount of money to maintain and accommodate his family,  and
    to comply with the substantive requirements of Appendix FM.   It  could
    not however be satisfied that the Appellants had, at the  date  of  the
    application, complied with the requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE,  which
    sets out the 'specified evidence' to be  produced  before  any  claimed
    earnings  can  be  recognised.   Although  the  Tribunal  regarded  the
    Sponsor's stance on his cash earnings to be "understandable",  and  the
    effects of the rule to be "draconian", it held that it  was  unable  to
    ignore the evidential requirements in Appendix FM-SE.  The whole  point
    of the financial documentation is to establish that the Appellants meet
    the financial requirements of the rules.   The appeal  was  accordingly
    dismissed, the Tribunal finding no reason compelling reasons why  entry
    clearance should be granted 'outside of the rules'.


 7. In this appeal that conclusion of the First-tier Tribunal is challenged
    in two ways. First, Mr Greer submits  that  in  fact  there  was  scope
    within Appendix FM-SE/Appendix FM to find the rules met. Second, and in
    the alternative, it is submitted that having found that the Sponsor did
    in fact earn that money the Respondent could  not  show  the  continued
    refusal of entry clearance to be a proportionate response to  the  need
    to maintain immigration control, and on that basis  the  appeal  should
    have been allowed.



    The Rules

 8. The Immigration Rules are simply statements  of  policy,  made  by  the
    Secretary of State to explain the criteria by which  applications  will
    be judged. In 2012 the Secretary of State introduced  the  'new'  rules
    relating to Article 8, with the intention of clarifying and delineating
    where the balance should be struck when it came to the Article 8 rights
    of non-settled migrants seeking  to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom with family members. The substantive requirements  relating  to
    'suitability' and 'eligibility' are  set  out  in  Appendix  FM.    The
    procedural requirements  are  set  out  in  Appendix  FM-SE:  here  the
    Secretary of State sets out  the  'specified  evidence'  that  must  be
    produced upon application.   The requirements of Appendix FM-SE have in
    some cases given rise to results that appear harsh, or  as  the  First-
    tier Tribunal puts it, "draconian".  Applicants who otherwise  met  all
    of the relevant, substantive,  requirements have  for  instance  failed
    because they were unable to produce a specific  piece  of  paper.   For
    that reason Appendix FM-SE was amended to provide certain exceptions to
    the otherwise stringent evidential requirements.  Section D provides as
    follows:



         D (a) In deciding an application in relation to which this Appendix
         states  that  specified  documents  must  be  provided,  the  Entry
         Clearance Officer or Secretary of State ("the decision-maker") will
         consider documents that have been submitted with  the  application,
         and will only consider documents submitted  after  the  application
         where sub-paragraph (b), (e) or (f) applies.


         (b) If the applicant:


           (i) Has submitted:
              (aa) A sequence of documents and some of the documents in the
              sequence have been omitted (e.g. if one bank statement from a
              series is missing);


              (bb) A document in the wrong format (for example, if a letter
              is not on letterhead paper as specified); or


              (cc) DELETED


              (dd) A document which does not contain all of the specified
              information; or


           (ii) Has not submitted a specified document, the  decision-maker
           may contact the applicant or his representative  in  writing  or
           otherwise,  and  request  the   document(s)   or   the   correct
           version(s). The material  requested  must  be  received  at  the
           address specified in the request within a  reasonable  timescale
           specified in the request.


         (c) The decision-maker will not request documents where he or she
         does not anticipate that addressing the error or omission referred
         to in sub-paragraph (b) will lead to a grant because the
         application will be refused for other reasons.


         (d) If the applicant has submitted:
           (i) A document in the wrong format; or
           (ii) DELETED
           (iii) A document that does not contain all of the specified
           information, but the missing information is verifiable from:
                 (1) other documents submitted with the application,
                 (2) the website of the organisation which issued the
                 document, or
                 (3) the website of the appropriate regulatory body,


         the  application  may  be  granted  exceptionally,  providing   the
         decision-maker is satisfied that the  document(s)  is  genuine  and
         that the applicant meets the  requirement  to  which  the  document
         relates.


         (e) Where the decision-maker is satisfied that  there  is  a  valid
         reason why a specified document(s) cannot be supplied, e.g. because
         it is not issued in a particular country or  has  been  permanently
         lost,  he  or  she  may  exercise  discretion  not  to  apply   the
         requirement for  the  document(s)  or  to  request  alternative  or
         additional  information  or  document(s)  be   submitted   by   the
         applicant.


         (f) Before making a decision under Appendix FM  or  this  Appendix,
         the   decision-maker   may   contact   the   applicant   or   their
         representative  in  writing  or  otherwise   to   request   further
         information or documents. The material requested must  be  received
         at the  address  specified  in  the  request  within  a  reasonable
         timescale specified in the request.


 9. At paragraph 14 of its decision the First-tier Tribunal records that it
    was submitted on the Appellants' behalf  that  they  should  enjoy  the
    benefit of sub-paragraph (e).  At �15 it rejects  such  a  notion:  the
    'documents' - ie bank statements showing earnings deposited - were  not
    unavailable because of some insuperable obstacle, they were unavailable
    because the Sponsor had chosen not to pay his cash wages into the bank.


10. On appeal Mr Greer accepts that the case does not fall within the ambit
    of (e), but contends that in fact he  never  advanced  the  proposition
    that it did. Mr Greer, who was Counsel before the First-tier  Tribunal,
    submits that the only part of  FM-SE  that  he  relied  upon  was  sub-
    paragraph (D)(b)(i)(dd)[1]:  "a document which does not contain all  of
    the specified information".   Before I address this ground I  pause  to
    note this.  This proposition was not advanced in the  written  grounds,
    which were prepared by those instructing  Mr  Greer.  Mr  McVeety  very
    fairly made no objection to the grounds being amended and the  argument
    being put.   Nor did Mr McVeety  put  Mr  Greer  to  proof  as  to  his
    assertion about what was argued before the First-tier Tribunal. He  did
    so, and I permitted the point, on the basis that the rule is  the  rule
    and if the Appellants should have the benefit of it, then it  would  be
    an error of law to pretend otherwise.

11.  Having  said  all  of  that  I  struggle  to  see  that  sub-paragraph
    (D)(b)(i)(dd) is of much assistance to the Appellants  at  all.  It  is
    true that the bank statements did not contain  all  of  the  'specified
    information' but when the entire section is read that doesn't get  them
    very far. Where the applicant:

           (i) Has submitted:
            ...
              (dd) A document which does not contain all of the specified
              information; or


           (ii) Has not submitted a specified document, the  decision-maker
           may contact the applicant or his representative  in  writing  or
           otherwise,  and  request  the   document(s)   or   the   correct
           version(s). The material  requested  must  be  received  at  the
           address specified in the request within a  reasonable  timescale
           specified in the request.

    Had the ECO  contacted  the  Appellants  and  asked  for  the  "correct
    version", we know that this would not have  advanced  matters  at  all,
    since such a document does not exist.


12. Far more straightforward, it seems to me, would be  an  application  of
    sub-paragraph D(d)(iii)(1):


         (d) If the applicant has submitted:
           (i) A document in the wrong format; or
           (ii) DELETED
           (iii) A document that does not contain all of the specified
           information, but the missing information is verifiable from:
                 (1) other documents submitted with the application,
                 (2) the website of the organisation which issued the
                 document, or
                 (3) the website of the appropriate regulatory body,


         the  application  may  be  granted  exceptionally,  providing   the
         decision-maker is satisfied that the  document(s)  is  genuine  and
         that the applicant meets the  requirement  to  which  the  document
         relates.


13. The bank statements were before the Tribunal; they did not contain  all
    of  the  specified  information,  but  the  missing   information   was
    verifiable from the Sponsor's payslips, the statement of  his  employer
    and his tax records.  There was no question that  the  statements  were
    genuine, and that the applicants meet the  requirements  to  which  the
    document relates:  this  was  the  express  finding  of  the  Tribunal.
    Furthermore, by its own  estimation  the  Sponsor's  behaviour  in  not
    depositing  those  cash  wages  (only  to  withdraw  them  again)   was
    "understandable" [�13]; the effect, for this  genuine  family  who  are
    able to maintain themselves, was yet further interference. At the  date
    of the First-tier Tribunal decision over a year had  passed  since  the
    applications had been made, where husband was separated from wife,  and
    father from son. There were no countervailing factors at all. In  those
    circumstances I find that had the  Tribunal  directed  itself  to  sub-
    paragraph   D(d)(iii)(1)   it   would   have   allowed    the    appeal
    "exceptionally".  I set the decision aside, the error of  law  being  a
    failure to consider D(d)(iii)(1), and I remake  the  decision  allowing
    the appeal.




    Article 8


14. It follows that I need not dwell at  any  length  on  the  alternative,
    second ground,  that  having  found  the  substantive  requirements  of
    Appendix FM to be met the  Tribunal  should  have  allowed  the  appeal
    'outside of  the  rules'  since  there  was  nothing  weighing  on  the
    Respondent's side  of  the  scales  in  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise.  In  granting  permission  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Grant
    observed that the ratio of TZ & PG [2018] EWCA Civ 1109 does not appear
    to have been applied.    In response the ECO relies  on  the  oft-cited
    dictum of Lord Justice Laws in SS (Congo) and Ors [2015] EWCA  Civ  387
    to the effect that the procedural requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE  are
    there for a reason, that reason being  the  need  to  ensure  that  the
    applicant has sufficient funds: Laws LJ held that  since  the  evidence
    rules have that same general objective as the  substantive  rules,  the
    same approach must be taken to both. In the context of Article 8,  that
    required decision makers to only depart from the rules where there  are
    compelling reasons to do so.

15. SS (Congo) was of course one of the appeals before the Supreme Court in
    MM (Lebanon) & Ors. Unlike the other litigants, who all sought leave to
    remain in the United Kingdom, SS (Congo), like these Appellants, sought
    leave to enter. Unlike these Appellants, she was unable to  demonstrate
    that her Sponsor earned the minimum income required by the  rules.  One
    of the matters that the Court therefore had  to  consider  was  whether
    sources of income not provided for by the rules  could  be  taken  into
    account by decision makers in their wider consideration of  Article  8.
    Here the Court discusses the question of third-party support,  with  my
    emphasis added:

         99. Operation of the same restrictive approach outside the rules is
         a different matter, and in our  view  is  much  more  difficult  to
         justify under the HRA. This is not because "less intrusive" methods
         might be devised (as Blake  J  attempted  to  do:  para  147),  but
         because it is inconsistent with the character of  evaluation  which
         article 8 requires. As has been seen, avoiding a  financial  burden
         on the state can be relevant to the fair balance  required  by  the
         article. But that judgment cannot  properly  be  constrained  by  a
         rigid restriction in the rules. Certainly, nothing that is said  in
         the instructions to case  officers  can  prevent  the  tribunal  on
         appeal from looking at the  matter  more  broadly.  These  are  not
         matters of policy on which special weight has to be accorded to the
         judgment of the Secretary of State. There is nothing to prevent the
         tribunal, in the context of the HRA appeal, from judging for itself
         the reliability of any alternative sources of finance in the  light
         of the evidence before it. In doing  so,  it  will  no  doubt  take
         account of such considerations as those discussed by Lord Brown and
         Lord Kerr in Mahad, including the difficulties of proof highlighted
         in the quotation from Collins J. That being the position before the
         tribunal, it would make little sense  for  decision-makers  at  the
         earlier stages to be forced to take a narrower approach which  they
         might be unable to defend on appeal.

16. Before me Mr McVeety attempted  to  distinguish  this  passage  on  the
    facts: the Supreme Court was considering third party  support,  whereas
    here we are concerned with the cash income of a sponsor. I am unable to
    accept that the principle at stake - the fair balance to be  struck  by
    the Article - can be so constrained. The objective  -  to  ensure  that
    this couple are financially self- sufficient - is the same. In  MM  the
    Court held that decision-makers should be able  to  take  into  account
    promises of future support from  third  parties.   In   Mahad  v  Entry
    Clearance Officer [2009] UKSC 16 Lord Brown had properly described such
    promises as "unenforceable", "precarious" and "less easily  verifiable"
    than a sponsor's own legal entitlements,  but  the  Court  nevertheless
    held that where appropriate,  they should be weighed in the balance  in
    an Article 8 evaluation. Here the  rule  is  concerned  not  with  some
    future hope of income from external sources, but  with  monies  already
    earned: the Sponsor's wages  from  Selam  Internet  Caf�  were  neither
    unenforceable, precarious or less easily verified. To the contrary they
    were payments which the  Tribunal,  quite  properly  in  my  view,  had
    accepted to have been made. The  tax  records,  the  payslips  and  the
    credible evidence of two witnesses established that  to  be  the  case.
    If the First-tier Tribunal was concerned, as it was at its �17, to find
    an "exceptional" or "compelling" reason to allow the appeal,  that  was
    it.


17. If I am wrong about the application of  sub-paragraph  D(d)(iii)(1),  I
    would in the alternative allow the  appeal  on  the  grounds  that  the
    continuing decision to refuse leave is a disproportionate  interference
    with the family life of this father with his wife and young child.  The
    objective of the rules being met, the Entry  Clearance  Officer  simply
    could not show the continuing  interference  with  family  life  to  be
    justified.



      Decisions


18. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains material error of
    law and it is set aside.  I  remake  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by
    allowing the appeal on human rights grounds.


19. There is no order for anonymity in respect of the First Appellant,  but
    the Second Appellant is a minor.  Having had regard to Rule 14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  and  the  Presidential
    Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders I  therefore  consider  it
    appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Second  Appellant  is  granted  anonymity.   No  report  of   these
        proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  him.   This
        direction applies to, amongst others, both the  Appellant  and  the
        Respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction  could  lead  to
        contempt of court proceedings"
