For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decisions of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    G. Jones Q.C. promulgated on 19 December  2018  dismissing  the  appeal
    against a decision of the Respondent dated  26  October  2018  refusing
    protection in the U.K.

2.   The Appellant is a citizen  of  Morocco  born  on  15  July  1995.  She
    entered the UK in July 2013 pursuant  to  a  valid  visit  visa;  after
    approximately 6 weeks she returned to Morocco. She re-entered the UK on
    17 December 2013. On 18 January 2014 the Appellant made an  appointment
    with the Asylum Immigration Unit, and on 20 January 2014  she  attended
    her appointment and claimed asylum. A screening interview was conducted
    on the same day (Respondent's  bundle  Annex  C),  and  a  full  asylum
    interview was conducted on 3 February 2014 (Annex E). The  contents  of
    the interview were supplemented by a  witness  statement  signed  on  6
    February 2014 (Annex G).

3.   In support of her application the Appellant also relied  on  supporting
    medical evidence from the Helen Bamber Foundation (Annexes  H  and  I).
    The medical evidence opined that the Appellant exhibited  physical  and
    psychological signs of having  been  the  victim  of  serious  assault.
    Specifically, she claimed that her  father  had  thrown  acid  at  her,
    burning her upper thighs and pubic area because he had seen her talking
    to a boy. (In context this was not the exclusive basis of her claim for
    asylum, but was illustrative of her father's attitude  and  behaviour.)
    The medical evidence offered the opinion that the  Appellant  exhibited
    scars in her groin  that  were  highly  consistent  with  damage  by  a
    substance such as acid.

4.   The Respondent refused the Appellant's application for  protection  for
    reasons set out in a 'reasons for refusal'  letter  ('RFRL')  dated  26
    October 2018. It  was  accepted  that  the  Appellant  had  experienced
    physical violence from her father (RFRL at paragraph 37). It  was  also
    accepted that she had a genuine subjective fear  of  returning  to  her
    home area (paragraph 42). However, it was considered that the Appellant
    was not entitled to protection because she could reasonably be expected
    to avail herself of an internal relocation option (paragraphs 43-58).

5.   The Appellant appealed to the IAC.

6.   The appeal was dismissed for reasons set out in the Decision  of  Judge
    Jones Q.C.

7.   The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal,
    which was granted on 21 January 2019 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Gibb.

8.   Before me, on behalf of the Respondent,  Mr  Avery  conceded  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law, and  did
    not otherwise seek to  defend  it.  I  accept  that  concession.  After
    further discussion, and notwithstanding that significant aspects of the
    Appellant's history were not in dispute, it was common  ground  between
    the parties that the decision in the appeal should be  remade  after  a
    further hearing before the First-tier Tribunal. I am grateful  to  both
    representatives for the constructive discussion it was possible to have
    in respect of these matters.

9.   In the circumstances it is not necessary herein for me to  rehearse  in
    further detail the facts and circumstances of this case - which in  any
    event are a matter of record and known to the parties. I make reference
    to them only so far as is pertinent in  explaining  the  basis  of  the
    decision on error of law.

10.  Mr Avery acknowledged that there was not as much detail  in  the  First
    Tier Tribunal's decision as one might reasonably expect to see  in  the
    overall context of a case  such  as  this.  For  my  own  part,  I  was
    particularly struck by the fact that  the  nature  and  extent  of  the
    Appellant's ill-treatment by her father was not apparent from a reading
    of the decision. Mr Avery also acknowledged that the  apparent  absence
    of context undermined the  Judge's  effective  marginalisation  of  the
    supporting medical evidence with regard to the Appellant's capacity  to
    live an independent life in Morocco away from her father. Moreover, the
    Judge had seemingly failed to engage  with  the  Appellant's  assertion
    that her fear was not simply limited to her father, but  also  extended
    to other male extended family members. Yet  further,  it  was  accepted
    that there was substance in the criticisms in the grounds of  challenge
    that the Judge's consideration of country information had  been  slight
    and unduly selective.

11.  In isolation, there is some  substance  to  the  Judge's  reasoning  in
    respect of the value of the  medical  letter  dated  23  November  2018
    (paragraph 13). However, it seems to me that necessarily this does  not
    undermine the previous medical evidence.  The  Judge  marginalises  the
    previous medical evidence because of its date, and because "events have
    moved on" (paragraph 13). However, the Judge refers to  matters  having
    moved  on  "in  what  is  now  almost  a  period  of  five  years"   in
    circumstances where the report is dated February 2016. The  Judge  also
    marginalises the medical evidence on the basis that the  Appellant  has
    been able to attend courses in the UK. In my judgement the  ability  to
    attend English and art classes in the UK  is  not  in  itself  reliably
    indicative of an ability to "compete in the  local  labour  market"  in
    Morocco  (paragraph  19),  and  is  thereby  not  in  itself   reliably
    indicative of a level of recovery from PTSD symptoms commensurate  with
    an ability to establish herself independently. In order to reach such a
    conclusion something more detailed and  nuanced  by  way  of  reasoning
    would be required, which would in part necessitate expressly addressing
    and taking into account the Appellant's experiences at the hand of  her
    father, and her reaction to having been sexually 'pawed' by a suggested
    fiancï¿½ - and setting such matters in the context of societal  attitudes
    to women in Morocco. Such reasoning is absent from the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

12.  In all  such  circumstances  I  accept  the  substance  of  Mr  Avery's
    concession.

13.  Of course, the Appellant will now have an opportunity to update the
evidence upon which she wishes to rely - including in respect of any
treatment or therapy, or otherwise in respect of her current state of
health, be that physical or mental. However, I do not propose to issue any
specific Directions in the appeal. Standard Directions will suffice.



Notice of Decision

14.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
law and is set side.

15.  The decision in the appeal  is  to  be  remade  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal by any judge other than Judge G. Jones Q.C. with all issues at
    large.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
