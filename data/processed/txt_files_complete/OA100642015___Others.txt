Representation
For the Appellants:    Mr P Turner, counsel, instructed by Mamoon
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  appellants  are
granted  anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify them or any  member  of  their  family.  This  direction
applies both to the appellants and to  the  respondent.  Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


   1. The appellants are the mother and her three children born  on  7  July
      1974, 23 January 1999, 7 September 2002 and 7  March  2005.  They  are
      nationals of Pakistan.


   2. They  appeal  with  permission  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Holt who, in a decision promulgated on  3  August  2018
      dismissed their appeals against the  decision  of  the  respondent  to
      refuse their applications for an entry clearance to join their sponsor
      in the UK. He is the first appellant's husband and the father  of  the
      other appellants. He is in the UK working. He made an application  for
      his family who currently live in Pakistan to join him in  the  UK.  At
      the date of application, the second appellant was still a child but is
      now an adult [2].


   3. The first appellant's appeal was originally dealt with separately from
      the other appellants. Her appeal was dismissed by First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Pooler, following a hearing in Stoke on Trent on 5  April  2017.
      The appeals of the children appellants were  dismissed  by  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Lloyd Smith following a hearing  in  Manchester  on  19
      July 2016.


   4. On 15 December 2017 the Upper Tribunal decided to remit all the  cases
      back to the First-tier Tribunal for the  appeals  of  all  the  family
      members to be heard together.


   5. It was directed that there should be a fresh decision on all  matters.
      On 12 July 2018 the joint appeals came before First-tier Tribunal Holt
      at Manchester Piccadilly.


   6. She was satisfied that the sponsor and the appellants,  between  them,
      never fulfilled the Immigration Rules as the correct  bank  statements
      for the relevant period were never provided [22-23].


   7. Judge Holt stated that this was not the end of the matter however: The
      respondent  had  conceded  that  there  is  family  life  between  the
      appellants and their sponsor. She also accepted his evidence  that  he
      visits his family on holiday in Pakistan once a year.  However,  there
      is nothing exceptional about this arrangement which has been going  on
      for almost ten years. The family had chosen to live a  lifestyle  with
      the sponsor in the UK whilst the rest  of  the  family  are  based  in
      Pakistan. [24]


   8. She found that it is open to the appellants and sponsor to make  fresh
      applications if they wanted to although  the  eldest  child  would  no
      longer be eligible for consideration [24].


   9. She found nothing exceptional about the case which demanded assessment
      outside the Rules. She nonetheless considered the  case  applying  the
      Razgar "five stage test" [25].


  10. She found that the proposed decision  was  an  interference  with  the
      exercise  of  the  appellants'  right  to  respect  for  family  life.
      Consideration of whether or not such interference was necessary  in  a
      democratic  society  required   her   to   consider   the   issue   of
      proportionality. She found  that  it  was  entirely  proportionate  to
      refuse a case on the basis of failure  to  demonstrate  the  requisite
      income [27].


  11. She stated that "aligned" to the above, the fact that the eldest child
      - the second appellant - would now have to apply to enter the UK if he
      wanted to by another route 'is of scant relevance'. He is now an adult
      and apart from anything else '... there is no evidence whatsoever that
      his personal circumstances are so particular that he needs to come  to
      the UK along with his siblings and mother to  be  re-united  with  his
      father for reasons, such that deprivation of this opportunity would be
      so fundamental as to breach his Article 8 rights  outside  the  rules'
      [28].


  12. On 13 September 2018, Designated First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Macdonald
      granted the appellants permission to appeal. He found that  the  Judge
      gave clear reasons why the appellants did not satisfy the terms of the
      Immigration Rules. However, whilst she did refer to Razgar  and  found
      that there was no breach of the  family's  Article  8  rights,  it  is
      arguable that by  failing  to  consider  the  best  interests  of  the
      children as a primary consideration the Judge erred in law.


  13. Mr Turner, who did not represent the appellants before the  First-tier
      Tribunal, noted that there were two grounds of appeal. He referred  to
      the findings which begin at [21]. He submitted that the Judge erred in
      failing to consider the best  interests  of  the  children,  including
      those overseas, which is relevant in the  Article  8  assessment  -  R
      (OAO) MM (Lebanon) v SSHD [2017] UKSC 10.


  14. Moreover, the appellants' eldest son was under 18 years old  when  the
      application was made. He only  turned  18  after  a  decision  on  the
      application was made. However, the Judge erred in failing to  consider
      Article 8 and his best interests. He had  been  waiting  to  join  his
      sponsor father since 2015 and is now over the age of 18.


  15. Mr Turner noted that the Judge stated that she did not know  the  date
      that the  applications  were  submitted  [21].  She  stated  that  the
      applications were submitted some time after 5 April 2014 but before  5
      April 2015. She noted that the appellant had to provide the tax return
      for the last full tax year prior to the application.


  16. Mr Turner referred to [24] where, as  already  noted,  the  respondent
      conceded that there is family life between the  appellants  and  their
      sponsor. She accepted that he visits his family on holiday in Pakistan
      once a year and there is communication between  the  sponsor  and  his
      family and they stay in contact electronically.


  17. He submitted that the decision of the Tribunal in Mundeba  (Democratic
      Republic of Congo) (s.55  and  para  297(i)(f))  [2013]  UKUT  88  was
      clearly a "key case." The Judge was not referred  to  that  case.  The
      Upper Tribunal held that:


           "The exercise of the duty by  the  entry  clearance  officer  to
           assess an application under the Immigration Rules as to  whether
           there are family or  other  considerations  making  the  child's
           exclusion undesirable inevitably involves an assessment of  what
           the child's welfare and best interest require."


           Where an immigration decision  engages  Article  8  rights,  due
           regard must be had to the UN Convention on  the  Rights  of  the
           Child. An entry clearance decision for the admission of a  child
           under  18  is  "an   action   concerning   children...undertaken
           by...administrative authorities" and so by Article 3, "the  best
           interests of the child shall be a primary consideration."


           Family considerations  require  an  evaluation  of  the  child's
           welfare including emotional needs. "Other  considerations"  come
           into play where there are other aspects of a child's  life  that
           are serious and compelling, for example where  an  applicant  is
           living in an unacceptable social and economic  environment.  The
           focus needs to be on the circumstances of the child in the light
           of his or her age, social backgrounds and developmental  history
           and will involve inquiry as to whether:


                 a. there is evidence of neglect or abuse;


                 b. there are unmet needs that should be catered for;


                 c. there are stable arrangements for the  child's  physical
                 care;


           The  assessment  involves  consideration  as  to   whether   the
           combination  of  circumstances  are  sufficiently  serious   and
           compelling to require admission."


  18. He submitted that the eldest child's particular circumstances required
      a proper consideration and assessment. In  addition,  there  had  been
      substantial delay in this case. The applications were originally dealt
      with separately and then they came back together.


  19. He submitted that the finding at  [28],  namely,  the  fact  that  the
      eldest child would now have to apply to enter the UK if he  wanted  to
      by another route is of scant relevance, is "a nonsense". He  made  his
      application when he was under 18. Through  no  fault  of  his  own  he
      turned 18 at the time of the decision.


  20. In any event, family life does not end at the age  of  18.  There  was
      simply no consideration of his interests at all.


  21. In the circumstances the Judge ought to have had regard to  the  House
      of Lords decision in EB (Kosovo) v SSHD [2008] UKHL 41. Delay  in  the
      decision making process could be relevant to a claim to stay in the UK
      relying on Article 8. In this context, he submitted that if the  delay
      is shown to be the result  of  a  dysfunctional  system  which  yields
      unpredictable, inconsistent and unfair outcomes, then  it  may  reduce
      the weight to be given in the assessment  of  proportionality  to  the
      requirements of immigration control.


  22.  Mr  Turner  stated  that  the  Judge  found  that  it  was   entirely
      proportionate  to  refuse  the  case  on  the  basis  of  failure   to
      demonstrate the requisite income and their right to respect for family
      life. She accordingly found that  it  would  be  appropriate  for  the
      eldest son to be pared off. That finding, "definitely required  proper
      justification and reasoning based not only on his rights but also  the
      impact of separation on the other siblings." The second appellant  had
      still remained living as a family unit with the rest of his family  in
      Pakistan. Nor was there any other "identifiable route".


  23. There had thus  been  no  primary  consideration  given  to  the  best
      interests  of  the  appellants.  Although  they  did  not   meet   the
      requirements under Appendix FM-SE, the bank statement produced  showed
      receipts from sales in excess of �24,000 for the period 6  April  2014
      until 16 February 2015.


  24. On behalf of the  respondent,  Mr  Avery  submitted  in  his  Rule  24
      response that the Judge directed herself appropriately. She was  right
      to conclude that there were no exceptional matters  to  be  considered
      outside the Rules. Family life had been maintained at a  distance  for
      many years.


  25. The statement of the sponsor was short and did not address the  issues
      of the family. Nor was any additional evidence given at  the  hearing.
      Accordingly, nothing was put before the  Judge.  She  noted  that  the
      situation had been to maintain the status quo. That was a choice  that
      the family made to be separated. There was  no  evidence  relating  to
      adverse effects on any of the appellants.


  26. With regard to delay, he submitted that the appellants were not in the
      UK. This is accordingly not a relevant factor.


  27. In reply, Mr Turner repeated his submission that, having accepted that
      family life did exist in this case, the Judge was obliged to undertake
      a proper assessment of the children's best interests. Having regard to
      the delay in  making  the  decision,  there  needed  to  be  a  proper
      justification relating to the continued separation of  the  appellants
      from their sponsor. There was no analysis undertaken  in  relation  to
      the impact on the younger children. They were 13 and 16 at the time.


      Assessment


  28. I have set out the findings and reasoning of the Judge in some detail.
      In particular, having found that the appeal could  not  succeed  under
      the Rules,  she  accepted  that  there  is  family  life  between  the
      appellants and the sponsor.  She  referred  to  the  sponsor  visiting
      Pakistan on holiday once a year and stated that the family has  chosen
      to live a lifestyle with the sponsor in the UK.  She  noted  that  the
      sponsor's wife and dependent children  can  choose  to  make  a  fresh
      application if they want to. She noted that the second appellant would
      no longer be eligible for consideration.


  29. It was conceded that there was family  life  between  the  appellants,
      including him and the sponsor. That  was  the  context  in  which  the
      assessment under s.55  of  the  2007  Act  with  regard  to  the  best
      interests of the children, should have been made. There has not been a
      proper evaluation, particularly with regard to  the  younger  children
      who were 13 and 16 years old at the relevant time.


  30. The Judge stated at [28] that the fact that the second appellant would
      have to apply to enter the UK  by  another  route  now  'is  of  scant
      relevance'. However, she failed to take into account that at the  date
      of application he was under 18 years old, and there had been  a  delay
      before the decision was made.


  31. She compounded this error by stating that as an  adult,  there  is  no
      evidence whatsoever that his personal circumstances are so  particular
      that he needs to come  along  with  his  siblings  and  mother  to  be
      reunited with his father for reasons, such that  deprivation  of  this
      opportunity would be so fundamental as to breach his Article 8  rights
      outside the Rules.


  32. However, she did not take into account that the appellants  had  lived
      together as a family unit in Pakistan. The  fact  that  the  appellant
      turned 18 after the date of decision did not militate against the need
      to consider the impact upon him  and  the  others,  of  the  potential
      separation  from  this  family  unit.  Nor  was  there  any   evidence
      indicating that he was living an  independent  life  at  the  relevant
      time.


  33. I accordingly find  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      involved  the  making  of  an  error  on  a  point  of  law.  In   the
      circumstances, a fresh decision will have to be made. I  am  satisfied
      that the extent of judicial fact finding which is necessary  in  order
      for the decision to be re-made, is extensive.  In the circumstances  I
      find that it is just and fair to remit  the  case  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal for a fresh decision to be made.


      Notice of Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error on a point of law and is set aside.


      The  appeal  is  remitted  to  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  (Manchester
      Piccadilly) for a fresh decision to be made by another Judge.


      Anonymity direction made.
