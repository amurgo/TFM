                           DETERMINATION & REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Dawn Baker), sitting at Newport on 23 November 2010, to
     an asylum and human rights  appeal  by  a  Fulani  citizen  of  Guinea
    (capital Conakry), born in 1983. Following  the  hearing  on  19  April
    2012, I decided that, however understandably in the circumstances,  she
    had made an error of law, which required a re-hearing of at least  part
    of the case. This could not be listed before me at Newport till 27 June
    2013. In order to follow the challenges to the judge's decision, it  is
    necessary first to set out the relevant history.



 2. History   The appellant claims a history of  political  involvement  in
    Guinea, much of which can be  taken  from  the  chronology  before  the
    judge. On 8 and 16  June  2006  he  had  attended  two  demonstrations,
    without apparently getting into any trouble over either of them.  On  6
    December 2006, someone made a visit visa  application  at  the  British
    Embassy in Brussels, in the name of Thierno Mamoudou Bah, born in 1978,
    but on the basis of a photograph which the  appellant  admitted  before
    the judge was his: the visa was granted.

 3. On 10 January 2007 the  appellant  went  on  another  demonstration  in
    Conakry: this time troops  came  to  his  family  house  that  evening,
    looking for him; however he escaped, and went to stay with friends.  On
    the 23rd his step-father (who it turns out was also his paternal uncle)
    called him, and told him a warrant had been issued for his arrest: what
    is said to be a copy of this document is dated 22 January 2007,  headed
    'Notes de Recherche', and has been translated 'Search  Notice':  it  is
    signed by the juge d'instruction (investigating judge)  Mamady  Camara,
    and the deputy public prosecutor, and instructs all public  authorities
    to find Amadou Bah, and seek the judge's instructions if found. I shall
    refer to it as the 2007 warrant.

 4. The appellant's step-father's instructions to him were to stay where he
    was, and have photographs taken (see paragraph 16  of  his  statement).
    The appellant's step-father then made arrangements through an agent for
    him to leave Guinea, and in March 2007 the appellant  arrived  in  this
    country. He accepted at interview that  the  passport  with  which  the
    agent had provided him might have been in the name of Thierno  Mamoudou
    Bah: Home Office records show that the holder of a passport and visa in
    that name was given leave to enter at Gatwick on 1 March. The appellant
    says he was detained for two days, and then went to stay with a  friend
    in Gloucester.

 5. On 3 April 2009 the appellant was arrested  in  London  as  an  illegal
    entrant, and  claimed  asylum:  he  was  nevertheless  given  temporary
    admission, to stay with his friend in Gloucester. In December  2009  he
    went to see an organization called 'Gloucestershire Action for Refugees
    and Asylum Seekers' [GARAS], as shown in an undated letter from them to
    the Home Office. The appellant wanted to know what had happened to  his
    asylum application: 'extensive enquiries' by GARAS with the Immigration
    Service eventually showed that the appellant had been recorded  by  the
    Home Office as an absconder. GARAS finally got through to the absconder
    team, who told them the appellant should write in with representations,
    if he wanted to proceed with his claim.

 6. At this point, as  GARAS  say,  the  appellant  decided  to  apply  for
    voluntary  assisted  return,  and  there  was  before  the   judge   an
    application at p 27, signed both by him and GARAS on 8 February 2010. I
    shall return at 23 to the evidence before me about hos this came about.
    Curiously enough, although both the Home  Office  and  GARAS  had  been
    dealing with him in 2009 - 10 under his present  name  of  Amadou  Bah,
    both the application for voluntary assisted return, and,  according  to
    Home Office records, the passport sent in with it, are in the  name  of
    Thierno Mamoudou Bah. The passport bore the same number as the one used
    in that name for the 2006 visa application in Brussels.



 7. On 4 March 2010 the appellant claims he left this country, and  arrived
    in Guinea. There is no documentary evidence before me to show that  his
    application for voluntary assisted return  was  processed;  or  of  his
    travel arrangements: on 27 June 2012 what was said to be a copy of  the
    Thierno Mamoudou Bah passport was produced, to which  I  shall  return.
    In Guinea the appellant claims he was detained for 25 days on  arrival,
    until on the night of 29  -  30  March  2012  he  was  released,  under
    arrangements made  by  his  step-father;  but  on  1  April  a  summons
    (convocation) was issued by  the  commandant  of  a  gendarmerie  unit,
    requiring him to present himself to them on the 5th. It  is  not  clear
    when the appellant received this document;  but  he  says  he  flew  to
    Brussels, under further private arrangements made  by  his  step-father
    through an agent, on 19 May.

 8. On 20 May 2010 the appellant says he landed  in  Brussels  and  claimed
    asylum; but his application was not  accepted,  as  he  had  previously
    claimed in this country, and he  was  removed  here  under  the  Dublin
    Convention on 5 July. The Home Office do not accept that he  ever  went
    back to Guinea in 2010; but this removal is accepted, since the details
    of his flight from Brussels on 5 July are typed into the record of  his
    screening interview, otherwise completed by hand the same day.

 9. Following the appellant's screening interview, and despite the mode  of
    his return, he was not detained, but sent to  Cardiff  under  dispersal
    arrangements on 4 August 2010, and  fully  interviewed  on  16  August.
    Following that interview, he was refused asylum and a decision made  to
    remove him on 13 September. In the refusal letter, the Home Office case
    was presented in the alternative: either on the basis that he  was  the
    Thierno Mamoudou Bah who had applied for and got a British  visit  visa
    in Brussels in 2006; or that he was not that person. By the time of the
    hearing before the judge on 23 November  it  had  been  established  by
    comparison of finger-prints that the appellant was not the  person  who
    had made that application, and so that claim by  the  Home  Office  was
    withdrawn.

10. Appeal to Upper Tribunal      The appellant's  main  ground  of  appeal
    before me was that, on the basis  of  the  concession  made  about  the
    finger-prints, the judge was not  entitled  to  reach  the  conclusions
    against him which she did at paragraphs 35 - 43. In my view this showed
    a failure to understand the judge's decision or the  Home  Office  case
    (though this might have been presented more clearly than it was  before
    her). It was not necessarily the case that the person who made the visa
    application in Brussels in December 2006, and the one who arrived  here
    in March 2007 were one and the same; and we now  know,  thanks  to  the
    finger-prints, that they were not.

11. On the other hand, the appellant accepted that the photographs produced
    on the visa application were of him, and that the passport on which  he
    arrived in this country was in the name of Thierno Mamoudou Bah. In  my
    view the judge was fully entitled to infer, as she  did,  that,  though
    the application was not made in person by the appellant in Brussels  on
    6 December 2006, it was made for his benefit.  While  finger-prints  of
    visitors  are  not  routinely  checked  on  arrival,  the   appellant's
    appearance would certainly have been compared with  the  photograph  on
    the passport on which he arrived.



12. As will be remembered (see  3),  the  appellant  first  claims  he  was
    actively wanted by the Guinean authorities following his involvement in
    the demonstration of 10 January 2007; and it was following the news  of
    the warrant issued for his arrest on the 23rd that his step-father told
    him to get photographs taken.  Those  photographs  could  not,  on  the
    appellant's version of events, have been the ones used to get the  visa
    on 6 December 2006, and the judge was fully entitled to reject his case
    about why he had to leave Guinea in January 2007.

13. That was not the end of this appeal, however, because there  was  still
    the appellant's claim about the events following his return  to  Guinea
    in March 2010 to be dealt with. At paragraph 51 the judge rejected  his
    case on this too, partly because of the findings which in my  view  she
    was entitled to reach on the events of 2006 -  07;  but  she  had  also
    pointed out, at paragraph 50, that there was  no  credible  explanation
    from him about why he should have chosen to return to Guinea in 2010 if
    those events had happened; and, at paragraph 51, that he  had  provided
    no evidence, other than what he said himself, to show that he had flown
    there then at all. All of  these,  standing  alone  or  together,  were
    conclusions she was fully entitled to reach, and the last two  did  not
    depend on her findings on the 2006 - 07 events.

14. However, these were not the only points taken by  the  judge:  she  had
    already spent some considerable time in dealing with ones about

      a) the 'country expert' evidence before her.
         This is no longer relied on, following a detailed ruling I gave  on
         it on 24 April 2012; instead there is a  fresh  report  from  Emily
         Lynn Osborn, assistant professor of history at  the  University  of
         Chicago, to which I shall return; and
      b) the appellant's dealings with GARAS in 2009 - 10

    and points were taken on appeal about her treatment of these too.

15. (a)      As I noted in my previous ruling, the judge was understandably
    led into error by careless mistakes made by  the  appellant's  previous
    main 'country expert', Ticky Monekosso; but no more need be said  about
    that now, except to express the hope that  no-one  will  ever  put  her
    forward in that capacity again.

16. (b)             The judge recorded  the  appellant's  case  before  her
    about how he came to withdraw his asylum claim and apply for  voluntary
    assisted return in 2007 in the terms set out at  paragraph  24  of  his
    statement: GARAS told him the Home Office were not going to process his
    claim; so he went to the Gloucester Law Centre  and  spoke  to  someone
    called Andy, who advised him that there was nothing  to  be  done.  The
    judge saw  a  contradiction  between  this  and  what  GARAS  had  said
    themselves. There is now before me a letter of 13 June 2013 from  Mr  A
    Puddicombe of the Gloucester Law Centre, who Mr Richards  was  able  to
    confirm is known as Andy, and I shall return to that shortly.

17. In a record of GARAS's dealings with him, they set out a first visit on
    9 December 2009, when he complained of having heard  nothing  from  the
    Home Office since his arrest and claim  in  April.  An  advice  officer
    called Farouq Ginwalla rang the Home Office, who told him the appellant
    had failed to turn up for an interview, and had  been  recorded  as  an
    absconder. Eventually on 22 December Mr  Ginwalla  managed  to  get  in
    touch  with  the  absconder  team,  who  suggested   he   should   make
    representations to them, if he wanted to proceed  with  his  claim.  Mr
    Ginwalla drafted a letter for the appellant to take  with  him  to  the
    Gloucester Law Centre, where he had an appointment on 13 January 2010.

18. On 18 January 2010  the  appellant  came  back  to  GARAS,  saying  the
    solicitor he had seen at the Law  Centre  had  told  him  he  could  do
    nothing: he wanted to apply for voluntary assisted return (the  undated
    letter from Mr Ginwalla records that "At this point the client  decided
    that he would like to go back  rather  than  stay  here,  and  make  an
    application to go back with IOM  [the  International  Organization  for
    Migration]"): after refusing at first, because he was still  on  record
    as an absconder,  IOM  had  eventually  approved  his  application  for
    voluntary assisted return on 1 March. Another advice  worker  at  GARAS
    records that IOM were then given the  appellant's  mobile  number,  and
    were to contact him directly.

19. A voluntary assisted return application, signed by the  appellant,  and
    countersigned by Mr Ginwalla on  19  January  2010,  gives  his  asylum
    status as "application pending", in preference to other alternatives on
    the form, and his reasons for wishing to return as

       Asylum system not working - have been without support and chances not
       good

    The form also includes a declaration (repeated in the one reproduced at
    p 27 on 8 February) that

       I understand that, by returning with IOM's Voluntary Assisted  Return
       and  Reintegration  Programme,  I  will  be  withdrawing  my   asylum
       application in the UK.

    Both documents give the appellant's real name as Thierno Mamoudou  Bah,
    while the application form shows Amadou Bah as an alias. At the top  of
    the first page of the application someone has written "Rejected".

20. The judge (paragraphs 48 - 49) regarded the appellant's acknowledgement
    that he did have a asylum application pending as directly contradicting
    what he said he had been told by the Gloucester Law Centre,  which  she
    set out as follows

       He has sought to explain that he was advised that he could  not  make
       his asylum claim as noted above and that Gloucester Law  Centre  told
       him his claim would not be successful and he understood  he  did  not
       have a claim pending,.

21.  At this point it is necessary  to  go  into  what  the  appellant  had
    actually said in his statement (p 9, paragraph 24).  It  is  not  clear
    from the judge's account of his oral evidence at paragraph 18  how,  if
    at all, he had added to or explained that before her. What he  said  in
    his statement was that

       After GARAS told me the Home Office were  not  going  to  process  my
       claim, I did seek legal advice. I went to Gloucester  Law  Centre.  I
       remember speaking there to someone called Andy. He told me there  was
       nothing they could do. That is when I got really upset and decided to
       return to Guinea.



22. While there may be several ways of  saying,  in  legal  language,  that
    nothing can be done, I  did  not  think  this  account  of  events  was
    necessarily  different  from  the  account  of  advice  given  to   the
    appellant, as recorded in the IOM application form,  that  his  chances
    were not  good.  As  the  judge  noted,  there  was  no  evidence  from
    Gloucester Law Centre to show what they told him; but neither was there
    anything to show that the appellant was saying that they  told  him  he
    had no claim at all. The earliest account given of his case,  following
    the appointment he said he had at the law centre on 13 January, was  in
    the statement countersigned, and very likely drafted by Mr Ginwalla  on
    the 18th, which suggested that he had been told that his  chances  were
    not good.

23. The letter from Mr Puddicombe now confirms that he saw the appellant on
    13 January, and took initial  details  from  him,  without  giving  any
    advice at that stage; but a colleague had seen him  on  the  19th,  and
    told him that "... on the facts given, any asylum claim  that  he  made
    was unlikely to be successful at that time".

24. Scope of re-hearing    Taken together with the  judge's  understandable
    mistake caused by Miss Monekosso's evidence, I regarded  her  treatment
    of these points as errors of law which required a re-hearing;  but  not
    of the whole case. As I have already made clear at 12 - 13,  the  judge
    was fully entitled to her findings of fact about the events of December
    2006 (when she found someone got the visit  visa  in  Brussels  on  the
    appellant's behalf) and January 2007 (when  she  consequently  rejected
    his account of being pursued by the police).

25. Those findings were to stand, and  the  re-hearing  was  mainly  to  be
    concerned with the events of 2010, and in particular, as it turned out,
    the following questions[1]:

      a) Did the appellant board a flight in this  country  on  or  about  4
         March, arriving in Guinea the same day, and, if so, was he detained
         by the police on arrival?
     b) If so, was that reasonably likely to have had anything to  do  with
        his history of attending demonstrations in 2006,  without  apparent
        consequences, on which the judge made no express findings?
     c) Is his claimed arranged escape on 29 - 30 March consistent with the
        issue of a summons against him by the gendarmerie on 4  April,  and
        is that summons reasonably likely to be genuine?
RE-HEARING

26.  Appellant's history         This is what the appellant  said  in  oral
    evidence about his activities in 2006: in June the  trade  unions  were
    organizing  demonstrations  against  the  then  military  regime.   The
    appellant first took part in one on 8 June: his r�le was as  leader  of
    the young people from his area, and they all went  to  join  a  protest
    meeting at a big stadium,  carrying  placards  saying  'Down  with  the
    Army'. However while they were still on  their  way  there,  they  were
    stopped by the police: later they learnt that people had been  shot  in
    the Bambato area. Next he went on another  demonstration  on  16  June:
    this time they had slogans on their T-shirts.  The  appellant  was  not
    arrested on either of these occasions; but he said he came to know that
    the chief of his Bombola area had identified him as a ring-leader.

27. Cross-examined  about the 2006 incidents, the  appellant  confirmed  he
    had been the leader of his local anti-military group: then he was asked
    about what he had said at paragraph 13 of (2)

       A friend of mine was the leader of this group - ELHADJI BARRY.

    The appellant's answer was that there might have been a mistake on  the
    part of the interpreter. This was of course the interpreter used by his
    then solicitors, who at the end of the  statement  gave  his  name  and
    signed an endorsement "I have read this statement back to the client in
    French".

28. In the appellant's second witness statement  (2)  of  22  October  2010
    (confirming, with some comments, what he had said in statement (1) - 13
    August 2010 - and at interview), he dealt with what followed the events
    of June 2006. The appellant said there was no more for him to do on the
    political front; so he went on helping his father in the  family  shop:
    he had explained in (1) that his father and brother had been killed  in
    a car crash in 2006. Three months later  his  mother  had  married  his
    paternal uncle[2], who had taken over the shop, and whom he regarded as
    his father from then on.

29. It was on 6 December that, as  the  judge  found,  someone  applied  in
    Brussels for a British visit visa for the appellant, impersonating  him
    and using his photograph, and the  passport  in  the  name  of  Thierno
    Mamoudou Bah, of which a partial copy has  now  been  produced  by  the
    appellant. The visa itself can be seen, indistinctly, on the copy;  but
    the focus in evidence before me was on p  7  of  the  passport.  Stamps
    showing the following can be seen on this: first there are  oval  ones,
    showing that someone using the passport had entered Guinea

     a) on 26 December 2006             (the last figure  is  unclear;  but
        that date fits both the obtaining of the visa, and the using of the
        passport by someone to gain entry to this country on 1 March 2007);
        and

     b) on 4 March 2010    (all very clear this time)

    Then there is

    (c)       a faint trace of a  horizontal  rectangular  one,  only  just
        visible over the watermark at the bottom of the page.

30. The appellant went on to say that a photocopy of  this,  the  visa  and
    personal details pages of this passport had been sent  to  him  by  his
    paternal uncle, after the Home Office had  challenged  his  account  of
    going back to Guinea in 2010: a  copy  of  the  DHL  waybill  was  also
    produced. He said that his uncle had got it from the man who had helped
    him on his way here in 2007, who worked at the airport in  Guinea;  but
    he hadn't been able to get the passport itself, so far as the appellant
    knew.

31. Mr Richards suggested that the 2010 entry stamp might have been put  on
    to a concocted photocopy: the appellant said he didn't  know  how  that
    might have been done, so I explained to him the quite simple process of
    applying a false rubber stamp to a copy, and  then  copying  the  copy.
    However the appellant insisted that the photocopy had  reached  him  in
    the way already set out. He agreed that there were three stamps on p 7,
    though he could not explain stamp (c). The appellant  went  on  to  say
    that he had never seen the Thierno Mamoudou  Bah  passport  itself,  as
    someone who had been waiting outside the airport had had it  back  from
    the person who came with him in 2007

32. Contrary to the judge's findings, the appellant  claimed  in  (2),  and
    elsewhere, that he had taken part in demonstrations in  Conakry  on  10
    and 22 January 2007: he gave details of those in  (1).  There  he  also
    claimed that the Army had come to his house looking for him  after  the
    second of those demonstrations; so he  had  gone  to  lie  low  at  his
    cousin's. In March, with the help of bribes paid by his uncle,  he  had
    flown to this country, stopping only in transit.

33. Someone using the Thierno Mamoudou Bah passport  certainly  arrived  in
    this country on 1 March 2007;  but  the  appellant  himself  was  first
    recorded here on 4 April 2009, under the name he now uses, Amadou  Bah.
    He had been arrested in Gloucester; later he was seen by an immigration
    officer and interviewed under caution on the 5th.  He  is  recorded  as
    saying that he had last entered this country on 1 January 2009, with  a
    friend of his uncle's, whose name he didn't know:  they  had  travelled
    direct from Banjul in the Gambia.

34. The appellant went on to say at a screening interview the same day that
    "... he had travelled to Banjul from Guinea in  2007  after  his  Uncle
    managed to arrange his release from  Prison  with  one  of  the  Prison
    guards. ... he had worked in Banjul in his friend's Uncle's shop  prior
    to coming to the UK." When asked about these  interviews,  he  said  he
    hadn't  told  the  immigration  officer  any  of  this;   perhaps   the
    interpreter was getting it wrong, as he (the  appellant)  was  speaking
    French.

35. Following the appellant's interviews in April  2009,  he  was  accepted
    into the asylum process; but, for one reason or another,  it  seems  he
    came to be recorded as an absconder, which is why  the  Gloucester  Law
    Centre declared themselves unable to help  him  further.  There  is  no
    reason not to accept GARAS  and  the  Law  Centre's  records  of  their
    dealings with him in December 2009 and January 2010, set out  at  16  -
    23.

36. In oral evidence the appellant explained that he had been homeless  and
    with no money to buy food when he had gone to see GARAS. However,  when
    he heard the Home Office had closed his case, and IOM had rejected  his
    application for voluntary assisted return, he had called  his  paternal
    uncle to send him the price of a ticket home.  His  uncle,  instead  of
    sending him the money direct, had sent it to or with a  lady  known  to
    him only as Madame Diallo, who had not only helped him get the  ticket,
    but gone with him all the way back to Guinea.





37. All the appellant said he could remember about his journey of  4  March
    2010 was that the plane had taken off about 0800, from which airport he
    didn't remember, and taken him to Paris,  where  he  had  changed  onto
    another, which reached Conakry between 1945 - 2000. If there  had  been
    any doubt about the possibility of such an  itinerary,  it  would  have
    been resolved by a print-out before me of a current quotation from  the
    Air France site: arrival at Conakry at 1745 can now be achieved by  way
    of Paris, leaving Heathrow on flights at various times between 0710 and
    1010, at a total one-way fare of �1030.

38. Cross-examined about his journey, the appellant  said  Mme  Diallo  had
    called him in Gloucester, where he was living, on 1 March, and told him
    to come up to London two days before the flight. In due course a friend
    bought him a bus ticket, and Mme Diallo had been  waiting  for  him  at
    Victoria; then they had caught  another  bus  to  Lewisham,  where  she
    lived. At 0600 a friend of hers picked them up in his car and took them
    to the airport.

39. On landing in Guinea, the appellant said first his passport was  taken;
    then his finger-prints. After about three hours, the officials  dealing
    with him came and asked for his name, presumably meaning his present or
    real name, since they did not accept that he was the  Thierno  Mamoudou
    Bah named on the passport he was using. The officials said if he didn't
    give it, they would still find it out sooner or later. So  far  as  his
    family were concerned, his uncle knew he was coming on that flight, but
    it was impossible to get in touch from  air-side  with  anyone;  so  he
    remained in  custody,  without  his  passport.  However  the  appellant
    believed Mme Diallo, who had been able to enter Guinea herself, had got
    in touch with his uncle and let him know what had happened to him.

40. In statements (3) and (4), the  appellant  gave  details  of  the  ill-
    treatment, overcrowding and squalid conditions he said he had  suffered
    in detention on return to Guinea. However during the night of 29  -  30
    March 2010 his uncle was able to arrange  for  his  escape,  which,  he
    explained in his oral evidence, had been effected through  a  guard  he
    had paid off with about Guinea Francs 3m[3]. The guard  had  come  into
    his cell (which he said in (3) he shared with about ten other men), and
    told him to put on the uniform he was carrying,  and  follow  him:  the
    appellant was to leave the country, or the guard would get into trouble
    himself. For some reason the appellant was also  required  to  smoke  a
    cigarette, given him by the guard.

41. When the two of them arrived at the back gate of the prison, the  guard
    told the appellant to go on out, and his uncle would be waiting for him
    in a car close by, which he was, with the appellant's cousin, to  whose
    house he was taken. There he stayed for about six months - he must have
    meant weeks, since he landed in Brussels on 20 May -  until  his  uncle
    was able to arrange a Belgian visa for him for a very much  larger  sum
    than had been needed for the guard, the equivalent of �6,000. Meanwhile
    on 1 April the summons (see 7) was brought to  the  appellant's  family
    house, where his uncle and  mother were living; but since the appellant
    was not to be found there, the police officers who brought it  left  it
    with his uncle. The appellant said he would be afraid for his  life  if
    he returned to Guinea, given what had happened to him as  a  result  of
    his organizing demonstrations in the past.

42. Cross-examined, the appellant said he didn't know what passport he  had
    used to get to Belgium, since Ibrahim, his uncle's agent, had showed it
    to the immigration officers, and kept it afterwards; but  it  did  have
    his photograph in it. When he claimed asylum, the appellant said he had
    given his real name of  Amadou  Bah  to  the  Belgian  authorities.  He
    accepted that his troubles in 2006 had come from his opposition to  the
    then military government, which had since been replaced by  a  civilian
    President, Alpha Kond�. However  the  appellant  said  he  didn't  know
    whether Kond� had been for or against the military government  himself;
    but recent demonstrations, in which 12 people had  been  killed,  meant
    that he was still afraid to return.

43. History of Guinea            I have taken this partly from the 'Freedom
    House' extract on Guinea, dated 16 January 2013, to which  Mr  McCarthy
    referred me, and partly from  Professor  Osborn's  report.  Guinea  was
    ruled from independence from France in 1957 by President  S�kou  Tour�,
    till his death in 1984.  Then  a  military  junta,  led  by  Lt-Colonel
    Lansana Cont�, took over and manipulated the democratic process  so  as
    to remain in power  till  he  too  died  in  December  2008,  following
    widespread demonstrations and the declaration of martial law in 2007.

44. On the death of Cont�, Capt Moussa Dadis Camara took over as  President
    in a coup, but promised to hold elections in  2010.  Demonstrations  in
    September 2009 were suppressed with some savagery, and in December that
    year Camara was shot and wounded by the commander of his  guard,  since
    when he has been under  treatment  or  in  exile  abroad.  The  defence
    minister, Gen Sekouba Konat�, took over, with Jean-Marie  Dor�  of  the
    Prodemocracy party as interim civilian Prime Minister.

45. Elections in June 2010 led to a narrow overall victory for Alpha  Cond�
    of the RPG party, from  the  Malinke  tribe,  in  a  run-off,  held  in
    December 2010,  following  which  Cond�  was  sworn  in  as  President:
    Professor Osborn says there  were  suspicions  that  the  military  had
    helped to rig the result in his favour. Despite those suspicions,  what
    Professor Osborn describes as 'hostility from within the military'  led
    to a coup attempt against  President  Cond�  in  July  2011,  which  he
    managed to defeat.

46. In the 2010 run-off, President Cond� had narrowly [52.5: 47.5%]  beaten
    Cellou Dalein Diallo, of the UFDG party, and a Fulani. Diallo lives  in
    Senegal; but in April 2011 he made a visit to Conakry, where a crowd of
    over 5,000 of his mainly Fulani  supporters  were  at  the  airport  to
    welcome him. However, the event turned sour when troops  fired  on  the
    crowd, killing four and wounding 20: 70 people were arrested, but there
    was no official investigation afterwards. Nor have there  so  far  been
    any legal proceedings following  the  arrest  of  25  soldiers  and  13
    civilians over the July  coup  attempt.  Meanwhile  Diallo  remains  in
    Senegal.


47. Professor Osborn's opinions         Professor  Osborn  sought  to  help
    answer the following (now re-numbered) questions of fact I posed in  my
    preliminary ruling:

      a) Was the appellant detained by the police on arrival  in  Guinea  in
         March 2010?
      b) If so, was that reasonably likely to have had anything to  do  with
         his history of attending demonstrations in 2006,  without  apparent
         consequences, on which the judge made no express findings?
      c) Is his claimed arranged escape on 29 - 30 March consistent with the
         issue of a summons against him by the gendarmerie on 4  April,  and
         is that summons reasonably likely to be genuine?

48. (a)             Professor Osborn  records  much  the  same  account  of
    events from a telephone interview she had had with the appellant  on  4
    June as he gave in evidence on the 27th: whether the appellant had told
    his family members in general, or just his  paternal  uncle,  does  not
    perhaps matter, since the remainder of Professor  Osborn's  conclusions
    on this point are predicated on the assumption  that  "It  is  possible
    that word traveled about his return to Guinea  and  that  soldiers  and
    government officials received word  that  a  person  of  interest   [my
    emphasis] was arriving at the airport".

49. Professor Osborn goes on to say that she considers it unlikely that any
    information system existed by which the officials at the airport  could
    in a few hours have linked the person arriving on the Thierno  Mamoudou
    Bah passport in 2010 to the Amadou Bah who had been  arrested  back  in
    2006, without his telling them himself he was that  person.  She  notes
    that his Fulani tribe have met great hostility from the  government  in
    recent years, despite changes in the r�gime; and that

       Given the abysmal state of Guinea's justice  system  ...  it  is  not
       unlikely that [the appellant] could have been  ...  held  ...  as  he
       described, until the end of March 2010, when his  uncle  orchestrated
       his escape from prison.

50. (b)      Professor  Osborn  notes  the  history  of  events  since  the
    appellant left Guinea in 2006, and his return (as he claims) "... at  a
    time when the country was under considerable  international  scrutiny".
    She goes on to opine that

       Despite that pressure, it is not unlikely that low-level  bureaucrats
       (who were likely of Malinke and Soussou ethnicity) who worked at  the
       airport and elsewhere sought to mitigate [sc. 'militate']  against  a
       possible "Fulani" take-over of  the  government.  And  so  they  were
       particularly attentive to anyone, particularly able-bodied young  men
       who had lived abroad, who might have the  capacity  to  mobilize  and
       influence Fulani voters.

    Professor Osborn goes on to deal with events back in  2005  -  07;  but
    here I see no need to go further into what she says  than  Mr  McCarthy
    found it necessary to refer me, which I shall do in due course.

51. (c)      The point of this question, which I should have thought  would
    have been obvious, even for  an  academic  without  legal  training  or
    experience, was to find out whether  there  were  any  reason  why  the
    Guinean authorities should have issued a summons, rather than a warrant
    of arrest, on 4 April 2010, for someone  who  they  well  knew  was  at
    large, and so unlikely to answer a summons, following his  escape  from
    their custody on the night of 29 - 30 March.  The  distinction  between
    the two processes is not only the same in American and  English  common
    law, but one also drawn in the criminal procedure of Guinea,  no  doubt
    following a French model: see the  descriptions  of  the  2007  warrant
    ('Notes de Recherche') at 3, and the 2010 summons ('convocation') at 7.

52.  Instead  of  confronting  this  point,  and  either   providing   some
    explanation for it from her  knowledge  of  Guinea,  or  declaring  her
    inability to do so, Professor Osborn says this (at paragraph 27):

       I cannot attest to the authenticity of the document [the summons].  I
       am able to attest to the working of Guinea's prison system and to the
       arbitrariness of the judicial system.

    She offers further details about the judicial system  in  an  appendix;
    but none of them sheds any light on the question asked. Again  I  shall
    deal with Professor Osborn's further comments  as  referred  to  by  Mr
    McCarthy.

53. Submissions     Mr Richards's submissions were short, and  directed  to
    the main point in issue, which is the appellant's  credibility,  so  my
    not dealing with them further means no criticism of  him.  Mr  McCarthy
    filed a lengthy skeleton argument: section A, dealing with credibility,
    addresses the points made against this appellant with reference to some
    authorities, so well-worn as to be trite. However, in one case, partial
    citation has given an impression of disingenuousness: no doubt  nothing
    worse than carelessness was involved, but the position needs to be  put
    right.

54. What is put forward as a direct citation from PK (EEA  regs:  Jia)  Sri
    Lanka [2008] UKAIT 00043 is a secondary one, from a much older decision
    (Chiver (Asylum;  Discrimination;  Employment;  Persecution)  (Romania)
    [1994] UKIAT 10758) which should not now be used without  referring  to
    the explanation given in PK: the passage  cited  appears  in  quotation
    marks, and the reference to 'adjudicator', anachronistic even in  2008,
    is the give-away, for those with long memories.

       It is perhaps worth saying again what Chiver decides,  as  it  is  so
       often misstated in general, although we are glad to say  seldom  with
       the mendacious particularity adopted here.  Chiver was an  appeal  by
       the Secretary of State against the determination  of  an  adjudicator
       who had allowed an appeal despite having  concerns  about  particular
       aspects of the credibility of the appellant's story.   The  Secretary
       of State argued essentially that, given the  concerns  that  he  had,
       some of which were unresolved, the adjudicator was wrong in  law,  on
       the evidence before him as he assessed it, to allow the  appeal.   On
       that issue the decision of the Tribunal was that:

           "It is perfectly possible for an adjudicator to believe  that  a
           witness is not telling the truth about matters, has  exaggerated
           his story to make his case better, or is simply uncertain  about
           matters, and still to be persuaded that the centre piece of  the
           story stands".

       The Tribunal did not  decide  that  an  adjudicator  was  obliged  to
       believe a story if uncertainties, exaggerations, lack  of  memory  or
       lies went only to details.  What it did decide was that the existence
       of such difficulties is not in law a bar to an adjudicator (or,  now,
       an Immigration Judge) believing other  parts  of  what  is  said  if,
       having taken everything into account, he decides it right to do so.

55.  The  other  authority  referred  to  under,  though  not  exactly   on
    credibility is Daoud (Mohd.) [2005] EWCA Civ 755; the relevant  passage
    is this, per  Sedley LJ, writing at paragraph 11 for the court:

       To claim falsely that you have been persecuted in the past because of
       your ethnicity does not mean that you  may  not  face  risks  in  the
       future because of it.  As before, if the linkage of  allegations  had
       some binding legal force it would work  both  ways,  with  completely
       intractable results.

56. In this case, despite some suggestions to  the  contrary  by  Professor
    Osborn, there is not, and could not  be  any  arguable  case  that  the
    appellant faced persecution simply because  he  is  a  Fulani,  and  Mr
    McCarthy realistically did not argue that, either in writing, or at the
    hearing. One might also point to the 47.5%  share  of  the  final  poll
    achieved by the Fulani candidate in the 2010 elections.

57. If I believed the appellant's account of what happened to him  in  2006
    was reasonably likely to be true, then  of  course  I  should  have  to
    consider whether or not it would lead to any real  risk  on  return  to
    Guinea for him now, whatever findings the judge or I  might  have  made
    about subsequent events. However, it would be not only artificial,  but
    wrong  to  consider  any  aspect  of  the  appellant's  credibility  in
    isolation, without having his history as a whole in mind.

58. The  points  made  by  Mr  McCarthy  in  relation  to  the  appellant's
    credibility on the events of 2006 themselves are set out at  section  B
    of his skeleton argument. He notes that the appellant claimed  to  have
    taken part in demonstrations, organized by the  trade  unions,  in  the
    summer of 2006, and gave specific dates  for  those  in  which  he  was
    involved,  8  and  16  June.  Professor  Osborn  confirms   that   such
    demonstrations took place from 2005 - 07, and gives a specific date  of
    12 June 2006  for  the  one  in  which  she  describes  students  being
    involved.

59. A reference in the appellant's statement (1) to one of  the  grievances
    in the general strike of 10 January 2007 being about the release of the
    then Prime Minister from detention over allegations of embezzlement was
    said to be borne out in an extract from the UN's IRIN web-site. This is
    dated 7 April 2006, and entitled 'Sacked prime  minister  speaks  out'.
    However, curiously enough, not only  is  the  subject  of  the  article
    quoted as denying that he was even under house arrest; but his name  is
    given as Cellou Dalein Diallo, who is a Fulani,  and  curiously  enough
    was in 2010 and afterwards to become the main opponent of  the  current
    President Cond�: see 46.

60. At section C, Mr McCarthy refers to the evidence about the  appellant's
    dealings with the Gloucester Law Centre, already set  out  at  23,  and
    suggests that this, and the IOM application, provide  support  for  the
    appellant's own account of  his  reasons  for  wanting  to  leave  this
    country in early 2010. There is however no  evidence,  apart  from  his
    own, that he actually did so.





61. At D, Mr McCarthy refers to the Guinea arrival stamp on the copy  pages
    from the Thierno Mamoudou Bah passport. Then  he  deals  with  a  point
    taken by the Home Office in the refusal letter, but  already  dismissed
    by me at 37. E relates  the  appellant's  account  of  his  history  on
    arrival there; at paragraph 30,  points  (i)  and  (ii)  refer  to  the
    turbulent state of Guinea at the time, already mentioned, and (iii)  to
    the 'active word of mouth system', mentioning Professor Osborn's views,
    as set out at 48, and information passed on by the neighbourhood  chief
    (see 25). There is also a  reference  at  (iv)  to  Professor  Osborn's
    suggestion at 50, about the likely situation on the appellant's  return
    to Guinea.

62. At paragraphs 31 - 32, Mr McCarthy refers to evidence  from  the  State
    Department and 'Freedom House', and from Professor Osborn,  about  mass
    arrests, detention and ill-treatment continuing into 2012; but I do not
    see anything 'strikingly similar' to the  appellant's  account  in  the
    items he notes: such events are common to  most  countries  from  which
    asylum-seekers come.

63. Mr McCarthy did not add anything significant in his oral submissions on
    the appellant's  credibility,  except  that  he  gave  essentially  his
    present account in his original asylum interview in 2010, and has stuck
    to it ever since. The rest of his submissions deal with  the  risk  for
    the appellant on return to Guinea, if his account were accepted, and  I
    shall deal with them if I do.

64. Findings of fact       It is perhaps unnecessary to mention that it  is
    only necessary for the appellant to persuade me that a  given  fact  is
    reasonably likely to be true for me to take  it  into  account;  or  to
    point out that, while I shall give my findings on individual points  as
    I go, I have not reached any of them without considering  the  evidence
    as a whole.

65. The appellant is an intelligent and above all  resourceful  person,  as
    his history shows. I shall start this discussion  at  the  point  where
    official records of him (rather than of someone who may have been  him,
    using the Thierno Mamoudou Bah passport) begin in  this  country.  This
    was on 4 April 2009, when (see 32) using his present claimed real name,
    he told the immigration officer at his screening interview that he  had
    entered this country on 1 January that  year,  having  spent  the  time
    since his uncle arranged his release in 2007 working in the Gambia.

66. The appellant's only explanation for  this  was  that  the  interpreter
    might have mis-translated what he had said in French, the main official
    and business language of Guinea, and the one in which he had agreed  to
    be interviewed. I cannot see any reason why translation from the French
    could possibly have caused so significant a  deviation  from  what  the
    appellant now claims is his true account, and I do not accept that this
    was what happened.

67. While it is quite true, as Mr McCarthy suggested,  that  the  appellant
    has been entirely consistent (with one exception, to which I shall turn
    in the next paragraph) in the account  he  has  given  since  his  full
    asylum interview  on  16  August  2010,  that  consistency  has  to  be
    considered both in the light of his resourcefulness, and of what I find
    he had said in 2009.



68. The appellant's blaming the Home Office interpreter for what he claimed
    had been the mis-translation of what he had said in 2009 ties  in  with
    the other exception to his  general  consistency,  which  lies  in  his
    blaming his own solicitors' interpreter (see 26)  for  the  mistake  he
    says was made in recording his statement (2) on 22 October 2010.  Again
    the interpreter used French, and carefully recorded that  he  had  read
    the statement back to the appellant in that language: I do  not  accept
    that any error in translation could have caused  the  appellant  to  be
    recorded as saying that Elhadji Barry had  been  the  leader  of  their
    local group, if he had really had that r�le himself.

69. These findings against the appellant both relate to  the  part  of  his
    evidence concerned with events before his claimed return to  Guinea  in
    2010, the credibility or otherwise of which is  the  crucial  issue  of
    fact before me. Turning to the evidence about that, the  only  specific
    documentary support for the appellant's account of  his  arrival  there
    appeared at the final hearing, its provenance  vouched  for  by  a  DHL
    waybill. It was however not clear how the appellant's uncle could  have
    got a copy of the passport, but been unable to get the document  itself
    from a well-placed friend at the airport, as he claimed.

70. Leaving the provenance to one side, the passport page itself  (see  28)
    has some curious features: while there is nothing to indicate that  the
    Guinea re-entry stamp of 26 December 2006 (a) is not  genuine  (and  it
    probably is, since it fits the use of the passport in Brussels  earlier
    that month), the one of 4 March 2010 (b) is very  much  clearer.  There
    might be nothing suspicious in that  in  itself,  since  no  doubt  the
    Guinea immigration authorities get themselves a new rubber  stamp  from
    time to time; however, it  has  to  be  considered  together  with  the
    existence of the third faint, but clearly perceptible stamp (c).

71. The appellant had no explanation for stamp (c) at all,  and  disclaimed
    all knowledge of how (b) could have been applied to a photocopy, so  as
    to make it look like a genuine entry. I do not believe he is  so  na�ve
    as not to have realized that. It is quite clear from the faint  remains
    of stamp (c) that the passport page has been tampered with in some way,
    and I have no doubt that this was also done by applying stamp (b) to  a
    photocopy of the original document.

72. Going on to the only other documentary trace of the appellant's  return
    to Guinea, which is what is said to be the copy of  the  2010  summons,
    the fact that the authorities should have issued a summons, rather than
    a warrant as they were said to have done in 2007, on this occasion at a
    time when they  well  knew  the  appellant  had  already  escaped  from
    custody, itself raised a serious question as to the authenticity of the
    document. I had hoped that if a 'country expert'  more  worthy  of  the
    name than Miss Monekosso  were  found  for  the  appellant,  then  some
    further light might be shed on this.

73. While Professor Osborn certainly is such a person, as already seen  (51
    - 52), she failed either to shed any such light on that question, or to
    confront it at all. I do not accept her suggestion that there  was  any
    reason for the Guinean authorities to have regarded this appellant as a
    'person of interest' (see 48) on his claimed return to the  country  in
    2010, given the judge's unchallengeable finding that he had never  been
    arrested in 2007 (which she does not seem to have taken into  account),
    following which he had spent three years away, during  which  time  the
    turbulent events set out at 43 - 44 had taken place in Guinea.

74. Nevertheless, whether I am right or wrong on that last point, Professor
    Osborn's failure to deal at all with the obvious question  of  why  the
    Guinean  authorities  should  have  simply  left  a  summons  with  the
    appellant's uncle, when they knew he was already an  escaped  prisoner,
    leaves what is said to be the copy of that summons without any support,
    independently  of  the  appellant's  own   evidence,   as   documentary
    confirmation of his presence in Guinea in 2010.

75. While the appellant certainly explored  the  possibility  of  voluntary
    assisted return in January and February 2010 with  the  Gloucester  Law
    Centre and with GARAS, and just as certainly came back to this  country
    from Brussels that July, there is neither any documentary  confirmation
    of his actual journey to or back from Guinea; nor any from the  Belgian
    authorities as to where he had arrived in Brussels from. In the absence
    of any exit controls in this country for some  years  before  that,  it
    would not have been hard for someone as resourceful as  this  appellant
    to find a means of presenting himself  at  the  point  of  entry  to  a
    neighbouring European country without leaving any trace of the means.

76. Nor do I consider that it would have been past this  appellant  to  use
    the dealings he had had with the law centre and with GARAS, once he had
    been advised his 2009 claim was unlikely to succeed,  by  concocting  a
    false account of his return to Guinea in 2010, supported by a not  only
    true, but verifiable history of those dealings, and of  his  return  to
    this country from Brussels.

77. Given those findings, and the ones I have already reached  against  the
    appellant, both on points which did (69 - 74), and did not  (65  -  68)
    concern the appellant's claimed return to Guinea in March  2010,  I  am
    not prepared to accept that it ever took place. In my view he has shown
    himself a thoroughly unscrupulous claimant, not only in  inventing  it,
    but in concocting evidence to support it, and  I  am  not  prepared  to
    accept either that he ever took part in any demonstrations in Guinea in
    2006, as to which the judge made no express finding;  nor,  as  I  have
    already (11 - 12) made clear, is there any  reason  to  go  behind  her
    negative findings on claimed events there in 2007.

78. That leaves the appellant without any  relevant  political  history  in
    Guinea at all, which in my view marks the end of his claim. Even  if  I
    were wrong about the 2006 events, however, he does not  claim  to  have
    been arrested by the Guinean authorities at any time before the Thierno
    Mamoudou Bah passport was used to get a visa for him in  Brussels  that
    December; and, despite what he says about being identified by his local
    chief, he seems to have gone on helping his uncle in the  family  shop,
    so I do not accept that this happened either.


79. The result is, that  even  if  the  appellant  did  take  part  in  any
    demonstrations  back  in  2006,  I  do  not  accept  that  the  Guinean
    authorities would have anything on record against him on return now  in
    2013. I do accept that he is a Fulani; but, as made clear at  56,  that
    could not by itself be the basis of any successful claim of  Convention
    persecution or ill-treatment.
