Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
An anonymity direction was made by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.   Although
the appeal no longer involves a protection claim, we continue the  anonymity
direction because the case involves  minor  children.  Unless  and  until  a
tribunal or court directs otherwise, the Appellant is granted anonymity.  No
report of these proceedings shall directly or  indirectly  identify  him  or
any member of his family. This direction applies both to the  Appellant  and
to the Respondent.

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss S Iqbal, Counsel instructed by Chris Raja
solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Background

      1. The Appellant appeals against a  decision  of  First-Tier  Tribunal
         Judge C H Bennett promulgated  on  24  May  2017  ("the  Decision")
         dismissing the Appellant's appeal against the Secretary of  State's
         decision dated 1 July 2016 refusing his protection and human rights
         claims which decision was made  in  the  context  of  an  automatic
         deportation order.

      2. The Appellant is a national of Colombia.  He came to the UK in 1999
         and claimed asylum which claim was refused.  He married his wife on
         18 December 2004.  His wife is originally from Colombia  but  is  a
         recognised refugee  from  that  country.   She  is  now  a  British
         citizen. The Appellant returned to Colombia on 16 November 2005 and
         returned with a visa to join his wife.  Although initially  refused
         indefinite leave to remain, he was granted ILR on  29  March  2008.
         He was however  refused  citizenship  because  he  had  a  criminal
         conviction.

      3. The couple have three children, [DC] who was born  in  April  2004,
         [JC] who was born in February 2007 and [CC] who was born in January
         2010.  All the children are British citizens.

      4. The Appellant's first criminal conviction was on 16 April 2007 when
         he  was  convicted  of  driving  with  excess  alcohol,  fined  and
         disqualified from driving for eighteen months.  A  further  driving
         offence followed in September 2009.  The index offence in this case
         is one of possessing Class A  drugs  (cocaine)  with  intention  to
         supply for which he received a sentence of five years' imprisonment
         on 15 October 2010.

      5. The Appellant was served with a notice of liability to  deportation
         on 22 November 2010.  He responded  on  3  December  2010  with  an
         asylum and Article 8 claim.  That  was  followed  up  with  further
         submissions in support of a protection and human  rights  claim  in
         July 2012.  On 6 April  2013,  the  Appellant's  criminal  sentence
         ended.  His asylum screening interview  took  place  on  20  August
         2013.  In response to a further notice of liability to deportation,
         the Appellant claimed to have been  trafficked  but  withdrew  that
         claim on 25 March 2014.  On 8 January 2015 and 13 April  2015,  the
         Appellant made further submissions  about  why  he  should  not  be
         deported following which, on 28 September 2015, he was served  with
         an  automatic  deportation  order.   He  responded  making  further
         submissions about why he should not be deported on 30 October 2015.
          A further asylum interview took place on 4 March 2016  leading  to
         the Respondent's decision under appeal.

      6. The appeal against the Decision is on human  rights  grounds  only;
         there is no appeal against  the  Judge's  decision  dismissing  the
         Appellant's protection claim.

      7. Judge Bennett accepted that  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  for  the
         Appellant's wife and children to return to Colombia with him  ([61]
         and [62] of the Decision).  However, he concluded that it would not
         be unduly harsh for them to remain in the UK without  him  ([78(b)]
         of the Decision).

      8. In relation to the private  life  exception  provided  for  by  the
         Immigration  Rules  ("the  Rules")  and   Section   117C   of   the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("Section 117C"),  the
         Judge did not accept that the Appellant could meet those provisions
         because he had not lived in the UK lawfully for over half his life,
         he was not socially and culturally integrated and  there  were  not
         very  significant  obstacles  to  the  Appellant's  integration  in
         Colombia ([65] to [67] of the Decision).

      9.  Crucially,  since  the  Appellant  was  sentenced  to  a  term  of
         imprisonment of five years, the Appellant could not succeed on  the
         basis that he meets the exceptions even if  those  were  satisfied.
         He would need to show that there are very compelling  circumstances
         over and above the exceptions.  Judge  Bennett  was  not  satisfied
         that  such  circumstances  exist  in  this  case  ([78(a)]  of  the
         Decision).

     10. Taking his conclusions  together,  the  Judge  concluded  that  the
         Appellant's human rights claim should fail.

     11. The Appellant raises five grounds of challenge to the Decision.  We
         deal with those in more detail below.   Permission  to  appeal  was
         refused by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Grant-Hutchison  on  20  June
         2017 and by Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Craig  on  20  September  2017.
         Thereafter, the Appellant applied to the Administrative  Court  for
         judicial review of Judge Craig's refusal of permission  to  appeal.
         Mr Justice Nicklin was  persuaded  to  grant  permission  for  that
         judicial review on 30 November 2017 in the following terms  so  far
         as relevant:

             "...

             [3] The FTTJ made a large number of positive factual  findings
             (set out in �� 12-24  Statement  of  Grounds)  including:  the
             Appellant no longer constituted a danger to the  community  of
             the UK and the presumption that he did under s7(2)  [sic]  had
             been rebutted; there was a genuine and subsisting relationship
             between the Appellant and his wife and children: 7 � , 10  and
             13 (all born in the UK and British Citizens); the  Appellant's
             wife had been granted asylum in the UK from Colombia  and  the
             FTTJ was satisfied that she was afraid to  return  there  (the
             children  had  never  been  to  Colombia  and  did  not  speak
             Spanish); the wife had lived in the UK for 15 years and made a
             life for herself and the children were settled in  schools  in
             the UK; it would be 'unduly harsh' to expect  the  Appellant's
             wife to return to Colombia and live there;  and  it  would  be
             'unduly harsh' to expect the children to  settle  in  Colombia
             without their mother and, if  they  did,  their  wider  family
             relationships in the UK would be 'substantially disrupted'.

             [4] Nevertheless,  despite  those  findings,  the  FTTJ  found
             ([78]) that he was not satisfied (1) that "it would be  unduly
             harsh for all or any of [the Appellant's wife and children] to
             remain in the UK without the  Appellant",  and  (2)  that  the
             Appellant's  removal   would   involve   a   "disproportionate
             interference with his right to private and family life  and/or
             the corresponding rights of all or  any  of  [the  Appellant's
             wife and children]".

             [5] It  appears  to  me  arguable  the  findings  in  (4)  are
             irrational in light  of  the  findings  in  (3)  above  (�  32
             Statement of Facts and Grounds) or that they could  only  have
             been produced by an error in application of the  relevant  law
             or (as argued in � 40 Statement of Grounds) the failure of the
             FTTJ to conduct a [words  missing  from  copy  of  order]  the
             Immigration Rules.

             [6] The FTTJ correctly identified that the  interests  of  the
             children were a (not the) primary consideration [56], but  his
             assessment  of  their  interests  was  arguably  too  narrowly
             restricted.  It is arguable that, stepping back, the effect of
             deporting the Appellant would be,  effectively,  to  terminate
             these three children's relationship  with  their  father;  the
             FTTJ found that the family could not practically go  with  him
             to Colombia.  That represents a very serious interference with
             the  children's  Article  8  rights,  which  would  require  a
             countervailing commensurate justification..."

     12. Permission to appeal to  the  Tribunal  was  granted  by  the  Vice
         President of the Tribunal on 5 November  2018  based  on  the  High
         Court's grant of permission.  The matter comes before us to  decide
         whether the Decision contains a material error of law.

     13. Under cover of a letter dated  21  January  2019,  the  Appellant's
         solicitors filed additional evidence which was not before the First-
         tier Tribunal.  That was not supported by an application under Rule
         15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 as  it
         should have been.  We indicated that, if the  Appellant  wished  to
         have that evidence considered in the event that we  set  aside  the
         Decision, his solicitors should make the  appropriate  application.
         An application was made under cover of a letter  dated  30  January
         2019, but Miss Iqbal accepted that this is not evidence to which we
         should have regard at the error of law stage as it was  not  before
         Judge Bennett.

    Discussion and Conclusions

     14. We begin by observing that the Decision is  extremely  lengthy  and
         detailed.  It runs to seventy-three pages  of  close  typeface  and
         eighty-four paragraphs.  Of course, that does not mean that it does
         not contain an error of law if the  Judge  has  indeed  misdirected
         himself or reached findings which were  not  open  to  him  on  the
         evidence but is an indication of the attention which the Judge gave
         to the case.

     15. We were addressed by Miss Iqbal on all the grounds  raised  in  the
         initial grounds of appeal.  Judge Nicklin's  Order  indicates  that
         the grounds which found favour with him are the Appellant's  ground
         five coupled with the assertion in  ground  one  that  the  Judge's
         conclusion is perverse in light of his positive findings on certain
         factors. As that is the basis of the grant and the  main  focus  of
         the grounds before us, we have concentrated most of  our  attention
         on that ground.  Before we turn to deal with that ground,  however,
         we deal with the other grounds  raised  as  our  conclusions  about
         those grounds may impact on the more general issue.

    Ground Two

     16. The Appellant asserts that the Judge erred in rejecting the  expert
         evidence of Mr Peter Horrocks,  a  social  worker  who  provided  a
         report dealing with the effect of deportation of the  Appellant  on
         his children.  The complaint  raised  in  ground  two  concerns  Mr
         Horrocks' opinion about the separation anxiety disorder which  [DC]
         suffered when the Appellant was in prison  and  the  likelihood  of
         reoccurrence if the Appellant is deported.

     17. The Judge deals with Mr Horrocks' report at [11(c)] and [11(d)]  of
         the Decision before reaching his findings about that report and the
         weight to be attributed to it at [69] of the Decision.

     18. We deal first with Miss Iqbal's submission that the Judge  was  not
         entitled to give that  report  no  weight  based  on  Mr  Horrocks'
         qualifications.  Although, as Miss Iqbal rightly pointed  out,  the
         Judge did not have Mr Horrocks' CV which was said to be annexed  to
         the report but was not, and the Judge could  have  asked  for  that
         during or after the hearing, that can make no difference.  We  were
         shown the CV which confirms the point made by the Judge at  [69(a)]
         that Mr Horrocks does  not  have  any  medical  qualifications  and
         therefore does not have the requisite expertise to make a  reliable
         prediction  of  the  likely   consequences   of   the   Appellant's
         deportation on the  mental  health  of  the  Appellant's  wife  and
         children.  The Judge was entitled to  take  account  of  the  other
         family support on which the Appellant's wife  could  call  and  the
         difference in the age of [DC] between the time his  father  was  in
         prison and the present.  Neither of those factors was considered by
         Mr Horrocks ([69(c)] and [69(d)]).

     19. Miss Iqbal also said that the Judge failed to  consider  the  other
         medical  evidence  besides  Mr  Horrocks'   report.     The   Judge
         considered that evidence at [11(e)] of the  Decision  and  took  it
         into account when  considering  Mr  Horrocks'  report  at  [69(e)].
         Whilst, as Miss Iqbal pointed out,  Mr  Horrocks'  assumptions  are
         based on what happened in the past taken with  the  fact  that  the
         Appellant  would  be  parted  permanently  from  his  children   by
         deportation rather than just temporarily as before and this is  not
         mentioned expressly by the Judge, the fact remains,  as  the  Judge
         points out at [69] of the Decision, that, if the  Appellant  wanted
         to make out that case, he needed to provide evidence from an expert
         with suitable medical qualifications and not from a  social  worker
         without that experience.

     20. There is no error in the  Judge's  consideration  of  Mr  Horrocks'
         report.







    Ground Three

     21. The focus of this ground is the Judge's conclusions concerning  the
         Respondent's delay, said to be of over four years in  dealing  with
         the Appellant's claims before deciding to deport him.  It  is  said
         that, during that time the Appellant was permitted to  develop  his
         family and private life and that  the  Judge  has  failed  to  give
         weight to this factor when balancing the public interest.

     22. We begin by agreeing with Mr Tufan's submission that there  is  not
         in fact a delay of four years in this case.  We  have  referred  to
         the chronology of the Appellant's  case  at  [5]  above.   As  that
         chronology shows, the Appellant was first notified of his liability
         to deportation in 2010 even before he had  completed  his  criminal
         sentence.   At  that  stage,  there  is  no  requirement  for   the
         Respondent to take  action  given  that  the  Appellant  cannot  be
         deported at  that  stage  and  it  may  not  be  sensible  for  the
         Respondent to carry out consideration of deportation whilst that is
         the position (see [20] of the judgment of Elisabeth Laing  QC  when
         sitting as a Deputy Judge in BA v SSHD [2011] EWHC  2748  (Admin)).



     23. Following release from prison in April 2013, a screening  interview
         took place and the Appellant was given further opportunity  to  say
         why he should not be deported, leading to  a  claim  to  have  been
         trafficked, which was  later  withdrawn  in  March  2014.   Further
         submissions were made in early 2015 to which the Respondent reacted
         in September 2015 by making the automatic deportation decision  and
         again  inviting  submissions  why  the  Appellant  should  not   be
         deported.   That was responded  to  on  30  October  2015  and  the
         Respondent's decision under appeal followed less  than  six  months
         later following a further asylum interview.   There was  little  or
         no period of inaction between April 2013  when  the  Appellant  was
         released from  detention  and  March  2016  when  the  Respondent's
         decision was taken.

     24. Miss Iqbal submitted that the Judge had failed to take  account  of
         the Respondent's policy  as  contained  in  his  guidance  entitled
         "Criminality: Article 8 ECHR cases" dated 22  February  2017.   She
         drew our attention in particular to what is  said  in  relation  to
         delay as follows:

             "A foreign criminal may claim that  where  there  has  been  a
             delay in decision-making (for example between the end  of  the
             custodial sentence and the decision to deport, or the date  of
             any representations and the  date  of  decision),  the  public
             interest in their deportation  is  reduced  or  their  private
             and/or family life has strengthened in the intervening period,
             such that deportation would be disproportionate.  Delay should
             always be considered and explained in the assessment  of  very
             compelling circumstances even if the foreign criminal has  not
             relied on it  at  this  stage.   Delay  caused  by  a  foreign
             criminal or those acting on their  behalf  will  be  given  no
             weight in the  foreign  criminal's  favour  in  an  Article  8
             assessment. Delay caused by the Home Office will be given less
             weight if the foreign criminal was, at the time of the  delay,
             in the UK unlawfully. The consequence  of  Home  Office  delay
             when the foreign criminal was in the UK lawfully is likely  to
             depend on the reasons for and consequences of,  the  delay  on
             the foreign criminal's  family  and  private  life  (see,  for
             example, EB  (Kosovo)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
             Department [2008] UKHL 41)."

         We note that this is guidance intended for Home Office  caseworkers
         and there was no obligation on the Tribunal to  refer  to  it.   It
         does no more than state the legal position emerging from  case  law
         in any event.

     25. Even if the Appellant is entitled to rely on there being any period
         of delay, the Judge considered that submission in depth at [70]  to
         [73]  of  the  Decision.     He  correctly  directed   himself   in
         accordance with the relevant case  law  and  considered  what  were
         undoubtedly the relevant issues.  At [72] and [73] of the Decision,
         the Judge  concluded  that  the  Appellant  had  not  developed  or
         established any deeper roots in the  period  of  delay  than  those
         developed or established earlier.  He pointed out that the evidence
         did not show that the Appellant and his family had any  expectation
         that the Appellant might be permitted to remain notwithstanding his
         conviction.  Nor did the evidence show that the Appellant  and  his
         family had suffered any prejudice or disadvantage by reason of  the
         delay.

     26. In those  circumstances,  the  Judge  was  entitled  to  reach  the
         conclusions he did as summarised at [73(f)] of the Decision  as  to
         the effects of the delay which were positive rather  than  negative
         for the Appellant and his family.

     27. There is no merit in ground three.

    Ground Four

     28. Ground four is a complaint that the Judge gave too little weight to
         the lack of offending by  the  Appellant  since  his  release  from
         custody.  That is a matter which goes to the overall  balancing  of
         the factors for and against the Appellant and it is therefore  more
         convenient to deal with this ground with ground one which  involves
         a general attack on the Judge's balancing of the Article 8 factors.



    Ground Five

     29. The fifth ground is that the Judge failed  to  consider  Article  8
         ECHR outside the Rules.   We  accept  that  the  Supreme  Court  in
         Hesham Ali v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60 rejected the proposition that  the
         Rules are a "complete code" and concluded that MF (Nigeria) v  SSHD
         [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 was incorrectly decided in that  regard.   The
         Tribunal is nonetheless, as the Supreme Court  accepted,  bound  to
         give weight to the scheme laid down in the  Rules.   Moreover,  the
         Tribunal is itself now bound to have regard also  to  Section  117C
         which sets out the way in which the public interest question is  to
         be considered in deportation cases.

     30. In any event, the Judge's evaluation of the Article  8  factors  in
         this appeal did go beyond simply reaching findings on the Rules and
         applying Section 117C.  He was of course required by  Section  117C
         to consider not  (or  not  only)  whether  the  Appellant  met  the
         exceptions  but   also   whether   there   were   very   compelling
         circumstances over and above the exceptions.  That he  did  in  the
         manner directed by the Supreme Court in Hesham Ali at [79]  of  the
         Decision,  by  setting  out  fully  the  adverse  impacts  for  the
         Appellant and more  importantly  his  family  and  balancing  those
         against the public interest.

     31. There is no merit in ground five in terms of the Judge's  approach.
         However, as we observe above, this is  one  of  the  grounds  which
         appears to have found some  favour  with  Mr  Justice  Nicklin  and
         therefore we also consider whether the Judge can be  said  to  have
         erred by failing properly to conduct the assessment when looking at
         the more general ground that the Decision is irrational.

    Ground One

     32. We therefore turn finally to the main point which found favour with
         Mr Justice Nicklin.  He concluded that Judge Bennett's  conclusions
         may be irrational taking into account  the  findings  made  in  the
         Appellant's favour and, in particular, the adverse  effect  on  the
         Appellant's children.

     33. In reaching our conclusions on this ground, we have regard to  what
         is said by Judge Bennett about the evidence both as to  the  impact
         of  deportation  on  the  Appellant's  family  and  the   risk   of
         reoffending at [9] to [11] of the Decision.   We also  have  regard
         to the Judge's findings at [23] of the Decision about the  risk  of
         reoffending which are made in the context of whether the  Appellant
         continues to represent a danger to the community  in  consideration
         of section 72 of the 2002 Act.

     34. Miss Iqbal accepted in her submissions to us that the Judge applied
         the correct legal test when addressing Article 8  ECHR.    She  was
         right to do so.   The Judge sets out Section 117C and  the  correct
         Rules at [49] and [50] of the  Decision.    At  [51],  he  properly
         directs himself to the level of interference which the Appellant is
         required to show in order to succeed  in  light  of  his  sentence.
         The Judge also refers to case law which is relevant to the test  to
         be applied.

     35. The Appellant obviously  does  not  take  issue  with  the  Judge's
         finding that it would be unduly harsh for his wife and children  to
         return with him to Colombia.  Neither does he object to the Judge's
         conclusions as regards his own private life.

     36. The passage with which the Appellant takes issue begins at [68]  of
         the  Decision  where  the  Judge  considers  the  effect   on   the
         Appellant's wife and children if they remain in the  UK  whilst  he
         returns to Colombia.  The factors taken into account in this regard
         are that the Appellant's wife has family members in the UK who  can
         assist her with care of the children, that the Appellant's wife did
         not say that she was unable to cope whilst  the  Appellant  was  in
         prison and that the evidence does not show that the  activities  in
         which the children engage (so far as they do),  cannot  be  catered
         for with such assistance as is  available  either  from  the  wider
         family or other parents.

     37. We have already referred to Judge Bennett's findings in relation to
         Mr Horrocks' evidence.  In light of his findings about that  report
         and the other medical evidence, the Judge did not consider that the
         deportation of the Appellant would have the serious effects on [DC]
         that Mr Horrocks predicted.

     38. We have also dealt above with the Judge's conclusions about  delay.
         If and insofar as there was delay by the  Respondent,  the  Judge's
         conclusion that this was not a relevant factor when considering the
         public interest was open to him on the evidence ([73]).

     39. The Judge accepted and took into account that the Appellant has not
         reoffended since his release.  As a result of the matters  set  out
         at [75] of the Decision, the Judge  was  entitled  to  give  little
         weight to that factor.  As he observed, factors such as  deterrence
         remain relevant when assessing Article  8  ECHR.   As  Lord  Wilson
         stated at [70] of the judgment in Hesham  Ali,  whilst  perhaps  no
         longer to be referred to  as  societal  revulsion,  public  concern
         about the  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  another  factor
         deserving of weight.   The Supreme Court made clear at [50] of  the
         judgment  in  Hesham  Ali  that  the  Tribunal  is  bound  to  give
         appropriate weight to Parliament's and  the  Respondent's  view  of
         what the public interest requires when assessing Article 8.

     40. As Mr Justice Nicklin noted when granting permission, Judge Bennett
         has properly directed himself when approaching the  best  interests
         of the children ([56]).  Judge Bennett in his conclusions  at  [76]
         accepted that the best interests of  the  children  are  served  by
         having the Appellant in the UK with them.  That conclusion is based
         on his earlier findings as to the impact on  those  children  ([68]
         and [69] of the Decision).  However, he  was  right  to  go  on  to
         observe that the best interests  of  the  children  in  deportation
         cases are unlikely to be a sufficiently compelling circumstance  to
         outweigh what is a strong public interest.

     41. The Judge's conclusions in relation to the Article 8 assessment are
         thereafter summarised at [78] of the Decision.  The Judge  was  not
         satisfied that there are very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
         above the exceptions which can  be  said  to  outweigh  the  public
         interest, did not accept that it would  be  unduly  harsh  for  the
         Appellant's family to remain in the UK without  him  and  concluded
         that the interference with the  Appellant's  private  life  is  not
         disproportionate.

     42. The Judge's conclusions are expanded  upon  in  what  follows.   He
         takes into account his earlier findings that the family  will  cope
         without the Appellant with assistance from the wider  family,  that
         the Appellant's wife and children will be "saddened  and  seriously
         upset" by the Appellant's deportation.  However,  he  concludes  on
         the evidence that their mental and  physical  health  will  not  be
         adversely impacted or that, if there are any adverse  consequences,
         those will not be severe or could be treated within a short time.

     43. The Judge accepts that deportation of the Appellant will mean  that
         he is separated from his family but  points  out  that  this  is  a
         consequence of the scheme which has been  approved  by  Parliament.
         The Judge considers the possible impacts on the family left  behind
         but again directs himself that more than  normal  consequences  are
         required to outweigh the public interest.  For the reasons which he
         gives at [79(g) and (h)], the  Judge  concludes  that  the  adverse
         impact on the Appellant's wife  and  children  does  not  meet  the
         threshold of being  unduly  harsh  and  does  not  amount  to  very
         compelling circumstances over and above that exception.

     44. The Judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court's  judgment
         in KO (Nigeria) v SSHD [2018] UKSC 53 about the meaning of  "unduly
         harsh" as being an elevated standard of something which is  already
         "severe,  or  bleak".   However,  his  analysis  of   the   adverse
         consequences of deportation for the Appellant's wife and family and
         conclusion that these do not  meet  the  necessary  thresholds  are
         consistent with the application of that high standard. In  response
         to the paragraph of the Appellant's grounds which suggests that the
         Judge should have taken account of the fact that the  sentence  was
         at the lower range of an over four years sentence we note that  the
         Judge was plainly aware of the length of the sentence and  that  he
         applied the correct test, namely that in section 117C  (6).  We  do
         not consider that he erred in this respect and we find  nothing  in
         the analysis contained in KO (Nigeria) to suggest that he did.

     45. The Judge sets out at [79(i) to  (l)]  his  conclusions  about  the
         weight to be given to the public interest and other  factors  which
         might militate in the Appellant's favour.   In so doing,  he  takes
         account of the  Appellant's  lack  of  offending  since  the  index
         offence, the low risk of reoffending and  his  co-operation  during
         the period of his licence.   However, the Judge also had regard  to
         the wider effects of the Appellant's offending when considering the
         public interest. Those impacts are relevant as we have already made
         clear.

     46. The Supreme Court at [50] of the judgment in Hesham  Ali  advocated
         what the approach should be for a Tribunal tasked with carrying out
         an assessment of the proportionality balance  in  Article  8  ECHR.
         That is the exercise which the Judge carried out in  this  case  at
         [79] of the Decision.   We discern no error in  his  approach  and,
         for the reasons which we have already given, we can find  no  error
         either in the Judge's evaluation of the evidence or his findings on
         that evidence. The findings and conclusions are ones which are open
         to the Judge on the evidence.  Whilst there are some findings which
         are positive and are to be given some  weight  in  the  Appellant's
         favour (such as lack of reoffending and  low  risk  of  offending),
         those are considered and balanced in the equation.  The conclusions
         cannot be said to be irrational.

     47. It follows that we are satisfied that the Decision does not contain
         an error of law.  Accordingly, we uphold the Decision.

    DECISION

    We are satisfied that the Decision does not contain a material error of
    law. We uphold the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  C  H  Bennett
    promulgated on 24 May 2017 with the consequence  that  the  Appellant's
    appeal stands dismissed
