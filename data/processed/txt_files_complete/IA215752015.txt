                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of  State  (appellant)  against  the
    decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  C  Greasley  who,  in  a
    decision promulgated on 17 October  2016,  allowed  the  appeal  of  Mr
    Hassan Pourmami Hamamlou (respondent), an Iranian national, against the
    appellant's refusal to grant him leave to remain in the United  Kingdom
    based on his relationship with his wife.

Immigration background

2.   The respondent entered the United  Kingdom  on  30  October  2009  with
    entry clearance as a Tier 4 (General) Student. On 30 April 2010 he made
    an asylum claim.  This asylum claim was refused and an  appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissed on 9 June 2010. An appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal  was  dismissed  and  the  respondent  became  appeal   rights
    exhausted on 8 August 2011. On 23 November 2011 the respondent  made  a
    human rights claim seeking leave to remain in the United Kingdom  based
    on his family and private life. This was based on his relationship with
    [SM].  She is a British citizen.  She was born in  the  United  Kingdom
    and, at the date of the First-tier Tribunal's decision,  was  35  years
    old.  She was employed at that time with Sea Life earning an income  in
    excess of ï¿½42,000.  She and the  respondent  married  on  22  September
    2011.  It is relevant to note at this stage that she  is  a  practising
    Christian.

The respondent's decision

3.   In her decision the appellant accepted that  the  respondent  and  [SM]
    were in a genuine and subsisting relationship. The respondent  did  not
    consider that there were 'insurmountable obstacles' (as required  under
    EX.1 of Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules in respect of the '10 year
    route' to settlement as a spouse) to the couple continuing their family
    life outside of the  United  Kingdom.  The  appellant  noted  that  the
    respondent arrived in the United Kingdom aged 31 years old, that he had
    spent the vast majority of his life in Iran and would be familiar  with
    that country, language, its culture and customs.  It was noted that his
    mother and sister also continued to live in Iran.

4.   The appellant acknowledged that the respondent's partner suffered  from
    obsessive compulsive disorder for which she received regular medication
    and psychological support. The appellant considered background evidence
    relating to the availability of medical treatment in Iran and commented
    that the country had a highly sophisticated and comprehensive system of
    medical  treatment.   The  appellant  then  went  on  to  consider  the
    respondent's private life rights, primarily under paragraph 276ADE, and
    concluded that he  did  not  meet  any  of  the  requirements  of  this
    paragraph.  The  appellant  then  considered  whether  there  were  any
    'exceptional circumstances' sufficient to warrant a grant of  leave  to
    remain outside the immigration rules in accordance with article  8.  In
    this regard the appellant  noted  that  the  relationship  between  the
    respondent and [SM] commenced when he did not have leave to  remain  in
    the  United  Kingdom  and  in  the  knowledge  that  his  position  was
    precarious.  It  was  concluded  that   there   were   no   exceptional
    circumstances. The respondent appealed the appellant's decision and the
    hearing occurred on 7 October 2016.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

5.   In  his  decision  the  judge  set  out  the  immigration  history  and
    summarised the basis for the appellant's refusal of the application. At
    [18] of the determination the judge noted,  as  a  preliminary  matter,
    that the Presenting Officer was seeking  an  adjournment  in  order  to
    consider an expert report, dated 30 August 2016, that had been provided
    on behalf of the  respondent  from  Dr  Kakhki,  a  recognised  Iranian
    expert. The essential findings of this expert report,  which  had  been
    provided to the appellant in accordance with directions, indicated that
    the respondent and his wife would be unable to live as husband and wife
    in Iran as this could only be achieved if [SM] converted to Islam.  The
    Presenting Officer indicated that she only had an opportunity  to  read
    the expert report on the evening prior to the appeal hearing.  She  had
    attempted to take instructions in respect of the report  but  had  been
    unable to get in contact with anyone. The  judge  gave  her  a  further
    opportunity to seek instructions. On her return  a  formal  application
    was made to adjourn the proceedings. It  was  claimed  there  had  been
    insufficient time to consider and respond to the  report  and,  in  the
    interests  of  justice,  the  appellant  should   have   a   reasonable
    opportunity to challenge the expert evidence.  This was opposed by  the
    respondent's Counsel, Mr O'Callaghan who represents the  respondent  at
    the error of law hearing.   Having  considered  the  matter  the  judge
    concluded (at [21]) that it was not appropriate to adjourn. In  support
    of his conclusion the judge  referred  to  the  overriding  obligation,
    contained  within  the   Tribunal   Procedure   (First-tier   Tribunal)
    (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules  2014,  to  ensure  a  just  and
    timely disposal of appeals. The judge additionally considered the Upper
    Tribunal decision in Nwaigwe (adjournment: fairness) [2014] UKUT  00418
    (IAC).  The appellant had had over two weeks in which to  consider  the
    expert  report.  There  has  been  sufficient  opportunity  to  provide
    rebuttal evidence. The judge noted that the appeal had previously  been
    adjourned on the basis of a failure by the  appellant  to  provide  the
    bundle. The adjournment was refused.

6.   The judge went on to record the evidence given by  the  respondent  and
    his wife.  The judge noted that they had not registered their  marriage
    with the Iranian Embassy. Her employment circumstances were  summarised
    as was her relationship with her parents and her general  circumstances
    in the United Kingdom.  The  couple  had  only  been  separated  for  a
    maximum period of seven days during the previous five years. The  judge
    heard evidence from the respondent's wife  that  she  was  a  committed
    Christian and completely westernised.

7.   The judge then gave detailed consideration to  the  expert  report.  Dr
    Kakhki was an attorney within the Iranian jurisdiction having completed
    a Bachelor of Judicial Law at the University of Tehran in 1990 followed
    by a Masters in International Law at Shiraz University in 1997. He  had
    additionally completed a PhD  in  International  Politics  and  Law  at
    Durham University in 2008, and had acted as  an  Iranian  expert  on  a
    range of topics since 2003. The judge summarised the  findings  of  the
    expert at [36] to [40] of his decision.

8.   Between [54] and [60]  the  judge  considered  whether  the  respondent
    fulfilled the requirements of the relevant Immigration Rules. The judge
    accepted that the respondent and [SM]  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship. The judge found, as an unchallenged fact, that [SM] was a
    practising Christian.  The judge attached weight to the conclusions  of
    the expert report. The judge accepted that in order for  [SM]  to  live
    with the respondent in Iran she would need to  renounce  her  Christian
    faith. The judge accepted that this was something she was not  prepared
    to do.

9.   At [57] and [58]  the  judge  gave  reasons  for  his  conclusion  that
    'insurmountable obstacles' existed preventing  family  life  with  [SM]
    continuing in Iran.  His primarily reason was that [SM] would be unable
    to live with  her  husband  in  Iran  as  the  marriage  would  not  be
    considered lawful by  the  Iranian  authorities.  This  conclusion  was
    heavily  based  on  the  content  of  the  expert  report.  The   judge
    additionally supported his findings by reference to [SM]'s inability to
    speak Farsi and the extent of her personal circumstances in the UK.  At
    [60] the judge concluded that there were  insurmountable  obstacles  by
    reference  to  EX.2  of  Appendix  FM  (which  defines   insurmountable
    obstacles which would be faced by the applicant  or  their  partner  in
    continuing their family life together outside the UK  and  which  could
    not be overcome or would entail very serious hardship for the applicant
    or their partner).

10.  The judge thereafter went on to consider, in the  alternative,  whether
    the appeal should be allowed outside of the Immigration  Rules  and  in
    accordance with article 8 principles. The judge once  again  summarised
    his findings and made reference to Section  117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Drawing his findings and the  relevant
    principles  together   the   judge   concluded   that   it   would   be
    disproportionate to expect the family to relocate to  Iran.  The  judge
    allowed the appeal on the basis  that  the  appellant's  removal  would
    constitute a disproportionate breach of article 8,  as  expressed  both
    within  the  immigration  rules   and,   exceptionally,   outside   the
    immigration rules.

The grounds of appeal

11.  The appellant's grounds take issue with the judge's  refusal  to  grant
    an adjournment.  The grounds contend  that  the  failure  to  grant  an
    adjournment constituted a procedural impropriety that led to unfairness
    to the  appellant.   This  was  because  the  appellant  did  not  have
    sufficient time to consider what were said to be complex issues  raised
    at the hearing on the claimed inability of  the  couple  to  return  to
    Iran.  I pause to note that the evidence relied  on  by  the  judge  to
    support his conclusions was not raised at the hearing; it  was  brought
    to the appellant's attention at least two weeks prior to  the  hearing.
    The grounds contend that the opinions or assertions made by  Dr  Kakhki
    were rejected by the  Upper  Tribunal  in  another  case,  SSH  and  HR
    (illegal exit: failed asylum seeker)  Iran  CG  [2016]  UKUT  308.  The
    appellant asserts that the expert did not rely on objective evidence to
    support his conclusion that [SM] would have to renounce  her  Christian
    faith. There was said  to  be  no  evidence  outside  of  the  expert's
    assertion that the Iranian Embassy in  the  United  Kingdom  would  not
    accept the  marriage  as  being  valid  and  that  the  judge  was  not
    consequently entitled to find that there were insurmountable obstacles.
    I observe in passing that paragraph 10 of the  grounds  maintains  that
    judge found insurmountable obstacles to exist based on  [SM]'s  medical
    condition her employment and her lack  of  proficiency  in  Farsi.  The
    judge's finding that the relationship would not be  recognised  by  the
    Iranian authorities was conspicuous by its absence.

12.  The  grounds  additionally  take  issue  with  the  judge's  assessment
    outside of the Immigration Rules.  It  was  contended  that  there  was
    nothing preventing [SM] from accompanying her husband to Iran whilst he
    makes an application for leave to enter the United Kingdom.

The error of law hearing and discussion

13.  The appellant has been ably represented by Mr Bramble today who  relied
    on the grounds and made no further submissions.  It was  not  necessary
    for me to hear from Mr O'Callaghan.  I am satisfied that the  appellant
    received the expert report some  two  weeks  prior  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing. It was the responsibility of the appellant on receipt
    of the expert report to  have  considered  its  contents  and  to  have
    determined in a timely manner whether there was a need to  counter  the
    assertions made  in  the  expert  report,  either  by  producing  other
    evidence or instructing her own expert. Instead  the  expert  was  only
    considered on the evening prior to the hearing. The judge  demonstrably
    took account of all relevant circumstances in  determining  whether  it
    was appropriate to grant  the  adjournment.  The  judge  made  specific
    reference to the overriding principle in the  2014  Immigration  Rules.
    The judge gave a coherent and  rational  explanation  for  refusing  to
    grant the adjournment.  In so doing the judge  considered  the  reasons
    given by the appellant for seeking an adjournment and  the  explanation
    for the  delay  is  making  the  application.  The  judge  made  proper
    reference to the decision in Nwaigwe. The judge was  entitled  to  find
    that  the  respondent  had  possession  of  the  expert  report  for  a
    sufficient period to have enabled her to consider both the  content  of
    the report and her position in relation to  the  expert's  conclusions.
    The respondent did identify, either in her grounds or at the  error  of
    law hearing, any apparent error or inconsistency within the report, nor
    was there any identification of the assertions or  conclusions  reached
    by the expert with which the respondent disagreed.

14.  Contrary to the appellant's assertion  the  expert  did  in  provide  a
    coherent,  detailed  and  properly   referenced   assessment   of   the
    requirements [SM] had to satisfy in order to enter Iran as a spouse and
    in order for their marriage to be recognised  (see  section  4  of  the
    expert report). The expert quoted extracts from the 'Iranian  Interests
    Section  in  the  US'  which  describes  the   requirements   for   the
    registration of a marriage between  an  Iranian  man  and  a  woman  of
    foreign nationality. The extract indicated that  one  of  the  required
    documents was a certificate stating that the  Iranian  national's  wife
    had become Muslim. The expert additionally referred to an example of  a
    Conversion Form that [SM] would  need  to  complete  requiring  her  to
    confirm that she had abandoned Christianity and converted to Islam. The
    expert then made reference to the Iranian Ministry of  Foreign  Affairs
    website which again indicated that a conversion certificate relating to
    a wife's conversion to Islam was required.  I am wholly satisfied  that
    the expert supported his findings by reference to appropriate sources.

15.  The fact that conclusions of the same expert given in the case  of  SSH
    and HR were not fully accepted by the Upper Tribunal  does  not,  as  a
    matter of logic, undermine the reliability of the evidence given in the
    report before the judge.  The  issues  in  SSH  and  HR  were  entirely
    different. The expert was giving evidence in relation to the risk  that
    may be faced by somebody who left Iran illegally or who  was  a  failed
    asylum seeker. This stands in marked  contrast  to  the  assessment  of
    legal requirements contained within the  Iranian  legal  framework.  To
    suggest that Mr Kakhki's evidence was  wholly  rejected  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal or, as is implied in the grounds, that he was not accepted  as
    a legitimate or genuine expert is to wildly misrepresent the Tribunal's
    assessment in SSH and HR.  Whilst it is true that  some  assertions  he
    made were found to be without sufficient evidential  support  (consider
    for example paragraphs 31 and 32 and Appendix 1 of SSH  and  HR)  there
    was no challenge to his expertise, to his qualifications or  indeed  to
    his honesty.  I am satisfied that the judge was therefore  entitled  to
    rely on the referenced and sourced assertions contained in  the  report
    prepared for the First-tier Tribunal appeal.

16.  Nor do I find there to be any legal error in the judge's assessment  of
    the existence of insurmountable obstacles. The test  of  insurmountable
    obstacles is a  stringent  one  (see  for  example  the  Supreme  Court
    decision in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11). The judge's principal reasons  for
    concluding that there were  insurmountable  obstacles  related  to  the
    expert's conclusion that the marriage would  not  be  accepted  by  the
    Iranian authorities (see [58] of the judge's decision). The judge found
    that [SM], who was a devout Christian, was not willing to renounce  her
    faith (see [56]). Her religion was clearly an important element of  her
    life and the judge was fully entitled to regard the  inability  of  the
    family to live in Iran as husband and  wife  as  a  highly  significant
    matter.

17.  The judge additionally took into account the  language  issues,  [SM]'s
    nationality, her medical condition, her  employment  and  her  personal
    circumstances in the United Kingdom. It is however quite clear that the
    core reason for the judge's conclusion  that  insurmountable  obstacles
    existed was that the Iranian  state  would  simply  not  recognise  the
    marriage.  The  judge  correctly  identified  the  right  test  in  his
    assessment of insurmountable  obstacles,  he  considered  all  relevant
    evidence and he reached a conclusion that was rationally open to him on
    the basis of the evidence before him. In  these  circumstances  I  find
    that  the  judge  was  fully  entitled  to  conclude  that  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles. There is therefore no need for me to consider
    whether the judge erred in law in his assessment of Article  8  outside
    of the Immigration Rules. I simply note that the judge  manifestly  had
    regard to the relevant factors identified in Section  117B.  For  these
    reasons I find there is no material error of  law  and  I  dismiss  the
    appellant's appeal.
