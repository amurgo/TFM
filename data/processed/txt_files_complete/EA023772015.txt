                                   Between

                              Shehzad arshad
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                           ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER
                                                                  Respondent


                                  DECISION

 1. In her decision granting permission to appeal,  in  the  light  of  the
    decision in Khan v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2017]
    EWCA Civ 175 Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede stated that she was minded  to
    extend time for applying for permission to appeal, to find an error  of
    law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and remit the appeal  to
    the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. Neither party has dissented from those proposals within the 7 day  time
    period given by Judge Kebede and on behalf of the  appellant  there  is
    positive assent to them.

 3. Accordingly, it being agreed that there is  an  error  of  law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal, the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is set aside and the appeal  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a hearing de novo before a  judge  other  than  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Kelly.

 4. However, it  appears  to  me  that  Judge  Kelly's  decision  gives  an
    incorrect date  of  decision  and  refers  to  the  respondent  as  the
    Secretary of State. In fact, it appears that the decision is a  refusal
    of entry clearance dated 18 September  2015.  However,  that  does  not
    affect the error of law, set aside and remittal.

 5. In so far as human rights issues are relevant, it further appears to me
    that Judge Kelly was correct in what he said about Amirteymour although
    the  operative  decision  is  now  that  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Amirteymour v The Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2017]
    EWCA Civ 353.


Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek                            13/03/18
