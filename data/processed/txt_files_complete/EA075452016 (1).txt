                               mr omar saleem
                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                   Appellant

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     The Appellant in person
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is a case in which the First-tier Tribunal refused the appellant's
    appeal on the sole basis of the decision in Sala [2016] UKUT  411.   It
    is now accepted that the decision in Sala was incorrectly decided - see
    SM (Algeria)v ECO [2018] UKSC 9. It therefore follows that the decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error of law and I
    set it aside.

 2.  As there was no proper consideration of the  appellant's  appeal,  and
    findings of fact I remit the decision to the First-tier Tribunal for  a
    fresh decision on all issues.



Notice of Decision


 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and I set it aside.

 2. I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh  decision  on
    all issues.



Signed                                  Date  27 April 2018
