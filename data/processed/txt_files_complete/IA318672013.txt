For the Appellant:           Mr Moksud, First Global Immigration
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan date of  birth  25th  September
    1949.  She  appeals  with  permission[1]  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Manuel[2] to dismiss her appeal against the Respondent's
    decision to curtail her leave to enter the United Kingdom as a visitor,
    that decision being made at Manchester Airport on the 24th August 2013.


 2. The Appellant has been a regular visitor to the  United  Kingdom  since
    2001: she has two sons and two daughters in the UK. On  the  date  that
    she last sought entry she  was  stopped  by  immigration  officials  at
    Manchester Airport. She was questioned about her use of the NHS, as was
    her son. She told officers that she  brought  her  diabetic  medication
    with her from Pakistan and that she has only ever used the  NHS  in  an
    emergency, ie if she ran out of medication. The Appellant  also  stated
    that she had once visited a hospital because she had a bad knee, was x-
    rayed and was given painkillers. A bag search was conducted and it  was
    found that the Appellant had a significant  quantity  of  prescription-
    only medications with her that had all been dispensed by pharmacies  in
    the UK.  The immigration officer conducted checks. It emerged that  the
    Appellant  had  registered  with  a  GP,  had  made  eleven  outpatient
    appointments with The Royal Blackburn Hospital and  had  received  over
    ï¿½2000 worth of treatment that she was not entitled to. The Officer  was
    satisfied  that  the  Appellant  had  deliberately  used  deception  in
    obtaining her visa and in seeking leave to enter.  She  had  failed  to
    disclose material facts, namely that she had registered  and  used  NHS
    services to which she was not entitled. Furthermore  she  had  provided
    the NHS with a different date of birth from that shown on her  passport
    and visa, indicating a further attempt to deceive.  The  Appellant  was
    accordingly refused leave to enter and  her  visa  cancelled.  She  was
    granted temporary admission to enable her  to  pursue  her  appeal  in-
    country.


 3. The appeal came before Judge Manuel in December 2013.   In  a  detailed
    determination she gives a number of reasons  why  she  found  that  the
    Appellant did indeed intend to deceive.  The Appellant was evasive when
    questioned at port. She had initially said that she brought everything,
    even her insulin, from Pakistan. When it was put to her that the labels
    showed that they were dispensed in the UK she contradicted her  earlier
    answer by acknowledging that in fact she did get some  medication  from
    here. The medications themselves indicated that they were all from  the
    UK.   Judge Manuel noted the Appellant's evidence that it was "not  her
    fault" since she had never been told  that  she  had  to  pay  for  the
    medication. She rejects that explanation, finding that  it  would  have
    been evident to the Appellant and her educated  family  members  -  all
    resident in the UK - that the Appellant was not entitled  to  free  NHS
    care. Similarly the Appellant's claim that the wrong date of birth held
    by her GP is the result of a "clerical error" is rejected. Judge Manuel
    notes that the Appellant had "selective memory" about whether  she  had
    provided the surgery with her passport when she first registered there.
     Evidence emerged during the hearing to indicate that  the  Appellant's
    use of the NHS was even greater than had first been shown. She admitted
    to seeing a diabetic specialist nurse on a  regular  basis  during  her
    prolonged  visits  here.  She   had   effectively   been   coming   for
    approximately  half  of  each  year  since  2001,  and  obtaining  free
    prescriptions and hospital appointments on  each  visit.  Judge  Manuel
    rejects as untrue the Appellant's claim that  she  could  not  remember
    having two procedures at The Royal Blackburn  Hospital,  including  one
    where a camera tube was inserted into her throat  to  look  inside  her
    stomach. Having taken all of the evidence into account Judge Manuel was
    wholly satisfied that the Appellant had used deception. She upheld  the
    Respondent's decision and dismissed the appeal.


 4. The first ground of appeal is that the  determination  itself  contains
    clerical errors (for instance the Appellant has a daughter in  Belgium,
    not a son as recorded by Judge Manuel) and this means that the Tribunal
    should not have attached weight to the "clerical error" on the part  of
    GP staff. This is not a legal challenge. It is a fatuous  argument.  It
    is plain from the determination overall that the Judge assessed all  of
    the evidence in the round before upholding the allegation of deception.
     See for instance paragraph 50 where she says that she has  "considered
    the evidence as a whole".


 5. It is next alleged that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  failing  to
    take account of the fact that the Appellant has now offered to pay  for
    the treatment she has received. That  is  entirely  irrelevant  to  the
    matter of her past conduct. Now that she  has  been  discovered  it  is
    hardly surprising that she has offered to pay.

 6. Astonishingly the grounds next plead that the Appellant did not in fact
    attend the eleven outpatient  appointments  that  were  made  for  her.
    Before me Mr  Moksud  pursued  this  point,  submitting  that  passport
    records show that she was in fact in Pakistan for a number of  them.  I
    am incredulous that the Appellant's representatives consider this to be
    a good point. If Judge Manuel omitted to look at  this  travel  history
    then this has only  saved  the  Appellant  from  the  further  negative
    finding that I am about to make: she took the NHS so for  granted  that
    she and her  family  considered  it  acceptable  to  take  up  precious
    appointment time and not even bother to turn up.

 7. The grounds close by submitting that "no  consideration  was  given  to
    human rights. The appellant is an old lady, she is sick and is a  widow
    and needs care and compassion  from  her  family".  Her  family  should
    perhaps have considered this before they connived on numerous occasions
    for her to breach the conditions attached to her stay as a visitor.  On
    the facts before me the Appellant was not so sick that she was not able
    to take regular long distance flights and to live without her  UK-based
    family in Pakistan for at  least  half  of  the  year.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal make unambiguous findings that the Appellant, and her  family,
    deliberately employed deception to enable her  to  access  services  to
    which she was not entitled over a 12 year period.  It is  inconceivable
    that  the  fact  that  she  is  a  widow  who  has  diabetes  would  be
    sufficiently compelling to found an arguable Article 8 claim  in  those
    circumstances. There was therefore no  error  in  not  addressing  this
    matter.




      Decision

 8. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an  error
    of law and it is upheld.
