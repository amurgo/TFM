                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Freer (the judge) who, in  a  decision  promulgated  on  8
         August 2019, dismissed the appellant's human rights appeal  against
         the respondent's decision of 23 January 2019 to  refuse  his  human
         rights claim (made in the context of an application for  Indefinite
         Leave to Remain under the long residence rules).



Background

      2. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh who was born on  11  July
         1984. He entered the UK on 9 February 2009 in order  to  study.  He
         was subsequently granted further leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Post
         Study) Migrant, and then as a Tier 4 (General) Student.  This  last
         period of leave was valid until 25 July  2016.  On  that  date  the
         appellant made an application for leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
         Migrant. This application was refused on 9 September 2016,  with  a
         right to Administrative Review. The appellant exercised  his  right
         to Administrative Review. On 27  October  2016  the  Administrative
         Review maintained the original decision.

      3. On 11 November 2016 the appellant made an application for leave  to
         remain on Form FLR (FP) based on  his  private/family  life.  On  9
         March 2018 the appellant varied this claim using Form FLR (HRO)  to
         a human rights claim outside the immigration rules. The  respondent
         purported  to  refuse  this  application  on  15  March  2018.  The
         appellant maintains that  he  never  received  this  decision.  The
         appellant purported to vary his  application  on  13  January  2019
         using the Form SET (LR) to one  based  on  his  being  continuously
         lawfully present in the UK for at least 10 years.

      4. The respondent did not accept the appellant's claim that he had  at
         least  10  years  continuous  lawful  residence.   The   respondent
         considered that the  appellant's  leave  to  remain  ceased  on  27
         October 2016. The respondent went on to  consider  the  appellant's
         human rights claim under Appendix FM and paragraph  276ADE  of  the
         immigration rules, and to consider whether there  were  exceptional
         circumstances outside the immigration rules  that  would  render  a
         refusal of leave  to  remain  a  breach  of  Article  8  ECHR.  The
         respondent concluded there would be no such breach.  The  appellant
         exercised his right  of  appeal  under  s.82  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.



The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

      5. The judge heard oral evidence from the appellant and considered two
         bundles  of  documents  provided  by  the  appellant.   The   judge
         summarised the Reasons for Refusal Letter.

      6. At [8] the judge stated,

             "The respondent suggested that leave  expired  on  27  October
             2016. It is said there was a year (dates  not  given)  without
             leave, presumably thought to be ending in late 2017.  This  is
             possibly derived from having continuous leave from 9  February
             2009 to 27 October 2016. That is a period of  8  years  and  2
             months."

      7. At [9] the judge stated,

             "I am not able to clarify that reasoning any further;  I  note
             that there was no mention of section  3C  of  the  Immigration
             Act, which presumably could have extended leave while applying
             on 11 November 2016."

      8. The judge  summarised  the  submissions  made  on  behalf  of  both
         parties. In the section of his decision containing his findings  of
         fact the judge noted that the appellant was married with  two  very
         young children, and that his  eldest  son  had  some  developmental
         concerns. The judge found that these developmental  concerns  could
         be addressed in Bangladesh [40]. The judge noted that  neither  the
         appellant nor his partner was British or settled in the UK [supra].
         The judge found that the family could relocate to Bangladesh.

      9. The judge then set out the requirements of paragraph 39E  (relating
         to a 'grace' period where an application has been  made  within  14
         days  of  an  applicant's  leave  expiring)  and   paragraph   276B
         (establishing the requirements for leave to remain on the basis  of
         long residence) of the immigration rules, and the conclusions of Mr
         Justice Sweeney in R (on the application of Ahmed) v  Secretary  of
         State for the  Home  Department  (para  276B  -  ten  years  lawful
         residence) [2019] UKUT 00010 (IAC), from paragraphs 73 to 80.

     10. At [50] the judge stated,

             "The  respondent  has  it  is  said   refused   one   of   the
             applications, done in March 2018 with only an out  of  country
             right of appeal, which right I find has  not  been  exercised.
             The Appellant has more importantly not sought either to obtain
             a copy of that  decision,  extend  time  for  that  appeal  or
             convert it to an in country right of appeal, an outcome  often
             achieved in this jurisdiction by pursuing a judicial review in
             the Upper Tribunal. This is a matter which the  Appellant  may
             want to raise with his representative on the issue of costs. I
             am surprised that a party can be told of a decision that  they
             say they do not have any it appear to have made no efforts  to
             secure a late copy thereafter. Time was running. It seems that
             section 3C leave expired before 10 years accrued, probably  in
             2018, so the Appellant never achieved the continuous lawful 10
             years he might otherwise now have."

             [judge's emphasis]

     11. Having found that section 3C leave stopped running  within  the  10
         year period, and having regard to  the  date  of  the  respondent's
         decision under appeal (23 January 2019), the judge found  that  the
         14 day grace period could not carry  the  appellant  through  to  9
         February 2019, the 10 year anniversary of his  arrival  date  [52].
         The judge concluded that the appellant had not achieved at least 10
         years continuous lawful residence [54]. The judge  noted  that  the
         appellant's children had  not  resided  in  the  UK  "for  anything
         approaching 7 years" [55], that  neither  the  appellant,  nor  his
         partner, nor their children were British or settled in the UK,  and
         concluded that there would be no  significant  obstacles  on  their
         return to Bangladesh. The judge considered the evidence relating to
         the private lives established by the appellant and  his  family  in
         the UK, with reference to s.55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
         Immigration Act 2009, s.117B of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
         Asylum Act 2002, and the authorities of Razgar [2004] UKHL  27  and
         Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11, and weighed these  up  against  the  public
         interest ([58] to [66]). The judge concluded that  the  appellant's
         removal would not result in unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  for
         him or his family. The appeal was dismissed.



The challenge to the judge's decision

     12. Permission was sought two grounds, but granted on only one  ground.
         There has been no challenge respect  of  the  refusal  on  the  2nd
         ground, and I say no more about it.

     13. The appellant contends that the judge made a finding of  fact  that
         he held section 3C leave (that is, leave pursuant to section 3C  of
         the Immigration Act 1971) up to 15 March 2018. The appellant relies
         on what the judge said at [9] and  [50],  as  set  out  above.  The
         appellant contends that  the  respondent  has  not  challenged  the
         judge's findings. On the basis  that  section  3C  leave  continued
         until the decision purportedly made on 15 March 2018, and in  light
         of the appellant's assertion that  the  purported  decision  of  15
         March  2018  was  not  lawfully  served  in  accordance  with   the
         requirements of the Immigration (Leave to Enter and  Remain)  Order
         2000 (as amended), the appellant's section 3C leave continued.  The
         grounds note that the purported decision of 15 March  2018  was  an
         unpublished document as it was not served by the respondent (indeed
         there was no bundle of documents from the respondent at  all).  The
         judge failed to reach a decision  on  this  issue,  and  failed  to
         consider the relevance of the absence  of  the  purported  decision
         dated 15 March 2018.

     14. At the error of law hearing Mr Saini sought  to  adopt  and  expand
         upon his grounds. I drew to his attention a point  clear  from  his
         own grounds of appeal (at [11]  and  [12]),  that  the  appellant's
         application for further leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)
         Migrant was refused on 9 September 2016 and that his Administrative
         Review, maintaining the earlier  decision,  was  determined  on  27
         October 2016. I ascertained that Mr  Saini  was  aware  of  section
         3C(2)(c) of the Immigration Act 1971, which reads,

             'The leave is extended by virtue of  the  section  during  any
             period when -

             (a)  ...

             (b)  ...

             (c)  ...

             (d)   an  Administrative  Review  of  the  decision   on   the
             application for variation -

                  (i)  could be sought, or

                  (ii) is pending'

     15. I indicated that, on my preliminary view, the  appellant's  section
         3C leave expired on 27 October 2016 in accordance  with  the  above
         provision.  There  had  been  a  decision   in   respect   of   the
         Administrative Review and it was neither being sought nor  pending.
         Mr Saini submitted that the  judge  found,  as  a  fact,  that  the
         appellant had section 3C leave until March 2018, that this  factual
         finding had not been challenged by the respondent, that I was bound
         by the judges factual finding and that he  (Mr  Saini)  was  simply
         completing the judge's 'circle of thinking'.

     16. I gave Mr Saini  an  opportunity  to  take  instructions  from  the
         appellant. On his return Mr Saini indicated that there was  nothing
         further  he  wished  to  add  to  his  submissions.  He  sought  an
         adjournment of the appeal on the basis that the Upper Tribunal  may
         he planning to revisit the decision in R  (on  the  application  of
         Ahmed) but he could provide no  specific  details.  I  refused  the
         application to adjourn due to the absence of  details  and  because
         the issue of section 3C leave in the present appeal was clear  cut.
         Having heard from Mr Saini I indicated that  the  appeal  would  be
         dismissed.



Discussion

     17. Mr Saini's ground  of  appeal  relies  on  what  he  claims  is  an
         unchallenged factual finding by the judge. I am not persuaded  that
         the judge did  make  clear  factual  findings  in  respect  of  the
         appellant's leave under section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971.  At
         [9] the judge exclaimed that section  3C  could  "presumably"  have
         extended the appellant's leave when he made an  application  on  11
         November 2016. There is no clear finding by the judge. At [50]  the
         judge was not clear  as  to  when  he  believed  section  3C  leave
         expired, stating that it was "probably in 2018." But in any  event,
         the question whether leave to remain is extended under  section  3C
         is not a factual question but a legal one. The law on this point is
         clear. In the context of an Administrative Review,  leave  will  be
         extended by virtue of section 3C whilst the  Administrative  Review
         is being sought or while it is pending. If a  final  Administrative
         Review decision has been made, section 3C leave  will  come  to  an
         end.

     18. There was no dispute between the parties  that  the  Administrative
         Review decision in respect of the appellant's Tier 1 (entrepreneur)
         Migrant application was made on 27 October 2016.  After  this  date
         the appellant no longer had any lawful leave to remain in  the  UK.
         To proceed with the appeal on any other view would be to ignore the
         legal reality and to engage in legal fiction.

     19. The appellant's section 3C leave expired on 27 October 2016. He has
         not had any lawful leave since that date. The appellant could  not,
         on any rational  view,  contend  that  he  had  achieved  10  years
         continuous lawful residents in the UK as he arrived on  9  February
         2009. Any failure by the  judge  to  engage  with  the  appellant's
         contention that the purported decision of  9  March  2018  was  not
         lawfully served on him cannot assist him. Any such mistake  by  the
         judge was not a legal error requiring the decision to be set aside.





Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed.
