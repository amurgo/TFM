                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT


                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellants:    Mr M Iqbal of Counsel instructed by Britain
Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Presenting Officer.


                           DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants having been refused their applications  for  asylum  and
  humanitarian protection by the respondent on 17 July 2015 appealed to the
  First tier Tribunal and their appeals were heard at Hatton  Cross  on  23
  November 2015 by Judge L K Gibbs. For reasons given in the  determination
  the appeals were dismissed sand the  appellants  obtained  permission  to
  appeal to the Upper Tribunal which was granted by Judge Shimmin, a  Judge
  of the First tier Tribunal for  reasons  given  in  her  decision  of  20
  January 2016.

2.    At the  hearing  before  me  Mr  Jarvis  representing  the  respondent
  conceded that the grounds upon which permission had been  granted  showed
  that in deciding the appeals, the First  tier  Judge  had  made  material
  errors of law. He asked that the determination of  Judge  L  K  Gibbs  be
  struck down and it be directed that the appeals are heard afresh  by  the
  First tier Tribunal. Ms Heller of  Counsel  representing  the  appellants
  agreed. I was in agreement with the views of Mr Jarvis and Ms Heller.

3.    Accordingly, I allow these appeals and  direct  that  these  be  heard
  afresh by any First Tier Tribunal Judge other than Judge L K Gibbs.

 Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal.
