                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this appeal the Appellant is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department.  The Respondent is the Claimant.

2.   The Claimant, a national  of  Cameroon,  appealed  against  the  SSHD's
    decision to refuse an asylum claim on 9 February 2017.  The appeal  was
    dismissed by FtT Judge I Howard on 27  November  2017.   Permission  to
    appeal the Judge's decision was given to the SSHD on 29 December  2017.
    A cross appeal was given permission on 15 February 2018 by UTJ King TD.

3.   It is clear that the Judge rejected the appeal on the findings of  fact
    but in error went on to allow the  appeal  on  Refugee  Convention  and
    Article 3 ECHR grounds.  On that basis it could have  been  dealt  with
    under the Slip Rule [Rule 31 of The Tribunal Procedure Rules 2014].

4.   The cross appeal is based upon  the  Judge's  failure  to  address  the
    psychiatric assessment of the Claimant's mental health/suicide risk and
    the assessment of him being a victim of torture.

5.   The parties jointly submitted that  the  Judge's  errors,  particularly
    the consideration of the  Claimant's  mental  health,  required  a  re-
    assessment of the adverse credibility findings.

6.   I agree with them.  The original Tribunal's decision cannot  stand  nor
    any findings of fact.

NOTICE OF DECISION

7.   The appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed to the extent that  the
    matter must be re-made in the FtT (IAC).

    No anonymity order is required.
