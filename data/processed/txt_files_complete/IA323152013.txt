For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No representative

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The Secretary of State appeals against a decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal (Judge Trevaskis) allowing Ms Tran's appeal against a refusal
      of the grant of her leave  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  under
      Appendix FM and para 276ADE  of  the  Immigration  Rules  (HC  395  as
      amended).

   2. For convenience, I  will  hereafter  refer  to  the  parties  as  they
      appeared before the First-tier Tribunal.

Introduction

   3. The appellant is a citizen of Vietnam who was born on 4 June 1983.  In
      October 2008, she met Nicholas Booth (the Sponsor), a British citizen.
         He  was  in  Vietnam  teaching  English.   Shortly   thereafter   a
      relationship developed between them and they became engaged  to  marry
      in December 2010.  They lived together  covertly  in  Vietnam  as  the
      appellant's family disapproved of the relationship.

   4. In 2010, they decided to leave Vietnam.  The appellant left first  and
      travelled to Spain in March 2012 to pursue her education  by  studying
      Spanish and child development.  Mr Booth returned to the  UK  in  June
      2012  to  study  a  Masters  in  Educational  Psychology  at   Bristol
      University.  He visited the appellant regularly in Spain.

   5. On 31 October 2012, the appellant was granted  entry  clearance  as  a
      visitor valid until 30 April 2013.  The appellant visited Mr Booth and
      his family over the Christmas period in 2012.  During that  time,  the
      appellant became pregnant.  She returned to Spain where she discovered
      in February 2013 that she was pregnant and returned to the  UK  on  25
      March 2013 to spend Easter with the sponsor and his family.   She  has
      remained in the UK since that time.

   6. On 29 April 2013, the appellant applied for leave  to  remain  as  the
      partner of the sponsor.  On 11  July  2013,  the  Secretary  of  State
      refused  to  vary  her  leave  to  remain  on  that  basis  under  the
      Immigration Rules (Appendix FM and para 276ADE) and on an  exceptional
      basis outside the Rules under Article 8 of the ECHR.  The Secretary of
      State also  made  a  decision  to  remove  the  appellant  by  way  of
      directions under s.47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act
      2012.

   7. On 31 August 2013, the appellant gave birth to the son of herself  and
      the sponsor.

The Appeal

   8. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

   9. In a determination promulgated  on  31  March  2014,  Judge  Trevaskis
      allowed the appellant's appeal under para 276  ADE(vi)  on  the  basis
      that, although the appellant had not lived in the UK for 20 years, she
      had lost "all ties with Vietnam".

  10. On 19 May 2014, the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Gibb)  granted  the
      Secretary of State permission to appeal.

  11. The appeal initially came  before  me  on  9  September  2014.   In  a
      decision dated 17 September 2014,  I  concluded  that  the  First-tier
      Tribunal had erred in law in applying para 276ADE(vi).  My reasons are
      set out in  full  in  that  decision.   I  set  aside  the  First-tier
      Tribunal's decision to allow the appeal under para 276ADE and I remade
      the decision dismissing the appeal under para 276ADE on the basis that
      the appellant had failed to establish that  she  had  no  "ties"  with
      Vietnam.

  12. However, as a result of his finding in favour of the  appellant  under
      the Immigration Rules, Judge Trevaskis had not gone on to consider the
      appellant's claim under Article 8.  I adjourned the hearing  in  order
      that the parties,  in  particular  the  appellant,  could  submit  any
      updating evidence concerning the sponsor's current  income  and  their
      circumstances as relevant to the issue  of  whether  the  respondent's
      decision breached Article 8 of the ECHR.

  13. The appeal was listed for a resumed hearing on 11 November  2014.   At
      that hearing, the appellant and sponsor were present but had no  legal
      representation.   The  Secretary  of  State  was  represented  by   Mr
      Richards.

  14. I heard brief submissions from Mr Richards and Mr Booth spoke  on  the
      appellant's behalf.  He provided me with a contract of employment as a
      support trainer with "Developing Health and  Independence"  commencing
      on 13 January 2014 with an annual salary of �23,188.  He also provided
      me with a supporting letter signed by him and the appellant.

Discussion and Findings

  15. The appellant's claim relies solely upon Article 8 of the ECHR.  As  a
      result of her original application, the appellant  could  not  succeed
      under the partner route in Appendix FM, namely R-LTRP as she  did  not
      qualify as a "partner" under GEN 1.2(iv) as she and  the  sponsor  had
      not been "living together....in a relationship akin to  marriage...for
      at least two years prior to the date of application".   Further, as  a
      result of my earlier decision, the appellant could not  succeed  under
      para 276ADE, in particular para 276ADE(vi).

  16. Article 8 of the ECHR provides as follows:

           "1    Everyone has the right to  respect  for  his  private  and
                 family life, his home and his correspondence.

           2.    There shall be no interference by a public authority  with
                 the exercise of this right except such as is in  accordance
                 with the law and is necessary in a  democratic  society  in
                 the interests of national security, public  safety  or  the
                 economic well being of the country, for the  prevention  of
                 disorder or crime, for the protection of health or  morals,
                 or for  the  protection  of  the  rights  and  freedoms  of
                 others."

  17. The burden of proof is upon the appellant to establish on a balance of
      probabilities a breach of Art 8 and, in particular, that  Art  8.1  is
      engaged and it is for the Respondent to justify and interference under
      Art 8.2.

  18. The essence of the appellant's claim is that her  removal  to  Vietnam
      will be a disproportionate interference with her family  life  enjoyed
      with the sponsor and between the sponsor and their son.

  19. That issue is the fifth stage of Lord Bingham's well-known  five-stage
      test in R(Razgar) v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27 at [17]).   As  the  appellant
      cannot  succeed  under  the  Immigration  Rules,  she  must  establish
      'exceptional' or  'compelling'  circumstances  which  will  result  in
      unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  if  she  is  removed  (see,   e.g.
      MF(Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192; R(Nagre) v SSHD  [2013]  EWHC
      720 (Admin)).

  20. In his submissions, Mr Richards did not argue that Article 8  was  not
      engaged.   He  accepted  that  there  was  a  genuine  and  subsisting
      relationship between the sponsor and the appellant and that  that  had
      resulted in the birth of their son.  There is  no  doubt  that  family
      life exists between the sponsor and appellant who have lived together,
      at least, since March 2013 when she last came to the UK.  They had, of
      course, previously lived together in Vietnam.  Equally, it  is  beyond
      doubt that the relationship between the appellant and sponsor (on  the
      one hand) and their son (on the other hand) amounts to family life for
      the purposes of Article 8.

  21. I am satisfied that if the appellant is required to return to  Vietnam
      (whether permanently or only temporarily  in  order  to  obtain  entry
      clearance) there will be a sufficiently serious interference with  the
      family life between her and the sponsor and between their son and  the
      sponsor so as to engage Article 8.1.  I am satisfied that it would not
      be reasonable to expect the sponsor to leave the UK and live with  the
      appellant in Vietnam.  The sponsor is a British citizen and  his  life
      is now orientated around this country.  He  has  recently  obtained  a
      Masters in  Educational  Psychology  at  Bristol  University  and  has
      obtained permanent employment since January 2014.  In their supporting
      letter the sponsor says this:

           "It might be argued that it is reasonable for me  to  return  to
           Vietnam with Loan and our son. In doing  so,  however,  I  would
           have to resign from my job and give up our home leaving my wider
           family and friends behind.  I would be  leaving  for  a  country
           whose language I do not speak and whose culture I have  no  ties
           to.  It again, seems 'unduly harsh' to expect a British  citizen
           to leave the country in which he was born and raised to go to  a
           country that offers  him  little  opportunity  for  work  or  to
           integrate."

  22. I accept that evidence (as I do all the evidence of the appellant  and
      sponsor) which was not challenged by Mr  Richards.   Even  though  the
      sponsor did at one time live in Vietnam, his life has moved  on  since
      then by him obtaining a Masters degree and permanent job  in  the  UK.
      It would not, in my view be reasonable to expect him to now leave  the
      UK and live in Vietnam with the appellant and their son.

  23. For these reasons, I am satisfied that Article 8.1 is engaged.

  24. There is no doubt that the respondent's  decision  was  in  accordance
      with the law and that the decision pursues a legitimate aim namely the
      economic well-being of the country reflected, as  commonly  expressed,
      by effective immigration control.

  25. The crucial issue in this appeal,  as  Mr  Richards  accepted  in  his
      submissions, is whether the appellant's removal to  Vietnam  would  be
      disproportionate.

  26. The issue of proportionality involves a  balancing  exercise  weighing
      the public  interest  against  the  particular  circumstances  of  the
      appellant and also the sponsor and their  son  whose  rights  must  be
      taken into account (see respectively Razgar v SSHD [2004] UKHL  27  at
      [20] and Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008] UKHL 39).

  27. In determining whether the Secretary of State has established that any
      interference with the appellant, sponsor and  their  son's  Article  8
      rights are justified under Article 8.2, I must also have regard to the
      considerations set out in s.117B of the Nationality,  Immigration  and
      Asylum Act 2002 even though the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  was
      taken before s.117B came into force on 28 July 2014 (see YM (Uganda) v
      SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 1292).

  28. S.117B provides as follows:

           "117B Article 8: public interest  considerations  applicable  in
           all cases

                  1) The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is
                     in the public interest.

                  2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
                     interests of the economic  well-being  of  the  United
                     Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or  remain  in
                     the United Kingdom are able to speak English,  because
                     persons who can speak English -

                        a) are less of a burden on taxpayers; and

                        b) are better able to integrate into society.

                  3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
                     interests of the economic  well-being  of  the  United
                     Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or  remain  in
                     the  United  Kingdom  are   financially   independent,
                     because such persons -

                        a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

                        b) are better able to integrate into society.

                  4) Little weight should be given to -

                        a) private life, or

                        b) a relationship formed with a qualifying  partner,
                           that is established by a person at  a  time  when
                           the person is in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

                  5) Little weight  should  be  given  to  a  private  life
                     established by a person at a time  when  the  person's
                     immigration status is precarious.

                  6) In  the  case  of  a  person  who  is  not  liable  to
                     deportation, the public interest does not require  the
                     persons' removal where -

                        a) the person has a genuine and subsisting  parental
                           relationship with a qualifying child, and

                        b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to
                           leave the United Kingdom."

  29. I must also take into account the "best interests" of the son  of  the
      appellant  and  sponsor  as  a  primary,  though  not   determinative,
      consideration (see ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] 2 AC 166  and  s.55  of
      the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act  2009).   In  considering
      the issue of the child's "best interests", the Supreme Court  set  out
      the principles to be applied in Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] UKSC 74 at  [10]
      as follows:

                  1) The best interests of a child are an integral part  of
                     the proportionality assessment under article 8 ECHR;

                  2) In making that assessment, the  best  interests  of  a
                     child must be a primary  consideration,  although  not
                     always the only primary consideration; and the child's
                     best interests do not of themselves have the status of
                     the paramount consideration;

                  3)  Although  the  best  interests  of  a  child  can  be
                     outweighed  by  the   cumulative   effect   of   other
                     considerations, no other consideration can be  treated
                     as inherently more significant;

                  4) While different judges might approach the question  of
                     the best interests of a child in different ways, it is
                     important to ask oneself the  right  questions  in  an
                     orderly manner in order to avoid  the  risk  that  the
                     best interests of a child might  be  undervalued  when
                     other important considerations were in play;

                  5) It is important to have a  clear  idea  of  a  child's
                     circumstances  and  of  what  is  in  a  child's  best
                     interests  before  one  asks  oneself  whether   those
                     interests  are  outweighed  by  the  force  of   other
                     considerations;

                  6) To that end there  is  no  substitute  for  a  careful
                     examination of all relevant factors when the interests
                     of a child are involved in an  article  8  assessment;
                     and

                  7) A child must not be blamed for matters for which he or
                     she is not responsible,  such  as  the  conduct  of  a
                     parent."

  30. In his submissions, Mr Richards accepted that the facts  were  not  in
      dispute.  Indeed, Mr Richards did not seek to  challenge  any  of  the
      evidence in the appeal.

  31. The essential facts are as follows.  The sponsor is a British citizen.
       A relationship developed between the sponsor and appellant after they
      met in Vietnam in October 2008 where they became engaged to be married
      in December 2010.  They lived together in Vietnam from 2010 until  the
      appellant left to pursue her education is Spain in  March  2012.   The
      sponsor returned to the UK in June 2012  and  obtained  a  Masters  in
      Educational Psychology at Bristol University and a  permanent  job  in
      the UK in January 2014.  The sponsor regularly visited  the  appellant
      in Spain.  The appellant came to the UK to visit the sponsor  and  his
      family over the Christmas period in 2012  when  she  became  pregnant.
      Having returned to Spain in February 2013, and having discovered  that
      she was pregnant, she returned to the UK  to  spend  Easter  with  the
      sponsor and his family in March 2013.  They have lived together  in  a
      relationship "akin to marriage" since that time and, I  am  satisfied,
      did so also between 2010 and March 2012 in Vietnam.   It  is  accepted
      that their relationship is a genuine and subsisting one.

  32. As I have already concluded,  it  would  not  be  reasonable  for  the
      sponsor to return to Vietnam in order to  live  permanently  with  the
      sponsor and their son.  The  disruption  to  his  life  which  is  now
      settled in the UK would be unduly harsh.

  33. The sponsor has a permanent job in the UK and  earns  a  gross  annual
      salary of �23,188 which exceeds the required sum for  entry  clearance
      as a spouse or partner under Appendix FM.  Mr Richards did not suggest
      anything to the contrary in his submissions.

  34. Further, I accept  the  evidence  that  the  sponsor's  wider  family,
      including their son's grandparents, uncles, aunties and cousins form a
      close family in the UK with the family unit made up of the  appellant,
      sponsor and their son.

  35. The evidence of the appellant and sponsor is that the  sponsor  has  a
      "very strong" attachment to his son which would adversely  affect  him
      "emotionally and psychologically" if  the  appellant  with  their  son
      returned to Vietnam.  Although no independent evidence was put  before
      me concerning the best interests of their child, I am  satisfied  that
      it is in the best interests of their son to be brought up by both  the
      appellant and sponsor who, I have no doubt, are loving and  supportive
      parents.  I am in no doubt that it is in their  son's  best  interests
      that the family unit of the appellant, sponsor and  their  son  should
      remain in tact.

  36. The evidence accepted before Judge Trevaskis (and  which  is  not  now
      challenged) is that as a result of  the  appellant  becoming  pregnant
      outside of marriage, her family and friends in Vietnam have ostracised
      her.  I accept that finding.  The consequence is that if the appellant
      were to return with their son  to  Vietnam  she  would  not  have  the
      support of her family and friends there.  That is not, in my view,  in
      the best interests of their son.

  37. Taking all these matters into account, I am satisfied  that  the  best
      interests of the child are to remain with the appellant and sponsor in
      a family unit in the United Kingdom.

  38. Taking the child's best interests  as  a  primary  consideration,  the
      issue remains, therefore, whether the public interest outweighs  those
      best interests and the rights of the appellant and sponsor?

  39.  First,  by  virtue  of  s.117B(1),  the  maintenance   of   effective
      immigration control is in the public interest.  Secondly, by virtue of
      s.117B(2), the ability to speak English is  a  matter  in  the  public
      interest.  The evidence, which I accept, is that the appellant has the
      required qualification in English language and uses English on a daily
      basis in the family home and wider community.  Thirdly, the  appellant
      is "financially independent" and will not be a burden on the  taxpayer
      in the UK because the sponsor (whom I accept  will  support  her)  has
      sufficient income to support the family unit.  That is  also  "in  the
      public interest" under s.117B(3).  Fourthly, this is not  a  situation
      where the relationship between the appellant and  sponsor  was  formed
      whilst the appellant was "unlawfully" in the UK (see s.117B(4)).   The
      appellant entered the United Kingdom with leave as a visitor  and  her
      leave has been continued under s.3C of the Immigration Act 1971 during
      the course of  her  application  for  further  leave  and  the  appeal
      proceedings.  Fifthly, this is not a case where the appellant's  claim
      rests upon her "private life" in the UK such that it should  be  given
      little  weight  while  her  immigration  status  is  precarious   (see
      s.117B(5)).  The appellant's claim rests upon her "family life" in the
      UK.

  40. Finally, s.117B(6) states that the public interest "does not  require"
      the appellant's removal, as she has a genuine and subsisting  parental
      relationship with a qualifying child (namely her son)  and  "it  would
      not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom".

  41. In his submissions, Mr Richards submitted that the key issue  in  this
      appeal was the application of s.117B(6) and whether it was  reasonable
      to expect the child to  leave  the  UK.   He  submitted  that  it  was
      perfectly reasonable to expect the appellant to leave the  UK  and  by
      extension perfectly reasonable to expect the child to leave with  her.



  42. I do not accept that submission.  Given the Judge's finding as to  the
      circumstances  in  which  the  appellant  and  their  son  would  find
      themselves in Vietnam, I am satisfied that it would not be  reasonable
      for the appellant to return there with their son.  It would not be  in
      his best interests to live in Vietnam with the appellant but rather it
      is in his best interests to remain in his family unit  living  in  the
      UK.  Although it is not determinative, I take into account  the  close
      tie that I accept exists between the sponsor  and  his  son.   I  also
      accept that the child will be deprived of the support and  comfort  of
      the sponsor's wider family which is part of a close family in the  UK.
      Having been deprived of that family in the UK, the child would  return
      to Vietnam with, effectively, no family  given  the  attitude  of  the
      appellant's family to her because of the shame  she  is  perceived  to
      have brought upon the family by becoming pregnant whilst not  married.
      I am satisfied, therefore, that s.117B(6) applies in this appeal.  The
      wording of it - "the public interest does  not  require  the  person's
      removal" - may well  mean  that  in  itself  the  public  interest  in
      effective  immigration  control  is  outweighed  and  the  appellant's
      removal is not proportionate.  In any event, it is a  factor  of  some
      weight in carrying out the balancing exercise inherent in the issue of
      proportionality under Article 8.2.  I have already set out  the  other
      relevant factors.

  43. It was not argued by Mr Richards that the appellant should  return  to
      Vietnam in order to seek entry clearance as a partner.  To the  extent
      that such an argument could be made, I do not consider  it  reasonable
      to require the appellant to do so given that her relationship with the
      sponsor is accepted as a genuine one which has subsisted  both  during
      their time in Vietnam and, since March 2012, in the UK when they  have
      lived together in a relationship "akin to marriage".  I do not see any
      useful  purpose  reflecting  the  public  interest  in  requiring  the
      appellant  to  disrupt  her  family  life  with  the   sponsor   (even
      temporarily), and given the impact upon her and their son of returning
      to Vietnam, in requiring them to do so, (see Chikwamba v  SSHD  [2005]
      EWCA Civ 1779 and SSHD v Hayat and Another [2012] EWCA Civ 1054).

  44. Taking all these matters into account  including  that  the  appellant
      cannot meet the requirements of the Rules, I am satisfied  that  there
      are 'compelling' circumstances which outweigh the public  interest  in
      this appeal.

  45. For these reasons, the Secretary of State has not established that the
      appellant's removal to Vietnam would be justified under Article 8.2 of
      the ECHR.

  46. Consequently, I am satisfied that the  respondent's  decision  not  to
      grant the appellant leave to remain on the basis of  her  relationship
      with the sponsor breached Article 8 of the ECHR.

Decision

  47. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  allow  the  appellant's
      appeal involved the making of an error of law.  That decision  is  set
      aside.  To that extent the Secretary of State's appeal  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal is allowed.

  48. I remake the decision:

           (1) I dismiss  the  appellant's  appeal  under  the  Immigration
           Rules; but

           (2) I allow the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR.

                                                                     A Grubb

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have allowed the appeal under Art 8  and,  having  considered  whether  to
make a fee award, I make a full fee award.

                                                                      Signed





                                                                     A Grubb
