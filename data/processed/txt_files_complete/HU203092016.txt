For the Appellant:        Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Ethnic
Minorities Law Centre
For the Respondent:     Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This determination follows on from:

      i) The ECO's decision dated 27 July 2016.

     ii) The appellant's grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

    iii) The decision of FtT Judge  Buckwell,  promulgated  on  14  December
         2017.

     iv) The appellant's grounds of appeal to  the  UT,  as  stated  in  the
         application for permission to appeal filed with the FtT,  dated  21
         December 2017.

      v) The FtT's refusal of permission, dated 27 April 2018.

     vi) The appellant's grounds of appeal to  the  UT,  as  stated  in  the
         application for permission to appeal filed with the  UT,  dated  11
         May 2018.  (The grounds appear to be the same.)

    vii) The UT's grant of permission, dated 12 September 2018.

 2. The first ground is that the FtT considered the wrong immigration rule.
     The second ground is error in assessing  the  best  interests  of  the
    appellant as a child, and in assessing proportionality.

 3. Mr Matthews said that ground 1  would  have  been  resisted,  but  that
    ground  2  disclosed  error.   He   said   that   the   reasoning   was
    insufficiently clear.  The outcome appeared  to  turn  largely  on  the
    possibility of making another application, which was relevant but not a
    complete answer.  The grounds were  sufficient  to  justify  a  further
    hearing and a fresh decision, either in the UT or in the FtT.

 4. Mr Winter indicated that the sponsor recently returned from 3 weeks  in
    Cameroon,  and  that  it  now  appeared  that  the  evidence   required
    significant updating, such that the appellant  sought,  in  effect,  an
    entirely fresh hearing.

 5. The decision of the FtT is set aside. The nature of the  case  is  such
    that it is appropriate under section 12 of  the  2007  Act,  and  under
    Practice Statement 7.2, to remit to  the  FtT  for  an  entirely  fresh
    hearing.  The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are  not
    to include Judge Buckwell.

 6. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
