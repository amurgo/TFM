Representation
For the Appellants:          Mr Byrne, of Drummond Miller
For the Respondent:          Mr Mullen, Home Office Presenting Officer

Housing made available under any of the statutory  provisions  mentioned  in
sub-paragraph (a) of the definition of "public funds" in paragraph 6 of  the
Immigration Rules, whether or not in fulfilment of a duty to house  homeless
persons, is public funds, even where the tenure of the housing  is  governed
by some other statute.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, a mother and her eight children, are citizens of  Iraq.
    They applied to the respondent for entry clearance in  order  to  allow
    them to settle with the sponsor, who is the first  appellant's  husband
    and the father of the other appellants, in the United  Kingdom.   Their
    application was refused by notice of decision  dated  23  August  2006.
    They appealed to an Immigration Judge, who  allowed  the  appeal.   The
    respondent sought and obtained an order for reconsideration.  Thus  the
    matter comes before us.

 2. We are concerned with the accommodation available  to  the  appellants.
    The requirements of the Immigration Rules are  contained  in  paragraph
    281 (the first appellant) and paragraph 297 (for the other  appellants)
    of the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules,  HC  395.   Paragraph
    281(iv) requires the first appellant to show that:

        "there will be adequate  accommodation  for  the  parties  and  any
        dependants without recourse to public funds in accommodation  which
        they own or occupy exclusively."

    Paragraph 297(iv) imposes a complementary requirement  in  relation  to
    the children.

 3. There is no real dispute about the  facts.   The  sponsor  lives  in  a
    council house in Edinburgh.  It is sufficient for  his  needs,  but  it
    would be overcrowded if  the  appellants  joined  him  there.   It  is,
    therefore, not adequate accommodation.  If the appellants came  to  the
    United Kingdom, the sponsor would need to obtain a larger  house,  with
    four bedrooms.  He could not afford to pay the  open  market  rent  for
    such a house.  But if he got a council house, it would cost  about  ï¿½30
    per month more than he is currently paying, which he could afford.  The
    Immigration Judge considered that  the  principal  issue  for  him  was
    whether such a house would be available to the sponsor.  On  the  basis
    of the evidence before him, including a letter from the Housing  Advice
    and Information Officer of the North Edinburgh  local  office  dated  5
    January 2007, he considered that there was "just sufficient to allow me
    to conclude" that at the date of the decision  it  was  the  case  that
    adequate accommodation would be available to  the  appellants  if  they
    were admitted to the United Kingdom.  The respondent's application  for
    reconsideration was on the ground that the letter to which we have made
    reference post-dated the decision and ought therefore not to have  been
    taken into account, and that the position at the date of  the  decision
    was that there was no adequate accommodation available and no realistic
    prospect of there being such accommodation.  At an earlier  hearing  it
    was pointed out by the Tribunal that there was a further difficulty, in
    that the accommodation proposed might amount to public funds within the
    meaning of the Immigration Rules, and therefore could  not  enable  the
    appellants to establish that  they  would  be  adequately  accommodated
    without recourse to public funds.  Before us Mr Byrne on behalf of  the
    appellants acknowledged that his principal task was  to  show  us  that
    substitute and larger council housing, obtained by the sponsor in order
    to house his family, would not amount to public funds.

 4. Paragraph 6 of the Immigration Rules reads, in part, as follows:

        "'Public funds' means -
             (a)  housing under Part VI or VII of the Housing Act  1996  and
                 under Part II of the Housing Act 1985, Part I or II of  the
                 Housing  (Scotland)  Act  1987,  Part  II  of  the  Housing
                 (Northern Ireland) Order 1981 or Part  II  of  the  Housing
                 (Northern Ireland) Order 1988;
             ... ."

 5. Mr Byrne very helpfully provided copies  of  Parts  I  and  II  of  the
    Housing (Scotland)  Act  1987  and  also  of  Part  2  of  the  Housing
    (Scotland) Act 2001, together with a further production, consisting  of
    a letter from the Legal Services Division of  Edinburgh  City  Council,
    stating that:

        "In the event that [the  sponsor's]  family  are  admitted  to  the
        United Kingdom, the City of Edinburgh  Council  will  offer  him  a
        Scottish  secure  tenancy.   The  provisions  relating  to   secure
        tenancies are contained in the Housing (Scotland)  Act  2001,  Part
        2."

      Mr Byrne's submission was that the housing  provided  to  the  sponsor
    and to the appellants would be  provided  to  them  under  the  Housing
    (Scotland) Act 2001 not under the 1987 Act,  and  would  therefore  not
    amount to "public funds".

 6. As  we  indicated  at  the  hearing,  we  are  unable  to  accept  that
    submission.  Part 2 of the 2001 Act contains the provisions relating to
    Scottish secure tenancies, including provisions which have  the  effect
    that ordinary lettings of dwelling houses by local authority  landlords
    are Scottish secure tenancies and are therefore subject to the terms of
    that  Act.   The  2001  Act  does  not,  however,  contain  the   local
    authorities' powers to provide housing or to allocate it.  Those are in
    the 1987 Act.  Mr Byrne submitted that the provisions of Parts I and II
    of the 1987 Act are concerned solely with the homeless and  others  who
    have an urgent need for housing to be provided for them entirely at the
    cost of the authority.  That does not appear to us to be right.  Part I
    of the 1987 Act imposes on local authorities the duty to  consider  the
    needs of their areas and confers on  them  powers  to  provide  housing
    accommodation by building, acquiring, converting, or  improving  houses
    and so on.  That Part also contains supplementary  provisions  enabling
    local authorities to maintain  housing  lists  for  the  allocation  of
    housing, to make and publish rules and to  make  by-laws  for  a  local
    authority's houses.  We were shown nothing  to  suggest  that  Scottish
    local authorities have power to obtain or retain  a  stock  of  council
    houses save by virtue of Part I of the 1987 Act.

 7. Part II of the 1987 Act is headed "Homeless Persons".   It  contains  a
    number of provisions relating to the definition and housing of homeless
    persons.  Importantly, it  includes  provisions  for  housing  homeless
    persons either in properties owned by the council, or  by  the  council
    paying for their housing in properties which it does not own (but which
    belong, for example, to a charity).  Thus, as it seems to us,  Parts  I
    and II together contain the provisions which are the  foundation  of  a
    council's provision of housing to individuals: either  it  is  provided
    from the housing stock which the council has under Part  I,  or  it  is
    provided by the council under the additional powers it has in  relation
    to homeless persons under Part II.  Mr Byrne's suggestion that  housing
    provided to the appellant would not be provided "under" the  1987  Act,
    because the terms of the tenancy would be governed by the 2001  Act  is
    untenable: there could be no tenancy unless the council was enabled  by
    the 1987 Act to have a house to let to the appellant.  Mr Byrne further
    submitted that, given that Part I of the 1987 Act contains of itself no
    provisions relating to the letting of houses to  council  tenants,  the
    mere fact that the 1987 Act gave the  council  power  to  maintain  the
    housing stock could not mean that individual housing would  be  "under"
    the 1987 Act.  But we do not think that there is any reason to  suppose
    that the phrase used in paragraph 6 is  not  the  appropriate  one  for
    describing council housing.  Part I is headed "Provision  of  housing",
    and s35(1)(a) (which is in Part  II),  for  example,  provides  that  a
    homeless person may be housed:-

        "By making available accommodation held by  [the  local  authority]
        under Part I".

 8. Whatever the terms of the tenancy, housing provided to a council tenant
    in Scotland from a housing stock acquired and maintained under  Part  I
    of the 1987 Act or provided to a homeless person in Scotland under  the
    provisions of Part II of the 1987 Act amounts to "public funds" for the
    purposes of paragraph 6 of the Immigration Rules.

 9. We observe, although it was, in the circumstances, not the  subject  of
    any submission before us, that the relevant  provisions  of  the  other
    enactments mentioned in paragraph 6 are to the same effect to those  to
    which we were referred.  They contain provisions enabling the  relevant
    authorities to acquire and maintain a stock of housing and to  allocate
    it, and provisions relative to the housing of homeless persons.   Thus,
    in general, housing provided by  local  authorities  and  others  whose
    powers derive from the legislation in  question,  whether  or  not  for
    those who would otherwise  be  homeless,  is  "public  funds"  for  the
    purposes of the Immigration Rules.

10. For the foregoing reasons the appellants have failed to establish  that
    on arrival they would have available  to  them  adequate  accommodation
    without recourse to public funds.  The Immigration Judge erred  in  law
    in determining the appeal in  the  appellants'  favour  without  proper
    regard to the provisions of the Immigration  Rules.   We  substitute  a
    determination dismissing their appeals.
