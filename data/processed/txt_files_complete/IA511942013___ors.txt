                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Secretary of State has appealed against a decision of Judge of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Raikes (the judge) promulgated on 23rd July 2014.

 2. The Respondents before the Upper Tribunal were  the  Appellants  before
    the First-tier Tribunal and I will refer to them as the claimants.

 3. The first and second claimants are married and are the parents  of  the
    third and fourth claimants born 12th October 2000 and 29th  March  2003
    respectively.  The first claimant entered the United  Kingdom  on  21st
    July 2007 with leave as a student.  He was subsequently joined  by  his
    family members.  His leave as a student was extended until 22nd  August
    2011, and thereafter he was granted leave  as  a  Tier  1  (Post-Study)
    worker valid until 19th September 2013.  The second, third  and  fourth
    claimants were granted limited leave to remain  as  dependants  of  the
    first claimant.

 4. On 18th September 2013 the first claimant applied for leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the Points-Based  System,  and
    again  the  other  claimants  applied  for  leave  to  remain  as   his
    dependants.

 5. The first claimant's application was refused on 8th October  2013  with
    reference to paragraph 245DD(b) which requires the first claimant to be
    awarded 75 points under  paragraphs  35  to  53  of  Appendix  A.   The
    Secretary of State awarded no points because the first claimant  needed
    to show that he had access to not less than �50,000,  and  provide  the
    specified documents to prove this.

 6. The specified documents  are  set  out  in  paragraph  41-SD(a)(ii)  of
    Appendix A, and the first claimant  had  not  submitted  the  specified
    evidence to prove that the �50,000 was in an account in his  own  name.
    The applications of the  dependants  were  refused  because  the  first
    claimant's application had been refused.

 7. The appeals were heard together by the judge on 8th July 2014, and  the
    judge accepted that prior to the application  the  first  claimant  had
    �50,000 in his personal account, but before making his application  for
    leave to remain, acting on advice from his accountant,  he  transferred
    the funds into a business  account.   Notwithstanding  this  the  judge
    proceeded to allow the appeal under the Immigration  Rules,  commenting
    that having regard to the Secretary of State's policy  of  flexibility,
    the discretion  afforded  by  the  rules  should  have  been  exercised
    differently.

 8. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, noting that the judge accepted that the  first  claimant  did
    not have the required funds in a personal  account  in  his  name,  and
    contending that the judge was wrong to  thereafter  make  reference  to
    evidential flexibility and  allow  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 9. It was contended that this was an unlawful approach and the  judge  had
    misapplied paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules, which  relates  to
    documents not submitted with applications, and it  was  submitted  that
    the judge was wrong to find that the Secretary of State  erred  by  not
    contacting the first claimant for further information or  clarification
    when it was clear at the  time  of  the  application,  that  the  first
    claimant had made a mistake in transferring  funds  from  his  personal
    account to a business account.  The Secretary of State argued that this
    was not a case where paragraph 245AA should have been  applied  by  the
    judge.

10. The Secretary of State was granted permission to appeal  by  Designated
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Shaerf.

Error of Law

11. The  appeal  came  before  me  on  3rd  July  2015  and  after  hearing
    submissions from both parties in relation to error of law, I  concluded
    that the  judge's  decision  must  be  set  aside.   I  set  out  below
    paragraphs 21-30 of my decision dated 10th July 2015, giving my reasons
    for setting aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal;

         21.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is, in  my  view,  not
             clear.  This is demonstrated by the fact that  Mr  Ali  argues
             that the appeal was allowed under paragraph  245DD,  while  Mr
             Smart argues that the  appeal  must  have  been  allowed  with
             reference to paragraph 245AA and evidential flexibility.
         22.  I note that the judge refers to paragraph 245AA  in  paragraph
             21 but in my view this is a typographical error as she records
             that "the refusal was made under the provisions  of  paragraph
             245AA with reference to paragraph 41 and Table 4  of  Appendix
             A."  The refusal was in fact made under paragraph 245DD.   The
             judge goes on in that paragraph to  correctly  remind  herself
             that there is no discretion to be exercised, and if the  first
             claimant does not meet the requirements for  leave  to  remain
             contained in paragraph 245DD the application will be  refused.


         23.  In paragraph  22  the  judge  makes  reference  to  the  first
             claimant and Sponsor giving evidence, but it is clear that she
             must be referring only to the first claimant, and  found  that
             "he did have access  to  funds  as  required  under  paragraph
             245DD(b) with reference to Appendix A  of  the  rules."   This
             conflicts with the concluding sentence  of  the  paragraph  in
             which the judge finds that the first claimant made a  mistake,
             which must refer to the transfer of  funds,  and  he  was  not
             contacted to establish clarification of his position.
         24.  In paragraph  23  the  judge  again  records  that  the  first
             claimant made a genuine mistake, by  transferring  funds  from
             his current account to  his  business  account  prior  to  the
             application for leave to remain.
         25.  In paragraph 24 the judge finds that had  the  first  claimant
             not erred and not transferred the funds from his  personal  to
             his business account, he would have been found to have  access
             to the requisite funds.
         26.  It does therefore appear to be the case that the  judge  found
             that the first claimant did not have the sum of �50,000 in his
             personal account when he made the application.
         27.  The law  as  it  stood  when  the  application  was  made,  is
             helpfully set out in Mr Ali's skeleton argument.  It is common
             ground that the first claimant must demonstrate  that  he  has
             access to not less than �50,000.  He  must  then  provide  the
             specified documents to prove this, and these documents are set
             out in paragraph 41-SD(a)(ii).  One of the requirements at (4)
             is that;


                  The account must be in the applicant's own name  only  (or
                  both names for an entrepreneurial team), not in  the  name
                  of a business or third party;
             The judge found that the first claimant did not  have  �50,000
             in an account in his own name only, but the money  was  in  an
             account held in the name of the first claimant's business  and
             therefore the requirements of paragraph  41-SD(a)(ii)(4)  were
             not  satisfied.   If  the  judge  allowed  the  appeal   under
             paragraph 245DD this was a material error in law.
         28.  If the judge allowed the appeal with  reference  to  paragraph
             245AA then this is also an error  of  law  as  she  failed  to
             explain how paragraph 245AA applied to this application.
         29.  Therefore the decision of the First-tier Tribunal must be  set
             aside.  The findings that the first claimant had  the  sum  of
             �50,000  in  a  personal  account,   which   he   subsequently
             transferred to a business account, were not challenged by  the
             Secretary of State and are therefore preserved.
         30.  When I indicated I was reserving my decision on error of law I
             canvassed the views of the representatives as to whether there
             would be a need for a further hearing.  Mr Ali indicated  that
             the issue of common  law  fairness  had  been  raised  at  the
             hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, and  if  the  decision
             was set aside, he would wish to be given  the  opportunity  to
             make further submissions on that point.  Mr  Ali  acknowledged
             that Article 8 was not pursued before the First-tier Tribunal,
             and he would not be seeking to pursue  Article  8  before  the
             Upper Tribunal.

Re-making the Decision

Preliminary Issues

12. I received from Mr Ali, prior to the  hearing,  his  skeleton  argument
    dated 2nd October 2015.  Mr Smart confirmed  that  he  had  received  a
    copy.

13. I received from Mr Smart at the commencement of the hearing  EK  (Ivory
    Coast) [2014] EWCA Civ 1517, R  on  the  application  of  Baljeet  Kaur
    [2013] EWHC 1538 (Admin), and Alam and Others [2012] EWCA Civ 960.

14. Mr Ali confirmed it was accepted that  the  appeal  could  not  succeed
    under the Immigration Rules or Article 8 of the 1950  ECHR.   The  only
    issue to be decided related to the issue of common law fairness.  If  I
    found that the Secretary of State had not  acted  fairly,  then  I  was
    invited to find that the decision was not in accordance with  the  law,
    and would remain outstanding before the Secretary of State.

15. Both representatives indicated that they  were  ready  to  proceed  and
    there was no application for an adjournment.  Mr Ali confirmed that  no
    further evidence would be called.

The Secretary of State's Submissions

16. Mr Smart submitted that the appeal should be  dismissed  and  noted  Mr
    Ali's reliance upon Thakur Bangladesh [2011] UKUT 00151  (IAC)  in  his
    skeleton argument.  Mr Smart submitted that  the  issue  considered  in
    Thakur was an issue that was not known to the Appellant but was  within
    the knowledge of the Secretary of State.  That was not the position  in
    this appeal.  I was asked to accept that the  Secretary  of  State  had
    acted fairly, by applying the law and policies in place at the date  of
    application.

17. Mr Smart submitted that the issue in this appeal was the same issue  as
    raised in Ground 4 which is set out in paragraph 24 of Alam  and  which
    is set out below;

         The common law duty  of  fairness  imposed  an  obligation  on  the
         Secretary of State to contact an applicant in the  position  of  Mr
         Alam when specified documents were missing  from  his  application,
         and to give him an opportunity  to  rectify  the  omission,  before
         reaching a decision on his application.

18. Mr Smart contended that this ground  was  dismissed  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in paragraphs 43-45 of Alam.

19. In addition, Mr Smart relied upon paragraphs 40,  56-59  of  EK  (Ivory
    Coast) and paragraphs 21, 23, 24, 31, 34 and 42 of Baljeet Kaur.  I was
    asked to conclude that the  case  law  referred  to,  proved  that  the
    Secretary of State was under no duty to contact the first  claimant  in
    this case, to give him an opportunity to  rectify  the  defect  in  his
    application.

The Claimants' Submissions

20. Mr Ali relied upon his skeleton argument.  It was accepted that at  the
    time of application the required funds were not in the first claimant's
    personal account, but it was clear that he had made a  genuine  mistake
    in  transferring  the  funds  into  his  business  account,  and   bank
    statements for both accounts were submitted.  The money in the business
    account had not been  used.   When  the  first  claimant  realised  his
    mistake, after his application was refused, the money  was  transferred
    back into his personal account.

21. It was argued  that  in  material  or  practical  terms  there  was  no
    difference as to whether the funds were held in  the  first  claimant's
    personal or business account, because he had access  to  the  funds  in
    both accounts, and he was the sole  director  and  shareholder  of  his
    business.  It was submitted that the Secretary  of  State  should  have
    exercised her residual discretion and accepted that the first  claimant
    had demonstrated possession of the relevant funds,  albeit  held  in  a
    business account, or alternatively  should  have  contacted  the  first
    claimant to clarify the position, and/or allow him the  opportunity  to
    rectify the mistake by transferring the funds back  into  his  personal
    account before his application was decided.  I was therefore  asked  to
    find that the Secretary of State had not  acted  fairly,  and  on  that
    basis the decision was not in accordance with law.

22. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

23. It is accepted on behalf of the claimants, and I find as a  fact,  that
    the appeals cannot succeed under the Immigration Rules.  The appeals of
    the second, third and fourth claimants depend upon that  of  the  first
    claimant, and his appeal cannot succeed  under  the  Immigration  Rules
    because the Secretary of State was correct not to award him  75  points
    under paragraph 245DD(b) of the Immigration Rules.  This is because  he
    did not have �50,000 in an account in his own name.

24.  It was confirmed by Mr Ali that no reliance was placed upon  paragraph
    245AA of the Immigration Rules,  which  relates  to  documentation  not
    submitted  with  an  application,  and  no  reliance  was  placed  upon
    paragraphs A-F of Appendix FM-SE, which contains similar provisions  to
    paragraph 245AA.  It was also confirmed that  no  reliance  was  placed
    upon paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules in relation  to  private
    life, nor on Article 8 outside the rules.

25. The issue to be decided is that of common law fairness.  The  issue  is
    whether the Secretary of State should either have  accepted  the  first
    claimant did have access to �50,000 albeit not in  an  account  in  his
    name, or should have contacted him to let him amend his application  by
    arranging for �50,000 to be placed in an account in  his  name,  rather
    than in a business account.

26. I find paragraph 9 of Alam to be relevant and set it out below;

         9.   Part 6A of the Immigration Rules contains the PBS,  which  was
             introduced in November 2008. The PBS is based upon an approach
             that decisions on entitlement to enter and remain  in  the  UK
             should  be  taken  by  reference  to  objectively   verifiable
             criteria.  Points are allocated to the relevant criteria, e.g.
             "Attributes",  and  "Maintenance  (Funds)",  and  whether  the
             application is granted or refused is determined by the overall
             points  score.   The  PBS  is   very   detailed   and   highly
             prescriptive.  An important feature of  the  PBS  is  that  it
             specifies  the  evidence  that  must  be  produced  with   the
             application in order to demonstrate that the criteria are met.



27. I find that the issue in this appeal is similar to Ground  4  which  is
    set out in paragraph 24 of Alam and the Court of Appeal dealt with that
    ground in paragraph 45 which I set out below;

         In these three appeals there was no change of  position  after  the
         applications were submitted, the Appellants were simply at fault in
         not supplying the specified documents with their  applications.   I
         endorse the  view  expressed  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Shahzad
         (paragraph 49) that there is no unfairness in  the  requirement  in
         the PBS that an applicant must submit with his application  all  of
         the evidence necessary to  demonstrate  compliance  with  the  rule
         under which he seeks leave.   The  Immigration  Rules,  the  Policy
         Guidance and the prescribed application form all make it clear that
         the prescribed documents must be submitted  with  the  application,
         and if they are not the application will be rejected.  The price of
         securing consistency and predictability is a  lack  of  flexibility
         that may well result in "hard" decisions in individual  cases,  but
         that is not a justification  for  imposing  an  obligation  on  the
         Secretary  of  State  to  conduct  a  preliminary  check   of   all
         applications to see whether they are  accompanied  by  all  of  the
         specified documents, to contact applicants where this  is  not  the
         case, and to  give  them  an  opportunity  to  supply  the  missing
         documents.  Imposing  such  an  obligation  would  not  only   have
         significant resource implications, it would also  extend  the  time
         taken by the  decision  making  process,  contrary  to  the  policy
         underlying the introduction of the PBS.

28. In my view the decision in Alam does not assist  the  first  claimant's
    case.   it  is  clear  that  the  application  could  not  satisfy  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, the responsibility for  ensuring
    that  the  application  met  the  rules  was   the   first   claimant's
    responsibility, not that of the Secretary of State.

29. I do not find that the Secretary of State was under  a  duty  to  check
    that the application was in order, and thereafter to point out  defects
    in the application to the first claimant, and give him  an  opportunity
    to amend the application.  Because of that, I  do  not  find  that  the
    Secretary of State acted unfairly or breached the common  law  duty  of
    fairness.

30. The appeals of the claimants must be dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  on
a point of law and is set aside.  I substitute a fresh decision.

The appeals of the claimants are dismissed.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made no anonymity  direction.   There  has  been  no
application for anonymity to the Upper Tribunal and no  anonymity  order  is
made.
