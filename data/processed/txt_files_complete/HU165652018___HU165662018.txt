Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr J Fraczyk, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants have been granted permission to appeal the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  Just  dismissing  the  appeals  against  the
    decision of the respondent made on 4 July 2018  to  refuse  them  entry
    clearance to join the sponsor Mr Xia Ming Wong, the husband and  father
    in the United  Kingdom  for  settlement.  The  judge  wrongly  said  in
    paragraph 1 that they had been refused leave to remain.

2.   The appellants are mother and son  and  are  citizens  of  China.   The
    first appellant, the mother, was born on 6 December 1975.   The  second
    appellant, her son, was born on 19 December 1999.

3.   The respondent refused the application because the appellants  did  not
    meet all  the  eligibility  "relationship  requirements",  because  the
    second appellant was not under the age of 18  years  when  he  applied.
    Secondly the "financial requirement" was also not satisfied.   A  gross
    income of �22,400 was needed.   The  respondent  could  not  take  into
    account potential employment.  The sponsor in the UK was  using  income
    from  self-employment  to  meet  the   financial   requirement.     The
    respondent said that the account statements did not  show  this.   This
    was because there were inadequacies in (1) the  annual  assessment  tax
    return to HMRC; (2) bank statements, the requisite twelve month period;
    (3) personal bank statements for the same twelve month  period  as  the
    tax return showing that the income from self-employment has  been  paid
    into the account in the name  of  the  person  concerned  and  for  the
    provision of audited accounts. Finally, the respondent  took  the  view
    that there were no exceptional circumstances.

4.   The judge found that the appellants had not discharged  the  burden  of
    proof upon them.  He found that the sponsor was not a credible witness.
     From stating that there was no design or "plan" to his wife  divorcing
    him and then promptly remarrying him again in 2012 (not 2020 as  stated
    by the judge) as soon as he had acquired British  citizenship,  to  his
    stating that he was employed in a manner that enabled  him  to  satisfy
    the financial earnings threshold,  the  sponsor  had  been  lacking  in
    credibility.

5.   The judge then gave consideration to the two  issues  before  him.   He
    identified the two issues as, firstly, with respect  to  the  sponsor's
    financial circumstances; and  secondly,  with  respect  to  the  second
    appellant.

6.   With regard to the  second  issue,  the  judge  held  that  the  second
    applellant's application was made in time on 18 December 2017 when  his
    passport was valid.  The reasons for the judge's decision are  set  out
    at paragraph 19.  As the judge's finding has not been challenged,  this
    finding shall stand.

7.   The judge however refused both appeals that is  the  first  and  second
    appellants' appeals on the first ground which was  in  respect  of  the
    sponsor's financial circumstances.  The judge held as follows:

         "18. First, with respect to the Sponsor's financial  circumstances,
             (which Mr Fraczyk correctly identified as one of the two  main
             issues in this appeal) it  is  clear  that  on  a  balance  of
             probabilities, he is not  able  to  show  a  gross  income  of
             �22,400.   The  evidence  shows  that  his   business   ceased
             functioning on 8th May 2016 (see p.136), and it is  not  clear
             what he is doing now.  I am  not  satisified  that  he  is  an
             employee of the company.  There is no evidence of  this.   The
             Accounts of 4th June 2018 are not signed off  by  'Chew',  the
             Chartered Accountant (at p.137).  At the Hearing  the  Sponsor
             was unable to explain why  that  was  the  case.   Mr  Fraczyk
             states in his well-compiled Skeleton Argument  that  I  should
             "attach weight to the witness statements,  including  that  of
             Mr. Xia Wong" (Skele at para 11).  He draws attention  to  the
             Self-Assessment Annual Tax Return, and the 12-months  of  Bank
             Statements  both  for  the  Business  and  for  the   Personal
             Accounts.  He also referred to the Audited Accounts.  I am not
             satisfied, however, that these documents can be  relied  upon.
             The Appellant's business ceased functioning on  8th  may  2016
             and the Accounts that Mr Fraczyk would have me rely  upon  are
             unsigned by the Accountant.  He, in the alternative,  however,
             argues (Skele at para 12) that the appeal  should  be  allowed
             'outside  the  rules'  on  the  basis   that   the   financial
             requirements are shown to have been satisfied as a  matter  of
             fact.  I am not satisfied that  this  is  the  case.   In  any
             event, the argument that because "the issue of  compliance  in
             this case is with the technical,  evidential  requirements  of
             Appendix FM-SE rather than with any concern that  the  Sponsor
             is not actually earning the required amount" (Skele, para  12)
             does not hold because (i) compliance with  the  Rules  is  the
             starting point, and (ii) as a question  of  fact  the  Sponsor
             cannot show that he is earning what he claims to  be  earning.
             The Sponsor's WS (at para 13.1) refers to his  earnings  going
             up as high as �27,440, but  the  Refusal  Letter  had  already
             explained that the Bank Statements from his  business  account
             with  the  TSB  only  cover  the  period  from  30/03/2016  to
             09/12/2016 and  then  to  30/10/10/2017.   The  Personal  Bank
             Statements  only  covers  the  period   from   14/09/2017   to
             02/02/2017".

8.   The judge then considered the Article 8 claims of  the  appellants  and
    considered  whether  there  are  exceptional  circumstances   to   both
    appellants' claim.  The judge said that if the sponsor  does  not  have
    the requisite earnings in a manner that complies with  the  Immigration
    Rules, then the appellants obviously do not succeed inside the Rules.

9.   The judge questioned whether they  could  succeed  outside  the  Rules.
    The judge was not satisfied on a  balance  of  probabilities  that  the
    appellant has been able to show that when everything else is taken into
    account, the documents within the bundle demonstrate that  the  sponsor
    was in fact earning an amount that is comfortably in excess of what  is
    required.   The  judge   found   that   there   were   no   exceptional
    circumstances, relying on the decision in Agyarko [2017] UKSC  1.   The
    judge was not satisfied that the appellants have discharged the  burden
    of proof upon them because it  would  not  be  unjustifiably  harsh  to
    expect them to apply again.  The judge was not satisfied that there was
    any disproportionality to this course of action if the sponsor has  not
    been able to show the requisite earnings. Section  117B  expresses  the
    public interest in immigration control and the judge was not  satisfied
    that it should not be given the  weight  as  a  consideration  that  is
    intended for it.  Accordingly, he dismissed the appeal.

10.  Mr Fraczyk submitted that the relevant financial year was 1 April  2016
    to 31 March 2017.  He relied on his ground  1  which  argued  that  the
    judge's approach at paragraph 17 in assessing credibility was an  error
    of law.  He submitted that the judge said the sponsor was not credible,
    from stating that there was no design or "plan" to his  wife  divorcing
    him and then promptly remarrying him again as soon as he  had  acquired
    British citizenship, to his stating that he was employed  in  a  manner
    that enabled him to  satisfy  the  financial  earnings  threshold.   Mr
    Fraczyk argued that he could not see how this finding  was  sustainable
    in the absence of a link between the sponsor's marital design  or  plan
    and his financial circumstances.  Mr Fraczyk submitted  that  the  oral
    evidence indicated that the appellant met the minimum requirement.

11.  The evidence that led the judge to link the two issues is to  be  found
    at paragraph 13.  The judge  recorded  that  in  cross-examination  the
    sponsor was asked why he was using a different identity in  the  UK  to
    what he had in China.  He replied that he was attempting to avoid being
    persecuted by the  Chinese  authorities.   He  confirmed  that  he  had
    returned to China four times and had never been arrested.  He was asked
    about his wife divorcing him in 2012, but then went on to  remarry  him
    promptly again in 2012, once he had procured British  citizenship.   He
    was asked whether this was a plan "between the two of them" and he said
    it was not, despite being asked the same question twice.

12.  Mr Whitwell submitted that the issue about the  sponsor's  divorce  and
    the evidence on this point was not disputed.   The  appellant  divorced
    the sponsor and then remarried him which was what the  judge  commented
    on.

13.  I accept that the judge commented  on  the  account  of  the  sponsor's
    marriage to the appellant.  It was not clear from paragraph 17  whether
    the judge was  stating  that  the  sponsor  was  not  credible  in  his
    assertion that there was no design or plan to his  wife  divorcing  him
    and then promptly remarrying him again  in  2012  as  soon  as  he  had
    acquired British citizenship.  If the judge was separating  this  issue
    out and making an adverse credibility finding on it, he failed to  give
    reasons for the  adverse  credibility  finding  if  that  was  what  he
    intended to do.   In the absence of a clear finding on this  matter,  I
    accept Mr Fraczyk's submission that  there  was  no  link  between  the
    sponsor's  marital  circumstances  and  his  ability  to  satisfy   the
    financial  earnings  threshold.    The  design  or  plan  to  his  wife
    divorcing him and then remarrying him again bore no  relevance  to  the
    sponsor's financial circumstances and his ability to meet the financial
    earnings threshold for the relevant tax year of  1  April  2016  to  31
    March 2017.

14.  Turning now to the sponsor's ability to satisfy the financial  earnings
    threshold, Mr Fraczyk submitted that  the  appeal  can  be  allowed  on
    matters of fact even if he does not  comply  with  the  strict  minimum
    requirement.

15.  Mr  Fraczyk  submitted  that  the  only  reasons  the  judge  gave  for
    rejecting the documents were at paragraph 18.  The judge held that  the
    evidence shows that the sponsor's business ceased functioning on 8  May
    2016.  Mr Fraczyk said this was incorrect because at page  136  of  the
    appellant's  bundle  was  a  director's  report  from  the  appellant's
    chartered accountant which said the sponsor's company ceased trading on
    8 May 2017.  Mr Fraczyk said this was material because May  2017  takes
    us beyond the tax year that is being considered.

16.  Mr Fraczyk accepted the judge's finding that the  accounts  of  4  June
    2018 were not signed off  by  "Chew",  the  Chartered  Accountant.   Mr
    Fraczyk submitted that Appendix FM-SE 7(h)  does  not  expressly  state
    that the accounts should be signed.

17.  Mr Fraczyk submitted that the judge was wrong to find  that  the  self-
    assessment annual tax return, and the twelve months of bank  statements
    both for the business and for the personal  accounts  and  the  audited
    accounts could not be relied upon.  Mr Fraczyk said  that  he  accepted
    that from the point of view of the Immigration Rules that  would  be  a
    starting point but not the end point.

18.  Mr Fraczyk said the judge was  then  left  with  the  bank  statements.
    Within the appellant's appeal statement, he  indicated  that  the  bank
    account covered the whole of the financial year.

19.  Mr Fraczyk relied on the grant of permission which said that there  was
    no suggestion that the documents were not genuine. Mr Fraczyk  referred
    to the tax returns in the appellant's bundle of documents at pages  266
    to 269.  At page 268 was the tax return for  the  tax  year  2016-2017.
    The total income  on  which  tax  was  due  was  �27,440.   Mr  Fraczyk
    submitted that even if Appendix FM-SE  is  not  satisfied  because  the
    accounts were not signed, the appeal can still be allowed  because  the
    appellants meet the minimum income requirement.  Mr  Fraczyk  submitted
    that if the judge had taken this evidence into account  he  would  have
    found that the minimum income requirement was satisfied in any event.

20.  Mr Whitwell took issue with the  sponsor's  claim  that  he  meets  the
    minimum income requirement.  Mr Whitwell referred to Phelan page  1325,
    Appendix FM-SE 7(h)(i)(bb) which states that the appellant must submit,
    if the business is not required to produce  audited  accounts  for  the
    last full financial year, an Accountant's Certificate of  Confirmation,
    from an accountant who is a member of a UK recognised supervisory body.
     Mr Whitwell submitted that the accounts were not signed and  therefore
    there was no certification of confirmation  from  the  accountant.   He
    submitted that failure to sign the accounts means that  the  appellants
    cannot succeed under Appendix FMSE which is why Mr  Fraczyk  needed  to
    take the court through the accounts to say that the sponsor met  it  in
    terms of the amount.   Mr  Whitwell  submitted  that  the  respondent's
    position is that there is  no  signed  certificate.    The  appellants'
    position seems to be that even if the accounts are not signed, it  does
    not mean that the accounts are not genuine.

21.  Mr Whitwell submitted that  the  self-assessment  tax  calculations  at
    pages 266 to 269 were printed on the same day and  at  the  same  time.
    There was no evidence that the sponsor has paid the tax stated  in  the
    tax return.  He added that the judge held further that he did not  know
    what the sponsor was doing now.

22.  Mr Fraczyk in his reply said there was no reasoning why the  judge  was
    not satisfied that the sponsor did not meet  the  financial  threshold.
    He submitted that the appellant adopted his witness  statement  at  the
    hearing below.  There was no Record of Proceedings on  the  appellant's
    file.   At  paragraph  13  of  the  sponsor's  witness  statement,   he
    identified the financial documents which he had submitted to show  that
    he satisfied the minimum income  requirement.   He  accepted  that  the
    accounts were not signed but submitted that this was the starting point
    and should not have been the end point of the judge's analysis.  As  to
    the documents being printed on  the  same  day,  Mr  Fraczyk  said  the
    sponsor was not asked about it.  It  was  just  an  observation  by  Mr
    Whitwell.  It would be a matter of oral evidence.  He further submitted
    that the typographical errors in the judge's decision  did  not  change
    the fundamental point that the sponsor's business was  trading  in  the
    relevant financial year.  Mr Fraczyk submitted that the appeal  can  be
    allowed outside the Immigration Rules if  the  material  is  looked  at
    properly.

23.  I find that the judge's  errors,  namely,  (1)  that  the  respondent's
    decision was a refusal to grant leave to remain; (2) the sponsor's wife
    remarried him again in 2020 instead of 2012; (3) the sponsor's business
    ceased functioning on 8 May 2016 when in  fact  it  ceased  trading  in
    2017, do not materially affect the judge's decision.

24.  I also find that Mr Whitwell's submission that the financial  documents
    were printed on the same day and at the same  time  was  not  something
    that I could consider since it was a matter that required oral evidence
    and the proceedings today would not have been  the  suitable  venue  to
    look at this submission which appeared  to  be  an  observation  by  Mr
    Whitwell.

25.  The issue before me  is  whether  the  sponsor  satisfied  the  minimum
    income requirement for the financial year 1  April  2016  to  31  March
    2017.  On the evidence drawn to my attention by  Mr  Fraczyk  I  accept
    that the tax return for that year does show that  the  sponsor  had  an
    income of �27,400 which was in excess of the �22,400 and satisfied  the
    minimum income requirement.  I find that had the judge  considered  the
    documents  properly  he  would  have  found  that  the  minimum  income
    requirement was satisfied.

26.  However, that was  not  the  end  point.   Appendix  FM-SE  7(h)(i)(bb)
    states  that  the  sponsor/appellant   must  "produce  an  accountant's
    certificate  of  confirmation".   The  judge  rightly  noted  that  the
    accounts had not been signed by the sponsor's accountants.  Mr  Fraczyk
    also accepted this.  In arguing that the appeal can be allowed  outside
    the Rules indicated to me  that  Mr  Fraczyk  was  accepting  that  the
    appellant's appeal  could  not  succeed  under  the  Immigration  Rules
    because of a failure to produce a signed certificate of confirmation of
    the accounts by his accountant.

27.  Mr Fraczyk however submitted that the appeal could be  allowed  outside
    of the Immigration Rules because the  minimum  income  requirement  was
    satisfied.  I find that I do not have a discretion to allow the  appeal
    on the basis suggested by Mr. Fraczyk.

28.  I accept the argument by Mr Fraczyk in his grounds of appeal  that  the
    judge was undoubtedly correct in concluding that the starting point  of
    any consideration of Article 8 outside the Rules  was  compliance  with
    the Immigration Rules.  However, I also accept Mr.  Fraczyk's  argument
    that the judge fell into error in that he also treated this as the  end
    point of his assessment.  I find that the judge's  finding  that  there
    were no exceptional circumstances was based on  the  inability  of  the
    appellants to meet the Rules (paragraph 20) as was his finding that  it
    would not be unjustifiably harsh to expect them to apply again as there
    is no disproportionality to this course of action if  the  sponsor  has
    not been able to show the requisite earnings (paragraph 22).

29.  I find nevertheless that the error is not  material.    The  appellants
    do not  comply  with  the  Immigration  Rules  in  the  absence  of  an
    Accountant's Certificate of Confirmation.  The sponsor's company ceased
    trading on 8 May 2017.  The judge held that it was not  clear  what  he
    was doing now.  The judge was not satisfied that  the  sponsor  was  an
    employee of the company in the absence of evidence of  this.  I  accept
    that the first appellant and the sponsor re-married in 2012.  They have
    a son who is an adult.  I find that the  facts  in  this  case  do  not
    disclose any exceptional circumstances.  Relying on Agyarko [2017] UKSC
    1, I find that maintaining the respondent's decision would not lead  to
    unjustifiably harsh consequences for the appellants.

30.  Accordingly, I uphold the judge's decision.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
