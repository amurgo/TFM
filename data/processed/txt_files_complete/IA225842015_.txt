Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Mahmood, Counsel, instructed by Justmount & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs H Aboni, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of India of Sikh ethnic origin.  My task  in
    this case is to re-make the decision on the appellant's appeal  against
    a decision made by the respondent in 2015 refusing him settlement as  a
    partner of a person present and settled in the UK.  His original appeal
    against this decision had been dismissed by First-tier  Tribunal  (FtT)
    Judge Graham on 9 March 2016.  That dismissal was set  aside  by  Upper
    Tribunal  Judge  Chalkley  in  an  "error  of  law"  decision  sent  on
    15 February 2017.  Judge Chalkley found that the judge  had  erred  in
    failing to afford the appellant the opportunity of addressing  evidence
    to establish that he is the father of his partner's two children.  This
    failure wrongly led the judge  to  fail  to  consider  the  appellant's
    family and private life circumstances in the United Kingdom.

2.   At the hearing Mr Mahmood  pointed  out  that  the  appellant  had  now
    produced DNA evidence establishing paternity.  He  submitted  that  the
    testing had been carried out in accordance with established procedures.
     Mrs Aboni said that there were discrepancies in the consent  form  and
    that she did not accept  that  the  DNA  tests  had  been  carried  out
    properly.  She added that if however paternity was established she  was
    prepared to accept the description  of  family  life  set  out  in  the
    appellant's witness statement.  After discussion  with  the  parties  I
    stated that I would proceed to hear the  parties'  submissions  on  the
    provisional basis that the appellant had established paternity and  for
    that reason would treat the account of  family  life  set  out  in  the
    witness statement as agreed.

3.   I would only revisit  this  provisional  assessment  if  the  appellant
    failed to send to the Tribunal and the parties a letter  from  the  DNA
    testing body, producing the photograph of the man who provided the  DNA
    sample to the nurse.  That would enable a quick check to be made as  to
    whether that photo was indeed a photo of the appellant.

4.   On the above basis Mr Mahmood's submission to  me  was  that  I  should
    find that the appellant and his partner and family  could  relocate  to
    either Afghanistan or Pakistan.  As regards Afghanistan, he  emphasised
    that she had fled that country due to the armed conflict;  it  was  not
    reasonable to expect her and her family to relocate there.  As  regards
    India, the appellant's wife and children would  have  to  apply  for  a
    spouse/dependant visa and  it  was  uncertain  whether  they  would  be
    granted one.  The appellant's wife had never travelled to  India.   The
    appellant's children were born in the UK (in July 2012 and August 2014)
    and even though neither has resided in the UK  for  seven  years,  they
    have never been abroad.  The appellant has no house, no land, he  would
    be starting from scratch  having  to  provide  for  his  wife  and  two
    children.  In 2018 the appellant's wife could be granted ILR but it was
    not realistic she could meet all the requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules as she is on welfare and has medical difficulties.  On return she
    would face the same difficulties in being unable to meet the  financial
    requirements  of  the  Rules.   Separation  from  his  wife  would   be
    disproportionate.

5.   Mrs Aboni said that it was unclear  why  the  appellant's  partner  had
    been granted DL but it was  most  likely  legacy  considerations.   Her
    claim for asylum vis-ï¿½-vis Afghanistan had not been accepted.  Her only
    reasons for not wanting to go back to India were economic.   Mrs  Aboni
    asked me to conclude that the appellant did not meet  the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rule and that in assessing the appellant's situation
    outside the Rules I should attach adverse weight to the  fact  that  he
    had established his  family  and  private  life  at  a  time  when  his
    immigration status was precarious.  The best interests of the  children
    lay with their continuing to live with their parents in Afghanistan  or
    India.  There was no reason they could not adapt to life in India.  The
    children were not British citizens and did not have settled status.

My Assessment

6.   In assessing this case I take account of all  the  evidence,  including
    the recent witness statements of the appellant and his wife  and  their
    friends.  It is  clear  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  several
    relevant requirements of the Immigration Rule.  His wife did  not  have
    settled status; his application failed to submit evidence to  show  the
    couple had lived together for two years.  He had insufficient residence
    to qualify under paragraph 276ADE.  He had  failed  to  establish  that
    there would be very significant obstacles  to  his  reintegration  into
    Indian society. The children were not  British  citizens  and  had  not
    resided in the UK for seven years.   Accordingly  the  appellant  could
    only succeed if able to show that there were  compelling  circumstances
    outside the Rules warranting a grant of leave to remain  on  Article  8
    grounds.

7.   I accept that the appellant has established he  has  family  life  ties
    with his partner and their two children.  I  also  accept  that  having
    lived in the UK for over fourteen years he has established  links  with
    the UK.  However, I do not consider,  however,  that  the  respondent's
    refusal of leave to remain was disproportionate.

8.   As regards the appellant's likely circumstances in India, it  is  clear
    from the evidence that he has family there and that  he  has  links  of
    culture, language and tradition with that country.  Even if  he  cannot
    turn to close family members for support, it is  reasonably  likely  he
    will be able to find employment.  Whilst he has resided in the UK since
    either 2002 or 2002 he has never had valid leave to remain and all  his
    private and family life ties have  been  formed  at  a  time  when  his
    immigration status was precarious.

9.   As regards the appellant's partner, I am prepared to  accept  that  she
    and the appellant  have  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  and
    (despite lack  of  requisite  evidence  under  the  Rules)  have  lived
    together for two years.  However, she is not a  British  citizen  or  a
    person present or settled in the UK.  Unless  of  her  own  choice  she
    decides to remain in the UK for as long as she has DL, it is reasonably
    open to her to accompany the appellant to India, taking their  children
    with them.  Whether or not she is able to return to Afghanistan,  I  am
    satisfied that there are no insurmountable obstacles to her  relocating
    with the appellant in India.  She is not a national of India but it  is
    probable she will be able to obtain entry and  be  able  to  reside  in
    India on the basis that she  is  the  spouse  of  an  Indian  national.
    Although she is a national of Afghanistan, she is of Sikh ethnic origin
    and India contains the highest indigenous settlement of persons of Sikh
    ethnic origin in the world.  She (like her two children) has  DL  until
    18 February  2018  but  it  remains  that  her  relationship  with  the
    appellant was commenced when her  immigration  status  was  precarious.
    She suffers from persistent back and leg pain, but she will have access
    to medical treatment in India.

10.  I take into account that the appellant has two children who have  lived
    all their lives in the UK, having been born in  July  2012  and  August
    2014 respectively.  Like their mother,  they  have  DL  until  February
    2018.  However neither has lived in the UK for seven years and  neither
    is a British citizen or a person with settled status.  I consider  that
    in their case their best interests lie primarily with their parents and
    being able to remain living with them as a family unit.   The  evidence
    does not establish that they have formed very significant ties  outside
    their immediate family.  It is not suggested that they have been raised
    with no awareness of and exposure to Sikh culture and traditions.

11.    Earlier I noted that I would  proceed  to  decide  the  case  on  the
    provisional basis that the appellant has established paternity  of  the
    children concerned. At the date of finalising my  decision,  I  am  not
    aware of  any  response  to  my  directions.  Nevertheless  it  is  not
    necessary for me to reach a firm conclusion on paternity  because  even
    on the assumption that the appellant has established paternity, I  have
    not found that his appeal can succeed.


For the above reasons:

The decision of the FtT judge has already been set aside for material  error
of law.

The decision I re-make is to dismiss the appellant's appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
