                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is appeal has been remitted to the Upper Tribunal by the Court  of
    Appeal in order for a decision to be made  on  whether  the  appellant,
    notwithstanding her criminal conduct, qualifies for  a  residence  card
    showing her to have derivative residence rights as the primary carer of
    an EEA national.

 2. The respondent now  concedes  that  the  appellant's  criminal  conduct
    cannot amount to the level of criminality that can be characterised  as
    the "exceptional circumstances" required to justify her expulsion;  see
    SSHD v CS [2016] EUECJ C-304/14.

   3. The respondent initially proposed to  withdraw  her  case  before  the
      Upper Tribunal by way of ending this matter. The case before the Upper
      Tribunal was brought by the appellant, however,  not  the  respondent.
      The  respondent  has  no  "case"  to  withdraw.  After   a   telephone
      conversation with Mr Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer,  it
      was agreed that the respondent conceded  that  the  appeal  should  be
      allowed.


   4. On that basis, the appeal is allowed under the  Immigration  (European
      Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

Notice of Decision

The appeal  is  allowed  under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006.
