                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Purusottam Gurung, a citizen of Nepal  born  11
       March 1985, against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
       Reid) of 23 August 2018 to dismiss his appeal, itself brought against
       the Respondent's decision of 14 July 2017 to refuse  his  application
       to join his father in the UK as  an  adult  dependent  relative;  the
       decision was treated as the refusal of a human rights application.


  Introduction and application process


    2.  The  Appellant  had  originally   applied   for   entry   clearance,
       unsuccessfully, aged 25, in October  2010.  The  Appellant's  present
       application, made on 4 April 2017, was to join his father Indra Kumar
       Gurung, a former Gurkha, who had come to the UK on  24  October  2009
       having  been  granted  entry  clearance  on  31  August   2009.   The
       Appellant's mother was granted entry clearance on 29  September  2010
       and came to the UK in July 2012, though she  had  habitually  resided
       with the Appellant in Nepal subsequently, returning to the  UK  twice
       for 1-2 months at a time, once to access medical treatment. Mr Gurung
       Senior had been discharged in October 1985, then returning  to  Nepal
       absent any opportunity to settle in the UK.


    3. Normally an adult dependent relative has  to  demonstrate  that  they
       have serious healthcare needs which cannot be  met  abroad,  but  the
       Secretary of State has set out a policy instruction, in the light  of
       lengthy  litigation,  addressing  the  circumstances  of  the  family
       members of Gurkhas, including their  adult  dependents.  However  the
       relatives of Gurkhas benefit from a specific policy designed to cater
       for their needs in the light of the historic injustice  visited  upon
       former Gurkhas who were discharged under a procedure that denied them
       the appropriate opportunity to settle in the UK.

    4. The application was refused because the Respondent took the view that
       the Appellant had been living apart from the Sponsor  for  more  than
       two years, that dependency was not clearly established, that  he  was
       over 30 years of age, and that there were no  exceptional  compelling
       circumstances to override these considerations.  That  reasoning  was
       upheld by an Entry Clearance Manager on 27 February 2018.

    5. The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  the
       refusal,  arguing  that  he  had  applied  at  the  first   available
       opportunity after the policy's amendment in  January  2015,  and  had
       been unable to do so sooner as he had lacked the relevant information
       to make an application (as it had been necessary for  his  father  to
       seek  the  assistance  of  the  Veteran's  Association),   that   his
       dependency on his parents exceeded the normal emotional ties as shown
       by his mother's return to Nepal to reside with him,  and  included  a
       financial element because he had been  unable  to  achieve  financial
       independence because he lacked education, unlike his siblings.

The First-tier Tribunal decision

    6. The Tribunal summarised the Appellant's case, and  made  findings  of
       fact, noting that the Appellant was born shortly  before  his  father
       was discharged, and that he was aged 24 when his father moved to  the
       UK in 2009. When his mother obtained her entry clearance he was  aged
       27. He was unmarried and lived at home with his mother; he was a  man
       of 32, not a young adult.


    7. He had lived without his father in Nepal for around 8 years  and  had
       not seen him since 2009, was physically fit, and save for a reference
       to his being forgetful, no medical evidence was  adduced  as  to  any
       mental health difficulties. He had obtained A levels  notwithstanding
       his claim to have lacked education. He was familiar  with  Nepal  and
       had friends and played sports there. It could be presumed  he  had  a
       social network of friends in the area where he was  settled.  He  was
       fit, well and educated, and so not unemployable, notwithstanding that
       he did not work presently; the Judge expressly  found  that  he  must
       have worked at times, and any financial dependency on the Sponsor was
       thus not of necessity.  He had a good relationship with  his  father,
       being in regular telephone contact, but the Sponsor was  not  closely
       involved in his daily life, and had  not  been  since  2009,  however
       supportive he was generally. It was not suggested that the  Appellant
       could not cope when his mother was absent in the UK.

    8. The First-tier Tribunal found that the Sponsor had been  involved  in
       the push to obtain settlement rights for the children of Gurkhas, and
       so should not have needed to obtain further information by travelling
       to London to gain information from the Veteran's network. Both he and
       his wife had by now made successful applications  under  the  system.
       The Appellant's mother  had  returned  to  the  UK  to  maintain  her
       indefinite leave to remain.

    9. His relationship  with  his  mother  was  not  one  exceeding  normal
       emotional ties absent physical or mental dependency,  and  there  was
       here no financial dependency of necessity.  Nevertheless,  given  the
       evidence that his mother relied on him for support, and in the  light
       of the health issues for which she had been treated,  it  had  to  be
       recognised that he was also needed to look after his parents too.

   10. The Appellant's relationship with the Sponsor  showed  no  dependency
       exceeding the  norm.  Although  the  Appellant's  mother  spent  long
       periods of time apart from her husband, this did  not  show  she  had
       special ties with her son. She  had  presumably  been  free  to  have
       departed Nepal for the UK from 2010 onwards, given that the Appellant
       could look after himself. Based on  these  considerations  the  Judge
       concluded that there was no family life between the Sponsor, his wife
       and the Appellant sufficient to engage Article 8 ECHR.

   11. Assessing the claim in the alternative, the First-tier Tribunal  went
       on to assess proportionality. Having regard to the policy in Annex  K
       to the IDI, the Appellant:

      a) Was over 30 when he applied, over 2 years after the policy was
         announced, a significant period even having regard to the
         associated cost - it seemed that what had changed in the
         intervening period was his parents' realisation that they would
         like the Appellant to be available to support them in their old
         age (9.4);


      b) Was not financially dependent on the Sponsor out of necessity, nor
         emotionally dependent on him (9.5);


      c) Had lived apart from the Sponsor for around 8 years (9.8).

   12. There were numerous factors indicating that the immigration  decision
       was not disproportionate: he did not meet the policy which  enshrined
       the important public interest in ensuring  veterans'  family's  cases
       were addressed fairly and consistently. Had he met  the  criteria  of
       the Annex K policy, that would have counted  in  his  favour  in  the
       assessment of proportionality; but he did not, so could not  rely  on
       that factor. His financial dependency on his father indicated that he
       was not financially independent  which  meant  that  this  particular
       section 117B factor was against him. The public interest  represented
       by section 117B was not  here  overcome  by  the  historic  injustice
       committed against the Gurkhas given the Appellant did not fall within
       the policy. There was no dependency exceeding the norm and he was  in
       good health, his parents could contribute towards his maintenance  if
       required, and he had lived with his mother  without  any  significant
       practical or emotional issues having arisen.

   13. There were factors in the Appellant's favour, such as the  fact  that
       the family's evidence was that he would have settled in  the  UK  had
       that been possible whilst still a dependent minor, that his  original
       application in 2010 had been made before he was 30 and  when  he  had
       not yet lived part from his father for two years, and that his mother
       had been forced to live between the UK and Nepal, all this arising in
       the context that his father had carried out exemplary service for the
       Gurkhas. These did not outbalance the negative factors,  because  the
       historical injustice was tempered by the fact the Appellant  did  not
       apply promptly (Annex K para 9(18)), given  that  family  life  could
       continue in the future as it had done in the past,  with  his  mother
       travelling as she wished.

Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

   14. The grounds of appeal alleged that the decision was flawed because


      a) The approach to family life failed to apply the test of "effective
         and committed support" but rather sought some elevated level of
         necessity;



      b) The family life assessment also failed to take account of the
         impact of the mother's extended presence in Nepal, which showed a
         failure to have regard to the family life that the mother was
         entitled to enjoy with her husband as well as her son, overlooked
         the possibility that her presence in Nepal demonstrated family
         ties exceeding the norm, and discounted the reciprocal ties
         between mother and son;



      c) Proportionality had been mis-assessed: proportionality was a
         matter for the judge assessing the appeal without giving undue
         weight to the Secretary of State's policy scheme, and wrongly
         treated section 117B NIAA 2002 as being relevant, whereas Rai had
         established that those considerations should not count against an
         applicant in a case where the "historic injustice" had force.

   15. The First-tier Tribunal refused permission on  9  October  2018,  but
       permission to appeal was granted by the Upper Tribunal on  7  January
       2019.


  Error of law hearing


   16. At the hearing of 19 February, it was  submitted  for  the  Appellant
       that this was a case  where  family  life  was  clearly  established;
       family life was recognised by the authorities as  being  indivisible,
       and here the mother's circumstances living between two countries  had
       to be carefully factored into the  balance.  There  was  no  elevated
       threshold of "necessity" before family life was engaged. The historic
       injustice was found in the Appellant's inability to apply to join his
       father during his minority, not simply in whether  he  met  the  more
       detailed requirements of Annex K. The assessment as to  the  historic
       wrong should focus on whether the family should now be settled  here:
       it was the inability to settle at the  date  of  discharge  that  was
       relevant,  not  the  inability  at  the  date  that  the  policy  was
       announced. In the event the Upper Tribunal accepted a material  error
       of law had been  committed,  a  re-hearing  would  be  necessary,  as
       further oral evidence was required.

   17. Ms Jones replied that  the  Appellant's  age,  and  the  question  of
       historic injustice, were  clearly  considered  via  clearly  reasoned
       findings. The findings were readily unsustainable.

  Decision and reasons - error of law hearing

   18. Annex K (22 January 2015) addresses Adult Children of Former Gurkhas:

           "Definition of an adult child of a former Gurkha
           2. For the purposes of this policy, an adult child is the son or
           daughter of  a  former  Gurkha.  See  further  guidance  on  the
           relationship to the sponsor in paragraph 11 of Annex K  of  this
           guidance.
           ...
           Settlement for adult children of former Gurkhas
           9. In order for settlement to be granted to the adult child of a
           former Gurkha under this policy, a valid application  for  entry
           clearance must be made in accordance with  paragraphs  24-30  of
           the Immigration Rules and the Appellant will  normally  have  to
           meet the following conditions:
                1. The former Gurkha parent has been, or is in  the  process
                of being granted settlement  under  the  2009  discretionary
                arrangements; and
                2. The Appellant is  the  son  or  daughter  of  the  former
                Gurkha; and
                3. The Appellant is outside the UK; and
                4. The Appellant is 18 years of age or over and 30 years  of
                age  or  under  on  the  date  of   application   (including
                Appellants who are 30 as at the date of application); and
                5. The Appellant is financially and emotionally dependent on
                the former Gurkha; and
                6. The Appellant was under 18 years of age at  the  time  of
                the former Gurkha's discharge; (or if the Appellant was born
                after discharge see guidance in paragraph 16 of Annex  K  of
                this guidance) and
                7. The Secretary of State is satisfied that  an  application
                for settlement by the former Gurkha  would  have  been  made
                before 2009 had the option to do so been available before  1
                July 1997; and
                8. The Appellant has not been living apart from  the  former
                Gurkha for more than two years on the date  of  application,
                and has never lived apart from the sponsor for more than two
                years at a time, unless this was by reason of  education  or
                something similar (such that the family unit was maintained,
                albeit the Appellant lived away); and
                9. The Appellant has not formed an independent family  unit;
                and
                10. The Appellant does not fall to be refused on grounds  of
                suitability under paragraph 8 or 9 of Appendix Armed  Forces
                to the Immigration Rules or those provisions of  Part  9  of
                the Immigration Rules (general  grounds  for  refusal)  that
                apply in respect of applications made under  Appendix  Armed
                Forces.
           Financial and emotional dependency on former Gurkha
           15. The Appellant must be financially and emotionally  dependent
           on the former Gurkha sponsor. Evidence of  financial  dependency
           may include the fact that the Appellant has not been  supporting
           him or herself and working but has been  financially  supported,
           out of necessity by his or her former Gurkha  sponsor,  who  has
           sent money regularly from the UK.
           Age at time of former Gurkha's discharge
           16. The Appellant must have been under 18 years of  age  at  the
           time of the former Gurkha's discharge. If this age condition  is
           not met, the application must be refused under  this  policy  on
           this basis. Please note that  an  adult  child  born  after  the
           sponsor's discharge will qualify under this policy if all  other
           conditions are met.
           Historical Injustice
           17. In order to qualify for settlement  under  this  policy  the
           Home Office needs to be satisfied that the former  Gurkha  would
           have applied to  settle  in  the  UK  upon  discharge  with  the
           dependent child if they had been born by then (but otherwise the
           child would have been born here). If a sponsor  states  that  he
           intended to settle in the UK on discharge, then, in the  absence
           of any countervailing evidence, this requirement  will  normally
           be considered to have been met.
           18. Examples of countervailing evidence might include situations
           where:
                - the sponsor did not apply promptly when the  discretionary
                police was announced; or
                - the sponsor has a history of dishonesty;
                - the former Gurkha did not return to his family in Nepal on
                discharge (eg because he went to work elsewhere).
           If the decision maker does not feel  that  this  requirement  is
           satisfied and they have referred the matter to a senior decision
           maker, they should normally propose refusal of  the  application
           on this ground.
           Living Apart
           19. The Appellant must not normally have lived  apart  from  the
           Gurkha  sponsor  for  more  than  two  years  on  the  date   of
           application  or  at  any  time,  unless  the  family  unit   was
           maintained albeit the Appellant lived  away,  for  example  time
           spent at boarding school, college or university as part of their
           full-time education where the Appellant lived at  university  or
           college during term time but resided in the family  home  during
           holidays. If these conditions are not met the  application  must
           be refused under this policy on this basis.
           Living Independently
           20. The application must also be refused  if  the  Appellant  is
           living independently in a different family  unit  (for  example,
           the Appellant is living with  relatives  who  are  acting  in  a
           parental capacity), or where the Appellant has formed their  own
           independent family unit by getting married or  entering  into  a
           civil partnership  or  a  relationship  akin  to  marriage/civil
           partnership."

   19. This guidance provides the context within which an Article 8 claim is
       to be assessed. The  extent  to  which  an  Appellant  satisfies  the
       relevant publicly expressed policy requirements  is  highly  relevant
       when assessing proportionality. As stated by Richards LJ in Tozlukaya
       [2006] EWCA Civ 379 (and applied in AG Kosovo [2007] UKAIT 00082):


         "If a policy tells in favour of the person concerned being  allowed
         to stay in this country, it may affect the  balance  under  article
         8(2) and provide a proper basis for a finding that the case  is  an
         exceptional one."


   20. This principle remains relevant under the system of Immigration Rules
       expressly addressing family life. In SS (Congo) & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ
       387, it was said that  "it  is  accurate  to  say  that  the  general
       position ... is  that  compelling  circumstances  would  need  to  be
       identified to support a claim  for  grant  of  LTR  outside  the  new
       Rules". At �48 the Court goes on:


           "What does matter, however -  whether  one  is  dealing  with  a
           section of the Rules which constitutes a "complete code" (as  in
           MF (Nigeria)) or with a section of the  Rules  which  is  not  a
           "complete code" (as in Nagre and the present appeals)  -  is  to
           identify, for the purposes of  application  of  Article  8,  the
           degree of weight to be attached  to  the  expression  of  public
           policy in the substantive part of the Rules  in  the  particular
           context in question (which will not always be  the  same:  hence
           the guidance we seek to give in this judgment), as well  as  the
           other factors relevant to the Article 8  balancing  exercise  in
           the particular case (which, again, may well vary from context to
           context and from case to case)."


   21. Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  decision  in  SS  (Congo)  was
       overturned by the Supreme Court  in  MM  (Lebanon)  [2017]  UKSC  10,
       therein Lady Hale and Lord Carnwath confirm  this  reasoning  remains
       extant �77: "Instructions ...  have to be taken into account as  part
       of the overall scheme: on the one hand, they might  so  mitigate  the
       effects of the Rules as to make them compatible with  the  Convention
       rights when they would not otherwise have been so".  Accordingly  the
       extent to  which  the  Appellant  satisfied  the  policy  imperatives
       expressed  by  Annex  K   was   relevant   to   the   assessment   of
       proportionality. However, the case law on historic injustice  visited
       upon the Gurkhas also demonstrate that the Annex K policy  represents
       the starting point for an application's  assessment,  and  is  not  a
       complete answer to it.


  Family life


   22. Lord Bingham stated in Huang [2007] UKHL 11 at �24:

           "Human beings are social animals. They depend on  others.  Their
           family, or extended family, is the group on  which  many  people
           most   heavily   depend,   socially,   emotionally   and   often
           financially. There comes a point at which, for  some,  prolonged
           and unavoidable separation from this  group  seriously  inhibits
           their ability to live full and fulfilling lives. Matters such as
           the  age,  health  and  vulnerability  of  the  applicant,   the
           closeness and previous history of the  family,  the  applicant's
           dependence on the financial and emotional support of the family,
           the prevailing cultural tradition and conditions in the  country
           of origin and many other factors may all be relevant."


   23. The decision of the Strasbourg Court in Advic v UK (1995) 20 EHRR  CD
       125 is sometimes cited for the proposition that the normal  emotional
       ties between a parent and an adult son or daughter will not,  without
       more, be enough: Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31. As shown by the  useful
       review of the authorities in Ghising  [2012] UKUT 00160, this is  not
       the whole picture,  however,  and  as  Buxton  LJ  emphasised  in  MT
       (Zimbabwe) [2007] EWCA Civ 455 at [11] Advic, "whilst  stressing  the
       need for an element of dependency over and above the  normal  between
       that of a parent or parent figure and adult child, also stresses that
       everything depends on the circumstances  of  each  case".  The  Upper
       Tribunal President wrote in Lama [2017] UKUT 16 (IAC)  �32  that  "at
       its heart, family life denotes real  or  committed  personal  support
       between or among the persons concerned."


   24. In AA v United Kingdom (Application no 8000/08;  20  September  2011)
       the European Court of Human Rights stated that:

           "An examination of the Court's case-law would tend to suggest
           that the applicant, a young adult of 24 years old, who resides
           with his mother and has not yet founded a family of his own, can
           be regarded as having 'family life'."

   25. Scott Baker LJ in HK (Turkey) [2010] EWCA Civ 583 at [16]:

           "Normal emotional ties will exist between an adult child and his
           parent or other members of his family regardless of proximity
           and where they live. Scrutinising the relevant facts, as one is
           obliged to do, it is apparent that the respondent had lived in
           the same house as his parents since 1994. He reached his
           majority in September 2005 but continued to live at home.
           Undoubtedly he had family life while he was growing up and I
           would not regard it as suddenly cut off when he reached his
           majority."

   26. The courts have given guidance on assessing the existence  of  family
       life where the separation of the parties has been  exacerbated  by  a
       "historic injustice". In Patel [2010] EWCA Civ 17, Sedley  LJ  stated
       at [14] that "what may constitute an extant family  life  falls  well
       short of what constitutes dependency, and a good many adult  children
       ... may still have a family life with parents  who  are  now  settled
       here not by leave or by force of  circumstance  but  by  long-delayed
       right". In Rai [2017] EWCA Civ 320 at  [36]-[37]  Lindblom  LJ  found
       that the Upper Tribunal had erred in law in assessing  the  existence
       of family life by "looking  not  just  for  a  sufficient  degree  of
       financial and emotional dependence to  constitute  family  life,  but
       also  for  some  extraordinary,  or  exceptional,  feature   in   the
       appellant's dependence upon his parents as a necessary determinant of
       the existence of his family life with them."


   27. The Court of Appeal in Rai made it especially clear that it  was  the
       pre-migration situation, rather than the fact  of  a  decision  being
       made by a parent to depart from Nepal  to  settle  in  the  UK,  that
       should be the primary focus of assessment. Lindblom LJ in Rai �38-41,
       identifying the flawed approach of the Upper Tribunal below which had
       concentrated unduly on what they perceived as a  choice  to  migrate,
       stated:

           "Throughout his findings and conclusions with regard to article
           8(1), the Upper Tribunal judge concentrated on the appellant's
           parents' decision to leave Nepal and settle in the United
           Kingdom, without, I think, focusing on the practical and
           financial realities entailed in that decision. This was, in my
           opinion, a mistaken approach. ... [this] was not to confront the
           real issue under article 8(1) in this case, which was whether,
           as a matter of fact, the appellant had demonstrated that he had
           a family life with his parents, which had existed at the time of
           their departure to settle in the United Kingdom and had endured
           beyond it, notwithstanding their having left Nepal when they did
           ... in consequence of the "historic injustice", it was only in
           2010 that his father had been able to apply for leave to enter
           the United Kingdom; that his parents would have applied upon the
           father's discharge from the army had that been possible; that
           they could not afford to apply at the same time as each other or
           with their dependent children ... the stark choice they had had
           to make was either to remain with the appellant ... in Nepal or
           to take up their long withheld entitlement to settle in the
           United Kingdom; that they would all have applied together if
           they could have afforded to do so; that the appellant had never
           left the family home in Nepal, begun an independent family life
           of his own, or found work outside the village; and that he had
           remained, as his father put it, "an integral part of the family
           unit" even after his parents had settled in the United Kingdom."

   28. The Court of Appeal in Rai went on to conclude that an error  of  law
       in the assessment of family life would itself be likely to render any
       proportionality assessment unlawful. In any  event,  when  evaluating
       proportionality, the approach of  Sedley  LJ  in  Patel  at  [15]  is
       relevant here:


           "... [The] effect of this is to reverse  the  usual  balance  of
           [article] 8  issues.  By  the  time  they  come  to  seek  entry
           clearance, adult children may well no  longer  be  part  of  the
           family life  of  British  overseas  citizens  who  have  finally
           secured British citizenship. If so, the threshold  of  [article]
           8(1) will not have  been  crossed  and  the  proportionality  of
           excluding them will not be an  issue.  If,  however,  they  come
           within the protection of [article] 8(1), the balance of  factors
           determining proportionality for the purposes of  [article]  8(2)
           will be influenced, perhaps decisively, by the fact (if it is  a
           fact) that, but for the history recounted  in  NH  (India),  the
           family would or might have settled here long ago."


   29. As this passage makes clear, the central question is  proportionality
       rather than a search for exceptionality. The Rules and  Guidance  are
       not necessarily determinative of the compatibility  of  the  decision
       appealed against with the family life  in  play  in  the  appeal.  It
       remains necessary to assess all relevant circumstances, having regard
       to the starting point in Patel and the absence of  any  overt  public
       interest factors counting against the application's success.


  Historic wrong


   30. The historic immigration wrong suffered  by  a  group  when  deciding
       whether  an  interference  with  family  life  is  proportionate   is
       something which  can  be  attributed  significant  weight,  given  NH
       (India) [2007] EWCA Civ  1330  which  discusses  the  past  injustice
       suffered by British Overseas Citizen female heads of  households  who
       were unable to apply to settle in the  United  Kingdom,  and  may  be
       decisive in the appropriate case. Gurung [2013] EWCA Civ 8 looked  at
       the applicability of  this  principle  to  Gurkha  cases,  the  Court
       concluding that:

         "[40] ... unless there is some evidence to suggest that there is  a
         real risk that (i) the Gurkha's adult dependant child  may  not  be
         given leave  to  enter,  for  example,  because  there  is  adverse
         information of a serious nature about him, or (ii) leave granted to
         the Gurkha or his  child  may  be  abrogated  in  the  future,  the
         difference between the two groups should be given little weight ...


         [41] ... the Appellant dependant child of a Gurkha who  is  settled
         in the UK has such a strong claim to have his  article  8(1)  right
         vindicated,  notwithstanding  the  potency  of  the  countervailing
         public interest in the maintaining of a  firm  immigration  policy.
         There is no  place  in  the  balancing  exercise  for  making  fine
         judgments as to whether one injustice is more immoral or worthy  of
         condemnation than another ... .
         [42] If a Gurkha can show that, but for the historic injustice,  he
         would have settled in the UK at a time  when  his  dependant  (now)
         adult child would have been able to accompany him  as  a  dependant
         child under the age of 18, that is a strong reason for holding that
         it is proportionate to permit the adult child to  join  his  family
         now."


   31. In Ghising [2012] UKUT 00161 (IAC) the UT stated:


           "121. Since the Respondent has provided a scheme  for  remedying
           the historic injustice in appropriate cases, there is  a  strong
           public interest in ensuring that the entry  of  Gurkha  veterans
           and  their  families  is  decided  fairly  and  consistently  in
           accordance with the scheme."


   32. However, the Master of the Rolls for the Court of  Appeal  Gurung  in
       disapproved that statement, in these terms:

           "43 ... We confess to having some difficulty  in  following  the
           reasoning at paras 117 to 119 and in seeing, in particular,  why
           the fact that an adult  dependant  child  may  be  permitted  to
           settle  here  in  "exceptional  circumstances"  leads   to   the
           conclusion that the weight to be given to the historic injustice
           in conducting the article 8(2) balancing  exercise  is  limited.
           The flexibility of the "exceptional circumstances" criterion  is
           such that it does not require the historic injustice to be taken
           into account at all. It certainly does not prescribe the  weight
           to be given to the injustice, if indeed it is to be  taken  into
           account. The requirement to take the injustice into  account  in
           striking a fair balance between the article 8(1) right  and  the
           public interest in maintaining  a  firm  immigration  policy  is
           inherent in article 8(2) itself, and it is  ultimately  for  the
           court to strike that balance. This requirement does  not  derive
           from the fact that the policy permits an adult  dependant  child
           to settle here in  exceptional  circumstances.  Accordingly,  we
           reject this additional reason given by the UT for  holding  that
           the weight to be given to the historic injustice is limited."

Conclusions: Error of law hearing

   33. Having set out that necessarily lengthy summary of the salient  legal
       authorities, I gave my reasons accepting that material errors of  law
       were committed by the First-tier Tribunal.


   34. This was a case where numerous aspects of the  Annex  K  policy  were
       satisfied:  the  Sponsor  had  been  granted  settlement  under   the
       discretionary arrangements, and  the  Appellant  is  his  son  living
       outside the UK who has not formed an independent family unit, and who
       satisfies the suitability criteria. The concerns raised by the First-
       tier Tribunal related to whether the Appellant  was  financially  and
       emotionally dependent  on  the  Sponsor,  and  whether  there  was  a
       justification for relaxing the normal requirement that he be under 30
       years old, bearing in mind he had lived apart from  the  Sponsor  for
       more than two years and had not applied as promptly as he might  have
       done.


   35. Firstly, the search for family life set too  high  a  threshold.  The
       enquiry into whether Article  8  ECHR  is  engaged  is  highly  fact-
       sensitive. The accepted facts before the Tribunal indicated that  the
       Appellant's mother, who  of  course  is  the  Sponsor's  spouse,  had
       considered it necessary to live apart from her husband  in  order  to
       reside with the Appellant in Nepal. This was a very strong indication
       that family life was engaged between them.

   36. As the Strasbourg Court observed in AA v UK,  where  a  young  person
       remains in the family unit after reaching majority,  family  life  is
       not interrupted. I  did  not  consider  that  one  can  say  it  will
       necessarily be subsequently  interrupted  thereafter  merely  by  the
       natural  maturing  process   where   the   individual   in   question
       nevertheless remains  living  with  one  parent,  absent  some  other
       express indicia of independence such as starting a family.  The  fact
       is that emotional dependency is likely to  increase  as  the  natural
       result of living together. That is precisely the point recognised  by
       Lord Bingham in Huang.

   37. It seemed to me that the First-tier Tribunal's repeated references to
       the absence of some specific health-related evidence indicated it was
       looking for some exceptional feature that the case law  does  not  in
       truth require. It could not be said of these facts that the Appellant
       was "no longer ... part of the family life" of lawful migrants to the
       UK, to use Sedley LJ's words in Patel. It was a material error of law
       to fail to assess family life against the apposite benchmark.


   38.  Secondly,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  referred  to  the  Appellant's
       mother's evidence that her increasing age-related frailty counted was
       increasing her physical dependency upon him.  It  appeared  that  the
       Judge (understandably) accepted this evidence. However,  it  was  not
       readily discernible how it was that this ostensibly express  evidence
       of elevated dependency was considered inadequate to reach the  family
       life threshold: cogent reasons would be required to  explain  such  a
       conclusion.

   39. Thirdly, the repeated search for some particularly close relationship
       with the father rather than the mother effectively  compartmentalised
       the family life in play to an unrealistic degree. Given  the  natural
       state of spouses is to cohabit, it  was  essential  to  give  careful
       attention to the extent to which this ageing couple  could  not  live
       together because of the perceived need for the mother  to  reside  in
       Nepal. The repeated references  to  the  Appellant's  lack  of  close
       emotional connections to the father failed to have regard to the full
       extent of family life interests that the facts entailed.

   40. Of course, the First-tier Tribunal rejected the appeal on grounds  of
       proportionality as well as family life.  Here  too  unfortunately  it
       fell into error.

   41. The misdirection on family life inevitably impacted on the assessment
       of proportionality, as the  Judge  clearly  believed  that  a  higher
       threshold needed to be crossed before  family  life  was  established
       than is in fact the case. Accordingly the  strength  of  family  life
       potentially in play here was afforded the wrong weight in the scales.
       This error inevitably infected the consideration of the  factors  set
       out in Appendix K at paragraph 9 generally.

   42. Furthermore, the Judge failed to appreciate that the usual balance of
       Article 8 issues is reversed in these cases. This was demonstrated by
       the Judge's reliance on section  117B  factors  which  represent  the
       routine immigration control considerations that are relevant  in  the
       normal migration case. However, the Court of Appeal  expressly  found
       in Rai �56, accepting the Appellant's  submissions  made  before  it,
       that "in view of the "historic injustice" underlying the  appellant's
       case, such considerations  would  have  made  no  difference  to  the
       outcome, and certainly no difference adverse to him."

   43. Finally, one gets no sense from the FTT decision that it  appreciated
       that the primary  question  in  assessing  proportionality  was  that
       identified by the Court of Appeal in Gurung �42: ie that  subject  to
       other public interest factors such as criminality,

           "If a Gurkha can show that, but for the historic  injustice,  he
           would have settled in the UK at a time when his dependant  (now)
           adult child would have been able to accompany him as a dependant
           child under the age of 18, that is a strong reason  for  holding
           that it is proportionate to permit the adult child to  join  his
           family now."


   44. Thus I held that that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  could
       not stand. As the parties agreed, the fact-finding  remaining  is  of
       relatively narrow compass though  the  legal  issues  are  relatively
       complex, and so it is appropriate to retain the matter in  the  Upper
       Tribunal for final determination.


  Decision and reasons - continuation hearing


   45. At the resumed hearing Mr Clarke took a realistic position on  behalf
       of the Secretary of State, recognising that there was no  real  basis
       to defend the appeal  once  the  law  was  properly  applied  to  the
       evidence. In those circumstances I can  be  relatively  brief  in  my
       reasoning.


   46. It is clear that family life endures here between the  Appellant  and
       his sponsoring parents. He has not set up an independent family  unit
       and continues to reside with  his  mother  for  significant  periods.
       Their relationship is a very close one and as his mother  has  become
       older she undoubtedly has  become  more  physically  and  emotionally
       dependent on him. This plainly satisfies the  test  for  family  life
       between adults, bearing in mind that the Appellant cannot  fairly  be
       treated as having left the family home of his own volition. Rather it
       has had to be reconstituted in Nepal.

   47. The family life of the Appellant, Sponsor and the Appellant's  mother
       is subject to very significant interference indeed by  the  need  for
       his mother to spend much of  her  time  living  separately  from  her
       husband in the UK in order to enjoy  family  life  with  her  son  in
       Nepal. Equally the  Appellant  is  prevented  from  living  with  his
       father, in a family unit that was split geographically  only  because
       of his father taking up the wrongfully delayed opportunity to  settle
       in the UK.

   48. The evidence establishes on balance of probabilities that the Sponsor
       would have settled in the UK, had the opportunity arisen, at  a  time
       when his son could have obtained indefinite leave to remain alongside
       him as his dependent child. The general policy consideration to limit
       applicants to the age of thirty is not an answer on the facts of this
       case where there continues to be real family life  evidenced  amongst
       the members of the family unit, particularly between the son and  his
       mother. There are no public  interest  factors  present  to  militate
       against the grant of  entry  clearance.  The  Appellant  is  of  good
       character and the application for him to join his parents in  the  UK
       has been made via the appropriate procedures.  I  accordingly  accept
       that the refusal  of  his  application  for  entry  clearance  was  a
       disproportionate interference with the family life involved.


          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained  material  errors  of
    law and was set aside.
    Following re-hearing in the Upper Tribunal, the appeal is allowed.

       Signed:                                             Date:  12   April
