        Applications for Permission to Appeal to the Court of Appeal




Having considered all documents lodged and  having  further  considered  the
oral and written submissions of Mr  C  Emezie  (of  Dylan,  Conrad,  Kreolle
Solicitors) and Ms S Reeves, of Counsel, instructed by the Government  Legal
Department in the first two cases (only) at hearings at Field House,  London
on 22 July and 09 September 2015


 Decision of The President, The Hon. Mr Justice McCloskey and Upper Tribunal
                    Judge Lindsley:  Applications Refused



(i)   An appeal lies to the Court of Appeal against a  costs  order  of  the
      Upper Tribunal made in immigration judicial review proceedings.

(ii)  In determining cost issues the Upper Tribunal will apply  M  v  London
      Borough of Croydon [2012] EWCA Civ 595.

(iii) Provided that a costs decision of the Upper  Tribunal  is  in  harmony
      with established principles and has a  tenable  basis,  permission  to
      appeal to the Court of Appeal is unlikely to be granted  because  cost
      decisions involve a substantial measure of discretion  dependent  upon
      one particular factual matrix.

(iv)  In judicial review proceedings  where  permission  to  appeal  is  not
      determined at a hearing,  the time limit for  applying  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal for permission to appeal  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  is  one
      calendar month, beginning on the date immediately  following  the  day
      upon which the Tribunal's substantive decision was sent and ending  on
      the corresponding date in the immediately succeeding month.

   v) This time limit is  capable  of  being  extended  in  accordance  with
      established principles and giving effect to the overriding objective.

  vi) Every Permission to Appeal (PTA) application must be made in  writing.
      There is no prescribed form.

 vii) In judicial review cases, the prescribed fee for  an  application  for
      permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal is presently ï¿½45.00.  Such
      applications do not require notice to the other parties.

viii)  The  substantive  requirements  for  every   permission   to   appeal
      application are enshrined in rule  44(7)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
      (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and are of cardinal importance.

  ix) A failure to comply with  rule  44(7)  engages  the  Upper  Tribunal's
      discretionary strike out powers under rule 8. The Tribunal will assess
      in particular the nature and gravity of the  non-compliance  and  will
      give effect to the principles  in  R  (SN)  v  SSHD  (striking  out  -
      principles) IJR [2015] UKUT 227 (IAC).


Introduction

(1)   This decision addresses certain issues  relating  to  applications  to
      the Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal to the  Court  of  Appeal.
      These three cases have been selected  for  consideration  together  as
      they raise common issues upon which guidance is desirable.


Soreefan

(2)   The framework of this case can be ascertained from the costs order  of
      Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul, dated 24 April 2015:

           "I order that the Respondent do pay 20% of the Applicant's costs
           to be assessed if not agreed. I order that the Applicant pay the
           Respondent's costs in preparing costs submissions to be assessed
           if not agreed.


           Reasons:


           While it is correct  that  the  applicant  sent  the  pre-action
           protocol letter to the respondent at an incorrect address, it is
           not said that the respondent did not receive it.   Further,  she
           resisted the application in the acknowledgement of service,  and
           a consent order was apparently proposed  only  after  permission
           was granted.  That said, permission  was  granted  on  only  one
           ground out of five.  The applicant was,  however,  compelled  to
           renew the application at some cost to her and the respondent has
           agreed to reconsider and if necessary  take  a  decision  giving
           rise to a right of appeal.  That is  effectively  a  substantial
           part of what was sought.


           I do however, consider that the respondent is  entitled  to  the
           costs of her costs submissions, given  that  the  applicant  has
           unreasonably sought her full costs."

   3) It is asserted by this Applicant's solicitors  that  the  sequence  of
      events thereafter was as follows:

      (a)   The above order was served on them on 28 April 2015.

      (b)   On 19 May 2015 the solicitors applied to the Court of Appeal for
           permission to appeal.

        c) On the same date, this application was rejected.


        d) On 20 May 2015, the Applicant's solicitors "applied", by letter,
           to the Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal and, on the  same
           date, conversed by telephone with an Upper Tribunal Lawyer.

        e) There was a further such conversation on 08 June 2015.

        f) By a letter dated 01 July 2015 an Upper Tribunal Lawyer notified
           the Applicant's solicitors that their application for permission
           to appeal would be listed on 21 July 2015.  The  letter  further
           stated:

                 "Can  you  kindly  comply  with  Rule  44(7)  of   Tribunal
                 Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  and  supply  further
                 details including (i) reasons why the application is lodged
                 out of time, (ii) identify the alleged error of law in  the
                 decision and (iii) state the result you are seeking ....


                 In addition please provide your written submissions to  the
                 Tribunal as to whether a fee is payable in respect of  your
                 application for permission to appeal; such  submissions  to
                 be received by the Tribunal not later than 14 July 2015."

        g) The Respondent's  representative  (hereinafter  the  "GLD")  was
           notified of the hearing by letter dated 03 July 2015.

   4)  The  Applicant's  solicitors  did  nothing   in   response   to   the
      notification/direction noted in (f) above.   As  a  result,  a  wasted
      hearing materialised on 21 July 2015 and an  adjournment  ensued.  The
      Tribunal ordered as follows:

        1] The hearing date of 21 July 2015 is vacated.


        2] There will be a re-listing before the same panel  of  judges  at
           10.00hrs on 09 September 2015.  In  making  this  direction  the
           convenience  of   both   parties'   representatives   has   been
           specifically considered.


        3] The Respondent's skeleton argument will be filed and  served  by
           14  August   2015.    This   will   include   the   Respondent's
           representations  concerning  the  costs  thrown  away   by   the
           adjournment on 21 July 2015 and any  application  for  a  wasted
           costs order against the Applicant's solicitors.


        4] The Applicant's solicitors will make any reply, in  writing,  by
           28 August 2015.


        5] Costs are reserved.


   5) Subsequently, the "Applicant's Response to Application  for  a  Wasted
      Costs Order" was lodged.  Further, the Respondent's skeleton  argument
      was received.  The hearing  giving  rise  to  the  decision  in  these
      conjoined cases was ultimately conducted on 09 September 2015.

   6) By order of Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson dated 17  April  2015  it  was
      determined that there be no  order  as  to  costs  inter-partes.   The
      framework of this case is evident from the terms of the Judge's order:

        1] On the 25th April 2013 the applicant issued his challenge to the
           refusal to grant leave to  remain  dated  7th  March  2013.  The
           remedies sought are set out in section 6 of the claim form.

        2] Mr Justice Silber refused permission on the  papers,  and  found
           the claim to be totally without merit, on 22nd October 2013. The
           renewed application came before Upper Tribunal Judge  Latter  on
           15th July 2014  when  permission  was  granted.  The  claim  was
           compromised by a consent order  sealed  on  12th  December  2014
           granting permission to the applicant to withdraw  the  claim  on
           the  basis  the  respondent  had  agreed   to   reconsider   the
           application for leave to remain  and  make  a  further  decision
           within three months of the date of the consent order.

        3] Judge Latter found there to be an arguable case. It has not been
           found the impugned decision  is  unlawful.  The  respondent  has
           adopted a pragmatic view leading to settlement.  The  respondent
           contends in a letter dated 7th January 2015 that  the  applicant
           failed to comply with the PAP and relied upon  new  material  to
           achieve the  grant  of  permission  which  was  not  before  the
           decision maker.


        4] The terms of the consent order  only  provide  an  agreement  to
           reconsider meaning the applicant  has  substantially  failed  to
           achieve the remedies sought in the claim.


        5] The appropriate award is for there to be no order as to costs.

      The sequence of events was thereafter as in Soreefan.

   7) By order of Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul dated 15  June  2015  it  was
      determined that there be no  order  as  to  costs  inter-partes.   The
      framework of this case emerges from the Judge's order:

      [1]   The respondent's submissions are out of time,  but  equally  the
           applicant has not replied thereto as provided for by the consent
           order, nor indicated that he is prejudiced by the late service.


        2] It is accepted that this is a case which falls  into  the  first
           category identified in M v Croydon [2012] EWCA Civ 595  in  that
           the applicant did obtain the remedy sought, but equally the pre-
           action protocol letter was sent to an incorrect address. Part of
           the claim was conceded in the response thereto  of  19  February
           2014.  I consider that, given the failure to correspond with the
           respondent thereafter, and given that there would  have  been  a
           right to challenge a continuing failure to review in  the  light
           of the response to the PAP, the commencement of proceedings  was
           premature and not necessary; this was not a straightforward case
           given the previous findings of the First-tier Tribunal.  In  all
           the  circumstances  of  this  case,  I  am  satisfied  that  the
           appropriate order is that there be no order for costs.


        3]  I  make  no  award  in  respect  of  the   respondent's   costs
           submissions. These are out of time, and while  I  have  admitted
           them, no evidence is produced to support the claim  as  to  when
           the consent order was served on the respondent.

   8) Thereafter, this Applicant's solicitors wrote to the  Upper  Tribunal,
      by letter dated 24th June 2015 stating:

            "We continue to represent the  above  named  Claimant  in  this
           Judicial Review matter.


           Further to the decisions of the Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul, we
           write to seek permission from the Upper Tribunal  to  appeal  to
           the Court of Appeal as we believe that there has been  an  error
           of Law in  the  manner  which  the  learned  Judge  applied  his
           discretion."


      Next, the solicitors requested an oral hearing by further letter dated
      15th July 2015 and the matter was listed for hearing on 21st July 2015
      in consequence.

Relevant statutory provisions

   9) S.13(1) of the Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act  2007  ("TCEA
      2007") provides for a right of appeal from the Upper Tribunal "on  any
      point of law arising from a decision made by the Upper Tribunal  other
      than an excluded decision" to the relevant appellate court,  which  in
      this case is the Court of Appeal. Pursuant to s.13(3) TCEA  2007,  the
      right of appeal may only be exercised with permission. Permission  may
      be given by the Upper Tribunal or the Court of Appeal  on  application
      by the party,  per  s.13(4)  of  the  TCEA  2007.  S.13(5)  TCEA  2007
      prescribes that:

            "An application  may  be  made  under  subsection  (4)  to  the
           relevant appellate court only if permission (or leave) has  been
           refused by the Upper Tribunal."

      By virtue of S.13(6) of TCEA 2007, the criteria  governing  the  grant
      of permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal are:

             "(a) that the proposed appeal would raise  practice,  or  some
              important point of principle or


              (b) that there is some other compelling reason for the
              relevant appellate court to hear the appeal."


      Further, the Appeals from the Upper Tribunal to the  Court  of  Appeal
      Order 2008 (the "2008 Order") provides:


           "Permission to appeal to the Court  of  Appeal  in  England  and
           Wales or leave to appeal to the  Court  of  Appeal  in  Northern
           Ireland shall not be granted unless the Upper Tribunal or, where
           the Upper Tribunal refuses permission,  the  relevant  appellate
           court, considers that-

             (a) the proposed appeal would raise some important point of
             principle or practice; or


             (b) there is some other compelling  reason  for  the  relevant
             appellate court to hear the appeal".

Relevant procedural rules

  10) Part 7 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  ("the
      Rules") begins by  cross  referring  to  the  2007  Act,  specifically
      sections 10 and 13 (per rule 41).  Rule 44(1) provides:

           "A person seeking permission  to  appeal  must  make  a  written
           application to the Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal."

      The governing time limits are regulated by  the  following  provisions
      of rule 44:

           "(3)  Where this paragraph applies, the application must be sent
           or delivered to the Upper Tribunal so that it is received within
           3 months after the date on which the Upper Tribunal sent to  the
           person making the application-


             (a) written notice of the decision;


             (b) notification of amended reasons for, or correction of, the
             decision following a review; or


             (c) notification that an application for the decision to be
             set aside has been unsuccessful.

           (3A)  An  application  under  paragraph  (1)  in  respect  of  a
           decision in an asylum case or an immigration case must  be  sent
           or delivered to the Upper Tribunal so that it is received within
           the appropriate period after the Upper Tribunal or, as the  case
           may be in an asylum case, the Secretary of State  for  the  Home
           Department, sent any of the documents in paragraph  (3)  to  the
           party making the application.


           (3B)  The appropriate period referred to in paragraph (3A) is as
           follows-


             (a) where the person who appealed to the First-tier Tribunal
             is in the United Kingdom at the time that the application is
             made-


                (i) twelve working days; or
                (ii) if the party making the application is in detention
                under the Immigration Acts, seven working days; and


             (b) where the person who appealed to the First-tier Tribunal
             is outside the United Kingdom at the time that the application
             is made, thirty eight days.


           (3C)  Where a notice  of  decision  is  sent  electronically  or
           delivered personally, the time limits in paragraph (3B) are-

             (a) in sub-paragraph (a)(i), ten working days;
             (b) in sub-paragraph (a)(ii), five working days; and
             (c) in sub-paragraph (b), ten working days.


        4) Where paragraph (3), (3A), (3D)  or  (4C)  does  not  apply,  an
           application under paragraph (1) must be sent or delivered to the
           Upper Tribunal so that it is received within 1 month  after  the
           latest of the dates on which the  Upper  Tribunal  sent  to  the
           person making the application-


             (a) written reasons for the decision;
             (b) notification of amended reasons for, or correction of, the
             decision following a review; or
             (c) notification that an application for the decision to be
             set aside has been unsuccessful.


        5) The date in paragraph (3)(c)  or  (4)(c)  applies  only  if  the
           application for the decision to be set aside was made within the
           time stipulated in rule  43  (setting  aside  a  decision  which
           disposes of proceedings) or any extension of that  time  granted
           by the Upper Tribunal."

Rule 44(6) makes provision for extending time:

           "If  the  person  seeking  permission  to  appeal  provides  the
           application to the Upper Tribunal later than the  time  required
           by paragraph (3), (3A), (3D) or (4), or by any extension of time
           under rule 5(3)(a) (power to extend time)-

             (a) the application must include a request for an extension of
             time and the reason why the application notice was not
             provided in time; and


             (b) unless the Upper Tribunal extends time for the application
             under rule 5(3)(a) (power to extend time) the Upper Tribunal
             must refuse the application."

      Finally, the content of an application for  permission  to  appeal  is
      governed by rule 44(7):


            "An application under paragraph (1) or (4A)(a) must-

             (a) identify the decision of the Upper Tribunal to which it
             relates;


             (b) identify the alleged error or errors of law in the
             decision; and


             (c) state the result the party making the application is
          seeking."


      [The amended provisions of rule 44(4) are reproduced in [24], infra]


  11) Rule 45(1) confers on the Upper  Tribunal  a  discretionary  power  to
      review  the  substantive  decision  under  challenge  in  the  limited
      circumstances specified in (a) and (b), upon receipt of an application
      for permission to appeal.  Notably, the exercise of  this  power  does
      not require a specific application or request on behalf of  the  would
      be appellant. Rather, this is very much an "own initiative" power. The
      review must be taken in accordance with rule 46.  By  virtue  of  rule
      45(2), the Upper  Tribunal  has  three  options  upon  receipt  of  an
      application for permission to appeal:

        a) To decide not to review the substantive decision.


        b) To review the  substantive  decision  and,  effectively,  affirm
           same, proceeding to determine the application for permission  to
           appeal.

        c) To review the substantive decision  and  take  some  "action  in
           relation to the decision or part of it".

     Next, by rule 48:


           "The Tribunal may treat an application  for  a  decision  to  be
           corrected, set aside or reviewed, or for  permission  to  appeal
           against a decision, as an  application  for  any  one  of  those
           things."

  12) Receipt of an application for permission to appeal also  triggers  the
      Upper  Tribunal's  general  powers  under  rule  5.   In  the  present
      litigation context the most important of these is the power to  extend
      time enshrined in rule 5(3).  The general  power  to  give  directions
      under rule 5(2) and rule 6(1) is also engaged. Furthermore, certain of
      the provisions of rule 7 are applicable:

           "(1)  An irregularity resulting from a failure  to  comply  with
           any requirement in  these  Rules,  a  practice  direction  or  a
           direction, does not of itself render void the proceedings or any
           step taken in the proceedings.


           (2)   If a party has failed to  comply  with  a  requirement  in
           these Rules, a practice direction  or  a  direction,  the  Upper
           Tribunal may take such action as it considers  just,  which  may
           include -

             (a) waiving the requirement;


             (b) requiring the failure to be remedied;


             (c) exercising its power under rule 8 (striking out a party's
             case); or


             (d) except in a mental health case, an asylum case or an
             immigration case, restricting a party's participation in the
             proceedings."


      Last, but by no means least, the overriding objective permeates all of
      the provisions of the rules mentioned above.  Per rule 2:


           "(1)  The overriding objective of these Rules is to enable the
           Upper Tribunal to deal with cases fairly and justly.


           (2)   Dealing with a case fairly and justly includes-


                 (a)    dealing with the case in ways which are
                       proportionate to the importance of the case, the
                       complexity of the issues, the anticipated costs and
                       the resources of the parties;


                 (b)    avoiding unnecessary formality and seeking
                       flexibility in the proceedings;


                 (c)   ensuring, so far as practicable, that the parties are
                       able to participate fully in the proceedings;


                 (d)   using any special expertise of the Upper Tribunal
                       effectively; and


                 (e)   avoiding delay, so far as compatible with proper
                       consideration of the issues.

           (3)   The Upper  Tribunal  must  seek  to  give  effect  to  the
           overriding objective when it-
                 (a)   exercises any power under these Rules; or
                 (b)   interprets any rule or practice direction.

           (4)    Parties must-
                        (a)   help  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  further   the
             overriding           objective; and

                       (b)  co-operate with the Upper Tribunal generally.


Appealing a costs order

  13) The first question to be addressed is whether an appeal to  the  Court
      of Appeal lies against a costs  order  of  the  Upper  Tribunal.   The
      principle that an appeal lies to a higher court or  tribunal  only  if
      provided by statute is one of some antiquity: see for example  Furtado
      v City of London Brewery Company [1914] KB  709  at  712.   Thus  this
      question is one of pure statutory construction.

  14) The relevant provisions of the 2007 Act are set out in [9] above.  The
      "right to appeal" from the Upper Tribunal to the Court of  Appeal  is,
      as section 13 considered as a whole makes clear, a right to apply  for
      permission to appeal. Such application must be made first to the Upper
      Tribunal, per section 13(5).  An appeal lies  "on  any  point  of  law
      arising from a decision made by  the  Upper  Tribunal  other  than  an
      excluded decision" (our emphasis): per section 13(1).   "Decision"  is
      nowhere  defined.   However,  there  is  an  elaborate  definition  of
      "excluded decision", in  section  13(8).   This  definition  does  not
      include any of the  following:  a  substantive  decision  in  judicial
      review proceedings,  an  interlocutory  decision  in  judicial  review
      proceedings or  a  costs  decision  in  judicial  review  proceedings.
      Indeed neither the expression "judicial review  proceedings"  nor  any
      equivalent thereof features in section 13.  This theme  is  reinforced
      by the consideration that section 13 belongs to a composite  group  of
      provisions, beginning with section 11, which provides for an appeal to
      the Upper Tribunal from the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT"),  followed  by
      the Upper Tribunal's powers in the determination of  such  appeals  in
      section 12, which is plainly concerned with appeals from the FtT.  The
      final member of this discrete unit is section 14, which prescribes the
      powers exercisable by the Court of Appeal in the event of finding that
      the Upper Tribunal's decision involved the making of  an  error  on  a
      point of law.

  15) The statutory appeals/judicial review  dichotomy  in  the  statute  is
      reinforced by the immediately succeeding group of  provisions,  namely
      sections 15 - 19,  which  are  arranged  under  the  rubric  "Judicial
      Review"  and  relate  exclusively  to  judicial  review   proceedings.
      Strikingly, as  originally  enacted,  there  is  nothing  within  this
      discrete group making provision for appeal from the Upper Tribunal  to
      the Court of Appeal in such proceedings.

  16) Based on this analysis of the statutory provisions we conclude that  a
      costs decision of  the  Upper  Tribunal  may  be  the  subject  of  an
      application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.  This  is
      illustrated by R (TH (Iran)) v East Sussex County  Court  [2013]  EWCA
      Civ 1027, which was an appeal to the Court of Appeal against the costs
      order of this Chamber in an age assessment judicial review case.   The
      determination of such applications is governed by s13(6) of TCEA  2007
      and the 2008 Order (supra).  Thus  the  criterion  to  be  applied  is
      whether the appeal raises an important point of principle or  practice
      or there is some other  compelling  reason  warranting  the  grant  of
      permission.  In practice, it is to be expected that  cases  satisfying
      this criterion will be very small in number.   The  basic  reason  for
      this is that costs decisions involve a substantial measure of judicial
      discretion.  Furthermore,  they  entail  the   application   of   well
      established principles to the individual litigation matrix.


  17) For present purposes, it suffices to draw  attention  to  the  general
      principles formulated by the Court of Appeal in M v London Borough  of
      Croydon [2012] EWCA Civ 595, which relate to the payment of  costs  in
      circumstances where judicial review proceedings are settled  following
      the grant of permission and prior to  the  substantive  hearing.   The
      Court promulgated the general rule that the  successful  party  should
      recover its costs from  the  unsuccessful  party.  Simultaneously,  it
      recognised that where a claimant  succeeds  on  some  issues  and  not
      others, the order may reflect this.  Importantly, this was a departure
      from the Court's earlier decision in R (Bahta) v  Secretary  of  State
      for the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ 895 that any degree of success
      prima facie entitled the claimant to full costs.   Indeed,  the  Court
      went further: even where a claimant has been wholly successful,  there
      may be reasons for not ordering the recovery of all costs. Notably, at
      the conclusion of the guidance section of the judgment, Lord Neuberger
      MR said the following, at [66]:

           "Having given such general guidance  on  costs  in  relation  to
           Administrative Court cases  which  settle  on  all  issues  save
           costs, it is right to emphasise that, as in most cases involving
           judicial guidance on costs, each case turns on its own facts.  A
           particular case may have an unusual feature which would,  or  at
           least could, justify departing from what would otherwise be  the
           appropriate costs order."

      The outcome of the appeal  is  noteworthy.   The  Court  decided  that
      having regard to two factors, namely (a) a change in the  law  between
      the initiation of  proceedings  and  the  grant  of  permission  which
      significantly  weakened  the   Defendant's   defence   and   (b)   the
      unreliability of the claimant's expert witness, the Defendant would be
      ordered to pay 50% of the claimant's costs to the date when permission
      was granted and 100% thereafter.

  18) We further consider it timely  to  draw  attention  to  the  following
      passage in M, at [44]:

           "............. an appellate court should normally be  very  slow
           indeed to interfere with any decision on costs."

      By way of general guidance, we consider that  provided  that  a  costs
      decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  in  harmony  with  established
      principles and has a tenable basis for the course chosen by the  Judge
      in the exercise of his discretion, it will  be  unassailable.   Judges
      determining  applications  for  permission  to  appeal  against  costs
      decisions should give effect to this general rule.

Prescribed form?

  19) In UTIAC proceedings,  practitioners  are  required  to  identify  the
      appropriate prescribed form by resort  to  the  UTIAC  website.   This
      reflects the long established practice of this chamber.  We believe it
      to be the practice of other chambers of the Upper Tribunal also.

  20) This prompts the question of whether there is a prescribed UTIAC  form
      for this purpose.  One of the features of UTIAC practice and procedure
      is that the 2008 Rules do not contain a comprehensive set of forms and
      notices.  Nor is  there  any  other  instrument  in  which  these  are
      gathered together. One of the reflections which this prompts  is  that
      Tribunal proceedings have, traditionally, been less  prescriptive  and
      more informal than proceedings in Courts.


  21) We have given consideration to  the  question  of  whether  Form  T484
      should be used for PTA applications.  This is a general form, designed
      to  be  employed  in  applications  for  which  no  special  form   is
      prescribed.  While we are satisfied that it  could  be  used  for  PTA
      applications,  we  have  been  unable  to  identify   any   obligatory
      requirement in this respect.  We are reinforced in this conclusion  by
      paragraph  6.1  of  the  Senior  President  of   Tribunal's   Practice
      Directions relating to the Immigration and Asylum Chambers of the  FtT
      and the Upper Tribunal.  This, under the rubric of "Form of Notice  of
      Appeal etc", provides, in material part:

           "The form of notice approved for the purpose of ...


           UT Rule 21 (Application to the Upper Tribunal for permission  to
           appeal) .....


           is the appropriate form as displayed on the  Tribunal's  website
           at the time when the notice is given,  or  that  form  with  any
           variations that circumstances may require."

      This provision of  the  Practice  Directions  is  clearly  focused  on
      appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the FtT.  It  is  not  directed  to
      judicial review proceedings.  Moreover, there is nothing comparable in
      the Practice Directions of the Senior President of Tribunals  relating
      to judicial review proceedings in this Chamber.

  22) Accordingly, the use of solicitors' letters for the purpose of  making
      the PTA applications  in  the  present  cases  did  not  infringe  any
      procedural rule or other norm.  The effect of our analysis is that PTA
      applications  in  judicial  review  proceedings  are  governed  by  no
      prescription other than that they be made in  writing.   In  practice,
      they will normally take the form  of  a  letter  or  Form  T484,  duly
      adapted.  Such applications will not, of  course,  be  in  writing  in
      cases where the issue of PTA to the  Court  of  Appeal  is  determined
      orally at the conclusion of a hearing,  which  will  normally  mean  a
      renewed application for permission to apply for judicial review  or  a
      substantive judicial review hearing.

The time limit for seeking permission to appeal

  23) The second issue requires us, firstly, to identify which of  the  time
      limit provisions in rule 44 applies to applications for permission  to
      appeal ("PTA") to the Court of Appeal in judicial review  proceedings.
      Such proceedings are to be distinguished from the other main component
      of the Chamber's jurisdiction, namely statutory appeals.   The  latter
      are described in the Rules as "asylum  case"  and  "immigration  case"
      respectively.   The combined effect of rule 44(3A) and (3B) is that in
      such cases any PTA application must be received by the Upper  Tribunal
      within twelve working days (reduced to seven, where the  applicant  is
      detained) of the date when the  Tribunal's  substantive  decision  was
      sent.  The definitions in rule 1(3) make clear that "asylum case"  and
      "immigration case" denote appeals to  the  Upper  Tribunal  under  the
      relevant provisions of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
      2002, the British Nationality Act 1981 and the  Immigration  (European
      Economic Area) Regulations 2006.  Accordingly, these provisions do not
      apply to judicial review proceedings.

  24) Rule 44(4)  was  amended  to  coincide  with  the  extension  of  this
      Chamber's  jurisdiction  to  encompass  immigration  judicial   review
      proceedings.  By rule 44(4A):

           44.- Application for permission to appeal
           (4A) Where a decision  that  disposes  of  immigration  judicial
           review proceedings is given at a hearing, a party may  apply  at
           that hearing for permission to appeal, and  the  Upper  Tribunal
           must  consider  at  the  hearing  whether  to  give  or   refuse
           permission to appeal.



      Rule 44(4B) provides:

           (4B) Where a decision  that  disposes  of  immigration  judicial
           review proceedings is given at a hearing and no application  for
           permission to appeal is made at that hearing-


              (a) the Upper  Tribunal  must  nonetheless  consider  at  the
              hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal; and


              (b) if permission to appeal is given to a party, it shall  be
              deemed for the purposes of section 13(4) of the 2007  Act  to
              be given on application by that party.

      Rule 44(4C) provides:

           (4C) Where a decision  that  disposes  of  immigration  judicial
           review proceedings is given pursuant to rule 30  and  the  Upper
           Tribunal records under  rule  30(4A)  that  the  application  is
           totally without merit, an application under paragraph  (1)  must
           be sent or delivered  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  so  that  it  is
           received within 7 days after the later of the dates on which the
           Upper Tribunal sent to the applicant-


              (a) written reasons for the decision; or


              (b) notification of amended reasons for, or correction of,
              the decision following a review.


      While there is no specific mention of cost orders -  whether  subsumed
      in a composite final order or free standing - in these  provisions  of
      the Rules, we consider that such orders are plainly embraced.

  25) In some cases, the issue  of  costs  may  not  be  determined  in  the
      Tribunal's substantive order.  This might occur,  for  example,  where
      the unsuccessful party is, by the  terms  of  such  order,  given  the
      opportunity to make written representations about costs.  We  consider
      that the correct analysis must be that  rule  44(4)  applies  to  such
      cases.  Thus, in such cases, any PTA application must be  received  by
      the Upper Tribunal within one month of the date  when  the  Tribunal's
      substantive decision was sent.  There is no mention anywhere  in  rule
      44(4) of "working days". Giving effect to the definition contained  in
      Schedule 1 to the Interpretation Act 1978, we construe "one month"  as
      one calendar month.  The word "after" conveys that the calculation  of
      the one month period begins on the day immediately following the  date
      of sending.


  26) While the definition of "month" provided by the Interpretation Act  is
      "calendar month", it extends no further. The measurement  of  the  one
      month period is potentially complicated, given that the Roman Calendar
      does not have a uniform measurement of a month - the variations  being
      27, 28, 30 and 31 days.  In this respect, we consider  that  the  only
      provision  of  rule  12  ("Calculating  Time")   applicable   to   PTA
      applications in judicial review  proceedings  is  paragraph  (1),  the
      effect where of is that the guillotine falls at 5pm on the last day of
      the period in question. In the  absence  of  definition  of  "calendar
      month" in either the Interpretation Act or the  2008  Rules,  judicial
      interpretation is required.  Happily, resort  to  a  well  established
      principle is available. The principle which is hereby engaged is known
      as the "corresponding date" principle, which boasts both pedigree  and
      antiquity.  It was described in the decision of the House of Lords  in
      Dodds v Walker [1981] 2 ALL ER 609, at page 610g, in these terms:

           "It is equally well established ...............  that  when  the
           relevant period is a month or specified number of  months  after
           the giving of a notice, the general rule is that the period ends
           upon the corresponding date in the appropriate subsequent month,
           ie the day of that month that bears the same number as  the  day
           of the earlier month on which the notice was given."

      Dilating on the practical outworkings of this principle, Lord  Diplock
      continues:

           "Because the number of days in five months of the year  is  less
           than in the seven others,  the  inevitable  consequence  of  the
           corresponding date rule is that one month's notice given in a 30
           day month is one day shorter than one month's notice given in  a
           31 day month and is  three  days  shorter  if  it  is  given  in
           February."

      Their Lordships noted that this "simple general rule" can be traced to
      the decision of the Court of Appeal in Freeman v Read [1863] 1 BF 174,
      at 184.

  27) It follows that the time limit for applying to the Upper Tribunal  for
      permission to appeal  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  judicial  review
      proceedings has the following elements:

      (a)   In cases where the issue of  PTA  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  is
           decided at the conclusion of a  hearing,  no  question  of  time
           limit arises.


      (b)   In other  cases,  the  paradigm  whereof  will  be  a  separate,
           subsequent decision on costs,  the  period  begins  on  the  day
           immediately following the date upon which the  decision  of  the
           Tribunal was sent  and ends  on  the  date  in  the  immediately
           succeeding month  which  corresponds   with  the  aforementioned
           date.


        c) There is a power to extend time and, where appropriate, the  PTA
           application must include a request for an extension of time  and
           an explanation of the lateness (infra).

Extending time

  28) The power to extend time, contained in rule 5(3)(a),  is  one  of  the
      Upper Tribunal's express case management powers.  It is  discretionary
      in nature.  While the  discretion  is  not  subject  to  any  explicit
      conditions or constraints, it is to be exercised  in  accordance  with
      established principles and considerations.  These have been formulated
      in various litigation spheres. Many of  them  are  conveniently  drawn
      together in Davis v Northern Ireland Carriers [1979] NI 19:

      (i)   An application made before expiry of the  period  will  be  more
           favourably received, if the reason is good.

      (ii)  Where time has expired, the extent of the default.

      iii) The effect on the other party and whether he can be  compensated
           in costs.


       iv) Whether there has already been a hearing on the merits.

        v) Whether there  is  a  point  of  substance  which  will  not  be
           determined if time is not extended.

       vi) Whether there is a point  of  general,  not  merely  particular,
           importance.

      vii) The rules are to be observed.

      This decision is to be considered in tandem with that of  the  English
      Court of Appeal in Costellow v Somerset CC [1993]  1  WLR  256,  which
      enshrines the additional guidance that all of the  circumstances  will
      be  considered  and  a  satisfactory  explanation  for  the  delay  is
      normally, though not invariably, required.  See also Savill v Southend
      HA [1995] 1 WLR 1254.


(29)  In R (SN) v SSHD (striking out  -  principles)  IJR  [2015]  UKUT  227
      (IAC), this Tribunal reviewed the leading decisions of  the  Court  of
      Appeal on the topic  of  default  generally:  see  [15]  -[20].   Most
      recently, these principles were applied in SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA  Civ
      387.

  30) Two of the factors to be weighed are the apparent merits of the appeal
      and the importance of the issues which it raises.  Judges will bear in
      mind that the criteria to be applied to an application for  permission
      to appeal to the Court of  Appeal  are  whether  the  proposed  appeal
      raises some important point of principle or practice or whether  there
      is some other compelling reason warranting the  grant  of  permission:
      see section 13(6) TCEA 2007 and the 2008 Order. While bearing in  mind
      the breadth of the discretion in play and the intensely fact sensitive
      nature of every case, judges may find it instructive  to  recall  that
      the principal factors taken  into  account  by  Griffiths  LJ  in  Van
      Stillevoldt BV v EL Carriers INC [1983] 1 WLR 207, at 212 - 213,  were
      that the delay was  of  short  dimensions;  there  were  personal  and
      professional reasons explaining the delay by the defaulting solicitor;
      there was an arguable case on appeal; and apart from having to  defend
      the appeal the other party would not be prejudiced by an extension  of
      time.

  31) Rule 44(6),  duly  nourished  by  good  practice  and  the  overriding
      objective in tandem, provides that where an application for permission
      to appeal to the Court of Appeal in  judicial  review  proceedings  is
      lodged out of time, it must incorporate a request to extend  time  and
      the grounds thereof.  We consider that every such  application  should
      set out full particulars and,  if  appropriate,  attach  any  relevant
      documentary evidence. While  a  witness  statement  is  likely  to  be
      unnecessary in the generality of cases, it may be highly desirable  in
      some. A frank, comprehensive and proactive application to extend  time
      in this way harmonises more readily with the explicit requirements  of
      the rules and the  philosophy  of  the  overriding  objective  than  a
      failure to do so and, hence, will normally have better prospects of  a
      favourable outcome.

PTA applications: substantive requirements

  32) The requirements applicable to every application to the Upper Tribunal
      for permission to appeal are unambiguous.  They are enshrined in  rule
      44(1) and (7).   Pursuant  to  the  first  of  these  provisions,  the
      application must  be  in  writing.   By  virtue  of  rule  44(7),  the
      application must:

      (a)   identify the decision of the Tribunal to which it relates.

      (b)   identify the alleged error or errors of  law  in  the  decision;
      and

      (c)   state the result the party making the application is seeking.

      We draw attention to the presumptively mandatory "must".

  33) As demonstrated in [10] - [12] above, rule 44(7)  does  not  exist  in
      isolation. Rather, it is to be considered, and applied, in conjunction
      with, firstly, rule 7.  Thus a failure  to  comply  with  any  of  the
      requirements of rule 44(7) may not be fatal. It would give rise to  an
      "irregularity", thereby engaging the discretion conferred on the Upper
      Tribunal by  rule  7(2).   In  accordance  with  this  provision,  the
      Tribunal "may take such action as it considers just".  This is a self-
      evidently broad discretion, in no way emasculated by the  inexhaustive
      menu of options which follows.  Furthermore, effect must be  given  to
      the overriding objective - see [2] above - in considering what  course
      should be taken in response to the irregularity flowing from a  breach
      of rule 44(7).

  34) In such situations, the basic choice available to the  Upper  Tribunal
      is to forgive the irregularity or to decline  to  do  so.   If  it  is
      disinclined to exercise forgiveness, we consider  that  rule  7(2)(c),
      the  terminology  whereof  is  "exercising  its  power  under  rule  8
      (striking out a party's case)", provides the proper  course  to  take.
      It appears to us that the  specific  provision  of  rule  8  which  is
      engaged is paragraph (3)(b), given that non-compliance with rule 44(7)
      is, in our estimation, a paradigm illustration of a litigant's failure
      to co-operate with the Upper Tribunal, considered in conjunction  with
      rule 2(4).

  35) Where an application for permission to appeal does not satisfy any  of
      the requirements in rule 44(7) it will  be  considered  invalid.   The
      starting point for the Upper Tribunal will be the nature  and  gravity
      of the non-compliance.  The three  requirements  are  listed  in  [32]
      above.   As  regards  requirement  (a),  a  failure  to  identify  the
      substantive decision  under  challenge  is  likely  to  be  viewed  as
      egregious in most instances.  On the other hand, where there  is  some
      doubt or obscurity arising out of the misspelling of  a  name  or  the
      manner in which a date or reference number is  formulated,  the  Upper
      Tribunal Judge will be more inclined to exercise the  power  contained
      in rule 7(2)(b) by requiring the matter to be remedied.  A failure  to
      comply with requirement (c) is, in principle, unlikely  to  be  viewed
      with strong disapproval since, whether expressly stated or not,  every
      application made under rule  44(1)  seeks  the  "result"  of  securing
      permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

  36) In practice, in many caess, the main focus of attention is  likely  to
      be on requirement (b) viz the stipulation  to  "identify  the  alleged
      error or errors of law in the decision".   Once  again,  the  starting
      point will be the nature and gravity of the  non-compliance.   In  the
      notional spectrum, the irregularity may range from minor to major.  In
      assessing its gravity, the Judge will bear in mind the decision of the
      Upper Tribunal in Nixon (Permission to Appeal:  Grounds)  [2014]  UKUT
      368 (IAC).  Though made in the different context of  applications  for
      permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal,  we  consider  that  its
      philosophy applies fully to PTA applications under  rule  44(1).   The
      message in Nixon is uncompromising:

           "[6]  It is axiomatic that every application for  permission  to
                 appeal to the Upper Tribunal should identify,  clearly  and
                 with all necessary particulars,  the  error/s  of  law  for
                 which the moving party contends.  This must be effected  in
                 terms  which  are  recognisable  and   comprehensible.    A
                 properly compiled application for permission to appeal will
                 convey at once to the Judge concerned the  error/s  of  law
                 said to have been committed. It should not be necessary for
                 the  permission  Judge  to  hunt  and  mine  in  order   to
                 understand the basis and thrust of the application."

      The Tribunal added:

           "[9]  Finally, representatives should be aware that  grounds  of
                 appeal presented in formulaic terms, particularly when they
                 reappear with frequency in a  multiplicity  of  cases  over
                 time, are likely to be received with circumspection. ...


                 'Boiler plating' will be quickly recognised by  permission
                 Judges.  Ditto make weights and embellishments."

  37) An application for permission to appeal assessed as belonging  to  the
      middle and upper levels of the notional default  spectrum  as  regards
      requirement (b) is unlikely to secure the forgiving exercise of either
      of the powers enshrined in rule 7(2)(a) and (b) or any  comparable  or
      kindred relaxation. Moreover, self evidently, permission  applications
      which are largely incoherent or unintelligible will, in the generality
      of cases, attract the sanction of being struck out. On the other hand,
      where the non-compliance with requirement (b) is assessed as belonging
      towards the lower end of the notional spectrum, some latitude  may  be
      appropriate. Furthermore, as observed in Nixon at [7], some adjustment
      may be appropriate in the case of an unrepresented party, taking  into
      account UTIAC Guidance Note Number 1 of  2011,  paragraph  10,  albeit
      this does not apply to applications for permission to  appeal  to  the
      Court of Appeal in judicial review proceedings.

  38) In all cases where there is non-compliance of any  species  with  rule
      44(7), thereby triggering the possible  exercise  of  the  strike  out
      power in rule 8(3), Judges should be mindful of the guidance contained
      in R (SN) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (striking out -
      principles) IJR [2015] UKUT 227 (IAC):

      (i)   In considering whether to exercise its discretionary strike  out
           power under rule 8, the main factors which  the  Upper  Tribunal
           will weigh are the interests of the administration  of  justice;
           whether there has been a prompt application for relief;  whether
           the failure was intentional; whether there is a good explanation
           for the failure; the number and importance of multiple failures;
           whether the failure  was  caused  by  the  party  or  his  legal
           representative; whether the trial date will  be  jeopardised  by
           the grant of relief; the effect on every party of  the  relevant
           failure; and the effect on every party of granting relief.

  39) The Tribunal will apply the following principles:  public  authorities
      and private litigants are to be treated alike; excessive work  burdens
      will rarely excuse a defaulting solicitor; and the mere  factor  of  a
      party being unrepresented does not constitute good reason.

  40) The Tribunal will be mindful of the draconian nature of a  strike  out
      order and will  take  into  account  the  availability  of  any  other
      appropriate and adequate sanction such as a wasted costs  order  under
      rule 10(3). Repeated defaults will  almost  invariably  be  considered
      more serious than a single act of non-compliance. In  every  case  the
      Tribunal will consider the question of whether its  process  is  being
      misused.

     These  principles  require  an  important  adjustment  in  rule  44(7)
     contexts, since the litigant concerned has already had a decision from
     the Upper Tribunal.  Thus the litigant's "case" does not  fall  to  be
     struck out.  Rather, the target of a strike  out  order  consequential
     upon a failure to comply  with  rule  44(7)  is  the  application  for
     permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

Fee payable?

  41) The payment of fees  in  judicial  review  proceedings  in  the  Upper
      Tribunal is governed by the Upper  Tribunal  (Immigration  and  Asylum
      Chamber) (Judicial Review) (England and Wales) Fees Order  2011  ("the
      Fees  Order").  This   applies   to   "immigration   judicial   review
      proceedings" which,  by  Article  1(2),  cross  refer  to  the  formal
      Direction of the Lord Chief Justice, paragraph 5 whereof includes  the
      language "and any proceedings relating thereto"  viz  relating  to  an
      "immigration matter".   The Fees Order is  a  measure  of  subordinate
      legislation made pursuant to section 42 of TCEA 2007,  which  empowers
      the Lord Chancellor to prescribe fees in respect  of  "anything  dealt
      with by the Upper Tribunal", by order.  Any such measure  is  preceded
      by obligatory consultation with the Senior President of Tribunals  and
      the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council.   Section  42(7)  is
      noteworthy:

           "The Lord Chancellor must take  such  steps  as  are  reasonably
           practicable to bring information about fees under subsection (1)
           to the attention of any person likely to have to pay them."

      This  duty  is  consonant  with  the  long  established  character  of
      Tribunal  proceedings  generally,  in  particular  the  focus  on  the
      litigant and the importance of access to justice.

  42) The Fees Order, which has undergone periodic amendment, prescribes the
      amount payable by a litigant for certain steps  and  applications.  It
      does so by the mechanism of a schedule which,  in  its  first  column,
      describes the step or application in respect whereof a fee is  payable
      and, in its second column, specifies the amount.  Each segment of  the
      schedule is identifiable by a paragraph number.  By paragraph  2.2  of
      Schedule 1 to the Fees Order, it is provided:

           "Number and Description of Fee               Amount of Fee


           On an application by consent or without
           notice where no other fee is specified.            ï¿½ 45.00"

      We consider it clear that every PTA application, whether  in  judicial
      review proceedings, must be accompanied by the payment  of  a  fee  of
      ï¿½45.00.  We are satisfied that the higher fee of ï¿½80.00, payable  (per
      paragraph 2.1) for "an application on notice where  no  other  fee  is
      specified", does not apply since there  is  no  provision  in  primary
      legislation or the 2008 Rules requiring PTA applications to be made on
      notice to the other party.

Conclusions

  43) We apply the principles and guidance outlined  above  to  the  present
      cases in the following way.  In the first two cases the  "application"
      for permission to appeal to the Court  of  Appeal  against  the  Upper
      Tribunal's costs decision  was  made  by  a  letter,  couched  in  the
      following terms:

           "We confirm that we seek permission to appeal to  the  Court  of
           Appeal against the decision of Upper Tribunal Judge [      ]  on
           the issue of costs.  We have spoken to  the  Tribunal  who  have
           checked and confirmed that the case is closed as  the  issue  in
           dispute is purely a costs issue and so the matter is  closed  in
           any event."


      The two letters were labelled  "Very  Urgent"and  each  contained  the
      following further sentence:


            "With respect, we seek permission out  of  time  to  appeal  the
           decision."

      In the third case the letter simply requested  permission  to  appeal.
      There was no request to  extend  time.   While  each  of  the  letters
      identified the name of the Applicant and the judicial review reference
      number, none of them had any attachment or enclosure.

  44) Accordingly, in all three cases, the "application" for  permission  to
      appeal  consisted  of  a  bare  letter,  comprising  seven  lines  and
      approximately 70 words.  It is in this context that  the  sequence  of
      events thereafter assumes importance.  As noted in [2]  -  [6]  above,
      the letters from the Applicants' solicitors in  the  first  two  cases
      were followed by a letter dated 01 July from a  Lawyer  of  the  Upper
      Tribunal, identifying a forthcoming hearing, (on 21  July  2015),  and
      politely requesting compliance with rule 44(7), together with  certain
      other particulars.    The Applicants' solicitors chose to ignore  this
      letter.  That  a  conscious  choice  was  made  is  clear  from  their
      submissions at the hearing. The only  further  communication  received
      from them was a letter dated 21 July 2015 suggesting  that  all  three
      cases be  listed  together.   This  had  already  been  arranged.  The
      sustained failure of the Applicants' solicitors to  comply  with  rule
      44(7) resulted in the wasted hearing which  materialised  on  21  July
      2015.  At this hearing the Applicants' representative brazenly  sought
      to justify the  non-compliance  with  the  rule,  coupled  with  their
      failure to make any reply to the letter  of  01  July  2015.   It  was
      argued that there was no need to comply with rule 44(7) or to  respond
      to the aforementioned letter because they had earlier, in response  to
      a direction issued by  the  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  to  both  parties,
      provided a written submission on costs.  This occurred in  advance  of
      the impugned costs decisions.

  45) It became clear at both the wasted hearing conducted on 21  July  2015
      and the further hearing transacted  on  09  September  2015  that  the
      Applicants'  solicitors  had  no  insight  into  the  inalienable  and
      unambiguous obligation to comply with rule 44(7) and, more  generally,
      to  co-operate  with  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  compliance  with   the
      overriding  objective.   They  consistently  adopted  a  position   of
      introspective righteousness and defiance.  This attitude was  manifest
      to the very end when,  at  the  commencement  of  the  second  of  the
      aforementioned hearings, their  representative  attempted  to  make  a
      submission based on rule 45(1) which had not been notified  previously
      to either the Respondent's representatives or the Tribunal. Sadly, our
      attempts to highlight the gravity and consequences  of  this  discrete
      misdemeanour fell on  deaf  ears.   Furthermore,  notwithstanding  the
      events on 21 July 2015, the default of the Applicants'  solicitors  in
      complying with rule 44(7)(b) endured  thereafter.   During  the  seven
      weeks which elapsed between  the  two  hearing  dates,  they  made  no
      acceptable attempt to rectify same.

  46) The net result is that, in all three cases:

      (a)   The "applications" for permission to appeal have  been  made  by
           letter and consist of a single sentence to this effect.

      (b)   There has been wholesale non-compliance with rule 44(7)(b).

        c)  Repeated  opportunities  to  rectify  this  default  have  been
           ignored.


        d) No grounds for an extension of time have ever been formulated.

        e) The clock has not stopped: rather, it continues to  run  against
           the Applicants.

  47) In the circumstances exhaustively outlined above, and given the  facts
      and factors highlighted above, the applications  have  no  discernible
      merit.  We can identify nothing in their  favour.   The  able  written
      submissions of Ms Reeves on  behalf  of  the  Respondent  contain,  in
      relation to the first two cases, the following passage:

           "...  The application for permission to appeal was made  out  of
           time and ...  there  has  been  wholesale  non-compliance  by/on
           behalf of the Applicant with the requirements  of  rule  44  and
           directions made by the Upper Tribunal on 01 July 2015 ....."

      We concur fully  with  this  submission.   No  valid  application  for
      permission to appeal has been made in any of these cases, due  to  the
      egregious contravention of rule  44(7)(b).  This  is  the  fundamental
      default  in  all  three  applications.   Furthermore,  the   mandatory
      requirement in rule 44(6)(a) to include a request for an extension  of
      time and to specify the reasons for the lateness  has  been  similarly
      neglected.

Wasted costs order

  48) This is the final issue to be addressed.  The Respondent, in the  case
      of Soreefan only,  applies  for  a  wasted  costs  order  against  the
      Applicant's solicitors in relation to the aborted hearing on  21  July
      2015.  The written submission of Ms Reeves accurately  identifies  the
      principal reasons for this aborted hearing in the following terms:

      (a)   The belatedly produced grounds of appeal and  skeleton  argument
           of the Applicants were not before the panel of Judges due to the
           failure to lodge them sooner than the afternoon of 20 July 2015.



      (b)   Wholesale non-compliance by the Applicant's solicitors with  the
           direction of 01 July 2015 and, by extension, the requirements of
           rule 44(7)(b).

        c) The non-service of the grounds of appeal and  skeleton  argument
           on the Respondent until the afternoon of 20 July 2015.

      We concur with Ms Reeves' submission that the adjournment  granted  in
      these circumstances constituted an indulgence to  the  Applicants  and
      their representatives.  The central pillar of the  Respondent's  costs
      application is the contention that, in the language of  rule  10(3)(d)
      of  the  2008  Rules,  the  Applicants'  representatives  have   acted
      unreasonably in their conduct of the proceedings.  The application  is
      further founded on Cancino (Costs: First-tier Tribunal -  New  Powers)
      [2015] UK FTT 00059 (IAC), highlighting in particular the adoption, at
      [19], of the three stage test formulated by the  Court  of  Appeal  in
      Ridehalgh v Horsefield [1994] CH 205.


  49) These are forceful submissions. However, we must take into account the
      virtually universal practice, spanning various  jurisdictions  in  the
      United Kingdom legal system, whereby applications  for  permission  to
      appeal are determined ex parte, on paper.  We must  further  recognise
      the  well-established  principle  that  a   Respondent/Defendant   who
      participates in the analogous context of a judicial review  permission
      hearing does so at its own risk as regards  costs.  We  balance  these
      principles  with  two  indelible  facts.   The  first  is   that   the
      Respondent's involvement in  the  determination  of  these  three  PTA
      applications was stimulated by the notification  given  by  the  Upper
      Tribunal.  The second is that this notification, in turn, was prompted
      by the defaults of the Applicants' representatives highlighted  above.
       We weigh these facts with the consideration that there is no previous
      decision of the Upper Tribunal warning  that  wasted  costs  could  be
      awarded in these circumstances. We further make clear that there is no
      question  of  awarding  wasted  costs  against   the   Applicants   in
      circumstances where the defaults are exclusively those of their  legal
      representatives.  Balancing all of these principles  and  factors,  we
      conclude, by a narrow  margin,  that  a  wasted  costs  order  is  not
      appropriate.  The Applicants' solicitors  should  consider  themselves
      fortunate to escape this sanction.

  50) Had we considered a wasted  cost  order  appropriate,  we  would  have
      awarded the full amount claimed by the  Secretary  of   State,  namely
      ï¿½1078.40. We would add  the  admonition  that  having  regard  to  the
      guidance promulgated in this  decision,  issues  of  wasted  costs  in
      analogous future cases may well be determined differently.

Omnibus conclusions

  51) To summarise:

      (i)   An appeal lies to the Court of Appeal against a costs  order  of
           the  Upper  Tribunal  made  in   immigration   judicial   review
           proceedings.

      (ii)  In determining cost issues the Upper Tribunal  will  apply  M  v
           London Borough of Croydon [2012] EWCA Civ 595.

      (iii) Provided that a costs decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  in
           harmony with established principles and has a tenable  basis  it
           will be unassailable.

      (iv)  In judicial review proceedings where permission to appeal is not
           determined at a hearing, the time  limit  for  applying  to  the
           Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal to the Court  of  Appeal
           is  one  calendar  month,  beginning  on  the  date  immediately
           following the day upon which the Tribunal's substantive decision
           was sent and ending on the corresponding date in the immediately
           succeeding month.

        v) This time limit is capable of being extended in accordance  with
           established principles  and  giving  effect  to  the  overriding
           objective.


       vi) Every PTA application should be made in  writing.  There  is  no
           prescribed form.

      vii) In judicial review cases, the prescribed fee for an  application
           for permission to appeal to the Court  of  Appeal  is  presently
           ï¿½45.00. Such applications do not require  notice  to  the  other
           parties.


     viii) The substantive requirements  for  every  permission  to  appeal
           application are enshrined in Rule 44(7) of the  2008  Rules  and
           are of cardinal importance.

       ix) A failure to comply with Rule 44(7) engages the Upper Tribunal's
           discretionary strike out powers under Rule 8. The Tribunal  will
           assess  in  particular  the  nature  and  gravity  of  the  non-
           compliance and will give effect to the principles in  R  (SN)  v
           SSHD (striking out - principles).


Disposal

  52) These applications for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal are
      struck out  pursuant  to  rule  7(2)(c)  and  rule  8   of  the  Rules
      accordingly. Insofar as the  Upper  Tribunal  is  seized  of  a  valid
      application to extend time in any of the three cases, same is refused.
      We would add that the applications would have been  refused  on  their
      merits in any event: see [17] - [18] above.
