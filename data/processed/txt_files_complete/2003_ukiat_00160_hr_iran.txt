                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1.  The  Secretary  of  State  appeals  the  determination   of   an
      Adjudicator (Mr. M. E. Curzon Lewis) who allowed the appeal of  a
      citizen of Iran, (here and after for convenience referred  to  as
      the Appellant) against the decision of the Secretary of State  to
      refuse his application for asylum.


   2. Mr. G. Phillip appeared for the Secretary of State. Mr. Gaskin of
      Counsel, instructed by Elder Rahimi represented the Appellant.

   3. The Adjudicator determined the  appeal  without  considering  its
      merits under Rule 33(2)(a) of the Procedure Rules. In the grounds
      of appeal settled by the Secretary of State he submitted that the
      Adjudicator was in error in failing to consider the case  on  its
      merits  and  reference  was  made  to  the   case   of   Muhammad
      (01/TH/11233). Furthermore, the case had been listed for  mention
      only and the Adjudicator had  erred  in  determining  the  appeal
      substantively on that date.

   4. The Tribunal delivered its decision at the hearing on 7  November
      2003. Unfortunately there has been a failure in the recording  of
      the determination and what follows is  an  attempt  to  reproduce
      what was said then.

   5. The appeal was initially listed for a substantive  hearing  on  9
      September 2002. The evidence for the Appellant included what  was
      said to be a court verdict, arrest  warrant,  court  summons  and
      trading licence. The Presenting Officer on that occasion  applied
      for and was granted an adjournment to enable the  exhibit  to  be
      authenticated.

   6. The next hearing was on 22 October 2002. The  Presenting  Officer
      applied for an adjournment. While the documents had been sent  to
      the British High Commission in Tehran on 15 September 2002,  they
      had not yet been authenticated. The Adjudicator had  granted  the
      adjournment and had given a direction which had been subsequently
      issued on 25 October 2002 in the following terms:

        'The Respondent's representative shall notify all  parties  on
        the timetable for the production of  the  verification  report
        if, either it is not available for the for mention hearing or,
        if it is available at either  a  sooner  or  later  date.  The
        report to be sent  at  least  seven  days  before  any  listed
        hearing date.'


   7. The case was  not  listed  for  mention  but  was  listed  for  a
      substantive hearing before the Adjudicator on 5 December 2002. On
      that occasion the Presenting Officer told  the  Adjudicator  that
      she had telephoned the appropriate office  who  had  stated  that
      there was a backlog for authenticating  documents  in  Iran.  The
      authenticating officer  in  Tehran  had  gone  on  leave  and  no
      specific return date could be given.


   8. It was stated that the Presenting Officer on 9 September 2002 had
      indicated that if the documents were found to be genuine, he, the
      Presenting Officer, would be minded to grant asylum.

   9. The Adjudicator then proceeded to determine the matter under Rule
      33(2)(a) without consideration of  the  merits.  He  allowed  the
      Appellant's appeal. He noted that  the  Respondent  had  been  in
      possession of the  evidence  for  more  than  three  months.  The
      difficulties for the Secretary of State's agents in  Tehran  were
      freely acknowledged by the Adjudicator  but  had  to  be  weighed
      against the seriousness of the evidence in the  particular  case.
      The Adjudicator  found  that  the  burden  of  proving  that  the
      documents were not genuine shifted to the Respondent.

  10. Mr. Phillip relied on the grounds of appeal  and  submitted  that
      Tanveer Ahmed [2002] UKIAT 00439 established that the  burden  of
      proof remained on the Appellant throughout.

  11.  Mr. Gaskin submitted that  the  case  was  an  unusual  one.  He
      accepted that usually a breach of directions should not result in
      summary judgement but nothing appeared to have been done  in  the
      intervening period. The Appellant had had his claim  allowed  and
      had been in limbo for an extended period.

  12. It appears to the Tribunal that the Adjudicator  was  clearly  in
      error in this case in allowing the appeal  without  consideration
      of its merits. Firstly, the delay had not been a very  long  one.
      The Presenting Officer had originally applied for an adjournment.
      This was not resisted by the Appellant. In our view, Adjudicators
      should not adjourn proceedings in  circumstances  such  as  this,
      they should determine the matter then and there. As Tanveer Ahmed
      makes clear, the burden remains throughout on the Appellants  and
      their  representatives.  The  Adjudicator   clearly   misdirected
      himself in this respect.

  13. The direction issued by the Adjudicator on 25 October 2002 is not
      in the least clear. The Secretary of State was directed to notify
      the parties  about  the  timetable  for  the  production  of  the
      verification report. It was not made clear what would  follow  if
      the  timetable  was  not  complied  with.  Furthermore,  it   was
      represented that there would be a for mention hearing and  not  a
      substantive hearing. The Tribunal has indicated on many occasions
      that it is generally inappropriate to  determine  asylum  appeals
      without consideration of the merits. The Adjudicator stated  that
      the Respondent had failed to comply with the directions but it is
      not clear that he had. He had informed the Adjudicator that there
      was a backlog in determining authentication reports.

  14. It would have been open to the Adjudicator at any stage  to  have
      determined this  appeal  on  its  merits.  The  Adjudicator,  for
      example, might have been satisfied, having considered the  matter
      in the round, that the documents were authentic.  It  would  have
      been necessary for the Adjudicator,  however,  to  have  reminded
      himself that the burden remained on the Appellant.

  15. We appreciate that there has subsequently been  delay,  but  that
      does not justify the approach of the Adjudicator in this case.

  16. This case illustrates well  the  wisdom  of  determining  appeals
      rather than adjourning them. Secondly, if directions  are  issued
      they should be clear in their terms. Thirdly, if it is  indicated
      that a case is to be listed for mention, then it should be listed
      for mention.

  17. For the reasons we have given, this Adjudication is reversed. The
      Secretary of State's  appeal  is  allowed.  The  matter  must  be
      remitted for a hearing before a different Adjudicator.

  18. The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated.



                                                                 Mr. G. Warr
                                                              Vice President
