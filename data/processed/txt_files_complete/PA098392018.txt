                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent



For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Katani & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Clark, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the UT against a decision  by  Judge  McGrade,
    promulgated on 12 October 2018, on grounds set out in  her  application
    dated 5 December 2018.


 2. (There appears to have been administrative confusion over  whether  the
    application was submitted timeously.  It has  been  treated  as  if  so
    made.)

 3. UT Judge Stephen Smith granted permission on 10 October 2019.

 4. The grounds firstly, at [2], allege error at [17 - 18] "by  failing  to
    be slow to draw adverse inferences from failure  of  the  appellant  to
    mention [her] religion [?] at screening  interview".    Kavungu  [2002]
    UKIAT 00246 and YL ( Rely on SEF ) China [2004] UKIAT 00145 are  cited.



 5. The passage held adverse to the appellant is at page  D7,  respondent's
    FtT bundle, Q/A 5.4:

      Have you ever been detained, either in the UK or  any  other  country,
      for any reason?

      No.

 6. Mr Winter drew attention to D5, Q/A 4.1, where the appellant  said  she
    supported Taiwanese independence, consistently with her later  account,
    and to D4, 3.2, where she was asked if she was  ever  fingerprinted  in
    any country "including your own" - words not included in  the  form  at
    5.4.   He  said  this  showed  scope  for  misunderstanding  the  later
    question.   He  referred  also  to  F13,  Q/A  54-55,  the  substantive
    interview,  where  the  appellant  said  she  had  been  arrested.   He
    submitted that there was error in that either (a) there  was,  properly
    understood, no inconsistency, or (b) the matter was explicable, and  an
    adverse inference had been too readily drawn.

 7. The grounds at [3] challenge the decision at [20] over  the  evaluation
    of the appellant's evidence about being required to report.  Mr  Winter
    had little to add.  He said that  the  essential  point  was  that  the
    appellant's evidence about when she had to  report  might  have  raised
    questions, but it was not inconsistent.

 8. The grounds at [4] maintain that the  decision  at  [21]  is  simply  a
    statement that the evidence is not credible, and is not a reason.

 9. The grounds at [5] say that at [22-23]  the  FtT  "recharacterised  the
    evidence based on its own perception of reasonability".

10. The grounds at [6] allege error at [24] in finding the appellant to  be
    of no interest to the  authorities  because  she  was  not  stopped  or
    questioned on various trips in and out of China  after  her  detention,
    because release from detention does not necessarily equate  to  absence
    of interest.

11. The grounds at [7], on family planning policy, were not pursued.

12. Mr Winter sought a remit to the FtT.


13. Mr Clark replied thus:

      On [2], YL is authority that discrepancies from screening interview do
      require explanation - see [16-17].  It was  the  appellant's  case  to
      make, and she did not suggest  that  she  had  been  confused  by  the
      wording of the question.  The question was clear.  It was not for  the
      judge to conjure up an explanation which she  did  not  advance  until
      this late stage.

      On [3], the judge was right to identify an inconsistency.

      On [4], the decision, read as a whole,  provided  a  legally  adequate
      explanation, identifying and resolving the issues - see [16, 17, 18-25
      and 28].

      On  [5],  the  reasons  were  sound,  and  not  based  on  any   false
      perspective.

      On [6], it was reasonable to infer a lack of interest.

      The grounds amounted only to disagreement on the facts,  and  did  not
      show error on points of law.

14. I reserved my decision.

15. Ground [2] does not show that the judge took an incorrect  approach  to
    evidence derived from a screening interview.  A  clear  discrepancy  is
    correctly identified at [17].  The suggestion of  misunderstanding  the
    question is rather ingenious, but also rather farfetched.  The question
    is plain.  This possible explanation was not part of the  case  in  the
    FtT, and is advanced too late.

16. The grounds  at  [3]  may  strictly  be  correct  in  saying  that  the
    appellant's evidence about reporting  was  much  the  same  throughout.
    However, the underlying point, on looking at the evidence, is that  she
    gave no comprehensible account of when she had to report,  and  whether
    this is analysed as an inconsistency or as something else,  it  was  an
    obvious weakness.

17. The grounds at [4] are selective.  Reasons are to  be  taken  not  only
    from [21] - no good reason to support Taiwanese independence, but  from
    [17-19] - discrepancies;  [20]  -  no  comprehensible  account  of  the
    reporting requirement; [22] - unlikelihood of an educated person  being
    unaware  that  she  could  not  in  China  freely   support   Taiwanese
    independence; the rapidity with which she would have become aware  that
    strangers did not welcome approaches on the topic; [23-24] - travel  in
    and out of China after risk allegedly arose, showing both that she  had
    no fear and that the authorities had no interest; and [25]  -  no  good
    reason for delaying claim in UK.

18. The grounds at [5] are only a disagreement put in generic  terms  of  a
    legal error.  The appellant's ability and willingness to travel in  and
    out of China were obviously open to the judge's interpretation.


19. As to [6], the decision is based not on a presumption that release from
    detention is always the end of adverse interest, but  on  the  specific
    facts of the case.

20. Together, the grounds do not amount  to  more  than  disagreement  with
    factual conclusions which were well within the scope  of  the  tribunal
    and for which a legally adequate explanation has been given.   They  do
    not disclose the making of any error on a point of law.

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

22. The FtT made an anonymity direction.  The matter was not  addressed  in
    the UT.  Anonymity is preserved.
