Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms Chaggar, Counsel instructed by Hiren Patel
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Smart, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants appeal to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing their appeal against the decision of the
    respondent to refuse to vary their leave to  remain,  and  against  the
    Secretary of State's concomitant decision to remove them from the UK by
    way of directions under Section  47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality  Act  2006.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an
    anonymity direction, and I do not consider that the appellants  require
    to be accorded anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellants are all nationals of India.  The first appellant is  the
    wife of the second appellant, and the third appellant  is  their  child
    who was born in India on 5 February 2002.  The first appellant  is  the
    main appellant in this appeal, and so I shall hereafter  refer  to  her
    simply as the appellant save where the context otherwise requires.

 3. In December 2012 the appellant applied for leave to remain as a Tier  1
    Entrepreneur Migrant, with her husband and son  as  dependants  on  her
    application.  She was going to be part of an  entrepreneurial  team  of
    which the other member was Nileshkumar Patel.  He was  also  an  Indian
    national.  At G4, she indicated that she was relying on four  documents
    as evidence of the amount of money that was available  for  investment.
    These four documents related to funds held overseas.   The  funds  were
    provided by a third party.  Each of the four parcels of funds was  held
    by the third party in the State Bank of India.

 4. On 17 March 2013 the respondent refused the appellant's application  as
    she had failed  to  submit  the  specified  evidence  as  listed  under
    paragraph 41-SD to show that she had access to at least  �200,000.   In
    particular:

      a) Letters from State Bank of  India  did  not  name  the  appellant's
         entrepreneurial team member and did not provide a telephone  number
         for the third party funder.  In addition no authorised official was
         identified.

      b) The third party declaration document was  not  dated  and  did  not
         identify  that  the  funds  were  equally  accessible  and   freely
         disposable in the UK.

      c) The letter from the legal representative was not acceptable  as  it
         did not validate the signatures of the third party funder or  refer
         to his/her ID document.

 5. The appellant appealed against the refusal  decision,  and  her  appeal
    came  before  Judge  Thorne  sitting  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  at
    Nottingham on 22 November 2013.  In his  subsequent  determination,  he
    noted the grounds of refusal.  But he observed at paragraph  [12]  that
    the refusal letter made no reference to the exercise of  discretion  or
    the obligation to consider paragraph 245AA of the Rules.  It also  made
    no reference to the obligation to consider the best  interests  of  the
    child under Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act
    2009.  The judge went on to find at paragraph [26]  that  although  the
    appellant had failed to submit the correct  documents  in  the  correct
    format as specified in the highly prescriptive and technical Rules, the
    respondent had also failed to follow  the  same  Rules  by  failing  to
    consider  the  question  of  exercising  discretion  by  reference   to
    paragraph 245AA of the Rules,  the  evidential  flexibility  policy  or
    general common law principles of fairness.  In addition, the respondent
    failed to have any regard to obligations to consider the best interests
    of the child under Section 55.  In the circumstances, he concluded that
    the refusal decision was not in accordance with the law, and  a  lawful
    decision remained outstanding.

 6. On 19 May 2014 the Secretary of State gave her reasons for  re-refusing
    the appellant's application upon reconsideration.  She referred to  41-
    SD(a), which states that the specified documents to  show  evidence  of
    the money available  to  invest  are  one  or  more  of  the  following
    specified documents:

    (i)  A letter from each financial institution  holding  the  funds,  to
         confirm the amount of money available.  Each letter must:

         (1)  Be an original document and not a copy ...

         (4)  Have been produced within the three months immediately  before
             the date of the application

 7. The documents she provided met the required criteria for all the eleven
    sub-paragraphs of sub-paragraph (i) apart from  sub-paragraph  (1)  and
    sub-paragraph (4).

 8. There had not been compliance with sub-paragraph (1) as copies had been
    sent, not originals.  The solicitors had said at the time of writing on
    23 April 2014 that the originals were on their way from India to the UK
    by fastest courier option, and would be provided in a couple  of  days.
    It was now 9 May 2014, and the originals had not been received.

 9. There was non-compliance with sub-paragraph (4) as the application date
    was 10 December 2012 but the bank letters were  dated  21,  22  and  23
    April 2014 and clearly had not been produced within  the  three  months
    immediately before the date of the application. So  the  appellant  was
    therefore not considered to have access to the funds that she claimed.

10. Insofar as it is material, the bank letters referred to in the  refusal
    decision related to funding by different third party sponsors.  Whereas
    previously the appellant had purported to be funded by a family  friend
    and investor by the name of Mr Saiyad the new funding was  provided  by
    three people all with the surname Patel (two males and one female)  and
    all of whom banked with the State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur.

11. In her grounds of appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  appellant
    disputed the claim that she had not provided originals of the specified
    documents.  She was going to provide a postal receipt  and  a  printout
    from the Royal Mail  website  confirming  delivery  of  the  documents.
    Also, her legal representatives called the respondent on  29  April  at
    14.57 and had spoken to someone called Miss Maisy and she had confirmed
    the documents received.

12. As for the allegation of non-compliance with sub-paragraph  (4),  there
    had been inordinate delay in the processing of her application.  So her
    earlier third party had refused to continue his support.   She  changed
    her third party, and had  requested  the  respondent  to  consider  her
    application based on the documents provided  by  her  new  third  party
    funders.  Nowhere in the Rules was it stated that while the application
    was  under  consideration  the  third  party  funder   could   not   be
    substituted.  Her position could be  distinguished  from  the  scenario
    where  someone  did  not  have  access  to  �200,000  at  the  date  of
    application, and access was gained after the application was submitted.
     In this case,  she  did  have  access  to  �200,000  on  the  date  of
    application, but she had simply substituted the third  party.   It  was
    not reasonable for a third party to continue to hold such a  large  sum
    of money for such a long and uncertain period of time, and it  was  due
    to the inordinate delay that she was forced to change her third party.

The Hearing before, the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

13. The appeals of all three appellants came before Judge Colyer sitting at
    Nottingham Justice Centre  on  30  October  2014.   Both  parties  were
    legally represented.  The appellant adopted as her evidence-in-chief  a
    witness statement which reflected the broad thrust of  the  grounds  of
    appeal.  In his closing submissions on  behalf  of  the  appellant,  Mr
    Patel said there were cases where the Home Office had accepted a change
    of third party finance.  He insisted the appellant had access to  third
    party funds at the date of application.  He  contended  that  the  Rule
    that the third party should be named in the application should  not  be
    applied strictly.

14. In his  subsequent  decision,  the  judge  addressed  the  question  of
    specified documents in paragraphs [24] to [31].  He noted that  in  the
    appellant's bundle there was a letter from Hiren Patel Solicitors dated
    25 April 2014 to the Home Office indicating that  they  were  enclosing
    original documents, including three letters  from  the  State  Bank  of
    Bikaner and Jaipur, India.  He also noted the letter  asking  the  Home
    Office to note their clients were supported by different third parties,
    and requested the Home Office to kindly ignore  documents  provided  by
    the earlier third party in regards to access to �200,000 in  favour  of
    the documents provided with this letter.

15. The judge found at paragraph [30] that the appellants had not addressed
    the issue appropriately raised by the respondent, which was the failure
    of the appellant to provide the original document issued by  Mr  Saiyad
    to support evidence of third party finance.  The judge  held  that  the
    original was not produced.  So the respondent was correct to refuse the
    application on this ground.

16. The judge went on to address  the  question  of  compliance  with  sub-
    paragraph (4) under the heading of third party  finance.  At  paragraph
    [33], he found the application was made on 10 December  2012,  and  the
    respondent was correct in stating that the bank letters were dated  21,
    22 and 23 April 2014 and thus had clearly not been produced within  the
    three months immediately before the date of the application.  He  found
    the respondent was correct in law to decide that the appellant did  not
    qualify for the award of required points under Appendix A.

17. The judge went on to give extensive consideration to  the  question  of
    common law fairness, the best interest of the third appellant, and  the
    alternative claim under Article 8 ECHR.  He dismissed  the  appeals  of
    all three appellants on all grounds raised.

The Application for Permission to Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

18. Mr Zane Malik of Counsel, who did not appear below, settled the grounds
    of appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   He  contended  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had misconstrued paragraphs 41 and  41-SD  in  dismissing  the
    appellant's appeal under the Rules.  He submitted that the  appellant's
    application for leave to remain made on 10 December  2012  was  validly
    varied when she submitted evidence as to the second third party sponsor
    on 24 April 2014.  The judge had erred in law in failing  to  take  the
    date of 24 April 2014 as the date of application for  the  purposes  of
    paragraphs 41 and  41-SD.   His  approach  was  inconsistent  with  the
    reported decision of the Upper Tribunal in Qureshi (Tier 4 -  effective
    variation - Appendix C) Pakistan [2011] UKUT 00412 (IAC).

19. He submitted that Qureshi had been endorsed by the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Nasim and Others (Raju: reasons to follow?) [2013] UKUT 610 (IAC),  and
    that the correctness of the general principles set out in  Qureshi  and
    Nasim were not disturbed by  the  Court  of  Appeal  when  it  recently
    considered those decisions in Rasheed v Secretary of State for the Home
    Department [2014] EWCA Civ 1493.

The Rule 24 Response

20. On 12 February 2015 Tony Melvin of the Specialist Appeals Team  settled
    the Rule 24 response on behalf the  Secretary  of  State  opposing  the
    appeal.  The Immigration Rules were quite clear the sponsor had to show
    that the funds  were  available  prior  to  the  application.   It  was
    unacceptable for the third party sponsor  to  change  post-application,
    and the appellant to expect the Rules to be met.   The  first  decision
    (of Judge Thorne) remitted the case back for the Secretary of State  to
    consider a part of the application again, not to consider a  completely
    different sponsor as if that sponsor was providing  evidence  from  the
    date of application.   The  judge  has  directed  himself  properly  in
    accordance with the Rules and the law.

The Grant of Permission

21. On 23 January 2015 Judge Michael Keane granted permission to appeal  on
    the ground raised  by  Mr  Malik.   He  observed  the  application  for
    permission was not concerned with the judge's dismissal  of  the  human
    rights appeal, and accordingly permission to appeal was only granted in
    respect of the judge's dismissal  of  the  appeal  in  respect  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

22. Before me, Mr Smart relied on the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department v Raju and Others [2013] EWCA Civ 754 as showing that  Judge
    Colyer had directed himself appropriately.  As this authority  had  not
    been mentioned in the Rule 24 response, Ms Chaggar said  she  had  been
    taken by surprise.  So I adjourned for 30 minutes  at  her  request  so
    that she could consider this  authority.   On  the  resumption  of  the
    hearing, Ms Chaggar adhered to the  line  taken  by  Mr  Malik  in  the
    application for permission to appeal.  She disagreed with Mr Smart that
    Qureshi had been wrongly decided.

Discussion

23. As became apparent in the course of argument, Judge Colyer confused the
    first application with the purported variation of the application  when
    addressing the question of whether the appellant had provided  original
    bank letters.  According to the determination of Judge Thorne,  it  was
    not alleged by the respondent that the appellant had failed to  provide
    original bank letters in respect of the purported third  party  funding
    from Mr Saiyad.  The problem with  the  bank  letters  relating  to  Mr
    Saiyad was not that they were not originals, but they did  not  contain
    various important pieces of information, including a  certification  by
    the bank that the funds in Mr Saiyad's account were  available  to  the
    entrepreneurial team members.

24. The alleged non-compliance with sub-paragraph (i) related to the second
    set of third party funding documents.  Judge  Colyer  did  not  clearly
    resolve this issue.  However, the implication of his line of  reasoning
    is that he accepted on the balance of probabilities that original  bank
    letters relating to the second set of  third  party  funders  had  been
    provided to the Home Office under cover of the letter of 25 April 2013,
    but that this was irrelevant, as there had been non-compliance with sub-
    paragraph (4).

25. Raju supports the position taken by  Mr  Smart.   Raju  overturned  the
    Upper Tribunal decision which allowed the appeals of  Mr  Raju  and  Mr
    Khatel, among others, against the decision  to  refuse  to  vary  their
    leave to remain on the  ground  they  had  not  been  notified  of  the
    required  qualification  (United   Kingdom   recognised   Bachelor   or
    Postgraduate Degree) by the time  they  submitted  their  applications.
    The  Upper  Tribunal  found  in  their  favour,   by   treating   their
    applications as starting when the applications were  first  lodged  and
    remaining open until they were decided.  The Court of Appeal found that
    this approach was based on a misconstruction of paragraph  34G  of  the
    Rules, which provides that the date on which an  application  or  claim
    (or a variation in accordance with paragraph 34E) is made on is on  the
    date of posting, if the application form is sent by post;  and  on  the
    date  on  which  the  online  application  is  submitted,   where   the
    application is made via the online application process.  The Court held
    that an application is made when paragraph 34G says it is made:

         The Secretary of State at the date of  her  decision  assesses  the
         evidence which determines whether the applicant for leave to remain
         as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant has  accumulated  75  points.
         Whether that evidence was assessed by the Secretary  of  State,  or
         even later, by a Tribunal, these  applicants  could  not  score  75
         points because they had made their  applications  before  they  had
         obtained their qualifications.   On  a  true  construction  of  the
         relevant Rule, the fourth section of table 10 in Appendix  A,  they
         could not score the fifteen points they  needed.   No  subsequently
         obtained evidence could cure that defect.  AQ does not assist these
         respondents.  From authority for the proposition on which the Upper
         Tribunal relied, that the applications were 'made'  throughout  the
         period starting with the date of  their  submission  and  finishing
         with the date of the decisions.

26. By parity of reasoning, the wording of sub-paragraph (4) makes it plain
    that the bank  letter  showing  third  party  funding  must  have  been
    produced within three months before the date  that  an  application  is
    made in accordance with paragraph 34G.  It is not suggested  on  behalf
    of the appellant that she submitted a new application,  or  varied  her
    application in accordance with paragraph 34G, after 10  December  2012.
    What is in contemplation in sub-paragraph (4) is an  application  which
    has been made  in  one  of  the  four  alternative  ways  specified  in
    paragraph 34G, and it is only the application of 10 December 2012 which
    counts as an application for the purposes of the sub-paragraph.

27. I consider that Qureshi turns on its own special facts.  The  appellant
    made an in time application for the purposes of further studies in  the
    UK.   She  then  sought  subsequently  to  vary  the   application   in
    anticipation of that course expiring or coming to an end on 21  January
    2011.  At the time she made the application on 12 August 2010,  it  was
    for an extension of leave to remain in order to study at Empire College
    London.  On 15 December 2010 she wrote to the  Home  Office  explaining
    that her course at Empire College London was going to end on 21 January
    2011, and informing the Home Office that she been accepted onto  a  new
    course of MSc Management at Birmingham City University due to start  in
    January 2011.  Her student CAS  information  for  the  new  course  and
    institution was enclosed with her letter.  She asked the Home Office to
    "include this" with her Tier 4 application.  On  12  January  2011  she
    wrote again to the Home Office  with  further  details  about  her  new
    course.

28. The respondent subsequently refused her application.  She  was  awarded
    points as claimed for her CAS from Birmingham City University  assigned
    on 10 December 2010.  But no points were awarded for maintenance.  This
    was because the amount which she had in her bank statements for her two
    HSBC accounts for the period running up to the date of her  application
    in August was not sufficient  to  cover  the  additional  cost  of  her
    studying at Birmingham City University.

29. The appeal was allowed by the First-tier Judge on the ground  that  the
    Home Office had treated the appellant as making the application  on  12
    January 2011, because they based their decision on  what  she  said  in
    that letter, and not on what had been said in her original application.
     The appellant had the required funds in her HSBC account  for  the  28
    day period leading up to 12 January 2011, and therefore he allowed  the
    appeal.

30. In the Upper Tribunal, Mr Tufan on behalf of the respondent  maintained
    it was incumbent upon the appellant to demonstrate the availability  of
    specified funds as of 12 August, being the date of the application.  He
    accepted that the  evidence  before  the  respondent  showed  that  the
    funding requirement was met with  regard  to  her  studying  at  Empire
    College, London.

31. Accordingly, Mr Tufan effectively conceded that  the  judge  below  had
    reached the right result, albeit (in Mr Tufan's  view)  for  the  wrong
    reason. Although she  was  applying  for  leave  to  study  on  a  more
    expensive course, she only  needed  to  show  funding  for  the  course
    referred to in the original  application.   Despite  acknowledging  the
    illogicality in his position, Mr Tufan maintained  12  August  was  the
    effective date for assessment  under  Appendix  C  -  even  though  the
    appellant would not have known of the cost of the new  course  at  that
    juncture.

32. The Upper Tribunal held that there was no indication in Appendix A that
    the Attributes needed to be in place at the time  of  application.   On
    that  basis,  they  were  satisfied  that  a  Tier  4  General  Student
    application could be varied at any time under Section  3C(5).   If  the
    appellant sought to vary her application for the  same  purpose,  which
    was further leave to remain in the United Kingdom in  order  to  pursue
    studies, the variation which she sought (and which was accepted by  the
    Home Office) was  not  one  which  was  caught  by  the  provisions  in
    paragraph 34E of the Rules.  As to the date  which  the  respondent  is
    required to take into account  for  the  purposes  of  determining  the
    points to be awarded under Appendix C, where there has been a variation
    substituting a new college, it is the date of the most recent variation
    for the purposes of paragraph 1A(C): paragraph [38].

33. I do not consider that Qureshi is authority for  the  proposition  that
    the appellant in this appeal, who was applying for leave to remain as a
    Tier 1 Entrepreneur Migrant - not for leave to remain as  a  student  -
    had the right to substitute alternative third party funding by way of a
    variation  of  her  original  application.    The   present   case   is
    distinguishable from  Qureshi  both  on  the  law  and  on  the  facts.
    Firstly, the Upper Tribunal was not asked to consider how paragraph 34G
    impacted on their line of reasoning.   Secondly,  the  parties  in  the
    Upper Tribunal did not dispute that the appellant should succeed in her
    appeal: the only question was by what route.  Thirdly,  the  respondent
    accepted  a  fundamental  variation  of  her  original  application  by
    accepting a CAS for a  completely  different  course  at  a  completely
    different institution and for a different start date.   So  commonsense
    dictated that the application date  had  to  shift  from  the  original
    application date for the  purposes  of  calculating  maintenance  under
    Appendix C.  Fourthly, and perhaps most importantly, it was conceded by
    the  Secretary  of  State  that  the  appellant  met  the   maintenance
    requirements as of the date of application, albeit in relation  to  her
    original course of study.  Conversely, the  appellant  here  failed  to
    produce the specified documents  to  show  that  she  had  third  party
    funding at the date of  her  application  in  December  2010.   So  the
    appellant did not show that she was "substituting" one source of  third
    party funding which was in place in December 2010 with  another  source
    of third party funding which she had secured in April 2014.

34. An additional consideration is that, on her own case,  there  has  been
    non-compliance with  paragraph  245DD(h)(iii).   Sub-paragraph  (h)  of
    paragraph 245DD provides that the Secretary of State must be satisfied,
    inter alia, that:

    (iii)    The money referred to in table 4 of Appendix A is genuinely
         available to the applicant, and will remain available to him until
         such time as it is spent for the purposes of his business or
         businesses.

35. The evidence of the appellant is that the original third  party  funder
    at some unspecified point in time withdrew his funding,  and  thus  the
    money referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A is not  genuinely  available
    to her, and will not remain available to her until such time as  it  is
    spent for the purpose of her business or businesses.

36. Paragraph 245D(C), states that  where  paragraphs  245D  to  245DF  and
    paragraph 35-53 of Appendix A,  referred  to  money  remaining  to  the
    applicant until such time as it  is  spent  for  the  purposes  of  his
    business or businesses:

    (i)  "Available" means that the funds are:

         (1)  in the applicant's own possession,

         (2)  in the financial accounts  for  UK  incorporated  business  of
             which she is the director, or

         (3)  available from  the  third  party  or  parties  named  in  the
             application   (my   emphasis)   under   the   terms   of   the
             declaration(s) referred to in paragraph 41-SD(b)  of  Appendix
             A.

37. The third parties now sought to be relied upon were not  named  in  the
    application form submitted on 10 December 2012.  Mr Saiyad was also not
    named in the form itself, but sufficient detail and  documentation  was
    provided with the application to make it clear that  it  was  his  four
    bank accounts with the State Bank of India that were being relied  upon
    as the source of funding; and so Mr Saiyad, and Mr Saiyad alone, is the
    third party "named" in the application.

38. In conclusion, for the reasons given above, I find that the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal did  not  contain  a  material  error  of  law.
    Accordingly, the decision stands.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
