Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Lemer, Counsel, instructed by Middlesex Law
Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Farmer dismissing the  Appellant's  appeal  against
    the Respondent's decision refusing to grant asylum and to remove him by
    way  of  directions  pursuant  to  Section  82  of   the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 2. The Appellant appealed against the decision of  Judge  Farmer  and  was
    granted permission to appeal by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Plimmer.   The
    grounds upon which permission was granted may be summarised as follows:

 a) It is arguable that the First-tier Tribunal has  unlawfully  failed  to
    consider the plausibility of the Appellant's claims  in  light  of  the
    detailed background evidence available in TG and others (Afghan  Sikhs)
    CG UKUT 595 (IAC), when making its credibility assessment.  The  First-
    tier Tribunal has  referred  to  TG  at  �38,  but  only  after  having
    completed the credibility assessment.

 b) It is also arguable that the First-tier Tribunal has applied an  overly
    strict interpretation to the Appellant's claim to have been in  hiding:
    �26.

 c) All grounds are arguable.

 3. The Respondent provided a Rule 24 reply that was duly considered by all
    present before the hearing commenced.

    Error of Law

 4. At the close of submissions I indicated that I found there was an error
    of law in the decision such that it should be set aside, but  indicated
    that my reasons would follow.  My reasons for  so  finding  a  material
    error are as follows.

 5. In relation to the First-tier  Tribunal's  assessment  of  the  country
    guidance case of TG I find that  it  is  correct  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did not consider TG or its terms until  it  was  mentioned  at
    paragraph 38 and again at paragraph 42.  In my view the guidance within
    TG is such that it would have arguably or feasibly tipped  the  balance
    in favour of the Appellant given that the adverse credibility  findings
    made against him, although several in number, were in truth minor  ones
    in the context of the claim and  the  centrepiece  of  the  Appellant's
    account.  Indeed, the First-tier Tribunal noted at paragraph 38 that it
    had "already found that  the  Appellant's  account  was  not  credible"
    before going on to consider the country guidance case.

 6. It is also an error of law that the Tribunal failed to have  regard  to
    the  objective  position  summarised  in  TG  regarding  the  risk   of
    harassment and ill-treatment against Afghan Sikhs before  reaching  the
    credibility finding at paragraph 37 of the determination.  Mr Lemer for
    the Appellant took me to several passages within TG  which  fortify  my
    decision.  In summary those passages are the assessment  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal of the expert evidence  received  from  the  country  experts,
    namely Dr Ballard, whose evidence  may  be  seen  at  paragraph  32  in
    particular and in respect of Dr Giustozzi, whose evidence may  be  seen
    at paragraphs 35 to 37.  The evidence of both experts was found  to  be
    of great assistance to the Upper Tribunal, as affirmed at paragraphs 76
    to 77 and at paragraph 87 of that decision.  Whilst the Upper  Tribunal
    accepted that not all Afghan Sikhs or Hindus were at risk, the evidence
    from the experts is nonetheless relevant, particularly in  the  context
    of this claim given that the  experts  confirm  in  the  aforementioned
    paragraphs that Afghan Sikhs are being targeted for kidnapping and  are
    also at risk of killing amongst other mistreatment from  extremists  in
    Afghanistan.  In that regard it was a material error for the First-tier
    Tribunal to not give consideration to the country guidance  case  which
    demonstrates a prevalence of abductions and killings  of  Afghan  Sikhs
    before rejecting the Appellant's account in  that  specific  regard  as
    incredible.

 7. I also find there is error in the First-tier Tribunal's  assessment  of
    the Appellant's credibility at paragraphs 24, 26 and 27 to  the  extent
    that the First-tier Tribunal has in my view applied  an  overly  strict
    interpretation of the Appellant's claim.  In respect  of  paragraph  25
    and the Appellant's account that he was in hiding, there is said to  be
    a discrepancy between the Appellant's account in his interview and that
    in his witness statement and oral evidence at  the  hearing.   However,
    the Appellant cannot  be  responsible  for  the  shortcomings  in  that
    evidence as a result of difficulties with the quality of interpretation
    at the substantive asylum interview, which criticism does not appear to
    have been challenged by the Respondent. I note the Appellant  requested
    a copy of the interview tape to substantiate his  complaint,  but  that
    recording was, as far as I  am  aware,  not  provided  to  him  or  his
    representatives to allow him to verify the quality and accuracy of  the
    interpretation at his interview.

 8. I note that  the  clarification  of  the  answers  given  in  interview
    additionally took place approximately one  month  after  the  interview
    itself by way  of  the  Appellant's  witness  statement  and  thus  the
    Appellant did  clarify  his  evidence  in  an  appropriate  way  before
    attending his hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.   In  respect  of
    the discrepancy at paragraph 25 that the Appellant claimed to have gone
    into hiding, but may not have been, in my view the judge has not  given
    reasons for discounting the evidence given  by  the  Appellant  in  his
    witness statement which more reliable as a starting point given that it
    did not suffer from difficulties  in  interpretation  discussed  above.
    Thus in my view  it  would  have  been  necessary  for  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to reach a view upon whether the Appellant's evidence  in  his
    witness statement was credible or not,  as  opposed  to  comparing  and
    contrasting that evidence with the less accurate  interpretation  given
    in his asylum interview.

 9. Next, in respect of the finding at paragraph 26 that the Appellant  was
    not in hiding because his son would  go  to  the  pharmacy  to  collect
    medication every one to two weeks, in my  view  that  assessment  again
    takes an overly strict interpretation of the Appellant's claim and  the
    practicalities of his day-to-day life which did not reveal that he  was
    living openly in Afghan society but, on his own account, was in  hiding
    and did not go out personally, but sent his son to collect  medication,
    which is tantamount to living in hiding than living  openly  and  being
    seen out and about, conducting one's  normal  daily  affairs,  such  as
    collecting medication.

10. In respect of paragraph 27 and the  timing  of  the  abduction  of  the
    Appellant's family, the criticism that the timing of his  discovery  of
    their absence after three to four hours,  and  his  discussion  with  a
    pharmacist that the family were abducted half an hour before  he  spoke
    to that pharmacist, is confusing and is of little assistance in gauging
    the Appellant's credibility.  It is feasible that the Appellant  waited
    for several hours for his family to return, ventured  out  reluctantly,
    spoke to a pharmacist only to be told that they were taken half an hour
    earlier and that account would still arguably fit within the  timeframe
    of three to four hours having passed since the family left his company.
     As such there is no  clear  internal  inconsistency.   Unless  precise
    timings were known of the Appellant's and his family's whereabouts that
    day, which they are not, this assessment is of limited utility  in  the
    context of an assessment of the  risk  on  return  illustrated  by  his
    family's abduction and not knowing their whereabouts till date.

11. In summary, I find that the First-tier Tribunal materially erred in its
    consideration  of   the   Appellant's   credibility;   and   in   those
    circumstances, I find that there were errors of  law  in  the  decision
    such that it should be set aside.

Notice of Decision

The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  set  aside  and  the  appeal  is
remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  to  be  heard  by  a   differently
constituted bench.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
