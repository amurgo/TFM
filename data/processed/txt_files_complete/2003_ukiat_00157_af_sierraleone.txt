Representation
For the appellant:     Mr I Kumi, Counsel instructed by Owen White &
                       Catlin, Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mrs C Golding, Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      This is an appeal by a citizen of Sierra Leone against the decision of
      an adjudicator, Mr D Taylor, sitting at Hatton Cross on 16 June  2003,
      dismissing his appeal against refusal of leave to enter on both asylum
      and human rights grounds.

   2. The appellant gave a history in his statement of involvement with  the
      RUF.  This began as involvement of an involuntary kind,  in  which  he
      was conscripted to act as a porter and took part in  their  activities
      on that basis only until the end of the civil war and incorporation of
      the RUF in the political  process  in  November  1999.   Mr  Kumi  has
      realistically conceded that nothing in the appellant's own  activities
      before that date was likely to put him at risk on return now.

   3. The current case  put  forward  by  the  appellant  is  based  on  the
      activities of a political kind, in which he says he  took  part  since
      that date.  These appear to have been part  of  the  normal  political
      process.  The suggestion that they were likely to result  in  anything
      outside the ambit of that is based on an item from a newspaper  called
      "New Vision", published in  Sierra  Leone  on  2  October  2002.   The
      original newspaper was before the adjudicator  and  it  has  been  put
      before us  as  well.   The  adjudicator  simply  notes  "The  original
      newspaper was produced to me to confirm its authenticity".  We have to
      say that the appearance of the article  in  question,  occupying  what
      appears to be one box on a  page  otherwise  composed  of  advertising
      material, was one which, in our view, merited much closer  examination
      than the adjudicator gave it.  However, we are certainly not proposing
      in any way to go behind his findings on that point.

   4. What the article consisted in was a photograph which may well be  that
      of the appellant, and a general review of what was  going  on  in  the
      country and,  in  particular,  in  the  Kailahun  district.  The  last
      paragraph needs to be quoted in full:

      Aiah Foday is  the  latest  victim  of  the  CDU  wrath.   He  was  an
      outstanding critique of the SLPP government and organiser of  the  RUF
      Party ITAM/USL branch.  Sources disclosed that he was forced  to  flee
      from his 16 Personage Street resident at Kissy, Freetown, to an unknow
      destination on the night of 30 September 2002 by a group of  CDU  who,
      according to sources, needed him to  answer  certain  questions  at  D
      Division Office (Kissy).  Police  investigation  into  the  matter  is
      still going on.


   5. The suggestion that these events were likely to put the  appellant  at
      real risk on return is based on only one piece of relevant  background
      evidence, which is the Home Office's own operational guidance note  of
      December 2002.  The adjudicator does not quote the actual terms of the
      relevant passage of  the  note,  but  simply  (at  paragraph  25)  the
      submission made to him on it by counsel for the appellant before  him,
      who was not Mr Kumi.  The same counsel equally forbore in his  grounds
      of appeal to quote directly from the operational  guidance  note.   We
      however shall do so.

      As there is an ongoing peace  process  that  appears  to  be  holding,
      applications based on involvement with rebel groups are unlikely to be
      well-founded as such individuals are not generally facing  harassment.
      However, given that in some cases there may be  a  resentment  against
      prominent members of a rebel organisation because of their  activities
      while members of such groups it is possible that the threshold may  be
      passed because of their individual circumstances.

   6. Mr Kumi's case before us was that the appellant's  activities  in  the
      political  sphere,  described  in  his  statement,  might   make   the
      authorities in the shape of the CDU see him as a "prominent member" of
      the  RUF.   In  our  view,  that  is  a  complete  misreading  of  the
      operational guidance note.  There may be some excuse for that, because
      it is not a document originally intended for public  consumption,  and
      it may not be so clear in its terms as documents which are prepared on
      that basis, like the State Department report or the Amnesty report.
   7. Neither of these reports contains any passage that Mr  Kumi  has  been
      able to refer us to which suggests that people would be at risk merely
      for being a member, prominent or otherwise, of the RUF as a  political
      party. It is quite clear to us that the reference to "activities while
      members of such groups" in the operational  guidance  note  refers  to
      persons who may well be suspected  of  having  been  involved  in  the
      serious atrocities which took place during the course of the civil war
      in Sierra Leone.  It is clearly intended to be read in that historical
      context, and we do  not  consider  that  it  has  any  application  to
      whatever may take place during the current political process in Sierra
      Leone.

   8. The adjudicator dealt with the present situation and the effect of the
      article in this way at paragraph 35.

      The appellant did not claim to have been a  prominent  member  of  the
      rebel organisation as such.  He claims to have been a prominent member
      of the political party and relies  on  the  "New  Vision"  article  in
      support of that.  However what the article states is that the CDU wish
      him to  "answer  certain  questions".  The  police  and  the  CDU  are
      responsible for the proper maintenance of  law  and  order  in  Sierra
      Leone.  It is to me significant that the appellant has not  gone  into
      any particular detail of his activities while under  detention.   That
      means by the RUF before the ceasefire nor of his political  activities
      after it.

   9. In our view, even after accepting  the  apparent  genuineness  of  the
      newspaper article, the adjudicator was perfectly entitled in the light
      of the background evidence in this case, to deal with it in  that  way
      and the appeal is dismissed.

                                                                  (chairman)
