Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Mackenzie, Counsel instructed by Just Immigration
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a national of China, from the Hong Kong SAR, born on
       15 October 1971. She appeals with permission[1] the decision of First-
       tier Tribunal Judge Robertson[2] to  dismiss  her  appeal  against  a
       decision to remove her from the United Kingdom pursuant to  s  47  of
       the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006.   That  decision
       followed from the Respondent's rejection on 14 October  2014  of  the
       Appellant's in-time application for leave to  remain  in  the  United
       Kingdom on the basis of her family and private life.

       Background

    2. The basis of the Appellant's application made on 29  August  2014  is
       that she is married to a British national, Daniel Chafen, who she met
       whilst he was working in Hong  Kong  between  2008  and  2013.  Their
       daughter, Scarlett Beatrix Chafen was born on 14 February 2011 and is
       a dual British and Chinese national. In September 2013, Mr Chafen was
       made redundant by his employer and the  family  came  to  the  United
       Kingdom on 26 December 2013. They  decided  to  come  to  the  United
       Kingdom as a family and that the Appellant would come  as  a  visitor
       first and then apply to change  her  status  to  a  spouse  when  her
       husband found a job. They said that they did not know that they would
       be unable to do this.

    3. The basis of the Respondent's refusal was that the Appellant did  not
       meet the requirements of paragraph E-LTRP 3.1 of Appendix FM  as  she
       was a visitor; the financial requirements at  E-LTRP  3.1.-3.3.  were
       not met as  some  of  the  payslips  and  bank  statements  were  not
       originals or verified  and  thus  she  could  not  benefit  from  the
       criteria set out in EX.1 and EX.2 of Appendix FM of  the  Immigration
       Rules.   The   Respondent   also   considered   whether   exceptional
       circumstances had been raised and asserted that the  Appellant  would
       have been expected to apply for a spouse visa with the correct  entry
       clearance and it would not be unreasonable for her to  do  so  either
       alone or accompanied by her Sponsor and child.

    4. At the hearing before the First Tier Tribunal it was argued  that  in
       light of section 117B(6) of the NIAA 2002 it was  not  reasonable  to
       expect a British citizen child to leave the United Kingdom  and  this
       was supported by case law and the Respondent's policy as set  out  in
       the Immigration Directorates' Instruction  Family Migration: Appendix
       FM Section 1.0b Family Life as a Partner or Parent and Private  Life:
       10 year routes at  11.2.3.  In  a  determination  promulgated  on  23
       January 2015, based on the visa processing  times  submitted  by  the
       Respondent, the Judge found that an out of country  application  made
       by the Appellant is more likely than not to be  processed  within  10
       days; that the decision in Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40  was  decided  on
       the particular facts of the case and well before the changes  in  the
       Immigration  Rules  and  the  current  emphasis  on  the   need   for
       immigration control; it would be in the best interests of Scarlett to
       remain with her parents in the UK because she is  used  to  a  family
       life in which both parents are present on a daily basis  and  it  was
       not disproportionate for the Appellant to  make  an  out  of  country
       application. Consequently he dismissed the appeal.

    5. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought  on  the  basis
       that the First Tier Tribunal reached a conclusion which was  contrary
       to Chikwamba; misunderstood and  misapplied  the  law  governing  the
       relevance of a parental relationship with a British child and made no
       findings  on  the  proportionality  of   refusing   the   Appellant's
       application because she had not overstayed.  This ground referred  to
       the  arguably  anomalous  provisions  of  E-LTRP.2.1  which  preclude
       'partner'  applications  being  made  by   visitors,   but   not   by
       overstayers. Permission to appeal was granted on 9 March 2015

       Submissions

    6. At the hearing on 11 May 2015, Mr Mackenzie submitted that there  was
       no dispute about the relationship or the existence  of  family  life.
       The application had been refused because the Appellant  came  to  the
       United Kingdom as a visitor and so could not rely on EX.1 of Appendix
       FM, which she would have been able to if she had been an  overstayer:
       this was perverse. In respect of the First  Tier  Tribunal's  finding
       that the Appellant can go back to  Hong  Kong  and  apply  for  entry
       clearance this was clearly contrary to the judgment of the  House  of
       Lords in Chikwamba. He further noted that there  was  extensive  case
       law post Chikwamba eg. MA (Pakistan) [2009] EWCA Civ 953 and  it  was
       clear that there needs to be a good reason to  expect  applicants  to
       return home. The only argument advanced  by  the  Respondent  at  the
       First-tier Tribunal hearing was that the Appellant  could  return  to
       obtain entry clearance but the key  point  is  that  it  is  for  the
       Respondent to identify why the Appellant should go back and it is for
       her to justify the  interference.  A  mere  failure  to  comply  with
       immigration control, which was not the case here, was not enough of a
       reason cf Lord Brown in Chikwamba.  In respect of the Judge's finding
       that an application would likely  be  processed  within  10  days  Mr
       Mackenzie submitted that it doesn't matter how  long  it  takes,  the
       Respondent has not discharged the burden of showing that it would  be
       reasonable for the Appellant to have  to  return  to  Hong  Kong.  He
       further disputed the finding  at  paragraph  22  that  Chikwamba  was
       decided on its particular facts:  the House of Lords  were  making  a
       point on the law.  There was nothing in the Rules  that  purports  to
       reverse Chikwamba. The  whole  premise  of  Chikwamba  was  that  the
       Respondent was simply  trying  to  rely  on  the  formal  process  of
       immigration control to defeat  a  substantively  well-founded  claim:
       this was found not to be sufficient. As  Lord  Justice  Sedley  makes
       clear in VW (Uganda) & AB (Somalia) [2009] EWCA Civ 5, it is a  false
       logic and is unsustainable.

    7. In respect of the application of section 117B of the NIAA 2002(6)  to
       the Appellant's British child, Mr Mackenzie submitted that the public
       interest does not require removal when a child is a  British  citizen
       and it is not reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the  UK.  He
       submitted that the policy at 11.2.3 of the IDI reflects the  decision
       in Sanade (British children - Zambrano - Dereci) [2011] UKUT 48 (IAC)
       albeit it is slightly narrower as the exceptions introduced there are
       not present in Sanade. However, there is nothing ambiguous about  the
       law: it is not reasonable to expect a British citizen child to  leave
       the United Kingdom. It had  not  been  suggested  that   any  of  the
       exceptions mentioned in the IDI apply in this  case.  In  respect  of
       section 117B(4) of the NIAA 2002 this does not refer to  family  life
       only private life, it does not refer to children  and  the  Appellant
       was not in the United Kingdom unlawfully and therefore, it was not  a
       precarious case. He further submitted that ZH (Tanzania) [2011]  UKSC
       4 was not distinguishable because Scarlett was a dual national:   you
       do not become less British just because you have another nationality.

    8. In response to a question from the Tribunal, Mr  Mackenzie  confirmed
       that Mr Chafen's current salary was in excess of  �68,000  per  annum
       and he had  previously  been  unable  to  meet  the  requirements  of
       Appendix FM as copy, instead of original, bank  statements  had  been
       submitted with the application. However, he  had  his  original  bank
       statements at the  hearing  before  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  which
       demonstrated that and had already  earned  over  �18,600  that  year,
       despite only having worked for 4 months.

    9. In response, Ms Isherwood submitted that there was no material  error
       of law in the decision of the First Tier Tribunal Judge. It had  been
       accepted that the Appellant did not meet  the  Rules.  She  submitted
       that this was not simply a Chikwamba case. What was being ignored was
       the case law from the Court of Appeal which says  that  the  starting
       point is the Immigration Rules.  She relied on paragraphs  29-31  of.
       Agyarko & others v SSHD (2015) EWCA Civ 440.   It  was  necessary  to
       look at the Immigration Rules  first  and  then,  in  a  'precarious'
       family  life  case,    consider   whether   there   are   exceptional
       circumstances. This was also the test set out in the policy document.
       She  further  submitted  that  the  refusal  letter  clearly   raises
       consideration of the policy and the issue of insurmountable obstacles
       and that the case law has moved on since the Sanade  concession.  The
       Appellant had options as her child has more than one citizenship: the
       refusal stated that both could go back or the Appellant could go back
       herself. The Home Office Presenting Officer provided the  information
       regarding visa processing time limits.  She  further  submitted  that
       this was a case where there was precarious family life:  Y  v  Russia
       [2010] 51 EHRR 21. The Appellant came to  the  United  Kingdom  in  a
       temporary capacity and there was an avenue available to  her  to  get
       appropriate entry clearance as a spouse. As the Court of Appeal  made
       clear in Huang (2007) UKHL 11 you cannot choose where  to  live  with
       your spouse. In respect of section 117B (6) she pointed out that Dube
       [2015] UKUT 90 (IAC) says it is necessary to  have  to  look  at  the
       whole Act in respect of the public interest.

   10. The Tribunal then asked Mr Mackenzie whether it might be thought that
       paragraph 11.2.3 of the policy and the Sanade concession  only  apply
       if you are expecting the British citizen or EEA national  to  go  and
       live in the third country, whereas  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge
       found that the Appellant (and Scarlett) would only be  going  for  10
       days:  given  that  limited  interference,  was  the   policy   still
       applicable? Mr Mackenzie submitted that  there  still  has  to  be  a
       justification for the interference and if there was no  justification
       it was not necessary to go on to consider proportionality. No  public
       interest had been identified in why they should return.  If  one  was
       identified then the Appellant may have had to give  reasons  why  she
       shouldn't return. The word used is  "leave"  not  "live  outside"  or
       "leave for a  substantial  period".  The  fact  that  there  were  no
       insurmountable  obstacles  was  not  a  reason  justifying  why   the
       Appellant and Scarlett  should  leave  the  United  Kingdom  and  the
       Respondent has not said what the public interest is.  In  respect  of
       the decision in Agyarko he  submitted  that  it  was  not  on  point:
       Agyarko was a decision taken before section 117B came into force  and
       there were no children. It was clear from 38 that this  covered  both
       situations where a relationship has been built up by someone  who  is
       here unlawfully and does not have children,  hence  the  emphasis  on
       precariousness, which was not the facts of this  case.  He  submitted
       that it is clear from the second sentence of paragraph 31 that  Sales
       LJ was not suggesting a departure from the principle in Chikwamba. He
       further submitted that SS Congo [2015] EWCA Civ 387 was also  dealing
       with the pre  section  117B  situation;  the  statute  clearly  takes
       precedence over the case law and  would  have  to  be  read  down  if
       inconsistent.

       Our Findings

   11. At the end of the hearing we  announced  our  decision  that,  having
       heard from both representatives, we were satisfied that the  decision
       contains errors of law such that it must be set  aside  and  that  we
       would re-make the decision by allowing it.

   12. Our reasons for so doing are as follows. By the time  of  the  appeal
       hearing in the First Tier Tribunal the Appellant met the  substantive
       requirements  of  the  Rules  in  respect  of  her  relationship  and
       suitability;  her sponsor's earnings were such that she did not  need
       to show "insurmountable obstacles" or that her  daughter's  departure
       from the United Kingdom would not be reasonable. Her only  difficulty
       was  that  she  did  not  have  the  appropriate   entry   clearance.
       Consequently, she had submitted that the House of Lords  judgment  in
       Chikwamba applied. The First-tier Tribunal rejected that argument  at
       paragraph 22 of the determination in the following terms:

             "Chikwamba was decided on the particular facts of the case and
             well before the changes  in  the  Immigration  Rules  and  the
             current emphasis on the need for immigration control. There is
             a  strong  public  policy  consideration  behind  the   policy
             requirement for an application for a spousal visa to  be  made
             from  abroad,  firstly  because  resources  are   concentrated
             overseas for the processing of such applications and  secondly
             because it discourages applications from entering as  visitors
             and then seeking to remain on a more  permanent  basis,  which
             undermines the robustness of the visitor route."

   13. Mr Mackenzie invited us to re-read the judgment in Chikwamba  and  we
       have done so. Lord Scott held at 6 that government  policy  requiring
       return in order to make an entry clearance  application  amounted  to
       dogma and at 4 that "policies  that  involve  people  cannot  be  and
       should not be allowed to become rigid, inflexible rules." At 44, Lord
       Brown considered  the  Respondent's  policy  at  that  time  and  its
       underlying rationale  and  found  that  "only  comparatively  rarely,
       certainly  in  family  cases  involving   children"   would   it   be
       proportionate and more appropriate for the  Appellant  to  apply  for
       leave from abroad. There had to be  good  reason  for  enforcing  the
       policy and there was none in that case.

   14. The judgment in Chikwamba has been followed in a number of cases:  in
       MA (Pakistan) [2009] EWCA Civ 953, Lord Justice Sullivan [at 7]  held
       that the principle was not confined  to  cases  where  children  were
       involved and [at 9] that: "the real question was  not  whether  there
       were  "insurmountable  obstacles:  to  the  applicant  returning   to
       Pakistan in order to make an application  for  entry  clearance  from
       there, but whether there was any sensible reason as to why he  should
       be required to do so"; in VW (Uganda) & AB (Somalia) [2009] EWCA  Civ
       5, Lord Justice Sedley referred to the Home Office  policy  prior  to
       Chikwamba as "false logic" and in Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
       Department v Treebhowan; Hayat v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
       Department [2012] EWCA 1054, Lord Justice Elias noted at 17 that: "it
       is true that enforcement of the policy is likely to  be  particularly
       futile where entry clearance will ultimately be granted because it is
       requiring a temporary disruption of family life for no good purpose."
       His Lordship then proceeded to  summarise  the  principles  distilled
       from the post Chikwamba jurisprudence and concluded  at  30(g)  that:
       "if the Secretary of State has no sensible reason for  requiring  the
       application to be made from the home state,  the  fact  that  he  has
       failed to do so  should  not  thereafter  carry  any  weight  in  the
       substantive Article 8 balancing exercise".  The principle was then  a
       clear one: in cases where the substantive requirements of  the  Rules
       are met the Secretary of  State  must  have  a  sensible  reason  for
       requiring family members to separate  in  order  to  go  through  the
       motions of applying for entry clearance.

   15.  However,  since  the  coming  into  force  of  the  changes  to  the
       Immigration Rules on 9 July 2012, the Respondent has reverted to  her
       previous policy position of asserting that an applicant needs to show
       insurmountable obstacles to  return  in  order  to  apply  for  entry
       clearance. The recent decision of Agyarko  was an appeal to the Court
       of Appeal  against  the  refusal  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  grant
       permission to apply for judicial review in a number of  linked  cases
       concerning overstayers who  had  formed  relationships  with  British
       citizens. At 31, Lord Justice Sales held  that  it  was  possible  to
       envisage a Chikwamba type case  arising  in  which  Article  8  might
       require that leave to remain be granted outside the Rules even though
       it could not be said that there were insurmountable obstacles to  the
       applicant and their spouse or partner continuing  their  family  life
       overseas, but  in  a  "precarious"  family  life  case  it  would  be
       necessary to establish that there were "exceptional circumstances" to
       warrant such a conclusion. Upper Tribunal Judge Gill reached the same
       conclusion in R (on the application of Chen) v Secretary of State for
       the Home Department (Appendix FM - Chikwamba - temporary separation -
       proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189  (IAC).  However,  these  were
       cases that did not involve children and where family  life  had  been
       formed at the time when  the  applicants  had  overstayed  and  could
       therefore be considered "precarious".   We do not consider  that  the
       decisions in Agyarko or Chen  materially  impinge  on  the  Chikwamba
       principle nor  could  have  been  intended  to  do  so.   Whilst  the
       Immigration  Rules  as  they   currently   stand   impose   mandatory
       requirements and were intended to represent a "complete code", we  do
       not consider that the imposition of  an  "exceptional  circumstances"
       requirement for an  application  to  succeed  outside  the  Rules  on
       Article 8 grounds is a freestanding provision but must  be  read  and
       interpreted  alongside   both   the   pre-existing   and   developing
       jurisprudence of the higher Courts.  Even if these decisions  are  to
       be given the reading for which Ms Isherwood contends, we note that in
       this case the family life - between mother, father and  child  -  was
       established when  the  family  were  living  in  Hong  Kong  and  was
       therefore in no way "precarious" at its  inception.   We  doubt  that
       such a bond can become "precarious", and so de-valued  in  Article  8
       terms,  because  the  mother  has  been  granted  a  visitors   visa.
       Furthermore the fact that there is a child involved has  itself  been
       identified as an "exceptional" factor: see Jeunesse v Netherlands [at
       118-119], acknowledged in Agyarko [at 33].

   16. Whilst "insurmountable obstacles" is the test set out  in  EX1(b)  of
       Appendix FM of the Rules, the Upper  Tribunal  have  reiterated  that
       this  is  not  a  conclusive  test  in  respect  of  an   Article   8
       consideration outside the Rules: see Izuazu (Article 8 -  new  rules)
       [2013] UKUT 00045 (IAC) [at 58] and Agyarko [at 31]. Consequently, we
       are satisfied that the Respondent erred in stopping at this test  and
       so did the First Tier Tribunal. Chikwamba  is  a  judgment  from  the
       House of Lords and has been followed  and  applied  on  a  number  of
       occasions by the Court of Appeal, as set out  above.    As  such  the
       Appellant was entitled to rely upon it.

   17. We also find that the First Tier Tribunal Judge materially  erred  at
       24 and 27 of his determination in respect  of  his  analysis  of  the
       relevance of Scarlett's British nationality to the proportionality of
       the Respondent's decision. As the policy "Appendix  FM  Section  1.0b
       Family Life as a Partner or Parent and Private Life: 10  year  route"
       at 11.2.3 makes clear, it is only where the conduct of  a  parent  or
       primary carer gives rise to  considerations  of  such  weight  as  to
       justify separation, if the child could otherwise  stay  with  another
       parent in the United Kingdom  or  European  Union,  that  it  may  be
       appropriate to  refuse  to  grant  leave.  Examples  of  the  conduct
       envisaged include criminality or a  very  poor  immigration  history,
       neither of which are applicable in this case. It is also incumbent on
       the decision maker to  consider  the  impact  on  the  child  of  any
       separation. In this case, the First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge  expressly
       accepted at  paragraph  23  that  it  would  be  in  Scarlett's  best
       interests to remain with her parents in the United Kingdom  but  then
       at 24 found that her parents would have to  choose  whether  Scarlett
       would remain in the United Kingdom with her father or return to  Hong
       Kong with her mother, apparently in contradiction of  his finding  in
       respect of Scarlett's best interests. He further  found  at  24  that
       because Scarlett  is  a  dual  national  there  was  nothing  in  the
       Respondent's decision which offends the principles set out in Sanade.
       We remind ourselves that the Secretary of State's concession in  that
       case was based on  the  fact  that  the  child  was  a  British,  and
       therefore European,  citizen.  The  fact  that  Scarlett  also  holds
       Chinese nationality cannot properly detract from the  requirement  to
       consider her best interests as a British child residing in the United
       Kingdom, and EEA:  Sanade  and  ZH  (Tanzania)  [2011]  UKSC  4.  The
       question pursuant to section 117B(6)(b) of the NIAA 2002 was  whether
       it was reasonable to expect Scarlett to leave the United Kingdom.  In
       our view, it was not reasonable to expect her  to  leave  the  United
       Kingdom nor, given her young age (she is 4 years  old)  would  it  be
       reasonable for her to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  without  her
       mother, who is her primary carer. We endorse the First Tier  Tribunal
       Judge's finding at 23 that it would  be  in  her  best  interests  to
       remain in the United Kingdom with both her parents.

   18. For those reasons  we  find  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal contains errors of law such that it must be set  aside,  and
       we re-make the decision by allowing it.

       Decisions

   19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains errors of law and it
       is set aside.

   20. We re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it on human  rights
       grounds.

   21. We were not asked to make a direction for anonymity and on the  facts
       see no reason to do so.
