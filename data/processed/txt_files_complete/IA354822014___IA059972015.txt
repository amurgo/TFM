                                                                 Respondents


For the Appellant:     Mrs H. Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Ms E. Norman, Counsel instructed by Jacobs Law
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Mrs Marie [E] is a national of Jamaica born on the 4th September  1970.



 2. The Secretary of State has been trying to deport her for some time.  On
    the 11th February 2014 she was convicted of supplying crack cocaine,  a
    Class A controlled drug. She was sent to prison for 18  months.   As  a
    result of  that  conviction  she  was  notified  of  her  liability  to
    deportation under section 32(5) of the United Kingdom Borders Act 2007,
    and an order signed, on the 19th March 2014.

 3. Twice the First-tier Tribunal has allowed, on human rights grounds, her
    appeal against that decision. Twice the Secretary of State has appealed
    to the Upper Tribunal, and twice have the decisions of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal been set aside, most recently by Upper Tribunal Judge Allen in
    his decision dated the 8th November 2018.  The matter comes  before  me
    for 're-making' pursuant to the transfer order of Upper Tribunal  Judge
    O'Connor dated the 13th November 2018.

 4. Mr David [E] is a national of Jamaica born on the 30th March  1961.  He
    finds himself before this Tribunal for no reason other  than  the  fact
    that he is married to Mrs [E],  and  his  status  in  this  country  is
    dependent upon hers.




    The Legal Framework

 5.  The  legal  framework  to  be  applied  in  these  linked  appeals  is
    uncontroversial.

 6. Mrs [E] is, by reason of her criminal conviction, liable  to  automatic
    deportation: s32(5) Borders Act 2007.  She  can  succeed  in  resisting
    deportation if she can show that any of the exceptions in section 33 of
    the Borders Act 2007 apply.   That section contains 6 exceptions,  only
    one of which is potentially engaged on the facts: s33 (2)(a), that  her
    deportation would breach her Convention rights,  that  is  to  say  her
    rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.

 7. Mrs [E] relies on Article 8, submitting that her deportation would be a
    disproportionate interference with both her private and family life  in
    the United Kingdom. Because she seeks to rely on Article 8 I must  have
    regard to the provisions in respect of the public interest set  out  in
    s117C of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002:

         '(1)     The deportation of foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.

         (2)      The more  serious  the  offence  committed  by  a  foreign
         criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation of  the
         criminal.

         (3)      In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,  the
         public interest requires C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
         Exception 2 applies.

         (4)      Exception 1 applies where-

             (a) C has been lawfully resident in  the  United  Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,

             (b) C is socially and  culturally  integrated  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and

             (c)  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles   to   C's
             integration into the country to which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported.

         (5)      Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

         (6)      In the case of a foreign criminal who has  been  sentenced
         to a period of imprisonment of at  least  four  years,  the  public
         interest requires deportation  unless  there  are  very  compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2.

         (7)      The considerations in subsections (1) to  (6)  are  to  be
         taken into account where a  court  or  tribunal  is  considering  a
         decision to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent  that  the
         reason for the decision was the offence or offences for  which  the
         criminal has been convicted.'

 8. It is not contended that Mrs [E] can meet  'exception  1'  set  out  at
    s117C(4). Although she has lived in the United Kingdom with leave since
    2000 she spent the preceding 30 years living in Jamaica.  She  has  not
    therefore been lawfully resident here for most of her life. Nor can she
    meet 'exception 2', which relates to  family  members,  since  she  has
    neither a qualifying partner or minor children in the  United  Kingdom.
    By operation of sub-section (3) it would therefore seem that her  claim
    was prima facie defeated:

         '(3)     In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,  the
         public interest requires C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
         Exception 2 applies.'

    If statute provides that the public interest requires her  deportation,
    that would arguably be the end of the matter.

 9. Not so, say the  Court  of  Appeal.   In  NA  (Pakistan)  &  Another  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  662  the
    Court noted the apparent lacuna in s117C  in  respect  of  persons  who
    receive a sentence of less than 4 years but like Mrs [E], cannot  bring
    themselves within one of the exceptions. Unlike criminals sentenced  to
    four years, whose position is covered by s117C(6), the statute does not
    set out any framework for consideration of their Article 8 claims. From
    paragraph 24 of NA Lord Justice Jackson puts it like this:

          1. A curious feature of section 117C(3) is that it does not  make
             any provision for medium offenders who fall outside Exceptions
             1 and 2. One would have expected that sub-section to say  that
             they too can escape deportation if "there are very  compelling
             circumstances, over and above Exceptions 1 and 2". It would be
             bizarre in the extreme if  the  statute  gave  this  right  to
             serious offenders, but not to medium  offenders.  Furthermore,
             the new rule 398 (which came into force on  the  same  day  as
             section 117C) proceeds on the basis that medium  offenders  do
             have this right.

          1. Something has  obviously  gone  amiss  with  the  drafting  of
             section  117C(3).  In Inco  Europe  Ltd   v   First   Choice
             Distribution [2000] 1 WLR 586, HL, at 592-593, Lord  Nicholls
             (with whom  the  other  members  of  the  Appellate  Committee
             agreed) explained the circumstances in  which  the  courts  in
             interpreting statutes can correct obvious drafting errors.  In
             our view the lacuna in section 117C(3) is an obvious  drafting
             error. Parliament must have intended medium offenders to  have
             the same fall back protection as  serious  offenders.  Mr  Tam
             invited us so to rule.

          1. In reaching this conclusion it is important to  bear  in  mind
             that the new Part 5A of the 2002 Act is framed in such  a  way
             as to provide  a  structured  basis  for  application  of  and
             compliance with Article 8, rather than to disapply it: see the
             title of Part 5A, the general scheme of the provisions in that
             Part and, in particular,  section  117A(1).  If  section  117C
             barred medium offenders from asserting  any  Article  8  claim
             other than provided for in subsections (4) and (5), that would
             plainly be incompatible with Article 8  rights  (either  their
             own or Convention rights of individuals in  their  family)  in
             some cases. Equally plainly, it was not Parliament's intention
             in enacting Part  5A  to  disapply  or  require  violation  of
             Article 8 in any case. We also place reliance on section  3(1)
             of the Human Rights Act 1998. That provision  requires  courts
             to construe legislation in a  way  which  is  compatible  with
             Convention rights, if it is possible to do so. It is  possible
             to do so here. In accordance with the guidance given  by  Lord
             Nicholls, the words which need to be read into section 117C(3)
             so as properly to reflect Parliament's true meaning are clear,
             namely the same words as appear  in  sub-section  (6)  and  in
             para. 398 of the 2014 rules, which came  into  effect  at  the
             same time as part  of  an  integrated  and  coherent  code  in
             primary legislation and the Immigration Rules for dealing with
             deportation cases.

          1. For all these reasons we shall proceed on the basis that  fall
             back protection of the kind stated in section  117C(6)  avails
             both (a) serious offenders and (b) medium offenders  who  fall
             outside Exceptions 1  and  2.  On  a  proper  construction  of
             section 117C(3), it provides that for  medium  offenders  "the
             public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or
             Exception 2  applies  or  unless  there  are  very  compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1
             and 2.

10. Before me the parties agreed that the NA interpretation  of  s117C  was
    the framework I must apply. I must therefore consider whether there are
    "very compelling circumstances,  over  and  above  those  described  in
    exceptions 1 and 2" in Mrs  [E]  case.    Of  this  test  Lord  Justice
    Jackson underlined the high threshold to be met when he said this:

          2.  Although  there  is  no  'exceptionality'   requirement,   it
             inexorably follows from the statutory scheme that the cases in
             which circumstances are sufficiently  compelling  to  outweigh
             the high public interest in  deportation  will  be  rare.  The
             commonplace incidents of family life, such as  ageing  parents
             in poor  health  or  the  natural  love  between  parents  and
             children, will not be sufficient.

11. There has been some delay in the making of this decision, at  least  in
    part because I was awaiting the decision of  a  Presidential  panel  of
    this Tribunal (Lane J, Upper Tribunal Judges Coker and Gill) addressing
    the matter of how the test "very compelling  circumstances"  should  be
    interpreted. That decision is  now  available:   MS  (s.117C(6):  "very
    compelling circumstances") Philippines [2019] UKUT 00122 (IAC). In  the
    end I have not considered it necessary to revert  to  the  parties  for
    further submissions, since the  conclusions  of  the  panel  about  the
    proper legal approach accorded in substance with the  position  adopted
    by the parties, that being:

          1) In determining pursuant to section 117C(6) of the Nationality,
             Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  whether  there  are  very
             compelling circumstances, over and above  those  described  in
             Exceptions 1 and 2 in subsections (4)  and  (5),  such  as  to
             outweigh the public interest in the deportation of  a  foreign
             criminal, a court or tribunal must take into account, together
             with any other relevant public  interest  considerations,  the
             seriousness of the particular offence  of  which  the  foreign
             criminal  was  convicted;  not  merely  whether  the   foreign
             criminal was or was not sentenced to imprisonment of more than
             4 years. Nothing in KO (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for  the
             Home Department [2018] UKSC 53 demands a contrary conclusion.

          2) There is nothing in Hesham Ali v Secretary of  State  for  the
             Home Department [2016]  UKSC  60  that  requires  a  court  or
             tribunal to eschew the principle of public deterrence,  as  an
             element of the public interest, in determining  a  deportation
             appeal by reference to section 117C(6).

12. Mr [E] is not a criminal.  He appeals the decision of the Secretary  of
    State dated the 28th January 2015 to refuse to grant him further  leave
    to remain as the spouse of Mrs [E].  Mr [E]  previously  had  leave  in
    this capacity, and in December 2014  made  an  in-time  application  to
    extend such leave.  his was refused on the grounds that Mrs [E] had, by
    virtue of the deportation order, lost her settled status, since her ILR
    was revoked.  The parties before me therefore agreed  that  his  appeal
    was entirely dependent on his wife's: if she succeeds, so shall he.




    The Factual Matrix

13. Mrs [E] has lived in this country since December 2000 when she  arrived
    with leave to enter as visitor. She subsequently varied that  leave  so
    as to be granted leave as student, and  then  as  a  spouse.   She  was
    granted indefinite leave to remain in 2006. It is therefore accepted by
    the Secretary of State that Mrs [E] had valid leave to enter or  remain
    from the time of her arrival until the day that the  deportation  order
    was signed in  2014.   For  the  sake  of  completeness,  Mrs  [E]  now
    acknowledges  that  a  previous  assertion  by  her  to  have  had   an
    entitlement to British nationality was without merit, that  application
    having been made after receiving legal advice that was not just  flawed
    but criminally fraudulent: I understand that Mrs  [E]  is  now  seeking
    redress with the relevant authorities in respect of that matter.

14. Mrs [E] was arrested on the  11th  July  2013  in  connection  with  an
    investigation into the distribution and supply of crack  cocaine.   The
    circumstances leading to her arrest and  charge  are  set  out  in  her
    uncontested witness statement. They were as follows. In  2002  her  son
    [SR] arrived from Jamaica as a visitor, and remained here. [SR] is  Mrs
    Edward's only son, and in her own words, she was "often manipulated" by
    him. He became involved in dealing drugs.  He was caught, and  sent  to
    prison.  In January 2012 Mrs [E] went to visit him. He asked her if she
    would do something for him. She was to telephone his friend and ask him
    how many "brown ladies" there were, and how many "white  ladies"  there
    were. The friend told Mrs [E] that there was one of each.  She  relayed
    this information to her son on her next visit to prison.  It turned out
    that this was code for drugs: white ladies were  crack  cocaine,  brown
    ladies heroin. On another occasion her son telephoned her and asked her
    if she could give him her bank details so that a friend  of  his  could
    pay him some money he owed him into her  account.  She  supplied  those
    details and a total of �200 was paid into her account.  The sum of �185
    was also delivered to her at her home. She paid all of  this  money  to
    her son.  These were the matters that led the police to attend  at  her
    home with a warrant for her arrest.

15. Mrs [E] avers that whilst she  was  being  held  at  Shrewsbury  Police
    Station she received legal advice from a man  named  Hamar  Chiles.  He
    told her that as a black woman she would not  receive  justice  in  the
    English justice system. He told her that if she fought the charges  and
    was convicted, she would be sent to prison for 6 years. He advised  her
    to plead guilty. She was remanded into custody.   At  the  age  of  42,
    having been of previous good character,  a  professional  carer  and  a
    devout  Christian,  Mrs  [E]  suddenly  found  herself  in  prison,  an
    experience she describes as "terrifying". Her body and mind went into a
    "state of shock". She tried to kill herself on a number  of  occasions:
    "I couldn't cope with the situation I was in; the  most  painful  thing
    was that my son, my only child, had done this to me".  Afraid that  she
    would spend the next five years in jail she therefore decided to  plead
    guilty. She was sentenced to 18 months on the 7th February 2014, having
    already spent 164 days on remand.

16. Mrs Edward's son [SR] has now been deported to Jamaica.

17. Mrs [E] recognises the legal framework as it is summarised  above.   It
    is submitted on her behalf that there are in her case "very  compelling
    circumstances"  such  that  the  substantial  public  interest  in  her
    deportation is outweighed. These are, cumulatively, that :

          i) She has a period of 18 years continuous residence during which
             she has established a strong private life; and

         ii) Fourteen of those years were with lawful leave; and

        iii) She is extremely ill; and

         iv) She is of previous good character; and

          v) The Judge at her criminal trial accepted that  she  was  na�ve
             and manipulated by her son; and

         vi)  She is unfit to travel; and

        vii)  She is effectively housebound and extremely unlikely to  ever
             offend again.

18. Mrs Aboni did  not  dispute  that  Mr  and  Mrs  [E]  have  established
    meaningful private lives in the United Kingdom. The evidence  indicates
    that Mrs [E] has lived here since 2000, and that she has nothing and no-
    one in Jamaica apart from  her  criminal  son  from  whom  she  is  now
    estranged. Her mother, aunt, sisters and cousins are all living in  the
    United Kingdom. In addition to Mrs [E]'s  own  statement  I  have  been
    provided with signed statements by her mother,  Mrs  [YL],  her  sister
    [KT], her cousin [KW] and her aunt [MM]. All three witnesses attest  to
    the close and supportive family network in this  country,  and  to  the
    fact that prior to her conviction and  illness,  Mrs  [E]  was  a  law-
    abiding and hardworking member of the community.  These family  members
    also allude to the challenges that she faced in dealing  with  her  son
    [SR].  The bundle also contains several heartfelt character  references
    from people who know Mrs [E] from church, including Father  John  Reid,
    the Parish Priest of St Mary's Priory,  who  describes  Mrs  [E]  as  a
    "courteous, selfless person  of  integrity,  moral  goodness  and  deep
    faith".

19. Mr [E] has lived in this country since 2012. He also has  a  number  of
    close family members living in the United Kingdom, including  brothers,
    nephews and nieces. He also has one son who lives in Jamaica.  Both  Mr
    and Mrs [E] were regular church-goers until Mrs [E] became housebound.

20. The Secretary of State accepts that Mrs [E] is extremely unwell. In his
    determination dated the 16th November 2017  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Chohan summarises her condition as follows:

         "The first appellant  suffers  from  poor  health.   She  has  been
         diagnosed as suffering from asthma, problems of the  thyroid  gland
         and high blood pressure.  However, the most  serious  illness  that
         the   appellant   suffers    from    is    a    condition    called
         Lymphangioleimyomatosis  (LAM).   This  is  a  rare  disease  which
         affects women.   Cysts  form  in  the  lungs,  causing  significant
         airflow obstruction and impairment of gas transfer, which  requires
         the first appellant to use supplemental oxygen for most of the day.
          The first appellant is on an experimental treatment  with  a  drug
         called Rapamycin.  The first appellant is under the  care  of  Prof
         Simon Johnson at Nottingham University Hospital.  Indeed, it is the
         only  hospital  in  the  United  Kingdom,  which  deals  with  this
         particular disease."

21.  I  have  before  me  correspondence  from  the   University   Hospital
    Birmingham, which confirms that Mrs [E] is currently  being  prescribed
    at least 17 different medicines, for a variety of conditions  including
    LAM.  These letters and reports  also  confirm  that  Mrs  [E]  is  now
    dependent  upon  ambulatory  oxygen  canisters  to  assist   with   her
    breathing.   They also reveal that in addition to breathing problems, a
    further symptom of LAM is tumours on the kidneys. Due to  her  lack  of
    mobility Mrs [E] has also been diagnosed with Deep Vein  Thrombosis  in
    her axillary, brachial and basilic veins.  Several  of  the  very  many
    medical documents  before  me  indicate  that  as  a  result  of  these
    cumulative conditions Mrs [E] is not fit to travel.   This  includes  a
    letter written by her GP on the 8th January 2016 to confirm that due to
    her deteriorating lung function she is not fit to fly as she would  not
    be able to tolerate a long distance flight.  Mrs Aboni accepted that in
    light of the available material indicating this to be  a  deteriorating
    and irreversible lung condition it is  not  likely  that  this  medical
    opinion would have changed.  In a letter dated 12th July 2017 Professor
    Johnson,  Mrs  [E]'  supervising  clinician,   describes   her   as   a
    "particularly complex case", and  expresses  doubt  about  whether  she
    would be able to obtain any effective treatment in  Jamaica.  Rapamycin
    is an unlicensed therapy and is being administered on a trial basis  in
    the United Kingdom's dedicated LAM unit.

22. In terms of the day-to-day effects that LAM has on Mrs [E] I  have  had
    regard to the statement of Mr [E] dated 4 September  2017.   He  states
    that in order to survive his wife takes  over  200  tablets  per  week,
    including morphine to combat the excruciating chest pain that she often
    suffers.   I have further been referred to the 'Home Care Support Plan'
    put in place by the agency who are charged with providing personal care
    to Mrs [E] in her home. This confirms that Mr Edward's is  the  primary
    carer for his wife who suffers from "lung disease, kidney  failure  and
    has had three mini strokes in  August  2015".    The  plan  shows  that
    carers attend the family home seven days a week, twice each  day.  They
    come in the morning for an hour to assist her in getting  out  of  bed,
    washing and attend to her personal care. They come back in the  evening
    for another 45 minutes to again attend to personal care  and  help  Mrs
    [E] get ready for bed.

23. Mrs [E] maintains that there is  no  treatment  available  for  LAM  in
    Jamaica. She has produced fact sheet produced by charity  'LAM  Action'
    which contains a list of clinics worldwide where the condition  can  be
    treated.  There are none in the Caribbean.   She  further  produced  on
    online article about the general healthcare available in Jamaica.  This
    states that although every parish  has  at  least  one  small  hospital
    offering free medical care this  is  generally  of  poor  quality.  The
    system suffers from 'brain drain' with the  most  qualified  clinicians
    choosing  to  work  abroad.  Public  hospitals  are   underfunded   and
    overcrowded. Mrs Edward's GP writes that the Nottingham Centre  is  the
    only specialist centre in the United Kingdom and "no such treatment  is
    available in Jamaica".  Ms Norman was unable to  tell  me  how  the  GP
    might know that to be the case, but she  did  point  out  that  if  the
    Nottingham Centre is the only  specialist  centre  here,  and  the  LAM
    Action material did not show a clinic in Jamaica, it was safe to assume
    that the GP was correct.

24. As to the matter of rehabilitation, it was Mrs  [E]'  case  that  until
    February 2014 she had never been convicted before, and  she  has  never
    been convicted since.




    Discussion and Findings

25. As I have set out  above,  it  is  for  Mrs  [E]  to  demonstrate  that
    notwithstanding that it is strongly in the public  interest  to  deport
    her, she should nevertheless be permitted to remain  in  this  country,
    because there are in her case "very compelling circumstances  over  and
    above" the exceptions set out at s117C.  The  parties  agreed  that  in
    determining whether a factor or a collection  of  factors  takes  these
    circumstances "over and above" a breach of Article 8  (as  codified  in
    the 'exceptions') I am looking for a personal  consequence  of  greater
    adverse impact than a  'standard'  disproportionate  interference  with
    family or private life rights. That is to say, the consequences for the
    individuals concerned must be very serious indeed.  In her case,  those
    consequences must be of sufficient severity to outweigh the substantial
    public interest in deporting an individual who has become  involved  in
    the distribution of Class A drugs.

26. I am certainly satisfied that Mrs [E]  has  an  established  Article  8
    private life in this country. I note that  despite  having  pursued  an
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal on  GS  (India)  grounds,  before  me  the
    Respondent also accepted this to be the case. That being so, it  cannot
    be said that Mrs [E]' case rests solely on her medical condition. It is
    one part of her case, and a factor upon which  she  asks  me  to  place
    considerable weight, but it is not the only element of Article 8, which
    on the facts was engaged long before she became ill, or indeed became a
    criminal.   Mrs [E] had always, until her deportation order was signed,
    had valid leave to be in this country.  From  2006  on  her  leave  was
    indefinite and it is unsurprising that with such  leave  Mrs  [E]  felt
    secure  in  going  about  her   business,   making   friends,   forming
    relationships, having a job, attending church, establishing a home  and
    generally  integrating  into  the  community.   I   accept   that   her
    relationships here include Article 8  relationships  with  her  mother,
    sister and other relatives.   I therefore attach what weight I  can  to
    that Article 8 family and private life. I note  however  that  whatever
    significance Mrs [E] may have attached to  the  word  "indefinite"  her
    leave was, as subsequent events have demonstrated, in fact  precarious.
     I  am  further  satisfied,  and  indeed  Mrs  Aboni  did  not  suggest
    otherwise, that Mr [E] has established a meaningful private life in the
    seven years that he has lived in this country.

27. I am satisfied that the deportation of the Appellants  would  interfere
    with their Article 8 rights and that Article 8 is therefore engaged.

28. I am satisfied that the decision to deport Mrs [E] and to refuse  leave
    to Mr [E] was properly taken  by  the  Respondent  in  pursuit  of  the
    legitimate Article 8(2) aim of preventing disorder or crime.

29.  The  question  remains  whether  the  Respondent's  decisions  are   a
    proportionate  response  to  that  aim.   I  begin  my  assessment   of
    proportionality by considering the nature of the offence and why it  is
    so strongly in the public interest that Mrs [E] be  removed  from  this
    country.

30. Class A drugs, specifically crack and heroin, are so obvious a  scourge
    it needs little elaboration.  As well as bringing misery and ill-health
    to the lives of their users these drugs cause a ripple effect  of  harm
    that reaches far and wide into society. For  instance,  family  members
    are left behind by addicts who die; habits are funded by  the  proceeds
    of crime such as burglary and  street  robbery,  events  which  are  in
    themselves frightening and traumatic; the trafficking of narcotics  can
    invariably be traced to organised crime and in turn other  crimes  such
    as trafficking in persons;  the cost to the taxpayer, through policing,
    the  criminal  justice  system,  social  services,  the  NHS  and  drug
    treatment centres is huge.  Having assessed the evidence, I am able  to
    accept without hesitation Mrs [E]' claim to have  been  na�ve,  and  to
    some extent to have been manipulated by her son.  I  also  accept  that
    her guilty plea largely resulted from her being  terrified  of  a  long
    sentence.  I am not however  prepared  to  accept  that  she  was  'not
    guilty', or that she necessarily would  have  been  acquitted  had  she
    fought the charge. The terms used in the telephone call  were  patently
    obvious code for drugs, and I am satisfied that no matter how na�ve she
    might have been, Mrs [E] did not think that she was actually asking her
    son's friend whether he had "brown ladies" at his house.  That said, it
    was plain from the circumstances of the offence that Mrs [E] was not  a
    habitual crack-dealer.  I accept that her involvement was  limited  and
    stemmed from his misplaced devotion to her son;  that  this  is  so  is
    reflected in the relatively low sentence she received.

31. Another factor to which I must give significant weight is the  need  to
    deter criminality through the  consistent  enforcement  of  immigration
    control.  In MS (Philippines) the President of this Tribunal underlined
    that this continues to be an  important  consideration  in  deportation
    appeals, notwithstanding how the remarks of Lord Wilson in Hesham Ali v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2016]  UKSC  60  might  be
    interpreted:

         "Importantly, Hesham Ali contains no analysis of  Part  5A  of  the
         2002 Act, since  the  cases  with  which  the  Supreme  Court  were
         concerned pre-dated the introduction of  that  Part.   We  consider
         that, by making the seriousness of the offence the  touchstone  for
         determining the strength of the  public  interest  in  deportation,
         Parliament, in enacting section 117C(2), must have intended  courts
         and tribunals to have regard to more  than  the  mere  question  of
         whether the particular foreign criminal, if allowed  to  remain  in
         the United Kingdom, would pose a risk to United Kingdom society.

         In any event, it  is  clear  from  paragraphs  69  and  70  of  the
         judgments in Hesham Ali that Lord Wilson did not intend  to  resile
         from the view  that  the  general  deterrent  effect  upon  foreign
         citizens "of understanding that a  serious  offence  will  normally
         precipitate their deportation [might] be a more powerful aid to the
         prevention of crime than the removal from the  UK  of  one  foreign
         criminal judged as likely to  re-offend"  (paragraph  69).   As  is
         evident from paragraph 70, in accepting Lord  Kerr's  criticism  of
         what Lord Wilson had said in OH (Serbia), Lord Wilson was doing  no
         more than accepting that his categorisation of the  matter  "as  an
         expression of  society's  revulsion  at  serious  crimes"  was  "on
         reflection, too emotive a concept  to  figure  in  this  analysis".
         There is also the point that the majority of the Justices who  took
         part in Hesham Ali had nothing to say on these issues.

32. Although this is a case pursued  on  'criminality'  grounds  alone  Mrs
    Aboni further asked me to weigh in the balance the fact that Mrs [E] is
    likely to be costing the NHS a large amount of money: this was  one  of
    the GS (India) points pursued in the Secretary of  State's  grounds  to
    the Upper Tribunal. Of course, there is no question of Mrs [E] being  a
    'health tourist'; but for the  deportation  proceedings  she  would  be
    entitled to the care she currently receives on the NHS. Nevertheless it
    is one factor and I weigh it in the balance.

33. Against these matters I weigh the following.  It is not in dispute that
    prior to her conviction Mrs [E] was of good character, and  that  since
    that conviction in February 2014 there has been no  further  offending.
    Now that she is housebound, dependent upon an oxygen cannister and more
    importantly entirely estranged from her son, I find that the  prospects
    of her ever offending again to  be  effectively  non-existent.   It  is
    further accepted that Mrs [E] has lived in this country  a  long  time,
    and that until she was served with the deportation order  every  single
    day of it was with leave to be here. I accept and  find  as  fact  that
    over the past 18 years  Mrs  [E]  has  established  a  deep-rooted  and
    meaningful private life with  friends,  close  family  members,  fellow
    congregants in her church and in her local community.

34. That is a private life that will, now, be very  difficult  for  her  to
    replicate in Jamaica.  She is housebound in this country, and  so,  the
    medical evidence overwhelmingly indicates, would she be in Jamaica.  In
    this country however she has the benefit of regular visitors, including
    her mother, sister, cousin, aunt,  parish  priest  and  friends.  These
    people play an important role in breaking up Mrs [E]'  day,  supporting
    her through her  very  challenging  and  debilitating  illness  and  in
    providing her with some social stimulation.  There are  no  immediately
    obvious candidates for such a role in Jamaica. The only  family  member
    there is [SR], with whom she has no contact.  Given  the  very  fraught
    family history I cannot think that  any  such  contact,  should  it  be
    resumed, would be helpful to, or welcomed by, Mr and Mrs [E].

35. The day to day reality of return to Jamaica is, I accept, likely to  be
    stark. At present Mrs [E] benefits  not  just  from  twice  daily  care
    visits  for  'personal  care'  and  the  like,  but  from  the  medical
    intervention of a multi-disciplinary  care  team  specialising  in  her
    rare, serious and relatively little understood disease.  Whilst  it  is
    true that her main carer, her husband, is going to go with her,  it  is
    difficult to see how he will be able to cope without the input  of  the
    professional carers and clinicians who currently help him to look after
    his wife.  Without friends  and  family,  professional  carers  or  the
    presence of doctors able to deal with this "particularly complex  case"
    of LAM, I find it likely that Mr [E] would be unable  to  maintain  the
    basic, albeit diminished, level of  dignity  that  his  wife  currently
    enjoys.

36. Mrs [E] is currently taking approximately 200 tablets per  week,  of  a
    total of some 17 different medications. It may be that some,  or  many,
    of these would be available in Jamaica, as no  doubt  would  ambulatory
    oxygen. It is however clear from the medical evidence  before  me  that
    there would be virtually no prospect of her being able  to  obtain  the
    main drug that is currently being used, on an  experimental  basis,  to
    treat her LAM: Professor Johnson's clear evidence is that Rapamycin  is
    unlicensed and is only currently prescribed  by  his  specialist  unit.
    The primary symptoms of LAM mentioned in the medical evidence are cysts
    on  the  lung  which  obstruct  breathing  (eventually  preventing   it
    altogether), tumours on the kidneys and deep vein thrombosis; I further
    note from the care records that Mrs [E] has already suffered  a  series
    of mini-strokes.  The reality is that  this  is  a  disease  that  will
    likely kill her wherever she lives. The difference between her death in
    Jamaica, and her death here, is that in this country she will have  the
    greatest prospect of her final years being  pain  free,  dignified  and
    supported.

37. I further place some weight, although I stress that it was minimal,  on
    the fact that Mrs [E] has already paid  a  very  heavy  price  for  her
    criminality. Most if not all foreign criminals facing deportation  will
    have been to jail, and that factor cannot, self-evidently,  negate  the
    weight to be attached to the public interest in deporting them.  It  is
    however relevant to note that Mrs [E] went into a "state of shock" when
    she  was  sent  to  prison:  her  unchallenged  evidence  is  that  her
    incarceration led to a very serious, rapid and prolonged decline in her
    mental health, leading to more than one suicide attempt.  No doubt more
    painful for her is her betrayal by, and  estrangement  from,  her  only
    son.

38. Having considered all of the above I am satisfied,  that  in  the  very
    particular circumstances of this case, the facts cumulatively  assessed
    are sufficiently compelling to outweigh the high public interest in the
    deportation of Mrs [E].  I need make no separate finding about Mr  [E],
    since  the  Secretary  of  State  accepts   that   if   it   would   be
    disproportionate to deport her, then it would  be  disproportionate  to
    remove, or refuse leave to, Mr [E].

39. I underline as a postscript to my decision the  medical  evidence  that
    Mrs [E] is not fit to travel, and the fact that she is very unlikely to
    be so in the future. I have had no regard to that matter in my decision
    making: I have treated it as a 'technical obstacle  to  return'  rather
    than a factor capable  of  weighing  against  the  public  interest  in
    deportation. It is nevertheless obviously a factor that  the  Secretary
    of State would wish to take into account in any future decisions  about
    her case.




    Decisions

    appeal on human rights grounds". There is no order for anonymity.


    [pic]  Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce
                                 25th May 2019
