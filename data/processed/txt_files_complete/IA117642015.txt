Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mrs T K Zahoor of Prestige Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This is an appeal by the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
   against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  Mr  Saleem's
   appeal against the respondent's decision to refuse  his  application  for
   leave to remain as a spouse.

2. For the purposes of this decision,  I  shall  hereinafter  refer  to  the
   Secretary of State as the respondent and  Mr  Saleem  as  the  appellant,
   reflecting their positions as they were in the appeal before  the  First-
   tier Tribunal.

3. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 15 June 1988.  He  entered
   the United Kingdom with entry clearance  as  a  student  valid  until  15
   November 2011 and was subsequently granted periods of leave to remain  as
   a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant until 30 January 2015.


4. On 28 January 2015 the  appellant  applied  for  leave  to  remain  as  a
   spouse. His application was refused on 10 March 2015 on the basis that he
   had failed to produce satisfactory evidence to show that  he  could  meet
   the financial requirements in E-LTRP 3.1. The respondent considered  that
   the appellant had provided satisfactory evidence to show that he and  his
   wife were employed by S & S (Manchester) Ltd. The respondent  noted  that
   the appellant had provided employer's letters, wage slips dated from July
   2014 to December 2014 and bank statements for himself and his  wife.  The
   respondent noted further that the payslips showed a  combined  income  of
   �21,629.40. However between July 2014 and September  2014  the  appellant
   and his wife were paid in cash and the income during  that  period  could
   not, therefore, be used towards  meeting  the  financial  requirement  of
   �18,600. The income which could be used  towards  meeting  the  financial
   requirement  was  not  sufficient  to  meet  the  �18,600  threshold  and
   accordingly the appellant was not able to meet the requirements of the R-
   LTRP.1.1(c). The respondent went on to consider  the  appellant's  family
   life and private life within the immigration rules, but  considered  that
   the criteria in Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE(1)  could  not  be  met.
   With  regard  to  family  life,  the  respondent  considered   that   the
   requirements of EX.1(b) were not met as there was  no  evidence  to  show
   that there were insurmountable obstacles to family life  being  continued
   outside the UK. The respondent considered that there were no  exceptional
   circumstances justifying a grant of leave outside the immigration rules.

5. The appellant appealed against that decision. His  appeal  was  heard  by
   First-tier Tribunal Judge Smith on 22 July 2015. Judge Smith  noted  that
   it was not in dispute that the bank statements produced by the  appellant
   for the relevant six month period prior to the application showed  salary
   going into the account for only four of the  six  months,  and  that  the
   appellants were being paid in cash for the other  two  month  period.  He
   noted that it was therefore accepted that the appellant  could  not  meet
   the requirements of paragraph 2 of  Appendix  FM-SE  of  the  immigration
   rules. However, the judge found that the fact that  the  appellant's  and
   sponsor's salary had not been paid into a bank account for  a  two  month
   period was a "minor evidential problem" for  the  purposes  of  paragraph
   D(e) of Appendix FM-SE and paragraph 3.4.2 of the Immigration Directorate
   Instructions (IDIs) and that, in failing to recognise that and  to  apply
   her own policy on evidential flexibility principles, the  respondent  had
   not acted in accordance with the law. The judge found that, since all the
   other requirements of the immigration rules had been met, leave should be
   granted. He allowed the appeal under the immigration rules.

6. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought by  the  respondent
   on the grounds that the judge had no power to allow the  appeal  outright
   under evidential flexibility, but that in any event  his  application  of
   evidential flexibility was irrational.

7. Permission to appeal was granted on 10 December 2015 on  the  basis  that
   the judge had arguably incorrectly  applied  the  evidential  flexibility
   provisions.

Appeal Hearing

8. At the hearing Ms Johnstone submitted  that  the  evidential  flexibility
   provisions in paragraph 245AA and Appendix FM-SE  paragraph  D,  and  the
   IDIs did not apply in this  case,  as  it  was  not  a  matter  of  minor
   evidential problems with the appellant's application, but rather evidence
   that was entirely missing.  The  appropriate  course  would  be  for  the
   appellant to make a fresh application  with  the  relevant  evidence.  Ms
   Johnstone asked that the judge's decision  be  set  aside  and  that  the
   decision be re-made by dismissing the appeal. It was noted at this  point
   that the judge had dealt with Article 8 in his decision.

9. Mrs Zahoor  submitted  that  the  judge  was  entitled  to  rely  on  the
   evidential flexibility provisions, given that the appellant was  able  to
   meet the financial requirements of the immigration rules, having met  the
   income threshold of �18,600, and had produced evidence of more  than  six
   months' salary deposited into a bank account, but had failed  only  as  a
   result of two months' missing evidence. The  appellant  had  provided  an
   explanation about the missing deposits in  the  bank  accounts  from  his
   employer, and his wife's employer, namely that their salary had been paid
   in cash for those two months. That had been explained by the appellant at
   page 40 of his FLR(M) application form.  The  respondent  ought  to  have
   considered that a valid reason had been given and that there was  only  a
   minor evidential problem, for the purposes of paragraph D(e) of  Appendix
   FM-SE  and the IDIs and  ought  to  have  applied  her  own  policy.  The
   respondent could also have reconsidered the matter in the  light  of  the
   additional evidence submitted  for  the  appeal  showing  further  salary
   payments. Mrs Zahoor relied on the case of  Sultana  and  Others  (rules:
   waiver/further enquiry; discretion) [2014] UKUT  540  in  regard  to  the
   respondent's discretion and powers of waiver and submitted that the judge
   had the power to review the  respondent's  discretion  and  had  properly
   allowed the appeal.

Consideration and Findings

10. No issue has been taken with the judge's reference  at  [19]  to  "entry
   clearance" as constituting a material error and clearly that must be  the
   case. The judge, at [1] plainly understood that this was  an  application
   for leave to remain and not  an  entry  clearance  application,  and  the
   reference at [19] was plainly a typing error which had no material impact
   on the decision.

11.   It  is  clear,  however,  that  the  judge  erred  in   law   in   his
   interpretation  of  the  evidential  flexibility   provisions   and   the
   discretion available to the respondent. It  is  equally  clear  that  Mrs
   Zahoor, in seeking to justify the judge's  decision,  also  misunderstood
   the same provisions and proceeded on a misunderstanding of the principles
   set out in Sultana. Indeed, rather than assisting the appellant, the case
   of Sultana makes it clear that he cannot succeed.




12. At [16] of Sultana, the President  set  out  the  full  requirements  of
   paragraph [D] of Appendix FM -SE, as follows::


    "[D](a) In deciding an application in relation to which  this  Appendix
    states that specified documents must be provided,  the  .....  decision
    maker will  consider  documents  that  have  been  submitted  with  the
    application and  will  only  consider  documents  submitted  after  the
    application where subparagraph (b) or (e) applies.


         (b) If the applicant -


         (i) has submitted:


                      (aa)  a  sequence  of  documents  and  some  of   the
                           documents in the sequence have been  omitted  (eg
                           if one bank statement from a series is missing);


                      (bb) a document in the wrong format (for example,  if
                           a  letter  is  not  on  letter  head   paper   as
                           specified); or


                      (cc)       a document that  is  a  copy  and  not  an
                           original document; or


                      (dd)      a document which does not  contain  all  of
                           the specified information; or

                  (ii)               has not submitted a specified document,



                  the decision  maker  may  contact  the  applicant  or  his
                  representative, in writing or otherwise, and  request  the
                  document(s) or  the  corrected  version(s).  The  material
                  requested must be received at the address specified in the
                  request within a reasonable time scale  specified  in  the
                  request.

             (c) The decision maker will not request documents where he  or
                  she does not  anticipate  that  addressing  the  error  or
                  omission referred to in (b) will lead to a  grant  because
                  the applicant will be refused for other reasons.


             (d)   If the applicant has submitted:


                (i) a document in the wrong format; or


                (ii) a  document  that  is  a  copy  and  not  an  original
            document,


                the application may be granted exceptionally, provided  the
                decision maker is satisfied that the  document  is  genuine
                and that the applicant meets the requirements to which  the
                document relates. The decision maker reserves the right  to
                request the certified  original  document  in  the  correct
                format in  all  cases  where  (b)  applies  and  to  refuse
                applications if this material is not provided as set out in
                (b).

             (e) Where the decision maker is  satisfied  that  there  is  a
             valid reason why a specified document cannot  be  supplied  eg
             because it is not issued in a particular country or  has  been
             permanently lost, he or she may  exercise  discretion  not  to
             apply  the  requirement  for  the  document  or   to   request
             alternative  or  additional  information  or  document(s)   be
             submitted by the applicant."

13. Judge Smith, in quoting paragraph D(e) of Appendix FM-SE at [17] of  his
   decision, was somewhat selective in his consideration of  the  evidential
   flexibility provisions. He did not make  it  entirely  clear  upon  which
   other part of paragraph D he relied.  When  referring  to  the  IDIs,  he
   appears to have proceeded  on  the  basis  that  part  of  the  specified
   evidence was  missing,  but  did  not  explain  how  that  fitted  within
   paragraph D of  Appendix  FM-SE,  which  referred  to  various  different
   circumstances.

14. In any event it is  clear  from  the  requirements  of  paragraph  2  of
   Appendix FM-SE, as set out at [14] of the  judge's  decision,  that  bank
   statements  corresponding  to  the   entire   period   of   six   months,
   corresponding to the payslips for the same  period,  showing  the  salary
   being paid into the  appellant's  and/or  his  sponsor's  account  was  a
   mandatory requirement of the rules.  It  was,  therefore,  a  case  of  a
   mandatory document not having been submitted, whereas the  judge  appears
   to have considers the situation as being one where part of  the  evidence
   was  missing.  Furthermore,  whilst  the  situations  in  Appendix  FM-SE
   paragraph D(e) for specified documents not having been supplied are given
   as examples and do not form an exhaustive list,  it  is  clear  that  the
   appellant's circumstances do not fall within  this  provision  and  Judge
   Smith did not explain how they did.

15. As the President found in Sultana at [18] in regard to that  appellant's
   circumstances, so too in this case the evidential flexibility  provisions
   are "far removed from the present case", where  the  infirmities  in  the
   appellant's application arise out of "an  outright  failure  to  provide"
   mandatory documents. This was not a matter of a document which  was  lost
   or missing, but was a document that simply did not  exist.  Thus,  as  in
   Sultana, there is no basis for concluding that the  respondent's  failure
   to exercise the discretion available to her was not  in  accordance  with
   the law.


16. Accordingly Judge Smith  erred  in  law  in  his  consideration  of  the
   respondent's discretion under the evidential  flexibility  provisions  in
   the rules and policy and for all of these  reasons  his  decision  cannot
   stand. I therefore set aside his decision.

17. For the same reasons the appellant cannot  succeed  in  his  appeal.  He
   cannot meet the evidential requirements in Appendix FM-SE. The evidential
   flexibility provisions in paragraph D of  Appendix  FM-SE  and  paragraph
   245AA of the  immigration  rules  do  not  apply  to  his  circumstances.
   Accordingly the decision in the appellant's appeal has to be  re-made  by
   dismissing the appeal.


18. With regard to Article 8, Judge Smith,  whilst  stating  at  [20]  that,
   having allowed the  appeal  under  the  immigration  rules,  it  was  not
   necessary for him to go  on  to  consider  Article  8,  nevertheless  did
   consider Article 8. He found that, in the  absence  of  his  findings  on
   evidential flexibility, the respondent's decision was  otherwise  not  in
   breach of Article 8. The appellant  has  not  sought  to  challenge  that
   finding in the Rule 24 response or by way of a cross-appeal  and  neither
   was there any challenge raised before me. On the evidence before me it is
   clear, in any event, that the appellant cannot succeed on  an  Article  8
   claim. There is no suggestion, nor evidence to suggest that  there  would
   be insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside the UK  for
   the  purposes  of  EX.1.(b)  and  neither  are   there   any   compelling
   circumstances justifying a grant of leave outside the immigration  rules.
   That was the conclusion properly reached by  the  judge  and  the  appeal
   therefore also fails on that basis.

DECISION

19. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved an  error
   on a point of law. The Secretary of State's appeal is accordingly allowed
   and the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside as stated above.
   I re-make the decision by dismissing Mr Saleem's appeal on  all  grounds,
   under the immigration rules and on human rights grounds.
