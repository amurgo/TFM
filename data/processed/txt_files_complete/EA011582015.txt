                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
        Gurung-Thapa promulgated on 14 November 2016  in  which  the  Judge
        dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  refusal  of  the
        respondent  to  issue  a  Residence  Card  in  recognition  of  the
        appellant's right to remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of a
        retained right of residence.
     2. The Judge noted that it was submitted by Mr Awal during the hearing
        that the appellant seeks to rely on being a family member  who  has
        retained a right of residence under Regulation 10(5)  of  the  2006
        Regulations. Mr Awal stated this is a  stand-alone  regulation  and
        that the appellant can rely on  the  EEA  national  exercising  his
        treaty rights on the termination of the marriage or she can rely on
        her own right. The appellant was not working at the termination  of
        the marriage but the EEA national was and as evidence  of  this  he
        relied upon the payment  received  by  HMRC  (pages  37-38  of  the
        appellant's bundle).
     3. The Judge records that Mr  Awal  submitted  the  appellant  is  not
        seeking to rely on Regulation 10(6) because she would have to  show
        that she was in continuous employment and there was no  alternative
        reliance on any of the 2006 Regulations.
     4. Having considered the evidence Judge notes that her reading of  the
        Regulations is that the appellant has to satisfy  the  requirements
        set out in Regulation 10(5) and (6) as Regulation 10(5)(c)  clearly
        states that the person has to satisfy the conditions  in  paragraph
        6.
     5. The  appellant  maintained  that  she  satisfies  the  requirements
        because she has produced an HMRC payment confirmation  and  a  note
        from MDM Accountancy dated 18  March  2015  addressed  to  the  EEA
        national attaching payment confirmation  of  �100  from  HMRC.  The
        Judge, however,  at  [22]  finds  "I  do  not  find  that  this  is
        satisfactory evidence  to  establish  that  the  EEA  national  was
        exercising his treaty rights on the termination  of  the  marriage.
        Further, the appellant also cannot satisfy the requirement  in  her
        own right as she was  not  in  employment  on  termination  of  the
        marriage given the fact that she was laid off from  her  employment
        in January 2015".
     6. In the alternative, the Judge considers at [23 - 25]  the  position
        as if EEA national was exercising treaty rights on  termination  of
        the marriage thereby  satisfying  the  requirements  of  Regulation
        10(5)(b) by way  of  considering  whether  the  appellant  met  the
        requirement of regulation 10(5)(d)(i).  The  Judge  found  she  was
        satisfied that prior to the initiation of the  divorce  proceedings
        the marriage had lasted for at  least  three  years  and  that  the
        parties to the marriage had resided in the UK for at least one year
        during its duration.
     7. Judge then considers regulation 10(6)(a) and expresses a view  that
        the requirements of this regulation have to be met at the  date  of
        divorce as this is when the matrimonial  relationship  between  the
        EEA national and non-EEA national ceases and the  non-EEA  national
        is given the opportunity to retain a right of residence in  his  or
        her own right. The Judge refers to the decision  of  the  Court  of
        Appeal in Amos & Anor v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 552 in  which  it  was
        held that Regulation 10(6)(a) requires the non-EEA national  to  be
        economically active. The Judge notes the appellant's  own  evidence
        was that she was not economically active at the date of divorce  so
        her last period of work was in January 2015  leading  to  it  being
        concluded the appellant was not able to  meet  the  requirement  of
        Regulation 10(6)(a).
     8. The Judge thereafter considered regulation 15(1)(f) and  found  the
        appellant could  not  satisfy  this  requirement  as  she  had  not
        established she was a  worker,  self-employed,  or  self-sufficient
        person at the date of divorce and thereafter until she returned  to
        work in December 2015.
     9. The appellant sought permission to  appeal  which  was  granted  by
        another judge of the First-tier tribunal. The operative part of the
        grant being in the following terms:


        3.   In her decision the judge  at  paragraph  25  noted  that  the
             Appellant was not economically  active  at  the  date  of  the
             divorce, her last period of work was January  2015,  therefore
             she failed to establish she was economically  active  and  did
             not [meet] the requirements of  Regulation  10  (6)  (a).  The
             judge  may  have  not  taken  a  structured  approach  to  the
             necessary fact-finding exercise  and  misdirected  herself  in
             relation to the case of Amos and Anor [2011] EWCA Civ 552.  In
             the form of material error that the Appellant, as  opposed  to
             the EEA partner, should have  been  working  at  the  time  of
             divorce per paragraph 10.  It  appears  that  the  EEA  former
             partner also may have been exercising  treaty  rights  as  the
             Appellant submitted evidence from a four-part  self-assessment
             payment HMRC and a letter from MDM Accountancy dated  back  on
             18 March 2015 confirming  that.   Amos  denotes  there  is  no
             requirement for the Appellant to produce evidence  of  working
             and the former partner duly exercising treaty  rights  and  in
             all these respects the judge may have fallen into error by not
             addressing such salient points in accordance with the law  and
             the Regulations.



Error of law


    10. It is not disputed that the appellant, a citizen  of  Jamaica,  was
        married to an EEA national from whom she was divorced on  30  March
        2015. The application for a Residence  Card,  on  the  basis  of  a
        retained right of residence upon  divorce  or  right  of  permanent
        residence, was rejected by the Secretary of State who  specifically
        noted in the refusal:


              . You have not provided  evidence  of  your  sponsors  treaty
                rights around the date of your divorce on 30 March 2015 the
                most recent evidence you have provided  is  dated  5  April
                2014, nearly a year prior to the date of your divorce.  You
                have failed to provide the  necessary  information,  it  is
                deemed that you have not met the criteria  as  set  out  in
                regulation 10(5)(b) of the regulations.
              . To satisfy the criteria of regulation 10(6) (in relation to
                15(1)(f)) you would need to provide evidence of your  being
                a worker, self-employed person or a self-sufficient  person
                following the date  of  your  divorce.  Whilst  it  can  be
                accepted that you have been  employed  from  31  July  2010
                until 30 January 2015, you have  provided  no  evidence  of
                your being  a  worker,  self-employed  person  or  a  self-
                sufficient person after the date  of  your  divorce  on  30
                March 2015. As such you have failed to meet the criteria as
                required by regulation 10(6) in relation to 15(1)(f).
              . Due to your providing no evidence of your former spouse  is
                treaty rights around  the  date  of  your  divorce  and  no
                evidence of your being a worker, self-employed person or  a
                self-sufficient person after the date of your  divorce,  it
                is deemed that you have failed to evidence  your  residence
                in the United Kingdom in accordance  with  the  Regulations
                for a continuous period of five  years.  Therefore  it  has
                been decided to refuse the confirmation that you seek  with
                reference to regulation 15(1)(f) in relation to  10(5)  and
                10(6)  of  the   Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
                Regulations 2006.


    11. The appellant asserts that there was evidence before the Judge.  It
        is not disputed that material was provided but in  [22]  the  Judge
        did not find that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the
        EEA  national  was  exercising  treaty  rights  at  the   date   of
        termination of the marriage as noted above.
    12. The appellant asserts that she provided all the evidence  that  was
        available which by nature was  historical  as  she  could  not  get
        updated material, although it was at accepted and admitted that  no
        application been made to the First-tier Tribunal to see if the  EEA
        national could be found or to seek his attendance or the production
        of relevant documents for the purposes of the hearing.
    13. In the case of Amos [2011] EWCA Civ 552 Court of Appeal held that a
        divorced spouse had to establish that he or she had  the  right  of
        residence before the question whether notwithstanding  the  divorce
        the right had been retained could be determined. It was found there
        is no obligation upon the Secretary of  State  to  assist  a  third
        country  national  in  obtaining  missing  information  about   the
        divorced EEA national  in  light  of  the  essentially  adversarial
        nature of  immigration  appeals,  confirming  that  the  burden  of
        proving entitlement rests upon the person so asserting.  The  court
        also found that the requirements of the Citizens Directive was that
        at all times while residing in  the  UK  until  their  divorce  the
        spouse had to be a worker or self-employed,  the  marriage  had  to
        have lasted for at least three years, including one year in the  UK
        and they had to show  that  they  were  workers,  self-employed  or
        otherwise satisfy the penultimate paragraph of Article 13(2) of the
        Citizen's Directive. The two concerns in relation  to  this  appeal
        outlined by the Judge is that the  evidence  did  not  satisfy  the
        First-tier Tribunal that the EEA national was  a  worker  or  self-
        employed person up until the date of divorce or that the  appellant
        had shown that she was a worker or self-employed  or  otherwise  at
        that time.
    14. The appellant asserts that evidence was provided of  the  partner's
        self-employment status as evidenced by  payments  from  HMRC  in  a
        letter from an accountant confirming the same.
    15. Within the bundle is notification given to HMRC of the EEA national
        becoming  self-employed  and  registering  for  National  Insurance
        contributions  indicating  the  EEA  national  set   up   a   house
        maintenance business on 11 February 2011 as a  sole  trader.  Self-
        assessment statements dated 28 June 2012,  11  September  2013,  24
        June  2013  were  provided  with  the  application  together   with
        documents relating to the payment of self-employed class 2 National
        Insurance contributions. Those documents do not cover the  relevant
        period.
    16. The Judge noted the evidence from the appellant  that  her  husband
        had left the matrimonial home in the middle of 2014, 14 June  2014,
        and asked how she  had  managed  to  get  hold  of  self-assessment
        payment receipt from HMRC if she claims to  have  no  contact  with
        him. The response was that the appellant knew  the  accountant  the
        EEA national used and that when he left he was  still  working  and
        that the last thing she had was that  receipt.  The  appellant  had
        herself been laid off as a  care  assistant  in  January  2015  and
        remained unemployed until December 2015.  The  Judge  clearly  took
        careful note of the evidence provided and noted that the note  from
        MDM Accountancy dated 18 March 2015 addressed to the  EEA  national
        attached payment confirmation  of  �100  from  HMRC.  The  evidence
        indicates a number of penalties and fines being  imposed  upon  the
        EEA national for late service/filing of tax returns and the  return
        of the payment from HMRC without clearly defining the  purpose  for
        which it is made is arguably insufficient to establish that the EEA
        national was exercising treaty  rights.  This  does  not  make  out
        arguable legal error in the primary finding of the Judge  that  the
        appellant had not discharged the necessary  burden  of  proof  upon
        her.
    17. The assertion that requiring the appellant to provide  evidence  of
        the former partners exercise of treaty rights was unlawful  is  not
        arguably made  out.  The  Court  of  Appeal  clearly  set  out  the
        necessary legal test in Amos. The Upper  Tribunal  decision  relied
        upon by the appellant, HS [2011] UKUT 165, found that 1. Where  the
        Secretary of State revokes a residence card before  the  expiry  of
        its validity it falls on her to justify such revocation.
        2. Regulation 10 of Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 requires the
        applicant to demonstrate that: a genuine marriage has lasted  three
        years and the couple have spent one year  together  in  the  United
        Kingdom and that the EEA  national  spouse  was  exercising  treaty
        rights at the time he ceased to be a family member.
    18. It is the second point upon which the  Judge  found  the  appellant
        failed to produce sufficient evidence.
    19. The alleged misdirection of the decision of the Court of Appeal  in
        Amos is not arguably made out. Judgment in  that  case  was  handed
        down on 12 May 2011. The Judge arguably assess the former  partners
        evidence relating to the exercise of treaty rights  which  was  not
        found to discharge the required burden. Whilst  that  evidence  may
        have shown the EEA national was not working at the date of divorce,
        which it is arguable  was  the  only  conclusion  that  could  been
        arrived at, there was insufficient evidence to  support  a  finding
        that even though there was no evidence of actual  working  at  that
        time or exercise of treaty rights as a  self-employed  person,  the
        EEA national retained his status as a worker as per the decision in
        HS.
    20. No arguable legal error material to the  decision  to  dismiss  the
        appeal is made out on the evidence provided to  the  Judge  and  to
        this Tribunal. The determination shall stand.


Decision

    21. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
