Representation:

For the appellant:     Ms J Campbell, instructed by 1st Call UK Immigration
Services
For the respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Ruramai Manguwo, date of birth 14.5.97, is a citizen  of
    Zimbabwe.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Hollingworth, who dismissed his appeal against  the  decision  of
    the respondent, dated 23.4.13, to refuse entry clearance to the  United
    Kingdom as the child of  person  granted  refugee  status  pursuant  to
    paragraph 352AA of the Immigration  Rules.  The  application  was  also
    refused under  paragraph  320(7A).   The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    16.6.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Mailer  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    4.8.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 13.10.14

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Hollingworth should be set aside.

 6. The refusal decision referenced a previous application, made  in  2009,
    in which the appellant made false representations as  to  her  identity
    and relationship with a sponsor in the UK. The application was  refused
    and a subsequent appeal dismissed.

 7. In making the application the subject  of  this  appeal  the  appellant
    failed to disclose that previous application. The refusal decision went
    on to point out that having been  refused  under  320(7A),  any  future
    application may be refused under paragraph 320(7B). The application was
    not, however, being refused under 320(7B) and I note  that  it  applies
    only to a person age 18 or over, when this appellant is under that age.



 8. Paragraph 320(7A) provides for mandatory refusal on  grounds  of  false
    representation or the failure to disclose material facts. Case law  has
    established that this requires dishonesty but it is also clear that  it
    need not be on the part  of  the  appellant  herself.  The  failure  to
    disclose the previous false  application  could  well  have  founded  a
    refusal under 320(7A), but it is clear that was not the basis on  which
    the application was refused. The refusal decision expressly states that
    the application was refused  under  paragraph  320(7A)  because  "false
    representations were made in your previous visa application."

 9.  In  dismissing  the  appeal,  Judge  Hollingworth  appears   to   have
    misunderstood the basis of the refusal  decision  and  in  the  process
    confused 320(7A) with 320(7B). At �35  he  stated  that  the  "findings
    under paragraphs 320(7A) and (7B) are upheld." That  was  an  error  of
    law. There was no 320(7B) decision and because of the  appellant's  age
    one could not be made in this case. As far as 320(7A) is concerned, the
    judge may have been misled by counsel representing the  appellant,  who
    conceded that the appellant could not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules and that the refusal under 320(7A)  was  "entirely  sustainable,"
    (�17). However, as  the  decision  was  made  on  the  basis  of  false
    representations in the 2009 decision, it was not in accordance with the
    law. As drafted, 320(7A) appears to  relate  only  to  the  application
    being considered and not past history, which is catered for by 320(7B).



10. Mr Harrison accepted that the refusal decision was in error  and  could
    not stand and thus in the circumstances did not  resist  Ms  Campbell's
    error of law submissions.

11. In the circumstances, I find that there was an  error  of  law  in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that  it  should
    be set aside and remade, by allowing the appeal to the  limited  extent
    that it remains for the Secretary of State to make a decision  that  is
    in accordance with the law.



Conclusion & Decision:

12. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing  it  to
                    the  limited  extent  only  that  it  remains  for   the
                    Secretary of State to make a decision in accordance with
                    the law.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a full fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been allowed.
