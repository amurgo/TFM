                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Herbert OBE, promulgated on  10th  September  2014,  following  a
    hearing at Taylor House on 13th August 2014.  In the determination, the
    judge allowed the appeal of Miss Princess Macalidong.   The  Respondent
    Secretary  of  State,  subsequently  applied  for,  and   was   granted
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of the Philippines.  She was  born  on  20th
    July 1986.  She made an application on 9th July 2012 to vary her  leave
    to remain in the UK.  This was refused on 7th August 2013.  The refusal
    was based on the new Immigration Rules which came into  effect  on  9th
    July 2012.  The new Immigration Rules specify  the  requirements  under
    paragraph 276ADE where it is clear that the Appellant did not meet  the
    criteria as she was a person who had entered the UK in 2008 and had not
    lived continuously in the UK for at least twenty years as  required  by
    that provision.  She was age 25 years.  And so in  this  respect  also,
    she did not meet the requirements of the new Immigration Rules.  On the
    other hand, she had lived in the Philippines for 22 years  and  in  the
    absence of any evidence to the contrary it was not  accepted  that  she
    would have lost ties there, so as to be unable to relocate there, or to
    return there.

The Appellant

 3. The Appellant's case is that she met her partner, Mr Glen Blake,  on  a
    train  in  January  2013.   Their  relationship  as  a  boyfriend   and
    girlfriend started a few weeks afterwards.  The Appellant then  met  Mr
    Blake's parents as well as his brother  and  sister.   They  have  been
    living together now since about March 2014.  They plan to marry as soon
    as practicable.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge held that the  effect  of  the  parties  splitting  by  being
    required for one of  them  to  return  to  the  Philippines  "would  be
    devastating" and that there were "serious  and  significant  obstacles"
    (paragraph 32).  The judge accepted that the marriage was a genuine one
    (paragraph  37).   He  also  accepted  that  "given  the  strength  and
    durability of this relationship that the parties clearly do  intend  to
    get married to each other next year in the Philippines  and  that  they
    have been living together for a period of six  months  ..."  (paragraph
    39).  He also held that, "there is a large degree  of  likelihood  that
    even if the Appellant were removed this relationship would continue and
    that she would subsequently without  much  delay  and  expense  make  a
    successful application to re-enter ..." (paragraph 41).  The  case  law
    under Article 8 was applied with reference to Gulshan  and  the  appeal
    allowed (see paragraphs 42 to 43).

Grounds of Application

 5. The grounds of application  stated  that  the  judge  failed  to  apply
    Section 117A  to  Section  117D  of  the  2002  Act  in  assessing  the
    proportionality of the Secretary of State's decision.  He  also  failed
    to have regard to the Court of Appeal judgment in MM [2014] EWCA Civ.

 6. On 27th November 2014, permission to appeal was granted.

 7. On 12th January 2014 the matter came before Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge
    JM Lewis at Field  House  for  determination.   The  Tribunal  on  that
    occasion determined that paragraph 117B had not been properly  applied.
    She may have been able to speak English, given that she  gave  evidence
    in that language before the Tribunal.  However, there  were  issues  in
    relation to financial independence (see paragraph 117B(3)).

 8. The judge observed that,

         "This issue was not  addressed  in  the  determination.   There  is
         documentary  evidence  of  the  Sponsor's   finances   within   the
         Appellant's bundle, which the  judge referred to at  paragraph  16.
         At the error of law hearing, Mr Singer submitted that this evidence
         would  have  established  compliance  with  the  threshold  in  the
         Immigration Rules for financial sufficiency ..." (paragraph 10).

 9. However, the Tribunal held that,




         "There was no evidence to support the finding at paragraph 32  that
         the effect of separation upon the relationship of the parties would
         be devastating.  It  does  not  sit  easily  with  the  finding  at
         paragraph 26 that the judge was satisfied that this was a long-term
         serious committed relationship ..." (paragraph 11).

10. There was  also  no  medical  evidence  that  the  Sponsor  would  have
    difficulty in the heat in the Philippines  to  be  able  to  cope  (see
    paragraph  12).   Neither  was  there  any  evidence,  as  claimed  (at
    paragraphs 33 and 41)  that  any  application  made  on  the  basis  of
    engagement or marriage would involve much delay and expense on the part
    of the Appellant and the Sponsor (see paragraph 13).

11. However, the judge did not determine the  substantive  issues  on  this
    occasion.  Instead, it was held that, "on reflection,  I  have  decided
    that there is a sufficient unreliability about some of the findings  of
    fact that the appeal needs to be reheard entirely" (paragraph 16).

12. It is in  these  circumstances  that  this  matter  comes  before  this
    Tribunal.

Submissions

13. At the hearing before me on 3rd August 2015, Mr  Singer,  appearing  on
    behalf of  the  Appellant,  submitted  that  he  would  call  both  the
    Appellant and the Sponsor  to  give  evidence.   He  first  called  the
    Appellant herself.  She adopted her witness statement (at  pages  1  to
    4), and the witness statement was signed before me today on 3rd  August
    2015.  She confirmed she was  in  a  long-term  relationship  with  the
    Sponsor having been living with him since March 2014.   She  also  said
    that her partner, Glen Blake was working, but she was  not  working  as
    she was not allowed to.  She was asked why she could not return to  the
    Philippines to get married, as she had maintained before Judge  Herbert
    OBE.  She stated that she did not want to risk  doing  so  without  her
    immigration status becoming more secure.  She went on to say  that  her
    partner could not secure a job in the Philippines as he could not speak
    the local language.  She did confirm that she had herself, two brothers
    and two sisters there.  However, her partner had no family there.   She
    had been in the UK on a student visa.  If she had leave  to  remain  in
    this country she would have been working by now.  She could  not  marry
    in the UK as she did not have her passport with her.

14. In cross-examination, she was asked whether her partner knew about  her
    student status.  She said that he subsequently found out after quite  a
    while.  She was asked to provide the evidence that her partner had been
    unable to find a job.  She said that  he  had  been  searching  on  the
    internet but she did not bring any evidence with  her  today  to  prove
    that he had been doing so.  She was asked if she knew how long it  took
    for a visa application to get through the system  in  the  Philippines.
    She said she did not know.  It was put to her that the only reason  why
    she was, in that case, refusing to return was simply because she wanted
    to stay  in  this  country.   She  had  made  no  enquiries.   She  had
    undertaken no research.  She and her partner simply did not know.   She
    said this was not the case.

15. There was no re-examination.  Mr Singer then  called  the  Sponsor,  Mr
    Glen Blake, to give evidence.  He adopted  his  witness  statement  (at
    pages 5 to 7) which was dated in front of me and signed on  3rd  August
    2015.  He was asked to confirm the contents of his P60 for April  2015,
    which showed that his earnings were �20,847 (see page 6 of  29  of  the
    latest bundle).  He said this was  indeed  the  case.   The  judge  had
    accepted this evidence but had not made any reference to  the  evidence
    as such.  Mr Singer said that he had no further questions to put.

16. In cross-examination the witness was asked what research  he  had  done
    for a job in the Philippines.   Mr  Blake  replied  that  he  had  been
    working in the UK in a casino for the last eight years, and so  it  was
    natural for him to be looking for a job in the same capacity.   He  had
    gone to the website, Gamingfloor.com, and then searched under that  for
    Casino Forum, for jobs in cities like Manila, but nothing had come  up.
    He was asked if he had looked at the length of time it  takes  for  his
    partner to get a visa from Manila.  He said he had not done so.  He was
    asked at what point he found out that his wife's immigration status was
    precarious.  He said it was around March 2014.  He said he was not in a
    rush to find out.  As far  as  he  was  concerned,  he  was  a  British
    citizen, who had fallen in love, and it was the most natural thing  for
    him to expect that, having fallen in love, he would be allowed to  live
    with his loved one in the country in which he was born and in which  he
    lived.  He said that by the time he did find out his relationship  with
    the Appellant had developed very considerably.  After all, they had met
    in January 2013, and he had only found out that  the  "gravity  of  her
    immigration status" was going to be a problem around  March  2014.   He
    was asked what was stopping him from being separated with  his  partner
    for three or four months.  He said that three or four months was a long
    time and this "would take her away from me".

17. In his closing speech, Mr Bramble relied upon the refusal letter of 7th
    August 2013.  He handed up the Court of Appeal decision in Singh [2015]
    EWCA  Civ  74.   This  establishes  that  it  is  unnecessary,   in   a
    freestanding Article 8 consideration, to move to a second stage, if  at
    the first  stage,  all  the  necessary  issues  are  addressed  by  the
    Immigration Rules.  If any family life or private life issues raised by
    the claim have already been redressed at the first stage,  then  it  is
    unnecessary to go to the second stage  (see  paragraphs  65  to  67  of
    Singh).  That, submitted Mr Bramble, was the position precisely in this
    case.  Second, after 6th September 2012, the new Rules in HC 565 had to
    be satisfied.  This meant that  the  requirements  therein  had  to  be
    complied with.  Third, in relation to  the  new  Rules,  the  Court  of
    Appeal had now made it clear in Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ  440  that,  in
    complying with Section EX.1(b) the "insurmountable obstacles" criterion
    is used in the Rules to define one of the preconditions which  need  to
    be satisfied before an applicant can claim to be entitled to be granted
    leave to remain under the Rules.  It is not simply a factor to be taken
    into account.  (See paragraph 24).  The Appellant had not been able  to
    establish that there were "insurmountable obstacles to her returning to
    the Philippines just in order to make a proper  application  from  that
    country".

18. Finally, if I was not with Mr Bramble on this point,  and  freestanding
    Article 8 jurisprudence had to be invoked,  then  the  Appellant  would
    still fail if regard was had to Lord Bingham's tabulation at  paragraph
    17 of Razgar, because the appeal would be lost on the  basis  that  the
    decision of the Secretary of State was not  disproportionate.   Subject
    to these matters, it was accepted that the Appellant  did  satisfy  the
    financial requirements test because her sponsoring partner was  earning
    �20,847.  Equally, it was accepted that there was a  tenancy  agreement
    from the landlord confirming the parties living together so that  there
    was no question mark raised in relation to the  "durable  relationship"
    of the parties.  Nevertheless, the appeal would fail on the grounds set
    out above.

19. In his closing speech, Mr  Singer  submitted  that  Judge  Herbert  OBE
    allowed the appeal.  The basis of the refusal letter was wrong.  It was
    also wrong to say that he did not give sufficient consideration to  the
    relationship and to the Appellant's ability to speak  English,  and  to
    the fact that she was not  a  charge  on  public  funds.   Where  Judge
    Herbert did go wrong, however, it was  in  failing  to  make  expressed
    reference to Section 117B of the 2014 Act.  Mr Singer submitted that he
    had conceded as much the last time he appeared in  the  Upper  Tribunal
    before Judge Lewis.

20. Today, however, there was evidence of earnings over �18,600  given  the
    P60 for 2015.  There was also evidence of the tenancy agreement.   Both
    of these were objective pieces of evidence which had been  accepted  by
    Mr Bramble as well today.  That left the question of  Article  8,  upon
    which this appeal was based.  Mr Singer submitted that all the case law
    from Ganesabalan to SS (Congo), make it clear that there was  indeed  a
    two stage test to be applied before  one  could  decide  to  leave  the
    domain of the Immigration Rules and enter the  domain  of  freestanding
    Article 8 jurisprudence.

21. This was because the Rules do not sufficiently cover every eventuality.
     With respect to a case such as the present,  it  was  plain  that  the
    Rules did not cover such  an  eventuality.   The  Appellant  could  not
    succeed under the Rules because the Rules required her to be in  a  two
    year subsisting relationship with a partner.  Of necessity,  therefore,
    she had to look to the situation outside the Rules.

22. Second, the Rules also had to be abandoned  given  that  they  did  not
    cover the Article 8 rights of Mr Glen Blake and it was clear  from  the
    House of Lord's judgments in Beoku-Betts that, because family  life  is
    composite, one could not divorce the rights of the Appellant from those
    of the Sponsor in this case.

23. But thirdly, once one was in  the  domain  of  freestanding  Article  8
    jurisprudence, there was no requirement of insurmountable obstacles  to
    be met, which was a creature specifically of statute, and which was one
    of the conditions needed to comply with the requirements under  Section
    EX.1(b).  This was made clear by Sedley JL in VW (Uganda)  and  it  was
    made clear most importantly by the House of Lords in EB (Kosovo).   The
    test   in   freestanding   Article   8   jurisprudence   is   that   of
    "reasonableness".

24. It was misconceived to place reliance upon  Agyarko  because  that  was
    specifically on EX.1(b) because the issue there was compliance with the
    Immigration Rules.  The facts of Agyarko were very different.  In  that
    case, Mrs Agyarko, a national of Ghana, had entered the UK with limited
    leave in 2003, and  had  then  become  an  illegal  overstayer,  before
    forming a  relationship  and  cohabiting  with  a  naturalised  British
    citizen.  They married by proxy in accordance with Ghanaian  law.   Her
    relationship had always  been  precarious  (see  paragraph  11  of  the
    judgment).  For this reason, it was  unsurprising  that  the  Court  of
    Appeal decided that,

         ".....she had no  right  to  be  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  was
         therefore precarious in the relevant sense, it is only if her  case
         is exceptional for some reason that she would be able to  establish
         a violation of Article 8." (See paragraph 28).

25. The present case, submitted Mr Singer,  was  nothing  like  this.   The
    Appellant was here lawfully.  She was still  here  lawfully.   This  is
    because, having formed a relationship and having made  her  application
    under  the  partner's  route,  she  had  Section  3C  leave  under  the
    Immigration Act 1971.

26. In these circumstances, given that the Appellant could comply with  all
    the requirements, including the requirements under Section 117B of  the
    2014 Act, her position fell  to  be  determined  under  the  "Chikwamba
    principle".  In that case, the House of Lords held that there:

         "Would be a violation of Article 8 if the applicant  for  leave  to
         remain in that case were removed from the United Kingdom and forced
         to make an out of country application for leave to enter  .....  in
         circumstances where the interference with her family life with  the
         husband associate with the removal could not be said to  serve  any
         good purpose" (see paragraph 31).

27. The Court of Appeal in Agyarko went on to say that,




         "It is possible to envisage a   Chikwamba   type  case  arising  in
         which Article 8 might require  that  leave  to  remain  be  granted
         outside the Rules, even though it could not be said that there were
         insurmountable obstacles to  the  applicant  and  their  spouse  or
         partner continuing their family life  overseas.   ...."  (paragraph
         31).

    Mr Singer submitted that the instant case was precisely  such  a  case.
    He asked me to allow the appeal.





Findings

28. I have given careful consideration to all the documents before  me  and
    to the oral evidence and submissions, which are set out in  the  Record
    of Proceedings.  I find that the Appellant does discharge the burden of
    proof.  My reasons are as follows.

29. First, this is a genuine relationship.  It is a  durable  relationship.
    This has  been  accepted  by  the  Respondent.   The  Appellant  speaks
    English.  She has not been in the UK unlawfully.   She  is  financially
    self-sufficient.  She is not a charge on public funds.  The Sponsor can
    show earnings of �18,600.   There  is  a  tenancy  agreement  from  the
    landlord.  There is no poor immigration history.  This means that where
    as under Section 117B(1)  the  maintenance  of  "effective  immigration
    control is in the public interest", where the Appellant speaks  English
    and is financially independent there is no public interest in requiring
    removal.  This is also not a case where it can  be  said  that  "little
    weight should be given" to  a  private  life  or  relationship  with  a
    qualifying partner which is "established by a person at a time when the
    person is in the  UK  unlawfully".   Fundamentally,  the  Section  117B
    conditions are in the Appellant's favour.

30. Second, this is important if  one  is  to  consider  the  appeal  under
    freestanding Article 8 jurisprudence, as Mr Singer  has  maintained  it
    should be considered from  the  outset.   It  is  unnecessary  to  show
    "exceptional circumstances" given that the Appellant has been in the UK
    lawfully throughout before a freestanding Article 8  jurisprudence  can
    be enquired into.  Yet, enquired into it must be because the Rules  are
    not comprehensive enough to cover a situation such as the  Appellant's.
    The Rules require the parties to be  living  together  for  two  years.
    They also do not consider the position of the Sponsor.  With respect to
    the  consideration  of  this  claim  under   freestanding   Article   8
    jurisprudence,  however,  it  is  plain   that   the   requirement   of
    "insurmountable obstacles" is not a directly relevant one, and what  is
    required is that a viable case for showing that it is not reasonable to
    expect the Appellant to return.

31. However,  it  cannot  be  said  to  be  reasonable  if  the  "Chikwamba
    principle" applies.   I  hold  that  it  does.   This  is  because  the
    Appellant has satisfied all of  the  substantive  requirements  of  the
    Rules that apply  to  her.   She  is  financially  independent,  speaks
    English, and is not a charge on public funds, and the relationship is a
    genuine and subsisting one.  The only formal  requirements  she  cannot
    satisfy  is  that  of  being  in  possession  of  an  entry   clearance
    certificate for the purposes of entering the UK to  join  her  partner.
    It is this result which is "Kafkaesque" in the Chikwamba sense.   There
    is, as Agyarko makes clear, the unnecessary imposition of a requirement
    which "could not be said to serve any good purpose" (see paragraph 31).



32. Furthermore, I am emboldened in this conclusion by my clear finding, on
    the evidence before me, that the Sponsor  will  find  it  difficult  to
    obtain a job in the  Philippines.   Mr  Bramble  had  accepted  in  his
    closing speech that both witnesses came across as credible  and  honest
    and straightforward.  They gave their evidence in  the  best  way  they
    could.  The Appellant herself said that she would not  think  of  being
    anything other than truthful before a Court of Law.

33. The evidence, which I accept, is that the Sponsor has attempted on  the
    internet to find a job  commensurate  with  his  current  earnings  and
    position in a casino  at  a  management  level  but  nothing  has  been
    available.  It is also the case that, were he to look for a lesser job,
    he does not speak the Filipino language.  He also  has  no  friends  or
    relatives there.

34. In the circumstances, it cannot be said to be reasonable to expect  the
    Sponsor to accompany the Appellant to the Philippines either.   I  have
    already determined that there is no good sense or purpose in  requiring
    the Appellant to return there given that she does comply with  all  the
    Rules, substantively speaking, and given that the appeal can be allowed
    under freestanding Article 8 jurisprudence.  This appeal,  accordingly,
    is allowed.



Notice of Decision

35. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and it has been set aside by DUTJ Lewis.  I remake the  decision
    as follows.  This appeal is allowed.

36. No anonymity order is made.
