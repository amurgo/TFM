                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal from a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Amin dated 15 October 2014.  The appellant is from Pakistan  and  is  a
    migrant worker in Saudi Arabia.  He married  the  sponsor,  Mrs  Maryam
    Ahmed,  in  2010.   At  one  point  there  was  an  issue   about   the
    certification of  the  marriage  which  took  place  in  the  Pakistani
    Consulate in Saudi Arabia  but  that  has  now  been  resolved  in  the
    appellant's favour.  The sponsor, Mrs Ahmed, has three  children.   Two
    are in their 20's and one is in his late teens.  She and  the  children
    are citizens of this country.

2.   On 10  October  2013  the  appellant  made  an  application  for  entry
    clearance  which  was  refused.    The   outstanding   issue   in   the
    determination of the judge  concerns  whether  the  appellant  met  the
    financial requirements.  The Entry  Clearance  Officer  in  a  decision
    dated 7 November 2013 decided that the appellant and the  sponsor,  Mrs
    Ahmed, needed �62,500 in savings since savings were the basis on  which
    the application was being made.  Following an examination of  the  bank
    statements the Entry Clearance Officer decided  that  that  requirement
    was not met.  There was then a review  dated  17  March  2014  but  the
    refusal remained.  The appellant appealed.

3.   The grounds of appeal prepared by  the  solicitor  were  vague  but  Mr
    Chohan of counsel then  appeared  before  the  judge.   Mrs  Ahmed  was
    present in court and gave evidence.  The judge stated that she was  not
    satisfied that the sponsor had shown at the date  of  application  that
    she had �62,500 in her HSBC account for the previous six  months,  i.e.
    from 10 May 2013 to 10 November 2013.  She stated that  there  were  no
    bank statements for the period, May, June, August  or  September  2013.
    The statements produced showed a  balance  on  17  July  2013  of  only
    �139.42.  She also examined the bank account which the appellant had in
    Summit Bank, Karachi.  She said that the closing  balance  there  on  9
    September 2013 was R824,182, some �4,824 "and  the  statement  is  more
    than 28 days prior to the date of application, 10 October  2013".   She
    dismissed the appeal because she was not satisfied that paragraph E-ECP
    3.1 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules had been  met.   There  was
    then an appeal.

4.   The First-tier Judge who granted  permission  to  appeal  said  firstly
    that the appellant was required to show funds from May to November 2013
    but in fact the correct date was April to October 2013; secondly,  that
    it was arguable that the judge had erred  because  he  had  taken  into
    account the fact that the sponsor had three children in calculating the
    �62,500; and, thirdly, that it was arguable that overall the  appellant
    had available that amount  taking  into  account  the  amounts  in  the
    account with Summit Bank in Pakistan.

5.   Before us this afternoon Mr Chohan has accepted that the appellant  did
    have to meet the figure mentioned by the  judge,  namely  �62,500.   In
    other words, the judge was right and had not  taken  into  account  the
    children at all.  Then, with the help of Ms Brocklesby, Mr Chohan  took
    us through the accounts of  both  Summit  Bank  and  Mrs  Ahmed's  HSBC
    account.  It seems that the appellant was  making  substantial  savings
    from working in Saudi Arabia.  In April, the Summit Bank account showed
    relatively small amounts, at one point  equivalent  to  something  like
    �4,500.  By the end of May the amount was approximately �34,000, by  10
    June it was something like �53,000 and by 11 June, �64,000.  Mr  Chohan
    then showed us the transfer which occurred on 19 July from  the  Summit
    account into Mrs Ahmed's HSBC account.  That was in the sum of �72,984.



 6. Mr Chohan accepted that by applying paragraph 11 of Appendix  FM-SE  of
    the Immigration Rules it was necessary to demonstrate that  during  the
    six month period the �62,500 amount had been  met.   Realistically,  he
    accepted that in the early months of that six month period  the  figure
    had not been reached combining both accounts.  Through the  appellant's
    work in Saudi Arabia those savings were accumulated.  Certainly in  the
    last months of that six month period, looking  at  both  accounts,  the
    figure had been met.  Mr Chohan submitted that if  one  looked  at  the
    date of decision the amount was there in the HSBC account.   The  whole
    aim of the rules was to avoid the appellant coming to this country  and
    then relying on public funds.  The  intention  of  the  rules  was  met
    because more than that sum was there in  the  account.   It  was  still
    there at the time of the decision and, in his submission, subsequently.
     Both the appellant and Mrs Ahmed were trying to maintain  family  life
    in difficult circumstances where the appellant was working in  a  third
    country.  Notwithstanding that the strict requirements of the rules had
    not been met discretion should have been exercised in  the  appellant's
    favour.

 7. We can sympathise with the plight of both the appellant and Mrs  Ahmed.
    We can see that since 2010 they  had  tried  to  make  the  best  of  a
    difficult situation.  The appellant has tried to build  up  savings  by
    working hard in a third country, Saudi Arabia.   Notwithstanding  that,
    we cannot see how the effect of the rules can be  avoided.   The  plain
    fact is that the �62,500 target was not met over the period of the  six
    months as required by the rules.  The judge was right.  The only course
    seems to be for the appellant to re-apply.
