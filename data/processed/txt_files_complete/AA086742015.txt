                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of Iraq born  in  1984.   He  appeals  with
    permission[1] the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Alis)
    dated 29th February 2016 to dismiss his appeal[2] against a decision to
    refuse to grant him protection.




    Anonymity Order

 2. This case concerns a claim for  international  protection.  Having  had
    regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders  I
    therefore consider it appropriate to make an  order  in  the  following
    terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"






    Background and Matters in Issue


 3. The Appellant came to the United Kingdom in January 2014 with leave  to
    enter as a Tier 4 (General)  Student  Migrant.  He  claimed  asylum  in
    December of that year. The Appellant claimed  to  have  a  well-founded
    fear of persecution in  Iraq  for  reasons  of  his  imputed  political
    opinion. He is a medical doctor and  comes  from  a  family  of  highly
    educated professionals. His father was a prominent academic  pharmacist
    who was assassinated in 2004. The  Appellant  believes  that  this  was
    because he was a scientist, a member of the Ba'ath party and known  for
    his secular lifestyle.  The Appellant now fears that Islamist  militias
    will do him serious harm because of his association with his father and
    the Ba'athist regime, his own agnostic attitudes and the fact  that  he
    is a doctor. He claims to have personally  received  threats  or  faced
    attack in 2011, 2013 and 2014.    His claim for asylum was prompted  by
    an attack on the family home in Basra in December 2014.


 4. The Respondent accepted that the Appellant was  an  Iraqi  doctor.  The
    remainder of the account was rejected and asylum refused.

 5. By the time that the appeal came before the First-tier  Tribunal  there
    had been a development in the case.  On  the  day  of  the  appeal  the
    Appellant relied on the evidence he had given to  the  Respondent,  but
    added that he had now converted to Christianity. In addition to his own
    testimony the Appellant relied  on  a  number  of  documents,  and  the
    Dorodian evidence of three Christians, including two Church of  England
    vicars who attested to their belief that the Appellant  was  a  genuine
    believer in the Christian faith.  The Appellant further  relied  on  an
    expert report by Dr Rebwar Fatah.

 6. In its assessment of the alleged  conversion  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    found the three Dorodian witnesses to  be  sincere  and  credible.   It
    expressly accepted that they genuinely believed the Appellant  to  have
    converted. The Tribunal found,  however,  there  to  be  factors  which
    pointed in the other direction: these were the timing and the fact that
    the Appellant had insisted on being baptised very quickly.  Taking  all
    of this evidence in the round, the Tribunal was not satisfied that  the
    Appellant had discharged the burden of proof in respect of his claim to
    have become a Christian.  As for the claim as originally advanced,  the
    Tribunal found there to be inconsistencies  in  the  evidence  and  the
    documents provided,  but  proceeded  to  assess  the  claim  about  the
    Appellant's father 'at its highest' [�69].    The Tribunal found  there
    to be a significant difference in the country conditions  between  2004
    and the present day. It records the evidence of the  expert  report  as
    making clear that "problems for people connected to  the  Ba'ath  party
    are now minimal and the expert also accepts that there was no  evidence
    of who killed his father or why".  Noting that the Appellant managed to
    continue with his studies after the death of his  father  and  to  then
    obtain work as a doctor without experiencing any problems the  Tribunal
    concludes: "there  is  nothing  in  the  expert  report  or  background
    material that would have placed this appellant in any risk category for
    being his father's son as evidenced by the fact that  he  was  able  to
    study and to go to work" [�71].   The documentary evidence is found  to
    be "limited", with the Tribunal noting that police reports referred  to
    elsewhere have not been  supplied.    Overall  the  Tribunal  concluded
    there to be no risk of  harm  to  the  Appellant  and  the  appeal  was
    dismissed.


 7. The grounds of appeal are:

        i)  that  the  Tribunal  has   misconstrued,   ignored   and   made
           contradictory findings on  the  evidence  of  alleged  Christian
           conversion; and


       ii) committed the same errors in respect of the  expert  report  and
           documentary evidence.




    Discussion and Findings


 8. I heard submissions on the grounds, and the Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department's defence of the determination,  on  the  11th  January
    2017.    The challenge that was made related  to  three  areas  of  the
    evidence: the Appellant's claimed conversion to Christianity, the  risk
    he might face through association with his  Ba'athist  father  and  the
    risk he might face himself as a  secular  or  'westernised'  doctor  in
    Basra. I adopt that thematic approach in my findings.




    Risk as a Christian

 9. In respect of the  claimed  conversion  the  ratio  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision was that notwithstanding the good faith shown in  the
    Appellant by his Dorodian witnesses, the timing of his claim  was  such
    that the Tribunal could not accept it  to  be  genuine.   The  relevant
    chronology is as follows. The Appellant claimed asylum in December 2014
    and by the end of April 2015 had been  interviewed  and  refused.   The
    Appellant states that he became interested in Christianity as early  as
    July 2015, and was baptized in November 2015.  The  Appellant  informed
    his solicitors of his  conversion  in  November.   The  Respondent  was
    informed about it in a letter dated 1st December 2015, but full witness
    statements and  corroborative  evidence  were  not  supplied  with  the
    bundles that were lodged on the 22nd February 2016. They were filed and
    servced over the days that followed.


10. The First-tier Tribunal identified two  potential  negative  inferences
    that could be drawn from that chronology.  The first was the suggestion
    that the  Appellant  and  his  representatives  had  taken  a  tactical
    decision not to furnish the Respondent or Tribunal with the particulars
    of their case until very  shortly  before  the  hearing:  the  evidence
    started arriving on the 22nd February 2016, and the hearing was on  the
    26th.  The  effect  of  this  was  to  deprive  the  Respondent  of  an
    opportunity of testing the Appellant's evidence before the matter  came
    to trial.  This is what the determination alludes to at �62  where  the
    First-tier Tribunal states "I do have concerns about this behaviour and
    his failure to raise this part of his claim with the  respondent  prior
    to the current hearing but I  have  not  held  this  against  him  when
    assessing the genuineness of his  conversion".    The  second  negative
    inference that was drawn relates  to  relative  haste  with  which  the
    Appellant managed to get baptised. This was a matter that did very much
    trouble the Tribunal: see �61.

11. It is perhaps evident from the foregoing that I find  there  to  be  no
    contradiction in the findings at �61 and �62.  The point was  that  the
    Tribunal was not going to take  any  procedural  issue  with  the  late
    disclosure, but found as a matter of  substance  that  the  very  quick
    conversion was not worthy of belief. That was a finding rationally open
    to the  Tribunal.   Four  months  from  nascent  interest  to  official
    recognition was, by any standards,  a  fairly  speedy  transition  from
    agnosticism to a faith that the Appellant had hitherto had no  interest
    in.     I  find  no  material  error  in  the   First-tier   Tribunal's
    miscalculation that the relevant period was  three,  nor  four  months.
    The decision would unarguably have been the same either way.

12. Mr Galvin placed some  emphasis  in  his  submissions  on  the  alleged
    failure of the Tribunal to take into account the evidence of  'Reverend
    T'. Reverend T is said to have given evidence that for someone like the
    Appellant, the church would normally look for evidence  of  six  weeks'
    church  attendance  before  baptism,  plus  completion  of  the  'Alpha
    course'. It is submitted that in making  its  assessment  the  Tribunal
    appeared to overlook that evidence, concentrating  on  the  alternative
    view expressed by 'Reverend A' that the church  would  normally  expect
    six months' attendance. It is submitted that in  analysing  the  latter
    and omitting to consider the former, the Tribunal erred in  law.  I  am
    not satisfied that this is so. First of all,  the  record  of  evidence
    does not bear out what is said  in  the  grounds  to  be  Reverend  T's
    evidence. Her evidence is recorded at �41 to be that the  period  would
    be three months. Secondly it is very difficult to see how the  decision
    would have been any different, even if the  shorter  period  of  church
    attendance had been taken as the norm. Judge Alis had plainly concluded
    that the Appellant had done all he could to secure  a  baptism  with  a
    view to being able to reply upon it at his asylum appeal. This view was
    informed by the uncontested evidence of all of the  Dorodian  witnesses
    that the Appellant was baptised quickly and that this had been upon his
    own insistence.

13. The final complaint under this head was that the Tribunal  misconstrued
    the evidence of the Dorodian witnesses about how  well  they  knew  the
    Appellant. In particular it is  submitted  that  the  Tribunal  made  a
    mistake of fact in its recording of their evidence  at  �61(iv),  where
    the Tribunal gives the following reason  for  declining  to  place  any
    significant weight on their evidence:

         "The  fact  the  witnesses  knew  nothing  about  the   appellant's
         activities outside  of  the  church  and  that  they  believe  that
         everyone who approaches them is genuine"

14. Mr Galvin asked me to look carefully at the evidence that the witnesses
    gave. The grounds submit that Reverend A had said  that  he  meets  the
    Appellant outside of Church on Fridays when they would go to a caf�  or
    go for a walk; Reverend T in her evidence had  stated  that  she  fully
    understood that people can come to Church with ulterior motives such as
    getting their child into a church school; the team in the  church  have
    meetings about new members of the congregation in order to discuss such
    concerns.  In response Mr McVeety agreed that it was important  that  I
    looked at the actual evidence. This, he submitted, would reveal that in
    fact the evidence was not as it is portrayed in the grounds. He  has  a
    point.  The witness statements say nothing at  all  about  any  of  the
    matters touched upon at �61(iv). The typed transcript in the Record  of
    Proceedings shows that Reverend T  gave  evidence  that  she  only  has
    contact with  the  Appellant  at  church  and  in  response  to  cross-
    examination agreed "I can't say what he does  away  from  me".   Whilst
    Reverend A does confirm that he met the Appellant for  a  coffee  on  a
    Friday the remainder of his evidence is, in essence, as it is  recorded
    in  the  determination.  Asked  whether  he  knew  anything  about  the
    Appellant Reverend A said that he attends the church and is one if  its
    members.   Asked again "you have no idea if he leads a  Christian  life
    outside of Church?" the Reverend replied "all I can comment upon is his
    attendance".     The record further shows that Reverend A believes  the
    incidence of fraud in these cases to be "rare".   Having had regard  to
    that  record  and  the  statements  I  am  not   satisfied   that   the
    determination can be shown to have misrepresented the evidence.   Judge
    Alis was  entitled  to  place  some  weight  on  the  fact  that  these
    witnesses, however well intentioned, knew relatively little  about  the
    Appellant.


15. Overall I am satisfied that the decision  in  respect  of  the  alleged
    conversion cannot lawfully  be  disturbed.   The  Appellant  failed  to
    discharge the burden of proof.  There was no error in approach  to  the
    question of whether the Appellant has  converted  to  Christianity  and
    those findings of the First-tier Tribunal are preserved.



    Risk through association with father


16. Mr Galvin submits that the Tribunal erred in its conclusion that  there
    was "nothing" in the expert or country background material to place the
    Appellant in any risk category. Issue is taken with  that  finding,  at
    �71,  with reference to the following:


        . UNHCR guidelines are that  Ba'ath  party  members  may  still  be
          targeted in individual cases, and that doctors can be targets
        . Dr Fatah provides a list of murdered Ba'athists and confirms that
          doctors have been targeted, although the motive remains unclear
        . Dr Fatah offers several explanations for  why  the  frequency  of
          anti-Ba'athist attacks have declined


17. Dr Fatah does, as the grounds  contend,  provide  a  list  of  murdered
    Ba'athists. He also prefaces that list by the  remark:  "it  should  be
    noted that the reported instances of ex-Ba'athists being  killed  today
    are  very  rare  today".  The  evidence  in  this  case  was  that  the
    Appellant's father was murdered in 2004.  The  Tribunal  has,  for  the
    purpose of its risk assessment, accepted that to be the case: see  �69.
    Although  it  could  not  be  said  with  any  certainty  why  he   was
    assassinated, the Tribunal appears to accept at �70 that  it  may  have
    had something to do with his connections  to  the  Ba'ath  party.  What
    happens after that date is that the Appellant completes medical  school
    and embarks on his career.   On his own evidence nothing else  happened
    until 2011.   There was therefore a  seven  year  period  in  which  no
    adverse attention was shown to him as a result of his own connection to
    the party, or that of his late father. This was the context in which Dr
    Fatah's evidence about risk  and  "prominence"  had  to  be  read.  The
    Tribunal was entitled to conclude, as it does at �71, that the  absence
    of real risk on  account  of  Ba'ath  association  is  demonstrated  by
    Appellant's lack of any problems in those years  immediately  following
    the overthrow of Saddam Hussain.  The  fact  that  there  are  isolated
    instances of people still being targeted does not alter the  Tribunal's
    reasoning.  The Tribunal was  entitled  to  find  that  there  was  not
    sufficient risk arising simply from the family  name:   there  were  no
    recorded instances of any member of his family being  targeted  in  the
    aftermath of his father's murder.   Although I accept that  his  father
    was a Ba'athist (much documentary evidence of  this  is  supplied)  and
    that he was murdered in 2004,  I am unable to find that the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred in its approach to the question of current risk  arising
    purely from that connection.  I accept, as did Mr Harrison,  that  this
    family context may be relevant, insofar as it might be one contributing
    factor, to any current risk faced by the Appellant.




    Risk as a 'westernised' Doctor


18. Having discounted the contention that the Appellant faced a  real  risk
    of serious harm simply for some historical association with the  Ba'ath
    party the First-tier Tribunal  determination  proceeds  to  assess  the
    claim based on the Appellant's  "own  fears".  I  took  this  to  be  a
    reference to the suggestion that the claimed assaults in 2011, 2013 and
    2014 were targeted at the Appellant because of his status as  a  doctor
    and a scientist.   The analysis appears at paragraph 75 onwards.   Four
    reasons are given for rejecting this aspect of the claim:


              i)  That  there  are  no  police  reports,  contrary  to   the
                 information supplied by the Ministry of the  Interior,  and
                 no good reason has been advanced for their absence [�75 and
                 76].


             ii) The Appellant's departure from Iraq  on  the  30th  January
                 2014 is inconsistent with his claim that his residence  was
                 attacked by ten armed men just a few days earlier. Had that
                 event occurred the Appellant would have been too  concerned
                 for the welfare of his young family to  leave  them  behind
                 [�77].

            iii) The Appellant's claim to  have  had  no  contact  with  his
                 family since September 2015 was contradicted by that of the
                 Dorodian witnesses, who were all under the impression  that
                 he retained contact with his family [�78].

             iv) There was a  delay  in  making  the  claim.  The  Appellant
                 arrived in the United Kingdom in January 2014 and  did  not
                 claim asylum until his student visa was  about  to  expire,
                 some eleven months later [�79].

19. The primary subject of the challenge in the grounds is  the  conclusion
    at (i) above. The absence of the three police reports, numbered 398, 48
    and 903 was clearly a matter that weighed  heavily  in  the  Tribunal's
    assessment. Reference is made to ST (Corroboration -  Kasolo)  Ethiopia
    [2004] UKIAT 00119.  The grounds submit that the Tribunal misunderstood
    the evidence. It is submitted that the  documents  in  the  Appellant's
    bundle read together establish a trail of reports,  starting  with  the
    Appellant's mother making a complaint, followed by the National  Police
    Force in Basra and Qi  Dar  making  reports  to  the  Ministry  of  the
    Interior, which finally compiled the information  it  received  into  a
    composite report. It is submitted therefore that these police documents
    were in fact produced and had the Respondent or Tribunal had asked  for
    clarification, the 'paper trail' could have  been  explained,  and  the
    documents identified.


20. Following the 'error of law' hearing in January I was able to find  the
    letter from the Ministry of the Interior (in translation) at page 61 of
    the Appellant's bundle.   This does, as the Tribunal notes, refer to  a
    series of police reports.   At page 291 there  is  a  letter  from  the
    National Police Force  addressed  to  the  Ministry  of  the  Interior,
    introducing enclosures: "we hereby attach the documents relating to all
    detail concerned with incidents reported to Al Basra Police and Qi  Dar
    part of our Fourth Force Division, for your  attention  with  regards".
    It is dated 17th December 2014. A further  letter,  in  similar  terms,
    from the NPF in Qi Dar is dated the 27th December 2014.

21. Since these documents were possibly the 'police reports' that the First-
    tier Tribunal had found to be absent, I considered it arguable that the
    ground was made out, and asked that the parties come back for a further
    hearing to make submissions on the matter. I was unable to make a  more
    resolute finding at that stage since it was not  at  all  clear  to  me
    whether these were in  fact  the  missing  reports.   At  that  initial
    hearing Mr Galvin had relied simply  on  the  "grounds  as  drafted  by
    Counsel" which  were  unfortunately  hard  to  understand.   They  were
    drafted in maddeningly confusing terms, providing, for no good  reason,
    multiple references to the same document.

22. When the hearing resumed Mr Galvin was able to take  Mr  Harrison,  and
    then  the  Tribunal,  to  each  document  and  its  translation.   Both
    Respondent and Tribunal were  satisfied  that  these  were  the  police
    reports referred to in the Ministry's letter, and that they had been in
    the bundle before the First-tier Tribunal. There was therefore an error
    of fact in the determination and that ground of appeal was made out.

23. I should record that I was deeply uneasy about finding an error of  law
    here. It is plain from the determination that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    was in no way assisted by Counsel who appeared before it: "Mr Sills did
    not refer me to the police  reports  in  the  bundle  and  having  gone
    through those papers to see if such documents have been submitted I can
    find no trace of them". Where parties are legally represented it is  no
    part of the Judge's job to trawl through the documentary evidence in  a
    bundle of 343 pages and to work out which translation relates to  which
    original document, and what the relevance of each item might  be.   The
    proper course would have been for the documents to be  introduced,  and
    explained, by the Appellant in his evidence-in-chief.

24. All of that said the bundle did contain confirmation from police forces
    in Basra and Qi Dar that the events described were reported. The  blame
    for the poor presentation of the case cannot be laid at the door of the
    Appellant and it would plainly be in the interests of justice  that  he
    be given an opportunity to restate his case  on  the  claimed  risk  in
    Basra.   I so find because  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the  remaining
    reasons given in the First-tier Tribunal determination  are,  on  their
    own,  enough to justify the  overall  conclusion  that  the  events  in
    question did not take place. The Appellant might have left  his  family
    behind under the impression that the danger would be removed if he took
    himself out of the equation.  If  the  Appellant  has  lied  about  his
    current contact with his family, that is not to his credit but it  does
    not necessarily indicate that  he  was  lying  about  the  events  that
    occurred in 2011-2014. The section 8 point is only a good  one  if  the
    claimed events in December 2014 did not occur.

25. At the resumed hearing I heard  further  submissions  and  evidence  on
    whether the Appellant was, or is, at risk of persecution for reasons of
    his membership of  a  particular  social  group,  viz  a  'western'  or
    'secular' doctor.

26. The evidence, set out in the  Appellant's  asylum  interviews,  witness
    statements, oral evidence and supporting documents is as follows:

              i) The Appellant  was  born  in  Basra  into  a  middle  class
                 academic  family.   His   father   was   a   professor   of
                 pharmacology,  and  a  member  of  the  Ba'ath  party.  The
                 Appellant has produced a copy of his party membership cards
                 [at E2 & F4 Respondent's bundle],  letters  of  appointment
                 signed by Saddam Hussain and documents showing that he  was
                 the  Dean  of  Basra  university  [E4].   He  has  produced
                 numerous letters relating to his father's various  academic
                 appointments  [pages  118-246  Appellant's   bundle].   The
                 Appellant states that his father's family are  a  prominent
                 family  well-known  throughout  Iraq  for  their  religious
                 affiliations. His father was a "black spot on a white coat"
                 because  he  was  not  religious.  He   was   secular   and
                 nationalist in his  outlook,  and  so  were  his  immediate
                 family.


             ii) On the  22nd  November  2004  the  Appellant's  father  was
                 murdered. His pharmacy was surrounded by armed men in  cars
                 who fired  multiple  shots  into  the  building.  Witnesses
                 report that the men were dressed  as  police  officers  and
                 that they called their victim's name before they shot him;

                 The Appellant has produced a death certificate  issued  for
                 his father stating the cause of death to be  gunshot  wound
                 [E7]. In oral evidence he explained that  this  is  a  copy
                 produced by the local  registrar  at  the  request  of  his
                 mother.  The Appellant has  produced  a  google  search  of
                 murdered academics/scientists in Iraq, which  features  his
                 father's name [E70];

                 The police carried out  an  investigation  but  it  led  to
                 nothing.  The  Appellant  believes  that  his  father   was
                 targeted because he was secular and had been  a  member  of
                 the Ba'ath party.

            iii) The Appellant married in 2008. His wife is a pharmacist. In
                 December 2008 he qualified as  a  medical  doctor.  He  has
                 produced numerous documents attesting to his qualifications
                 and experience which are not in issue.


             iv) On the 21st April 2011 armed men dressed  in  "Arab  robes"
                 entered the Appellant's place of work, a primary healthcare
                 centre in Basra. They told staff that the Appellant  should
                 leave his post otherwise he would be  killed.    They  were
                 saying that he was the "son of a Ba'athi". The  manager  of
                 the centre informed the health directorate in Basra of this
                 incident and the Appellant was given  a  new  role  in  Al-
                 Naseriyah;

                 The police were informed but were unable to do anything.

              v) The Appellant moved to work in Al-Naseriyah. He would visit
                 his wife at her parents' home in Basra.

             vi) In 2012 the Appellant decided that he would apply  to  come
                 and take some further  study  in  the  UK.   He  made  some
                 preliminary enquiries into dermatology courses.

            vii) On 14th May 2013 the Appellant left his  workplace  in  his
                 car. He approached the junction on al-Rubaie  Street  where
                 he usually bought fish from a teenage  boy  who  sold  them
                 there. Two middle aged men in police uniform had set  up  a
                 checkpoint just beyond the vendor. The Appellant slowed his
                 vehicle to go round their cones. He was asked to leave  the
                 car and when he produced his ID he was told to turn around.
                 He was beaten over the back of the neck with an object.  He
                 does not know what  it  was  but  it  was  very  hard.  The
                 Appellant was bent double and vomited. The men jumped  back
                 away from the vomit and the Appellant took his chance -  he
                 ran and got back into his car. Another vehicle  had  pulled
                 up at the checkpoint in between his car and the men  so  he
                 was able to drive away. He returned  to  the  hospital  and
                 informed the manager there. The  police  came  and  took  a
                 statement. They also took a statement from the boy who sold
                 fish. The Appellant stayed  in  a  different  part  of  the
                 hospital from where he normally worked for about 12  hours,
                 until a colleague drove him to his father-in-law's house;


                 The Appellant stayed there for two days. He  was  still  in
                 pain and had numbness in his arm - he was terrified that he
                 was going to suffer paralysis and decided  to  get  an  MRI
                 scan at a private clinic. He was told that  he  has  severe
                 cervical spinal stenosis; the Appellant believes that  this
                 resulted from the attack;


                 The Appellant told the officer at his asylum interview that
                 he had not recognised the men  at  the  checkpoint  but  he
                 believes that they were after him. He thinks  that  because
                 there are "thousands" of doctors in that area and yet he is
                 the only one to have been targeted;

                 After this incident the Appellant arranged for  his  mother
                 and sister to go and live with an aunt in her house on  the
                 university campus.

           viii) The Appellant subsequently travelled to Jordan and  Lebanon
                 for treatment. Whilst in Jordan he decided  to  see  if  he
                 could pursue his idea of studying in the UK. He  wanted  to
                 get out of Iraq just until things  had  "calmed  down".  He
                 emailed the University of Hertfordshire  who  accepted  him
                 into a course;

             ix) On the 25th January 2014 the Appellant's wife gave birth to
                 their second child;

              x) On the 26th January 2014 the Appellant was at the  hospital
                 with  his  wife  when  he  received  telephone  calls  from
                 security staff at the local  radio  station  close  to  his
                 house. They told him that  more  than  ten  armed  men  had
                 broken into his house and  were  asking  people  where  the
                 Appellant was. The security guard had asked them  why  they
                 wanted to speak with the Appellant: a  man  just  told  him
                 that they were looking for him. The  Appellant  immediately
                 arranged for his wife and the baby to be  discharged.  They
                 went to her father's house. The Appellant and a friend  who
                 was a police officer went to the house. The men  had  gone.
                 They had broken the front and kitchen doors but  had  taken
                 nothing.

                 After this incident  the  Appellant's  mother  insisted  on
                 moving back into her home. She did not want it to be empty.
                 The Appellant and his brother tried to dissuade her but she
                 would not have it.

             xi) On the 27th January 2014 the appellant  received  visa  DHL
                 his passport with the UK visa endorsement inside it. He and
                 his wife agreed that it would be safer for the family if he
                 left Iraq until the situation had calmed down;

            xii) He arrived in Manchester on the 29th January 2014;


           xiii) On the  10th  December  2014  his  family  home  (i.e.  his
                 father's home)  was  targeted  by  armed  militiamen.  They
                 demanded to know where the Appellant was.  The  Appellant's
                 mother told them that he had gone abroad. They said that if
                 he did not show his face,  his  brother  would  be  killed.
                 The Appellant asked a friend who is  a  police  officer  to
                 investigate  this  incident.  He  went  to  the  house  and
                 reported to the Appellant what damage  had  been  done,  ie
                 they had broken down the door and  smashed  the  microwave.
                 This friend gave  the  Appellant  a  different  version  of
                 events from what his mother had told him - she had tried to
                 hide the true extent of the incident from him

                 The  Appellant's  brother  has  now  left  Iraq,  and   his
                 whereabouts are unknown;


                 After this incident the Appellant's mother  reiterated  her
                 complaints to the police about the various assaults on  her
                 family. This resulted in a letter from the police in Qi Dar
                 writing to acknowledge her complaint, which also refers  to
                 the earlier complaint made in respect  of  the  Appellant's
                 assault at the checkpoint in May 2013.  The  police  letter
                 confirms that the  Appellant  was  taken  to  hospital  for
                 treatment on that occasion [at E11]. The  police  in  Basra
                 also wrote to acknowledge that she had  filed  a  complaint
                 with them, this time reiterating that her husband had  been
                 killed on the  22nd  November  2004,  that  armed  men  had
                 attended the hospital looking for her son  in  April  2011,
                 and that on the 26th January  2014  armed  men  had  raided
                 their home. The police letter refers  to  statements  taken
                 from hospital nursing staff in the April 2011 incident  who
                 reported that the armed men had said that  they  wanted  to
                 kill the Appellant [E18][3] . These letters,  from  Qi  Dar
                 and Basra police forces, were forwarded to the  Appellant's
                 mother under cover of letter from the Ministry of  Interior
                 [E15]

            xiv) The Appellant and is wife are now divorced.  The  Appellant
                 became visibly distressed at hearing when he  talked  about
                 this. He said that she had done the best thing she could do
                 to distance herself and their children from  him.  She  and
                 the children live in her parents' home in Basra. She runs a
                 pharmacy that was owned by the Appellant's father (it bears
                 his  family  name).  She  shares  the  profits   with   the
                 Appellant's mother and sister; they all know what  she  has
                 been through because of  association  with  him,  and  they
                 remain on good terms, but he finds it extremely distressing
                 that they remain in Iraq. He  is  worried  about  them  and
                 misses his children a great deal.


27. The Appellant relies on two expert reports. The first was written by Dr
    Rebwar Fatah on the 2nd December 2015, the second by Dr Alan George  on
    the 20th April 2017. The Respondent challenges  neither  the  expertise
    nor objectivity of these reports.


28. Insofar as it is relevant to my enquiry the evidence of Dr Fatah is  as
    follows:

        . Attacks on ex-Ba'athists are very rare today but it  is  possible
          that  a  particularly  well  known  family  might  be  at   risk,
          particularly in those communities  with  a  particular  animosity
          towards the former regime,  viz  Kurds  and  Shi'a.  A  suspected
          Ba'athist was shot dead in Basra on the 8th October 2013


        . Dr Fatah opines that there is a low recorded incidence of  former
          Ba'athists being discriminated  against  or  persecuted  in  Iraq
          today because there are often other, additional, reasons why they
          were  targeted  which  might  feature  more  prominently  in  the
          reports; many high profile Ba'athists have been captured,  killed
          or have left the country

        . Many academics were killed  following  the  overthrow  of  Saddam
          Hussain but it is not possible to say whether it was  because  of
          their work, or because of their inevitable association  with  the
          Ba'ath party (they would not have  had  jobs  if  they  were  not
          members)

        . Anti-Ba'athist rhetoric has been used as  a  cover  for  ulterior
          political motives. For  instance  those  protesting  against  the
          Shi'a dominated government have been branded "pro-Ba'athist"  and
          this has been used as a  pretext  to  arrest  them  or  otherwise
          suppress dissent

        . The Appellant's  family  are  a  "noble  and  reknowned"  family,
          producing many social, religious and political figures  including
          a Grand Ayatollah of the Shi'a faith

        . Publicly displaying beliefs or attitudes  antithetical  to  Islam
          "can  put  one  at  serious  risk"  in  a   permissive   security
          environment where armed groups have an opportunity to  perpetrate
          acts of hostility against such individuals.  This  would  be  the
          case wherever the Appellant lived in Iraq


29. Dr George adds this:


        . The account is plausible in light of  what  is  known  about  the
          situation in Iraq at the material times.  For  instance,  in  the
          years following the fall of the regime  "medical  personnel  were
          targeted relentlessly for murder and kidnap by insurgents as part
          of  a  wider  campaign  against  professional  people,  with  the
          apparent objective of hindering the Baghdad government's  efforts
          to restore public services"


        . In Iraq today there could be a risk to the Appellant as a doctor,
          but this risk would  not  be  significant  other  than  in  areas
          controlled by IS

        . There could be a risk to the Appellant as someone  identified  as
          Shi'a in Sunni-dominated areas such as Baghdad

        . He would be regarded as a prime candidate for kidnapping, because
          having spent a considerable amount of time  abroad  he  would  be
          perceived as wealthy

        . The security situation in Baghdad is "nothing short of dire"

        . "The tribal and clan based  nature  of  Iraqi  society,  and  the
          associated tendency for people to live in close communities based
          on clan and tribe mean  that  newcomers  to  a  locality  attract
          attention. Residents tend to be curious about the  background  of
          newcomers  and  to  ask  questions.  This  tendency  has   become
          especially marked with the breakdown of law  and  order  in  Iraq
          since the 2003  invasion.  The  fear  that  now  permeates  Iraqi
          communities has made people acutely suspicious of strangers.  The
          tribes  and  clans  constitute  highly  effective   channels   of
          communication. By means of tribal contacts, a pursuer can  locate
          his quarry with relative ease..."


30. The extant country guidance is AA (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG  [2015]  UKUT
    544 (IAC).   Dr Fatah's evidence that violence in the south of Iraq was
    rare (in comparison to the 'contested areas') was accepted; there  were
    recorded to have been 128 deaths arising from "security  incidents"  in
    the city during 2014 [at 114].


31. The latest 'Country information and Guidance' issued by the Home Office
    in respect of Ba'athists was published in November 2016. It notes  that
    since anyone with any  job  of  influence  under  the  old  regime  was
    required to be a member of the party, there is unlikely to  be  a  risk
    arising from any association [6.4.1].  There may however remain a  risk
    if the individual - or persons associated with him - had  a  particular
    prominence, and that this may be a contributing factor to current risk:

         6.4.2 The DIS FFM were told that former membership of the Ba'ath
         party is not a determining factor when it comes to the question of
         whether or not a person would be targeted, and that: 'There are
         only few examples of assassinations of former Baath party members
         and since 2008 this issue has been 'minimal''. The International
         Organisation for Migration (IOM), who were interviewed, were not
         aware of people currently being targeted for this reason. However,
         UNHCR Iraq considered: 'Depending on function and level, former
         Baathists may still be targeted. A former Baathist affiliation
         could be an element that is cumulative in putting a person at risk
         of being targeted. However, some individuals have been targeted
         solely on the basis of former Baathist affiliation.'

         6.4.3 The DIS FFM also noted:


         'Former Baathists who have been involved in human rights violations
         and where this is known could be at risk [of being targeted]. UNHCR
         - Iraq, Baghdad considered that relatives of pre-2003 prominent
         figures who have been involved in human rights violations would not
         consider it safe to return to Iraq.


         'Regarding former Baathists party members and affiliates, a
         reliable source [in] Iraq stated this issue is like opening a
         Pandora's Box and it is very complex when it comes to assessing
         whether a person is at risk of being targeted for this reason.'


         6.4.4 The same report also recorded that an international NGO in
         Amman stated that senior Ba'ath party members are targeted
         especially in south Iraq and some central parts. However, such a
         person would need to be well-known to others and other factors such
         as having occupied a particular exposed position are likely to have
         influence the risks as well.
         6.4.5 It also cited a source who stated that in relation to
         'whether or not relatives to persons threatened or attacked due to
         their professional background or Baathist affiliation may be at
         risk from armed groups or criminal gangs as well' and that
         'everything is possible.'




         6.4.6 In its 2012 Eligibility Guidelines, the UNHCR identified
         perceived political opponents as a risk category, noting:
         'Political opponents are allegedly arrested arbitrarily on vague
         terrorism-related charges, often coupled with accusations of Ba'ath
         Party ties or corruption'.



         Furthermore: 'While armed Shi'ite groups have in the past publicly
         focussed on attacking the MNF-I/USF-I [Multi-National Forces-
         Iraq/US Forces-Iraq], there are reports that they also single out
         Iraqis of various profiles for kidnapping and assassination,
         including former Ba'athists...'

32.  I have considered all of that evidence in the round and  have  applied
    the lower standard of proof applicable. In reaching my decision I  have
    found that the following matters weigh in the Appellant's favour:


              i) The detailed evidence that the Appellant  has  given  about
                 his experiences in Iraq  has  been  internally  consistent,
                 across his asylum interviews, detailed  witness  statements
                 and cross examination before the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
                 myself;

             ii) The evidence that the Appellant has given  is  corroborated
                 by a very large volume of documentary evidence (not all  of
                 which has been referred to herein);

            iii) I am satisfied that the evidence  that  the  Appellant  has
                 given is  not  inconsistent  with  the  country  background
                 evidence. Although there is plainly  not  a  high  rate  of
                 violence in Basra, in comparison with areas in  the  north,
                 there  are  still  incidents  of  targeted  violence   (for
                 instance,  128  deaths  in  2014).  The  Respondent's  COIR
                 highlights that the risk from association with the B'athist
                 regime, such that it is, may be a particular  risk  in  the
                 south of Iraq

33. The matters that may be  weighed  against  him  include  those  matters
    raised in the reasons for refusal letter and that:


             iv) The First-tier Tribunal found that the Appellant  had  not,
                 as he claimed, converted to Christianity;


              v) The general level of risk in Basra is lower than  in  other
                 parts of Iraq


34. Having considered those matters in the round I am  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant is telling the truth about his past experiences in Iraq.  His
    asylum interview was long (over five hours) and  I  am  struck  by  the
    level of detail that he was able to give. I have kept in mind that  the
    Appellant is an intelligent man and that it is  possible  that  he  has
    concocted this account and  had  the  myriad  of  supporting  documents
    prepared by forgers in order to bolster it.  He would however  have  to
    be a very accomplished liar to have remained consistent throughout  and
    to have added vignettes such as the teenage boy who sold  fish  on  the
    crossroads at the end of al-Rubaie Street.   The situation in Basra  is
    of course much better than in other parts of the country (where all-out
    war rages), and I have heeded the expert evidence that the risk to  the
    Appellant, in any of the categories that he might be said to  fall,  is
    generally a low one. But that risk exists, and  having  considered  his
    evidence with anxious scrutiny I am satisfied that he has been  telling
    the truth.


35. I accept and find as fact that the Appellant has been targeted by armed
    men on four  occasions.  The  first  two  incidents  suggest  that  the
    Appellant was under attack because of his work as a  doctor.  In  April
    2011 armed men came to the health centre where he worked. In  May  2013
    he was assaulted whilst leaving the  hospital  to  which  he  had  been
    transferred. In January and December 2014 however, the men came to  the
    Appellant's family home in Basra.  References were made, on  more  than
    one occasion, to the Appellant's father.   This suggests that there are
    a number of motivations for this persecution. I note the assessment  of
    the Danish Immigration Service (cited at 6.4.3 of the  COIR)  that  the
    reasons for risk can be complex. The Appellant is from a very prominent
     Shi'a family  who  are,  Dr  Fatah  confirms,  well  known  for  their
    religious orthodoxy.  It  is  possible  that  the  Appellant  is  being
    targeted by Shi'a militias because he  and  his  Ba'athist  father  are
    still considered to be "black spots on a white coat". It  may  be  that
    both he and  his  father  were  victims  to  the  anti-academic,  anti-
    professional policy waged by insurgents who want to see the  government
    fail.


36. Having found the Appellant to have suffered persecution in  the  recent
    past, I must apply paragraph  339K  of  the  Immigration  Rules  to  my
    forward-looking risk assessment:

         339K.  The  fact  that  a  person  has  already  been  subject   to
         persecution  or  serious  harm,  or  to  direct  threats  of   such
         persecution or such harm, will be regarded as a serious  indication
         of the person's well-founded fear of persecution or  real  risk  of
         suffering serious harm, unless there are good reasons  to  consider
         that such persecution or serious harm will not be repeated.

37. Are there good reasons to consider that the persecution  would  not  be
    repeated?  I cannot determine with any  degree  of  certainty  who  the
    agents of persecution are, nor the possibly "complex" reasons why  they
    have pursued the Appellant. In the context of the  Refugee  Convention,
    and the lower standard of  proof,  neither  of  these  lacunas  in  the
    evidence appear  to  be  particularly  important.  Since  there  is  no
    evidence before me to indicate that the situation in Basra has improved
    to any significant degree since  2014[4],  and  no  evidence  that  the
    police have managed to make any in-roads into their investigations into
    the attacks, I must assume that the terrorists in  question  remain  at
    large, and remain able to operate. I  find  that  the  Appellant  would
    continue to be at risk in the South of Iraq, having  been  targeted  in
    both Basra and al-Nasiriyah.


38. The question then arises of whether the Appellant could safely relocate
    to another part of Iraq. The governates of Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk,  (aka
    Ta'min), Ninewah and Salah Al-din are currently found to be 'contested'
    by the applicable country guidance, and I must find that  there  exists
    there  a  real  risk  of  serious  harm  for  ordinary  civilians.  The
    Respondent accepted before me that the Independent Kurdish Region (IKR)
    would not be a realistic option for this appellant, coming as  he  does
    from the Arab south and with no discernible links to the  region.    It
    is however submitted that Baghdad would be a place of  safety  for  the
    Appellant.

39. I have considered the Appellant's personal  characteristics.  He  is  a
    medical doctor. His family name identifies him as being  a  Shi'a  from
    the south. As Dr Fatah explains, this name is of a "very high profile",
    with relatives of the Appellant having enjoyed a high degree of success
    in the religious, social and political spheres in  Iraq.  Their  number
    would include his father, an accomplished academic publicly  identified
    as a Ba'athist.  The Appellant has no connections or family in Baghdad,
    and would  be  a  returnee  from  the  west.  I  therefore  assess  the
    likelihood of harm to someone with this profile in the city.

40. I bear in mind the evidence of both Dr Fatah and Dr  George  about  the
    sense of fear that pervades communities in Iraq,  where  newcomers  are
    readily identifiable.    The expert witnesses  in  this  case  were  in
    agreement that each of the individual personal characteristics  of  the
    Appellant placed him at some risk, albeit that none could  on  its  own
    establish that risk to be substantial enough to  warrant  international
    protection: he faces some risk as a medical professional, he faces some
    risk as an incomer, some as a Shi'a, some as a returnee from the  West,
    and some as a member of his family.  Mr Galvin urged me to undertake  a
    cumulative and holistic evaluation of all of these matters,  and  I  am
    satisfied that that must be the right approach.  This is a man who  has
    already been deemed to have sufficient profile to attract  the  adverse
    attention of a militia in the south who have pursued him with malignant
    intent over a three year period and in two separate cities. He  retains
    all of the characteristics that he  had  at  that  time,  and  has  the
    additional difficulty of being one returned from  the  west,  with  the
    attendant risk of kidnap. Applying the lower standard  of  proof  I  am
    satisfied that it would not be reasonable, or safe, to  return  him  to
    Baghdad.




    Directions

41. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law and is
    set aside to the limited extent identified above.


42. The decision is remade as follows:


    "The appeal is allowed on asylum grounds.


    The Appellant is not entitled to humanitarian protection because he  is
    a refugee.


    The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds."


43. There is an order for anonymity.

[3] There is a translation of this document at E13 of the Respondent's
bundle. This states that the Appellant's father was killed because he was
the Dean of the Faculty of Pharmacy and because he is a "Muslim cleric".
The Appellant was asked about this at his asylum interview. He denied that
his father was a cleric, or that the police had written that. He said that
the translator employed by his solicitor had made a mistake; the Home
Office interpreter looked at the Arabic original and agreed that this was
so.  the Arabic original simply states that he was a Dean at the university
and says nothing about him being a Muslim cleric.
