Representation:

For the appellant:           Mr I Rene, of Counsel, instructed by
                       Lawson Adefope, Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr A Hutton, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The Secretary of State appeals with leave against the determination of
      an Adjudicator, Mr D J Jefferson, who allowed the respondent's  appeal
      against refusal of asylum and refusal to grant leave to enter.

   2. The appeal was dismissed both on asylum and on human  rights  grounds,
      with an adverse credibility  finding.   Confusingly,  the  Adjudicator
      also made a recommendation that the appellant not be returned to  Iraq
      until it was possible to be confident that he would not be at risk  if
      returned there.

   3. The grounds of appeal assert that the Adjudicator misdirected  himself
      in law by applying the wrong standard of proof, by  not  applying  the
      Chiver decision, by attaching insufficient weight to an arrest warrant
      produced by the appellant at the hearing (which is not on the file and
      is not before the Tribunal),  and  in  finding  that  the  appellant's
      claimed fear of persecution was for a non-Convention reason.

   4. The Tribunal has taken into account the grant of leave  and  read  the
      determination.    By  agreement  with  the  representatives  of   both
      parties, we analyse the risk to this appellant as though he were to be
      returned today, and we treat his core  account  as  credible  for  the
      purpose of establishing whether  the  arguments  put  forward  on  the
      appellant's behalf would now make a material difference to the outcome
      of  his  appeal.    There  has  plainly  been  a   great   change   in
      circumstances in Iraq since 27 November 2002 when  this  determination
      was promulgated, due to the war and  r�gime  change  effected  by  the
      Coalition.

   5. The core of this appellant's claim was that as a former member of  the
      PUK since 1999, he was sent to Sulaimaniyah to deliver a  letter  with
      two colleagues, was ambushed on the way, and that  one  colleague  was
      killed in the firing.  He escaped with his remaining colleague and was
      accused of treason by his local PUK commander, on the  basis  that  he
      was working for the KDP opposition. He contended below that  he  could
      not be safe either in the KDP area  of  the  Kurdish  Autonomous  Zone
      ('KAZ'), where he would be regarded as a traitor, or in the PUK  area,
      where he would still be regarded as an opponent.

   6. The appeal was heard on 2 October  2002,  just  days  before  the  re-
      establishment of the Kurdish Parliament and the beginning of a gradual
      reunification of the KAZ.   Progress has been steady since then.   The
      respondent's CIPU Country  Report  Bulletins  for  Iraq  in  2003  all
      reflect that the  KDP  and  PUK  have  agreed  to  merge  their  local
      administrations in a bid to weald greater influence in Iraq's national
      politics.   The PUK leader Jalal Talabani  was  chosen  to  travel  to
      Baghdad to represent all Kurds in a meeting with the Coalition forces.



   7. The Immigration Appeal Tribunal determination Mohammed (HX/13132/2001)
      promulgated as long ago as 20 December 2002  concluded  that  domestic
      protection was available within the two separate territories from  the
      KDP and the PUK.  The  Tribunal  has  considered  Bulletin  7/2003  of
      August 2003 which will no  doubt  shortly  be  incorporated  into  the
      October 2003 Country Report for the Secretary  of  State.   The  KDP's
      Nechirvan Barzani is the new Prime Minister of the  unified  Kurdistan
      Regional Government.  Adnan Mufti of the PUK will be his Deputy.


   8. On the present factual matrix in the  KAZ,  the  appellant's  argument
      simply cannot succeed today, since there is now  no  conflict  between
      the PUK and KDP in the region.  The present evidence is that  domestic
      protection is available across the KAZ and that given the end  of  the
      conflict and the co-operation between the KDP and  the  PUK  there  is
      simply no realistic prospect of risk to this appellant on return.  The
      respondent's CIPU Country Report Bulletins state clearly that  persons
      in the KAZ who have a localised  problem  can  safely  and  reasonably
      relocate within former KAZ to Kurdistan, and to limited areas  outside
      the former KAZ (3.14).

   9. Given the r�gime change in Iraq  proper,  and  the  current  de  facto
      occupation of Iraq by Coalition forces, it cannot  be  said  that  the
      Ba'ath Party hostility to Kurds in the north (whether  supporting  the
      KDP or the PUK) is now to be treated as a factor.

  10. It follows that even if the Adjudicator's determination  is  defective
      in the manner stated, that would not now affect the  outcome  of  this
      appeal.

  11. Appeal dismissed.
