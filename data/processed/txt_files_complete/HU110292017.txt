                         MORUFAT OMOLARA ANIFOWOSHE
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. On 26 September 2018, I wrote to the parties as follows:


         "In this case permission was sought on the basis of articles 2,  3,
         5 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It was granted
         on article 8, because it is arguable that the Judge  took  a  wrong
         approach to the best interests of the child.  It was refused on the
         basis of articles 2, 3  and  5  because  there  was  no  evidential
         support for any claim under those articles.


         The respondent has now indicated that he  will  withdraw  his  case
         opposing the appeal.  If that withdrawal is accepted, the  Tribunal
         would, without a hearing, set aside the judge's  dismissal  of  the
         appeal and  substitute  a  determination  allowing  the  appeal  on
         article 8 (EX.1) grounds only.


         As at present advised I propose to adopt that course of action, but
         will consider any submissions to the contrary  received  within  21
         days of the date of this letter."

 2. No submissions have been received.  I now set aside  the  determination
    of the First-tier Tribunal for error of law in that  the  judge  failed
    properly to apply the law to the determination of the article 8  claim.



 3. I substitute a determination allowing  the  appeal  on  the  article  8
    grounds only.



                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                              IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBER
                                                      Date: 30 October 2018.
