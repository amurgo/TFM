                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Goodman (the judge), promulgated on 19  October  2017,  in
         which she dismissed the appellant's appeal against the respondent's
         decision dated 19 August 2015 refusing  his  protection  and  human
         rights claims.


   Factual Background


      2. The appellant is a national of Gambia, date of birth 7 March  1981.
         In his statement dated 27 September 2017  the  appellant  maintains
         that he arrived in the UK in 2002. According  to  the  Reasons  for
         Refusal Letter however the appellant was granted leave to enter the
         UK in 2003. Further applications for leave  to  remain  as  a  work
         permit holder were unsuccessful and,  on  29  April  2008,  he  was
         deemed an  overstayer.  Also  in  April  2008,  the  appellant  was
         arrested for fraud and  sentenced  to  16  weeks  imprisonment.  He
         claimed asylum on 16  May  2008  based  on  his  alleged  political
         activity in Gambia. In June 2009 the appellant  received  a  second
         prison sentence for offences of  fraud  and  burglary.  His  asylum
         claim was refused on 15 September 2009 and an appeal  dismissed  on
         21  June  2010.  In  November  2010  the  appellant  made   further
         representations in respect of a fresh asylum claim, again based  on
         his political activities. On 25 January 2011 the respondent refused
         to accept these representations as a fresh  claim  under  paragraph
         353 of the immigration rules. Further representations were made  in
         respect of a new asylum claim, this time based on  the  appellant's
         homosexuality.


      3. In brief summary, the appellant claimed that he became  aware  that
         he was gay around the age  of  15.  Since  around  2003,  after  he
         entered the UK, the appellant formed friendships and  relationships
         with  several  men,  although  in  his  asylum  claim  of  2008  he
         maintained that he had been in a relationship with  a  woman  which
         lasted 2 to 3 years. The appellant  met  LR,  a  Jamaican  national
         recognised as a refugee based on his  sexual  orientation,  in  May
         2010, and they commenced a relationship  around  August  2010.  The
         appellant maintained that faced a real risk of  persecution  as  an
         openly gay man if returned to Gambia.


      4. The respondent did not accept  that  the  appellant  was  gay.  The
         appellant's relationship with  LR  was  considered  to  be  one  of
         friendship only. The respondent rejected the appellant's  claim  to
         be a member of a  Particular  Social  Group  based  on  his  sexual
         orientation. The respondent additionally rejected  the  appellant's
         article 8 claim.


The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

      5. The judge noted that the "real issue" in the appeal was whether the
         appellant was gay, and more particularly, in  a  relationship  with
         LR. The judge then identified the principle evidence before her and
         the  relevant  legal  framework.   Under   the   heading   "Factual
         Assessment" the judge considered the principal  factual  assertions
         constituting the  appellant's  claim  and,  on  several  occasions,
         analysed and commented on  that  evidence.  The  judge  considered,
         inter alia, evidence relating to and arising from  the  appellant's
         relationship  with  LR  (whose  name  she  occasionally  misspelt),
         evidence from "C" W (it is highly likely that the judge  meant  "D"
         W), a  close  acquaintance  of  LR,  evidence  of  the  appellant's
         observance as a Muslim, and the evidence of JM, a bisexual refugee.
         The judge additionally considered short letters written by  various
         individuals in 2013 and 2011 maintaining  that  the  appellant  was
         gay.


      6. In the section of her decision headed 'Discussion' the judge  found
         the evidence that the appellant was  in  a  long-term  relationship
         with "LB" (presumably the judge meant LR)  to  be  "not  altogether
         convincing" [42], even  taking  into  account  the  difficulty  the
         appellant may  have  experienced  in  acknowledging  his  sexuality
         because of his upbringing. The judge found that the  appellant  and
         LR did not seem to spend much  time  together  and  that,  "...  It
         appears doubtful that they have been seen [sic] each other even  as
         often as every other weekend, and there is very little detail about
         the nature of the relationship." The judge found there  was  little
         evidence  of  mutual  affection  and  held  against  the  appellant
         differences in evidence relating to the  giving  of  presents.  The
         judge found there was, "... little in  the  way  of  evidence  from
         other people, even CW [presumably the judge meant DW],  who  is  an
         old friend,  while  making  allowances  for  the  disappearance  of
         earlier supporters." The judge rejected  much  of  the  documentary
         evidence and found that the photographs of the "claimant" and "LRd"
         [presumably LR] were  "...  no  more  telling  of  an  intimate  or
         affectionate relationship than photographs taken with strangers  at
         demonstrations." The judge found the short letters dating from 2011
         and  2013  from  people  who  were  no  longer  contactable  to  be
         "uninformative". The judge held against the appellant discrepancies
         in his evidence  concerning  events  in  Gambia  and,  taking  into
         account his offences of dishonesty and his allegedly false claim to
         have been in a relationship with a woman for 2  ï¿½  years,  and  the
         delay in his asylum claim, the judge found that the  appellant  had
         not established, to a reasonable degree of likelihood, that he  was
         gay.




The challenge to the First-tier Tribunal's decision

      7. The grounds of appeal, as amplified  by  Mr  Chirico  in  his  oral
         submissions, content that the judge failed to  make  any  or  clear
         findings in respect of the evidence of DW  and  JM,  both  of  whom
         provided witness statements and gave oral evidence. There was  said
         to be inadequate, if any, engagement with their  evidence,  and  no
         material findings of fact were made. Nor were there  any  or  clear
         findings about the evidence of LR. The judge was additionally  said
         to have erred in law by drawing adverse inferences on the basis  of
         discrepancies when there were no actual discrepancies, and that the
         judge in properly  characterised  the  letters  from  a  number  of
         individuals  who  did  not  give  oral  evidence  as   "short   and
         uninformative".


      8. Ms Willocks-Briscoe submitted that the judge made specific findings
         from  [19]  to  [37]  identifying  a  number  of   inconsistencies,
         including  differences  in  evidence  relating  to  the  giving  of
         presents. The judge had been entitled to rely on  the  inconsistent
         evidence before her and she was entitled  to  reject  the  evidence
         that the appellant was gay for the reasons given.


      9. Having carefully considered the judge's decision and the  documents
         provided   by   both   parties,   and   having    considered    the
         representations, I indicated that  I  was  satisfied  the  decision
         contained material legal errors.

Discussion

     10. The judge's determination contains a number of typographical errors
         and misspellings of important witnesses. Some of the sentences  are
         also difficult to understand. This does not amount to a legal error
         but it does indicate that the judge did not adequately  reread  her
         decision before promulgation. Whilst I appreciate  the  significant
         pressures on judges to issue timely  decisions  the  production  of
         decisions containing a large number of errors suggests the case was
         not prepared with sufficient care.


     11. The judge found there was "little in the way of evidence from other
         people, even CW". Quite apart from getting his 1st name wrong,  the
         judge failed to engage with and make material factual  findings  in
         respect of the evidence from DW. In his evidence CW indicated  that
         he had known LR for 25 years, that LR was known on the gay scene as
         'Mother' that LR introduced the appellant as his  partner  in  2010
         and that they have been in a relationship since then. DW  described
         the appellant and LR as a committed couple, that the appellant made
         LR happy, and that  LR  talked  about  the  appellant  often.  This
         evidence is self-evidently relevant to  the  question  whether  the
         appellant and LR are in a relationship, and whether  the  appellant
         is gay. The judge however failed to make any sufficiently clear  or
         satisfactory findings in respect of this evidence. It is not  clear
         whether the judge accepted this evidence or rejected this  evidence
         and, if the latter, no reasons were provided  for  this  rejection.
         There was certainly no express finding that CW was a liar.


     12. Similar criticism can be made in respect of the judge's failure  to
         engage with the evidence from JM. In his statements  and  his  oral
         evidence JM described how the appellant had been very open with him
         about his sexuality in 2010, how difficult he found it to come  out
         as a gay man and how he spoke about his partner, Lincoln. This  was
         evidence that the appellant identified as  being  gay  in  private,
         that he  gave  a  consistent  account  of  his  coming  out  and  a
         consistent account of his relationship with LR. It was incumbent on
         the judge  to  engage  with  this  evidence  and  make  appropriate
         findings. The judge fails to do so. As a result, it  is  impossible
         to know what the judge made of this evidence. Her failure  to  make
         clear findings or to  give  reasons  for  rejecting  this  evidence
         amounts to a material error of law.


     13. Although the judge gave several reasons for finding the appellant's
         relationship with LR was weak, she failed to adequately engage with
         material aspects of LR's evidence. It was not disputed that LR is a
         LGBT  activist,  that  he  had  been  subjected  to   ill-treatment
         amounting to persecution in Jamaica, and that he said he would  not
         support somebody who was not gay having known what other black  gay
         men and lesbians go  through.  The  judge  failed  to  assess  this
         evidence. Nor has the judge made any clear finding whether LR is  a
         credible witness. I am also  persuaded  that  the  judge  may  have
         applied too high a standard of proof at [42] where she  found  that
         the appellant's evidence of  his  relationship  with  LR  was  "not
         altogether convincing". The appellant does not need to  'altogether
         convince' the Tribunal that he is gay, he only needs to demonstrate
         that there is a 'real risk' or a 'reasonable degree of  likelihood'
         that he is gay. While the judge may have  inadvertently  used  this
         phrase but still had the lower standard of proof in mind, she  then
         finds, in the same paragraph, that it "appears doubtful  that  they
         have been seen [sic] each  other  even  as  often  as  every  other
         weekend". It is not necessary  for  the  appellant  to  prove  that
         something is not 'doubtful', but rather that there is a  real  risk
         that it is true. Although the judge correctly  directs  herself  in
         respect of the burden and standard of proof at [15] and [43], I  am
         satisfied that her misdirections at [42] are sufficient  to  render
         the determination unsafe.

     14. It is apparent that there are a number of  inconsistencies  in  the
         evidence presented on the appellant's  behalf.  The  appellant  has
         offences  of  dishonesty  and  he  failed  to  mention  his  sexual
         orientation in his earlier asylum claims, which were  rejected.  It
         cannot however be said that, had the judge not committed the errors
         of law identified above, that her decision  would  inevitably  have
         been the same.


     15. Having considered the representations from both parties, and having
         regard to the section 7.2 of the Tribunal Practice Statement, I  am
         satisfied that the identified  errors  of  law  have  deprived  the
         appellant of a fair hearing and the First-tier  Tribunal's  factual
         findings are rendered unsafe. In these circumstances I consider  it
         appropriate to remit the case back to the First-tier  Tribunal,  to
         be heard afresh by a judge  other  than  judge  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Goodman.


Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal's decision is vitiated  by  material  legal  errors.
The case is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal  for  a  fresh  hearing
before a judge other than judge of the First-tier Tribunal Goodman.
