Representation:
Appellant:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Office presenting Officer
Respondent:   Mr K Nerry of John P Hagan Solicitors.


                            DECISION  AND REASONS

 1. By a decision dated 06 October 2014, the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  of
    Pam,  Azerbaijan  (hereinafter  the  "ECO")  refused  the  Respondent's
    application for clearance to enter the  United  Kingdom  as  a  fianc�e
    under Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  Appellant  is  a
    national of Azerbaijan, a lady aged 39  years.   At  the  time  of  the
    application, the Appellant's sponsor, her fianc�,  was  still  married.
    The plan  was  that  his  then  extant  divorce  proceedings  would  be
    completed in sufficient time to enable them to be married following the
    envisaged grant of entry clearance.  However,  for  reasons  which  are
    acceptable and understandable, the divorce proceedings did not progress
    at the  pace  contemplated.   While  non-compliance  with  the  funding
    requirement was a further reason for refusal initially, this was  later
    abandoned by the Entry Clearance Manager on review.  He identified  the
    sole issue of concern in the following terms:

         "With regard to  the  relationship  requirement,  the  sponsor  had
         previously been married and was not divorced from his former spouse
         ...

         I acknowledge that the  Appellant  submitted  a  divorce  petition,
         raised by the sponsor's spouse against him,  with  her  application
         ...  The relationship had permanently broken down and I am prepared
         to concede this element of the refusal notice ...

         [But] I am satisfied that the ECO was  correct  in  his  assessment
         that the couple would not be able to undergo a marriage in  the  UK
         within the validity of her visa."

 2. The First-tier Tribunal (the "FtT") allowed the Appellant's appeal,  in
    a paper exercise.  The Judge noted the twofold requirement of the Rules
    that entry must be sought to enable the marriage to take place and  any
    previous relationship of the  applicant  or  their  partner  must  have
    broken down permanently.  I emphasise the words in question because, in
    the original decision, the ECO misrepresented the  terms  of  the  rule
    and, in consequence, misdirected himself in  law  and  applied  a  non-
    existent requirement to the application.  The essence of his error  was
    to substitute sponsor for applicant or their partner.  His decision was
    unsustainable in law on this ground alone.  In any event, the  FtT  was
    satisfied that -

         "... there was very clear evidence that  the  relationship  between
         the sponsor and his former wife had  permanently  broken  down  ...
         [and] ...  that a speedy resolution of the divorce was  anticipated
         ...

         In actual fact, the decree absolute  was  pronounced  on  09  March
         2015, so they would have been  able  to  take  up  the  provisional
         booking at the Registry Office on 23 March 2015 if the  application
         had been allowed."

    The appeal was allowed in the following terms:

         "I find that the Appellant has met the requirements of E-ECP.1.1(d)
         and E-ECP.2.8.  The decision is not in accordance with the law  and
         the Immigration Rules."

 3. Even if the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Immigration  Rules  can  be
    construed so as to apply to the Applicant's sponsor, to  be  contrasted
    with the Applicant's former partner, there is no flaw in  the  approach
    of the FtT.  However, I conclude that the grant of permission to appeal
    is flawed, being based on a non-existent requirement to provide certain
    types of "evidence" required by the Rules.  While paragraphs 23 - 26 of
    Appendix FM/SE require a specific kind of evidence to be provided where
    it is claimed that a person is divorced or a civil partnership has been
    dissolved, this requirement has no  application  in  the  present  case
    since no such claim was made.  The grant of permission to  appeal  was,
    therefore, misconceived.



DECISION

 4. The decision of the FtT contains no error of law and is unassailable in
    consequence. I affirm it and dismiss the appeal.
