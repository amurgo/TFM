For the Respondents:       Mr Panikkar, Zenith Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. I refer to the Appellant in this appeal as the Secretary of State and
      the Respondents as the Claimants. The Claimants are nationals of India
      born on 8 March 1985 and 1 April 1983. The First Claimant made an
      application on 24 September 2014 for further leave to remain in the
      United Kingdom as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant. The Second Claimant is
      her dependent. I refer to the First Claimant as the Claimant in this
      decision. The Secretary of State refused the application on the
      grounds that the Claimant's TOIEC certificate from Educational Testing
      Service (ETS) was fraudulently obtained by the use of a proxy taker.
      Her scores from the test taken on 21 August 2012 were cancelled by
      ETS. The Secretary of State concluded that her presence in the UK was
      not conducive to the public good and that her conduct made it
      undesirable to allow her to remain in the UK. Her application was
      refused under paragraph 322 (2) and 322 (5) of the Immigration Rules
      because she had used deception in her application.


   2. The Claimants appealed against this decision to the First-tier
      Tribunal under section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
      Act 2002 (NIAA). In a decision promulgated on 4 July 2017 First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Frazer allowed the appeal finding that the Secretary of
      State had not discharged the legal burden of proving the Claimant to
      be dishonest. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal
      against this decision on the grounds that the First-tier Tribunal
      Judge had failed to give adequate reasons for her findings.

   3. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede on
      renewal to the Upper Tribunal on the grounds that there was arguable
      merit in the assertion that the Judge failed to give full and proper
      reasons for concluding that deception did not occur and accorded
      inappropriate weight to the first Claimant's ability to speak English,
      contrary to the observations made in MA (ETS - TOEIC testing) Nigeria
      [2016] UKUT 450.

The Grounds

   4. The grounds assert that in reaching the material finding the Judge
      relied on the Claimant's English language ability and other
      qualifications. As such, she was satisfied that she was entitled to
      take this into account in determining whether the Claimant had met the
      evidential burden in the case. The Judge placed weight on the fact
      that the Claimant was able to recall details of the examination
      process, however this did not mean the Claimant personally took the
      test. The BBC panorama programme showed students (at Eden College)
      standing next to terminals whilst proxy test takers took the test for
      them. The Judge did not refer to having seen this documentary which
      was provided on DVD to every hearing centre and may therefore not have
      been aware of the methods used which would not preclude the candidates
      from having travelled to the test centre and having knowledge of the
      procedures and contents of the test itself even though they had not
      taken it personally.


   5. The Secretary of State averred that there may be reasons why a person
      who was able to speak English to the required level would nevertheless
      cause or permit a proxy candidate to undertake an ETS test on their
      behalf or otherwise to cheat. The First-tier Tribunal had materially
      erred by failing to give adequate reasons for holding that a person
      who clearly spoke English would therefore have no reason to secure a
      test certificate by deception. It is submitted that the Judge's
      findings are inadequately reasoned.


The Hearing

   6. The appeal therefore came before the Upper Tribunal in order to
      determine whether there was an error of law in the decision of Judge
      Frazer and if so whether to set that decision aside.


   7. Mr Howells, in answer to my question, confirmed that the First-tier
      Tribunal Judge had not been provided with a copy of the DVD referred
      to in the grounds. She could not therefore be criticized for failing
      to take it into account. He submitted that the Judge's findings and
      conclusions were very brief. She found that the Secretary of State had
      discharged the evidential burden but not the legal burden. The legal
      burden was on the Secretary of State but case law had established a
      shift in the evidential burden. The innocent explanation provided by a
      Claimant had to meet a minimum level of plausibility. In this case the
      Judge found that the Secretary of State met the original burden but
      appeared to have been satisfied that the Claimant provided an innocent
      explanation. Considerable weight was given to the fact that she gave
      evidence in English and had a BSC from University of Sunderland and
      had nothing to gain to from using a proxy. The Secretary of State
      submitted that the Judge's finding were contrary to MA in which the
      Upper Tribunal noted that there were a range of reasons why a person
      proficient in English might engage in TOEIC fraud. The Upper Tribunal
      noted that there was no requirement to make a finding of why a person
      engaged in deception. Her findings were inadequate and ran contrary to
      the reported case of MA which was the leading authority on ETS cases.


   8. Mr Pannikar submitted that TOIEC cases were fact specific. In this
      Claimant's case the fact finding had been adequate. There was a big
      difference between this case and the case of MA. In MA there were many
      discrepancies in the evidence. That was not the case here.  The
      Claimant gave reasonable explanations which were accepted by the
      Judge. The fact finding was final and the case law supported the fact
      that the Claimant had discharged burden.

Discussion

   9. The grounds assert that the Judge's findings do not accord with the
      Judgment of the Upper Tribunal in MA. The grounds refer to paragraph
      57 of MA, which was part of the Omnibus Findings and Conclusions. The
      Upper Tribunal commented there:

         "Second, we acknowledge the suggestion that the Claimant had no
         reason to engage in the deception which we have found proven.
         However, this has not deflected us in any way from reaching our
         main findings and conclusions.  In the abstract, of course, there
         is a range of reasons why persons proficient in English may engage
         in TOEIC fraud.  These include, inexhaustively, lack of confidence,
         fear of failure, lack of time and commitment and contempt for the
         immigration system.  These reasons could conceivably overlap in
         individual cases and there is scope for other explanations for
         deceitful conduct in this sphere.  We are not required to make the
         further finding of why the Claimant engaged in deception and to
         this we add that this issue was not explored during the hearing.
         We resist any temptation to speculate about this discrete matter."

  10. There is no requirement in law that a Judge specifically direct
      him/herself that there are a range of reasons why a person proficient
      in English may engage in TOIEC fraud. As the Upper Tribunal made clear
      in the headnote in MA the question of whether a person engaged in
      fraud in procuring a TOEIC English language proficiency qualification
      will invariably be intrinsically fact sensitive.


  11. The Judge in this case correctly directed herself as to the burden and
      standard of proof, finding that the Secretary of State had discharged
      the evidential burden having had regard to the ETS evidence and the
      generic evidence. The Judge then considered at paragraph 10 whether
      the Claimant had provided an innocent explanation. The reasons for her
      finding that she had and that the Secretary of State had not discharge
      the legal burden of proving that she was dishonest were that she gave
      reasonable explanation for why she chose to attend a college 2 ï¿½ hours
      away from where she lived; her evidence was given in English and it
      sounded fluent; she had BSC in nursing from the University of
      Sunderland and was therefore capable of acquiring a degree
      qualification in English and that she would have had nothing to gain
      by using a proxy tester to sit her examination on her behalf. In
      coming to these conclusions the Judge took account of the evidence
      that she had heard from the Claimant and of the Secretary of State's
      submissions set out at paragraph 5 of the decision. There is no
      suggestion that she did not consider all of the reasons the Secretary
      of State advanced as to why it was said that the innocent explanation
      was not plausible. In summary therefore, she employed a fact sensitive
      approach to the evidence and gave reasons for finding in the
      Claimant's favour and accepting her account.


  12. The Secretary of State says that these reasons are not adequate.
      However, the Judge addressed all the Secretary of States points. She
      found that there were no discrepancies or inconsistencies in the
      Claimant's account. It has not been said that her findings were
      perverse. The Secretary of State criticises the Judge by saying that
      she failed to give adequate reasons for holding that a person who
      clearly speaks English would therefore have no reason to secure a test
      certificate by deception. However, the First-tier tribunal provided a
      number of reasons why she accepted the Claimant's account and the
      Upper Tribunal should be slow to interfere with findings on
      credibility when the Judge has seen and heard a Claimant give
      evidence. Thus, I find that the first-tier Tribunal gave adequate
      reasons which must be assessed in the light of the Secretary of
      State's case as it was put to her at the hearing. I find that her
      reasoning was adequate as it dealt with the matters in issue between
      the parties in respect of which clear reasons were given.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain a material error  of
law and I do not set it aside.

I dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal.

No application for anonymity was made and no  direction  is  appropriate  in
this case.
