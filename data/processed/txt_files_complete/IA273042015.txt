                            DECISION AND REASONS


      1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on  25  December  1998.
         In December 2014 he applied for a residence card as confirmation of
         a right to reside in Britain, he having married  an  EEA  national.
         At that stage he had been in Britain as a student for some time.
      2. The Secretary of State considered it appropriate that  there  be  a
         visit to the house where the appellant and his  wife  were  living.
         They went there on 29 March 2015.  The house was owned by the uncle
         and aunt of the appellant who lived there with their two  children.
         The uncle and aunt gave them some information about  the  appellant
         and his wife but they were not able to open their bedroom which was
         locked.  The Secretary of State then decided that there should be a
         further visit to the appellant's home and that  took  place  on  14
         April.  The notes of the visit made by  two  Immigration  Officers,
         Berg and Beckham said that they had conducted what  they  described
         as a pastoral visit.  The appellant was out but his wife was  there
         and she gave the officers consent for them to enter the house.  She
         confirmed they had married in November  2014  and  had  been  in  a
         relationship since December 2013 and she showed  the  officers  the
         bedroom.  The officers considered  what  they  saw  there  and  the
         report stated that it appeared that they were  both  cohabiting  in
         "this  [sic]  premises".   The  Immigration  Officer,  Kevin   Berg
         completed the report by saying "I am of the opinion that  there  is
         no evidence to suggest the marriage is not genuine".
      3.  It  appears  that  the  Secretary  of  State,   presumably   after
         considering the report of the visit on 29 March 2015, decided  that
         further questions should be asked of this couple and these  led  to
         an interview which took place on 11  August  2015.   A  very  large
         number  of  questions  indeed  were  asked  of  the  appellant  and
         separately of his wife and the following day  a  decision  refusing
         the application was made.  Detailed reasons for  the  refusal  were
         set out in a fairly lengthy letter but it is fair to say that  very
         few discrepancies of note between what the appellant and  his  wife
         said were pointed out in the letter.  Indeed the most important one
         appears to be that the appellant's wife had spelt his name  with  a
         double "s" rather than a single "s" in his second name.  I have  to
         say that I cannot consider that that is  an  important  discrepancy
         given of course that she would be unlikely to have  seen  the  name
         in writing on many occasions and of course it is presumably  either
         Urdu or Punjabi name and therefore  the   way  it  is   written  in
         English was likely to vary.  In any event,  the  letter,  in  fact,
         showed what I would consider to be quite a large number of detailed
         questions where both the appellant and his wife gave  very  similar
         answers.
      4. However, the application, having  been  refused,  the  appeal  came
         before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Clarke on 12  January  this
         year.  Judge Clarke heard evidence from the appellant and his  wife
         and then dismissed the appeal.  The appeal comes before  me  as  an
         appeal against the decision of Judge Clarke.
      5. Judge Clarke set out at some length various  discrepancies  between
         what the appellant and his wife said both  at  interview  and  when
         questioned at the appeal but the reality is that looking  at  these
         questions overall the appellant and  his  wife  gave  very  similar
         questions particularly in relation to a holiday  that  the  sponsor
         had recently taken  with  a  friend,  where  they  had  met,  their
         marriage and so on.  The judge, who it must be  said  did  properly
         direct herself that the burden of proof lay on the respondent,  was
         concerned about one thing which was that although she had been made
         aware of the pastoral visit which had taken place on 14 April  that
         report was not before her.  She gave a direction that  that  report
         be produced.  It was not.  She went on to dismiss the appeal.
      6. I have seen the report and the reality is that it was an  important
         document which the respondent should have placed before the  judge.
         That was clearly the duty of the respondent.  I consider that it is
         a document which had it properly been before the judge  could  well
         have changed her decision.  I consider that the judge did not  take
         into account all the evidence  that  was  in  existence  and  which
         should properly have been considered in the decision and that  that
         is a material error of law.  I would emphasise that this is  not  a
         case where it was the appellant's responsibility  to  produce  this
         document, it was  clearly  a  document  belonging  to  and  in  the
         possession of the respondent.  The burden lay on her to produce it.
         I therefore set aside the decision of the First-tier Judge.
      7. Having set the decision  of  the  First-tier  Judge  aside  I  have
         considered the evidence, which includes the report  by  Immigration
         Officer Berg, and applying the appropriate test as set out  in  the
         determination of the Tribunal in Papajorgji (EEA spouse -  marriage
         of convenience) Greece [2012] UKUT (IAC)  00038  I  find  that  the
         burden of proof which lay upon the respondent to show that this was
         a marriage of convenience  has  not  been  discharged.   Indeed,  I
         consider that  the  evidence,  given  the  very  large  numbers  of
         questions where the appellant and his wife reached or gave the same
         or similar  answers  together  with  the  report  from  Immigration
         Officer Berg makes it  clear  that  this  was  not  a  marriage  of
         convenience.  Accordingly, having set aside the decision  of  Judge
         of the First-tier Tribunal Clarke I remake the decision  and  allow
         this appeal.
