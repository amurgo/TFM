Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant, a  national  of  Vietnam,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision made by the Respondent on 16th January 2015
    to refuse to grant him asylum and/or humanitarian protection in the UK.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge C A S  O'Garro  dismissed  the  appeal  in  a
    decision promulgated on 26th January 2015.  The Appellant  now  appeals
    to this Tribunal  with  permission  granted  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Rintoul on 4th September 2018.  Permission to appeal was granted on the
    basis that it is arguable that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  erred  in
    concluding that, in the light of Paposhvili v Belgium [2017] Imm AR 867
    that removing the Appellant, who is on kidney dialysis, would not be in
    breach of Articles 3 and/or Article 8 of  the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights.

 3. The application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal contends
    that the judge erred in her assessment of Articles 3 and 8.

 4. The judge sets out the issue at paragraph 26 of the decision where  she
    said that what is in dispute is whether the Appellant can return to his
    country  and  access  treatment  for   his   medical   condition.   The
    Respondent's position before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  that  the
    Appellant could receive treatment  in  Vietnam  whereas  the  Appellant
    asserted that he could not.  The judge looked  at  what  treatment  was
    available in Vietnam and considered the background evidence relying  on
    an extract from the Country of Origin Information Service Report (COIR)
    at paragraphs 30-31 of the decision highlighting that the Report states
    that Vietnam had developed a simple device for a Continuous  Ambulatory
    Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) which only requires  a  plastic  bag  and  a
    catheter and can be used in  any  clean,  well-lit  place.   The  judge
    concluded that, although hospitals in  Vietnam  have  limited  dialysis
    machines to treat the thousands of citizens who  require  treatment,  a
    person who has renal failure and cannot get hooked  up  to  a  dialysis
    machine in a hospital can make use of the CAPD as an alternative.   The
    judge also went on to find at paragraph 32 that the objective  evidence
    shows that there is a health insurance programme which would  help  the
    Appellant to access private healthcare.  The judge found  that  medical
    facilities are available and that the Appellant's circumstances do  not
    reach the high threshold required for there to be a breach  of  Article
    3.

 5. At the hearing before me Miss  Record  submitted  that  it  is  not  in
    dispute that the Appellant has end-stage kidney disease.  She submitted
    that medical evidence before the Tribunal was that,  if  the  Appellant
    could not access dialysis in Vietnam, he would die

 6. Miss Record criticised the judge's approach  to  the  COIR  relying  on
    paragraph 38 of AM Zimbabwe [2018]  EWCA  Civ  64  which  analyses  the
    decision in Paposhvili.  In her submission the focus  of  the  European
    Court of Human Rights is not now confined to deathbed cases but applies
    in circumstances where

         "Substantial grounds  have  been  shown  for  believing  that  [the
         Appellant], although not at imminent risk of dying,  would  face  a
         real risk, on account of the absence of  appropriate  treatment  in
         the receiving country or lack of access to such treatment, of being
         exposed to a serious, rapid and irreversible decline in his or  her
         state of health resulting in intense suffering or to a  significant
         reduction in life expectancy" (paragraph 183 of Paposhvili).

 7. Miss Record relied on the medical evidence which was before the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge.  She relied on the letter from  Barts  Health  NHS
    Trust following the  Appellant's  attendance  at  the  clinic  on  24th
    January 2017 where the consultant nephrologist stated "I am writing  to
    confirm that this patient requires haemodialysis therapy, three times a
    week, at Whipps Cross Hospital.  This is a  life  sustaining  and  life
    saving treatment without which he is unable to survive."

 8. She referred  also  to  a  further  letter  from  the  same  consultant
    following a clinic on  27th June  2017  where  the  consultant  stated



         "I am the dialysis consultant for the above patient.  He  has  end-
         stage  kidney  disease  with  no  chance  of  his  native   kidneys
         recovering.  He has haemodialysis treatment three times a  week  at
         Whipps Cross Hospital on patient's ward.  Recently his urine output
         has reduced which indicates that he is now even more dependent than
         previously on haemodialysis. Specifically should his  haemodialysis
         treatment be interrupted or suspended for any reason  he  is  at  a
         very high risk of death explicitly if he moves to or  lives  in  an
         environment where haemodialysis is not readily  available  then  he
         would die".

 9. Miss Record submitted that the point is whether or not, within days  of
    getting to Vietnam, the Appellant could access treatment.   She  relied
    on the skeleton argument which was before the First-tier Tribunal where
    it stated at paragraph 5 that the Appellant would most  likely  die  if
    his treatment is interrupted or stopped.   She  pointed  out  that  the
    skeleton argument raised the issue that the Home Office did not  appear
    to have put in place any travel arrangements which would guarantee  the
    Appellant's health during  that  arrangement  and  on  his  arrival  in
    Vietnam.  In her submission the  Secretary  of  State's  duty  of  care
    applied to the Appellant as they  would  be  removing  him  to  another
    country and the duty of care would be to  have  in  place  a  framework
    where  his  condition  would  not  be  exacerbated  or  his   treatment
    interrupted.

10. She referred to paragraph 41 of Paposhvili, pointing out that  even  on
    the extreme facts of the Paposhvili case the Grand Chamber  was  unable
    to say that it was clear that a  violation  of  Article  8  would  have
    occurred but that there was a procedural obligation to examine the case
    with care and with  reference  to  all  the  available  evidence.   She
    submitted that that had not happened in this case.

11. Miss Record addressed the decision in EA and Others (Article 3  medical
    cases - Paposhvili not applicable) [2017] UKUT 00445 (IAC) and in  her
    submission there is a procedural obligation in issue in this  case  and
    the issue is whether the Appellant would be  treated  appropriately  in
    Vietnam and she accepted that there was  no  authority  going  to  that
    point.

12. Ms Isherwood submitted that there was no material error in  this  case.
    The Appellant's case in her submission had been put  forward  as  being
    one where he  could  not  afford  the  treatment  in  Vietnam  but  the
    background evidence shows that there is  treatment  available  and  the
    evidence before the judge was that the Appellant's younger brother  had
    raised funds to fund a visa application for him to come to the UK as  a
    kidney donor.  Therefore it was likely that the family had  some  money
    and this is a factor taken into account by the judge at  paragraph  35.
    In her submission the decision in AM (Zimbabwe)  indicates  clearly  at
    paragraph 7 that the burden of proof is on the Appellant to  show  that
    there would be a significant risk of deterioration in  his  health  and
    possible death in Zimbabwe.

13. She referred to paragraph 39 which highlights elements of the  decision
    in Paposhvili and paragraph  40.   Her  submission  was  that  even  in
    Paposhvili no breach was found.  In her submission the Appellant  bears
    the burden of proof and the judge in this case properly considered  the
    Appellant's evidence.  So at paragraphs 4 and 5 the judge set  out  the
    Appellant's condition and noted  at  paragraph  5  that  the  Appellant
    claimed that he could not return to Vietnam as the cost of dialysis and
    the transplant is very expensive.  She highlighted paragraph  22  where
    again the Appellant's claim is stated that he cannot return to  Vietnam
    because he will die as he will not receive  the  medical  treatment  he
    needs for his medical condition.

14. Ms Isherwood submitted that the judge accepted the medical condition at
    paragraph 26 and highlighted the issue in dispute at paragraph 27.  The
    judge considered the  background  evidence  at  paragraphs  30  and  31
    acknowledging  the  high  threshold  required  at  paragraph  32.   She
    highlighted at paragraph 35  the  judge  took  into  account  that  the
    Appellant has a younger brother who agreed to be a donor  and  who  had
    applied to come to the  UK  as  a  kidney  donor  and  found  that  the
    Appellant had provided no credible explanation why  that  money  is  no
    longer available to assist him with the private treatment  in  Vietnam.
    Just as the family were able to raise that money  when  it  was  deemed
    necessary for the Appellant's brother to come to the UK as a  donor  in
    the judge's finding the family can similarly raise similar funds to pay
    for the Appellant's medical treatment in Vietnam if that  is  the  only
    way he can receive medical treatment.

15. In her submission the judge had evidence on which to base the  findings
    made.  She further submitted that in terms of the mechanics of  removal
    the Secretary of State would put in place appropriate arrangements  for
    the Appellant's removal.

16. In response Miss Record referred to paragraph 40 of the decision in  AM
    (Zimbabwe) which highlighted that Article 3 would be breached if it was
    established that there would be a serious and rapid decline  in  health
    resulting in intense suffering to the Article 3 standard where death is
    not expected.  She submitted that the evidence before the judge  showed
    that even if treatment was interrupted the Appellant would be  at  risk
    of death.  She submitted that  paragraph  44  of  AM  (Zimbabwe)  which
    relates to the Appellant in that case had HIV  but  not  AIDS  and  she
    submitted that this highlights a difference between that case and this.



Error of Law

17. I have taken into account the submissions put forward by  both  parties
    and the case law.

18. In AM (Zimbabwe) the Court of Appeal  concluded  that  whilst  N  v  UK
    Application 26565/05 was binding authority up to Supreme  Court  level,
    Paposhvili relaxed the test only to a very modest extent. The  boundary
    had simply shifted from being defined by  imminence  of  death  in  the
    removing  state  even  with  treatment  to  the  imminence  of  intense
    suffering or death in the receiving state occurring because of the lack
    of treatment previously available in the removing state.  At  paragraph
    38 of AM (Zimbabwe) Sales LJ said:

         "In other words the boundary  of  Article  3  protection  has  been
         shifted from being defined by imminence of death  in  the  removing
         state (even with the treatment available there) to being defined by
         the imminence (i.e. likely rapid experience) of  intense  suffering
         or death in the receiving state, which may only  occur  because  of
         the non-availability in that  state  of  the  treatment  which  had
         previously been available in the removing state".

19. In this case the judge accepted that the Appellant has end-stage kidney
    disease, that he receives dialysis three times a week and that he  will
    need to continue receiving dialysis three times a  week  unless  he  is
    able to have a kidney transplant [26].  The judge identified  that  the
    issue in dispute is whether the Appellant can return to his country and
    access treatment for his medical condition.  It is clear that the judge
    considered the background  evidence  at  paragraphs  30  and  31.   His
    analysis  of  that  background  evidence  has  not  been  significantly
    disputed.  The judge also considered the objective evidence showed that
    there is a health insurance programme.   The  judge  also  found  that,
    based on the fact that the Appellant's family previously raised  �8,300
    for his younger brother to come  to  the  UK,  there  was  no  credible
    evidence why this money was no longer available and no evidence  as  to
    why they could not raise similar  funds  to  pay  for  the  Appellant's
    medical treatment in Vietnam.

20. On the basis of these findings it was open to the judge  to  find  that
    there are medical facilities available for  the  Appellant  to  receive
    treatment in Vietnam.

21. In the circumstances it was open to the judge to  find  that  the  high
    threshold required to show a breach of Article 3 had not been met.

Notice of Decision

22. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does  not  contain  a  material
