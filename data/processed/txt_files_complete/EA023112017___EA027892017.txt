Representation:

For the Appellants:    In Person
For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants have been granted permission to appeal the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Pacey dismissing their  appeals  against  the
    decision of the respondent to refuse their  application  for  leave  to
    remain  under  the  EEA   Regulations.    The   respondent   considered
    Regulations 19(1), 15(1) and 6(1) of the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations
    2006.  Whilst it was acknowledged that the  first  appellant  had  been
    employed since 4 April 2014, the respondent said that she had failed to
    provide sufficient evidence that she had been exercising treaty  rights
    for five continuous years.

2.   The respondent considered the second  appellant's  application  in  its
    own right as a qualified person.  The respondent acknowledged that  the
    second appellant has been attending primary school since  12  September
    2011.  However, the respondent said in order to qualify as  a  student,
    it was essential that evidence of comprehensive  medical  insurance  is
    provided, with reference to 6(1).  As he had  failed  to  provide  such
    evidence, he did not qualify for permanent residence in his own right.

3.   The appellants are a mother and a minor son and both  are  citizens  of
    Spain.  The first appellant was born on 23 September 1988.  The  second
    appellant was born on 6 March 2007.

4.   On 17  December  2016  the  first  appellant  applied  for  a  document
    certifying permanent residence as a confirmation of a right  to  reside
    in the United Kingdom.  It was acknowledged by the respondent that  the
    first appellant was currently employed and had been since 7 April  2014
    with employer Pret A Manger.  However, it was said that she  failed  to
    provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that she has been exercising
    treaty rights for five continuous years.  No evidence provided prior to
    2014 exhibited that she had been residing in the UK in accordance  with
    the  Regulations.   Her  application  was   therefore   refused   under
    Regulation 15(1)(a) and 6(1) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.

5.   With reference to the second appellant's  application,  the  respondent
    said he had applied as an EEA  national  family  member  of  the  first
    appellant.   Because  the  first  appellant  had  failed   to   provide
    sufficient evidence of employment over  a  continuous  period  of  five
    years in accordance with the  Regulations,  the  respondent  could  not
    issue a document certifying permanent residence when relying  upon  his
    sponsor.

6.   It was upon this basis that the respondent decided to consider  him  in
    his own right as a qualified person and acknowledged that he  had  been
    attending primary school since 12 September 2011 and therefore in order
    to qualify as a student it was essential that evidence of comprehensive
    medical insurance is provided, with reference to Regulation  6(1).   As
    there was no such evidence the respondent found that he did not qualify
    for permanent residence in his own right.

7.   The judge at paragraph 10 listed  the  documentary  evidence  that  was
    before her.  These were HMRC tax credits, P60s and an  HMRC  concerning
    jobseeker's allowance stating the benefit ceased on 16 July 2013 and  a
    letter referring to JSA being paid from 29 May 2013.  The  judge  noted
    that an earlier letter was dated 30 October 2012.

8.   At paragraph 11 the judge said that a payslip from G  S  recorded  that
    her pay in the year to date had  been  �8814.64.   Her  gross  pay  for
    January 2012 was �833.  The judge found it  was  reasonable  to  deduce
    that the first appellant must have been employed from April 2011.   The
    conclusion was fortified by the fact that her P60 for that year  showed
    total earnings in the year of �11,091.04.

9.   The judge also noted at paragraph 15  that  there  was  a  letter  from
    MITIE dated 11 February 2010 confirmed that the first  appellant  began
    working for them on 1 February 2010.

10.  The judge said at paragraph 16 that accepting from  all  the  documents
    before her, which came from various independent and unconnected  public
    bodies (the local council, HMRC  and  Guy's  Hospital)  and  her  bank,
    together with her payslips, that the appellants have  been  in  the  UK
    since at least February 2010.  She made her current application  on  17
    December 2016.  The judge therefore found  that  at  the  date  of  her
    application and hence the date of decision,  the  first  appellant  had
    been in the UK for five years, as a qualified person.

11.  Ms Holmes did not dispute this decision.   Indeed,  she  accepted  that
    even though the respondent did not accept that the first appellant  was
    a qualified person as a  worker,  it  was  in  the  light  of  evidence
    surrounding  her  employment  that  the  judge  found  that  the  first
    appellant was a qualified person.

12.  In the light of the judge's finding that  the  first  appellant  was  a
    qualified person under the EEA Regulations, I find that  there  was  no
    requirement for the second appellant, the minor child  of  his  mother,
    the first appellant to provide  evidence  of  comprehensive  insurance.
    Consequently, I find that the judge erred in  law  that  he  needed  to
    provide such evidence.

13.  The judge relied on two cases to find that the  second  appellant  must
    be covered by comprehensive sickness insurance. I was unable to  locate
    these cases in the law reports.

14.  In the light of the judge's findings, I find that the judge's  decision
    cannot stand.

15.   I set it aside and remake it.

16.   For the reasons  given  above,  the  appeals  of  the  appellants  are
    allowed.



No anonymity direction is made.
