Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Jesurum of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellants our citizens of Nepal born on this 16 May 1987  and  19
      December 1988 respectively. They appealed against the decisions of the
      respondent dated 23 September 2015  to  refuse  to  grant  them  entry
      clearance as the adult dependent son and  daughter  of  their  parents
      present and settled in the United Kingdom under the Gurkha Policy  set
      out in Annex K of IDI Chapter 15.




   2. The appellants appeal was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Mace
      following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 11 May 2017.  Leave  to  appeal
      was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Ford,  stating  that  it  was
      arguable that the Tribunal erred in its consideration of Article 8, in
      particular when finding that Article 8 was not engaged in  respect  of
      family life.



    First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision




   3. The Judge acknowledged that the grounds of appeal rely only on  family
      life of the appellant's pursuer to Article 8 because it  was  accepted
      that the provisions of Annex K are not  met  by  the  appellants.  The
      Judge's first consideration was whether  there  are  sufficient  links
      exists between the appellants and their sponsor to give  rise  to  the
      protection of Article 8.




   4. The Judge considered the guidance in  the  case  of  Kugathas  v  SSHD
      [2003] EWCA Civ  31,  that  relationships  between  adults  would  not
      necessarily require the protection of Article 8  without  evidence  of
      further  elements  of  dependency,  involving  more  than  the  normal
      emotional ties. The Judge understood that dependency is not limited to
      economic dependency and that family life may continue between a parent
      and child even after the child has attained his or her majority.




   5. The Judge stated that the witness statements of both appellants are in
      identical terms. The appellant's both state that before their  parents
      went to live in the United Kingdom they were living as a  family  unit
      in Nepal. The Judge stated that the appellants and  the  sponsor  have
      been in regular contact and share a very special bond with each other.
      The judge noted that the sponsor, Mr Rai gave  evidence  that  he  has
      returned to Nepal  twice  in  October  2013  until  January  2014  and
      February 27 of March 2017 for a month and his wife  has  also  visited
      Nepal three times. In respect of financial support,  the  Judge  noted
      there are money transfer remittances covering the period  of  2011  to
      November 2016. The amounts vary but  are  generally  around  �300  but
      there are also some significantly larger transfers in amounts of �1500-
       �3,000.



   6. The Judge noted that the first appellant in his statement had  a  work
      permit for Malaysia and claims that he did  not  travel  and  work  in
      Malaysia. The first appellant's explanation is that  his  parents  did
      not let him go to Malaysia as they heard that many Nepalese  labourers
      are being exploited in Malaysia without payment. Also, he did not want
      to leave his sister alone in Nepal.



   7. The Judge noted that the first appellant  asserted  in  her  statement
      that she has only completed her +12 exams and was unable  to  continue
      her education due to their financial condition. However, he stated,  a
      higher secondary education board certificate was produced indicating a
      pass  in  a  number  of  subjects  including  accountancy,  economics,
      business studies and  marketing  which  demonstrates  later  education
      which was not indicated by the sponsor.



   8. The Judge stated that he accepts that there are genuine ties  of  love
      and affection between the appellants and their parent's. However,  the
      Judge stated that when considering the evidence of emotional ties,  he
      notes firstly that the statements of the  two  appellants  are  almost
      completely identical in  their  content.  The  statements  talk  about
      conversations that they have had with  their  parents  as  to  whether
      their father is taking his medication are exactly the same. He  stated
      that this is the type of enquiry that any adult child might make of an
      elderly parent. There is no  personal  detail  as  to  the  particular
      issues with which the sponsors have given  emotional  support  to  the
      appellants.



   9. The Judge concluded by stating that the evidence does not  demonstrate
      dependence over and above that which any other close adults  may  have
      with their parents. The appellants are single and  do  not  live  with
      their parents and have not done so for a considerable length of  time.
      In conclusion, the Judge stated that while he accepts  that  there  is
      genuine love and affection between the appellants  and  the  sponsors,
      the right to a family life is not engaged. The Judge stated  that  the
      proportionality  of  the  decision  is  not  therefore  an  issue.  He
      dismissed the appellants appeals




    The grounds of appeal




  10. The grounds of appeal are extremely lengthy and in summary states that
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge in  finding  that  family  life  is  not
      engaged at all under Article 8 (1) has materially erred  in  law.  The
      Judge failed to appreciate that this is a case under the Gurkha policy
      and his consideration of Article 8 does not indicate that he took this
      into account when assessing whether family  life  exists  between  the
      appellants and their sponsors in the United Kingdom. The Judge  failed
      to appreciate that due to the historic injustice, once family life  is
      confirmed to exist for the purposes of article 8 (1), the Judge should
      have gone on to consider the correction of historic  injustice  within
      the proportionality assessment. It would appear that  the  Judge  fell
      into the same errors as the Upper Tribunal in the case of Rai v  entry
      clearance officer (New Delhi) EWCA Civ 320 [2017] handed  down  on  28
      April 2017. The grounds of appeal also refer to jurisprudence  on  the
      issue of adult children under the Gurkha policy.




    Rule 24 response




  11. The respondent in her  Rule  24  response  stated  the  following,  in
      summary. The respondent opposes the  appellant's  appeal  and  submits
      that the Judge directed himself appropriately. The grounds  of  appeal
      challenged the Judge's finding that he was not satisfied  that  family
      life  existed  between  the  appellants  and  the  sponsors.  This  is
      inevitably a fact sensitive assessment  and  the  determination  shows
      that the Judge carefully considered the evidence. He  noted  the  very
      similar statements of the appellants and their lack  of  detail,  this
      inevitably  informed  his  assessment  of  family  life.  The  Judge's
      conclusions are fully reasoned and founded  on  the  weakness  of  the
      evidence.




    The hearing



  12. At the hearing, I heard erudite submissions from  both  parties  which
      were of great assistance.

Discussion and decision as to whether there is an error of law

13. I have considered the first-tier Tribunal Judge's decision with care as
    I have considered the submissions made by the parties.  Permission  was
    granted only in respect of the Judge's lack  of  consideration  of  the
    appellants right to a family life  under  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights. There is no dispute that the appellants did
    not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.


  14. In respect of his consideration of his Article 8, the Judge found that
      there was no family life worthy of protection under Article 8  between
      the sponsors and  the  appellants  after  having  considered  all  the
      evidence.


  15. The evidence before the Judge was  of  financial  remittances  to  the
      appellants in Nepal. The Judge  accepted  that  the  sponsors  in  the
      United Kingdom send the appellants  money.  The  Judge  accepted  that
      there was contact between them. The  Judge  accepted  that  there  are
      genuine ties of love and affection between the  appellants  and  their
      sponsors.


  16. The Judge however placed  undue  reliance  on  the  identical  witness
      statements of the appellants to find that  there  is  no  family  life
      between the appellants and their sponsors. The Judge stated  that  the
      contents of conversations with their father in their  statements  were
      exactly the same such as enquiring about  their  father's  health  and
      whether he is taking his medication. He found that this is the type of
      enquiry that any adult child might make of his elderly parent  and  as
      such there was no personal detail as to  the  particular  issues  with
      which the sponsors have given emotional support to the appellants.


  17. It is clear from this finding  that  the  Judge  only  considered  the
      appellants family life with  their  parents  and  not  the  other  way
      around. It is incumbent on the decision maker to consider  the  family
      life of all members of the family who  enjoy  family  life  with  each
      other. The appellant sponsor is a Gurkha soldier who was  entitled  to
      settle in this country and it  follows  that  they  are  also  equally
      entitled to continue their family life with those they were forced  to
      leave behind.  The  Judge  did  not  consider  the  family  bonds  and
      emotional dependency of the sponsors with their adult  children  which
      led him into a material error.


  18. The Judge also did not  consider  the  cultural  implications  of  the
      appellants and their sponsors when  determining  whether  family  life
      exists between them.  The  Judge  correctly  relied  on  the  case  of
      Kugathas but failed to appreciate that this was an  appeal  under  the
      Gurkha policy where the historical injustice needs to be addressed.


  19. The Judge has also confused evidence which goes to proportionality and
      evidence which goes to  whether  there  is  an  existing  family  life
      between the appellants and their  sponsors.  Under  Article  8(1)  the
      appellants must demonstrate that they had a  family  life  with  their
      parents, which had existed at the time of their departure to settle in
      the United Kingdom and had endured  beyond  it,  notwithstanding  them
      having left Nepal when they did.


  20. It might be that when the proportionality exercise is  property  done,
      the appellants may not succeed but to find there  is  no  family  life
      between the appellants and their sponsors is not a conclusion that was
      available to the Judge on the evidence and  given  that  this  was  an
      appeal  by  adult  children  of  a  former  Gurkha   soldier.   Proper
      consideration was not given to the  case  of  Rai  v  entry  clearance
      officer (New Delhi) EWCA Civ 320 [2017].

21. There is a material error of law in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge in respect of Article 8 of the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights and I set it aside. The appeal be placed before  an  Upper
    Tribunal Judge on the first available date, for the appeal  to  be  re-
    heard based only on the submissions of the parties.

    Hearing on 10 November 2017

22. At the hearing, Mr Jesurum and the  senior  presenting  officer  agreed
    that since new evidence was going to be produced, the appeals  be  sent
    back to the First-tier Tribunal for a hearing de novo for  findings  of
    fact to be made. I direct that the appeal be placed  before  any  other
    First-tier Tribunal Judge other than Judge Mace on the first  available
    date.


Signed by                           Dated this 26th day of November 2017
