                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.     This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Ian Freer), sitting at Taylor House on 19 May,  to   an
    asylum and human rights  appeal by a citizen of  Iran,  whose  date  of
    birth is conventionally recorded  as  1  January  1998.  Permission  to
    appeal was given on  the  judge's  treatment  of  internal  relocation,
    including  the  appellant's  prospects  if  conscripted  for   military
    service: other points may be relevant to those issues.

 2. The appellant had given a history of his  father  having  been  a  drug
    smuggler across the Iraqi border: in [ ] 2015 he had been killed in  an
    incident there, and fellow-smugglers had come to the appellant, as  his
    eldest son, to try and persuade him to take over the  family  business,
    which  he  was  unwilling  to  do.  The   appellant   was   afraid   of
    repercussions, so arranged with the help of his uncle  to  leave  Iran,
    and  on  21  July  arrived  in  the  back  of   a   lorry   in   Corby,
    Northamptonshire. He  claimed  asylum  three  days  later,  but  on  27
    November it was refused. The first decision dismissing his  appeal  was
    set aside on 29 December 2016, and a fresh hearing directed.

FIRST-TIER DECISION

 3. Judge Freer, in general terms, accepted the appellant's evidence on the
    primary facts about which he knew; but, for reasons he gave,  took  the
    view that it did not raise a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution.  The
    appellant's first ground of  appeal  turned  on  his  approach  to  the
    relevant country guidance, in SB (risk on return-illegal exit) Iran  CG
    [2009] UKAIT 00053. The judge discussed the circumstances in which  the
    appellant left Iran at paragraphs 51 - 52, and went on at 53  -  54  to
    summarize the effect of SB  in these terms:

         "... Iranians facing enforced return do not in general face a  real
         risk of persecution or ill-treatment. That remains the case even if
         they exited Iran illegally. The illegal exit is not  a  significant
         risk factor. The heightened risk relates to the political  profile,
         in those cases which have any. I find this case is  wholly  lacking
         in any political profile.

         Much is made of  the  risk  to  those  leaving  when  facing  Court
         proceedings. [The appellant] did not leave at a time  when  he  was
         facing Court proceedings. There is no known arrest warrant."

 4. This seems to me a fair summary of  the judicial head-note  in  SB   at
    this point:

        iii) Being a person who has left Iran when facing court proceedings
             (other than ordinary civil  proceedings)  is  a  risk  factor,
             although much will depend on the particular facts relating  to
             the nature of the offence(s) involved and other circumstances.
             The more the offences for  which  a  person  faces  trial  are
             likely to be viewed as political, the  greater  the  level  of
             risk likely to arise as  a  result.  ...,  being  involved  in
             ongoing court proceedings is not  in  itself   something  that
             will automatically  result  in  ill-treatment;  rather  it  is
             properly to be considered as a risk factor to  be  taken  into
             account along with others.
         iv) (Being a person involved in court  proceedings  in  Iran  ...)
             cannot apply in this case, so that the applicability of
          v)  (Being  accused  of  anti-Islamic   conduct   likewise   also
             constitutes a  significant  risk  factor)  is  the  only  open
             question on that part of the country guidance.

 5. The judge went on to refer to SSH and HR (illegal exit:  failed  asylum
    seeker Iran (CG) [2016] UKUT 308 (IAC), citing  paragraph  (b)  of  the
    judicial head-note:

         "An Iranian male  in  respect  of  whom  no  adverse  interest  has
         previously been manifested by the Iranian State  does  not  face  a
         real risk of persecution/breach of his Article 3 rights  on  return
         to Iran on account of having left Iran  illegally  and/or  being  a
         failed  asylum  seeker.  No  such  risk  exists  at  the  time   of
         questioning on return to Iran nor after the facts (i.e. of  illegal
         exit and being a failed asylum seeker) have  been  established.  In
         particular, there is not a real  risk  of  prosecution  leading  to
         imprisonment."

 6. Miss Caseley's argument on ground 1  was  that,  since  the  judge  had
    accepted (at paragraph 51) that the appellant had left  illegally,  and
    (45) that "Drug crime is an important political issue"  [in  Iran],  he
    fell within paragraph (iii) of the  country  guidance  above.  However,
    that would depend on whether he left facing court  proceedings,  which,
    if any had been thought of, had not even got so far  as  a  warrant  of
    arrest. Since the police have not pursued them with his mother  (see  7
    (c) below), there is nothing  in  the  point  at  paragraph  8  of  the
    grounds. Nor is there any basis for allowing the appeal on paragraph 9:
    the judge's comments at paragraph 43 represent his declining to  accept
    all the presenting officer's submissions; but  there  was  in  fact  no
    evidence of any warrant of arrest being issued against the appellant.

 7. Turning to ground 2, paragraph 12 of the grounds criticizes  the  judge
    for a number of what are said to be  unwarranted  assumptions:  I  will
    deal with them in order.

      a) is about the judge's findings at paragraph  63  as  to  the  police
         having had "... access to every adult concerned",  that  is,  under
         any suspicion of being involving in the appellant's  father's  drug
         dealings. I do  not  see  anything  unreasonable  about  this:  the
         appellant was 17 when he left Iran after the death of  his  father,
         over two years before the date of the first-tier hearing, and,  one
         way or another, it was legitimate for the judge to proceed  on  the
         basis that the police would by now have exhausted their  inquiries.
         Returning for the moment to paragraphs 10 and 11 (and see also 13),
         whatever the judge said about the likely results of prosecution, if
         it happened, he was entitled not to accept that it  was  reasonably
         likely to do so.

      b) The only point here which might in theory leave a doubt on  (c)  is
         about the smugglers telling the appellant (see paragraph 23 of  his
         statement) that they had themselves pointed the finger  at  him  to
         the police; but, since that casting of suspicion had  preceded  the
         police's second visit, and there was no evidence  that  this  visit
         had been succeeded by others, the point made at (c) remains valid.

      c) This is about the judge's  conclusion  at  70  that  any  remaining
         inquiries would lead to no risk for the appellant. It is criticized
         as not borne out by the judicial head-note in SSH and HR, to  which
         the judge referred, on the  basis  of  the  police  visits  to  the
         appellant's house, accepted by the  judge  at  42  -  43,  and  the
         appellant's own statement, paragraphs 21 - 23, about  their  having
         shown  suspicions  that  he  himself  was  involved  in  the  drugs
         business. However, the appellant's own evidence was that, on  their
         second visit, the police had thoroughly searched his family  house,
         found nothing, and left. While  he  had  further  visits  from  the
         smugglers before he left Iran, there were none from the police; and
         that was also the  position  when  he  spoke  to  his  mother  from
         Istanbul (see 30).

 8. As for paragraph 14, while the judge's statistical approach to the risk
    of execution generally in Iran was perhaps misplaced, he did not accept
    that this appellant would face prosecution, on a capital charge  or  at
    all, and so there was no basis for any such risk in this case.

 9. Ground 3 refers to the judge's conclusions on internal relocation: Miss
    Caseley's first point was to ask, rhetorically, how the appellant would
    get to Teheran to seek safety there? That has to refer to  difficulties
    he might face on arrival at the city's airport, to where  he  would  be
    returned; but see my conclusions on ground 1 for my views on this.





10. Next the judge is  criticized  for  rejecting  (at  paragraph  72)  the
    'country expert's  opinion  on  the  appellant's  potential  safety  in
    Teheran, without giving reasons for that. However, the main reason  why
    Dr Kashefi had said he would not be safe there was something the  judge
    did deal with, at paragraph 66. I will deal with this and other  points
    on internal relocation if I find I need to, after  considering  all  of
    the applicant's case on risk on  return,  not  only  at  the  point  of
    return, but in his home area.

11. I have already dealt with the first under ground 1,  and  much  of  the
    second under ground 2; but there remains ground 4. This criticizes  the
    judge's approach to the issue  of  whether  the  appellant  would  have
    sufficient protection in his home area. It is suggested that  there  is
    an internal contradiction between his findings at paragraph 50, to  the
    effect that drug gangs had penetrated law enforcement agencies  to  the
    extent that the appellant could not safely approach any individual  law
    enforcement officer for help; and at paragraph 74, where he says this:

         "It is strongly doubted that most police, or even many,  are  under
         the influence of this gang. It is doubted that the gang  will  know
         to look for him in Tehran or wherever he is conscripted  to  It  is
         doubted that they will know to check if he has re-entered Iran.  He
         can relocate away from them and earn good money independently."

12. The judge was perfectly entitled to find that a drug gang operating  on
    the mountainous border with Iraq  would  not  be  alert  to  trace  the
    appellant on return to the capital (population around  8.8  million  in
    the city and 15 million in its larger  metropolitan  area,  account  to
    Wikipedia) or its airport, both several hundred  miles  away.  I  shall
    return to what is said to be the risk he would  face  on  conscription.
    There remain also the general points made under ground 3 about internal
    relocation to Teheran, and I shall deal with all  these  in  the  order
    they are made.

13.  First,  while  the  judge  acknowledged  at  71  the  availability  of
    nationwide intelligence to the police, he  made  no  finding  that  the
    drugs gang would have similar resources, and, in view of what  he  said
    at 74, set out at 10, it is quite clear that he did not accept this. So
    far as police intelligence is concerned, no doubt they would have  some
    means of tracing anyone in whom they were seriously interested; but, as
    to that, see the judge's findings dealt with above under ground 2.

14. Second, the judge is criticized for going on, at 71 - 72, to say this

         "[The appellant] cannot relocate, suggests the expert,  because  he
         would need contacts and money. State support is  very  limited  for
         unwaged or unemployed young men. He would have only poor access  to
         education, healthcare, housing and job opportunities.

         I find that I reject the expert view on this issue. He can relocate
         to Tehran which  is  a  modern  bustling  city  with  numerous  job
         opportunities open to him."

15. Though the judge gives no reference for the evidence cited, it is taken
    verbatim from paragraph 40 of Dr Kashefi's report. While it is entirely
    possible that the judge was right in his  assessment  of  the  economic
    situation in Teheran (following the well-known recent upturn  resulting
    from the partial lifting of sanctions, with which Dr Kashefi  fails  to
    deal), he does not refer to any evidence contrary to her expressed view
    on this point. While it is by  no  means  a  foregone  conclusion  that
    accepting her  view  would  have  led  to  his  finding  that  internal
    relocation would not be available, I think the  question  needs  to  be
    argued, in terms of AH (Sudan) [2007] UKHL 49,  and any other  relevant
    authorities, preferably on the  basis  of  evidence  from  both  sides.
    Directions were given following the first hearing for a further one for
    that purpose.

16. The third point concerns the judge's finding at 33 that  the  appellant
    "... remains a vulnerable witness, by reason of his age.  There  is  no
    bright line drawn at 18 years". While that specific  finding  concerned
    only  his   position   as   a   witness,   the   appellant's   personal
    characteristics will of course be relevant on the question of  internal
    relocation; but they do not go further than his age, which will  be  20
    by the time I deal with that question.

17. The fourth and last point concerns Dr Kashefi's  "finding",  as  it  is
    dignified in the grounds, that (see her paragraph 38) "More than likely
    [the appellant] will be transferred to [areas nearer his home] to serve
    his conscription where he is likely to be identified  by  his  father's
    friends [ie the drugs gang]. In her original report  Dr  Kashefi  cited
    not a scrap of evidence for this conclusion, and it provided  no  basis
    whatsoever for any arguable error of law on the part of the judge.

18. The result of the 20 November hearing was  that  the  judge's  decision
    stood, except for his conclusions on internal  relocation  to  Teheran.
    Since  the  basis  for  that  exception  concerned  only  the   general
    availability of that option for a young man of  this  appellant's  age,
    there was no need for any further oral evidence; but for time  reasons,
    directions were given about a further hearing on 29 January.

FURTHER HEARING

19. Those directions provided that this hearing would be concerned with the
    points set out at paragraphs 14, 15 & 17 above only.  While  I  suspect
    that 17 was my mistake for 16, since that was the  third  paragraph  in
    which I dealt with internal relocation, by 29 January a further  report
    by Dr Kashefi had been filed, dealing with 17, and I said I  should  be
    prepared to consider it, together with  the  further  evidence  dealing
    with internal relocation.

20. On that basis, Miss Capel raised no objection to the late submission of
    further evidence by Mr Tufan. This consisted in

     a) the  Home  Office  Country  Policy  and  Information  Note  [CPIN],
        December 2017; and

     b) a Home Office web-page  on  their  voluntary  assisted  return  and
        reintegration programme [VARRP], down-loaded 26 January 2018

21. Military service As Miss Capel dealt with that evidence, from her point
    of view, in the course of her submissions, I shall go through  all  the
    evidence as she dealt with it, beginning with the material on  military
    service. The passage in which Dr Kashefi dealt with the point at 17  in
    her additional report (12 January) was at paragraphs 1.10 - 14. At 1.10
    she notes that there are ten  training  camps  for  conscripts  in  the
    appellant's north-eastern area of Iran; but the next posting  is  where
    they serve the rest of their  time.  Married  men  are  given  priority
    (1.11) for service in their home town, 'regardless of the unit'.

22. However (1.12) on 2 April 2016 the commander of the border  police  had
    said their main objective for the year just starting was to  deal  with
    smuggling: the best choice would be to deploy  soldiers  local  to  the
    region, and this  was  their  objective.  Other  officials  had  stated
    similar objectives before, and Dr Kashefi  thought  it  was  reasonably
    likely that this appellant would be deployed to the border  area  after
    basic training.

23. Further evidence is given at 1.13 - 14 about the actual  deployment  of
    conscripts to border areas, and reactions to it. On 5 January 2016  one
    was killed and three injured in an avalanche at a border  post  between
    the provinces of Kurdistan and Kermanshah. Since this was a  provincial
    border, rather than a state one, there is nothing on the face  of  this
    to show any existing practice of  deployment  of  local  conscripts  on
    international borders.

24. There had however already been another incident  on  the  Iran/Pakistan
    border on 12 November 2013, when 12 conscripts serving there  had  been
    kidnapped and murdered. An Iranian news web-site published  an  article
    "Why guard borders with inexperienced convicts?". Dr Kashefi says there
    had been repeated questions asked about this, but it was still "...  an
    ongoing and active policy".

25. There is further material  in  Dr  Kashefi's  additional  report  about
    exemptions from military  service,  both  educational,  to  which  this
    appellant would clearly not be entitled; and for family reasons, if  he
    showed he was the only provider  for  his  widowed  mother.  Since  his
    younger brother was only 14 when he left (so 16 now), there might  have
    been some chance of that; but there is no point speculating  about  it,
    since the judge chose (see 59) to accept the appellant's evidence  that
    he had lost all means of getting in touch  with  his  mother  with  his
    mobile phone in Turkey.

26. Dr Kashefi referred to the relevant Iranian legislation by its  English
    acronym 'CC' at 1.27. Article 58 required the armed forces actively  to
    look for missing conscripts and other government agencies were required
    to co-operate with them. Nevertheless she acknowledged (1.29) that "...
    draft evasion is a fact and many go missing". An  MP  had  mentioned  a
    figure of 40% in poorer areas.

27. The only open question on military service, on the  grounds  for  which
    permission was given, is whether  the  appellant  would  be  reasonably
    likely to be called up on return to serve in the border  force  in  his
    home area. Dr Kashefi's conclusion on this has already been referred to
    at 24, and appears in full at 3.2:

         'As explained in paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 above, if he  does  serve
         there is every possibility that he  will  be  placed  in  his  home
         province and as explained likely  that  he  would  be  deployed  at
         border crossings. This puts him at risk of exposure to his father's
         smuggling gang and/or the local security disciplinary forces.'

28. Miss Capel urged me to accept this as it stood, being  the  view  of  a
    recognized 'country expert'.  However,  I  regard  it  as  particularly
    important  for  expert  witnesses  in  this  field  to  support   their
    conclusions by evidence, either documentary or, where it relates  to  a
    direct personal experience or communication, a precise reference. There
    is nothing of this kind in  Dr  Kashefi's  report;  so  it  has  to  be
    evaluated on the strength of the documentary sources she gives. This is
    particularly important in a  field  such  as  this,  where  the  expert
    witness can be confident that she will face no opposing evidence of the
    same kind, and where her  personal appearance for cross-examination  is
    unlikely to be required.

29. My conclusions on this point are as follows:

      a) the appellant is reasonably likely to be called up on return;

      b) if that happens when he had managed to make his  way  back  to  his
         home area, then his basic training would be likely to take place in
         that part of Iran;

      c) the evidence referred to by Dr Kashefi at  1.12  -  13  shows  that
         conscripts were serving on an international border  in  2013;  what
         happened then caused an outcry;

      d) by 2016, the commander of the border force was still  referring  to
         local deployment of conscripts in border areas as an objective: the
         making of previous similar statements suggested that it remained an
         aspiration, rather than "... an ongoing and active policy ...".

      e) while there is some likelihood that the appellant would  be  posted
         to do the rest of his military service in his home area,  there  is
         no basis, in view of the judge's findings (upheld  at  7)  for  any
         suggestion that this would put him at risk from the security forces
         himself;

      f) as for risk from his father's smuggling gang,  not  only  would  he
         have to be posted to their particular area of operations, but  they
         would have to recognize him, in military  uniform  and  now  nearly
         three years older, as the reluctant heir of his late father's role,
         and still be disposed to take personal vengeance  on  him  for  not
         complying with their wishes.

      g) In my view this would be no more than a chance  on  the  chance  of
         being posted to that  particular  point,  and  would  not  raise  a
         reasonable likelihood of the appellant's facing persecution on  the
         basis referred to at 17.

30. Internal relocation    Mr Tufan referred to the CPIN at 3.1.2:

         'Internal  relocation  to  another  area  of  Iran   is   generally
         reasonable if the  risk  will  not  be  present  in  the  place  of
         relocation but will depend on the  basis  of  the  threat  and  the
         particular circumstances of the person.'

    This is of course no more than a starting-point, as the passage  itself
    makes clear. As already explained, there would have no  basis  in  this
    case for any continuing individual threat in Teheran, even if there had
    been one in the appellant's home area, though the existence of  such  a
    threat there would be  the  only  reason  for  any  need  for  internal
    relocation.

31. If  that  were  to  become  relevant,  then  the  appellant's  relevant
    characteristics would be his age, now 20; his lack of any education  or
    formal work experience, and the fact that, although he made an overland
    journey of several thousand miles to this country, with the help of  an
    agent, he is apparently still living in local authority  accommodation.
    The CPIN itself makes an exception (2.3.3) for 'religious  minorities':
    while this appellant is a Sunni Muslim (5 - 10% of the population as  a
    whole, compared to 90 - 95% Shi'a: see 6,2,1), the very  small  numbers
    of Zoroastrians, Jews and Christians (only 0.3%, taken together)  makes
    it clear that these, and not Sunnis  are  the   'religious  minorities'
    referred to.

32. Dr Kashefi's anecdotal evidence at 1.39, while  no  doubt  reliable  in
    this case, as personal communications are  cited  for  it,  relates  to
    experiences of Sunnis during military service recounted by Kurds, and I
    do not regard it as relevant to any problems likely to be faced by this
    appellant, who is not a  Kurd,  in  Teheran,  or  for  that  matter  on
    military service, though that was not part of the case he was permitted
    to raise before me.

33. There was a good deal of discussion in argument as to the  real  effect
    on ordinary Iranians of the partial lifting of  sanctions  against  the
    regime. While the CPIN (10.2.1) gave the official rate of  unemployment
    as 10%, some sources in the appellant's further bundle for this hearing
    gave local rates as high as  60%.  However,  none  of  those  refer  to
    Teheran, and the only relevant national figure given is in a  New  York
    Times article of 1 January this year [AB 33], where an official  figure
    for the youth rate is given as "...  near  20  percent,  but  [unnamed]
    experts say it is really closer to 40%".

34. While the CPIN, citing an Australian government source at 10.1.1, gives
    the projected rate of growth of the Iranian economy from 2016 -  17  to
    the following year as 4 - 5%, while the World Bank (10.1.2) referred to
    a decline of 2% between 2015 and 2016: however "... the Iranian economy
    had bounced back sharply in 2016 at an estimated 6.4 percent".

35. On the other hand, Miss Capel referred to evidence (Guardian article 31
    December 2017), suggesting that prices of some basic food  items,  such
    as poultry and eggs, had risen by 'almost half'.  The  Washington  Post
    (28 December) referred to a named Teheran-based analyst as saying  that
    he would not be surprised if the general rate of inflation reached 12%.

36. Housing plans (CPIN 10.4) were directed only to results in 2022:  while
    civil service salaries  were  due  to  increase  (10.2.1),  Dr  Kashefi
    pointed out at 2.2, citing the Wall Street Journal,  that  some  public
    sector workers had not been paid for many months. Family support is the
    norm, and housing might be hard to find in Teheran without it (3.4).

37. Expansion, coupled with inflation, are characteristic of economies from
    which artificial controls have been rapidly lifted, as  with  Iran.  If
    this appellant had had any experience of leading  a  fully  independent
    life before he left his own country, then I have no doubt  that,  as  a
    young fit single man, he could cope with these conditions.

38. However, the appellant has not been  living  altogether  independently,
    either in Iran or in this country. If, contrary to the judge's findings
    as upheld by me, he were at any real risk in his home area, then  I  do
    not think it would be reasonable (see Januzi [2006] UKHL 5)  to  expect
    him to  deal  with  it  by  internal  relocation  to  Teheran,  without
    something to cushion him against problems he might face on arrival.

39. Mr Tufan suggested two sources of support of this kind.  The  first  is
    fully evidenced in the form of VARRP, which would entitle the appellant
    to up to �1,500 worth of reintegration assistance, including �500  cash
    on departure, and a variety of longer-term forms of support, once home.



40. I see nothing  in  Miss  Capel's  objection  that  VARRP  aid  is  only
    available for those who make a voluntary departure: it  is  up  to  the
    individual whether to do so, and no-one is entitled to  make  a  better
    case for himself by insisting on being compulsorily removed. As for her
    point about the decision on VARRP being in the hands of  the  AVR  [yet
    another acronym, standing for assisted voluntary  return]  team,  there
    are published criteria included in the web-site extract, none of  which
    would exclude this appellant. I have no doubt that he could  get  VARRP
    aid, if he chose to do so.

41. While that would certainly enable a young  fit  single  man  with  some
    experience of independent life to set himself up on return to  Teheran,
    the question is clearly more finely balanced in this appellant's  case.
    Though in the end I think the balance comes down  against  him,  it  is
    worth looking at Mr Tufan's other suggestion.

42. This was based on the appellant's mother having apparently had  $10,000
    available in savings  (see  his  statement,  already  referred  to,  at
    paragraph 20) to pay the agent to get him out of Iran  and  over  here.
    While that does not necessarily mean she had significant sums left,  it
    does suggest that this was  a  family  with  resources,  which  in  the
    absence of explanation might be assumed to be available. However,  once
    again the difficulty for Mr Tufan in relying on  any  support  of  this
    kind lies in the judge's acceptance, without further investigation,  of
    the appellant's evidence that he had irretrievably lost touch with  his
    family.

43. My final conclusions  are as follows:

     a) the appellant is not at real risk in his home area, for the reasons
        given by the judge, and upheld at 6 - 18;

     b) he would not be at real risk if called up for military  service  on
        return, for the reasons given at 29;

     c) if I were wrong on (a), then on balance it would be  reasonable  to
        expect him to  deal  with  that  risk  by  internal  relocation  to
        Teheran, for the reasons given at 39 - 41.
