                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Uganda  born  on  2nd  June  1980.  He
       applied for a permanent EU residence  card  in  approximately  April
       2014 as the spouse of Ms Iwona Szczgielska a citizen of  Poland  who
       is said to have exercised Treaty rights in the UK for  a  period  of
       more than five years.  This application was refused by the Secretary
       of State on 16th May 2014.  His  appeal  against  the  decision  was
       dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Rose in  a  determination  on
       the papers dated 25th August 2014.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Ransley on 16th August 2014 the basis that it was arguable that  the
       First-tier judge had erred in law in law in consideration of whether
       the appellant was entitled to a permanent resident card. Judge  Rose
       had found that the appellant had not shown his  spouse  had  been  a
       qualified person for the requisite 5 year period under Regulation 15
       of the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006  (henceforth  the  EEA
       Regulations). It was arguable that consideration had not been  given
       to the appellant's spouse's time as a job-seeker which was evidenced
       by some emails. It  was  also  arguable  that  Judge  Rose  had  not
       considered Article 8 ECHR in accordance with the law.

    3. The matter  came  before  me  to  consider  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions

    4. I initially had difficulties understanding Ms Goh's submissions with
       regards to the error of law under the EEA Regulations  however  with
       help  from  the  caseworker  from  the   Uganda   Community   Relief
       Association it was established that the complaint against the First-
       tier Tribunal was that there had been a failure  by  Judge  Rose  to
       understand that in fact the appellant's  spouse  had  been  employed
       from May 2012 as a staff nurse by the London Clinic so had only  had
       four months unemployment (and thus time as a jobseeker), as  it  was
       accepted that she was a student from October 2008 to  January  2012.
       The emails (dated 9th March 2012 and 15th May 2012) in fact referred
       to the job she eventually took with the London  Clinic  as  a  staff
       nurse and the one dated 14th March 2013 referred  to  the  promotion
       she achieved with the same employer.  In support of  the  contention
       that the appellant's spouse was so employed was a  letter  from  the
       London Clinic dated 27th March  2013  which  informed  her  she  was
       offered a promotion. It was accepted however that the  P60  for  the
       appellant's spouse had been mixed up with the P60 of  the  appellant
       and the wrong lower parts sellotaped to the tops so it looked as  if
       the appellant's spouse had only earned ï¿½341.36 from her work in  the
       year April 2012 to April 2013 when this was the amount the appellant
       had earned.

    5. It was also argued that Judge Rose had  erred  in  his  approach  to
       Article  8  ECHR.  What  was  written  at  paragraph   14   of   the
       determination was very confusing and there should not  have  been  a
       determination on this issue if  Judge  Rose  did  not  feel  he  had
       sufficient material to show family life.

    6.  Mr  Bramble  submitted  that  Judge  Rose  had  made  a  reasonable
       assessment of the evidence before him. If the appellant's spouse had
       been a jobseeker from January 2012 to March 2013 (when the  definite
       evidence of employment was available), and thus for 14 months,  then
       it was fair of Judge Rose to find that the three  emails   and  CRCB
       check evidence did not suffice to show that she  qualified  as  such
       under the EEA Regulations.

    7. Mr Bramble argued that Judge Rose had  dealt  with  Article  8  ECHR
       adequately. Paragraph 14 may be a bit  unclear  but  that  this  was
       resolved by paragraph 16 of the determination. It was  not  relevant
       that Judge Rose had not looked at the matter under  the  Immigration
       Rules as there was no argument it could have succeeded in  this  way
       by the appellant.

Conclusions - Error of Law

    8. Judge Rose did not err in law in the  determination  of  the  appeal
       under the EEA Regulations. If the appellant or  his  representatives
       have sellotaped the wrong part of the P60s back together  so  as  to
       swap the appellant's and Ms Szczgielska's earnings over for the year
       ending April 2013 then this was an error on their part. Judge  Rose,
       who dealt with this matter on the papers, could not be  expected  to
       have worked this out, particularly because there was no other  clear
       evidence before him (for instance a contract of employment, payslips
       or a  letter  offering  employment)  that  the  Ms  Szczgielska  had
       obtained a job as a nurse with the London Clinic as a result  of  an
       interview in March 2012; started work in May 2012; and continued  in
       the same employment to date with a  promotion  in  March  2013.  The
       documents before Judge Rose were consistent with this  history,  but
       it was not spelt out to him in a statement and the  documents  alone
       were extremely confusing due to the way that they were presented.

    9. If the appellant wishes to obtain a permanent card he needs to  make
       a new application to the Secretary  of  State  with  clear  evidence
       showing that Ms Szczgielska started work for the  London  Clinic  in
       May 2012 having received a job offer  in  March  2012,  as  well  as
       evidencing her studies from October 2008 to  January  2012  and  her
       work  since  May  2012,  and  any  other  matters  required  by  the
       application form. It would be advisable that the history of  all  of
       her activities as a qualified person under Regulation 6 of  the  EEA
       Regulations is set  out  in  a  chronologically  arranged  statement
       referring to the documents in support so that the way in  which  the
       appellant and Ms Szczgielska are said to meet Regulation 15  of  the
       EEA Regulations is clear.

   10. Judge Rose did however err in his treatment of the  Article  8  ECHR
       appeal. As Mr Bramble accepts what is said at paragraph  14  of  the
       determination is  extremely  confused.  If  there  was  insufficient
       evidence of family life then the determination should  have  stopped
       there.

   11. If there was sufficient evidence of family life then  it  was  clear
       that the appellant and Ms Szczgielska had a current lawful right  to
       remain in the UK as there was clear evidence that Ms Szczgielska was
       a Polish national currently exercising Treaty rights as a worker and
       the appellant was her spouse. Ms Szczgielska was therefore  entitled
       to have the appellant, her spouse, with her in the UK  as  a  family
       member in accordance with  Regulations  6,  7  and  17  of  the  EEA
       Regulations  and  any  interference  with  that  right  was  not  in
       accordance with the law, as it is clear that the appellant was  (and
       is) entitled to an EEA residence card on this basis.

   12. As a result what was said about the interference being in accordance
       with the law at paragraph 14 of the determination of Judge  Rose  is
       incorrect, and what is said at  paragraphs  15  to  18  wrong  as  a
       consequence.

Conclusions - Re-making Human Rights

   13. I accept that the appellant and  Ms  Szczgielska  have  family  life
       together in the UK as they are married  and  there  was  substantial
       evidence before the Tribunal placing them at the  same  address.  In
       the circumstances - and for the reasons set out above  at  paragraph
       11 - I find any removal would interfere with their right to  respect
       for family life and would not be in accordance with the law.

Decision

   14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  an
       error on a point of law in the determination  of  the  appeal  under
       Article 8 ECHR, but not with respect to  the  determination  of  the
       appeal under the EEA Regulations.

   15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside with respect to
       the determination of the appeal under Article 8 ECHR

   16. The appeal is remade so that the appeal is allowed on  human  rights
       grounds.

   17. The appeal against refusal of a  permanent  residence  card  remains
       dismissed under the EEA Regulations.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

    In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by
    allowing it on human rights grounds, I have considered whether to  make
    a fee award. I was not asked to make a fee award and  do  not  find  it
    appropriate to do so in all the circumstances.
