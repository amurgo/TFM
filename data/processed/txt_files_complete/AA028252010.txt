                            NOTICE OF ABANDONMENT


1. The Secretary of State has permission to appeal  against  the  First-tier
   Tribunal  determination  allowing  the  claimant's  appeal  against   her
   decision to refuse to grant asylum, humanitarian protection or  leave  to
   remain in the United Kingdom on human rights grounds.  The claimant is  a
   citizen of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) from birth, who grew up in
   the Democratic Republic of Korea before coming to the United Kingdom.

2. At the hearing today, the Secretary of State stated that  refugee  status
   had been granted to this claimant following the judgment of the Court  of
   Appeal in SP and ors (North Korea) [2012] EWCA Civ 114.

3. Rule 17A of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  (as
   amended) requires a party to whom leave to enter or remain is granted  to
   notify the Tribunal of that occurrence, which this claimant failed to do.
    Section 104(4A) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  (as
   amended) requires the Upper Tribunal to treat as abandoned an appeal by a
   claimant who has been granted leave to enter  or  remain  in  the  United
   Kingdom, unless notice is given by  such  claimant  pursuant  to  section
   104(4B) within 1 month of leave being granted, stating that they wish  to
   pursue the appeal. No notice has been received under section 104(4B).

4. Accordingly, this appeal stands as abandoned by the appellant.

5. Pursuant to paragraph 17  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
   Rules 2008 (as amended), the Secretary of State has leave to withdraw her
   case before the Upper Tribunal.

6. There being no underlying appeal, the  Secretary  of  State's  appeal  is
   hereby dismissed.
