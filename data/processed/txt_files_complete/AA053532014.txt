                                   MR R M
                         (ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE)
                                                                 Respondents
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Wilding (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Ms Murshed, Counsel, instructed by AB Mackenzie
      Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The appellant, born November 16, 1986, citizen of Uganda,  entered  the
    United Kingdom on July 6, 2010. He claimed asylum on September 22, 2010
    but the respondent refused his application  on  October  8,  2010.  The
    First-tier Tribunal heard his appeal on October 15, 2010 and his appeal
    was dismissed. Further representations were made on November  12,  2010
    but the respondent did not find these representations amounted to fresh
    grounds and no appeal was offered. Removal directions were  issued  for
    November 24, 2010 and the appellant applied for a stay on that  removal
    by issuing judicial review proceedings. Mr Justice Langstaff ordered  a
    stay on the proceedings. In 2012 an application outside  of  the  Rules
    was submitted but this application was rejected with no right of appeal
    as he had no legal basis to be in the country. On  July  22,  2014  the
    appellant was detained working illegally and a decision to  remove  him
    under section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. This  did  not
    give him an in-country right of appeal.

 3. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on July 30, 2014  under  Section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  and  Duty
    Judge Borsada directed the respondent provide evidence of  whether  the
    earlier  decision  of  November  24,  2010  had  been  certified.   The
    respondent failed to comply with this direction  and  on  September  1,
    2010 the matter came before myself as Duty Judge  and  I  directed  the
    matter be listed for a substantive hearing  and  this  issue  could  be
    dealt with at the substantive hearing.

 4. On October 8, 2014 the matter came  before  Judge  of  the  First  Tier
    Tribunal Rothwell (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  "FtTJ")  and  in
    determination promulgated on October 9, 2014 he allowed the  appeal  on
    asylum grounds.

 5. The respondent lodged grounds of appeal on  October  29,  2014  and  on
    November  14,  2014  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Deans   gave
    permission to appeal finding there were arguable grounds that the  FtTJ
    had erred by dealing with the appeal when the immigration decision  did
    not provide for a right of appeal.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUES

 6. Mr Wilding and Ms Murshed confirmed the decision letter of November 24,
    2010 did not certify the appellant's claim under the Section 94 of  the
    2002 Act. They also both  agreed  that  the  appellant  had  lodged  an
    application in 2012 outside of the Rules.


 7. My attention was drawn to BA (Nigeria) and PE (Cameroon) v SSHD  [2009]
    EWCA Civ 119. At paragraph [32] Lord Hope concluded-

         "... claims which are not certified under section  94  or  excluded
         under section 96, if rejected, should  be  allowed  to  proceed  to
         appeal in-country under sections 82 and 92, whether or not they are
         accepted by the Secretary of State as fresh claims"

 8. The only challenge in the respondent's grounds of appeal was  that  the
    FtTJ had erred by hearing  the  appeal  in  light  of  the  section  10
    decision.


 9. The above case of BA coupled with the fact a  human  rights  claim  was
    made in 2012 (before the 2014 removal  decision)  meant  the  FtTJ  was
    correct in hearing the appeal as there was an in-country appeal right.


10. The respondent's  grounds  of  appeal  had  no  basis  and  Mr  Wilding
    acknowledged that this was the only issue raised in the grounds.

    ERROR OF LAW ASSESSMENT

11. There was no error of law as acknowledged by Mr Wilding and I therefore
    dismiss the appeal.


    WASTED COSTS


12. Ms Murshed invited me to make a wasted costs order for today's hearing.
    I declined on the basis the respondent had  been  given  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

Decision

13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not disclose  an  error  in
    law. The original decision shall stand.

14. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended)  an  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. An
    order was made in the First-tier and I see  no  reason  to  amend  that
    order.
