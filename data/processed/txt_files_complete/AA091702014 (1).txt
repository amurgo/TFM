Representation:

For the appellant:     Ms R Evans, instructed by WTB Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms R Petterson, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is Ms RK's appeal against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Manuel promulgated 27.3.15, dismissing on all grounds her  appeal
    against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State,  dated  7.10.14,  to
    refuse her asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights claims.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Osborne  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    22.4.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 31.3.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. I find such error of law in the making of the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal as to require the decision of  Judge  Manuel  to  be  set
    aside and remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be remade  afresh,  in
    accordance with the attached directions. Having announced that decision
    at the error of law appeal hearing, I reserved my reasons, which I  now
    give.

 5. The relevant background can  be  summarised  briefly  as  follows.  The
    appellant, a national of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)  claims
    that in 2011 she became a member of the UDPS,  became  an  activist  in
    charge of publicity and held meetings at her home. She was arrested and
    detained for 2 days in December 2011, and arrested and detained  for  5
    days in February 2012. On 31.12.13 she was at the airport  in  Kinshasa
    following an attempted coup. She was seen by a  solider  who  had  been
    involved in her detention in 2011 and as a  result  detained  again  on
    suspicion of being involved in the recent  attack.  She  was  taken  to
    Makala prison, where  she  was  tortured  and  raped  on  a  number  of
    occasions, accused of trying to overthrow the President. She escaped in
    May 2014 through the intervention of her uncle. In June 2014 a man  who
    provided her with a passport took her to the airport. She flew to Kenya
    and then to the UK, arriving on 13.6.14. She claimed asylum on 20.6.14.
    At that time she had already conceived, being pregnant with twins,  the
    father being CL, a British citizen she knew from the DRC and  whom  she
    met again in the UK. She fears that on  return  to  DRC  she  would  be
    arrested and killed by the government because she escaped from prison.

 6. In summary, the grounds  assert  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    failed to attach appropriate weight to the asylum interview  record  in
    favour  of  the  appellant's  witness  statement;  erred   in   drawing
    conclusions as to the expected behaviour of  a  rape  victim;  made  an
    adverse credibility finding against a victim of sexual assault  due  to
    an absence of psychological evidence of trauma,  raising  a  disturbing
    and unlawful precedent; erred in  her  assessment  of  credibility  and
    relied on a misunderstanding of the country evidence  relating  to  the
    appellant's account to find that the incident of 23.12.11 did not  take
    place; failed to take  into  account  the  fact  that  the  appellant's
    account is corroborated by the objective evidence in the bundle; made a
    finding at �49 that it is not credible that the  appellant  would  have
    been able to leave the airport in Kinshasa which is unsupported by  any
    country evidence; Relied at �58  on  an  apparent  discrepancy  in  the
    appellant's evidence which was not put to the appellant at the hearing;
    and erred in relying on this last point without  giving  the  appellant
    the opportunity to explain.

 7. In granting permission to appeal,  Judge  Osborne  found  that  in  any
    otherwise  careful  and  well-reasoned  decision,  "it  is  nonetheless
    arguable that the Judge erred in relying  on  the  absence  of  medical
    evidence of the psychological effect upon the appellant of the repeated
    rapes. It is arguable  that  the  judge  erred  in  making  an  adverse
    credibility finding against the appellant on the basis  of  a  lack  of
    expert psychological evidence following the appellant's failure to seek
    counselling. It is further arguable that the judge erred in failing  to
    take account of the fact that the appellant's account of  the  incident
    on  23.12.11  is  corroborated  by  the  objective  evidence   in   the
    appellant's bundle."

 8. At �50 the judge addressed contradictions by the appellant  as  to  how
    many times she was raped in detention. She was asked in evidence  about
    the psychological impact on her, and said that she  had  suffered  some
    memory loss but had received no counselling and  no  medical  treatment
    other than for a skin rash. At �53 the judge notes that the CMR  record
    states that the appellant intended to  provide  medical  evidence,  but
    that no such evidence has been adduced. The  Judge  continued,  "It  is
    reasonable to expect that a victim of repeated rape whilst in detention
    would suffer psychologically.  The  absence  of  any  medical  evidence
    together with the contradictory evidence regarding the number of  times
    the appellant claims she was raped leads me to disbelieve  her  account
    regarding arrest on 31 December 2013 and detention until May  2014.  It
    follows that I also do not believe the  appellant's  account  regarding
    escape from prison."

 9. It is clear from the above that although it wasn't the only  strand  of
    evidence relied on, the judge's view on the  absence  of  psychological
    evidence was crucial to the  assessment  of  credibility  of  the  rape
    claim, and pivotal to the credibility  assessment  of  the  appellant's
    account of arrest, detention and escape from custody.

10. The judge was factually wrong about the CMR record,  which  is  in  the
    case file before me and which states that there  would  be  no  medical
    evidence. Mr Evans confirms the appellant's representatives' case  that
    at no time did they ever suggest they would produce medical evidence.

11. More significantly the judge appears to have reached a conclusion  that
    a person who has been raped must have suffered psychological damage and
    must therefore be able to produce expert evidence to that effect, or at
    least to demonstrate that she has had counselling. This is an  entirely
    subjective opinion made without evidential support that  is  irrational
    and cannot be objectively sustained. There may or  may  not  have  been
    psychological trauma, and the  appellant  may  or  may  not  have  been
    offered or declined counselling or psychological therapy. That she  has
    not produced any evidence of such cannot in and of  itself  render  her
    claim not credible.

12. The comments at �54 are also disturbing. There the judge notes that the
    appellant did not become pregnant as consequence of repeated rape,  but
    yet conceived twins within a week of her arrival in the UK. At �55  the
    judge  recorded  that  the  appellant   denied   using   contraception.
    Apparently, this followed cross-examination as to whether she had  been
    taking contraceptive pills at the time  she  was  detained  and  raped,
    which she said she was not. She was only asked about medication and not
    asked about other forms of contraception. The judge appears to rely  on
    a conclusion that the appellant could not have been raped  because  she
    did not become pregnant when not using contraception.  This  conclusion
    is very obviously flawed and in error of law.

13.  These  flawed  findings  so  fundamentally  underpin   the   remaining
    credibility findings that the decision as a whole cannot stand for this
    reason, regardless of the other grounds of appeal.

14. At �26 the judge  addressed  the  ground  of  appeal  that  the  asylum
    interview was not recorded and a request at interview, repeated in  two
    written requests, for  a  gender  preference  of  interviewer  was  not
    complied  with.   The   judge   acknowledges   that   the   appellant's
    representatives wrote to the home office on 9.7.14 and again on 15.9.14
    requesting a female interviewer. However,  the  judge  was  in  factual
    error in stating "it is not correct to state  that  the  appellant  had
    requested a female interviewer and interpreter at the time she  claimed
    asylum," as asserted in the skeleton argument. The judge relied to  the
    letter of 9.7.14 which  indicates  that  their  client  was  asked  for
    preferences at the time of her screening interview and stated  she  has
    none. However, we understand that our  client  has  been  a  victim  of
    sexual assault and she does in fact prefer to be interviewed with  only
    women present." The judge has misunderstood the facts. It  is  recorded
    at A13 of the respondent's bundle that when she made an appointment for
    her asylum application she requested a female interpreter, however, she
    confirmed she was content to be interviewed by a male.  The  letter  of
    9.7.14 explained that she had not felt confident enough to maintain her
    earlier request when asked in person if she was happy to be interviewed
    by a male person. Within a few days of  that  screening  interview  the
    request was made in writing. In the circumstances,  given  the  factual
    error,  and  the  failure  to  comply  with  the  request  for   female
    interviewer and interpreter, the judge has failed to adequately address
    the ground of appeal that less weight should be given to the  interview
    answers than her  witness  statement.  It  remains  arguable  that  the
    Secretary of State failed to comply with her  own  policy  guidance  on
    this issue, to the prejudice of the appellant.

15. There are a number  of  other,  more  minor,  errors  in  the  decision
    attacked in the grounds of appeal.

16. For example, between �33 to �40 the judge addressed the  2011  incident
    and background evidence that the alternative swearing  in  ceremony  of
    the opposition leader was held at his home, when the  appellant  stated
    that swearing in ceremony was supposed to  take  place  at  the  martyr
    stadium and only found out afterwards that this was a strategy  by  the
    UDPS. The background evidence, as recorded by the judge at �38, is that
    supporters and  officials  of  the  UDPS  gathered  at  the  opposition
    leader's home. The judge concluded that if the appellant was an  active
    member of the party it is reasonable to expect that she would have been
    one of the members present  at  the  house  instead  of  attending  the
    stadium. However, it is clear  from  the  background  information  that
    there was a plan, circulated  as  a  ruse,  to  hold  the  swearing  in
    ceremony at the stadium. In response to that information the background
    information confirms that crowds of UDPS  supporters  attended  rallies
    held at the stadium to celebrate the event  and  that  the  authorities
    were engaged in dispersing these supporters. It was never claimed  that
    the appellant was part of the UDPS leadership, or a person with such  a
    role or rank as to be privy to the secret plan to hold the event at his
    home instead of at the stadium in order  to  deceive  the  authorities.
    Many other UDPS supporters did the same as  the  appellant,  apparently
    also unaware of the ruse. In the circumstances, to  hold  this  against
    the appellant was unfair and unjustified. The judge also holds  against
    the appellant at �39 that she did not mention this strategy at the time
    of her interview. However, she was not asked about it or what  happened
    after the incident.

17. Similarly, at �58 the judge claims that at �36 of her witness statement
    the appellant stated that she got to know CL, the father of her  twins,
    "a little bit" before she came to the  UK  because  she  had  telephone
    contact and met him a year ago in the DRC.  The judge  contrasted  this
    interpretation of her statement with the evidence of CL,  who  said  he
    had last spoken with the appellant in 2011 and had not been back to the
    DRC since 2001. In fact what the appellant said about meeting CL was "I
    met him year ago in DRC also" with the 's' missing in a typo from  what
    was obviously meant to be "years ago," meaning she  had  also  met  him
    years ago in the DRC. The difficulty is that this supposed  discrepancy
    was not put to the appellant at the appeal  hearing  and  she  was  not
    given the opportunity to address it.

18. In her submissions, Ms  Petterson  resisted  some  of  the  grounds  of
    appeal, including  the  issue  of  the  failure  to  provide  a  female
    interviewer, as not material to the outcome of the appeal. However, she
    conceded that there were  clear  errors  in  relation  to  the  judge's
    unsustainably subjective views as to how a rape  victim  would  behave,
    and whether the absence of expert evidence of psychological  trauma  or
    of counselling could properly undermine the credibility of  the  claim,
    as outlined above. Thus Ms Petterson did not resist the  setting  aside
    of the decision and agreed that it should be remitted to the First-tier
    Tribunal to be heard again.

19. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the  Upper  Tribunal.  The  errors  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings of fact and the  conclusions
    from those facts so that there has not been a  valid  determination  of
    the issues in the appeal.

20. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the appellant of a fair hearing and  that
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding  which  is  necessary
    for the decision in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

21. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside set aside the decision.

                    I remit the making of the decision in the appeal to  the
                    First-tier Tribunal  in  accordance  with  the  attached
                    directions.

Consequential Directions

 1.  The  appeal  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  sitting   at
    Manchester, with an estimated length of hearing of 3 hours;

 2. The appeal is to be heard with an all-female court;

 3. The appeal may be heard by any female judge, except Judge Manuel;

 4. The appeal is to be remade afresh with no findings preserved;

 5. It is anticipated that  there  will  be  two  witnesses  including  the
    appellant;

 6. An interpreter in French (African) will be required;

 7. Not later than 10 working days before the appeal hearing date  notified
    by the tribunal, the appellant must serve on the respondent  and  lodge
    with the Tribunal a two copies of a single consolidated bundle, indexed
    and paginated, comprising all objective  and  subject  material  to  be
    relied on, together with any skeleton argument or case authorities. The
    appellant cannot assume that any previously  submitted  materials  have
    been retained. The Tribunal will not accept documents submitted on  the
    day of the hearing.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
However, given the circumstances, I make an anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
