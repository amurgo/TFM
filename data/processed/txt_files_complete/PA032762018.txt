Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Chelvan, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                    DECISION AND REASONS ON ERROR OF LAW

    1. The appellant appeals with the permission of the First-tier  Tribunal
       against a decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Bart-Stewart
       dismissing his appeal against a decision of the respondent, dated  15
       February 2018, refusing his protection claim.

    2. The appellant is an Algerian national. He arrived in  the  UK  on  21
       April 2009 with leave to enter in order to study. He  claimed  asylum
       on 1 August 2016. He gave an account of fearing serious ill-treatment
       at the hands of his family, who had been abusive towards him  in  the
       past, because he is gay.  The  respondent  accepted  the  appellant's
       account of what had happened to him in  the  past,  even  though  his
       delay in claiming asylum was behaviour which undermined  his  overall
       credibility. As to the situation on return, the respondent considered
       the appellant did not risk persecution if he were to live openly as a
       gay man in Algeria. He could relocate away from his family.  Reliance
       was placed on the country guidance decision in OO (Gay  Men)  Algeria
       CG [2016] UKUT 00065 (IAC).

    3. It is helpful to set out the summary of country guidance provided  by
       the Upper Tribunal in OO (Algeria):

           "1.    Although the  Algerian  Criminal  Code  makes  homosexual
           behaviour unlawful, the authorities do not seek to prosecute gay
           men and there is no real risk  of  prosecution,  even  when  the
           authorities become aware of such  behaviour.  In  the  very  few
           cases  where  there  has  been  a  prosecution  for   homosexual
           behaviour, there has been some other feature that has given rise
           to the prosecution. The state does not actively seek out gay men
           in order to take any form of  action  against  them,  either  by
           means of prosecution or by subjecting gay men to other forms  of
           persecutory ill-treatment.

           2. Sharia law is not applied against gay men  in  Algeria.   The
           criminal law is entirely secular and discloses no manifestation,
           at all, of Sharia law in its application.

           3.  The  only  risk  of  ill-treatment  at  a  level  to  become
           persecution likely to be encountered by a gay man in Algeria  is
           at the hands of his own family, after they have discovered  that
           he is gay. There is no reliable evidence such  as  to  establish
           that a gay man,  identified  as  such,  faces  a  real  risk  of
           persecutory ill-treatment from persons outside his own family.

           4. Where a gay man remains living with his family to whom he has
           disclosed his sexual orientation in circumstances where they are
           prepared to tolerate that, his decision to live  discreetly  and
           to conceal his homosexuality outside  the  family  home  is  not
           taken to avoid persecution but  to  avoid  shame  or  disrespect
           being brought upon his family. That means that he has chosen  to
           live discreetly, not to avoid persecution but for  reasons  that
           do not give rise to a right to international protection.

           5. Where a gay  man  has  to  flee  his  family  home  to  avoid
           persecution from family members, in his place of  relocation  he
           will attract no real risk of persecution because, generally,  he
           will not live openly as a gay man.  As  the  evidence  does  not
           establish that he will  face  a  real  risk  of  persecution  if
           subsequently suspected to be a gay man,  his  decision  to  live
           discreetly and to conceal his sexual orientation  is  driven  by
           respect for social  mores  and  a  desire  to  avoid  attracting
           disapproval of a type that falls well  below  the  threshold  of
           persecution. Quite apart from that, an Algerian man  who  has  a
           settled preference for same sex relationships may well  continue
           to entertain doubts as  to  his  sexuality  and  not  to  regard
           himself as a gay man, in any event.

           6. For these reasons, a gay man from Algeria will be entitled to
           be recognised as a refugee only if he shows  that,  due  to  his
           personal circumstances, it  would  be  unreasonable  and  unduly
           harsh  to  expect  him  to  relocate  within  Algeria  to  avoid
           persecution from family members, or because he has a  particular
           characteristics that might, unusually and contrary  to  what  is
           generally to be expected, give rise  to  a  risk  of  attracting
           disapproval at the  highest  level  of  the  possible  range  of
           adverse  responses  from  those   seeking   to   express   their
           disapproval of the fact of his sexual orientation."

    4. The appellant appealed on  protection  and  article  8  grounds.  The
       appeal was heard at Taylor House on 28 September 2018. In  a  lengthy
       and detailed decision, the judge gave reasons for coming  to  similar
       conclusions to the respondent about the appellant's claim. She  found
       that parts of the evidence suggested the appellant was  not  at  risk
       from his family because, for example, he had continued to  live  with
       them for four years after 'coming out' and  they  had  supported  his
       studies abroad. His evidence about being cut off from his family  had
       not been consistent. In any event, he could reasonably be expected to
       relocate away from his family, who  lived  in  Algiers,  and,  whilst
       there was discrimination against openly gay men in Algeria, this  did
       not amount to persecution. She applied OO (Algeria).

    5. Permission to appeal was refused by the First-tier Tribunal on  three
       of the four grounds submitted. Ground 1 argued  the  judge  erred  by
       going behind the concession made by the respondent that the appellant
       had given an accurate account of past events.  Ground  3  argued  the
       judge erred by failing to identify an alternative place of relocation
       in Algeria. Ground 4 argued the judge erred by dismissing the  appeal
       on private  life  grounds  given  the  acceptance  of  discrimination
       encountered by openly gay men in Algeria.

    6. However, permission to appeal was granted by the First-tier  Tribunal
       in respect of one of the four grounds (ground 2).  At  paragraph  57,
       the judge had recorded that she did not consider  the  expert  report
       adduced by the appellant, prepared by Professor Emile  George  Joffï¿½,
       provided any reason to depart from the country guidance. She recorded
       that counsel had not referred to  the  report.  The  grounds  seeking
       permission to appeal argued the judge had erred  because  the  report
       had been referenced in counsel's skeleton argument.

    7. The grounds argued this error was material because, had the judge had
       regard  to  the  report,  she  would  have  considered  whether   the
       accumulation  of  discriminatory  measures  might  be  considered  as
       persecution in accordance with Article 9(1)(b) of  the  Qualification
       Directive[1].

    8. The Upper Tribunal subsequently granted permission to argue  all  the
       grounds.

    9. I heard submissions from the representatives as to whether the  judge
       made a material error of law in her decision. I had  the  benefit  of
       receiving skeleton arguments from both representatives in advance  of
       the hearing for which I am  grateful.  Mr  Chelvan  also  provided  a
       further skeleton responding to Mr Kotas's skeleton. I shall  consider
       each ground in turn.

Ground 1

   10.  Mr  Chelvan's  first  ground  essentially  argues  that  the   judge
       materially erred in law by going behind certain important concessions
       of fact made by the respondent in the reasons for refusal letter (see
       Carcabuk and Bla (00TH01426) unreported, 8 May 2000, IAT, referred to
       in NR (Jamaica) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 856, [2010] INLR 169).

   11. In summarising  the  respondent's  reasons  for  refusal,  the  judge
       stated,

           "14.    [The  appellant's]  account  of  ill-treatment  he   had
           received from his family because of his sexuality is  internally
           consistent  as  is  his  account  of  the  process   about   his
           realisation of his sexuality and coming  out.  He  had  provided
           copies of emails from his partner and  supporting  letters  from
           friends and associates with ID consistent with his  account  and
           as such given weight in support of his  claim.  He  [had]  given
           evidence of activities in London including attending  Gay  Pride
           in 2010 and 2011 and volunteering with Naz, an  LGBT  group  and
           provided a letter from Naz confirming  this.  His  volunteering,
           attendance at  events  and  supporting  letters  are  considered
           consistent with his account of being open about his sexuality in
           the UK and weight was given  to  the  supporting  evidence.  The
           appellant provided a detailed account of his claim to be  a  gay
           man which is internally and externally consistent, detailed  and
           plausible and is accepted.

           15.    The appellant said he fears his family and  this  is  the
           reason he will act differently if returned  to  Algeria.  It  is
           based on  fear  of  repercussions  from  his  family  and  their
           unpredictability given their previous treatment towards him when
           last  in  Algeria.  Much  of  what  he  explains  he  fears   is
           speculation. People in  Algeria  are  not  generally  persecuted
           because of  their  sexuality.  It  is  more  a  case  of  family
           disapproval. Therefore, the appellant is not considered at  risk
           by relocating away from his family. He also  claims  to  have  a
           fear emanating from  the  state  however  as  shown  in  country
           evidence the authorities do  not  persecute  people  in  Nigeria
           (sic) because of  their  sexuality.  Treatment  of  gay  men  in
           Algeria does not generally amount  to  persecution.  Whilst  the
           appellant received threats from his family, it is noted he lived
           with  them  for  over  four  years  after  they  discovered  his
           sexuality. It is noted that the risk to gay men  in  Algeria  is
           only from family members not the wider community.

           16.    It is noted that the appellant  fears  returning  to  the
           wider Algiers region in Algeria. It is accepted he is a gay  man
           however he had only indicated his fear emanates from his family,
           their influence and the  authorities  of  Algeria.  He  had  not
           substantiated their power or influence within Algeria other than
           that they are rich. There is reference [to] the country guidance
           case ...

           17.     Taking  this  in  the  round,  it  is   considered   not
           unreasonable or unduly harsh for the appellant  to  relocate  to
           another part of  Algeria.  People  who  fear  their  family  may
           reasonably relocate and not suffer mistreatment that amounts  to
           persecution. The evidence shows the authorities do not routinely
           persecute  people  because  of  their  sexuality,  perceived  or
           otherwise. The appellant had demonstrated considerable  personal
           fortitude in relocating to the UK and attempting to establish  a
           life  here.  He  offered  no  explanation  why  he   could   not
           demonstrate  the  same  resolve  to  re-establish  his  life  in
           Algeria. It is concluded he has skills he could utilise  on  his
           return to Algeria including an ability to  gain  employment.  As
           such he does not qualify for international protection."

   12. Mr Chelvan took me through the relevant paragraphs of the reasons for
       refusal letter which the judge was summarising. It is clear that  the
       respondent accepted the appellant's claim to be a gay man  (paragraph
       30). It is clear the respondent  found  the  appellant  had  given  a
       detailed and internally consistent account of the abuse  he  suffered
       from his family both because of his "effeminate" nature  and  because
       of his sexuality (paragraph 31). The letter  referred  to  background
       information which confirmed that, within their own  family,  an  LGBT
       person who came out may face abuse, including physical  violence  and
       forced marriage (paragraph 32).  The  respondent  accepted  that  the
       appellant suffered mentally and physically at the hands of his family
       and that  they  treated  him  "like  a  woman"  (paragraph  33).  The
       respondent  accepted  the  appellant  had  demonstrated   a   genuine
       subjective fear of returning to Algeria. However, his  fear  was  not
       objectively  well-founded  because  he  could   internally   relocate
       (paragraph 38).

   13. Mr Chelvan argued that  the  concessions  contained  in  the  refusal
       letter had not been withdrawn by the presenting officer and therefore
       the judge erred in going behind them. He  highlighted  the  following
       passage  from  the  decision  in  which,   he   argued,   the   judge
       impermissibly  went  behind  the  respondent's  acceptance  that  the
       appellant presents as being effeminate:

           "47.   The appellant's case is that because of what he considers
           an effeminate presentation he cannot live discreetly  as  a  gay
           man in Algeria and would be  subject  to  persecution.  However,
           there is no suggestion that these  features  are  pronounced  or
           have become more pronounced since [being] in  the  UK.  He  made
           reference in his interview to his looks however I am not at  all
           clear what he meant. He refers to how he stands and how he  sits
           but other than a reference to crossing his legs this too is  not
           clear. I am unaware of any difference in the way a person who is
           gay or homosexual would open the door as is referred to  in  the
           interview. In his presentation at the  hearing  the  most  [that
           may] be discerned is slightly exaggerated hand movements."

   14. It is helpful to set out the paragraphs following on from  the  above
       in order to get a fuller understanding of the judge's conclusions:

           "48.   He is not in a relationship in  the  UK.  This  seems  to
           relate to his concerns with regards to his religion rather  than
           society in general. He said  that  before  he  left  Algeria  he
           presented as effeminate however he was able to  seek  refuge  in
           the mosque and have conversations with  other  people.  This  is
           contradictory to his claim that such  presentation  put  him  at
           risk. It might be thought that the  mosque  would  be  the  last
           place where he could seek refuge when  presenting  in  a  manner
           contrary to his religion and societal norms. Similarly, he  said
           that when he used to play video games friends would come to  his
           house. They noted his interest in boys however it  appeared  not
           to be an issue.

           49.    He  refers  to  being  emasculated  by  his  family.  His
           evidence is that his family considered  him  effeminate  from  a
           young age and he came out with  his  family  in  2005,  4  years
           before he left Algeria and when he would have been 19 years old.
           Although there is no supporting medical evidence  he  claims  to
           have a  condition  whereby  he  had  developed  breasts  and  he
           underwent breast reduction surgery. In relation to  the  violent
           treatment he claimed to have suffered at the hands of his father
           and his brother, his witness statements indicate that all of the
           siblings were subjected to violence and  his  own  ill-treatment
           did  not  relate  specifically  to  his  sexuality.  The  family
           supported his decision to travel abroad to study and funded  him
           for 2 years when they then requested him to return  home.  There
           is an inconsistent claim that the father  and  brother  rejected
           him when [at] the same time he says his  father  wanted  him  to
           return to Algeria and he had been  able  to  have  conversations
           with his brother. He also said that his father was  secular  but
           in contradiction to this that his father  beat  his  sister  for
           wearing the hijab.

           50.    The evidence of Dr Seddon is that  the  treatment  to  be
           expected by a gay man's family is in some respects dependent  on
           class and education. The appellant's evidence is that his family
           was wealthy. His father had  worked  in  a  government  position
           until made redundant and his brother [had a] restaurant. Despite
           having  such  a  large  family  they  were  able  to  fund   the
           appellant's travels and studies. This  supports  the  conclusion
           that  the  appellant's  family  even  if  they  disapprove  were
           unlikely to cause him physical harm. If there is any  risk,  the
           appellant can relocate  to  another  part  of  Algeria.  On  his
           evidence he has already been cut off from them and there  is  no
           reason given why they would seek to track him down.

           51.    Neither in his oral or written evidence has the appellant
           given examples  of  any  physical  threat  or  harm  experienced
           outside the confines of  his  family.  He  said  that  [he  was]
           practised in trading insults with people who abuse him and  wish
           to harm him. OO (Algeria) confirms that this is  the  extent  of
           the adverse treatment  that  a  gay  man  in  Algeria  might  be
           expected to endure. Regrettably such treatment is  not  confined
           to Algeria and in itself does not amount to persecution."

   15. The judge  then  proceeded  to  assess  the  examples  given  by  the
       appellant of two threats he had received outside the confines of  his
       family. Mr Chelvan  pointed  out  that  the  examples  he  gave,  one
       relating to the appellant's employment in an IT company and the other
       relating to  a  lecturer  at  university,  both  took  place  in  the
       appellant's home area, Algiers, where  the  respondent  accepted  the
       appellant could not return to. The respondent's conclusion  that  the
       appellant could exercise internal  flight  was  consistent  with  the
       finding that the appellant was at risk in his home area. The question
       of internal relocation only arises if the appellant has shown a well-
       founded  fear  of  persecution  in  his  home  area  (see  R  on  the
       application of Altin Vallaj v A Special Adjudicator [2001] INLR 455).
       The judge had erred in law, argued Mr Chelvan.

   16. In his submissions, Mr Kotas argued that the judge's findings did not
       go behind the two matters which had been accepted by the  respondent,
       namely, that the appellant is gay  and  that  he  had  suffered  ill-
       treatment at the hands of his family.

   17. In my judgement, ground 1 does not disclose a material error  of  law
       in the judge's decision. Of  course,  judges  should  not  go  behind
       concessions of fact which have not been withdrawn. I  readily  accept
       that the respondent accepted certain  matters  in  this  case  and  I
       regard the judge as having acknowledged this in her  summary  of  the
       reasons for refusal letter. However, matters are not as clear-cut  as
       Mr Chelvan suggested. The reasons for refusal  letter  accepted  that
       the appellant had suffered at the  hands  of  his  family  which  the
       appellant had attributed to his effeminate nature and his  sexuality.
       The  letter  recorded  that  the  appellant's  fear  was   based   on
       repercussions from his  family  because  of  their  unpredictability.
       However, paragraph 47 of the letter stated that the appellant's  fear
       was based in part on speculation and  paragraph  48  noted  that  the
       appellant had continued to live with his family for four years  after
       they discovered his sexuality.

   18. In these circumstances, I consider it was open to the judge to take a
       more nuanced approach. She was entitled, for example, to explore what
       was meant by 'effeminate', albeit I  recognised  this  was  far  from
       easy. By concluding that, whatever was meant by the appellant  having
       an effeminate presentation, this was not particularly  pronounced  in
       this case. She was entitled to reason that the  appellant's  evidence
       that he used to seek sanctuary in the mosque did not sit easily  with
       the claim that his presentation as an effeminate person was such that
       it would place him at risk. She was also entitled  to  note,  as  the
       respondent had done, the length of time the appellant remained living
       with his family and the fact they continue to support him abroad. His
       evidence suggested the parents were abusive towards all the  children
       so it was not simply a case of singly out the appellant. Finally, the
       judge was entitled to note the socio-economic position  held  by  the
       family and the relatively unremarkable nature of  the  two  incidents
       outside the home  environment  described  by  the  appellant  in  his
       evidence and considered by the judge at paragraphs 52 and 53  of  her
       decision.

   19. Had the judge concluded the appellant was not effeminate and had  not
       been harmed by his family in the past such that  there  could  be  no
       risk from them the future, she would undoubtedly have erred by  going
       behind the concessions made by the respondent. However, all the judge
       did in this case was to make findings  on  the  relevant  matters  in
       order to establish the degree of  risk  which,  she  concluded,  fell
       below the relevant threshold. In any event, she considered matters at
       their highest and went on to give reasons  why  the  appellant  could
       exercise internal flight.

   20. The judge drew matters together at paragraph 56 of her decision:

           "56.   The skeleton argument refers to paragraph  168[2]  of  OO
           (Algeria)  asserting  that   the   appellant's   case   can   be
           distinguished from the country guidance  as  the  discrimination
           the appellant is likely to experience is far more grievous  than
           listed at paragraph 168.  However,  I  consider  that  there  is
           nothing in the appellant's evidence that suggests  he  had  been
           persecuted even though he claims to  have  always  presented  as
           effeminate in Algeria. [Past] persecution can be considered good
           evidence of future persecution. Whatever treatment the appellant
           was subjected to before he left Algeria is likely to be the same
           [as] he would face on return. He  has  never  suffered  physical
           violence outside the claims he makes against his family. He  was
           23 when he left Algeria and, in that time, although he claims to
           have presented as effeminate from an early age, he did not  face
           discriminatory measures such as socio-economic discrimination in
           school, in work or in accessing social  services,  unemployment,
           lack  of  access  to  health  services   or   lack   of   career
           opportunities. He is educated and  he  suggests  he  has  had  a
           superior education including his fluency in French. There is  no
           evidence of discrimination other than name-calling which he says
           he has also experienced in the UK. The claim that the  appellant
           will face the full brunt of discrimination and faces persecution
           I do not consider to be realistically well-founded."

   21. This paragraph makes it abundantly clear that the judge proceeded  on
       the basis the appellant had received abuse at the hands of his family
       but not outside the home. The two examples he gave of instances  away
       from  the  family  environment  were  not  persecutory.  The  judge's
       approach mirrors that of  the  respondent  which  was  to  go  on  to
       consider the possibility of the appellant safely relocating away from
       Algiers.

Ground 2

   22. This was the ground on which permission to appeal was granted by  the
       First-tier Tribunal. To understand the ground, it is necessary to set
       out paragraph 57 of the judge's decision:

           "[Counsel for the appellant[3]] did not refer to the  report  of
           Prof Joffï¿½. I do not consider that it takes matters further than
           the reports that were before the Upper Tribunal in OO (Algeria).
           Many of the references predate the country guidance and  contain
           a great deal  of  opinion  little  of  which  is  sourced.  Such
           background evidence as there  is  mainly  predates  the  country
           guidance.  In  considering  the  situation  facing  return   for
           homosexuals he  quotes  the  Algeria  country  report  2004,  an
           incident in May 2005 and refers  to  FIS  and  GIA  and  suicide
           bombings in 2006 and 2007. I do not find  it  of  assistance  in
           evidencing the appellant would face persecution  in  Algeria  on
           account of his sexuality."

   23. The first point to make is that the  grounds  seeking  permission  to
       appeal point out that counsel did provide a skeleton argument to  the
       First-tier Tribunal which made reference to the report  of  Professor
       Joffï¿½. However, my reading of the decision is that, in paragraph  57,
       the judge was simply referring to the oral submissions made  to  her.
       That is because, at paragraph 37,  she  specifically  refers  to  the
       skeleton  argument  submitted  by  counsel  which  argued  that   the
       appellant's case was to be distinguished from the  country  guidance.
       The basis for that submission was that the appellant did not have the
       option of living discreetly because of his effeminate presentation.

   24. I do not consider it  has  been  shown  the  judge  erred  by  simply
       ignoring the report. However, the ground took a further  point  about
       the apparent failure of the judge to have regard to Professor Joffï¿½'s
       report. The error was material because the country guidance  case  of
       OO (Algeria) did not address the  argument  that  the  discrimination
       towards gay men in Algeria amounts to persecution. This was a  lacuna
       in the law. The argument ran as follows.

   25. It was conceded on behalf of the Secretary of State in OO  (Sudan)  v
       SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 1432 that a sufficiently  serious  violation  of
       Article 8 rights might amount to  persecution  for  the  purposes  of
       Article 9(1)(b) of the Qualification Directive. It had been shown  in
       the report of Professor Joffï¿½ that the appellant would  be  subjected
       to discriminatory  measures  including  a  lack  of  effective  legal
       protection, police hostility and social marginalisation. The skeleton
       argument which had been before the judge referred to the respondent's
       API on sexual orientation issues in the asylum claim, of August 2016,
       in which it was accepted that discrimination  may  also  represent  a
       form of harm. I note that there was  a  lengthy  citation  from  this
       document in the skeleton argument, although a full copy is not in the
       file.

   26. Mr Chelvan argued there was a clear error of law on the part  of  the
       judge in failing to decide the issue in the light  of  the  materials
       before her.

   27. Mr Kotas argued it  was  inconceivable  that  the  judge  could  have
       reached a conclusion justifying  a  departure  to  be  made  from  OO
       (Algeria). The argument about Article 9(1)(b)  of  the  Qualification
       Directive was a refined and technical point which had not been  taken
       by counsel at the hearing in the  First-tier  Tribunal.  Furthermore,
       the Court of Appeal held in LC (Albania) v SSHD &  Anor  [2017]  EWCA
       Civ 351  that  the  definition  of  'refugee'  in  the  Qualification
       Directive is materially the same as that in the Geneva Convention  on
       which the Directive is based. On the evidence,  it  was  fanciful  to
       suggest that the appellant could have succeeded on this ground.

   28. In reply, Mr Chelvan said that the guidance of the Court of Appeal in
       LC (Albania) was in the context of consideration of the final conduct
       limb considered in HJ (Iran) and HT (Cameroon)  v  SSHD  [2010]  UKSC
       31[4], not the second limb which was relevant to  these  proceedings:
       whether an openly gay man had a well-founded fear of persecution. The
       report of Professor Joffï¿½ addressed discrimination  as  a  matter  of
       persecution and this was relied on in the skeleton argument  provided
       to the judge. The assessment made by the judge was inadequate.

   29. In order to assess this ground,  it  is  necessary  to  look  at  the
       skeleton argument which was before  the  judge  and  also  report  of
       Professor Joffï¿½. It is clear from the skeleton  argument,  I  accept,
       that a great deal of emphasis was placed on the argument  that  there
       was good  reason  to  distinguish  this  appeal  from  OO  (Algeria).
       Reference was made to paragraph 168 of that case and  the  conclusion
       of the Upper Tribunal that the types  of  discrimination  experienced
       did not amount to persecution. It was argued that the  discrimination
       which this appellant would experience would  be  far  more  grievous.
       Reference is made to the API and the types  of  discrimination  which
       may  also  represent  a  form  of  harm,  such   as,   socio-economic
       discrimination in school,  work  or  in  accessing  social  services,
       unemployment, lack of access  to  health  services,  lack  of  career
       opportunities and exclusion from family support  such  as  rights  to
       inherit.

   30. The report of Professor Joffï¿½ contains three  pages  devoted  to  the
       subject of Islamist attitudes and the  skeleton  argument  highlights
       two of the paragraphs from those pages (37 and 38). There follows two
       pages devoted to popular attitudes towards LGBT  people  and  then  a
       section on the situation facing returned LGBT  people  from  which  a
       further paragraph is highlighted in the skeleton argument (52).  This
       refers to a Dutch report issued in January  2003  which  stated  that
       people  who  openly  admitted  their  LGBT  nature  could  experience
       bullying and intimidation by their social environment or  members  of
       the security forces.

   31. It is right to say that the judge was not expressly asked to consider
       the ambit of Article 9(1)(b),  which  was  not  referred  to  in  the
       skeleton argument, but I accept that she was asked to find  that  the
       discrimination which the appellant would face would be so serious  as
       to engage the Refugee Convention.

   32. In my judgement, the judge did consider  the  issue  fully  and  made
       findings she was entitled to make on the evidence available to her. I
       have already set out paragraph 56  of  her  decision  above  (see  my
       paragraph 20). I agree with Mr Kotas that the judge did  specifically
       consider the types of discrimination described in counsel's  skeleton
       argument. Having done so, she found as fact that the appellant  would
       not face what she described as "the  full  brunt  of  discrimination"
       such as to amount to persecution.

   33. Moreover, in paragraph 57 of her decision, the judge  considered  the
       report of Professor Joffï¿½. With respect to the three paragraphs which
       were drawn to her specific attention in the  skeleton  argument,  she
       was right to point out that the sources  were  somewhat  elderly.  As
       such, they predated the country guidance decision from which she  was
       being asked to depart. This evidence could not support  a  submission
       seeking to justify a departure from country guidance.

   34. I have already pointed out above  that  the  judge  was  entitled  to
       regard the evidence of the appellant's effeminate appearance was  not
       such as to enhance the risk to him to a serious degree.

   35. I find that the judge did not make a material error of  law  on  this
       ground.

The 'Robinson-obvious' point[5]

   36. In opening his submissions, Mr Chelvan sought to rely on a point  not
       previously raised in the grounds  seeking  permission  to  appeal  to
       either the First-tier Tribunal  or  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.  It  is
       convenient to deal with this argument at this point because  it  also
       relates to the judge's assessment of Professor Joffï¿½'s report.

   37. In paragraphs 24  and  25  of  Professor  Joffï¿½'s  report  there  are
       passages  from  the  US  State  Department  report  on  human  rights
       practices in Algeria for 2017 which  referred  to  reports  of  LGBTI
       people being arbitrarily detained and physically and sexually  abused
       by police officers. This was important because it  was  found  in  OO
       (Algeria) that this was not the case. I note that the panel  in  that
       case considered that there was no reliable  evidence  supporting  the
       opinion, for example of Dr Seddon, that there  was  evidence  in  the
       public domain of police brutality towards LGBT people (see  paragraph
       30). The panel was  similarly  unimpressed  by  the  evidence  of  Ms
       Pargeter  concerning  the  large  number  of  arrests  in  2011  (see
       paragraph 71).

   38.  The  respondent's  CPIN  Algeria:  Sexual  orientation  and   gender
       identity, of 22  September  2017,  was  included  in  the  bundle  of
       documents provided to the judge in  the  First  Tier  Tribunal.  This
       stated at paragraph 2.3.7 that there have been a few reports of  LGBT
       people being detained for 'immoral behaviour' and experiencing police
       harassment. However, prosecutions are extremely  rare.  At  paragraph
       5.2 the CPIN refers to the 2016 US State Department report under  the
       heading of ill-treatment by the authorities but there is no reference
       there to arbitrary detention or physical and sexual abuse  by  police
       officers. Mr Chelvan provided me with a complete copy of the US State
       Department report for 2017, although this had  not  been  before  the
       judge in the First-tier Tribunal.

   39. Mr Chelvan argued that there was clear and cogent evidence before the
       judge of state persecution and her  failure  to  consider  it  was  a
       'Robinson-obvious' point which should be  considered  notwithstanding
       the fact it had not previously been pleaded. It  was  clear,  in  his
       submission, that OO (Algeria) should  not  have  been  followed.  The
       evidence of the US State Department report was sufficient to  satisfy
       the objective test elaborated in paragraph 82 of HJ  (Iran),  namely,
       whether gay people who live openly would be liable to persecution  in
       the country of nationality.

   40. Mr Kotas accepted the evidence came from a reliable source  and  that
       it post-dated OO (Algeria).  However,  he  argued  that  it  did  not
       justify a departure from country guidance. He reminded  me  that  the
       test was whether there were very strong grounds supported  by  cogent
       evidence justifying departure from country guidance (see SG (Iraq)  v
       SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 940, paragraph 47).

   41. The judge was bound to follow Practice Direction 12.2 which states:

           "A reported determination of the Tribunal, the AIT  or  the  IAT
           bearing the letters "CG" shall be treated  as  an  authoritative
           finding  on  the  country  guidance  issue  identified  in   the
           determination, based upon the evidence before the members of the
           Tribunal, the AIT or the IAT that determine  the  appeal.  As  a
           result, unless it has been expressly superseded or  replaced  by
           any later "CG" determination,  or  is  inconsistent  with  other
           authority that is  binding  on  the  Tribunal,  such  a  country
           guidance case is authoritative in any subsequent appeal, so  far
           as that appeal: (a) relates to the  country  guidance  issue  in
           question; and (b) depends upon the same or similar evidence."

   42. The passage Mr Kotas referred me to  from  the  judgment  of  Stanley
       Burnton LJ in SG (Iraq), with whom Gross and Maurice Kay LJJ  agreed,
       states as follows,

           "It is for  these  reasons,  as  well  as  the  desirability  of
           consistency,  that  decision  makers  and  tribunal  judges  are
           required to take Country Guidance determinations  into  account,
           and to follow them  unless  very  strong  grounds  supported  by
           cogent evidence, are adduced justifying their not doing so."

   43. I do not consider the report of Professor Joffï¿½  provided  the  judge
       with "very strong grounds" supported by  cogent  evidence  to  depart
       from OO (Algeria). My reasons are as follows.

   44. Firstly, the point about  the  actions  of  the  police  in  directly
       persecuting LGBT people was not taken by counsel at the  hearing.  It
       is not referred to in his skeleton argument or in the judge's summary
       of his closing submissions. The case was put in an entirely different
       way. The particular paragraphs from Professor Joffï¿½'s report were not
       highlighted in the First-tier Tribunal. As already noted, counsel did
       not refer to the report at all in his closing submissions.

   45. Secondly, under such circumstances, I do not consider the judge erred
       by failing to spot the point  herself.  It  was  not  a  sufficiently
       obvious point to have found its way into any of the  grounds  seeking
       permission to appeal. The US State Department report was not  in  the
       bundle of evidence submitted by the appellant's  solicitors.  It  was
       not provided to the judge. All she had were two brief extracts in the
       report of Professor Joffï¿½. She was undoubtedly entitled  to  consider
       that the report, on the whole, suffered from a lack  of  up  to  date
       references.

   46. Thirdly, even if the  report  had  been  before  the  judge  and  the
       relevant passages highlighted, it remains very doubtful that it could
       have materially affected the outcome. As  seen,  there  was  evidence
       before the panel in OO (Algeria) suggesting instances  of  harassment
       and ill-treatment of LGBT people by the police.  The  panel  did  not
       find the evidence of the two  experts  mentioned  persuasive  because
       they found no evidence supporting their assertions. It is clear  that
       to displace the findings of the  panel  in  OO  (Algeria)  will  take
       evidence with a degree of cogency beyond what is found  in  Professor
       Joffï¿½'s report. He simply quotes from the US State Department  report
       without providing any concrete examples. He adds nothing  to  it  and
       makes no further reference to the issue in his conclusions about  the
       risks to this appellant.

   47. If the reports contained in the US State Department are  correct  and
       there is evidence from primary sources to support  them,  then  there
       might well be a  need  to  revisit  the  findings  in  OO  (Algeria).
       However, that evidence was not before the judge in this case  and  is
       not apparent now. In my judgement, the judge did not  materially  err
       by failing to consider it.

Ground 3

   48. This ground argues the judge erred in her approach to  the  issue  of
       internal flight. She found, in paragraph 64, that the appellant could
       "relocate to another city away from Algiers". Mr Chelvan  argued  the
       judge  erred  by  failing  to  identify  an  alternative   place   of
       relocation. Article 8(2) of the Qualification Directive states[6]:

           "In examining whether a part of the  country  of  origin  is  in
           accordance with paragraph 1, Member States shall at the time  of
           taking the decision  on  the  application  have  regard  to  the
           general circumstances prevailing in that part of the country and
           to the personal circumstances of the applicant."

   49.  I  note  that  this  is  reflected  in  paragraph  339O(ii)  of  the
       Immigration Rules[7].

   50. Mr Chelvan sought to cite an unreported decision of this tribunal  to
       support the argument that the judge should have done  more.   He  has
       certified that the proposition is not to be  found  in  any  reported
       decision of the tribunal in accordance with Practice Direction  11.2.
       The case cited is MB  v  SSHD  (PA/04051/20017),  promulgated  on  23
       November 2018.  In that case it was accepted that the appellant was a
       bisexual who had received threats to kill from her father. The  judge
       found the appellant was at risk of serious harm from her  father.  On
       the question of internal flight, the  judge  accepted  the  appellant
       could not return to those parts of Albania where her father and other
       family members lived. The panel found the judge had erred in  law  in
       his approach for the reasons set out as follows:

           "8.    In considering whether it would be unduly harsh  for  the
           appellant  to  relocate,  the  judge  failed  to  indicate   the
           destination he had in mind, an aspect candidly  acknowledged  by
           [the senior presenting officer] in his  submissions.  The  judge
           therefore considered  this  aspect  in  a  vacuum.  He  did  not
           identify which university the appellant  might  attend  all  the
           city where it might be. No reasons  were  given  why  the  judge
           concluded that the  discrimination  and  the  disapproval  which
           might lead the appellant to keep her sexuality secret would  not
           be unduly harsh. The question the judge should have asked,  once
           the destination was  decided  upon,  was  whether  it  would  be
           reasonable for her to live in such a place  that  might  require
           her to keep her sexuality secret from landlords,  employers  and
           friends. This would need to be considered in the context of  her
           mental health in respect of which the judge  was  satisfied  the
           appellant was depressed. We find this failure  to  give  reasons
           sufficient for the decision to be set aside and  for  it  to  be
           remade."

   51. Answering a point relied on by Mr Kotas in his skeleton  argument  to
       the effect that "the evaluative exercise is intended to  be  holistic
       and ... no burden and standard of proof arises"[8], Mr Chelvan argued
       the position was different following the coming  into  force  of  the
       Qualification  Directive.  He  sought  to  distinguish  WF  (Internal
       Relocation - Christian) India CG [2002] UKIAT 04874  on  this  basis,
       although it is not clear to me how the same argument can be made with
       regard to SC (Jamaica).

   52. Mr Kotas pointed out that this was another  example  of  an  argument
       which had not been made to the judge at the hearing in the First-tier
       Tribunal.  The difference  of  approach  demanded,  in  Mr  Chelvan's
       submissions, by the Qualification Directive was not an argument which
       had been made to the judge.  No  authorities  had  been  provided  in
       support.

   53. Mr Kotas pointed out that the respondent had, in  fact,  suggested  a
       place to which the appellant could relocate  safely:  Constantine[9].
       He also argued that, whilst it was clear on the facts of MB  why  the
       judge had erred in not identifying a place the appellant  could  live
       safely, the current appeal was distinguishable. Albania  was  a  tiny
       country and the appellant  had  family  in  a  number  of  locations.
       Algeria is a huge, populous country.

   54. Mr Chelvan argued that the respondent's suggestion of Constantine was
       not a "killer point" because it only referred to it being a place  of
       safety and did not consider, as required by Article 8(2), whether  it
       was reasonable for the appellant to relocate there. In any event, the
       judge had not considered Constantine or anywhere else.

   55. I have found it helpful to consider the guidance of  the  SPT  in  SC
       (Jamaica) on the correct approach to the issue  of  internal  flight.
       This decision was referred to in the case relied on by Mr Chelvan (KS
       (Iran) v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 6).

   56. I see no reason to regard  this  guidance  as  only  appertaining  to
       consideration of the Refugee  Convention.   It  is  plainly  a  post-
       Directive decision. It was  an  appeal  by  the  Secretary  of  State
       against a decision of the Upper Tribunal upholding  the  decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appeal. In finding there was  an
       error of law, the SPT said,

           "29.   A person is a refugee within the meaning of article 1A(2)
           of the Refugee Convention if they are  unable  or  unwilling  to
           avail themselves of the protection of their home  country  owing
           to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of  race,
           religion, nationality, membership of a particular  social  group
           or political opinion. A person is not  a  refugee  if  they  can
           reasonably or without undue harshness be  expected  to  live  in
           another part of their home country where they would not  have  a
           well-founded  fear  of  persecution.  This  is   the   'internal
           relocation' or the 'relocation alternative'.

           30. The leading  House  of  Lords  authority  on  the  issue  of
           internal relocation is  Januzi.   The  question  in  Januzi  was
           whether, in judging reasonableness and undue harshness  in  this
           context, account should be taken of any  disparity  between  the
           civil, political  and  socio-economic  human  rights  which  the
           person would enjoy in the place of relocation and the  place  of
           asylum. The House of Lords was of the  opinion  that  it  should
           not. Lord Hope held at [45] that:

                "... I too would hold that the question whether it would  be
                unduly harsh for a claimant to be  expected  to  live  in  a
                place of relocation within the country of his nationality is
                not to be judged by considering whether the quality of  life
                in the place of relocation meets the basic norms  of  civil,
                political and socio-economic human rights."

           31.    The House of Lords also gave guidance on the approach  to
           reasonableness and undue harshness. Lord Bingham  held  at  [21]
           that:

                "The  decision-maker,  taking  account   of   all   relevant
                circumstances pertaining to the claimant and his country  of
                origin, must decide whether it is reasonable to  expect  the
                claimant to relocate or whether it would be unduly harsh  to
                expect him to do so."

           32.    Accordingly, undue harshness is to be judged by reference
           to SC's country of nationality and by reference to SC's personal
           circumstances.

           33.    The issue of the reasonableness  of  internal  relocation
           accordingly involves three separate questions:

                1. What is the location to which it is proposed  the  person
                could move?

                2. Are there real risks of serious harm  or  persecution  in
                this place?

                3. If not, is it reasonable or not unduly  harsh  to  expect
                the person to relocate to this place?

           34.    The first question is a factual question and  the  second
           question is an evaluation to be resolved on  the  basis  of  the
           evidence accepted by the tribunal. There is no legal  complexity
           to the questions, although the tribunal should seek  to  express
           its conclusions in a clear way to show that  it  has  considered
           the evidence relevant  to  the  questions.  The  third  question
           involves  a  further  value  judgment  based  on  the   evidence
           accepted.  On its face, paragraph 339O of the Immigration  Rules
           reflects the test laid down by the House of Lords in Januzi  and
           requires  the   decision   maker   to   consider   the   general
           circumstances  prevailing  in  the  country  concerned  and  the
           personal circumstances of the person.

           35.    I regret to have to conclude that the decision of the FtT
           on this question whether as set out in its judgment at  [38]  or
           taking the judgment as a  whole  is  flawed  for  the  following
           reasons. There is no consideration of any part of Jamaica  other
           than Kingston and there is no analysis of whether  the  rest  of
           Jamaica (rural or urban)  is  homogenous  or  differentiated  in
           terms of the risk of serious harm or  persecution  that  exists.
           The FtT relied  upon  SC's  need  for  medical  treatment  as  a
           relevant relocation factor but without conducting an analysis of
           any evidence that  there  might  have  been  about  whether  his
           medical treatment could be continued in any particular  part  of
           Jamaica or, if it is the case, whether medical facilities  there
           are inadequate.  Further, the FtT found that there was a lack of
           employment  opportunities  for   SC   without   any   evidential
           foundation.

           36.    I accept the submission that the evaluative  exercise  is
           intended to be holistic and that no burden or standard of  proof
           arises in relation  to  the  overall  issue  of  whether  it  is
           reasonable to internally relocate (see, for example Sedley LJ in
           Karanakaran v SSHD [2000] EWCA Civ 11 at [15] and  [20]).   That
           is distinct from the question whether there is any evidence upon
           which the evaluations could be made.   This  court  cannot  know
           what evidence, if any, was provided on questions (1) and (2) and
           whether the tribunal accepted  or  rejected  any  part  of  that
           evidence in coming to a value judgment which is accordingly  not
           supported by evidence.  It has not been demonstrated to us  that
           the conclusions of fact are inferences that  could  properly  be
           drawn from materials that were  available.   It  is  accordingly
           wrong to say that there were clear factual findings to which the
           test of reasonableness was applied  or  that  the  tribunal  had
           sufficient factual material to undertake an holistic  assessment
           for the purpose of the third question."

   57. I now turn to the judge's decision in this case. I remind myself that
       she sought to apply OO (Algeria) and that she was  entitled  to  find
       the discriminatory matters  relied  on  by  the  appellant  were  not
       particularly significant. In OO (Algeria) the panel found as follows,

           "180.  As there is no sufficiency of protection  available,  the
           next question is  whether  the  gay  son  whose  family  is  not
           prepared to tolerate him living  as  a  gay  man,  can  relocate
           elsewhere in Algeria to avoid ill-treatment from family  members
           and if so whether it will be reasonable to expect him to do  so.
           If it is not reasonable then, having travelled  to  the  UK,  he
           will be entitled to international protection.

           181.   That question, of whether there is a safe and  reasonable
           internal relocation option, is a difficult and  complex  one  in
           the  Algerian  context.  Generally,  there  will  be   no   real
           difficulty preventing relocation and there is no indication that
           disapproving family members have the means, inclination or reach
           to cause difficulties after relocation. But where such a  person
           has established himself elsewhere in  Algeria,  as  marriage  is
           expected of all Algerian men, in pursuance of what is seen as an
           "Islamic duty to procreate",  it  may  well,  sooner  or  later,
           become apparent that he has not adhered to  the  norms  expected
           and that is likely to generate suspicion that he is a gay man.

           182.   There is no real risk  of  gay  men  being  subjected  to
           violence or other persecutory ill-treatment outside  the  family
           home, either at the hands of the authorities or  by  members  of
           the public with whom gay men have to engage. There is an absence
           of reliable evidence of that occurring.

           183.   Very few gay men live openly  as  such  in  Algeria.  Gay
           Algerian men,  as  a  consequence  of  cultural,  religious  and
           societal views, do not generally  identify  themselves  as  gay,
           even if their sexual preferences lead them to  prefer  same  sex
           relationships. Even Algerian men with settled sexual preferences
           for same sex relationships may well continue to entertain  doubt
           about their sexuality. Second, gay men recognise the intense and
           deep rooted near universal  disapproval  of  homosexuality  that
           obtains in Algeria. Thus, Algerian gay men  who  have  moved  to
           France where, plainly, they face no obstacle to living openly as
           such, generally choose not to because they refuse to  categorise
           themselves  as  gay,  even  though  there  is   no   persecutory
           disincentive to doing so.

           184.   The fact that there is very little evidence  of  gay  men
           living openly in Algeria invites the  conclusion  that  must  be
           because the risk  of  persecutory  ill-treatment  likely  to  be
           attracted is such as to prevent that  from  happening.  But  the
           expert and other country evidence does not  establish  that,  in
           fact, there is any real risk outside the family context of  such
           persecutory ill-treatment being meted out to  persons  suspected
           as being gay. The expert  evidence  indicates  that  a  gay  man
           recognised as such is very likely to attract an adverse response
           from those by whom he is encountered as he goes about his  daily
           business. But that adverse reaction is not reasonably likely  be
           such as to amount to persecution, being on a range of  responses
           from a simple expression of disapproval, mockery or name calling
           up to the possibility of physical attack. But there is simply no
           reliable  evidence  of  the  expression  of  disapproval   being
           expressed in such circumstances generally being  otherwise  than
           at the lower end of that range of responses.

           185.   That gives rise to a conundrum. If there is  no  evidence
           of persecution of gay men who have  escaped  ill-treatment  from
           family by relocating elsewhere, why is there no evidence of  gay
           men feeling able to live openly? Alternatively, is  the  absence
           of evidence of physical ill-treatment of gay men due to the fact
           that there are no gay men living openly?

           186.   The answer, in our judgement, is as follows:

                 a. The only risk of ill-treatment  at  a  level  to  become
                    persecution likely to be encountered by  a  gay  man  in
                    Algeria is at the hands of his own  family,  after  they
                    have discovered that he is gay.  There  is  no  reliable
                    evidence such as to establish that a gay man, identified
                    as such, faces a real risk of persecutory  ill-treatment
                    from persons outside his own family.

                 b. Where a gay man remains living with his family  to  whom
                    he has disclosed his sexual orientation in circumstances
                    where they are prepared to tolerate that,  his  decision
                    to live discreetly  and  to  conceal  his  homosexuality
                    outside  the  family  home  is  not   taken   to   avoid
                    persecution but  to  avoid  shame  or  disrespect  being
                    brought upon his family. That means that he  has  chosen
                    to live discreetly, not to  avoid  persecution  but  for
                    reasons  that  do  not  give  rise   to   a   right   to
                    international protection.

                 c. Where a gay man has to flee his  family  home  to  avoid
                    persecution  from  family  members,  in  his  place   of
                    relocation he will attract no real risk  of  persecution
                    because, generally, he will not live  openly  as  a  gay
                    man. As the evidence does not  establish  that  he  will
                    face  a  real  risk  of  persecution   if   subsequently
                    suspected  to  be  a  gay  man,  his  decision  to  live
                    discreetly and to  conceal  his  sexual  orientation  is
                    driven by respect for social mores and a desire to avoid
                    attracting disapproval of a type that falls  well  below
                    the threshold of persecution. Quite apart from that,  an
                    Algerian man who has a settled preference for  same  sex
                    relationships may well continue to entertain  doubts  as
                    to his sexuality and not to regard himself as a gay man,
                    in any event.

           187.    Underpinning  these  conclusions  is  recognition   that
           Algerian society is governed by strict Islamic values which  all
           citizens, including gay men, in practice respect, even  if  only
           for pragmatic reasons.

           188.   This gives rise to a compromise which in some  senses  is
           unsatisfactory but, as a matter of law, does not give rise to  a
           right to be recognised as a refugee. Algerian society, including
           the   state   authorities,   effectively    tolerates    private
           manifestations  of  homosexual  conduct,  both   between   young
           unmarried men and gay men who have established  themselves  away
           from the family home, provided there is no public display of it.
           Gay men choose to live  discreetly  not  to  avoid  persecution,
           because there is no evidence that there is any, but because they
           recognise that the society they live in is a  conservative  one,
           subject to strict Islamic  values,  that  is  unable  to  openly
           embrace the existence of the practice of homosexuality, just  as
           women are expected to submit to  Islamic  requirements  such  as
           being veiled and accepting other limitations upon their  ability
           to act as they may wish to.

           189.   The evidence before us indicates  that  as  a  result  of
           societal views and conditioning, Algerian men with a  preference
           for same-sex relationships  generally  do  not  in  fact  regard
           themselves as  gay  men  and  so  have  no  reason  to  identify
           themselves as such to  others  by  conducting  themselves  in  a
           manner that has come  to  be  regarded  as  "living  openly"  or
           discreetly. Therefore, choosing not to live openly as gay men is
           not due to a fear of persecution but other reasons  to  do  with
           self-perception and how they wish to be perceived by others.

           190.   For these  reasons,  a  gay  man  from  Algeria  will  be
           entitled to be recognised as a refugee only if  he  shows  that,
           due to his personal circumstances, it would be unreasonable  and
           unduly harsh to expect him to relocate within Algeria  to  avoid
           persecution from family members, or because  he  has  particular
           characteristics that might, unusually and contrary  to  what  is
           generally to be expected, give rise  to  a  risk  of  attracting
           disapproval at the  highest  level  of  the  possible  range  of
           adverse  responses  from  those   seeking   to   express   their
           disapproval of the fact of his sexual orientation."

   58. It is correct the judge in this case  did  not  identify  a  specific
       place the appellant could relocate to and she  did  not  address  the
       possibility of the appellant living in Constantine. Instead she found
       the appellant could relocate to any city other than Algiers.

   59. I agree with Mr Kotas that the context is  extremely  important.  The
       appellant had only related his fears of his family to Algiers.  There
       was no cogent evidence that the family would  pursue  the  appellant.
       Far from it. Nor was there cogent evidence  that  the  appellant  had
       encountered very serious problems away from  his  family.  The  judge
       found the appellant would face societal discrimination but not  at  a
       level ("full brunt") to be  regarded  as  persecution.  As  discussed
       above, she found that, although effeminate,  the  appellant  was  not
       particularly so.

   60. In reaching her  conclusions  on  internal  flight,  the  judge  took
       account of the appellant's personal characteristics. She pointed  out
       he is educated to degree level and  has  work  experience  as  a  lab
       assistant, in a restaurant  and  in  IT.  He  has  also  gained  work
       experience in the UK.  He  speaks  English  fluently.  As  said,  she
       discusses  the  contradictions  in  the  appellant's  evidence  about
       contact with and financial support from  his  family  in  any  event.
       There were no significant health issues. The appellant had been  able
       to access healthcare in the past.

   61. In my judgement, the judge did not fall into the same error as in  MB
       of making her finding on internal  flight  "in  a  vacuum".   In  the
       context of the Albanian case, it was clearly vital to show that there
       would in reality be a place where the appellant would be safe because
       her family would not find her  and  where  she  could  reasonably  be
       expected to relocate. In the context of a small country like Albania,
       the appellant was left in doubt about where it was the judge believed
       she could return to and where she could study at university level and
       find shop work. The reasonableness of relocation could  not  properly
       be assessed absent such an indication from the judge.

   62. No such concerns arise in this case,  in  which  the  judge  had  the
       benefit of country guidance on the point. In effect, she  found  that
       Algeria would be safe anywhere apart from the appellant's home  area.
       The appellant could reasonably be expected to relocate to  any  urban
       district which was not in the Algiers area. In the circumstances, the
       judge did not materially err by  not  going  further  and  indicating
       which  particular  city  or  cities  she  had  in  mind  because  the
       conditions were, for the purposes of the particular appeal, the  same
       in all of them.

   63. I do not find that ground 3 shows the judge materially erred in law.

Ground 4

   64. This ground relates to the judge's consideration  of  Article  8.  In
       short, it is argued the judge failed to apply  the  correct  approach
       which was first to consider  Article  8  through  the  prism  of  the
       Immigration Rules[10] and then outside the  rules.  The  ground  also
       flags up the overlap with ground 2, the discrimination point, and the
       "flagrant denial or gross violation" point raised but not decided  in
       Ullah, R (on the Application of) v Special  Adjudicator  [2004]  UKHL
       26, [2004] 2 AC 323[11]. Mr Chelvan said this was an important lacuna
       in the law waiting to be filled.

   65. Mr Kotas argued that there was  no  material  error  in  the  judge's
       decision and he cited the guidance provided on the meaning  of  "very
       significant obstacles" by the Court of Appeal in SSHD  v  AK  (Sierra
       Leone) [2016] EWCA Civ 813.  Sales  LJ  said  at  paragraph  [14]  as
       follows:

           "In my view, the concept of a foreign  criminal's  "integration"
           into the country to which it is proposed that he be deported, as
           set out in section 117C(4)(c) and paragraph  399A,  is  a  broad
           one. It is not confined to the mere ability to find a job or  to
           sustain life while living  in  the  other  country.  It  is  not
           appropriate to treat the statutory language as subject  to  some
           gloss and it will usually be sufficient for a court or  tribunal
           simply to direct itself in the terms that Parliament has  chosen
           to use. The idea of "integration" calls for a  broad  evaluative
           judgment to be made as to whether the individual will be  enough
           of an insider in terms of understanding how life in the  society
           in  that  other  country  is  carried  on  and  a  capacity   to
           participate in it, so as to have a reasonable opportunity to  be
           accepted there, to be able to operate on a day-to-day  basis  in
           that society and to build up within a reasonable time a  variety
           of human relationships to give  substance  to  the  individual's
           private or family life."

   66. Mr Kotas also argued the case had not been  made  in  the  First-tier
       Tribunal in the same way now being put forward. I note Article 8  was
       raised in the notice of appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  albeit
       without being developed. Article  8  was  not  mentioned  at  all  in
       counsel's skeleton argument and  there  is  nothing  in  the  judge's
       decision to show she received any submissions on it.

   67. In that context, the judge dealt with Article 8  as  follows  in  her
       decision:

           "65.   It is claimed that returning  the  appellant  to  Algeria
           would breach his right to respect for private  life.  I  do  not
           accept that is the case either in the context of the Immigration
           Rules or outside the Immigration Rules under Article 8 ECHR. The
           appellant entered the UK with a short-term visa as a student and
           in his interview said that [he] intended to return to Algeria or
           go to France. He has no family in the UK and says that he  is  a
           loner. He lived in Algeria the majority of his life.  He  worked
           there and, in the UK, has been helping fellow Algerians. He  was
           visited by his sister in 2015. He therefore  can  reasonably  be
           expected to have remained familiar with the culture and customs.
           Whilst the appellant may encounter some discrimination by way of
           name-calling  and  insults,  there  are  no   very   significant
           obstacles to him returning to Algeria and there is  no  evidence
           of any exceptional circumstances why he should not  be  expected
           to return there. He should be able to gain employment to support
           himself.

           66.     The  appellant  said  that  he  suffers   from   medical
           conditions however he has not filed any supporting evidence.  He
           was able to obtain treatment in Algeria  including  surgery  and
           there is no evidence  that  he  would  not  be  able  to  access
           healthcare in the future. I also have regard to section 117B  of
           the Immigration, Nationality and Asylum Act 2002, as amended  by
           the Immigration Act 2014. Immigration control is in  the  public
           interest. The appellant entered the UK  as  a  student  and  has
           overstayed for most of the time  he  has  been  in  the  UK.  He
           delayed applying for asylum though he claims that it was because
           of the treatment to which he was  subject  in  Algiers  that  he
           chose  to  leave.  Any  private  life  established  was  in  the
           knowledge that his status [in] the UK was precarious it was  not
           unreasonable nor would the Secretary of State be  in  breach  of
           his obligations to the appellant under Article  8  ECHR  are  in
           removing him to his home country."

   68. I have to say that I am at a loss to understand how it can be said to
       be the case that the judge erred by failing  to  consider  the  claim
       both inside and outside the rules. That is plainly what she has done.



   69. I see no error in the manner in which the judge assessed the  Article
       8 claim, such as it was. She expressly considered the sort of factors
       discussed in AK (Sierra Leone) as being relevant and  she  reached  a
       sustainable conclusion on the facts found. Going  beyond  the  rules,
       she found there were no exceptional circumstances to warrant a  grant
       of leave. In doing so she was obliged  to  apply  section  117B  when
       assessing the public interest in removal.

   70. The argument which Mr Chelvan  is  anxious  to  raise  regarding  the
       applicability of Ullah to the circumstances of a gay man  in  Algeria
       was simply not argued in the First-tier Tribunal and  the  judge  did
       not err in failing to consider it. She did revisit her  consideration
       of the discrimination which the appellant  would  face,  albeit  only
       within her consideration of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the rules.  On
       the facts as found by her, the case could not have succeeded  on  the
       basis of the interference with the appellant's  ability  to  enjoy  a
       private life in Algeria. She was entitled to find he would be able to
       build a private life and that the discrimination he  would  encounter
       would not significantly impede his enjoyment of the right.

   71. I find no error in relation to ground 4.

NOTICE OF DECISION

  The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal did not make a material error of law
  and her decision dismissing the appeal shall stand.

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Froom
-----------------------

[1] "1.  Acts of persecution within the  meaning  of  article  1 A  of  the
Geneva Convention must:

   (a)   be sufficiently serious  by  their  nature  or  repetition  as  to
   constitute a severe violation of basic human rights, in  particular  the
   rights from which derogation cannot be made under Article 15(2) of  the
   European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights  and  Fundamental
   Freedoms; or

   (b)   be an accumulation of various measures,  including  violations  of
   human rights which is sufficiently severe as to affect an individual  in
   a similar manner as mentioned in (a)."

[2] "The absence of reliable  evidence  of  adverse  reactions  to  gay  men
living  away  from  their  families  of  a  type  sufficiently  serious   to
constitute persecutory ill-treatment demonstrates that the  choice  to  live
discreetly as a gay  man  is  not  generally  driven  by  a  need  to  avoid
persecution. In living in a manner  that  does  not  require  others  to  be
confronted with open displays of the affection a gay couple  have  for  each
other such  a  couple  are  doing  no  more  than  what  is  demanded  of  a
heterosexual couple. That two gay men do not volunteer the information  that
they are living together not simply sharing  accommodation  as  friends  but
living together as sexual partners, gay men are acting discreetly  to  avoid
social pressures of the type contemplated in HJ (Iran) v SSHD that does  not
give rise to a sustainable claim for asylum. Put another way, a gay man  who
did live openly as such in Algeria  may  well  attract  upsetting  comments;
find his relationships with friends or work colleagues  damaged;  or  suffer
other  discriminatory  repercussions  such  as  experiencing  difficulty  in
dealing with some suppliers  or  services.  But  none  of  that  amounts  to
persecution."
