                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     The sponsor Mr Hussain appeared for his wife
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis,   Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for the Home  Department
       (hereinafter referred to as the respondent) against a  determination
       of FTTJ S.J. Pacey promulgated on 17 April 2014 in which she allowed
       the  appeal  of  Zobia  Iqbal   (hereinafter  referred  to  as   the
       appellant) against refusal of entry clearance as the spouse  of  the
       sponsor.


    2. On 20 May 2014 FTTJ Clayton found that

       "  It  was  accepted  that  the  appellant  could  not  fulfil   the
       requirements of Appendix FM. The appeal fell to be  dismissed  under
       the Immigration Rules.
       Gulshan [2013] UKUT 000640 (IAC) states that an Article 8 assessment
       should only be carried out where there were compelling circumstances
       not recognised by the Rules. Gulshan further states that  an  appeal
       should only be allowed where there were  exceptional  circumstances.
       Nagre v SSHD [2013] EWHC  720  endorsed  the  Secretary  of  State's
       guidance on the meaning of exceptional circumstances that  is  where
       refusal would lead to an unjustifiably harsh outcome.
       The judge accepted that neither the  appellant  nor  respondent  had
       contended there were "insurmountable obstacles" and found  no  leave
       ought to be granted outside the Rules on the  basis  of  exceptional
       circumstances. He contradicted his findings by taking  into  account
       evidence of the sponsor's income which was not before  the  ECO  and
       stating that a variety of factors  made  the  respondent's  decision
       disproportionate and irrational under the law relating  to  refugees
       and the constitutional rights of British citizens. I find  that  the
       judge arguably misdirected himself. There is therefore  an  arguable
       error of law"

    3. Thus the matter came before me.  The appellant was unrepresented but
       her husband the sponsor attended. He had with him further pay  slips
       as evidence of his employment. He had not thought to bring his  bank
       statements with  him.   As  someone  without  the  assistance  of  a
       solicitor he had no legal submissions to make  in  response  to  the
       grounds seeking permission to appeal.


    4.  Mr  Jarvis  submitted  that  the  Secretary  of  State's  complaint
       concerned the approach  of  the  FTTJ  outside  of  the  Rules.  The
       application failed under the Rules,  Appendix FM read with  Appendix
       FM-SE because the appellant did not file with  her  application  the
       specified evidence in this case the sponsor's bank statements.  Even
       at this hearing the sponsor has still not provided the relevant  pay
       slips to corroborate payslips as required by Immigration Rules.  The
       Rules identify a six month period back from date of  application  in
       entry  clearance  cases.  The  Rules,  unlike  points   based   visa
       applications, do not prohibit someone providing evidence  from  that
       period at their appeal hearing. This was not done before  the  FTTJ.
       In paragraph 7 of the  determination  the  FTTJ  goes  on  to  apply
       Gulshan [2013] UKUT 000640 (IAC) but is wrong  in  her  application.
       Furthermore  the  FTTJ  hasn't  understood  the  Rules.  The   entry
       clearance requirements for entry clearance as a spouse if not met on
       account  of  the  income  requirements  of  the  Immigration   Rules
       (maintenance and accommodation)  do  not  lead  to  EX.1.  The  FTTJ
       mistakenly misses the point that for an entry clearance case EX.1 is
       not applicable. The appellant is not someone who  is  being  removed
       but is a person who can make another application.


    5. The FTTJ found that there were no exceptional circumstances  and  no
       insurmountable obstacles and in terms of how the law  is  structured
       that should have been the end of the  appeal.   But  the  FTTJ  then
       erred in law and went on to a third stage to allow the appeal on the
       basis of evidence heard by  her  that  the  appellant  now  met  the
       requirements of the rules. She came  to  this  conclusion  from  the
       sponsor's payslips  and  overlooked  the  requirements  set  out  in
       Appendix FM-SE for bank statements to have been filed  corroborating
       the income claimed to have been earned. There are only two steps  to
       be considered. The first is Appendix FM. Only if FM is not  met  and
       there are compelling circumstances should an FTTJ go  on  to  assess
       the appeal outside of the Rules.


    6. Cases like Gulshan [2013] UKUT 000640 (IAC) show those terms such as
       exceptional or unjustifiably harsh  are  compliant  with  Article  8
       jurisprudence. In MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ  1192  the  Court  of
       Appeal said Secretary of State's position on what exceptional  meant
       was lawful and compliant with Article  8 jurisprudence.

    7.  The  FTTJ,  in  having  established  third  level  of  enquiry  has
       misunderstood the nature of rules and language of rules.  The  judge
       also speculated about the future saying what  would  happen  if  the
       appellant made a fresh application. But binding authority  including
       SB (Bangladesh) says it is unlawful  for  judge  to  speculate  what
       might happen in an EC application.

    8. Mr Jarvis's final point was that  the  FTTJ  judge  centred  on  and
       misunderstood MM [2013] EWHC 1900. MM was an  in-country case  where
       the  consequences of separation by removal were looked at  by  Blake
       J.  This is not comparable with an entry clearance  case  where  the
       appellant can make a fresh application showing compliance  with  the
       Immigration Rules. This is a case in which parties  could  not  show
       required level of maintenance  because  they  did  not  provide  the
       evidence the rules  required  either  with  application  or  at  the
       hearing. The appeal should  not  have  been  allowed  on  Article  8
       grounds outside  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  The  remedy  for  the
       appellant was to make a fresh application  properly  supported  with
       evidence as to the income requirements of the Immigration Rules.

    Decision

    9. The appellant could not succeed under the Immigration Rules  because
       she had not supplied with her  application  the  required  specified
       evidence (bank statements) to demonstrate that her sponsor earned  a
       sum equivalent to or in excess of the income  threshold  of  ï¿½18,600
       set by the Immigration Rules. This sum was not struck down by  Blake
       J in  MM [2013] EWHA 1900 who found that it was not  appropriate  to
       strike down the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules. The
       FTTJ correctly dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.


   10. The FTTJ allowed the appeal on  human  rights  grounds.  Before  she
       found for the appellant she found that there was  no  contention  on
       behalf of the appellant that there were any insurmountable obstacles
       and she said there was no evidence before her  to  show  that  leave
       should be granted outside of the Immigration Rules on the  basis  of
       exceptional circumstances. In  coming  to  these  findings  she  was
       correct.


   11.   It is clear from paragraph 8 of her determination  that  the  FTTJ
       considered   the  reference  to  the  Migration  Advisory  Committee
       referred to in paragraph 124 of MM. Blake J found at paragraph 140:

        "In  my  judgment,  the  aim  of  transparency  cannot  justify  an
        agglomeration of measures that cumulatively very severely  restrict
        the ability of many law abiding and decent citizens of this  nation
        who happen not to earn substantial incomes in their employment from
        living with  their  spouses  in  the  land  of  their  nationality.
        Transparency can be best achieved by clarity as  to  the  kinds  of
        documents required to demonstrate the relevant facts rather than  a
        blanket rule preventing receipt of data that may well be sufficient
        and reliable.  The most obvious way of proving the earning capacity
        of the spouse is a job offer.  In the past one problem has been the
        timing  of  the  offer  with  respect  to  the  processing  of  the
        application, but there is no reason why historic failure to process
        applications speedily should frustrate the ability of a  couple  to
        live together;  again  in  my  judgment  the  answer  lies  in  the
        discharge of the burden of proof and not an  unnecessarily  austere
        exclusionary rule.  Here again  checks after twelve months may well
        be proportionate and informative as that would afford a  reasonable
        opportunity for the spouse with skills to have  attended  selection
        interviews and demonstrated requisite skills".


   12. In the appeal before  the  FTTJ  this  was  not  a  case  where  the
       appellant was saying that the Immigration  Rules  set  too  high  an
       income threshold for her and the sponsor to meet. Her case was  that
       they met the income  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  The
       appellant was required to provide specified evidence in the form  of
       bank statements to confirm the sponsor's earnings. She failed to  do
       so. There was no evidence of exceptional  circumstances  before  the
       Judge from which she  could  reasonably  find  the  appeal  required
       consideration outside of the  Immigration  Rules.  In  allowing  the
       appeal outside of the Immigration Rules the FTTJ erred in law and  I
       set aside her decision.

 Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

      I set aside the decision

      I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it


    Anonymity
