For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals from the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing his appeal against the decision by the Secretary of State to
    refuse to grant him leave to remain under Appendix FM or on  Article  8
    grounds outside the Rules as the spouse of a British  national  present
    and settled here.  The First-tier Tribunal did not  make  an  Anonymity
    Direction, and I do not consider that the Appellant requires  anonymity
    for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.



The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 2 November 2016 Judge P  J  M  Hollingworth  granted  the  Appellant
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal for the following reasons:

         "(i) At paragraph 17 of the decision  the  Judge  was  referred  to
             being bound by the wording of the statute and Regulations  and
             states that his discretion is very limited.

         (ii) It is  arguable  that  in  carrying  out  the  proportionality
             exercise, the Judge's approach had been feted on  the  footing
             of  considering  that  his  discretion  was  very  limited  in
             contradistinction to carrying  out  a  balancing  exercise  in
             relation to all the factors bearing upon proportionality.   At
             the outset of paragraph 17 the  Judge  refers  to  considering
             where the balance lies.

         (iii)    An arguable error of law has arisen in that it is  unclear
             whether the outcome of the proportionality exercise  has  been
             affected by the Judge's  view  that  his  discretion  is  very
             limited   without   attributing   weight   to   the   elements
             appertaining to the proportionality exercise on the footing of
             a free ranging analysis  applying  the  relevant  criteria  in
             deciding where the balance lies.

         (iv)  It  is  further  arguable  that  in  deciding   whether   the
             Immigration Rules were not fulfilled the Judge has not set out
             a sufficient analysis  of  where  the  distinction  lies  into
             finding insurmountable obstacles between  such  obstacles  and
             considerable  difficulties  where  it  is  arguable  that  the
             cumulative effects of difficulties fall to be assessed."

Relevant Background Facts

 3. The Appellant is a national of Algeria, who is aged 59.  He is  married
    to a British national, Ann Boudjemaa (n�e Gladwell), who  is  56  years
    old.  The Appellant entered the United Kingdom on 10 September 2002  on
    a visit visa, on the expiry of which on 19 February  2003  he  remained
    unlawfully.  He met his partner in July 2009  and  they  were  lawfully
    married on 13 March 2012.  It is not disputed that they enjoy a genuine
    and subsisting marriage.

 4. The Appellant's first application for leave to remain as the spouse  of
    a settled person was refused on 18 February 2013.  He made a subsequent
    application on the basis of family and private life which  was  refused
    on 4 April  2014.   On  4  April  2015,  the  Appellant  made  a  fresh
    application for leave to remain on the basis of his family and  private
    life in the UK.

 5. In the covering letter, his legal  representatives  asserted  that  the
    Appellant came within the scope of  paragraph  EX.1.   His  spouse  had
    lived in the UK since birth.  She had an adult son and a grandson  aged
    eight months.  She was a carer for her mother Nancy,  and  her  father,
    Clark, aged 83 and 87 respectively, and had been officially  recognised
    as such.  She  received  a  carer's  allowance  for  her  mother.   Mrs
    Boudjemaa herself suffered from type II  diabetes  mellitus  which  was
    diagnosed in 2001. She also suffered from depression.

 6. It was  submitted  that  the  combination  of  Mrs  Boudjemaa's  health
    condition, the cultural barriers that existed in Algeria in relation to
    women, alongside the inability of her parents to relocate with  her  so
    as to continue to enjoy family life  with  their  daughter  and  carer,
    amounted to insurmountable obstacles.

 7. The application was refused on 16 June 2015.  With reference to EX.1(b)
    it was acknowledged that the Appellant's partner was settled in the  UK
    and was in employment here.  This does not  mean  that  they  would  be
    unable to live together in  Nigeria.   It  was  acknowledged  that  her
    elderly mother required care, but the support that  she  got  could  be
    provided by the NHS.  As a  result  of  this,  the  Appellant  did  not
    satisfy the requirements EX.1(b).  Although relocating to Algeria might
    cause a degree of hardship for his British partner,  the  Secretary  of
    State had not  seen  any  evidence  to  suggest  that  there  were  any
    insurmountable  obstacles  preventing  them   from   continuing   their
    relationship in Algeria.

 8.  The  Secretary  of  State  also  made  a   decision   on   exceptional
    circumstances.  The Appellant had raised the issue that both he and his
    partner had strong private and family ties in the UK and they should be
    permitted to stay on this basis.  However relationships  with  extended
    family members were not recognised under Appendix FM and therefore  had
    not been considered as part of his application.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 9. The Appellant's appeal came before Judge D Ross sitting at Hatton Cross
    in the First-tier Tribunal  on  18  May  2016.  Mr  Palmer  of  Counsel
    appeared on behalf of the Appellant, and there  was  no  appearance  on
    behalf of the respondent.

10. The Judge received oral evidence from the Appellant, Mrs Boudjemaa  and
    Mr Thomas Gladwell, the Appellant's stepson.  The  Judge  also  read  a
    letter from the Appellant's father-in-law, who said  his  daughter  had
    always been very close to the family.  If she left, this would  destroy
    the whole family.

11. In her evidence, Mrs Boudjemaa said that she had bought a property next
    to her parents.  Her son had recently split up with his partner and was
    living with her again.  He was now 27 years old and he had a  child  of
    19 months.  This grandson was a great pleasure to her.   She  had  been
    diagnosed with diabetes type II and was  on  medication,  and  she  was
    regularly monitored  by  her  doctor.   Both  her  parents  had  health
    problems.  Her mother had problems with her lungs, and  they  both  had
    diabetes.  Her father had a heart condition and arthritis.  Her  mother
    suffered from dementia and a carer came in  every  morning.   She  felt
    that her family needed her in the UK, and that she could not leave  the
    UK because of her commitments.

12. She used to get a carer's allowance in respect of her mother,  but  she
    now worked full-time.  She had stopped getting the allowance in  August
    2015.  Her parents only lived two doors away and she went round to  see
    them when she got back from work.  She also helped  at  weekends.   Her
    gross pay was �15,000-�16,000 per annum for 40 hours  work  each  week.
    She could not do more than this.

13. In his subsequent decision, Judge Ross said  as  follows  at  paragraph
    [12]:

         Although I accept that there  would  be  considerable  difficulties
         faced by the Appellant's wife if they had to move back to  Algeria,
         and  in  particular  difficulties   with   employment,   and   with
         accommodation, and with the health of Mrs Boudjemaa, these  do  not
         amount to difficulties which could not be overcome or would  entail
         very serious hardship.  In considering this part of the appeal I am
         not entitled to take into account the effect on  other  members  of
         the family still living in the UK.  The difficulties must relate to
         the  Appellant's  difficulties  and  those  of   his   partner   in
         resettling, and not the other members of the family who  remain  in
         the United Kingdom and will miss their contribution to their lives.



14. The Judge went on to address an Article 8 claim outside the Rules,  and
    he considered proportionality at paragraph [16] to [18].   At  [17]  he
    said that, in considering where the balance lay, he took  into  account
    that the Appellant and his wife had been completely frank and honest in
    their evidence.  The Appellant's wife had a role not only as a wife  to
    the Appellant, but also as somebody who gave a great deal of support to
    her parents. She would find it difficult to adjust to living abroad  at
    the age of 56.  However there were other members of the family who were
    able to give the parents support, in particular she had two sisters and
    a brother, although they did not live nearby, and she also had  a  son.
    Although it would cause considerable disruption to the family  to  have
    to make arrangements which were different to the  sort  of  ones  which
    were presently made, "I am  bound  by  the  wording  of  the  statutory
    regulations,  and  my  discretion  is  very  limited."   Although   the
    Appellant had lived in the UK for 13 years, and now  had  been  married
    for 14 years, and had been with his wife since 2009, he could not  give
    much weight to the family life  which  they  had  established  together
    because the Appellant had not had a right  to  remain  in  the  country
    since the expiry of his visitor's visa in February 2003.

15. At the time of getting married, the Appellant's wife knew that  he  had
    no right to live in the country, but hoped that  things  would  somehow
    work out.  He also appreciated that being separated from her  son  aged
    27 would be a considerable wrench, but the Convention did not in normal
    circumstances protect the right of children to live with their  parents
    indefinitely, or for their parents to have children living with them or
    close by.  Similarly, although  the  Appellant's  wife  did  have  some
    medical problems, these were not life-threatening, and  he  could  only
    give limited weight to the fact that the standard of medical  care  was
    probably inferior in Algeria.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

16. At the hearing before me determined whether an error of  law  was  made
    out, Ms Gasparro developed the arguments advanced  in  the  application
    for permission to appeal.

17. In  reply,  Mr  Tufan  submitted  that  the  Judge's  approach  to  the
    assessment under EX.1 was in line with the guidance given by the  Court
    of Appeal in Agyarko v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 440, and no  error  of  law
    was made out.

18. After hearing from both representatives, I ruled that an error  of  law
    was made out, and I gave my reasons for so finding in short  form,  but
    said that I would give extended written reasons in due course.  This  I
    do below.  The representatives were in agreement that  the  appropriate
    course was for the appeal to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for
    a de novo hearing.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

19. Ms Gasparro submitted that the Judge misdirected himself in stating  in
    paragraph [12] that he was not entitled to take into account the effect
    on other members of the family still living in the  UK  when  assessing
    the question of insurmountable obstacles under paragraph EX.1(b).

20. Ms Gasparro was unable to refer me to any authority on the point.   She
    relied on the proposition that Appendix FM was  supposed  to  be  human
    rights compliant, and so she submitted it was  in  the  spirit  of  the
    Rules that the effect on other family members should  come  within  the
    scope of an assessment under paragraph EX.1(b).

21. In the absence of authority on the issue, I do not  consider  that  the
    Judge was clearly wrong to find that under the  Rules  the  apprehended
    difficulties must relate to the Appellant's difficulties and  those  of
    his partner in resettling; and not to  the  consequential  difficulties
    which will be faced  by  other  members  of  the  family  who  will  be
    remaining in the United Kingdom.

22. The Judge's construction of the Rule is supported by authority and  the
    stated purpose of Appendix FM.  It is well established that Appendix FM
    is not  a  complete  code.   It  is  precisely  for  that  reason  that
    applicants  who  cannot  bring  themselves  within  Appendix   FM   can
    nonetheless potentially qualify for leave to remain outside  the  Rules
    if there are sufficiently compelling circumstances.

23. Gen.1.1 sets out the purpose of the Rules  contained  in  Appendix  FM.
    They reflect how, under Article 8 of the Human Rights  Convention,  the
    balance will be struck between the right to  respect  for  private  and
    family life and the legitimate aims of  protecting  national  security,
    public safety and the economic well-being of the UK; the prevention  of
    disorder and crime;  the  protection  of  health  or  morals;  and  the
    protection of rights and freedoms of others and in doing so  they  also
    reflect the relevant public interest considerations as set out in  Part
    5A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

24. Accordingly, the Judge did not err in law in holding that  he  was  not
    entitled to take into account the effect on other members of the family
    remaining in the UK when assessing whether the  Appellant  could  bring
    himself within the ambit of EX.1(b).

25. However, I find that an error of law is made out for the  other  reason
    put forward by Ms Gasparro, which was the Judge's failure  to  consider
    the  difficulties  faced  by  Mrs  Boudjemaa  on   a   cumulative   and
    comprehensive basis.  In his brief discussion, the  Judge  referred  to
    difficulties in employment, accommodation and Mrs  Boudjemaa's  health,
    but he left  out  of  the  equation  the  cultural  barrier  which  Mrs
    Boudjemaa would face in  Algeria.   The  Secretary  of  State's  policy
    recognises that cultural barriers might  be  relevant,  "in  situations
    where the partner would be so disadvantaged  that  they  could  not  be
    expected to go and live in that country".

26. For a 56 year old woman who has lived all her life in England, enforced
    re-settlement in a Francophone and  predominantly  Islamic,  and  hence
    patriarchal, society in North Africa,  would  arguably  entail,  as  Ms
    Gasparro submits, that  Mrs  Boudjemaa  would  not  have  a  reasonable
    expectation of being able to lead an adequate private life outside  the
    home.   It  is  strongly  arguable  that  her  prospects  for  personal
    development and fulfilment at her age in an alien culture and  society,
    where she does not speak the local language, are very bleak,  and  thus
    unjustifiably harsh.

27. Turning to the alternative Article 8 claim outside the Rules, precisely
    because the Secretary of State had expressly  excluded  the  impact  on
    relationships with extended family members from her consideration under
    EX.1(b),  the  Judge  had  a  duty  to  address  this  issue   in   the
    proportionality assessment which arises at  stage  (v)  of  the  Razgar
    test.

28. The Judge's assessment is inadequate because he  only  focuses  on  the
    practicalities of  sourcing  alternative  carers  for  Mrs  Boudjemaa's
    parents in the UK, rather than upon the  threatened  interference  with
    family ties.  He finds that other family members could look  after  Mrs
    Boudjemaa's parents in her absence,  but  this  does  not  address  the
    emotional impact of separating close family members.

29. Although the parents do not live under the same roof as  the  Appellant
    and his wife, they live only two doors away, enabling Mrs Boudjemaa  to
    play a major role in their lives  as  a  supplementary  carer.   It  is
    arguable that the Appellant's wife enjoys family life not only with her
    parents, whose dependency on her goes beyond more than normal emotional
    ties, but also with her 27 year old son and her young grandson, both of
    whom are members of her household, (albeit the  grandson  is  not  with
    them all the time, but also lives with his mother).

30. The Judge was right that he could not give much weight  to  the  family
    life established between the Appellant and  his  wife,  but  there  was
    nothing in Section 117B of the 2002 Act that prevented him from  giving
    due weight to the strength of Mrs  Boudjemaa's  ties  to  other  family
    members in the UK, and to the major  disruption  to  such  family  ties
    which would be consequential upon Mrs Boudjemaa having to  relocate  to
    Algeria in order to carry on married  life  with  the  Appellant  on  a
    permanent basis.

31. For the above reasons, the decision appealed against contains an  error
    of law such that it must be set aside and remade.

Conclusion

32. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law,  and
    accordingly the decision is set aside.

Directions

33. This appeal shall be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a de  novo
    hearing.

34. None of the findings of fact made by the  previous  Tribunal  shall  be
    preserved.

No anonymity direction is made.
