Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr P Ward, a Consultant with James & Co, Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The  appellant  in  this  appeal  is  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  -
    Islamabad, but I shall refer to her as the claimant and I  shall  refer
    to the respondent as the respondent, to avoid confusion.

2.   The respondent is a national of Afghanistan, who was born on 18th  May,
    1988.  She made application to the claimant for entry clearance with  a
    view to settlement as the spouse of a person present and settled in the
    United  Kingdom  under  Paragraph  281  of  Statement  of  Changes   in
    Immigration Rules, HC 395, as amended ("the immigration rules").    Her
    application was dated 7 July,  2012,  and  it  was  considered  by  the
    claimant who refused the application on 20 November, 2012.

3.   The  claimant  refused  the  application  under  paragraphs  281(i)(a),
    281(ii), 281(iii), 281(iv), and 281(v).

4.   The Notice of Refusal of entry clearance said this:

         "You have applied to join your spouse Masood Alokozai in the United
         Kingdom.


         You have submitted  the  following  as  evidence  of  your  English
         language ability:


           . a certificate for City & Guilds Entry Level 1  Certificate  in
             Esol International (Spoken) (Preliminary Article 1).


         In order to meet the English Language requirement you must  provide
         an original English language test certificate or test  certificates
         in speaking and listening from an English  language  test  provider
         which clearly shows the  applicant's  name  and  the  qualification
         obtained (which must meet or exceed  the  level  Article  1  (Basic
         Speaker) of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR).   In
         order for the certificates to be valid you also need to submit  the
         notification of candidate results to show that you have met Article
         1 level in speaking and listening.  You have also not provided  any
         details about any other way that you consider you meet the  English
         language requirement and have not stated you are  exempt  from  the
         requirement.  Therefore I  am  not  satisfied  that  you  meet  the
         requirements of paragraph 281(1)(a)(ii) of HC 395.


         You state your relationship began on  1/9/09  and  you  married  on
         1/9/10.  You state you last saw your sponsor at  the  time  of  the
         application on 7/6/12.  I note that you previously applied to  join
         your sponsor (ISB/1666773) and  your  application  was  refused  in
         December 2011 as you submitted false  HSBC  bank  statements.   You
         state you keep in contact by phone,  email  and  Skype.   You  have
         provided phone cards as  evidence  of  regular  contact  with  your
         sponsor however these cards  have  no  name  or  contact  or  usage
         details.  There is no ability to show who  has  purchased  or  used
         them.  I am also aware that these cards are  readily  available  to
         purchase second hand even following full usage of the time and cost
         of the cards advertised actively.   You  have  provided  copies  of
         emails.  I note they are from you to your sponsor and your  sponsor
         to you.  However I note the emails are written in English.  I  have
         taken into account that you have not  submitted  a  City  &  Guilds
         showing your level of English in reading and writing,  but  on  the
         basis that this has been omitted and your level spoken  of  English
         is Article 1 level, the content of the emails is  above  Article  1
         level.  This leads me to doubt that the emails have  actually  been
         written by you or you are able to comprehend what your sponsor  has
         written to you.  You have  not  presented  any  evidence  of  Skype
         contact.  I have taken into account the letter from  Amin  Exchange
         stating money  transfers  are  sent  regularly  but  there  are  no
         corresponding receipts.  I attach little weight to this letter  and
         financial dependency in isolation does not demonstrate a subsisting
         marriage.  You state your sponsor has visited you twice and  whilst
         I acknowledge the Afghan stamps in your sponsor's passport there is
         no evidence to show your sponsor visited you during these visits by
         way of photographs or other evidence.  I am not satisfied you enjoy
         the level of contact claimed or that your marriage  is  subsisting.
         In the absence of any other evidence that may allow me to  consider
         regular contact with your sponsor, I  am  not  satisfied  that  you
         intend to live permanently with your sponsor  as  spouse  or  civil
         partner and that the marriage or civil partnership  is  subsisting.
         281(iii).


         I note in your previous application  for  settlement  (ISB/1666773)
         that you submitted  false  HSBC  bank  statements.   You  have  not
         provided  an  explanation  why  you  submitted  false   HSBC   bank
         statements  in  this  application.   As  you   have   applied   for
         settlement, paragraph 320(7B) cannot be applied and the application
         falls under paragraph 320(7C).   Nonetheless  submission  of  false
         documents  in  an  entry  clearance  application   undermines   the
         credibility of your application.  As evidence of funds available to
         you in the UK from your sponsor you have produced accounts (sponsor
         is self-employed taxi driver).  The account  statement  shows  that
         your sponsor's income for 7.5 months was �12,610 including national
         insurance  and  tax.   This  equates  to  �1,050  per  month.   The
         Department of Work  and  Pensions  guidelines  recommendations  for
         maintenance are �111.45 per week per couple, �64.99 per child under
         18, and �7.45 family premium per week.  Therefore for  your  family
         the maintenance requirement would be �111.45 (�482.95  per  month).
         You have submitted your sponsor's  tenancy  agreement  which  shows
         rent is �1,350 per month.  I have noted your sponsor has �6,097  as
         of 30/04/12 in savings but given  their  financial  commitments  as
         detailed above I  am  satisfied  that  these  funds  will  soon  be
         exhausted after your arrival  in  the  UK.   It  is  apparent  your
         sponsor's income is not sufficient to maintain and accommodate  you
         and your additional family members in the  United  Kingdom  without
         recourse to public funds. 281(iv)(v)


         In your application you have stated that your sponsor  is  a  self-
         employed taxi driver and I note he has an income  of  approximately
         �1,050 a month.  The Barclays bank statements submitted in  support
         of your  application  do  not  show  any  regular  transactions  or
         deposits that reflect amounts claimed as earnings, for  example  in
         April 2012 a total of �2,880 was credited  to  the  account.   This
         leads me to doubt that the Barclays bank statement is  an  accurate
         reflection of your sponsor's financial circumstances or  that  this
         money is available to you.  You have failed to provide evidence  to
         satisfy me that you will be adequately  maintained  in  the  United
         Kingdom without recourse to public funds. 281(v)


         You state you intend to work  in  the  UK  but  you  are  currently
         unemployed and supported by your spouse/family members.  Given  the
         current world-wide economic downturn and your low-level of  English
         I am not satisfied that you will find gainful employment as  easily
         as you believe in the current climate.  You have not completed  any
         research or sought advice for  any  employment  in  any  particular
         field, nor have you shown any evidence of  transferable  skills  to
         enable you to obtain employment in the United Kingdom.  I note that
         you state you are unemployed and have provided no evidence  of  any
         educational qualifications, skills or work experience  therefore  I
         believe you  will  be  seeking  employment  in  an  over  saturated
         unskilled job market.  I am not satisfied your job prospects in the
         UK are realistic.  I am not satisfied you will find any  meaningful
         employment that will relieve the financial burden you  will  impose
         on your sponsor.  Therefore on the balance of  probabilities  I  am
         not therefore satisfied that you can adequately  maintain  yourself
         in the United Kingdom without recourse to  public  funds.  281(v)."
         [My emphasis]

5.   The respondent appealed and her appeal  was  heard  on  12th  February,
    2014, by First-tier Tribunal Judge S J Clarke at Taylor House.

6.   The judge noted that the respondent had failed to  submit  notification
    of results of her English language test certificate, but did  not  note
    that the reason the Entry Clearance Officer refused the application was
    because she had only provided a test result in respect of her  speaking
    and listening ability, not  in  respect  of  her  reading  and  writing
    ability.

7.   Unfortunately, the judge did not set out a pr�cis  or  summary  of  the
    evidence she received  and   I  was  concerned  to  discover  that  the
    respondent had, apparently, submitted a bundle  of  documents  the  day
    before the hearing, but there are no respondent's documents in the file
    in the file.  The Entry Clearance  Officer  does  not  appear  to  have
    received these documents either.

8.   The judge also failed to make a note of the submissions  made  to  her.
    This would not normally be quite so crucial, except that in paragraph 9
    of  her  determination,  Judge  Clarke  said  that  she  preferred  the
    submissions made by the respondent's solicitor.  Unfortunately a reader
    of the determination is not given  any  indication  as  to  what  those
    submissions may have been.  The judge does not set out the requirements
    of paragraph 281 in her determination, but at paragraph 10,  she  noted
    that the respondent produced certificates  of  results  which  were  in
    existence at  the  date  of  decision  presumably  in  respect  of  the
    appellant's English language abilities.  It is  not  clear  what  these
    certificates were, because the judge does not say, but the judge  finds
    that the appellant has discharged the burden on her.   I  believe  that
    the judge may have overlooked  the  fact  that  the  Immigration  Rules
    require that applicants must have passed their English Language test at
    one sitting, so that two or more certificates showing that an applicant
    had passed the test in some aspects at one sitting and then passed  the
    test in other subjects at another sitting are not sufficient.

9.   It is not clear exactly  what  burden  the  respondent  has  satisfied,
    because the judge does not appear to  have  appreciated  that  she  was
    under the burden of proving that she was able to read, write and  speak
    and listen in English to the required level.

10.  The judge found that the marriage between the  respondent  and  sponsor
    was  subsisting,  but  she  does  not  explain  why  she  reached  that
    conclusion.  She may well in fact have been entirely correct  to  reach
    that conclusion, but without explaining why she did, the reader is left
    in doubt.

11.  There is reference to a child, but there is no clear  finding  made  by
    the judge that the child is in fact a child of  the  marriage.   I  was
    told today by Mr Ward that a birth certificate was  produced,  but  the
    judge has made no clear finding on it.  The judge does not say that she
    has examined the birth certificate.

12.  The judge noted at paragraph 16 of the determination that  the  sponsor
    has now produced trading accounts showing that during the period  April
    2012 to April 2014 he made a net profit of �25,086.  However, the  date
    that the judge was concerned with was the date of the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's decision, namely, November 2012 so that what would have  been
    relevant would have been details of the earnings of the sponsor  up  to
    that date.  Bearing in mind that the earnings for the  previous  twelve
    months were less than half  the  earnings  for  the  subsequent  twelve
    months, the accounts may have deserved  closer  examination  and  clear
    findings made on them.

13.  Mr Ward sought to persuade me that the deficit, so far as  the  English
    language certificate was concerned, was that the  notification  of  the
    English language test results  had  not  been  provided,  but  that  is
    clearly not what the Entry Clearance Officer  says  in  the  Notice  of
    Refusal.  Mr Ward  quite  properly  pointed  out  that  the  judge  has
    considered the telephone records and noted that the date of  conception
    of the child accords with the evidence provided of the sponsor's  dates
    of his visit to Afghanistan and that the judge  has  therefore  clearly
    examined the evidence properly.

14.  Unfortunately, without knowing precisely what the evidence  before  the
    judge was, and without clear findings in respect of  that  evidence,  I
    believe that the determination is defective.

15.  In giving my decision extempore, it occurs to me  that  the  judge  has
    not actually said what the standard of proof is  in  the  appeal.   But
    that is not the reason that I am finding the determination cannot stand
    because it was not a point challenged by the claimant.  It is merely  a
    further indication of the inadequacy of the determination.

16.  Unfortunately, the sponsor is not present.  It  appears  that  Mr  Ward
    only yesterday received notification of the hearing from his client  in
    Afghanistan.  The Tribunal's file clearly indicates that notice of  the
    hearing was sent to both the sponsor and to Mr Ward and I apologise  if
    there has been any failing on the part of the Tribunal,  but  according
    to the file notices were sent by first class post  on  21  March  2013.
    For whatever reason, it appears that Mr Ward certainly did not  receive
    his notice and the sponsor is not present.

17.  It is not, therefore, possible for me to go on and correct  the  errors
    in the determination because the failure of the  judge  to  make  clear
    findings means that oral evidence will be required  and  to  avoid  any
    further delay and being mindful  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Statement, I am proposing to remit this appeal for  hearing  afresh  by
    the First-tier Tribunal by a judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Clarke.

18.  Any determination should be self-contained  and  both  parties  to  the
    appeal should be able to properly understand the reasons why they  have
    been successful or been unsuccessful.  It is not sufficient  simply  to
    refer  to  evidence  being  recorded,  for  example  in  a  Record   of
    Proceedings and neither is it acceptable  not  to  record  at  least  a
    summary of the evidence, so that anyone reading the  determination  can
    ascertain whether adequate findings have been made.
