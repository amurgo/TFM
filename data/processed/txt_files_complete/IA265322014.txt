Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Bustani, Counsel, for Lam & Meerabux, Croydon
For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Jamaica born on 11th October  1975.   She
    appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated 29th  April  2014
    refusing to issue her with a residence  card  as  confirmation  of  her
    permanent residence as the former  spouse  of  an  EEA  national.   Her
    appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Griffith  on  13th
    November 2013 and dismissed under  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
    2006 in a decision promulgated on 3rd December 2015.

 2. An application for permission to appeal  was  made  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant.  This states that both parties at the appeal  hearing  along
    with the judge, made a mistake by considering whether  the  Appellant's
    ex-husband had been exercising his treaty rights up to 18th March 2013.
     The correct date is 7th May 2013, the date  of  the  decree  absolute.
    The  judge  realised  this  error  while  writing  her  decision.   The
    permission states that the Appellant's representatives should have been
    made aware of this so that they could adduce  further  evidence  up  to
    that date.  The permission states that the  judge  did  not  positively
    find that Mr Fortes (the Appellant's ex-husband)  had  been  exercising
    treaty rights up to the end of the 2012/2013 tax  year  but  there  was
    some evidence that he had been exercising  treaty  rights  during  that
    period.  It states that the appellant's representatives could have made
    the argument that, if the judge accepted  on  the  documents  provided,
    taken together with the Appellant's evidence, Mr Fortes was  exercising
    treaty rights right up to 6th April 2013 he was unlikely to have ceased
    self-employment in the next month.

 3. There is Rule 24 response but the decision had not been attached to the
    Grounds of Application and the Respondent was unable to  comment  on  a
    material error of law.

The Hearing

 4. This is an application for a retained  right  of  permanent  residence.
    Counsel submitted that this Appellant previously had a five year permit
    from 21st April 2011  until  21st  April  2016  and  then  applied  for
    permanent residence under Regulation 15(1F).  She submitted that it was
    accepted that the marriage had lasted for  three  years  and  that  the
    Appellant's spouse had been  exercising  treaty  rights  and  that  the
    Appellant has been exercising treaty rights  since  the  divorce.   The
    issue is whether her ex-husband was exercising treaty rights up to  7th
    May 2013 which is the date of the decree absolute.

 5. I was referred to paragraphs 24 and 25 of the decision.   Paragraph  24
    deals with Mr Fortes' employment with  Heathfields  Security.   Counsel
    submitted that there is evidence that he started work on 21st September
    2010 with them and this lasted until 27th January 2013.   At  paragraph
    45 Mr Fortes' self-employment is dealt with and based on this the judge
    is satisfied that Mr Fortes was working until the end of the  2012/2013
    tax year which is 6th April 2013.  She  submitted  therefore  that  the
    period in dispute is from 6th April  2013  until  7th  May  2013.   She
    submitted that the judge, when writing her  decision,  discovered  that
    the parties had been using the wrong date and the judge  at  that  time
    should have called the matter back to court to enable the Appellant  to
    put forward further evidence about this one  month  period.   The  last
    sentence in the decision is: "The Appellant has failed to establish  to
    the required standard of proof that her former husband was a  qualified
    person exercising treaty rights at the date of the divorce (the  decree
    absolute)."  This is the date of 7th May 2013.  She submitted  that  as
    the Appellant was not given a chance to deal with this there must be an
    error of law.  I was referred to the P60  which  was  attached  to  the
    grounds of  application  which  makes  it  clear  that  Mr  Fortes  was
    exercising treaty rights up to 5th April 2014.  She submitted  that  it
    is clear that he was economically active for the relevant period.

 6. The Presenting Officer submitted that the issue is  whether  the  judge
    had given the Appellant and the Respondent the opportunity  to  provide
    further evidence or make further submissions using the correct dates.

 7. I was referred to paragraph 22 of  the  decision  in  which  the  judge
    states that the date of 18th March 2013,  which  is  the  date  of  the
    decree nisi, is the wrong date.  He submitted that if the  judge  found
    that Mr Fortes was working up to 18th March 2013 there is  an  argument
    that the judge could have allowed the appeal based on  the  balance  of
    probabilities for an additional one month  period  or  she  could  have
    given the Appellant an opportunity to submit more evidence  up  to  7th
    May 2013.

 8. The Presenting Officer referred to the two  sources  of  income.   With
    regard to  Mr  Fortes'  salaried  employment  with  Heathfields  I  was
    referred to paragraph 24 of the decision.  The last payslip seen by the
    judge was dated 27th January 2013 and he submitted  that  even  if  the
    wrong date was used this is two months before 18th March 2013 and there
    was no P60 for the period between 27th January 2013 and the end of  the
    tax year.  He  submitted  that  the  judge  took  the  Appellant's  ex-
    husband's taxable income up to 27th January 2013 but he submitted  that
    there was no evidence before the judge that Mr Fortes was working after
    that date.

 9. I was referred to paragraphs 16 and 17 of the decision which deal  with
    Counsel's submissions and he submitted that because Mr Fortes' salaried
    employment stopped in January 2013 there is no  evidence  that  he  was
    continuing to work for the security company until the end of  that  tax
    year.  The judge states at paragraph 14 that  the  Appellant  does  not
    know how many hours her ex-husband was working.  The  appellant  refers
    to HMRC papers which came through her door  about  her  ex-husband  but
    these do not refer to his salaried employment but his self-employment.

10. Counsel objected stating that this is a new issue  and  the  Presenting
    Officer is not entitled to raise this.

11. The Presenting Officer then referred  me  to  the  Appellant's  bundle,
    pages 57  to  64  which  are  self-assessment  tax  calculations.   The
    Presenting Officer submitted that Mr Fortes' self-employment  is  dealt
    with at paragraph 25 of the decision.   The  judge  has  accepted  that
    during the tax year 2012/2013 Mr Fortes was economically active in  the
    United Kingdom. He then points out that during the next tax year  there
    is no evidence that he was working up until 7th May 2013.  He submitted
    that there must therefore be an error  in  the  judge's  decision.   He
    submitted that the fact that the judge did not give  the  Appellant  an
    opportunity to put further evidence forward for the extra period is  an
    error but not a material error.  He submitted that based  on  what  was
    before the judge there was already a shortfall in the period he worked.

12. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that both parties referred  to  the
    relevant date being 18th March 2013.  She submitted that  as  this  was
    the wrong date there must be a material error of  law  in  the  judge's
    decision.

13. She submitted that the judge finds there to  be  evidence  of  economic
    activity by Mr Fortes for the year ending  2012/2013.   The  Respondent
    did not challenge this and she cannot challenge it now.

14. I was referred to the P60 attached to the grounds  of  application  for
    permission to appeal and she submitted that it is  now  clear  that  Mr
    Fortes was economically active during the  tax  year  ending  in  April
    2014.  She submitted that on the balance of probabilities he  had  been
    economically active for the additional month due to his self-employment
    and that the Appellant should have been given  the  chance  to  provide
    more evidence and/or submissions for the extra month.

15. I was asked to find that there is  a  material  error  of  law  in  the
    judge's decision.

Decision and Reasons

16. There was an error throughout this hearing  as  both  parties  and  the
    judge were dealing with the date of divorce as being  8th  March  2013.
    The correct date is 7th May 2013.

17. When the judge was writing her decision she realised the mistake.   She
    deals with this at paragraph 22.  The  judge  was  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant's ex-husband was exercising  treaty  rights  up  until  April
    2013.  The reason she dismissed the appeal was that there is a lack  of
    evidence of him working for the next month up until 7th May 2013  which
    is the date of the decree absolute.

18. The Appellant had no chance to make submissions or  produce  additional
    evidence about this and I find that the judge made a material error  of
    law by not pointing this out to the Appellant's representative so  that
    additional evidence could have been  produced  or  further  submissions
    made for the one month after 6th April 2013.

Notice of Decision

19. I find that there is a material error of law in this  judge's  decision
    for the above reasons.

20. I direct that the judge's decision, promulgated on  3rd  December  2015
    must be set aside.

21. No findings of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  can  stand.   Under  Section
    12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and Practice Statement 7.2 the  nature  and
    extent of judicial fact-finding necessary for the decision to be remade
    is such that it is appropriate to remit  the  case  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  The members of the First-tier Tribunal chosen to  reconsider
    the case are not to include Judge Griffith.

22. Anonymity has not been directed.
