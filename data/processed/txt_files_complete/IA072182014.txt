For the Appellant:     Ms E King, instructed by Rahman & Company
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, who is a national of Pakistan where she was born  on  10
    November 1983, has been granted permission to appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes. In his decision dated  2  July  2014,
    the judge gave his reasons for dismissing the appeal by  the  appellant
    against the decision of the respondent dated 31 December 2013  refusing
    to vary her leave to  remain  and  making  a  decision  to  remove  the
    appellant.

 2. The background to the case is this. The appellant had made  application
    in-country on 3 December 2013 for further leave to remain as a  Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant and for a biometric residence permit. She was
    awarded the 30 points sought for Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies
    but none of the points sought for Maintenance (funds).  The reasons the
    respondent refused to award those points were that  the  appellant  had
    failed to show  she  was  in  possession  of  at  least  ï¿½1,600  for  a
    consecutive 28  day  period  to  meet  the  Tier  4  (General)  Student
    maintenance requirements.  Specifically, the bank  statement  submitted
    showed funds between 20 November 2013 and 4 December 2013 and  did  not
    demonstrate the consecutive 28 day period required under the rules.

 3. The grounds relied on by the  appellant  in  her  appeal  against  that
    decision to the First-tier Tribunal explained that she  had  given  her
    college  (who  had  made  the  application  on  her  behalf)  her  bank
    statements for the period 9 September 2013 until 4 December 2013.   She
    speculates in those grounds  that  either  those  statements  had  been
    mislaid by her college who had completed the application on her  behalf
    or they may have been mislaid by the UK Border Agency.  She also relied
    on a failure by the respondent  to  follow  the  policy  of  evidential
    flexibility and a failure to consider CDS (PBS: "available": Article 8)
    (Brazil) [201] UKUT 00305(IAC) and Pankina v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ  719.
    Finally the appellant argued that the decision  was  not  otherwise  in
    accordance with the law.

 4. The judge heard evidence from the appellant who reiterated that she had
    contacted the  college  who  told  her  that  they  had  sent  all  the
    documents.  He concluded that the burden was on the appellant and  that
    the evidence did not show that she  had  submitted  the  required  bank
    statements or that she gave them  to  the  college  to  submit  on  her
    behalf.

 5. After setting out the evidence, the judge set out his reasons  for  his
    finding  that  the  appellant  had  not  submitted  the  required  bank
    statements. I quote specifically from the determination at [10]:

         "If it was the fault of the college that would not  avail  her  but
         there is no evidence to show that that  is  the  case.   There  was
         nothing in the information before the Secretary of State to suggest
         that there was other information readily available that would  fill
         the evidential gap and so I  find  that  paragraph  245AA  was  not
         engaged."

 6. There are two grounds of challenge.  The first is a complaint that  the
    judge should have identified the weight  he  attached  if  any  to  the
    appellant's account.  This relates  to  the  central  issue  which  was
    whether the bank statements had reached the Secretary of State,  as  it
    was her case they had not.  The appellant could only and  could  go  no
    further than to establish that she had provided the statements  to  the
    college.  She was not in a position to say that the  college  had  then
    sent them to the Secretary of State.  This is  at  best  a  second-hand
    account that  was  to  be  balanced  against  the  assertion  that  the
    statements had not been received and in such  circumstances  the  judge
    was reasonably entitled to look for direct evidence from  the  college.
    That evidence was not there and could easily have  been  provided.   We
    conclude that the judge was entitled to observe in paragraph 8  of  the
    decision that "The absence of evidence directly  from  the  college  to
    confirm what she says is troubling and does not assist her case."

 7. Miss King on behalf of the appellant candidly accepts that there was no
    evidence from the college before the judge as to what they did  and  it
    is significant that even today there is silence  from  the  college  on
    this aspect.

 8. The second ground is essentially a  reworking  of  the  first.   It  is
    stated that the appellant's evidence should have been assessed  in  its
    own right without being subjected to the requirement  as  appears  from
    the determination of corroborative evidence.  This  misses  the  point.
    As we have observed, the most the appellant could say was that she  had
    given the documents to the college and the college told  her  they  had
    sent them on to the Home Office.  The fundamental  difficulty  was  the
    absence of anything from the college.

 9.  As we have observed, it was reasonable to expect the college  to  have
    provided evidence of the documents that they had sent to the  Secretary
    of State and in the absence of that evidence, we are satisfied that the
    judge came to a conclusion rationally  open  to  him  on  the  material
    before him and gave adequate reasons for dismissing the appeal.

10. Accordingly we are not persuaded that the judge erred  in  law  and  we
    therefore dismiss the appeal.
