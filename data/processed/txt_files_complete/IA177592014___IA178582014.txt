                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Bernard  Andonian),  sitting  at  Taylor  House  on  20
    November 2015, to  appeals by a citizen of Jamaica, born 24 April 1973,
    and her son J, born here 25 September 2005.  The  (main)   also  has  a
    daughter, S, born here on 17 April 2015; but her father  is  a  British
    citizen, so she is too.

 2. History   The (main) appellant first came  here  in  1999  on  a  false
    passport; but she was caught on arrival with ï¿½25,000 worth  of  cocaine
    about her, and in due course sentenced to four years' imprisonment  and
    deported in 2001. Not deterred, she returned on a visit visa in her own
    passport in 2002, and overstayed till after the birth of J, by a father
    who has returned to Jamaica and with whom she is not now in  touch,  in
    2005.

 3. Next the appellant was caught shoplifting in 2006: the  police  finger-
    printed her, and let the Home Office know that she  had  been  deported
    under another name. On this the appellant  claimed  asylum,  which  was
    refused, and her appeal finally dismissed in 2007, when she applied for
    leave to remain for herself and J on private and family  life  grounds.
    The Home Office did nothing at all about that,  even  when  J  made  an
    application on his own account in 2012: Miss Isherwood  was  unable  to
    explain why not. Finally  on  21  March  2014  both  applications  were
    dismissed, followed by the birth of S in 2015.

 4. Law       Starting with the statutory scheme,  it  is  clear  that  the
    appellant could not benefit from the 'qualifying child' provision in s.
    117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002,  since  she
    remains liable to deportation as a  foreign  criminal.  Turning  to  s.
    117C, it is clear that

       (1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.
       (2) The more serious the offence committed by  a  foreign  criminal,
          the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.
       (3) In the case of  a  foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
          sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or  more,  the
          public interest requires C's deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
          Exception 2 applies.

    Again, she had been sentenced  to  four  years'  imprisonment,  so  the
    public  interest  required  her  deportation,  whether  or  not   those
    exceptions applied.

 5. Turning to the Rules, this is the position in the present case:

       398. Where a person claims that their deportation would  be  contrary
       to  the  UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
       Convention, and

       (a) the deportation of the person from the UK  is  conducive  to  the
       public good and  in  the  public  interest  because  they  have  been
       convicted of an offence for which  they  have  been  sentenced  to  a
       period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;
       ...
       the Secretary of State in assessing that claim will consider  whether
       paragraph 399 or 399A  applies  and,  if  it  does  not,  the  public
       interest in deportation will only  be  outweighed  by  other  factors
       where there are very compelling circumstances over  and  above  those
       described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

 6. Paragraph 399 (a) is the provision which  allows  people  sentenced  to
    between  12  months'  and  four  years'  imprisonment,  or  liable   to
    deportation on conducive grounds, to  remain  here  with  a  qualifying
    child (one who is a British citizen, or who has  been  here  for  seven
    years or more: see  s.  117D)  with  whom  they  have  a  'genuine  and
    subsisting relationship' and it would be unduly harsh  to  require  the
    child either to go with them, or stay here without them. Paragraph 399A
    applies to people in the same categories; but only where they have been
    lawfully resident in this country for most of their lives,  which  this
    appellant most certainly has not.

 7. J is a qualifying child, having lived here ever since he  was  born  in
    2005. It follows that, for the  judge  lawfully  to  allow  both  these
    appeals on the basis of the effects of separating the appellant from J,
    he needed to consider first whether it would be unjust to J to  do  so;
    but, if the answer were yes, then to go  on  and  ask  himself  whether
    there were 'very compelling circumstances' over and  above  that.  This
    was the main point taken on appeal.


 8. Decision  under  appeal   The  very  experienced  judge  described  the
    appellant's earlier conduct as 'appalling', and went on at paragraph 11
    to note the requirement for 'very  compelling  circumstances',  if  the
    appeals were to be allowed on an article 8 basis. It is  now  clear  of
    course that the deportation section of the Rules forms a complete code;
    so that was what the judge needed to look at first,  as  the  following
    paragraphs show he did.

 9. At paragraph 13 the judge found on the facts that it  would  be  unduly
    harsh for either J or S to be removed to Jamaica with their mother,  or
    to remain here without her. At paragraphs 11 and 14 he made findings of
    fact which the grounds of appeal suggest were not enough to support his
    conclusions;  but for the moment I am concerned with the terms in which
    he expressed those at paragraph 15:

       I do believe in the above circumstances that it would be unreasonable
       to expect the children to leave the UK or to live in the  UK  without
       their mother.

10. While  the  judge  had  noted  the  requirement  for  'very  compelling
    circumstances', there is nothing more about them in his  decision,  and
    nothing to explain what those circumstances might have been,  over  and
    above his finding that it would be unduly harsh for the children to  be
    separated, one way or the other, from  their  mother.  On  this  ground
    alone, the judge's decision was wrong in law, and has to be  set  aside
    and re-made.

11. Fresh decision  I put it to both sides that the judge had  made  enough
    findings of fact for me to re-decide  the  case  there  and  then,  and
    neither dissented. Dealing first with S's position,  at  not  quite  15
    months old, she is at the age where above all she needs to be with  her
    mother, almost whatever the circumstances. While  Mrs  Bassiri-Dezfouli
    suggested that the appellant and her children would face destitution on
    return to Jamaica, Miss Isherwood pointed out  that  they  had  clearly
    lived in a Jamaican milieu  in this country: S's father  is  from  that
    island, and takes some care of his daughter here. It follows  that  the
    appellant and her children are not likely to be entirely friendless  in
    Jamaica. The appellant gave  her  occupation  as  hairdresser  on  both
    children's birth certificates, so is  by  no  means  without  a  useful
    skill.

12. S is of course a British citizen, and cannot be  removed;  but  equally
    she could return from Jamaica to this country as of right whenever  she
    was old enough for her to leave her mother, or enough time  had  passed
    for the appellant to seek re-admission. It does not  seem  to  me  that
    making a decision where her best interests would require her  to  leave
    this country with her mother would be unduly harsh in the first  place,
    let alone raise 'very compelling circumstances'  for  that  not  to  be
    done. So, if S were the only  child  involved,  I  should  dismiss  the
    appellant's appeal.

13. However the real questions are about J. Miss Isherwood  referred  to  a
    decision she was not able to hand up, and was  only  able  to  cite  as
    'AM', apparently meaning AM (s.117B) [2015] UKUT 260. As the full title
    suggests, this, like MA (Pakistan) &  others  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  705  ,
    handed down the day after this case was heard, was a decision about  s.
    117B of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002,  which  as
    already explained does not apply in this case. It is quite  clear  that
    the appellant's own appeal could not possibly succeed, if no child were
    involved; nor is it likely that J's could, if he were of  age  and  had
    established his private and family life in this country  while  he  was
    unlawfully here.

14. As the judge noted at paragraph 14, J has lived here since he was born,
    and is now ten, so long enough in this country to be  registered  as  a
    British citizen as of right if he applied for that. However,  like  the
    judge, I have to deal with the case as the facts are now, which make it
    necessary, if I am to allow both appeals, to  find  not  only  that  it
    would be unduly harsh to J to require him either to go to Jamaica  with
    his mother, or to stay here without her; but also that there are  'very
    compelling circumstances' in his case why  that  should  not  be  done.
    While his best interests must of course  be  a  primary  consideration,
    they can only decide the case in favour  of  the  appellants  if  these
    criteria are satisfied.

15. So far as the 'unduly harsh' question is  concerned,  the  judge  found
    that J

       ... has not been to any other country and only knows England as  his
       home. He is going to school here and doing well. He  interacts  with
       his peers and considers England as his home. It is unfair to make  a
       decision which would affect his welfare and well-being by his having
       to leave the UK, when he is the innocent party  and  should  not  be
       blamed for his mother's misdeeds.

    J was present at the hearing, though I suggested it might be better for
    him to stay outside court, where his mother's character was  likely  to
    be discussed, which she on Mrs  Bassiri-Dezfouli's  advice  agreed  to.
    However I saw enough of him to see that he was a very well-behaved ten-
    year old, smartly dressed in his school uniform, and able  to  sit  and
    amuse himself quietly for quite a long time. For that he is a credit to
    his mother.

16. At J's age, where he has been right through  primary  school,  but  not
    quite finished there yet, it is clearly as unrealistic, as it would  be
    unduly harsh to expect him to stay here without the appellant.  So  the
    first question is whether it would be unduly harsh to expect him to  go
    to Jamaica with her. Even in a non-deportation case, where the question
    is whether it would be unreasonable to expect  a  qualifying  child  to
    leave this country with a parent  with  whom  he  has  a  'genuine  and
    subsisting relationship', it is now clear that the public interest,  in
    that case in the maintenance of immigration control, has  to  be  taken
    into account: see MA (above).

17. That must be all the more so when considering the meaning, in  context,
    of 'unduly harsh': there is  a  very  strong  interest  indeed  in  the
    prevention of crime, including the enforcement of  deportation  orders,
    as to which see CT (Vietnam) [2016] EWCA Civ  488.  The  judge  in  the
    present case did  not  flinch  from  calling  the  appellant's  conduct
    appalling, which indeed it was, in terms of  the  potential  for  human
    misery of what she was carrying. He was equally entitled to  note  that
    it happened a long time ago, and the appellant has been in  no  further
    trouble since, apart of course from the shoplifting in 2006.

18. The balancing exercise to be carried out is between the best  interests
    of J, which as the judge noted are very strongly in favour of  him,  as
    an innocent party, being allowed to stay here, in the only  country  he
    has ever known, and where he has almost finished at primary school; and
    the very strong public interest, even after the time which has gone by,
    in removing his mother. However, even  after  considering  that  public
    interest, I agree with the judge that it would be unduly harsh in these
    particular circumstances  to  make  a  decision  which,  for  practical
    purposes, would require J to go with the appellant to Jamaica, where he
    has never been.

19.  The  remaining  question  is  whether  there  are   'very   compelling
    circumstances' over and above that to justify allowing  these  appeals.
    It is clear from CT (Vietnam)  that  these  must  amount  to  something
    exceptional. Looking at the circumstances of this case, one factor does
    stand out as exceptional.  The  Home  Office  knew  in  2006  that  the
    appellant was the person who had been deported in 2001;  they  knew  no
    later than 2007 that she had a child  born  here,  with  whom  she  was
    applying for leave to remain; and yet they did precisely nothing  about
    this situation, despite the reminder given by J's  own  application  in
    2012, till 2014.

20. If the Home Office had dealt with these applications with anything like
    proper efficiency, or even, to a diminishing extent, at any time before
    2012, when J became a qualifying child, then they would have been fully
    entitled to remove him and his mother to Jamaica. However, instead they
    chose to sit on their hands, while J grew up and went  nearly  all  the
    way through primary school here. If  those  are  not  'very  compelling
    circumstances', over and above its now being  unduly  harsh  to  uproot
    him, for not requiring him to go there with  her  now,  then  I  cannot
    think of a  case  where  the  provisions  of  paragraph  398  could  be
    satisfied, where 398 (a) applied.
