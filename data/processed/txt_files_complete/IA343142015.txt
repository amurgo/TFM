                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent

                            Decision and Reasons



 1. The Tribunal issued a decision on 2 February 2018 requesting  that  the
    parties provide written reasons within 16 days as to why  an  error  of
    law should not be found and  the  appeal  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal following Khan v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.

 2. No response was received from either party within 16 days.

 3. The Tribunal therefore finds an error of law, sets aside  the  decision
    dated 15 March 2017 of Designated Judge Manuell and remits  the  appeal
    to the First-tier Tribunal to be re-made de novo.

 4. The hearing listed for 12 March 2018 is vacated.
