For the Appellant:     Ms A. White, Counsel, instructed by Messrs Dipak
Acharya & Co,
     Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N. Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

A work permit that has expired without being  used  is  not  an  immigration
document for the purposes of section 88(2) of the 2002 Act, whether  or  not
its holder might be able to have it reprinted, reissued or renewed  (compare
MC (S88: meaning of a "passport") [2008] UKAIT 00030).


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen of India born on 17 October 1956,  applied  on
    11 May 2007 for entry clearance to the United Kingdom for  the  purpose
    of undertaking work permit employment.  On 4 June 2007  the  respondent
    decided to refuse the appellant's application.  The appellant purported
    to appeal against that decision and on 13 December 2007 the matter came
    before an Immigration Judge, sitting at  Nottingham.   The  Immigration
    Judge concluded that, contrary to the submissions made on behalf of the
    respondent, the appellant had a right of appeal to the Tribunal against
    the decision in question.  The Immigration Judge further found that the
    appellant met the relevant provisions of the Immigration Rules  and  he
    therefore concluded  his  determination  by  allowing  the  appellant's
    appeal.

2.   On 24 January 2008 reconsideration of the Immigration Judge's  decision
    was ordered under section 103A  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002, on the application of the  respondent,  who  contended
    that, since the appellant's work permit had expired before the date  of
    the immigration decision, section 88(2)(b) of that  Act  precluded  the
    appellant from having a right of appeal because the appellant  did  not
    have "an immigration document of a particular kind (or any  immigration
    document)".  The respondent submitted that, in finding that the expired
    work  permit  of  the  appellant  could  potentially  be  re-issued  or
    reprinted, the Immigration Judge had indulged in speculation.   In  any
    event, the fact was that, as at the date of decision, the  work  permit
    had expired and was not a valid document.

3.   The appellant's work  permit  was  issued  on  20  November  2006.   An
    application for entry clearance, based on that work permit, was refused
    by the respondent on 13 March  2007;  essentially  on  the  basis  that
    insufficient evidence had been provided by the appellant to enable  the
    respondent  to  be  satisfied  that  the  appellant  met  all  of   the
    requirements of paragraph 128 of the Immigration Rules.

4.   The appellant did not appeal against that  decision.   Instead,  on  11
    May 2007 he made a fresh application for entry clearance.  According to
    the respondent, however, the appellant's work permit had expired on  20
    May 2007, some fifteen days  before  the  decision  against  which  the
    appellant purported to appeal.

5.   The notice of decision in response to  that  fresh  application  states
    that the respondent was not satisfied  that  the  appellant's  proposed
    employer would in reality be able to pay the appellant the �20,000  per
    annum salary indicated on the appellant's work permit, given  that  the
    evidence showed that  the  proposed  employer  was  overdrawn  by  some
    �29,168.  The respondent  was,  accordingly,  not  satisfied  that  the
    appellant had disclosed all material facts for the purpose of obtaining
    the work permit.

6.   The notice then says:-

         "Your Work Permit was issued on 20/11/06.  On the reverse  of  the
         Work Permit, it clearly states that it 'ceases to be valid  if  not
         produced to the Immigration Officer at the Port of Arrival  in  the
         UK within six months of issue' ... It has  now  been  almost  seven
         months since your Work Permit was issued.  As such, you do not hold
         a valid Immigration Employment Document."

7.   Somewhat surprisingly, in view of the stance adopted on behalf  of  the
    respondent before the Immigration Judge, the notice of decision  stated
    that the appellant was "entitled to appeal against this decision  under
    section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002".  An
    appeal form was said to be provided with the notice of decision.

8.   Following receipt  of  the  appellant's  notice  of  appeal,  an  Entry
    Clearance Manager reviewed the matter.  So  far  as  financial  matters
    were concerned, the Entry Clearance Manager noted  that  the  appellant
    had asserted that "I will be able to  support  myself"  but  that  this
    assertion had not been substantiated by documentary evidence.  Nor  was
    the Entry Clearance Manager satisfied that the appellant "has addressed
    the validity concerns of paragraph  2  of  the  refusal  notice".   The
    appeal review statement indicates that the decision to refuse was  made
    by reference to paragraphs 128 and 320(15) of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Those provisions read as follows:-

         "128.    The requirements to be met  by  a  person  coming  to  the
                United Kingdom to seek or  take  employment  (unless  he  is
                otherwise eligible for admission for employment under  these
                Rules or is eligible for admission  as  a  seaman      under
                contract to join a ship due to  leave  British  waters)  are
                that he:


                (i)    holds a valid Home Office work permit; and


                (ii)   is not of an age which puts him  outside  the  limits
                    for employment; and


                (iii)  is capable of undertaking the employment specified in
                    the work permit; and


                (iv)    does  not  intend  to  take  employment  except   as
                    specified in his work permit; and


                (v)    is able to maintain and accommodate himself  and  any
                    dependants adequately without recourse to public  funds;
                    and


                (vi)   in the case of a  person  in  possession  of  a  work
                    permit which is valid for a period of 12 months or less,
                    intends to leave the United Kingdom at the  end  of  his
                    approved employment; and


                (vii)  holds a valid  United  Kingdom  entry  clearance  for
                    entry in this capacity except  where  he  holds  a  work
                    permit valid for 6 months or less ... or he is a British
                    National (Overseas), a British  protected  person  or  a
                    person who under the British Nationality Act 1981  is  a
                    British subject.

         320. In addition to the grounds for refusal of entry  clearance  or
                leave to enter set out in Parts  2-8  of  these  Rules,  and
                subject to paragraph 321 below, the  following  grounds  for
                the refusal of entry clearance or leave to enter apply:
              ...
                (15)   whether or not to the holder's knowledge, the  making
                    of false representations or the failure to disclose  any
                    material  fact  for  the   purpose   of   obtaining   an
                    immigration employment document;"
9.   Section 88 (ineligibility) of the 2002 Act reads as follows:-

         "88. (1) This section applies to an immigration decision of a  kind
               referred to     in section 82(2)(a), (b), (d) or (e).


              (2) A person may not appeal under  section  82(1)  against  an
               immigration     decision which is taken on the grounds  that
               he or a person of whom he is      a dependant -


                  (a)  does not satisfy a requirement as to age, nationality
               or citizenship      specified in Immigration Rules,
                  (b)  does not have an immigration document of a particular
               kind (or any        immigration document),


                  ...


              (3) In subsection (2)(b) 'immigration document' means -


                  (a)  entry clearance,


                  (b)  a passport,


                   (c)   a  work  permit  or  other  immigration  employment
               document within          the meaning of section 122, and


                  (d)  a document which relates to a national of  a  country
               other than the      United Kingdom and which is designed  to
               serve the same purpose       as a passport.


              (4) Subsection (2) does not prevent the bringing of an  appeal
               on any or   all  of  the  grounds  referred  to  in  section
               84(1)(b), (c) and (g)."

10.  Section 122 (fee for work permit, &c), as  in  force  at  the  relevant
    time, provides:-

         "(1)     The Secretary of State  may  by  regulations  require  an
         application  for  an      immigration  employment  document  to  be
         accompanied by a fee prescribed in  the regulations.


         (2) In subsection (1) 'immigration employment document' means -


             (a)  a work permit, and


             (b)  any other document which relates  to  employment  and  is
         issued for a      purpose of immigration  rules  or  in  connection
         with leave or enter to          remain in the United Kingdom.


         ...


         (6) In this section -


             'immigration rules' has the meaning given by section 33(1)  of
         the Immigration   Act 1971 (c.77) (interpretation), and


             'work permit' has the meaning given by that section."


11.    Section 33(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 provides that a:-

          'work permit' means a permit indicating, in  accordance  with  the
          immigration rules, that a person named in it is  eligible,  though
          not a British citizen, for entry into the United Kingdom  for  the
          purpose of taking employment;'.

12.  The following features of the appellant's  work  permit  are  relevant.
    The date of issue was 20 November 2006.  The "Period Covered by Permit"
    was "60 months from the date of  leave  to  enter".   Endorsed  on  the
    permit were a number of conditions governing its issue.  Paragraph 3 of
    those conditions reads:-

         "3.  This permit:


             (a)  does not constitute any obligation upon  the  Immigration
                  Officer to give the  holder  leave  to  enter  the  United
                  Kingdom, nor any obligation on the Entry Clearance Officer
                  to issue the visa.


             (b)  may be used only by the  person  named  thereon.   If  an
                  unauthorised person amends the particulars upon the permit
                  it will thereby be rendered invalid.


             (c)  ceases to be valid if not  produced  to  the  Immigration
                  Officer at the port  of  arrival  in  the  United  Kingdom
                  within six months of the date of issue.


             (d)  is valid only for the particular employment for which  it
                  is issued and not for employment of another kind  or  with
                  another   employer,   except   supplementary   employment.
                  Supplementary  employment  is  permitted  in   line   with
                  conditions outlined in the guidance notes  for  employers.
                  Multiple Entry Work Permit (MEWP) holders and Training and
                  Work Experience Schemes (TWES) work permit holders are not
                  permitted to take up supplementary employment.


             (e)  must be produced intact, together with a  valid  passport
                  or   other   identity   documentation,   endorsed    where
                  appropriate  with  a  United  Kingdom   visa,   or   entry
                  clearance, to the  Immigration  Officer  at  the  port  of
                  arrival in the United Kingdom by the person named thereon.
                   Thereafter, it should be carefully preserved, with  their
                  passport, by the holder for presentation to the  competent
                  authorities as and when necessary ...".

13.  The Home Office's Border & Immigration Agency has published a  document
    entitled "WORK  PERMITS  -  BUSINESS  AND  COMMERCIAL  -  Guidance  for
    Employers 19 November  2007  -  13  March  2008".   Under  the  heading
    "Section 5 - Immigration", we find:-

         "184.    If the person needs a visa, or any  other  form  of  entry
                clearance  they  must  apply  to   their   nearest   British
                diplomatic post in their country  of  residence  within  six
                months from the date of issue of the work permit.


         ...


         186. The original permit must  be  produced  to  support  the  visa
                application (photocopies are not  usually  accepted).   Work
                permits are valid for six months  from  the  date  we  issue
                them."

14.  Under "Section 6 - Frequently Asked Questions", the guide  explains  in
    what circumstances a  reprint  of  a  work  permit  can  be  requested.
    Amongst the circumstances specified are the following:-

         "Requesting reprints of work permits Issued over six months ago.


         219. Reprints of work permits issued over 6 months ago will be free
                of  charge,  provided  that  the  original  work  permit  is
                returned and all other conditions, as  outlined  below,  are
                met.  If it is not returned then a fresh  application,  with
                fee, will be required.  Reprinting  work  permits  that  are
                over 6 months old will apply in the following  circumstances
                only:




         Where there has been a delay in obtaining entry clearance.


         220. You should provide evidence of the delay in this circumstance,
                i.e. a written notice from the visa section,  of  the  entry
                clearance interview date and, submit your request  no  later
                than one month after the date of interview.   The  Border  &
                Immigration  Agency  reserves  the  right  to  confirm   the
                genuineness of evidence provided.  This may involve  a  pre-
                issue compliance check.  If  you  do  not  submit  a  timely
                application or provide evidence of delay your  request  will
                be refused and you  will  be  required  to  submit  a  fresh
                application enclosing the fee.


         Where delays arise from overseas nationals' appeals  against  Entry
         Clearance Officers' decisions not to grant leave to enter the UK.


         221. You should provide evidence of the delay in this  circumstance
                i.e. a copy of the Appeals (sic)  and  Immigration  Tribunal
                (AIT) appeal determination letter and  submit  your  request
                normally within six months of the date of  the  AIT  letter.
                You should send a copy of the letter with your request.


         222. Once the appeal decision is known, the original  employer  (or
                their representative) should request a reprint  as  soon  as
                possible.  You should not wait  for  the  individual  to  be
                invited for interview by the ECO or to find out if  the  ECO
                will appeal against the appeal decision before requesting  a
                reprint.


         223. Requests submitted more than 6 months after the  date  of  the
                AIT letter will only be considered if you can demonstrate an
                acceptable reason for the delay.


         224. The Border & Immigration Agency reserves the right to  confirm
                the genuineness of evidence you provide.  This could involve
                a pre-issue compliance check.  If you do not submit a timely
                application or provide evidence of delay, your request  will
                be refused and you  will  be  required  to  submit  a  fresh
                application, enclosing the fee."

15.  The issue of whether there was a  valid  appeal  to  the  Tribunal  was
    raised by the Presenting Officer at the hearing before the  Immigration
    Judge.  Having heard submissions, the Immigration  Judge  concluded  as
    follows:-

         "6.  I made the following decision.   The  Appellant  sought  entry
             clearance in compliance with paragraph  184  of  the  guidance
             notes.  The work permit has now expired.  It is plain from the
             work  permit  section  of  the  Border  &  Immigration  Agency
             guidance rules that a work permit will  be  reprinted  or  re-
             issued.  It is not  necessary  to  apply  afresh  for  a  work
             permit.  This is subject to compliance with  showing  evidence
             of delay.  Section 88(2)(b) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
             and  Asylum  Act  2002  requires  the  Appellant  to  have  an
             immigration document of a particular kind or  any  immigration
             document.  Clearly a work  permit  which  is  dead  would  not
             constitute such a document.  The issuing authority has however
             by its approach conferred  the  status  on  the  expired  work
             permit of simply rendering it dormant since it can be  revived
             in the form  of  being  reprinted  if  evidence  of  delay  is
             provided  and  accepted.   The  Appellant  therefore  was   in
             possession of a document in the form of an expired work permit
             at  the  time  of  the  appeal.   This  was  a   document   of
             potentiality in that it can be reprinted.   It  represented  a
             dormant position not one which had expired  completely.   Thus
             Section  88(2)(b)  is  satisfied  as  the  Appellant  had   an
             immigration document of a particular kind or  any  immigration
             document.  An ex-post facto decision not to reprint  does  not
             alter the current dormant status of the expired  work  permit.
             In the alternative I apply a purposive construction in holding
             that the duality of the system involving  work  permits  being
             granted and entry clearance requirements being  satisfied  may
             well  involve  a  chronological  difficulty  and   without   a
             purposive construction an appeal could not proceed.


         13.  ... I find that the expired work permit which was held by  the
             Appellant at the date of the decision to refuse is in  fact  a
             dormant document capable of revival in the form of  reprinting
             or re-issue.  It is not a deceased document.  It is capable of
             revival.  As such it remains a  document.   This  is  what  is
             required  for  the  purposes  of  launching  an  appeal.   The
             guidance notes attached to the  file  illustrate  the  process
             which must be undergone to achieve revival.   Conditions  must
             be met.  Even if those conditions as described are not met  an
             ex-post facto decision by WPUK not to revive the  expired  but
             dormant work document cannot alter the status of the  document
             at the time  of  this  appeal.   The  guidance  notes  clearly
             demonstrate the procedure for reviving the expired work permit
             by bringing about its reprinting or re-issue and this document
             will be presented to the Immigration Officer at  the  port  of
             arrival.  It will be necessary for this to take  place  within
             six months of issue or of re-issue or reprinting.  If this  in
             fact is an incorrect interpretation of the Rule referred to by
             the respondent the entire  approach  adopted  by  WPUK  is  in
             error.  That would be extraordinary.  I do not find that  that
             is the case.  All the matters raised by  the  Respondent  have
             been resolved.  All the requirements of the Rules are met".

16.  The last two sentences of paragraph  13  of  the  determination  are  a
    reference to the Immigration Judge having found, on the evidence before
    him, that the proposed employer would be  in  a  position  to  pay  the
    appellant the stated salary of �20,000 per annum.

17.   I consider that the Immigration Judge was wrong in  law  to  interpret
    section 88(2)(b) of the 2002 Act as he did.   The  Immigration  Judge's
    attention does not appear to have been drawn to the definition of "work
    permit" in section 33(1) of the 1971 Act (paragraph 11  above).   There
    we find that a work permit is a permit indicating that a  person  named
    in it is eligible (my emphasis) for entry into the United  Kingdom  for
    the purpose of taking employment.  As at the date  of  the  immigration
    decision in this case, it was manifest that the work permit had  ceased
    to be valid.  It was  still  in  India,  in  the  hands  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer and had not been "produced to the Immigration Officer
    at the port of arrival in the United Kingdom within six months  of  the
    date of issue" (condition 3(c); paragraph  12  above).   In  order  for
    something to be a work permit within the meaning of section  33(1),  it
    must be capable of conferring on its holder eligibility  for  entry  to
    the United Kingdom.  If it does not do so, at the time  when  it  falls
    for consideration (here, the date of the decision by  the  respondent),
    then it is not an immigration document  for  the  purposes  of  section
    88(2)(b) of the 2002 Act.

18.    The Immigration Judge's reliance on what might be called the  concept
    of dormancy was, I find, misplaced. As can be seen  from  the  extracts
    from  the  guidance  notes,  there  are  conditions  attached  to   the
    reprinting of a work permit, which the holder may or may not be able to
    satisfy. The logic of the Immigration Judge's position would mean  that
    at least some kinds of invalid passport or equivalent  documents  would
    be sufficient for the purposes of section 88(3)(b) and (d).  It  cannot
    have been the intention of Parliament, so to restrict the operation  of
    section 88 as to confer rights of appeal on persons  producing  expired
    or otherwise invalid passports. To dilute the test of what  constitutes
    a valid document in the way envisaged by the Immigration  Judge  would,
    for example, lead to an assertion that a  foreign  passport  which  had
    expired was merely "dormant" because, according  to  the  laws  of  the
    country concerned, it might be revived by some  future  action  on  the
    part of its holder. Such a  construction  would  place  an  unwarranted
    burden on the system of United Kingdom immigration controls.

19.    I am reinforced in this view  by  the  recent  determination  of  the
    Tribunal in MC (s 88: meaning of  "a  passport")  [2008]  UKAIT  00030,
    where,  in  relation  to  an  application  for  entry  clearance,   the
    expression "a passport" in section 88(3)(b) was held to  mean  a  valid
    passport satisfactorily establishing the holder's identity.

20.  In the present case, the Immigration Judge's reliance  on  the  concept
    of dormancy leads to the following further difficulty.  Given that  the
    Immigration Judge purported to allow the appeal outright, he must  have
    been  satisfied  that  the  requirement  of  paragraph  128(i)  of  the
    Immigration Rules was met, as at the date of decision; that is to  say,
    that the appellant held a valid work permit.  But, if that is so,  then
    it is difficult to see how the appellant could ever be expected to "re-
    awaken" his dormant work permit by obtaining a reprint of it.   Indeed,
    rather than seek such a reprint, and be refused, which the  Immigration
    Judge apparently considered would terminate the dormant status  of  the
    work permit, a person in the position of the appellant would need to do
    nothing at all to regularise his position.

21.   The  Immigration  Judge  appeared  to  consider   that,   unless   his
    construction of the relevant legislation, or at  least  something  like
    it, was  adopted,  the  procedure  for  obtaining  entry  clearance  by
    reference to a work permit would be unworkable.  That, however, is  not
    the case.  On the contrary, paragraphs  219  to  224  of  the  guidance
    document provide mechanisms that are designed precisely to ensure  that
    the systems of work permits and entry clearance can  operate  together.
    The Immigration Judge placed undue emphasis upon paragraph 184  of  the
    guidance, which states that a person who needs a visa should apply  for
    entry clearance within six months from the date of issue  of  the  work
    permit.  In the present case, the chronology shows that  the  appellant
    made his latest application for entry clearance only nine  days  before
    his work permit expired.  In  the  nature  of  things,  the  respondent
    cannot possibly be criticised for failing to reach a  decision  on  the
    application within nine days.  On the contrary, the sensible course for
    the appellant would have been to have waited until the work permit  had
    expired and then sought a reprint in pursuance of paragraph 220 of  the
    guidance, citing the delay in obtaining entry clearance that  had  been
    occasioned, not by any tardiness on the respondent's part,  but  wholly
    or mainly because the appellant had seen fit to make  an  earlier  work
    permit entry clearance application,  which  he  acknowledged  had  been
    doomed to failure.  In his application of 11 May  2007,  the  appellant
    stated:-

         "The ECO was correct in his [earlier] decision, because we had not
         provided with any documents of support for  our  accommodation  and
         maintenance by my sister.  In order to rectify our mistake, we have
         decided to make new application".

22.  In the circumstances, therefore, the Immigration  Judge  was  wrong  to
    consider that, whether by reference to the appellant's  application  or
    more  generally,  he  was  required  to  adopt  a  highly   problematic
    interpretation of the relevant legislation, in order to do justice.  In
    this regard, it is relevant to record that Ms White helpfully  informed
    me on 19 March 2008 that the appellant has apparently  now  obtained  a
    new, valid work permit.

23.  The Immigration Judge made a material error of law  and  I  accordingly
    substitute for his decision, a decision of my own, formally  dismissing
    the appeal for want of jurisdiction.
