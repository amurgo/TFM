                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                   Appellant

                         (anonymity direction made)
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:           Ms Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Sachdev, Bury Law Centre


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Nigeria. She is an overstayer  who  has
    been living in the United Kingdom for at least 14 years.  On  the  22nd
    December 2016 the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Bircher)  allowed  her
    appeal on human rights grounds, principally because of the presence  in
    the UK of the Respondent's children, aged 3 and 7 at the  date  of  the
    hearing. The Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  now  has
    permission to appeal against that decision.




    Anonymity Order


 2. There is no reason why the identity of SA should be protected.    I  am
    however concerned that publicly  identifying  her  could  lead  to  the
    identification of her children. Having had regard to  Rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  and  the  Presidential
    Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders I consider it  appropriate
    to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Respondent is granted anonymity.  No report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"






    The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal


 3. The case before the First-tier Tribunal was that SA had been trafficked
    to the United Kingdom when she was aged just 16, entering  the  country
    at some point in 1996 and being held in a situation of forced  domestic
    labour. She had eventually escaped, met the father of the children  and
    established her own private and family life in the UK. She averred that
    she could  not  return  to  Nigeria  because  she  was  afraid  of  her
    traffickers, she no longer had any ties there  and  her  children  were
    settled in this country to the extent that it would not  be  reasonable
    to expect them to leave.


 4. In a careful and reasoned decision the First-tier Tribunal rejected the
    account of trafficking. It did not accept that SA had  been  living  in
    this country since 1996, although it was satisfied, having  had  regard
    to documentary evidence, that she has been here since  at  least  2004.
    The Tribunal did not accept that she had lost all ties  to  Nigeria  or
    that there were significant obstacles to  her  integration  there.   SA
    could not therefore hope to qualify  for  leave  to  remain  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  Turning to Article 8 'outside  of  the  rules'  the
    Tribunal directed itself that the best interests of the children  were,
    in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court in  ZH  (Tanzania)
    UKSC 4, a 'primary consideration'.   It found that both  children,  but
    particularly the eldest, were settled in this country and that they had
    formed ties outside of the home.  The  eldest  child  is  for  instance
    described as "an asset" to his school. They both maintain contact  with
    their  father,  who  lives  here  (albeit  with  uncertain  immigration
    status). It would be a struggle for them to adapt to life  in  Nigeria.
    The only life they have ever known is life in this country. Having made
    those findings the determination goes on to address the public interest
    factors set out in s117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002. It is noted that the SA speaks "excellent" English and  that  she
    is financially independent.  She did however enter the UK illegally and
    her immigration status has always been  precarious.  The  determination
    concludes:


         "On balance and in particular because of the lengthy period of time
         which her eldest child  in  particular  has  spent  in  the  UK,  I
         conclude that a refusal  of  the  appellant's  appeal  would  be  a
         disproportionate interference with Article 8 rights  and  therefore
         unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998".


 5. The appeal was thereby allowed.




    The Challenge


 6. The Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  contends  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal is flawed for the following  errors
    of law:


   i) The eldest child had been only 4 at the date that the application  had
      been made. He could not therefore qualify for leave under the relevant
      rule (276ADE) and the appeal  could  only  be  allowed  on  Article  8
      grounds if there  were  "compelling  circumstances"  warranting  leave
      outside of the rules;


  ii) The fact that the child had been here for 7 years could not constitute
      "compelling circumstances";


 iii) Given that the child had only been here for 4 years  at  the  date  of
      application the Tribunal should have had regard to  the  dicta  in  EV
      (Philippines) [2014] EWCA Civ 874 regarding  the  public  interest  in
      removing persons who have no right to remain;


  iv) The ultimate     question is whether it is reasonable  to  expect  the
      child to leave the UK, in accordance with section 117B(6) of the  2002
      Act. The determination does not address that test;


   v) In answering that question the Tribunal was obliged to have regard  to
      the public interest: MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705.




    The Response


 7. Ms Sachdev pointed out that the determination sets out in great detail,
    and at some length, the reasons it gave for rejecting SA's  trafficking
    claims.  It  plainly  recognised  that  she  had  entered  the  country
    unlawfully and that she has no right to remain  in  this  country.  The
    Tribunal expressly addresses the public interest factors in  s117B  and
    weighs them in the balance against the best interests of the  children,
    and in particular the eldest, who met the definition of  a  "qualifying
    child" as per s117D of the 2002 Act.  Given the terms of the  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department's own policy it was difficult  to  see
    how the decision would have been otherwise.






    My Findings


 8. The grounds of appeal reflect the somewhat tortuous route of Article  8
    jurisprudence in the UK since the 1998 Act.  The Secretary of State for
    the  Home  Department  invokes  the  concepts  of  exceptionality   and
    "compelling  circumstances"  to  contend   that   there   was   nothing
    exceptional or compelling about a mother who is  an  overstayer  having
    some children.  Neither of these phrases has ever imported a legal test
    into the consideration of proportionality; where they have been used by
    the higher courts it has been simply to underline the expectation  that
    most cases which fail under the Rules are unlikely to succeed on  human
    rights grounds. It was ever thus.   The phrases were only ever intended
    to emphasise the importance to be placed  on  the  public  interest  in
    controlling immigration.  Their  significance  has  now  rather  fallen
    away,  give  the  introduction  of   the   codified   public   interest
    considerations that now appear in ss117A-D of the 2002 Act (as  amended
    by the Immigration Act 2014), in particular in  s117B.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal of this chamber is now required to have regard to the  factors
    set out at s117B (1)-(6) in its assessment of  proportionality.  Having
    done that it does not need to go on to identify some  "exceptional"  or
    "compelling" feature of the case. If the case  has  engaged  Article  8
    (i.e. the  first  two  Razgar  questions  have  been  answered  in  the
    affirmative)  and  the  balancing  exercise  tips   in   the   notional
    appellant's favour, the case will be, by definition, exceptional.    To
    that extent the first four  paragraphs  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    grounds are misconceived.  Insofar as the grounds might be read to take
    issue with the decision of the Tribunal to consider Article 8  at  all,
    it is of  course  the  case  that  Nagre  [2013]  EWHC  720,  the  case
    specifically invoked in the grounds, was never intended to introduce  a
    'two-stage' test. It is plain on the facts, and indeed having regard to
    the Rules (276ADE(1)(iv)) and statute (s117B(6)) that interference with
    the private life of a  qualifying  child  was  plainly  a  matter  that
    engaged Article 8. I can find no error in the  Tribunal's  decision  to
    consider  the  child's  human  rights  outwith  the  framework  of  the
    Immigration Rules.


 9. Paragraph 5 contends that the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    contrary  to  that  in  EV  (Philippines).    In  that  case  an  adult
    overstayer sought to resist removal with reference to the  presence  in
    the UK of her four year old child and  the  fact  that  the  child  had
    started school here. The Court rightly held that in those circumstances
    any private life that the child had developed would be nascent and that
    in all the circumstances  her  removal  with  her  mother  would  be  a
    proportionate response to the need  to  maintain  immigration  control.
    The present case was an in-country  human  rights  appeal  involving  a
    child who was over 7 years old. This set it apart from EV (Philippines)
    for  two  important  legal  reasons.  First,  the  terms  of   statute.
    Parliament has specifically legislated that a child who has spent seven
    continuous years in the UK is "qualifying", a term intended to  reflect
    the likelihood that the child will have a very well  developed  private
    life in this country; I note that the other way in which a child can be
    "qualified" is by being British.  Second, the terms of the Secretary of
    State's own  policy.   In  the  Immigration  Directorates'  Instruction
    'Family Migration: Appendix FM Section 1.0b Family Life (as  a  Partner
    or Parent) and Private Life: 10-Year Routes' Home Office caseowners are
    instructed as follows:
         11.2.4. Would it be unreasonable to expect a non-British Citizen
         child to leave the UK?
         The requirement that a non-British Citizen child has lived in the
         UK for a continuous period of at least the 7 years immediately
         preceding the date of application, recognises that over time
         children start to put down roots and integrate into life in the UK,
         to the extent that being required to leave the UK may be
         unreasonable. The longer the child has resided in the UK, the more
         the balance will begin to swing in terms of it being unreasonable
         to expect the child to leave the UK, and strong reasons will be
         required in order to refuse a case with continuous UK residence of
         more than 7 years.
         The decision maker must consider whether, in the specific
         circumstances of the case, it would be reasonable to expect the
         child to live in another country.
         The decision maker must consider the facts relating to each child
         in the UK in the family individually, and also consider all the
         facts relating to the family as a whole. The decision maker should
         also engage with any specific issues explicitly raised by the
         family, by each child or on behalf of each child.
    (emphasis added)


10. That guidance has its origins in  long-standing  government  policy  to
    allow children who had accrued seven years'  long  residence  to  stay,
    absent countervailing factors.  Policies  such  as  DP3/93  and  DP5/96
    created a general, but rebuttable, presumption that enforcement  action
    would "not normally" proceed in cases where a child was born  here  and
    had lived continuously to the age of 7 or over, or where,  having  come
    to the United Kingdom at an  early  age,  7  years  or  more  had  been
    accumulated[1]. Although there have been shifts and amendments to  this
    policy over the years, the government has consistently maintained  that
    a residence of at least 7 years' duration is a  significant  benchmark.
    As the  policy  statement[2]  which  accompanied  the  introduction  of
    paragraph 276ADE (1)(iv) puts it: "a period of 7 continuous years spent
    in the UK as a child will generally establish  a  sufficient  level  of
    integration for family and private life  to  exist  such  that  removal
    would normally  not  be  in  the  best  interests  of  the  child"  [my
    emphasis].    See  for  instance  these  remarks  by  Lord  Wallace  of
    Tankerness made in the debate on the introduction of the 2014 Act:


         "we have acknowledged that if a child has reached the age of seven,
         he or she will have moved beyond simply having his or her needs met
         by the parents. The child will be part of the education system  and
         may be  developing  social  networks  and  connections  beyond  the
         parents and home. However, a child who has not spent seven years in
         the United Kingdom either will be  relatively  young  and  able  to
         adapt, or if they are older, will be likely  to  have  spent  their
         earlier years in their country of origin or another  country.  When
         considering  the  best  interests  of  the  child,  the   fact   of
         citizenship is important but so is the  fact  that  the  child  has
         spent  a  large  part  of  his  or  her  childhood  in  the  United
         Kingdom"[3].


11. There was therefore no error in the  Tribunal  failing  to  follow  the
    principles - or outcome - in EV (Phillipines).


12. As Ms Pettersen rightly acknowledged, the crux of this  appeal  is  the
    Tribunal's failure  to  direct  itself  to  the  test  in  s117B(6)(b).
    Although it made express findings about the first limb of the provision
    [at �80],   and it does reach a clear  proportionality  conclusion  [at
    �81-82] the  Tribunal  has  nowhere  employed  the  word  "reasonable".
    This, she submitted, demonstrates an error in approach  such  that  the
    decision should be set aside.


13. Section 117B reads:


         Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases:


         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
         public interest.




         (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

         (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

         (b) are better able to integrate into society.




         (3)  It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
         financially independent, because such persons-

         (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

         (b) are better able to integrate into society.




         (4) Little weight should be given to-

         (a) a private life, or

         (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.




         (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by
         a person at a time when the person's immigration status is
         precarious.




         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

         (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
         with a qualifying child, and

          (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
         United Kingdom.


14. In Treebhowan [2015] UKUT 674 the President of this Tribunal Mr Justice
    McCloskey held that s117B(6) was of a different nature from the  public
    interest factors set out in ss(1)-(5). It  is  expressed  in  mandatory
    terms so that if both limbs (a) and (b) are satisfied,  the  result  is
    that it would be disproportionate to remove the appellant in  question.
    The decision on whether it would be reasonable for the qualifying child
    to leave the  country  therefore  assumed  great  significance  in  the
    deliberations.  In MA  (Pakistan)  the  Court  of  Appeal  agreed  that
    s117B(6) was capable of  being  determinative  in  the  proportionality
    balancing exercise.  It  did  not  however  agree  with  the  way  that
    McCloskey  J  had  approached  the  question  of   reasonableness.   In
    Treebhowan (and other decisions) the President had placed  considerable
    emphasis on the welfare of the child. In MA Elias LJ  accepted,  albeit
    reluctantly, that the evaluation must include a balancing of the public
    interest against those 'best interest' factors.   These  included,  but
    are not limited to, the matters referred to at ss(1)-(5).  The test  of
    'reasonableness'  in  effect  becomes  the  proportionality   balancing
    exercise.   In  those  circumstances  the  failure  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in this case to use the word 'reasonable', and instead to  use
    the term 'proportionate' is hardly material.   The  Tribunal  considers
    first the 'best interest' factors. It specifically has  regard  to  the
    private life of the child with long residence - the  qualifying  child.
    It then has express regard to  the  public  interest  factors,  and  in
    particular the fact that SA has no leave to remain in the UK, and never
    has.   I do not think it appropriate to interfere with that approach.


15. If I am wrong, and the decision is fatally flawed for the  omission  of
    the word 'reasonable', I  would  remake  the  decision  with  the  same
    outcome.   In MA the Court of Appeal endorsed the approach taken by the
    Respondent in her own published  guidance  on  these  issues  (as  this
    Tribunal did in PD and Others (Article 8  -  conjoined  family  claims)
    [2016] UKUT 108).  That guidance, cited above,   recognises that  after
    a period of seven years' residence a  child  will  have  forged  strong
    links with the UK to the extent that he or she will have an established
    private life outside of  the  immediate  embrace  of  his  parents  and
    siblings, (a point specifically recognised  by  the  Tribunal  in  this
    case). It is that private life which should be the  starting  point  of
    consideration under this Rule. The relationships and  understanding  of
    life that a child develops as he  grows  older  are  matters  which  in
    themselves attract weight. The fact that the child  might  be  able  to
    adapt to  life  elsewhere  is  a  relevant  factor  but  it  cannot  be
    determinative, since exclusive focus on that question would obscure the
    fact that for such a child, his private life in the UK is everything he
    knows.  It will normally be contrary to the child's best  interests  to
    interfere with that private life. That is the starting point,  and  the
    task of the Tribunal is  to  then  look  to  other  factors  to  decide
    whether, on the particular  facts  of  this  case,  these  displace  or
    outweigh the presumption in favour of granting  leave.   Those  factors
    are wide-ranging and varied. The IDI gives several examples  including,
    for instance, the child's health, whether his parents have  leave,  the
    extent of family connections to the country of proposed return; whether
    criminality on the part of the parent could justify a refusal of leave.
     The assessment of what is "reasonable" calls for the Tribunal to weigh
    all of  these  matters  into  the  balance  and  to  see  whether  they
    constitute "strong reasons" - the language of the  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department - to proceed with removal  notwithstanding  the
    established Article 8 rights of the child in the UK. This  policy,  and
    those which preceded it, must form the basis of  any  consideration  of
    this Rule. As Elias LJ puts it at paragraph 46 of MA:


         "Even on the approach of the Secretary of State, the  fact  that  a
         child has been here for  seven  years  must  be  given  significant
         weight when carrying out the proportionality exercise. Indeed,  the
         Secretary of State published guidance in August 2015 in the form of
         Immigration Directorate Instructions entitled "Family  Life  (as  a
         partner or parent) and Private Life: 10 Year Routes" in which it is
         expressly stated that once the seven years'  residence  requirement
         is satisfied, there need to be "strong reasons" for refusing  leave
         (para. 11.2.4). These instructions were not in force when the cases
         now subject to appeal were determined, but in my view  they  merely
         confirm what is implicit in adopting a policy of this nature. After
         such a period of time the  child  will  have  put  down  roots  and
         developed social, cultural and educational links  in  the  UK  such
         that it is likely to be highly disruptive if the child is  required
         to leave the UK. That may be less so when  the  children  are  very
         young because the focus of their lives will be on  their  families,
         but  the  disruption  becomes  more  serious  as  they  get  older.
         Moreover, in these cases there must be a  very  strong  expectation
         that the child's best interests will be to remain in  the  UK  with
         his parents as part of a family unit,  and  that  must  rank  as  a
         primary consideration in the proportionality assessment".


16. In this case the countervailing factor was the fact  that  the  child's
    mother is an illegal entrant. As Ms Pettersen accepted, it is  implicit
    in the operation of s117B(6) that the parent facing  removal  will  not
    have leave to remain in this country; if she  did  there  would  be  no
    consideration of the Rule. For that reason I am not satisfied that  the
    lack of status simpliciter would be capable of constituting the "strong
    reasons" discussed in the policy.  The findings of fact  in  this  case
    are that the child in question has no connection to Nigeria apart  from
    his mother, who has herself been out of that country for a  long  time.
    He would "struggle" to adjust to life there. By contrast he has  strong
    links to this country: his friends, school, home  and  father  are  all
    here. Were I remaking this decision  I  would  be  unable  to  identify
    strong reasons why it would be reasonable to expect this child  to  now
    leave the UK and I too would allow the appeal.




    Decision


17. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an  error
    of law such that it must be set aside.


18. There is an order for anonymity.
