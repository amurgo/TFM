Representation
For the Appellants:    Mr S Karim, counsel instructed by Thamina Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Brocklesby-Weller, Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants are nationals of Bangladesh. The  first  two  appellants
    are the parents of the third and fourth  appellants.  Their  respective
    dates of birth are [ ] 1972; [ ] 1976; [ ] 2007 and [ ] 2011.

 2. The appellants appeal with  permission  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent dated 27 November 2015 refusing their applications for leave
    to remain in the UK on human rights grounds.

 3. The background to the appeal as set out in  the  reasons  for  decision
    notice is as follows.

 4. The first appellant entered the UK on 7 September 2005 as a student. He
    was granted further leave to remain on  several  occasions  after  that
    until 30 November 2010.  On 6 September 2010 he made an application for
    leave to remain as a highly skilled post study worker which was granted
    until 17 September 2012.

 5. In 2009 the second and third appellants entered the  UK  as  dependants
    and were granted leave in line with the first appellant.

 6. The mother and children returned to Bangladesh in 2011 and returned  to
    the UK in 2012.

 7. On 12 September 2012 the first appellant made an application for  leave
    to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) and the others as his  dependants.
    Those applications were refused on  7  March  2013.  Their  appeal  was
    allowed to the limited extent  that  the  respondent  was  required  to
    reconsider the Tier 1 application.

 8. On 4  February  2014  the  respondent  refused  the  first  appellant's
    application as well as those of his dependants. They were refused under
    paragraph 322(1A) of the Rules on the basis that false  documents  were
    submitted in relation to the first appellant's  third  party  sponsor's
    bank account. His subsequent appeal was dismissed on 11 February 2015.

 9. The appellants then applied for leave  to  remain  on  the  grounds  of
    family and private life on 27 July 2015 which was refused on 7  October
    2015.

10. On  17  August  2015  the  first  appellant  made  an  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain on the basis of ten years' lawful residence.
    The dependants made applications at the same time.

11. His application was refused on  27  November  2015  and  the  remaining
    appellants' applications were refused on 24 December 2015.

12. Their appeal against that decision was  heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Dean on 21 February 2017 on the basis  of  ten  years  continuous
    lawful residence and  on  human  rights  grounds  [8].  Paragraph  276D
    requires that the appellant must have at least  ten  years'  continuous
    lawful residence in the UK and having regard  to  the  public  interest
    there are no reasons why it would be undesirable for the  appellant  to
    be given indefinite leave to remain on the grounds of  long  residence,
    taking into account, inter alia, personal history including  character,
    conduct, associations and employment records.

13. Judge Dean found that the first appellant had not met the  requirements
    under  paragraph  276D(ii)(c).  The  starting  point  was  the  earlier
    decision of Judge Plumptre dated 11 February 2015 who  found  that  the
    first appellant submitted false documents.  She  heard  'new  evidence'
    from Mr Rahman. She found his account implausible and it undermined the
    veracity of his account of the facts [20].

14. Judge Dean had regard to Judge Plumptre's decision and  found  that  it
    left no doubt that he submitted false documents and  that  the  refusal
    under paragraph 322(1A)  was  correct.   She  upheld  the  respondent's
    decision to refuse the  application  under  paragraph  322(2),  as  the
    appellant  had  submitted  false  documents  in  an  earlier   Tier   1
    application [23].  She the found that he did not meet  the  requirement
    under paragraph 276B(ii)(c) and his ILR appeal failed.  His  dependants
    fell in line with that finding [24].

15. She went on to consider family and private life.  The  appellants  made
    their current applications on 17 August 2015. The third  appellant  had
    not lived in the UK continuously for seven years  as  at  the  date  of
    application. In relation to the first and second appellants,  EX.1  did
    not apply [28].

16. With regard to private life under  paragraph  276ADE,  she  found  that
    there were not very significant  obstacles  to  the  first  and  second
    appellants' re-integration in Bangladesh [30].

17. She found with regard to the third appellant, that she had lived in the
    UK continuously for two years and two months. She was under the 18  and
    had not lived continuously for seven  years  in  the  UK.  Accordingly,
    paragraph 276ADE(iv) does not apply and her appeal fails [31].

18. Judge Dean found that the fourth appellant entered the UK  on  13  June
    2016 and her appeal under paragraph 276ADE also failed [32].

19. She  considered  the  appeal  under  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
    Convention. In assessing the evidence in the round, she found that  the
    reasons for dismissal of the first appellant's appeal did  not  provide
    compelling circumstances  which  would  give  rise  to  the  legitimate
    expectation of ILR as the appellants were only ever here on a temporary
    basis. This was a situation of a student whose family came  to  the  UK
    having no expectation of being able to remain  on  a  permanent  basis.
    Their  applications  and  appeals  have  been  fully   considered   and
    determined. There was nothing in a  factual  matrix  which  established
    compelling circumstances to consider their appeals under the provisions
    of Article 8 [36].

20. On 25 October 2017 Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce noted that  Judge  Dean's
    determination prima  facie  contained  a  careful  examination  of  the
    evidence with regard to the false documents. It  was  however  arguable
    that the evaluation did not extend to addressing the main  points  made
    by the appellant on the issue, as set out in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the
    grounds.

21. She found that it was arguable that the Tribunal had  not  conducted  a
    "best interests assessment". The analysis appeared to be  consigned  to
    assessing the first limb of paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv). Judge Bruce stated
    that whether that area is material may be doubtful in the light of  the
    guidance in EV (Philippines) [2014] EWCA Civ 874.

Error of law hearing

22. Mr Karim, who did not represent the appellants  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, submitted that Judge  Dean  had  failed  to  have  regard  to
    relevant  evidence  before  making   negative   credibility   findings,
    particularly in respect of the evidence of Mr Rahman and the  appellant
    at [16-24].

23. He referred to the email  chain  at  pages  44-45  of  the  appellants'
    bundle. It appears that the  respondent  asked  the  bank  whether  the
    customer has or has ever had �21,094.54 in his account on  10  December
    2013. However, the bank should have been looking  at  9  December  2013
    which was what the letter of 10 December 2013 was  purporting  to  deal
    with. He submitted that it is plausible that the writer  of  the  email
    from the bank which formed the basis of the allegation of fraud, failed
    to realise that deducting the amount of �26.94 from  �21,121.48  (which
    was the closing balance on the  Santander  receipt  at  page  46)  left
    �21,094.54 which was the amount claimed. It  would  make  no  sense  to
    perpetrate the fraud alleged because there was in fact  more  money  in
    the account than claimed.

24. He submitted that the Judge should have looked at all the  evidence  in
    the round which undermined the respondent's allegation of fraud.

25. With regard to ground  2,  he  submitted  that  Judge  Dean  showed  no
    engagement with s.55 in respect of the two children. He referred to the
    findings at [28]. Since 2012 the third appellant child had lived in the
    UK continuously.

26. He referred to the judgment of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  R  (on  the
    application of M) Lebanon v SSHD [2017]  UKSC  10  at  paragraph  [92].
    There the Court held that s.55 of the 2009 Act stands on its  own  feet
    as a statutory requirement apart from HRA or the Convention. It applies
    to the performance  of  any  of  the  secretary  of  state's  functions
    including the making of the rules. While the detailed guidance  may  be
    given by instructions, it should be clear  from  the  rules  themselves
    that the statutory duty has been properly taken into account.  In  that
    respect, it was declared that  both  the  rules  and  instructions  are
    unlawful.

27. He also referred to  the  recent  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  in
    Makhlouf v SSHD [2016] UKSC 59 at [46-47].  Lady  Hale  in  a  separate
    judgment stated at [47] that the best interests  of  children  must  be
    treated as a primary consideration and considered separately  from  the
    adults and from the public interest. The duty stems first from s.55  of
    the 2009 Act. Even without that section, s.6(1) of the Human Rights Act
    1998 requires public authorities to  act  compatibly  with  the  rights
    contained in the European Convention on  Human  Rights,  including  the
    right to respect for family life contained in Article 8. This has  been
    interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights to include  the  duty
    in Article 3(1) of the United  Nations  Convention.  Children  must  be
    recognised as rights holders in their own rights and  not  just  as  an
    adjunct to other people's rights. That does not however mean that their
    rights are inevitably a passport to another person's rights [47].

28. On behalf of the respondent, Ms Brocklesby-Weller referred to paragraph
    [3] of Judge Dean's decision. It was noted that the bundle of documents
    included a copy of the determination of Judge Plumtre dated 11 February
    2015 relating to a previous appeal by the appellants. There was also  a
    witness statement signed by Mr [MH] Rahman dated 9 February 2017.

29. She submitted that the Judge had proper regard  to  the  principles  in
    Deevaseelan at [12]. She noted that it was submitted on behalf  of  the
    appellants that the third party sponsor was not a witness before  Judge
    Plumtre.

30. This was in the form of Mr [ ]  Rahman's  witness  statement  and  oral
    evidence which, it was asserted, provided a  comprehensive  explanation
    as to the problems of the Santander documents which enabled her  to  go
    behind the adverse credibility findings of Judge Plumtre.

31. Judge Dean considered this evidence in the round and found that it  did
    not advance the first appellant's claim  that  this  was  not  a  false
    document. It was firstly on the basis that the email from the Santander
    fraud department stated that at no  time  did  the  balance  match  the
    amounts stipulated in the letter. Further, she found that  Mr  Rahman's
    account of going to various branches before finally persuading  someone
    at the Watney Market Town branch of Santander did not have the ring  of
    truth because had  the  employee  been  so  persuaded  she  would  have
    recorded an accurate balance, but the fraud department stated that  the
    account had at no time had the stipulated sums [18].

32. It was submitted that she had the benefit  of  hearing  and  seeing  Mr
    Rahman when he was  cross  examined.  She  also  had  regard  to  other
    features in the evidence from Mr Rahman, including the Santander letter
    dated 10 December 2013. She had regard to the analysis of the  evidence
    at [20 -21]. She found at [21] that Mr Rahman was unable to provide any
    answer as to what had happened to the amount of money which was claimed
    to have been in his account, namely  �21,094.54.  That  undermined  the
    veracity of his account on the facts [21].

33. She submitted that a proper approach was therefore taken by  the  Judge
    with regard to the first ground of appeal.

34. With regard to ground 2, the third appellant arrived in the UK in 2009.
    She went back to Bangladesh in 2011 and only  returned  in  2012.   The
    Judge correctly found  that  she  could  not  succeed  under  paragraph
    276(1)(ADE) of the rules. There was no reason why the parents could not
    return to Bangladesh. They are integrated into Bangladesh.

35. The third appellant was only two when she came to the UK in 2009.  When
    the application was made she had only lived in the UK continuously  for
    three years and two months. That was the factual matrix  against  which
    the best interests of the children had to be assessed.

36. She referred to the first appellant's witness statement at page 34.  It
    was noted that his wife and children arrived in 2012 and they have also
    developed strong links with the UK, with the "eldest  child"  being  in
    full time education.

37. The children have formed strong ties of their own  with  this  country.
    They  have  immersed  well  with  society,  enjoyed  the  culture   and
    traditions as well as their school days. Returning them  to  Bangladesh
    would have a detrimental effect on their education and development.

38. In the circumstances she found at [36] that there  were  no  compelling
    circumstances about this case.

39. In reply, Mr Karim stated  that  at  the  date  of  hearing  the  third
    appellant was just shy of ten years old. She was on the verge of  going
    to secondary school.  The  Judge  did  not  properly  engage  with  the
    children. There was evidence relating to  the  child's  education  from
    page  62  of  the  appellant's  bundle.  She  had   accordingly   lived
    continuously in the UK from about 2012 until 2017.

    Assessment

40. Judge Dean has undertaken a detailed assessment of the evidence,  which
    included a full and detailed assessment of the  evidence  of  both  the
    appellant and his witness, Mr Rahman.

41. She  directed  herself  properly  in  accordance  with  the  principles
    enunciated in Deevaseelan.

42. Mr Karim submitted that there is a plausible explanation as to why  the
    writer of the email from the bank set out at  page  44  of  the  bundle
    failed to realise the deduction of the amount of the closing balance on
    the Santander receipt at page 46 left �21,094.54, which was the  amount
    claimed.

43. However, Judge Dean did have regard to the evidence  from  Mr  Mohammed
    Rahman, which included his witness statement and oral  evidence,  which
    related to the asserted provenance of the Santander documents.

44. She ultimately concluded that when taken  in  the  round,  Mr  Rahman's
    account was implausible and undermined the veracity of his  account  of
    the facts.

45. The reliance on the email from the Fraud Department was  not  the  only
    basis  on  which  she  concluded  that  Mr  Rahman's  account  was  not
    plausible.

46. She found that his account of going to various branches before  finally
    persuading someone at the Watney Market branch did not have the ring of
    truth [17]. He had stated that he visited the Watney Market  branch  to
    collect the statement of his account on 9 December 2013.  In  his  oral
    evidence Mr Rahman stated that he visited "a few branches".

47. She also noted that he stated that after  the  appellant  received  the
    Home Office letter dated 14 November 2013, he handed him a copy of that
    letter.  A  Home  Office  letter  dated  3  December  stated  that  the
    information requested was required by 10  December  2013.   Judge  Dean
    found at [18] that Mr Rahman was aware of what information was required
    and visited the Watney Market on 9 December 2013. She  found  that  his
    claim to have visited other branches on 10 December 2013  in  order  to
    obtain a letter was implausible given that on 9 December he had already
    collected a bank statement from that branch where, it was  alleged,  he
    finally acquired the  letter.  That  undermined  the  veracity  of  his
    account on the facts.

48. She also had regard at [19] to the Santander letter dated  10  December
    2013. It was signed by the "Director of Operations".  However,  in  his
    witness statement Mr Rahman stated that he  persuaded  someone  at  the
    front desk to provide the letter and this was handed over to him  later
    that day. Whilst not determinative, when taken in the round  she  found
    that it was implausible that the Director of Operations was sitting  at
    the front desk of the bank, which also undermined the  veracity  of  Mr
    Rahman's account.

49. In addition she noted at [20] that Mr Rahman stated in evidence that he
    showed the Home Office letter dated 14 November 2013 to the  person  at
    the bank. However, the Home Office letters are addressed to  the  first
    appellant and nowhere is Mr Rahman named as a third party sponsor. When
    asked how he was able to obtain the Santander letter when there was  no
    information linking him to the first appellant, who is in fact named in
    the Santander letter, Mr Rahman said he "just  asked  verbally."  Judge
    Dean found that, taken in the round, the  account  is  implausible  and
    again undermines the veracity of his account of the facts.

50. Finally, when asked what happened to the money  which  was  claimed  to
    have been in his account in the amount of �21,094.54, he stated that he
    "gradually gave it to the first appellant." However, he stated that  he
    had no evidence of this. When again asked  what  had  happened  to  the
    money, given that over three years had passed since the letter and  the
    bank statements showing a similar amount, he was unable to provide  any
    answer. That, she found, also undermined the veracity of his account on
    the facts.

51. She found at [22] that Mr  Rahman  was  an  unimpressive  witness.  His
    account of how he obtained the Santander documents was  not  plausible.
    She found it to be a "narrative of convenience" which did  not  advance
    the first appellant's claim  that  the  Santander  documents  were  not
    false. The evidence lacked veracity and  did  not  provide  a  credible
    basis  for  going  behind  the  detailed  findings  of  Judge  Plumtree
    regarding the appellant's submission of false documents.

52. After arriving at that conclusion, she further found that the appellant
    did not meet the requirements of  paragraph  276B(ii)(c)  in  that  the
    character and conduct were not of a type expected of an  applicant  for
    ILR because he had engaged in deception.

53. With regard to the  Article  8  claim,  whilst  there  is  no  explicit
    reference to s.55 of the  2009  Act,  she  has  considered  family  and
    private life under Appendix FM as well as paragraph 276ADE.  The  third
    appellant had not been in the country for seven years at  the  date  of
    the application in August 2015.  Moreover,  the  appellant's  wife  and
    child have returned to Bangladesh in 2011 where  they  remained  for  a
    year, returning in 2012.

54. Accordingly, as at the date of the application the third appellant  had
    not lived continuously in the UK for at least seven years prior to  the
    date of application and had only lived in the UK continuously for three
    years and two months. The Judge noted  that  having  failed  under  the
    rules, there would have to be compelling reasons for allowing it  under
    Article 8.

55. As noted by Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce,  the  analysis  appears  to  be
    confined to assessing the first limb of  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv).  She
    also cautioned that whether the error is material may  be  doubtful  in
    the light of EV (Philippines) and Others v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874 and
    in particular paragraphs [35-49].

56. In EV, Lord Justice Lewison stated that in the real world the appellant
    is almost always the parent who has no right to remain in the  UK.  The
    parent thus relies on the best interests of  his  or  her  children  in
    order to "piggy back" on their rights.  He stated that  the  assessment
    of the best interests of the children must be made on  the  basis  that
    the facts are as they are in the real world [58]. If one parent has  no
    right to remain, but the other parent  does,  that  is  the  background
    against which the assessment is conducted. If neither  parent  has  the
    right to remain, it is the background against which the  assessment  is
    conducted.  The ultimate question will be whether it is  reasonable  to
    expect the child to follow the parent with no right to  remain  in  the
    country of origin.

57. Judge Dean had regard to the fact that the  third  appellant  had  only
    lived in the UK continuously for three years and two months. Her school
    report for 2016 was produced. There was also  a  document  produced  at
    page 105 of the appellant's bundle indicating that she was in  Class  9
    during 2014 and there is a record  of  achievement  produced  dated  13
    February 2015.

58. There was no  evidence  that  the  third  appellant  had  any  specific
    educational or other needs for which she was receiving  any  treatment.
    It was never contended that her removal might  cause  her  any  damage.
    There was no evidence that  the  appellants,  including  the  children,
    could not  re-establish  private  life  in  Bangladesh.  There  was  no
    evidence that appropriate education would not be available to  them  on
    their return.

59. The third appellant came with her mother to the UK  in  2009  and  then
    returned to Bangladesh in 2011 where she  remained  for  a  year  until
    returning to the UK in 2012. The family would be returning together. It
    is evident that the best interests of the children would be  served  by
    remaining with their family.

60. Although the Judge might have given a more structured determination  in
    respect of the best interests of the children, I am satisfied that  she
    has in fact properly appreciated and considered the significance of all
    the evidence relating to their circumstances in the UK.

61. I  also  find  that  Judge  Dean  has  given  sustainable  reasons  for
    concluding that the reasons for dismissing the first appellant's appeal
    against the refusal of ILR did not provide compelling circumstances  or
    give rise to legitimate expectations as the appellants were  only  ever
    here on a temporary basis. There was no expectation for  the  appellant
    or his family of being able to remain here on a permanent basis.

62. The finding that there were no compelling circumstances is  sustainable
    on the evidence.

    Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
