For the Respondent:    Mr  McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born on the 27th April 1989. He
    appeals with permission[1] the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Wedderspoon)[2] to dismiss his  appeal  against  a  decision  to
    refuse to grant  leave  to  remain  on  human  rights  grounds.    That
    decision  arose  from  the  Respondent's  refusal  of  the  Appellant's
    application to remain in the United Kingdom as the spouse of  a  person
    present and settled here[3].




    Background and Matters in Issue


 2. In October 2014 the Appellant made an application for leave  to  remain
    as the husband of British national Ms Mobeen Khan. At the time Ms  Khan
    was working,  and supporting the household from that  income.  She  had
    two jobs.   The Appellant completed a  'FLR(M)'  application  form,  to
    apply for settlement under the five-year  route.  The  application  was
    supported by documentary evidence respect of his wife's income.


 3. Sometime after the application was lodged Ms Khan became unwell to  the
    extent that it was not possible for her to maintain  both  employments.
    On the 30th June 2015 the Appellant's representatives properly notified
    the Secretary of  State  of  this  change  of  circumstances.   Further
    evidence  was  submitted.  This  included   correspondence   from   the
    Department for Work and Pensions confirming that she was in receipt  of
    a 'Personal Independence Payment' (PIP).  In the  letter  of  the  30th
    June 2015 the Appellant's representative pointed out that in accordance
    with paragraph E-LTRP.3.3  of Appendix FM the receipt of PIP meant that
    all Ms Khan had to show was that she was able to  "adequately  maintain
    and accommodate" her husband.  The letter  sought  to  illustrate  that
    this test could be met with reference to the level  of  income  support
    that the couple would  have  been  in  receipt  of  had  they  been  so
    entitled. The calculation given was that on income support  they  would
    have been receiving �904.83 per month, whereas with the employment that
    remained, and the PIP,  the household income was �1,242.79 per month.

 4. The decision-maker who wrote the refusal letter on the 15th  July  2015
    does not appear to have taken any of that evidence into account.   This
    is possibly because the Appellant was refused under  the  'suitability'
    requirements in Appendix FM, on  the  grounds  that  he  had  exercised
    deception by  relying  on  a  fraudulently  obtained  English  language
    certificate  from  the  Educational  Testing  Service  (ETS).  Had  the
    decision-maker stopped there, the refusal letter might have been easier
    to follow. As it is it goes on to accept that the Appellant  meets  the
    'relationship' requirements, and then  addresses  'EX.1'.   Finding  no
    insurmountable obstacles to the relationship  continuing  in  Pakistan,
    the application is refused.

 5. This rather idiosyncratic structure was then adopted by the  First-tier
    Tribunal. Dealing  first  with  the  question  of  'suitability',   the
    Tribunal finds there to be insufficient evidence to conclude that there
    was any attempted deception  on the part of the  Appellant.  There  has
    been no challenge to that part of the decision. The determination  then
    proceeds to find that at the date of decision the Appellant had  failed
    to supply all of the specified evidence of his wife's employments.  The
    PIP is mentioned, but  no finding made as to whether or not that  means
    that the requirements of the rules  are  met.   The  remainder  of  the
    determination is concerned alternately with Article 8 'outside  of  the
    rules', and  with  whether  there  are  'insurmountable  obstacles'  to
    relocation, the question posed by EX.1.  The appeal is dismissed on the
    grounds that such obstacles do not exist.

 6. The Appellant now appeals on the grounds that he  needed  not  rely  on
    either EX.1 or Article 8 'outside of the rules'.   The  Tribunal  found
    that he had not attempted to deceive the Respondent.  That finding  has
    not been challenged in the Rule 24 response or otherwise.  There  being
    no other ground upon which  his  'suitability'  is  impugned,  all  the
    Appellant  need  do  is  establish  that  he  meets   the   eligibility
    requirements under Appendix FM. This, he submits, he  has  always  been
    able to do, with reference to the family income and the  PIP.   Receipt
    of the PIP substantially lowered the level of income that the Appellant
    needed to meet.



    My Findings

 7. I am grateful to Mr McVeety and Mr Reyaz for  taking  the  time  to  go
    through the  documentation,  chronology  and  rules  together.    Their
    agreed position before me was as follows:


              i) The application of October 2014 was under  the  'five  year
                 route to settlement' (form FLR(M))


             ii) That application was properly varied prior to the  decision
                 to include reliance on the PIP;


            iii) The suitability issue has been resolved in the  Appellant's
                 favour;


             iv) The household  income  was  demonstrated  at  the  date  of
                 decision (and in fact  now)  to  be  well  over  the  level
                 required to show "adequacy";

              v) All  other  requirements  of  Appendix  FM,  including  the
                 English language requirement (the Appellant holds a Masters
                 degree) have been met.


 8. I agree. The Tribunal had  no  need  to  consider  whether  there  were
    'insurmountable obstacles' to the family life continuing  in  Pakistan,
    nor any other consideration arising from Article 8  case-law.  That  is
    because Appendix FM represents where the Secretary of  State  considers
    that the balance is to be struck in Article 8 cases.  If  an  applicant
    meets all of the requirements of the rules therein - as  the  Appellant
    did in this case - the  Tribunal  need  look  no  further,  because  it
    follows  that   the   removal   of   such   an   applicant   would   be
    disproportionate.


 9. The error of law in this determination was the  failure  to  take  into
    account  the  terms  of  E-LTRP.3.3  and   to   recalculate   financial
    eligibility in light of the PIP.  Had this been done,   it  would  have
    been apparent,  as it is now, that the Appellant had complied with  the
    requirements of Appendix FM at the date of decision.






    Decisions


10. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal  contains  errors  of  law
    such that it should be set aside to the extent identified above.


11. I remake the decision in the appeal as follows:

    "The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds".

12. There is no order for anonymity.
