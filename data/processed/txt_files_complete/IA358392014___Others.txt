For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Appellants' appeal against the decision  of  Judge  Caswell
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 6th November 2014.

Background

 2. The Appellants are Jamaican nationals born on 21st November 1974,  10th
    October 1968 and 24th December 2007 respectively.  The first  Appellant
    entered the UK as  a  student  on  14th  March  2002  and  was  granted
    successively leave to remain until  February  2007.   She  applied  for
    further leave to remain and was refused  in  August  2007  but  only  a
    limited right of appeal was given.  She took no action.

 3. On 3rd July 2013 all three Appellants applied for leave  to  remain  on
    Article 8 grounds.  The application was refused on 9th August 2013 with
    no right of appeal but, as a result of judicial review  proceedings  in
    June 2014, the Respondent agreed to reconsider the application  and  to
    make an appealable decision.

 4. On 24th August 2014 the Respondent refused the applications on  Article
    8 grounds and made a decision to direct the  Appellants'  removal.  Her
    position was that the Appellants were in the UK illegally, valid  leave
    having expired in 2007 for the first Appellant and earlier  (2005)  for
    the second.

 5. The judge relied on CHH (Notices Regulations - right of appeal -  leave
    to remain) Jamaica [2011] UKUT 00121 and held that there  was  no  time
    limit on raising a human rights claim  after  a  restricted  notice  of
    decision.  The first Appellant had invoked her limited right of  appeal
    by informing the Respondent on 21st October 2014 that the  decision  of
    the 13th August 2007 breached her human rights under  Article  8.   The
    Respondent was under a duty to re-serve the decision with the  relevant
    appeal form and until such re-service, the Appellant was still lawfully
    in the UK by reason of Section 3C(2)(b) of the 1971 Act.

 6. The judge concluded that the first Appellant was lawfully  in  the  UK.
    There is no appeal against that aspect of her decision. She  then  went
    on to consider the merits of the human rights grounds and dismissed the
    appeal.

The Grounds of Application

 7. The Appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had erred in law.  In finding that the first Appellant was lawfully  in
    the UK, the decision of the Respondent dated 24th August 2014 could not
    have been in accordance with the law,  since  it  was  based  upon  the
    Respondent's assumption that the Appellant had overstayed her leave  in
    the UK and her presence in the UK was unlawful.

 8. Secondly, the judge had erred in  rejecting  the  submission  that  the
    appeal should be allowed under paragraph 276B grounds which  creates  a
    presumption that once the first Appellant  has  been  continuously  and
    lawfully residing in the UK for ten years, having  regard  to  all  the
    circumstances, leave will normally be granted unless it is  shown  that
    there are reasons having regard to the public interest why it would  be
    undesirable to do so.  At the date of the hearing the  first  Appellant
    satisfied paragraph 276A(i) of the Immigration Rules.  Furthermore  she
    erred in her consideration of the Article 8 claim.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Landes on 12th  January  2015
    for the reasons stated in the grounds.

10. On 16th January 2015  the  Respondent  served  a  reply  reserving  her
    position.

Findings and conclusions

11. At the hearing Mr McVeety conceded that the  decision  of  24th  August
    2014 was unlawful because it was made on the mistaken premise that  the
    first Appellant's leave had expired on 18th February  2007  whereas  in
    fact it was continuing.  He agreed that the proper course was  for  the
    matter to be remitted back to the Secretary of State so that  a  lawful
    decision could be made.  Mr Ali agreed that that was the correct course
    of action.

12. The judge erred in law because, having found that the  first  Appellant
    was lawfully in this country she then went on to dismiss the appeal  on
    the basis of a decision which was not lawfully made.

Notice of Decision

13. The original judge erred in law.   The  decision  is  set  aside.   The
    following decision is substituted.  The Secretary of  State's  decision
    is not in accordance with the law and accordingly the appeal is allowed
    insofar as it is remitted back to her to make a lawful decision.

No anonymity direction is made.
