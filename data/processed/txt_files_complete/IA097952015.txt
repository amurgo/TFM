                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the claimant's appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State to refuse  to  grant  him  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and against the Secretary  of
    State's concomitant decision to remove him from the UK.  The First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do  not  consider
    that the claimant requires anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper
    Tribunal.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 26 May 2016 Upper Tribunal Judge Blum granted permission  to  appeal
    for the following reasons:

         "2.  The grounds contend that the judge  erred  in  law  by  taking
             account  of  evidence  provided  after  the  making   of   the
             Appellant's  application,  contrary  to  section  85A  of  the
             Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the cases  of
             Ahmed (PBS: admissible evidence) [2014] UKUT 00365  (IAC)  and
             Olatunde [2015] EWCA Civ 670.  It  is  clear  that  the  judge
             allowed the Appellant to give oral evidence at the hearing [9]
             and took account of that evidence in her assessment [18].

         3.   It is arguable that by hearing  and  taking  account  of  oral
             evidence at the hearing the judge misdirected herself  in  law
             as to the restrictions contained in section 85A".

Relevant Background

 3. The claimant had previously been granted leave to remain in the  United
    Kingdom until 25 July 2013 as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant.   He  applied
    for leave to remain to set up a business called FS & Co Auto Sales, for
    which he provided a business plan.  The plan said that there was a need
    in the Slough for a large selection of quality used cars, and FS  &  Co
    would sell these top quality used vehicles at a competitive price.  The
    owner and sales manager had years of combined  experience  in  new  and
    used auto sales in the UK and Pakistan.  They would continue to develop
    their excellent working relationship with local dealers and auctions to
    bring savings to the customer.

 4. The claimant's completed Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  application  form  was
    received on 24 July 2013 and the claimant  was  interviewed  about  his
    application on 16 January 2015.  The interview record was not  included
    in the Home Office bundle for the hearing in the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    But the claimant's solicitors obtained  a  copy  of  the  interview  in
    advance of the hearing, and it is to be found at page  166  onwards  of
    the first appeal bundle.

 5. The claimant was interviewed in accordance with  a  standard  temporary
    migration credibility  interview  template  (Tier  1).   He  was  asked
    questions about his experience, his team member, business  development,
    market  research,  contract   and   pricing,   funding   and   business
    performance.

 6. At the end of the interview, the interviewing officer was  required  to
    complete a short questionnaire.  Question C was whether there were  any
    points  in  the  interview  where  the  applicant  appeared   to   lack
    credibility?  He answered yes and went on to give a brief explanation:

         [A]pplicant is running two business (sic) as well  as  a  part-time
         job.  They have already had one used car business which he  is  not
         running anymore.

 7. On 17 February 2015  the  Secretary  of  State  gave  her  reasons  for
    refusing the application.

 8. All the reasons related to the answers which the claimant had given  in
    the interview.  On the topic of funding, he had confirmed that no money
    had been invested into the business by the third party  funder.   There
    was no guarantee that the money would be  transferred  if  a  visa  was
    issued, and as he had made no attempt to transfer the money into  a  UK
    account, this raised concern over the genuineness  of  the  funds.   He
    also said that he had spent �26,000 to �27,000 yearly  on  advertising,
    but this was not credible as advertising on Gumtree was usually free of
    charge.  There was also no evidence that he had spent  this  amount  of
    money  on  any  advertising  nor  had  he  provided  any  evidence   of
    advertising.

 9. On the topic of business development, he stated in  interview  that  he
    had registered  with  Companies  House,  but  following  a  check  with
    Companies House it was found that the business was not registered.   He
    also stated he did  not  have  any  business  insurance.   It  was  not
    credible that somebody setting up in business would not register  their
    company as per UK law and also would not take out  any  insurance.   He
    stated that his business had not started yet, but when questioned about
    turnover he stated that he had started six months back so in  the  last
    quarter his turnover was �38,000 to �40,000.  This  was  contradictory,
    and there was also no evidence that it  was  true.   On  the  topic  of
    market research, they were not satisfied he had undertaken  any  viable
    market research. When asked what market research he had carried out, he
    had stated actually there was no need for research for this business.

10. Based on the above considerations, the Secretary of State was therefore
    refusing his application because he had not satisfactorily demonstrated
    that he was a genuine entrepreneur.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

11. For the purposes of the appeal hearing, the claimant's solicitors  took
    a lengthy witness statement from the appellant in which he said that he
    had worked for twelve years for the Pakistani subsidiary of the  Suzuki
    motor corporation in Pakistan and thus learnt about car  manufacturing,
    maintenance and the engine assembly process from a number of  different
    perspectives.  While in the UK as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant,  he  had
    established a used car sales business under the name  of  Cars  Comfort
    Limited  of  which  he  was  the  sole  director.   This  business  was
    relatively successful.  He had operated  with  an  annual  turnover  of
    about �100,000 with a good profit margin.  In the summer  2013,  around
    the time he made his application for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant, he applied for "strike  down"  in  relation  to
    Cars Comfort.  The business was still  solvent  and  was  still  making
    money, but he decided he wanted to start a new business.

12. He also ran another business called UENS UK Limited  established  by  a
    friend of his in 2011.  He joined  the  company  in  October  2013  and
    became a sole director of the company on 1 November 2013.  He  took  on
    this  business  because  his  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  application  was
    outstanding, and it provided him  with  an  additional  income  stream.
    UENS was an export business, dealing in spare  parts  for  cars,  which
    worked directly with contacts in Pakistan.  In  the  last  six  months,
    UENS's turnover was more  than  �50,000.   It  was  still  functioning,
    although his focus had shifted to running his new business FS & Co Auto
    Sales.  In August 2012  he  took  work  with  a  security  firm  Vision
    Security Group (VSG) which was part  of  the  Compass  Group.   He  was
    employed through their Northampton branch but he was sent all over  the
    UK to work.  He worked most frequently at a packing warehouse of a duty
    free shop in Slough.

13. He went on to comment  on  the  interview.   The  interviewing  officer
    seemed to be very rigid during the interview.  He was not sure  whether
    this was because the interview  was  being  conducted  over  Skype,  or
    whether he had to stick to his set of questions.  During the  interview
    the interviewing officer became confused about the different businesses
    he was involved in.  When he asked him whether he  had  registered  the
    business, as UENS was a company he had just  been  speaking  about,  he
    assumed he was talking about UENS.

14. After a few questions, he  began  to  get  concerned  the  interviewing
    officer was not asking about FS & Co which was the business that he was
    making his application in relation to.

15. He had read through the interview transcript and it did not reflect the
    interview he had.  It did not provide the responses written down in the
    order that they were recorded.  There was no record  of  him  informing
    the interviewing officer that he should be asking him  questions  about
    FS & Co.

16. At the outset of the hearing, the Presenting Officer  objected  to  the
    claimant giving oral evidence in relation to the  interview  record  on
    the  basis  that  it  would  be  postdecision  evidence  and  therefore
    disallowed in terms of Ahmed.  The judge decided  it  was  not  in  the
    interests of justice to refuse to allow him to give oral evidence.   He
    observed that the interview itself was not postdecision.  He ruled that
    the  claimant  should  be  allowed  to  comment   on   the   interview,
    particularly when it formed the basis of the respondent's refusal.   It
    went to the root of what was being appealed.

17. The claimant proceeded to give oral evidence, and he was cross-examined
    by the Presenting Officer.  In his closing submissions on behalf of the
    Secretary of State, the  Presenting  Officer  submitted  the  interview
    transcript showed that a clear interview was conducted, and he  invited
    the judge to reject the claimant's evidence that the interview had  not
    been conducted correctly and there had been a mix up  in  the  way  his
    answers had been recorded.  In reply, the claimant's Counsel  submitted
    there was very little or no substance in the reasons for refusal.  They
    were based on inconsistencies and mistakes arising from the  manner  of
    the interview.  The refusal was  fundamentally  undermined  as  it  was
    based almost entirely  on  the  interview  transcript.   Based  on  the
    evidence submitted by the claimant contained at tab F of the claimant's
    bundle there was sufficient evidence before the Secretary of  State  to
    grant the application.  Her primary position was for  the  Tribunal  to
    allow the appeal on the basis that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  not
    properly considered or taken  account  of  all  the  evidence  and  the
    decision was not therefore in accordance with the law.

18. In his subsequent decision, the judge's  reasons  for  finding  in  the
    claimant's favour were set out at paragraphs  [18]  to  [21],  which  I
    reproduce verbatim below:

         "18. I have considered all the evidence on file, the subjective and
             objective evidence (some of  which  may  not  be  specifically
             referred to herein), the oral evidence given  at  the  hearing
             and the submissions  of  both  parties.   I  have  taken  into
             account all the evidence presented to me which I am  permitted
             to consider in light of Ahmed and Olatunde and paragraph 245AA
             of the  Immigration  Rules.   The  Appellant's  representative
             asked me to find  that  Ahmed  had  been  decided  wrongly  in
             relation to the linking of evidence on  points  based  matters
             and evidence  on  the  genuineness  of  the  application.   In
             Olatunde  Lord  Justice  Moore-Bick  held  that  section   85A
             restricts the evidence  that  the  tribunal  can  consider  on
             appeal against a decision based on sub-paragraph (h) alone.  I
             was asked to find  that  both  of  these  decisions  had  been
             wrongly decided.  Upper  Tribunal  decisions  are  binding  on
             First Tier  Tribunals  and  I  am  unable  to  accede  to  the
             Appellant's representative's submission on this point.   I  do
             however find that I see nothing wrong in the Appellant  giving
             evidence (albeit post-decision) to clarify matters  raised  by
             the Respondent in the notice of refusal.   This  includes  the
             interview transcript.  The Appellant's  representative  argued
             that the interview was fatally  flawed  as  a  result  of  the
             confusion surrounding the Appellant's answers in  relation  to
             the two businesses he has.  The confusion is not  assisted  by
             the fact that the interview was carried out  via  Skype.   The
             Appellant, when asked at the end of the interview,  felt  that
             he had given a good account of his businesses.  He would  have
             been unaware of what the interviewer  had  recorded  until  he
             received  a  typed  transcript.   When  he  did  receive   the
             transcript he went over it with his solicitor and  prepared  a
             witness statement  pointing  out  the  errors  and  confusion.
             Contrary to what the Respondent's representative  submitted  I
             do not see that there was any onus on the Appellant at such  a
             late stage (six weeks pre-hearing) to make a formal  complaint
             to the Home Office regarding the interview.  The appeal was on-
             going and a  hearing  had  been  fixed.   It  was  within  the
             Appellant's remit to produce his response in oral evidence  at
             the hearing so as to  clarify  the  misunderstandings  in  the
             interview record.

         19.  There  was  some  discussion  over  the  significance  of  his
             business partner Sohail and his unsuccessful  application  for
             entry clearance from Pakistan to join the Appellant in FS  and
             Co.  I took the view that this was a side issue which  had  no
             direct bearing on the legal issues before me  in  relation  to
             this appeal.  I did not  find  that  the  position  of  Sohail
             altered the Appellant's position in relation  to  this  appeal
             and it did not affect his credibility.

         20.  I considered the evidence provided by the Appellant  with  his
             application as listed in the notice of refusal  and  contained
             (with other inadmissible documents not  before  the  decision-
             maker) in the  Appellant's  bundle.   I  also  considered  the
             interview transcript in light of the notice of refusal and the
             Appellant's explanations.  The Appellant has been involved  in
             the car business all his life.  He has extensive knowledge  of
             what is necessary to conduct such business.  He  has  done  so
             successfully with previous businesses.  He  is  aware  of  the
             requirement for insurance.   He  has  the  business  contacts,
             local knowledge and understanding of how to operate and  price
             his goods in a competitive market.  He has financial  backing.
             I accept his explanation of the confusion arising in the Skype
             interview where he  is  talking  about  two  businesses.   His
             answers and explanation  were  plausible.   I  note  that  the
             notice of  refusal  is  based  entirely  on  the  question  of
             genuineness and it is clear that the Respondent has formed the
             view that the Appellant is not genuine based on his answers to
             a confusing interview.  In my opinion it is open to come to  a
             different conclusion on the permissible evidence regarding the
             question of genuineness.  I find the Appellant's  evidence  to
             be straightforward and credible in relation to the genuineness
             of his application.

         21.  I find that the Respondent has made a decision which is not in
             accordance with the law to  the  extent  that  she  finds  the
             Appellant's application to be lacking in genuineness.  For the
             reasons given above I have come  to  a  different  view.   The
             appeal is therefore allowed to this extent."

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

19. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Mr Avery developed the argument advanced in  the  application  for
    permission to appeal.  It was abundantly clear from  the  case  law  of
    Ahmed and Olatunde that a  refusal  on  the  basis  of  an  appellant's
    failure to demonstrate the genuineness of the business  was  interwoven
    with the acquisition  of  points.   As  a  result  of  that  link,  the
    prohibition on adducing new evidence set out in Section 85A(3)  of  the
    2002 Act would apply to any new  evidence  to  support  an  appellant's
    claim that the business was genuine.  As such, the new evidence  relied
    upon by the judge to allow this claimant's appeal was prohibited as  it
    went towards the acquisition of points and it did not fall  within  the
    exception under Section 85A(4)(d) of the 2002 Act.

20. No distinction could be drawn between oral  and  documentary  evidence.
    The prohibition applied to both forms of evidence.

21. On behalf of  the  claimant,  Mr  Richardson  developed  the  arguments
    advanced in his Rule 24 response.  Ahmed did not  have  the  effect  of
    preventing an appellant from giving explanatory evidence in  connection
    with documents submitted in support of the application and  answers  in
    interview, which themselves predated the date of decision.  To  suggest
    otherwise  would  produce  absurd  results,  which  would  offend   the
    principle of common law fairness.

22. His second submission was that Ahmed was wrongly decided.  It was clear
    from the format of the decision letter and from the way  in  which  the
    Rules were drafted that a distinction existed between refusals  because
    adequate documents were not submitted, and refusals after an  interview
    has  occurred  on  the  grounds  of  genuineness.   Since  the   latter
    necessarily involved an assessment of credibility, it was an affront to
    commonsense to suggest that this could  be  done  by  a  judge  without
    hearing from the appellant.

23. Giving the leading judgment of the court in Olatunde,  Moore-Bick  said
    at paragraph [26] that in the instant case  it  was  not  necessary  to
    decide whether, if an applicant could in  practice  fail  to  meet  the
    requirements of subparagraph (h) without  falling  within  subparagraph
    (k), Section 85A  restricted  the  evidence  that  the  Tribunal  could
    consider on appeal against a decision based on subparagraph (h)  alone.



24. His third submission was that, if an error of law was  identified,  the
    appeal should be allowed on the alternative ground that  the  Secretary
    of State's decision was  unlawful  on  account  of  it  being  made  in
    contravention of the principles of common law  fairness.   He  cited  a
    passage in the speech of Lord Mustill in R v Home  Secretary  Ex  Doody
    [1994] 1AC 531 at 560 where the judge said that what  fairness  demands
    is dependent on the context of the decision and this  is  to  be  taken
    into account in all its aspects:

         "(5) Fairness will very often require that  a  person  who  may  be
             adversely affected by the decision will have an opportunity to
             make representations on  his  own  behalf  either  before  the
             decision is taken  with  a  view  to  producing  a  favourable
             result: or after it is taken, with a  view  to  procuring  its
             modification; or both."

25. In paragraph 24 of his Rule 24 response Mr Richardson gave examples  of
    matters that formed the basis of the adverse decision, which were never
    put to the claimant in his interview  and  about  which  he  was  never
    permitted to give an explanation:

      a) In relation to the investment funds not being  transferred  to  the
         UK, which was unsurprising given that the application had  not  yet
         been determined, the claimant was never asked why this had not been
         done.  He was thus unfairly deprived of the opportunity to  provide
         an explanation.

      b) The claimant was criticised for failing to provide any evidence  of
         advertising expenditure or any advertising material, but was  never
         asked, or provided with an opportunity, to do so.

      c) The claimant was never asked about  his  experience  in  the  motor
         industry or requested to provide evidence of the same.  Had he been
         asked, he was plainly in a position to provide an abundance of such
         evidence.

      d) It was  never  put  to  the  claimant  that  his  company  was  not
         registered at Companies House.  This had the  consequence  that  he
         was unable to clarify the company to which  he  referred  as  being
         registered was UENS Limited and, most importantly, to clarify  that
         FSC was not registered because it was not a limited company.

      e) The alleged contradiction about whether or  not  the  business  was
         trading was never put to the claimant.  He was thereby deprived  of
         the opportunity to clarify that the business which was trading  was
         UENS Limited and not FSC.

      f) The letter inviting the claimant for interview unequivocally stated
         that further documents would not  be  accepted  at  the  interview.
         There  was  then,  subsequently  at  the  interview,   no   further
         opportunity of further documentary evidence to be submitted by  the
         claimant.  The criticisms about  his  failure  to  provide  further
         evidence  in  the  refusal  letter  were   therefore   particularly
         pernicious.

Discussion

26. There is considerable force in the Secretary of State's  error  of  law
    challenge.  By being permitted to adopt his witness statement  as  part
    of his evidence-in-chief, and then being questioned  extensively  about
    its contents, the claimant was clearly providing additional information
    about his application beyond that which was available to the  decision-
    maker when making a decision to refuse his application.

27. What is envisaged by the Rules is that an applicant  should  be  judged
    inter alia on his performance in interview, not on his performance when
    giving oral evidence by way of appeal.  So prima facie the  receipt  of
    oral  evidence  from  the  claimant   breached   the   prohibition   on
    postdecision evidence directed at establishing that  the  Secretary  of
    State had been wrong to conclude the application  was  not  genuine  by
    reference to one or more of the factors listed in subparagraph  (h)  of
    paragraph 245DD of the Rules.  I do not consider that  the  point  left
    open by Moore-Bick LJ in Olatunde is of any assistance to the  claimant
    on the facts of this case.

28. However, I consider that the claimant's evidence  about  the  interview
    was admissible for  the  purpose  of  seeking  to  establish  that  the
    claimant had been a victim of common law unfairness in respect  of  the
    way in which the interview had been conducted and/or recorded.  It  was
    open to the judge to accept the central thrust of the  submission  made
    by Counsel for the claimant that the interview was fatally flawed as  a
    result of the confusion surrounding the claimant's answers in  relation
    to the two businesses which he had.

29. Following the interview, the Home Office conducted  further  enquiries,
    and established that FSC had not been registered.  The Home Office  had
    not sought  an  explanation  from  the  claimant  as  to  the  apparent
    contradiction between this discovery and his  claim  in  the  interview
    that the business had been registered at Companies House.  It would  be
    contrary to the requirements of procedural fairness to exclude evidence
    from the claimant that the enquiry undertaken by the  Home  Office  had
    been directed to the wrong business, and that the representation  which
    he had  made  in  the  interview  related  to  UENS  Limited  not  FSC.
    Similarly, it would be  contrary  to  the  requirements  of  procedural
    fairness to have excluded the claimant from clarifying that  there  was
    no contradiction in respect of his answers on the topic of whether  the
    business was trading, as one  answer  that  he  gave  related  to  UENS
    Limited and the other answer related to FSC.

30. Accordingly, I consider that it was open to  the  judge  to  allow  the
    appeal on the primary position taken by Counsel at the  hearing,  which
    was that the decision was not in accordance with  the  law  as  it  was
    entirely based on the interview which was fatally flawed as a result of
    the confusion surrounding the claimant's answers in relation to the two
    businesses which he had.

31. The judge however erred in allowing the appeal under the Rules. For the
    claimant's  evidence  was  only  admissible   for   the   purposes   of
    establishing that the decision was not in accordance with the law.   It
    was not admissible for the purpose of enabling the judge to come  to  a
    different view on the question of whether the application was  genuine.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeal under the  Rules
contained an error of law, and accordingly the decision  is  set  aside  and
the following decision is substituted:

The claimant's appeal is allowed on the ground that  the  decision  appealed
against was not in accordance with the law  as  the  interview  forming  the
basis of  decision  was  fatally  flawed,  and  a  lawful  decision  on  the
claimant's application for leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
Migrant remains outstanding.

No anonymity direction is made.
