For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola (HOPO)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Braybrook promulgated on 15th July 2014, following a hearing at  Taylor
    House on 9th July 2014.  In the determination, the judge dismissed  the
    appeal of Olumide Olutola.  The Appellant applied for, and was granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal and thus  the  matter  comes
    before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Nigeria, who was born on 16th May
    1984.  He appeals against  a  decision  of  the  Respondent  dated  7th
    November 2013 refusing him leave to remain  in  the  UK  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he has set up Lumidee Limited, which  was
    incorporated on 21st January 2013,  he  has  submitted  a  letter  from
    Stanbic IBTC Bank in Lagos.  There are details of  an  account  in  his
    name which was set up on 7th June 2013.  He had an opening  balance  of
    2,000 Nigerian naira.  The Appellant also has in Nigeria �51,763 in his
    bank account there.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge dismissed the appeal on the basis that there was very little,
    if any, evidence of business activity on the part  of  the  Appellant's
    business.  At the date of the application and interview he had only one
    client, Muse Consult.  The contract with Muse Consult gives very little
    detail as to the Appellant's role  in  their  business.   There  is  no
    detail of the work he did in oral evidence.  Muse Consult also  had  no
    website presence although according to the Appellant in interview  they
    were also "in internet solutions".  The Appellant was also  unclear  as
    to whether or not Muse Consult had a website.  Moreover, the  Appellant
    himself gave a vague account of his own website.

 5. Finally, as far as the funds in his account were concerned,  the  judge
    held that,

         "The Appellant's evidence as to the provenance of the funds in  the
         Stanbic  account  was  anything  but  straightforward.   There  was
         nothing to corroborate his assertion that the funds were  from  his
         family rather than the third parties he  did  not  know  but  whose
         names featured as the  depositors  in  the  Stanbic  account.   The
         Appellant was not able to give a satisfactory explanation  why  his
         father was not able to deposit the sum in person stating  that  his
         father was busy and then that he  was  indisposed"  (see  paragraph
         16).

Grounds of Application

 6. There are two grounds of application.  First, that the judge had  mixed
    up the facts in relation to this Appellant with the  facts  of  another
    case.  This is evidently so.  The judge states at paragraph 10 that "Ms
    Cooke  relied  on  the  refusal  letter".   There  was  no   Ms   Cooke
    representing the Respondent Secretary of State in this case.  The judge
    also states, at paragraph 11, that "Mr Garrod relied on the Grounds  of
    Appeal  and  skeleton".   There  was  no  Mr  Garrod  representing  the
    Appellant.  The judge also then stated,  at  paragraph  13,  that  "the
    burden of proof is on the Appellant to establish that  on  balance  she
    meets the requirements of the Rules ...".   The  Appellant  was  not  a
    "she" but a "he".

 7.  The  second  ground  of  application  is  that  the  judge  took  into
    consideration matters that were not a requirement under the Immigration
    Rules.  This was clear from  what  the  judge  said  at  paragraph  14,
    namely, that, "there was  very  little  if  any  evidence  of  business
    activity on the part of the Appellant's business.  At the date  of  the
    application and interview, he only had one client, Muse  Consult  ...".
    It was said that the judge failed to properly consider the contract  of
    service between the Appellant's company and Mews Consult Limited.

 8. On 4th August 2014, permission to appeal was granted on the basis  that
    it was arguable that the judge had erred because of mixing up the facts
    between two different cases.

 9. On 12th August 2014, a Rule 24 response was entered by  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State to the effect that "there is clearly an error in  as
    much that paragraphs 10-13 clearly related  to  a  different  Appellant
    from Mr Olutola".  It is said, however, that "when these paragraphs are
    excluded the determination makes perfect sense" and that in particular,
    "paragraphs 14 and 15 make clear and cogent adverse findings".

The Hearing

10. At the hearing before me on 22nd September 2014, Mr  Ume-Ezeuke  relied
    upon the grounds of application.  First, he submitted that the judge at
    paragraphs 10 and 11 had  obviously  been  referring  to  a  completely
    different case.  Second, with respect to specific findings of  fact  in
    relation to this case, whereas the judge was right in stating that  the
    Appellant had only one  client  (Muse  Consult),  at  the  hearing  the
    Appellant had stated he was paid �1,275 per month, and  the  judge  was
    referred to the invoices and bank statement to support this.   Mr  Ume-
    Ezeuke submitted that any business making in excess of �1,000 per month
    is a lucrative business.  Furthermore, the judge  had  been  especially
    harsh at paragraph 15 of the determination, when stating that the  only
    evidence of savings available to the Appellant "were the limited  funds
    in  his  HSBC  account  and  the  Stanbic  account".   The  judge   had
    acknowledged that there was no requirement that �50,000 in funds should
    be available in the UK only.  Yet, he had then gone on to  impose  this
    as a requirement.  The Appellant had stated at the  interview  that  he
    had �2,000 available in the UK to him (see his HSBC account at pages E1
    to E11 of the Respondent's bundle).  The judge does not  anywhere  make
    mention of this.

No Error of Law

11. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the  judge  does  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

12. Whereas it is clearly unsatisfactory that  two  substantial  paragraphs
    (namely, paragraphs 10 and 11 of the determination)  have  found  their
    way into the decision of the judge, in a manner that ought to have been
    picked  up  upon  a  re-reading  of  the   determination   before   its
    promulgation, the fact remains that nothing in these paragraphs (or  in
    paragraph 13 which refers to the Appellant as a "she") has any  bearing
    whatsoever on the eventual findings of the judge.   Mr  Ume-Ezeuke  has
    submitted that the Appellant had �2,000 in his UK account.

13. However, the judge refers to the  substantial  amount  of  his  funding
    arising from  his  account  in  Nigeria  and  he  observes  that,  "the
    Appellant's evidence as to the provenance of the funds in  the  Stanbic
    account was anything but straightforward" (paragraph 16).

14. Nothing corroborated the Appellant's assertion that the funds came from
    his family.  The Appellant could not explain why  his  father  did  not
    deposit the sum in person, if the funds came from his family,  and  the
    judge was unpersuaded by the explanation that his father was busy.

15. A third deposit made into the Appellant's account  from  a  Mr  Ogwuok,
    "was said to be a business associate of his sister who  was  unable  to
    make the deposit herself because according to her declaration  she  was
    indisposed" (paragraph 16).  On top of this, the judge was  alarmed  at
    "the timing of the deposits".

16. Eventually this led the judge to the conclusion that, "the  funds  were
    placed in the Stanbic account in June 2013 solely for the  purposes  of
    the application and the Appellant has not satisfied me  that  they  are
    generally available to the Appellant for his business" (paragraph  16).



17. If one excludes the offending  paragraphs  10,  11,  and  13  from  the
    determination, it is clear that these conclusions were ones  that  were
    based upon the evidence before the judge.  They were open to him.

18. The determination is not irrational because what was said in paragraphs
    10, 11 and 13, does not taint the decision of the judge.  The judge  is
    not seen to be having regard to "irrelevant circumstances".

19. In stark public law terms, the determination may be irrelevant  in  the
    manner it is expressed, but it does not reach the standard of amounting
    to an error of law.  The determination stands.

20. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

21. No anonymity order is made.
