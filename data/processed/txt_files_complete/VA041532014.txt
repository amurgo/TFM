Representation:
For the claimant: Mr NH Asghar, sponsor
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Entry Clearance Officer against the  decision
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Kempton promulgated 16.1.15, allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer,
    dated 30.6.14, to refuse him entry clearance to the United Kingdom as a
    family visitor pursuant to paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 13.1.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hodgkinson granted permission  to  appeal  on
    24.2.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 20.5.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out herein, I found that there was an error of  law
    in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that  the
    determination  of  Judge  Kempton  should  be  set  aside  and  remade.
    Following further submissions of the sponsor and Mr McVeety I dismissed
    the appeal, for the reasons set out below.

 5. The refusal of entry clearance attracts only a limited right of appeal,
    on Race Relations and Human Rights grounds. In the  circumstances,  the
    approach of the judge in �9 through �16, assessing the  merits  of  the
    immigration application or decision, was flawed and the conclusions  of
    the judge in respect  of  the  same  irrelevant.  The  statement  that,
    "Ultimately, the issue is one of whether the appeal should  be  refused
    for the appellant to make a fresh application  with  more  evidence  or
    whether it should be allowed," is entirely misconceived.

 6. In Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 112 (IAC) it  was
    held that:

         "In the case of appeals brought against refusal of entry  clearance
         under Article  8  ECHR,  the  claimant's  ability  to  satisfy  the
         Immigration Rules is not the  question  to  be  determined  by  the
         Tribunal,  but  is  capable  of  being  a   weighty,   though   not
         determinative,  factor  when  deciding  whether  such  refusal   is
         proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  of  enforcing  immigration
         control."

 7. And as recently held in Adjei (visit visas -  Article  8)  [2015]  UKUT
    0261 (IAC):

         "The first question to be addressed in an appeal against refusal to
         grant entry clearance as a visitor where only human rights  grounds
         are available is whether Article 8 of the ECHR is engaged  at  all.
         If it is not, which will not infrequently be the case, the Tribunal
         has no jurisdiction to embark upon an assessment of the decision of
         the ECO under the rules and should not  do  so.  If  Article  8  is
         engaged, the Tribunal may need to look at the extent to  which  the
         claimant is said to have failed to meet  the  requirements  of  the
         rule because that may inform the proportionality balancing exercise
         that must follow... As compliance with para 41 of HC 395 is  not  a
         ground of appeal to  be  decided  by  the  Tribunal,  any  findings
         concerning that will carry little weight, especially if based  upon
         arguments advanced only by the appellant."

 8. The first task of the  judge  should  have  been  to  consider  whether
    Article 8 is engaged at all. The decision  contains  no  assessment  of
    Article 8 at all, other than the entirely unreasoned  and  evidentially
    unsupported statement that "I find that in  order  to  maintain  family
    life between the appellant and sponsor, the appeal should be  allowed."
    The decision contains not a single consideration as to why the  refusal
    decision amounted to  a  breach  of  Article  8  and  no  reference  to
    proportionality. The judge had to demonstrate  how  the  refusal  of  a
    temporary visit of the claimant amounted to such a  grave  interference
    with family life protected by Article 8 so as to engage ECHR at all. It
    is clear that the judge failed to follow the Razgar  stepped  approach.
    The judge also ignored section 117B of the 2002 Act to the effect  that
    immigration control is in the public interest.

 9. On the facts of this case that the claimant has a sister in the UK whom
    he has not seen for 8-9 years, and intended to visit the  sponsor,  his
    cousin, and other wider family members in the UK. Whilst these  may  be
    family members and there may be a relationship between them, it is  one
    maintained at a distance. Without more, these are not the sort of close
    family bonds,  more  than  the  normal  emotional  ties  between  close
    relatives,  that  Article  8  is  intended  to  protect.  In   essence,
    impermissibly, the judge found that the Rules were met and proceeded to
    use Article 8 as a general dispensing power.

10. I therefore find that the making of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal involved the making of an error on a point of  law  such  that
    the decision should be set aside.

11. For the same reasons, I find that the decision of the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not in breach of the appellant's Article 8 ECHR  rights  to
    respect for family life. Article 8 is not engaged in this  case.  There
    is nothing to demonstrate that the facts of this case the  decision  of
    the Entry Clearance Officer constitutes such  grave  interference  with
    family life so as to even begin to engage Article 8 at all. Further, it
    is open to the sponsor or other family members to visit  the  appellant
    in Pakistan or elsewhere outside  the  UK.  That  it  is  open  to  the
    appellant to make a further application, taking  care  to  address  the
    reasons for  refusal,  also  demonstrates  that  the  decision  is  not
    disproportionate.

                    I set aside set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
