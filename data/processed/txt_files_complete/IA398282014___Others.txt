                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State has appealed against the determination of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Hembrough  whose  decision  was  promulgated  on  2
    October 2015 and he allowed the appeal on Article  8  grounds  in  what
    appears to have been an entirely unstructured approach to Article 8.  I
    shall refer to Ms Brown as the appellant as she was in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 2. I am satisfied the appellants and their solicitors,  Kalam  Solicitors,
    were properly served with Notices of Hearing by second-class post on  6
    April 2016 at the addresses provided by them to the Tribunal.

 3. The approach that was adopted by the judge  might  be  encapsulated  in
    paragraph 52 in which he said:

         "It is in my view beyond argument that it is in the best  interests
         of the appellant's children to remain in the UK with  their  mother
         and in the family  environment  in  which  they  have  been  raised
         hitherto.  Although I accept that they are young enough to adapt to
         changed circumstances their future in  Nigeria  might  at  best  be
         described as uncertain both as to level of support they may receive
         from their extended family and the appellant's ability to  maintain
         them to an acceptable level."

    That was the basis upon which the judge approached the appeal and I  am
    satisfied that it was not in accordance with the law.

 4. The decision that the judge was required to consider was  the  decision
    of the Secretary of State.  That  decision  set  out  by  reference  to
    Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE the public interest criteria which are
    now applicable.  Those were  not  referred  to  by  the  judge  in  the
    determination at all.

 5. He was dealing with the mother, Ms Brown, and her two children.  All of
    the family are Nigerian citizens.  [VSN] was born on [ ] 2012 and [VCN]
    on [ ] 2014.  Consequently at the date of decision  the  children  were
    very young indeed.  [VSN] was 2 ï¿½ and [VCN] 6 or 7 months.  There is no
    doubt that the best interests of the children were to remain with their
    mother but the crucial factor was whether that should be in the  United
    Kingdom given the requirements of Appendix  FM  and  paragraph  276ADE.
    The structured approach that was adopted by the decision-maker  of  the
    Home Office in the decision that was made on 17 September 2014  follows
    that course and properly concluded that the requirements of  the  Rules
    had not been met.

 6. The appellant had arrived in the United Kingdom on  22  September  2009
    with leave to enter as a visitor.  That was valid until 17 March  2010.
    Thereafter she remained in the United Kingdom unlawfully  and  made  an
    application for further leave to remain which was  refused  in  January
    2012 and proceedings were commenced in that same year  to  enforce  the
    decision.  There was in fact then a first appeal which was  allowed  to
    the limited extent that it was remitted back to the Secretary of  State
    to make a fresh decision and that fresh decision was in due course made
    on 17 September 2014.

 7. The Secretary of State in the decision also  considered  whether  there
    were exceptional circumstances and broadly the circumstances  in  which
    the appellant finds herself in the United Kingdom is that she has  been
    staying with her sister, [G].   Her  sister  has  four  children.   Her
    sister however is a British citizen and all her  children  are  British
    citizens.  Both, however, are single mothers and there  is  no  support
    which is provided as far as we know from the father of the  appellant's
    children and certainly there is no  suggestion  that  he  supports  the
    appellant or the children by the payment of any money.

 8. The judge recorded this situation in broad terms and recorded the  fact
    that [G] had visited Nigeria on some three  occasions.   The  appellant
    reminded me that it was only on the last occasion  that  she  took  all
    four of her children with her and she had provided  evidence  that  she
    had visited friends and indeed also family at a variety of locations in
    Nigeria.  The judge found, and I think properly, that there were family
    connections which the appellant's  sister  has  and  accordingly  those
    would also be connections which were available to the appellant herself
    were she to return.

 9. He went on to say, looking at the appellant in isolation:

         "I do not accept the assertion that  if  returned  to  Nigeria  the
         appellant would be left in a state of destitution.  I find that she
         is a fit and healthy woman who would be returning  to  the  country
         where she was born and where she has spent most  of  her  life  and
         where she has family who  would  be  able  to  assist  her  in  re-
         integrating into life there."

    That of course applied with equal force as far as her two children  are
    concerned although that was not the approach that was  adopted  by  the
    Immigration Judge.  Rather he focussed upon the fact that the  children
    were familiar with the situation in the United Kingdom and that it  was
    therefore in their best interests  to  remain  not  simply  with  their
    mother but in an environment with which they were familiar.

10. In my judgment that flies against the decisions  which  had  been  made
    dealing with the best interests of children.  These children  are  very
    young; even now they have not reached a level where they  have  reached
    the statutory age for education.  They will  be  returning  to  Nigeria
    with their mother and in those circumstances it  cannot  be  said  that
    their best interests are not served by them  returning  together  as  a
    family.  A proper consideration of their best interest  does  not  mean
    that  they  cannot  be  removed  from  the  United  Kingdom  given  the
    circumstances which the judge has found to exist in Nigeria.  It may be
    that the appellant's circumstances in the United Kingdom  supported  by
    her sister are preferable as  far  as  both  she  and  her  sister  are
    concerned.  It may be that the children, all six of them, get  on  very
    well with each other.  It may well be that there would be sadness  that
    this large family can no longer remain as  a  unit  consisting  of  two
    women and six children but that does not mean that it is a violation of
    the appellant's human rights or those of her children.  I bear in  mind
    the immigration history and the fact that they have no right to  remain
    in the United Kingdom and the fact of her (and their) unlawful presence
    since her visitor's leave expired sometime in 2010.

11. Consequently I am satisfied that the  unstructured  approach  that  was
    adopted by the judge was wrong in law.  What was required  was  for  an
    approach adopting that used by the Secretary of State by  reference  to
    Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE.  Had that process been  followed  and
    had the judge then  gone  on  to  deal  with  whether  there  were  any
    exceptional circumstances, (and it goes without saying that  there  are
    none here), then the judge could only have  reached  one  decision  and
    that was that it was not a violation of the  human  rights  of  anybody
    involved in this case for the appellant and  her  two  children  to  be
    removed to Nigeria.

12. In those circumstances my decision is in two parts.  First I find  that
    there was an error of law on the part of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    and I  set  the  decision  aside.   Secondly  I  remake  the  decision,
    dismissing the appeal on all the grounds advanced because there can  be
    nothing which requires further consideration by either  the  First-tier
    Tribunal or by the Upper Tribunal which might  affect  the  outcome  of
    this case.  The facts are clear enough for me to  remake  the  decision
    without hearing any further evidence.

DECISION


      1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses  an  error  on  a
         point of law and I set it aside.

      2. I allow the appeal of the Secretary of State.

      3. I remake the decision dismissing the appellants' appeal on all  the
         grounds advanced.

      4. No anonymity direction is made.
