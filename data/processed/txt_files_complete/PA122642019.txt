                            DECISION AND REASONS



Introduction

 1. These are the approved record of the decision and reasons which I  gave
    orally at the end of the hearing on 16th March 2021.

 2. Both representatives and I attended the hearing via  Skype,  while  the
    hearing was also open to attend at Field House.  The  parties  did  not
    object  to  attending  via  Skype  and  I  was   satisfied   that   the
    representatives were able to participate in the hearing.

 3. This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Garratt (the 'FtT'), promulgated on 12th November  2020,
    by which he dismissed the appellant's appeal against  the  respondent's
    refusal on 29th November  2019  of  his  protection  and  human  rights
    claims.

 4. In essence, the  appellant's  claims  involved  the  following  issues:
    whether the appellant, an Iraqi citizen of Kurdish ethnic  origin,  had
    converted to Christianity as claimed in 2009,  and,  according  to  the
    appellant's  account,  because  of  hostilities  from  his  family,  he
    internally relocated to  a  majority  Christian  town  which  was  then
    captured by ISIS; and whether the appellant  also  feared  the  Kurdish
    authorities because his wife's brothers were members of  the  peshmerga
    and security services. In rejecting the appellant's asylum  claim,  the
    respondent considered the appellant's immigration history. He had first
    come to the UK on 11st  August  2004  illegally,  claimed  asylum;  his
    asylum claim was dismissed in 2005 and he then returned voluntarily  to
    Iraq in May 2006 using the respondent's voluntary departure  programme.
    He was later encountered in August 2017 in the UK,  and  it  transpired
    that the appellant had left Iraq once again in 2014, claimed asylum  in
    Bulgaria and Belgium, but the respondent had decided not to return  the
    appellant under the Dublin III Regulation.  The appellant  had  a  wife
    and three children, born in Iraq who were dependent on  his  claim,  as
    well as a fourth child born in the UK in 2018.

 5. The respondent did not accept  the  circumstances  of  the  appellant's
    claimed conversion to be credible, nor his claim that his  family  were
    strict Muslims. The appellant had no  personal  encounters  with  ISIS.
    Having considered her own Country Policy and Information Note or 'CPIN'
    of February 2019, the respondent regarded  the  appellant's  return  to
    Iraq, because of the availability of international flights to Erbil and
    Sulamaniyah, as possible. The respondent had considered  the  need  for
    the appellant to have an identity document or CSID and assumed that the
    appellant had family members in Iraq  who  would  will  assist  him  in
    obtaining a new CSID. The respondent concluded that the appellant would
    not be at risk of indiscriminate violence  so  as  to  be  entitled  to
    humanitarian protection or that his  return  would  breach  his  rights
    under articles 2 and 3 ECHR. In respect of article 8, the appellant and
    his family could return  together  to  Iraq  and  there  were  no  very
    significant obstacles to integration there, because  Christians  living
    in  the  'IKR'  (the  autonomous  Kurdish  region  of  Iraq)  were  not
    persecuted.



The FtT's decision

 6. The FtT first considered the appellant's credibility. At �16,  the  FtT
    noted apparent inconsistencies in the  appellant's  account  about  his
    contact with people in Iraq; the lack of adverse  interest  from  ISIS;
    and his  family's  knowledge  of  his  conversion.   At  �18,  the  FtT
    considered  whether  there  were  inconsistencies  in  the  appellant's
    account of taking his children to church. At �19,  the  FtT  considered
    the reason why he had not awaited the outcome of his  asylum  claim  in
    Bulgaria and the  refusal  of  his  claim  in  Belgium.  The  FtT  also
    considered the evidence of churchgoers in  Lichfield  at  ��22  to  26.
    These witnesses testified as to the genuineness in their  view  of  the
    appellant's faith.

 7. Having considered the evidence as a whole, the FtT did not  accept  the
    appellant's claimed Christian conversion. His claim  to  be  uneducated
    and illiterate, was inconsistent  with  his  setting  up  a  commercial
    business in Iraq after returning to there (�38). His claim not to  have
    any contact with anyone in Iraq or the  IKR  was  also  not  believable
    (�39) and the FtT did not accept that the appellant would face  adverse
    interest from his family in Erbil. If he feared they would kill or harm
    him, as he claimed, he would not have moved only 45  minutes  away  and
    lived so close by for many years.

 8. At �40, the FtT did not accept as credible the appellant's  account  of
    conversion on Christmas Day in 2009, in the context  of  little  or  no
    knowledge of Christianity and immediate conversion on the same day. The
    FtT also rejected at �41 the appellant's  claim  to  have  moved  to  a
    neighbouring Christian town. At �42, the FtT rejected  the  appellant's
    account of leaving Iraq because of a fear of  ISIS.   Instead,  despite
    claiming asylum in other  countries,  his  real  determination  was  to
    travel to the UK. At �43, the FtT noted the appellant's claim that  his
    wife and also converted to Christianity,  but  there  was  no  detailed
    evidence about her conversion, nor had she given evidence.

 9. At �44, the  FtT  analysed  the  evidence  of  fellow  churchgoers  and
    notwithstanding the genuineness of their belief,  did  not  accept  the
    appellant had converted, noting the clear language difficulties between
    the witnesses and the appellant and  the  little  evidence  faith.  The
    appellant's account of being unable to openly practice his faith in the
    IKR was inconsistent with the appellant's own expert evidence.

10. At �45, the FtT concluded that the appellant  was  living  in  the  IKR
    prior to leaving Iraq and had not lost touch with his family,  or  that
    they  had  threatened  him  because  of  his  claimed   conversion   to
    Christianity.

11. The FtT concluded at �47 that the appellant could return  to  Iraq  via
    Baghdad noting the country guidance cases of AA(Iraq) [2017]  EWCA  Civ
    944 and SMO, KSP & IM  (Article  15(c);  identity  documents)  Iraq  CG
    [2019] UKUT 00400 (IAC) .  The appellant could obtain his CSID from his
    relatives living in Erbil; or a new INID by proxy or his CSID could  be
    sent to him by his wife on her return to Iraq (�49).

12. At �51, in a brief analysis, the  respondent  rejected  any  claim  for
    humanitarian protection and also by reference to article 8 ECHR.



The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

13. The appellant  lodged  grounds  of  appeal  which  are  essentially  as
    follows:

      1. Ground (1) - the FtT had erred in law in rejecting the  appellant's
         account that his family had  turned  against  him  because  he  had
         converted to Christianity. The appellant had relied upon an  expert
         report of Alison Pargeter in support of that and  the  plausibility
         of the appellant moving to a Christian town and later, leaving Iraq
         because of ISIS control of that town. The FtT had failed to  engage
         with that expert  report.  In  particular,  whilst  there  were  no
         problems for Christians in general living in the IKR, the  FtT  had
         failed to recognise the difference in treatment of those  who  were
         born into  the  Christian  faith,  as  opposed  to  those  who  had
         converted.

      2. Ground (2) - the FtT had erred in finding that  the  appellant  was
         intelligent and therefore could not be uneducated or illiterate and
         that this somehow damaged his credibility.

      3. Ground (3) - the FtT had erred in concluding that the appellant had
         left his CSID in Erbil, because the FtT had misapplied the standard
         of proof in assessing whether it was "reasonably likely"  (see  the
         authority of Demirkaya v SSHD [1999] EWCA Civ 1654).

      4. Ground (4) - the FtT erred in concluding that the  appellant  could
         obtain his INID by proxy as this was contrary to the  authority  of
         SMO.

14. Permission to appeal to this Tribunal  was  initially  refused  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal on 29th December 2020 but granted by Upper Tribunal
    Judge O'Callaghan on 21st January 2021 in relation to grounds (1),  (3)
    and (4) only (he refused permission in respect of ground (2).  He noted
    that  the  materiality  of  Ms  Pargeter's  report  would  need  to  be
    identified.



The hearing before me

The appellant's submissions

15. Ms Khan emphasised that the FtT's bare reference to the  expert  report
    was not sufficient.  The  expert  report  crucially  had  distinguished
    between those of born into  the  Christian  faith  and  those  who  had
    converted to Christianity.  The FtT had stated at �39:

         "There is no evidence to assist me to conclude that the appellant's
         family turned against him because of his change of  faith,  to  the
         extent that they would kill him."

16. That reference was incorrect, as there was  evidence  before  the  FtT,
    specifically evidence from Ms Pargeter directly on  the  likelihood  or
    plausibility of the account that  the  appellant's  family  had  indeed
    turned against him.  The reference therefore there to there  being  "no
    evidence" was strongly indicative of  the  FtT  having  not  considered
    adequately the expert report of Ms Pargeter, whose  expertise  was  not
    challenged.

17. Similarly at �41 the FtT had stated:

         "Background material including that in the appellant's  own  expert
         report suggests that there  are  no  significant  difficulties  for
         Christians living in the  IKR.  Bearing  in  mind  that  I  am  not
         satisfied that the appellant was at real risk of  serious  harm  at
         the hands of his own family and that his almost instant  conversion
         to  Christianity  is  unbelievable,  the  move  to  [the  Christian
         majority town] is not likely to be reasonably likely."

18. The flaw  was  the  reference  to  background  material  suggesting  no
    difficulties for Christians living in IKR.  Put simply, in section 3 of
    her report, Ms Pargeter had suggested an  absence  of  persecution  for
    Christians generally, but at section 4, had identified particular risks
    to converts, including from family members  whom  she  described  might
    plausibly be outraged at the conversion of family members.

19. Continuing at �45, whilst the FtT noted that the appellant had  claimed
    that he would be unable to openly practise his faith in  the  IKR,  but
    said this was inconsistent with Ms Pargeter's report,  once  again  the
    FtT had ignored the part of her report which assessed  the  appellant's
    claim as consistent with the background evidence that  converts  would,
    out of fear, hide their conversion and the practice of their faith.

20. In summary, the FtT had failed to engage with  the  expert  report  and
    explain what weight he had attached to it.     Ms  Khan,  who  appeared
    before the FtT, had specifically referred to the report in her  written
    skeleton argument to the FtT.   The report  was  also  consistent  with
    other background material before the FtT, at pages [22], [23], [91]  to
    [93] of the FtT's bundle, all of which dealt with particular  risks  to
    Christian converts and the final section dealing with particular  risks
    to women, in the context of the appellant's wife's claim also  to  have
    converted.   Ground (1) was sufficiently material on its  own,  as  the
    assessment of appellant's credibility was a nuanced one and  a  failure
    to engage with that aspect of the credibility meant that  the  entirety
    of the assessment was flawed.  That being said,  grounds  (3)  and  (4)
    were additional, compounding errors.

21. In relation to ground (3), the FtT had  mistakenly  inferred  from  the
    appellant's acceptance, in the skeleton argument before the  FtT,  that
    the appellant was likely to have left his CSID card  in  the  Christian
    majority town, that he had  left  it  with  family  members  who  lived
    elsewhere in Erbil.  In doing so, the FtT had applied an  impermissibly
    low standard to reach his finding.

22. Regarding ground (4), the error in finding  that  the  appellant  could
    obtain an INID by proxy, which was clearly inconsistent with SMO, would
    be immaterial if the appellant were still in contact, and did not  have
    adverse relations, with family members, who could obtain a CSID, but if
    the appellant in fact had an estranged relationship  and  feared  them,
    then that was where the error became material.



The Respondent's submissions

23. Ms Isherwood urged me to consider  that  what  the  appellant  had  not
    challenged was the central assessment by the FtT of his credibility and
    in that regard, she took me to �40 of the FtT's decision and  what  the
    FtT assessed  as  a  wholly  implausible  account  of  the  appellant's
    conversion on Christmas  Day  in  2009.   When  I  asked  Ms  Isherwood
    whether, to take that in isolation from the expert report,  a  Tribunal
    might fall in to the error identified in Mibanga v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ
    367, she submitted that the FtT's analysis of credibility had  been  in
    the context of background evidence, see: ��41  and  45.   The  FtT  had
    properly considered all of the evidence in the round and  was  entitled
    to conclude as he did at ��48 to 49 that appellant had not  fallen  out
    with family members and could obtain his CSID card and  correspondingly
    return to Iraq.  She, like Ms Khan accepted that grounds  (3)  and  (4)
    effectively compounded any error, if there were one, on  the  basis  of
    ground (1) and to the extent that ground (1) was made  out,  the  FtT's
    decision would be unsafe.



The appellant's response

24. On a final point, Ms Khan pointed out that at �4 of ground (1), she had
    made clear  that  all  of  the  FtT's  assessment  of  the  appellant's
    credibility, including ��39 to 42  of  the  FtT's  decision,  had  been
    challenged.



Discussion and conclusions

25. On the one hand I am very conscious that I do not have the  opportunity
    to assess all of the  evidence  before  me  as  the  FtT  has  had  the
    opportunity to do so and I am confined to considering whether  the  FtT
    erred  in  law.   I  am  equally  conscious  that  the  assessment   of
    credibility is  a  sensitive  and  nuanced  one  and  that  it  is  not
    appropriate to take particular elements of reasoning  out  of  context,
    when considering whether there is an error of law.   Nevertheless  both
    representatives have accepted that at the core of this  appeal  is  the
    appellant's credibility.  I am satisfied that the FtT's analysis of the
    appellant's credibility was fundamentally flawed.  The FtT acknowledged
    the expert report in specific ways,  in  parts  of  his  decision:  for
    example at �13, to emphasise that Christians living in the IKR were not
    persecuted (see �3.11 of the report of Ms Pargeter).

26. What is also clear on the face of Ms Pargeter's  report  is  her  clear
    distinction between the  risk  to  Christians  generally  (section  3);
    specifically to  converts (section 4); and her  specific  consideration
    of the appellant's account, and its consistency with her  knowledge  of
    the background evidence, including his account of the  outrage  of  his
    family at his conversion (�5.2);  the  outrage  of  his  wife's  family
    (�5.3); his move to a nearby Christian majority town  (�5.4);  and  the
    subsequent destruction of that town at �5.5.  It may  well  be  that  a
    Tribunal  reconsidering  the  appeal  decides  nevertheless  that   the
    appellant's account remains implausible and not credible, taking all of
    the evidence as a whole, but I accept the force of Ms Khan's submission
    that the FtT, while referring to the report by reference to  Christians
    in the IKR, makes no analysis of the other elements, set out above,  of
    Ms Pargeter's detailed report.  Instead, there is statement at �39 that
    there was no evidence that the appellant's family  had  turned  against
    him, when Ms Pargeter had specifically  addressed  that  issue;  and  a
    reference at  �41  to  background  reports  suggesting  no  significant
    difficulties for Christians living in IKR, which, while consistent with
    �3.11 of the report, does not deal in any sense  with  sections  4  and
    section 5. The FtT's conclusion at �45  that  the  appellant's  claimed
    fear of worshiping freely in the IKR appeared to be out of step with Ms
    Pargeter's evidenced does not explain why it is out of step, and indeed
    appears at odds with the report.

27. I am satisfied that given the extent of  the  lack  of  engagement  and
    analysis of the report, which must be considered in the round  and  not
    in isolation from  the  remainder  of  the  evidence,  that  the  FtT's
    analysis of the appellant's credibility was fundamentally flawed.   The
    appellant's appeal succeeds on the basis of ground (1) alone.

28. I accept that the error in ground (1) was compounded by the  errors  in
    grounds (3) and (4).  Ground (3) relates to the finding of whether  the
    appellant would have left his CSID in Iraq, which could be sent to  him
    by relatives. It does appear that the appellant's concession  that  his
    account of leaving his CSID in Iraq  (noting  that  he  left  from  the
    Christian majority town) conflates that  statement  with  a  conclusion
    that he has left it where it could be accessed and returned to  him  by
    family members, ignoring the claimed destruction of the town he left.

29. Ground (4) relates to the erroneous finding  that  INID  cards  can  be
    obtained by proxy, which Ms Isherwood  did  not  seek  to  contend  was
    consistent with SMO - rather, the issue was around materiality, if  the
    appellant's CSID could be obtained.     Given the errors in grounds (1)
    and (3), I am satisfied that the error in ground (4) was also material.



30. In conclusion, grounds (1), (3) and (4) disclose material errors in the
    FtT's findings on the appellant's credibility.  Those findings and  the
    FtT's decision are unsafe and cannot stand.



Decision on error of law

31. In my view there are material errors here and  I  must  set  the  FtT's
    decision aside, without any preserved findings of fact.



Disposal

32. With reference to paragraph 7.2  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Statement and the necessary fact-finding, this is clearly a  case  that
    has to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a complete rehearing.



33. The remittal shall involve a complete  rehearing  of  the  appeal.  All
    aspects of the claims must be addressed.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law  and
I set it aside, without preserved findings of fact.

I remit this appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for a complete rehearing.



Directions to the First-tier Tribunal

This appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal,  Manchester  Piccadilly,
for a complete rehearing with no preserved findings of fact.

The remitted  appeal  shall  not  be  heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
Garratt.

The anonymity directions continue to apply.
