Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms K Smith, instructed by Immigration Advice Service
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Bahman Ibrahim, date of birth 21.3.96, is a  citizen  of
    Iran.

 2. He appealed against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Myers
    promulgated 24.3.15, dismissing on all grounds his appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of  State,  dated  22.11.14,  to  refuse  his
    international protection and human rights claims.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Garratt  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    16.4.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 8.10.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The matter was listed for an error of law hearing only,  and
    the request for an interpreter had thus been cancelled.

 5. For the reasons set out in my error of law decision, I found such error
    of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  such
    that the decision of Judge Myers should be set aside and remade in  the
    Upper Tribunal. In brief, I found that the First-tier  Tribunal  failed
    to properly or adequately consider the SB Iran risks on return  and  in
    particular that being caught smuggling alcohol  could  be  regarded  as
    anti-Islamic conduct and thus amount to a significant  risk  factor  as
    specified in �53(v) of SB Iran. I also found that the judge  failed  to
    give any  consideration  as  to  prison  conditions  in  Iran,  if  the
    appellant were to be imprisoned for the offence of  smuggling  alcohol;
    an issue that was not addressed at all in the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

 6. I thus adjourned the remaking of the decision in the appeal to be heard
    by myself in the Upper Tribunal at Manchester, giving directions as set
    out in the error of law decision.

 7. In particular, as agreed by the representatives of both parties at  the
    error of law hearing, I preserved the primary facts found by the First-
    tier Tribunal. In summary, these include that  the  appellant  was  not
    involved in smuggling political  material  and  has  no  valid  imputed
    political opinion claim.  However,  he  was  ambushed  by  the  Iranian
    authorities which engaged in smuggling alcohol. That he is  of  Kurdish
    ethnicity and that he fled  Iran  illegally  are  relevant  aggravating
    factors.

 8. It was not clear  to  me  that  any  further  oral  evidence  would  be
    necessary, but I gave leave  for  further  background  evidence  to  be
    produced on the issue of whether smuggling alcohol would be regarded as
    anti-Islamic activity and punishable by imprisonment and in relation to
    likely prison conditions.

 9. At the continuation hearing  before  me,  there  was  no  further  oral
    evidence, but Ms Smith relied on the  recently  served  expert  opinion
    report of Dr Kakhki, dated 26.11.15. In summary, this confirms, at some
    length and  with  many  examples,  that  smuggling  alcohol  is  indeed
    regarded as anti-Islamic activity and prosecuted by  the  criminal  law
    with likely imprisonment. Smuggling alcohol attracts harsher punishment
    than mere smuggling, because it is also anti-Islamic.  Dr  Kakhki  also
    recites ample background evidence  that  there  is  widespread  use  of
    torture by the authorities and the fact that he left Iran illegally and
    is of Kurdish ethnicity would be aggravating features likely to lead to
    a harsher sentence.

10. At �60 Dr Kakhki concludes, "In my opinion, if Mr  Ibrahim  was  to  be
    returned to Iran, he would be arrested and interrogated in relation  to
    his smuggling of alcoholic beverages and other items, as  well  as  for
    his illegal departure from  Iran.  Any  investigation  carried  out  to
    determine his liability would likely involved harsh methods,  with  the
    possible use of torture to extract information."

11.  I  accept  that  expert  opinion  as  well-supported,  with  objective
    background material and cogent reasoning.

12. For his part Mr McVeety pointed to 3.13 and 3.17 of the  relevant  OGN,
    which confirms that smugglers of alcohol are liable to imprisonment and
    that prison conditions are generally harsh and life-threatening, likely
    to give rise to a breach of article 3 ECHR.

13. In the circumstances, whilst Mr McVeety did not concede the  point,  he
    felt unable to resist the appeal on humanitarian  protection  or  human
    rights grounds with any real force, which was sensible and realistic.

14. I thus find that whilst dismissing the asylum claim, there  is  a  real
    risk on return of the appellant being  arrested,  tortured,  imprisoned
    and mistreated because he was caught smuggling alcohol into  Iran,  and
    that he would thereby suffer serious harm, sufficient to meet the lower
    standard of proof and entitle him to humanitarian protection.

15. In the alternative, I also find that his return would place the  UK  in
    breach of the prohibition on torture, or inhuman or degrading treatment
    or punishment, in breach of rights under article 3 ECHR.

Decision:

16. The appeal is dismissed on asylum grounds;

17. The appeal is allowed on humanitarian protection grounds;

18. In the alternative, if it were necessary,  I  would  have  allowed  the
    appeal on human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make such an order. Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
