(ANONYMITY DIRECTION made)

and



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

Respondent





Representation:

	For the Appellant:	Mr Hussain, instructed by Halliday Reeves Law Firm

	For the Respondent:	Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer 

	

	

	DECISION AND REASONS

The appellant, AA, was born in 1992 and is a citizen of Sudan.  Before the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Atkinson) the Secretary of State agreed that the appellant was of Sudanese nationality and was also a member of the Fur tribe.  The judge relied on existing country guidance cases: AA (Sudan) CG [2009] UKAIT 0056: MM (Darfuris) Sudan CG [2015] UKUT 0010 and IM and AL (Sudan) CG UKUT [2016] 00188.  In essence, the Secretary of State challenges the judge’s decision to allow the appeal arguing that the judge should have departed from the country guidance as he had sufficient evidence before m adduced by the Secretary of State to do so.

Before the Upper Tribunal, Mr McVeety, who appeared for the Secretary of State, did not seek to support the grounds of appeal.  He told me that he believed that he would be unable to persuade me that the judge erred in law by following the existing country guidance.  I am grateful to Mr McVeety and, in the circumstances, make a decision dismissing the Secretary of State’s appeal.

Notice of Decision



This appeal is dismissed.
