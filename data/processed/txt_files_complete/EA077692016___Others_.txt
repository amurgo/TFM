                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction

 1. The appellants are citizens of Bangladesh  whose  dates  of  birth  are
    recorded as 5 October 1977, 10 December  1984  and  16  September  2011
    respectively. They made an application to the Secretary of State for an
    EEA residence card.  The application was refused in a  decision  served
    on 10 June 2016, for reasons that I need not set out herein.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 2. The appellants lodged an appeal before the FtT. That appeal came before
    FtT Judge Zucker, who concluded in a decision dated 4 August 2017, that
    the FtT did not have jurisdiction to determine the appeal. No  findings
    were made in relation to the  substance  of  the  appeal.  The  Judge's
    conclusion was informed by the guidance given by this Tribunal in  Sala
    [2016] UKUT 00411.

 3. The appellant appealed such decision to  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  FtT
    Judge Baker granted permission, decision dated 29 January 2018.

Directions by Upper Tribunal

 4. In a notice of decision dated  27  February  2018  UT  Judge  Rimington
    indicated that the Upper Tribunal was minded to find an error  of  law,
    set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and remit the case to
    the First-tier Tribunal. If either of the parties was opposed  to  this
    course they were directed to inform the  Tribunal  in  writing  (giving
    reasons), not later than 7 days  from  the  date  the  Directions  were
    issued. Following that period, the parties were informed that the Upper
    Tribunal would issue its decision.

Discussion

 5. The Upper Tribunal has received  correspondence  from  the  appellant's
    solicitor and from the Home Office stating that they are  in  agreement
    with the case being remitted to the FtT.

 6. The Court of Appeal has given consideration to the very issue  in  play
    in the instant case - see Khan  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755. The Court  concluded  that  the  Upper
    Tribunal had been wrong in its conclusion and rationale in Sala.  It is
    not in dispute that the effect of the decision in Khan, if  applied  to
    this case, is that the First-tier Tribunal was wrong to  conclude  that
    it did not have jurisdiction in this appeal.

 7. For this reason, I set aside the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    and remit the appeal back  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  be  heard
    afresh.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.


Signed:                                               Dated: 18th April
2018
