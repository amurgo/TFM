Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms D Revill, instructed by Queen's Park Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  ECO  and  the
    Respondent is referred to as the Claimant.

2.   The Claimant, a national of Sierra Leone, date of birth  2  July  1997,
    appealed against the ECO's decision made on 2 November 2014  to  refuse
    entry  clearance  with  reference  to  paragraph   297(i)(f)   of   the
    Immigration Rules HC  395,  as  amended  (the  Rules),  and  also  with
    reference to paragraph 320(7A) of the Rules.  It  was  alleged  that  a
    false document had been used and as a result of  that  the  matter  was
    rejected with reference to the use of  false  representations.   It  is
    also fair to say, although the reasoning is not  well-structured,  that
    the ECO gave some  reasons  at  least  for  rejecting  the  claim  with
    reference to Rule 297 of the Rules namely the Claimant was  not  living
    in serious and compelling family or  other  considerations  which  make
    exclusion of the Claimant undesirable.

3.   The appeal against that decision came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    J Bartlett (the Judge) who, on 10 March 2016, allowed the appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules.   It  was  not  conceded  that  the  appeal  was
    confined to paragraph 320(7A) of the Rules. The judge said at paragraph
    13, [D13] "In relation to the part of the proceedings relating to  para
    297(i)(f) the normal burden of the  balance  of  probabilities  is  the
    correct burden and this lies on the Respondent".  The judge [D6]  said,
    having "clarified" the issues with the Claimant's Counsel, Mr Jafar,

         "... He agreed that these were as  to  whether  the  appellant  had
         committed fraud by submitting fraudulent documents and  only  if  I
         found there was fraud would Immigration Rules 297(i)(f) need to  be
         decided".

    If Mr Jafar did submit that  he  is  wrong  or  it  may  be  the  judge
    misunderstood him: This may explain in part why the decision goes badly
    wrong.

4.   Putting to one side those  errors  the  judge,  finally  concluded  the
    unfortunate exercise, and found that paragraph 320(7A) of the Rules was
    not engaged: a matter which the ECO does not challenge.  The judge said
    [D14], this:

         "As I have found that paragraph 320(7A) is not made out I  have  no
         need to consider paragraph 297(i)(f) of the Rules".


    However the judge allowed the appeal under the  Immigration  Rules  and
    seemingly must have done so on the basis of the application being  made
    under 297(i)(f) of the Immigration Rules with reference to  series  and
    compelling family or other considerations engaged nor with reference to
    paragraph 297(ii) - (vii) of the Rules.  It  is  extremely  unfortunate
    that this should have happened and it is a matter to be  regretted  but
    unfortunately the judge also did not go on to consider whether  or  not
    any of the matters raised by paragraph  297(ii)-(vii)  applied.   There
    has thus been no proper consideration of paragraph 297  of  the  Rules.
    It is clear that the ECO is not challenging  the  judge's  findings  in
    paragraph 320(7A) of the rules.  I find that there are errors of law by
    the judge and unfortunately the matter will have to be returned to  the
    First-tier Tribunal to be determined in accordance with the law.


    5.    The Original Tribunal's decision cannot stand. The appeal  should
    be remade in the First-tier Tribunal.

DIRECTIONS
1.   Remake in the First-tier Tribunal.
2.   Time limit 1ï¿½ hours.
3.   No interpreter required.
4.   No further evidence to be served unless leave is  given  at  a  further
    case management hearing.
5.   The findings of the judge of the Original Tribunal on  paragraph  3207A
    of the Rules to stand.  The issue to be addressed is paragraph  297  of
    the Rules.
6.   Please re-list before any First-tier Tribunal Judge other  than  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge J Bartlett.

ANONYMITY
No anonymity order was made or none sought.
