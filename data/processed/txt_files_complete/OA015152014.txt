Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Taimour Lay, Counsel instructed by Tower Hamlets
                    Law Centre
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal  against  a  decision  by  an
    Entry Clearance Officer to refuse to issue him with entry clearance  as
    the spouse of a  person  present  and  settled  here.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do  not  consider
    that the appellant should be accorded anonymity for  these  proceedings
    in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a national of Somalia,  whose  date  of  birth  is  24
    January 1953.  In December 2013 he applied  for  entry  clearance  from
    Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.  In his application form, he said he had resided
    at his current address in Addis Ababa for three years.  He had come  to
    Ethiopia in 2009 due to the civil war  in  Somalia.   His  sponsor  was
    Amina Abdi Ali, a British national whose date of birth  is  1  February
    1949.  She had been born in Somalia, and had  been  living  in  the  UK
    since 20 April 2002.

 3.  In  a  covering  letter  dated  26  September  2013,  the  appellant's
    representatives, Tower Hamlets Law Centre, said that the appellant  had
    married the sponsor on 18 July 2012.  Mrs Ali had met  her  husband  in
    June 2012 when visiting Ethiopia.   The  appellant  was  known  to  the
    sponsor's mother, and she had introduced them.  He  had  lost  all  his
    family during the war in Somalia, and he suffered from  post  traumatic
    stress and depression as a result of this.  The sponsor  was  keen  for
    the appellant to join her in the UK so she could look  after  him,  and
    with her love  and  support  to  encourage  him  to  recover  from  his
    depression and PTSD.  Mrs Ali's previous marriage had ended by  divorce
    on 7 May 2010.  The appellant would be adequately maintained by Mrs Ali
    in the UK.  She did not work as she cared  for  her  disabled  son  who
    required full-time care.  She  was  in  receipt  of  disability  living
    allowance on his behalf, amounting  to  �100.15  per  week.   She  also
    received a carer's allowance in the amount of �58.45 per week.  Under E-
    ECP.3.3, she  was  exempt  from  the  minimum  income  threshold.   She
    intended to use the DLA and the carer's allowance that she received  in
    order to support the appellant as well as her son.  She had provided  a
    tenancy agreement  confirming  that  her  council  property  had  three
    bedrooms.  It also had a separate living room.  She  lived  there  with
    her two adult sons (one of whom was her disabled son).

 4. On the topic of the English language requirement, they were  instructed
    that as a result of the appellant's mental condition he was  unable  to
    meet this requirement and so he requested an exemption on  this  basis.
    A medical report was attached.

 5. Under the heading of Article 8 ECHR, they said that Mrs Ali's  disabled
    son had a severe learning disability and autism,  which  manifested  in
    severe communication and behavioural difficulties.   He  also  suffered
    from severe physical problems  including  severe  reflux  oesophagitis.
    She cared for her son in all aspects of daily  living,  which  included
    feeding him, helping him to bathe and go to the toilet, giving him  his
    medication and sitting with him,  and  talking  to  him  and  generally
    keeping a close eye on him.  She was therefore unable to leave  him  on
    his own.  When she travelled to Ethiopia, she had to take him with  her
    and this was quite difficult for him to cope with.  So she had not been
    able to consider further trips to Ethiopia to visit her  husband.   For
    the above reasons, she  would  not  be  able  to  live  permanently  in
    Ethiopia with her husband, and this was an insurmountable  obstacle  to
    family life taking place there.

The Reasons for Refusal

 6. On 16 December  2013  an  Entry  Clearance  Officer  in  Nairobi  (post
    reference  Nairobi\440289)  gave   his   reasons   for   refusing   the
    application.  He  claimed  to  be  exempt  from  the  English  language
    requirement as he had schizophrenia.  He had  submitted  a  copy  of  a
    letter from the Bole Higher Clinic in Addis Ababa  which  said  he  had
    schizophrenia.   But  he  had  not  provided  the  original  letter  as
    required.  The letter was of a format easily produced at a low cost and
    did not satisfy him that it was produced by a medical  professional  as
    claimed.  He was not satisfied therefore that  he  had  a  physical  or
    mental condition which would prevent him from meeting the  requirement.
    He also noted the letter did not  say  that  he  was  unable  to  learn
    English.  So he was not  satisfied  he  was  exempt  from  the  English
    language requirement under paragraph E-ECP.4.2.   His  application  was
    therefore refused under paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Rules.

 7. He also considered whether his  application  raised  or  contained  any
    exceptional circumstances which, consistent with the right  to  respect
    for  family  life  contained  in  Article   8   ECHR,   might   warrant
    consideration by the Secretary of State of a grant of  entry  clearance
    to come to the United Kingdom outside the requirements  of  the  Rules.
    He had decided that it did not.

The Grounds of Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 8. In the grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, it was argued that
    the Entry Clearance Officer had erred in  law  or  failed  to  exercise
    discretion  appropriately.   Verification  from  the  doctor  "will  be
    obtained" with an explanation regarding the  appellant's  inability  to
    learn English as a result of his medical condition.

The Entry Clearance Manager's Review

 9. On 17 March 2014 an  Entry  Clearance  Manager  gave  his  reasons  for
    upholding the refusal decision.  The sponsor had lived in Ethiopia  for
    three years where English  language  facilities  were  available.   The
    appellant had not provided any other evidence of  his  claimed  medical
    condition which made him exempt from the English language  requirement.
    The original medical  letter  from  Bole  Clinic  had  still  not  been
    provided.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

10. The appellant's appeal came before Judge McDade sitting at Taylor House
    in the First-tier Tribunal on  4  December  2014.   The  appellant  was
    represented by Mr Lay of Counsel, and the Entry Clearance  Officer  was
    represented by a Presenting Officer.

11. In addition to the medical certificate provided with  the  application,
    which was dated 15 November 2013, reliance was placed  on  two  further
    certificates.

12. Page 4 of the appellant's bundle was a copy of  a  medical  certificate
    purportedly issued by  Bole  Higher  Clinic  on  28  January  2014.  It
    certified that the patient had been examined on that day, and  that  he
    had poor concentration and was unable to remember so it  was  difficult
    for him to retain languages.

13. Another document which was handed up loose  was  a  document  dated  27
    October 2014 purportedly emanating from Dr Tefera  Muche,  psychiatrist
    at the Bole Higher Clinic.  He said that the patient was having follow-
    up at the clinic with chief complaints of poor sleep, poor appetite and
    "talking alone of long duration".  At the same time he  was  forgetful.
    There was no family history of  mental  illness.   On  a  mental  state
    examination, his speech was coherent, he had good eye contact,  and  he
    denied any hallucinations and delusions.  He had no  cognitive  deficit
    and had insight.  The "impression" was that he had schizophrenia.   The
    treatment that he was receiving was Chlorpromazine  100mg  at  bedtime.
    Dr Muche concluded by saying that because  of  his  mental  problem  he
    could not concentrate due  to  the  fact  that  he  did  not  have  any
    attention and concentration.

14. The judge received oral evidence from the sponsor.

15. In his subsequent decision, he addressed the English language exemption
    question at paragraph [3].  He did not find Mrs Ali to be  an  entirely
    straightforward or satisfactory witness.  The appellant's case was that
    he was incapable of successfully completing an  English  language  test
    because he suffered from schizophrenia.  The sponsor did not give  oral
    evidence that she had witnessed her husband manifest any symptoms while
    she was with him, only that he was not  sleeping  or  eating  properly.
    She stated that these problems resolved as soon as  he  was  placed  on
    medication.

16. As far as the documents that purported  to  be  medical  evidence  were
    concerned, he considered them to be wholly unreliable.   The  appellant
    was said to have submitted an original of the medical certificate dated
    15 November 2013, but there was  no  evidence  that  any  original  was
    attached to the application.  He found that the doctor's recommendation
    on the certificate was "somewhat curious".  It  was  more  designed  to
    assist the appellant's application than to outline any treatment plan.

17. So far as documents 2 and 3 were  concerned  (the  documents  dated  28
    January and 27 October 2014, it was conceded that no originals  of  the
    documents had been provided.  He  noted  that  the  document  dated  28
    January 2014 said nothing about his schizophrenia.  The third  document
    gave no diagnosis of schizophrenia, but gave an "impression"  of  such.
    Again there were no symptoms of  schizophrenia  discussed.   The  judge
    concluded:

         I am not persuaded that these documents taken together go  any  way
         to suggest the  appellant  does  suffer  from  schizophrenia.   The
         methodology used to reach such a diagnosis appears  woolly  in  the
         extreme.  In all the circumstances I can give  these  documents  no
         weight and I hold, to the requisite standard, that the appellant is
         not incapacitated as claimed but  there  is  no  reliable  evidence
         before me to enable me to conclude that he is mentally incapable of
         undertaking an English language test.

18. The judge went on to address an alternative submission  that,  even  if
    the English language test was not satisfied,  the  appellant  qualified
    for entry clearance under Section EX.1(b) of Appendix FM  in  that  the
    appellant had a genuine and subsisting relationship with his wife,  and
    there were insurmountable obstacles to family  life  with  his  partner
    continuing outside the UK.

19. The judge acknowledged that the sponsor had a 21 year old dependant who
    had severe physical and mental problems, and that she assisted him with
    his care.  But in her oral evidence she stated that social services did
    everything for him, and it was only after  prompting  that  she  stated
    that she helped to  wash  and  dress  him.   He  also  noted  that  the
    sponsor's other son also assisted his  brother  with  his  care  needs.
    While there was a level of dependency between the sponsor and her  son,
    she did not undertake the majority of his care.  He fully  acknowledged
    that were the sponsor to relocate to Ethiopia,  this  would  cause  her
    disabled son difficulties, perhaps more emotionally than physically.

20. The judge considered it was important to  look  at  the  facts  of  the
    relationship between the appellant  and  his  wife.   These  were  that
    having arrived in Ethiopia on 29 June 2012 and  never  having  met  her
    future husband nor having any intention to do so and on the basis  that
    he had been helpful to her with her baggage from the airport, some  two
    weeks later she  married  him.   Four  weeks  after  the  marriage  she
    returned to the United Kingdom, and neither party had had  face-to-face
    contact with each other since.  There was no evidence of any  exchanges
    of greeting cards or photographs or anything else other than  producing
    a phone bill in evidence to show that phone  calls  had  been  made  to
    various numbers in Addis Ababa to one number more than others.  As  far
    as evidence of remittances  from  the  appellant  to  Addis  Ababa  was
    concerned, none of these had gone to the appellant.  Moreover he  noted
    that most of them were sent in 2014,  and  none  more  than  one  month
    before the application.

21. The judge concluded that any tenuous bond between the appellant and her
    husband that might have existed in the five weeks or so that  they  had
    face-to-face contact with each other in Ethiopia had been  weakened  by
    the absence of  any  face-to-face  contact  between  them  since.   The
    sponsor could have gone to visit her husband in Ethiopia if she  wanted
    to, but she chose not to do so.  She did take her son with her  on  the
    last occasion, and so there appeared to be no reason why she could  not
    have done so on this occasion if she felt that were necessary.

22. He held that whilst the  marriage  existed  on  paper,  it  was  not  a
    subsisting one in terms of emotional support; and  that  the  financial
    support would  be  unlikely  to  be  sustained  were  it  not  for  the
    application and subsequent  appeal.   He  considered  the  evidence  of
    financial support to be wholly self-serving.

23. There was no good or sufficient reason to go on to consider Article  8.
    But if he were to do so, he would hold that there was  no  family  life
    between the appellant and her  husband,  and  so  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's decision could not therefore be seen to  be  an  interference
    with it.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

24. Mr Lay settled the appellant's application for permission to appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal.  Ground 1 was that in finding there was  no  family
    life between the appellant and his wife in the UK, the judge had failed
    to have regard to material evidence and/or had  treated  the  available
    evidence in an irrational way.

25. Ground 2 was that  there  was  procedural  unfairness  arising  from  a
    failure to raise the question of the genuineness of the marriage in the
    course of the hearing so that the appellant's spouse could deal with it
    in her evidence.

26. Ground 3 was that the judge had erred in his approach  to  E-ECP.4.2(b)
    and/or the medical evidence.  The medical reports did establish to  the
    requisite standard that the appellant had  a  disability  (physical  or
    mental condition) which prevented him from meeting the English language
    requirement.  By focusing solely on whether or not the appellant had  a
    diagnosis of schizophrenia,  the  judge  had  not  had  regard  to  the
    symptoms ascribed in the medical reports, the  prescription  medication
    that the appellant was taking, and the oral and written evidence of the
    appellant's wife as to the appellant's inability to sleep,  concentrate
    and learn.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

27.  On  26  February  2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Osborne   granted
    permission to appeal on all grounds raised.

The Error of Law Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

28. At the hearing before me to determine whether there  was  an  error  of
    law, Ms Fijiwala submitted that there was no error of law in the  judge
    finding that the appellant had not discharged  the  burden  of  proving
    that he was exempt from the English language requirement. But the judge
    had been wrong to go on to consider  in  the  alternative  whether  the
    requirements of EX.1(b) were met.  EX.1 was  parasitic,  and  a  person
    seeking entry clearance could not take advantage of it.   She  produced
    an archive version of the Rules in force at the date of decision, which
    showed that EX.1 was not listed as a potential  ground  of  eligibility
    for entry clearance, whereas it was listed as  a  potential  ground  of
    eligibility for leave to remain.

29. Ms Fijiwala conceded that the judge had also been wrong to make adverse
    findings about the subsistence of the marriage.

30. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Lay maintained the judge had  adopted  a
    too narrow approach to  E-ECP.4.2(b).   He  also  queried  whether  the
    appellant could not take the benefit of EX.1(b), although he recognised
    that the decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Clive Lane in  appeal  number
    OA/04256/2013 promulgated on 30 April  2014  (unreported  but  publicly
    accessible on the Upper Tribunal  website)  was  against  him  on  this
    question.

31. I ruled in favour of the respondent on ground 3 and in  favour  of  the
    appellant on ground 2.  My reasons are set out below.   As  credibility
    was in issue, and the appellant had not received a fair hearing on  his
    alternative  Article  8  claim,  I  was  satisfied  that  this  was  an
    appropriate case for remittal to the First-tier Tribunal for a de  novo
    hearing on the appellant's Article  8  claim.   Both  parties  were  in
    agreement that this was the appropriate course.

Reasons for Finding no Error of Law in the Dismissal  of  the  Appeal  under
the Rules

32. In  order  to  show  that  he  is  exempt  from  the  English  language
    requirement, the appellant had to show that at the date of  application
    he had a disability (physical or mental condition) which prevented  him
    from  meeting  the  requirement;  or  that   there   were   exceptional
    circumstances  which  prevented  him  from  being  able  to  meet   the
    requirement prior to his entry to the UK.

33. I consider the  judge  gave  adequate  reasons  for  finding  that  the
    appellant had not discharged this burden.  He clearly took into account
    all the evidence which  bore  upon  this  issue,  which  was  the  oral
    evidence of the sponsor, the contents of the  three  medical  documents
    relied upon, and also the fact that they were all copies. They thus did
    not have the probative value of original documents.

34. It was accepted by the appellant's representative that the  second  and
    third documents were copies, and it was open to the judge  to  draw  an
    adverse  inference  from  the  fact  that  no  attempt  had  been  made
    apparently to produce the originals for inspection.  The appellant  had
    apparently obtained the second and third documents from the clinic, and
    had sent copies of them to his wife as e-mail attachments.  On the face
    of it, there was no reason why  he  could  not  also  have  posted  the
    asserted  original  documents  to  the  sponsor   or   to   his   legal
    representatives in the UK.  As to the first document, it  was  asserted
    that the original had been provided to the Entry Clearance Officer, but
    this was disputed by the Entry Clearance Officer.   As  the  burden  of
    proof rested with the appellant, it was open to the judge  to  find  on
    the balance of probabilities that the original of  the  first  document
    had not been provided to the Entry Clearance Officer.

35. It was clearly open  to  the  judge  to  find  that  the  diagnosis  of
    schizophrenia was not satisfactorily or  credibly  explained,  for  the
    reasons  he  gave.   Mr  Lay's  argument  is  that  the  judge   should
    nonetheless have found that the appellant came within subparagraph  (b)
    in the light of the additional information provided about his condition
    in the second and third documents, in particular the  information  that
    the appellant found it difficult to concentrate  as  a  result  of  his
    mental condition,  even  if  the  mental  condition  was  not  in  fact
    schizophrenia.

36. It was open to the  judge  to  find  that  the  "woolly  diagnosis"  of
    schizophrenia undermined the general  credibility  of  everything  said
    about  the  appellant's  condition  and   symptoms   in   the   medical
    certificates.  Indeed, given the judge's concerns about the failure  to
    provide originals and the evidence of the sponsor, it is  difficult  to
    see how the judge could have rejected the  diagnosis  of  schizophrenia
    while at  the  same  time  finding  that  the  appellant  had  credibly
    established to the required standard of proof that he had a  disability
    which prevented him from meeting the English language requirement.  The
    medical evidence did not purport to identify any other condition  apart
    from schizophrenia as giving rise to him having poor concentration  and
    being unable to remember.  At the same time, as the  judge  found,  the
    symptoms of poor  concentration  and  inability  to  remember  are  not
    symptoms of schizophrenia.  Moreover, as noted by the judge, the  third
    document spoke of  positive  and  normal  aspects  of  the  appellant's
    demeanour such as coherent speech, insight, no  cognitive  deficit  and
    denying any hallucinations and delusions.   On  the  face  of  it,  the
    psychiatrist has not observed the patient being forgetful or displaying
    poor concentration in the course of his mental state examination of the
    patient.

37. The significance of the oral evidence of the sponsor is that, according
    to her, the appellant's problems of not  sleeping  properly  or  eating
    properly resolved as soon as he was placed on medication.  As he was on
    medication before the date  of  application,  according  to  the  first
    document, the import of the sponsor's evidence is that he had recovered
    by the date of application.

38. For the above reasons, it was open  to  the  judge  to  find  that  the
    appellant had not discharged the burden of proving that he  was  exempt
    from  the  English  language  requirement  under  paragraph  E-ECP.4.2.
    Moreover, the judge gave adequate reasons for reaching this conclusion.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law  in  the  Disposal  of  the  Alternative
Claim under Article 8 ECHR

39. The judge erred in law in accepting Mr Lay's invitation to consider  in
    the alternative whether the appellant  qualified  for  leave  to  enter
    under EX.1.  EX.1 has no application in out of country entry  clearance
    cases.  In argument before me, Mr Lay questioned the logic of EX.1  not
    being available to applicants for entry clearance.  The short answer is
    that logic does not come into it.  The Rules simply do  not  enable  an
    out of country spouse to qualify for entry clearance on the alternative
    basis that there are insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  between
    the British national and the foreign spouse being  carried  on  outside
    the United Kingdom.  But it is  not  necessary  to  look  very  far  to
    discern the policy consideration which underlies the exclusion.   Where
    EX.1 is shown to apply, the applicant does not also have to  show  that
    the  interference  with  family  life  is  disproportionate.   So,   in
    excluding applicants  for  entry  clearance  from  invoking  EX.1,  the
    Secretary of State is  preserving  the  position  which  obtains  in  a
    freestanding proportionality assessment outside the  Rules:  namely,  a
    balancing of the gravity of the interference with family  life  against
    the public interest in firm and effective immigration  controls.   This
    is illustrated by the reasoning of Upper Tribunal Judge Clive  Lane  in
    the case of Thomas produced by Ms Fijiwala:

         This was an  application  for  entry  clearance  which  had  failed
         (narrowly) because of the couple's inability to meet the  financial
         requirements of the Immigration Rules.  As noted above,  the  judge
         appears to have been particularly influence by what he regarded  as
         the "totally unnecessary step" of the children of the  sponsor  ...
         having to abandon their studies in the United Kingdom in  order  to
         relocate to schools in New Zealand.  As Mrs Pettersen pointed  out,
         the Entry  Clearance  Officer  did  not  require  the  children  to
         undertake  that  step.   I  agree   with   her   submission   that,
         notwithstanding the requirement of decision makers to  have  regard
         to  the  promotion   of   family   life   as   well   as   avoiding
         disproportionate interference with it, the lives of the sponsor and
         her children in the United Kingdom had been altered in any  way  by
         the Entry Clearance Officer's refusal.  Considering Article 8 ECHR,
         the judge appears to have had no  regard  to  the  public  interest
         concerned with the management  of  immigration  control  manifested
         through the Immigration Rules which  contain  legitimate  financial
         requirements for those seeking to settled in the United Kingdom ...
         I repeat my observation above that the interference which had  been
         caused in the existing family lives of the appellant,  sponsor  and
         her children is negligible whilst  the  public  interest  concerned
         with excluding those individuals  from  the  United  Kingdom  [who]
         cannot satisfy the Immigration Rules is a strong one.  Whilst I  am
         sure that this family would wish to be living  together,  I  cannot
         see that the circumstances are especially  compelling  or  unusual.
         The proper course of action for this appellant is to make a further
         application for entry clearance as and when he is able to meet  the
         requirements of the Immigration Rules.

40. Although the appellant cannot avail himself of EX.1, if in  fact  there
    are insurmountable obstacles to him carrying on family  life  with  the
    sponsor  in  Ethiopia  this  is  a  relevant   consideration   in   the
    proportionality assessment outside the Rules. But it is not a  decisive
    one (as it is under the Rules).

41. The strength of the family life  tie  between  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor  is  also  a  relevant  consideration  in  the  proportionality
    assessment.  Having received oral evidence from  the  sponsor,  it  was
    open to the judge to raise a concern as to  whether  the  marriage  was
    subsisting.  Mr Lay acknowledged this in the course of argument.  Where
    the judge went wrong was not raising his concern at the hearing, so  as
    to give Mr Lay the opportunity to adduce further oral evidence from the
    sponsor and to address his concern in submissions.   The  evidence  for
    the hearing had not been prepared on the basis that the subsistence  of
    the marriage was going to be an issue.  So procedural fairness required
    that the judge's concern on this question should be flagged up  in  the
    course of the hearing.

42. In consequence, the appellant has been deprived of a  fair  hearing  in
    the First-tier Tribunal on his alternative claim under Article 8  ECHR.
    Thus the decision on the Article 8 claim  is  vitiated  by  a  material
    error of law, such that it should be set aside and remade.

Conclusion

43. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing the appeal under the
    Rules did not contain an error of law,  and  accordingly  the  decision
    stands.

44. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the  alternative
    claim under Article 8 ECHR contained an error of  law,  such  that  the
    decision under Article 8 ECHR should be set aside and remade.

Directions

45. The appellant's appeal under Article 8 ECHR is remitted to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal at Taylor House for a de novo hearing  before  any  judge
    apart from Judge McDade.

46. The time estimate is two  hours,  and  a  Somali  interpreter  will  be
    required.

47. None of the findings of fact made by the previous Tribunal in  relation
    to the Article 8 claim will be preserved.
