Representation

The Applicant did not appear and was not represented

Mr V. Mandalia, instructed by the Solicitor, Staffordshire Country Council

                                  JUDGMENT

   1. The applicant has been granted permission to bring a  judicial  review
      against the decision of the respondent to refuse to  accept  that,  on
      arrival in the United Kingdom on 4 February 2014, he was then a child.
      Two preliminary issues arise to be considered before that question  is
      addressed.


   2. First, the appellant was, until Friday 13 March 2015,  which  was  the
      working day before the hearing,  represented  by  solicitors  who  had
      public funding to represent him in these proceedings. On 13 March 2015
      they  notified  the  Upper  Tribunal  that  public  funding  had  been
      withdrawn and that they were no longer acting for the  applicant.  The
      Litigation Friend also withdrew. The Tribunal was informed that  these
      events had been discussed with the applicant who said  that  he  would
      appear in person at the hearing so that he could  continue  to  pursue
      his challenge without legal representation.

   3. On 16 March 2015 the applicant did not appear. I was satisfied that he
      was aware of the date and time of the hearing and, as no  request  had
      been received for an adjournment and no other explanation was provided
      for his absence, I decided to proceed with the hearing in his absence.



   4. The second preliminary issue is that it appears to be clear  that  the
      application for permission was made out of time.  The  decision  under
      challenge was made on 6 February 2014. The copy of the claim  form  in
      the bundle prepared  by  the  applicant's  former  representatives  is
      unsealed and undated, as is the copy held by the respondent.  As  this
      application  was  transferred   to   the   Upper   Tribunal   by   the
      Administrative Court, the Upper  Tribunal's  records  do  not  include
      details of when the claim form was lodged. However, since  that  claim
      form was prepared by the applicant's  former  representatives  and  as
      they did not request a copy of the age assessment documents  until  23
      May 2014 it is hard to see that the  claim  form,  together  with  its
      detailed grounds, could  have  been  submitted  before  then.  In  the
      summary grounds of defence the  respondent  raises  this  concern  and
      points out that there has been no application made for an extension of
      time.

   5. Although this was not specifically dealt with  by  the  order  of  the
      judge who granted  permission,  Mr  Mandalia  agrees  that  the  Upper
      Tribunal should proceed on the basis that it is implicit in the  grant
      of permission to bring a judicial review  that  the  judge  must  have
      intended to extend time.

   6. The issue to be resolved in these proceedings is the appellant's  age,
      which is in dispute between the parties. The applicant does  not  know
      his date of birth but says that he was a child aged 16  years  old  on
      arrival in the United Kingdom on 4 February 2014 as  an  unaccompanied
      minor seeking asylum. He says he knows this from what he was  told  by
      his mother before he left the family home in Pakistan, then  aged  14,
      to travel to Iran and because he knows that he  was  two  years  older
      than his oldest sister when she died aged 14 and he is able to  deduce
      from that his age on arrival in the United Kingdom as  he  knows  also
      when his sister, together with other family members, lost their lives.
      He has asserted a date of birth of 1 January 1998, not because he  has
      any reason to believe that is, in fact, his date of birth but because,
      if he had been born in 1998, as he claims to be the case,  that  would
      place him at the youngest end of the range of ages possible.


   7. Having claimed to be a child, the applicant was placed in the care  of
      the respondent, who did not accept his asserted  age.  On  6  February
      2015 an age assessment was carried out by the two social  workers  who
      have given oral evidence in these proceedings. The outcome of that age
      assessment was a conclusion that  the  applicant  was  an  adult.  For
      reasons founded upon logical deduction  from  facts  asserted  by  the
      applicant, they decided that his most likely  date  of  birth  was  15
      October 1995, which meant that the applicant was considered then to be
      18 years and 3 months old.

   8. Thus, the applicant says that he was aged 16 years 1 month at the date
      of the age assessment on 6 February 2014 so that he is, at the date of
      the hearing before the Upper Tribunal, 17 years 2 months  old  whereas
      the respondent says that the applicant was aged 18 years 3  months  at
      the date of the age assessment which would mean  that  he  is  now  19
      years 4 months old. There is, therefore, a difference of 2 years and 2
      months between the parties in their estimate of the  applicant's  true
      age.

   9. In granting permission to bring a judicial review on 30 July 2014,  at
      which date the applicant claimed to be 16 � years  old,  Ms  Geraldine
      Clark, sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court, said this:

           "I give permission because I could not say it was  not  arguable
           that C is under 18. On the balance of  probabilities,  based  on
           the extensive evidence before me he  is  over  18.  He  did  not
           challenge the age assessment for over  3  months  after  it  was
           made... The  age  assessment  appears  to  have  been  conducted
           properly and C has no real explanation for his giving  different
           accounts of when his family died and his nationality."


      Despite granting permission, the judge refused to  grant  the  interim
      relief sought with the result that the applicant remained in detention
      until later granted bail on a  date  that  is  not  disclosed  by  the
      evidence before me.

  10. That might not appear to be a promising start to these proceedings for
      the applicant but, of course, I now have the benefit of  the  totality
      of the evidence upon which the parties seek to  rely,  including  oral
      evidence of the two social workers who carried out the age assessment.
      Although the applicant chose not to attend and was not represented,  I
      sought to raise with those witnesses the points which, based upon  the
      written evidence, I anticipated the applicant  would  have  wished  to
      raise with them.


  11. For the avoidance of any possible doubt, I embark upon the search  for
      an answer to the question now to be addressed, which is not simply the
      applicant's age but  his  most  likely  date  of  birth,  without  any
      "predisposition" that the applicant is or is not a child.


  12. Before descending into a detailed analysis  of  the  evidence,  it  is
      helpful to set out an overview of the applicant's history, as  he  has
      described it, and the evidence relied upon by the parties. As we shall
      see, the timelines that can be drawn from the applicant's evidence  of
      events are problematic in the sense that the threads of his account do
      not sit comfortably together in terms of chronology.

  13. The applicant was born in Pakistan to parents of Afghan extraction but
      he is clear that he is a citizen of  Pakistan.  Having  completed  his
      school education he moved to Iran in search of work, his  parents  and
      siblings remaining in Pakistan. He says that he was then aged  14.  He
      describes how, in February 2013, he lost contact with his parents  and
      he believes that they, and his two sisters, were killed in  a  suicide
      bombing in  another  district  of  Quetta,  to  which  area  they  had
      travelled to attend a wedding. After this, the  applicant  decided  to
      travel to the United Kingdom, funding his journey, which was  arranged
      by an agent, with the money he saved from his employment. He said that
      he left Iran either in late 2013 or early 2014 and, after a  gruelling
      8-month journey, which included  a  lengthy  period  of  detention  in
      Greece, he arrived in the United Kingdom, concealed in the back  of  a
      lorry, on 4 February 2014.

  14.  That  last  aspect  of  his  account  illustrates  the  chronological
      difficulties in the applicant's account because, plainly, an  8  month
      long journey ending with arrival in the United Kingdom on  4  February
      2014 cannot have commenced in late 2013 or early 2014. However,  since
      the applicant has confirmed that he was detained in Greece  for  about
      five months and that he spent up  to  two  months  in  Calais,  making
      repeated attempts to gain access to a lorry, it is entirely  plausible
      that at least 8 month elapsed between his departure from Iran and  his
      arrival in the United Kingdom.

  15. When encountered on arrival, he was taken  into  police  custody  and,
      after a short stay in the care of the respondent as a result of having
      claimed to be a child, he was,  following  the  age  assessment  on  6
      February 2014, transferred to immigration detention.

  16. The applicant then claimed asylum, on the basis that in the  same  way
      that his parents and sister had been killed in a suicide bomb  attack,
      if he were returned to Pakistan he too would face a real such risk.

  17. The applicant's appeal against refusal of that claim was dismissed  by
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Mayall following a hearing on 13 March 2014.
      In those proceedings,  throughout  which  the  applicant  was  legally
      represented, he was treated as an adult with a date  of  birth  of  15
      October 1995, and he raised no issue concerning his age.

  18. It is notable that in his asylum interview, the  transcript  of  which
      has been produced, the applicant's  date  of  birth  is  given  as  15
      October 1995, the date identified in the age assessment carried out by
      the respondent. Even assuming  that  to  have  been  inserted  by  the
      interviewing officer, the transcript shows that other entries  in  the
      preliminary part of the interview record that might be thought to have
      been entered in advance from information already available  have  been
      altered, presumably because the applicant pointed out that  they  were
      incorrect. Perhaps more significantly still, in his witness statement,
      prepared by his solicitors for those appeal proceedings, the applicant
      said in the opening paragraph that his date of birth  was  15  October
      1995.

  19. In his written evidence in these proceedings the applicant has offered
      no real explanation as to why he  did  not  pursue  any  challenge  in
      respect of his age or why he adopted the date of birth assigned by the
      age assessment process, without complaint, in  his  written  and  oral
      evidence to Judge Mayall. Indeed, it was only after his asylum  appeal
      had been dismissed and he had been refused  permission  to  appeal  by
      both Tribunals that his lawyers renewed the challenge  in  respect  of
      the applicant's  age.  That,  incidentally,  was  also  after  removal
      directions set for Pakistan were vacated because the  request  for  an
      emergency travel document was refused  when  the  applicant  told  the
      Officer from the Pakistani Embassy who had  interviewed  him  in  that
      regard that he was a citizen of Iran.

  20. In dismissing the appeal, Judge Mayall said that the outcome  did  not
      turn upon issues of credibility. That was because the  judge  accepted
      that, in the light of the country evidence, the appellant was at  risk
      on return to his home area in Pakistan on account of  being  a  Hazara
      Shia but no such risk existed outside Quetta and the surrounding  area
      and so it was open to the applicant to settle  elsewhere  in  Pakistan
      and it would not be unduly harsh to expect him to do so because:

           "The appellant is a young, resourceful man. He has  survived  an
           arduous journey from Pakistan and has lived, on his own account,
           in Iran for two years earning a living whilst still young. There
           is, in my judgment, nothing inherently unreasonable in expecting
           him to settle in a different part of his own country. On his own
           account he is able to get by in several languages. He does  not,
           so far as I am aware, have any health issues."

  21. Having concluded that the outcome of the appeal did not  turn  on  the
      applicant's credibility, the judge made no findings of fact in respect
      of the applicant's account of the death of his parents and sister in a
      suicide bomb attack in February 2013.

The applicant's case

  22. In support of his claim to have been 16 years old on  arrival  in  the
      United Kingdom in February 2013 the applicant relies on the following:


        a. When he started school in Pakistan he was  told  by  his  mother
           that he was in his sixth  year,  although  he  told  the  social
           workers conducting the age assessment that he was either 6 or  6
           � years old when he started  school.  He  spent  five  years  at
           primary school and two years at High School;


        b. About a month after having left school, and being unable to find
           suitable work locally, with approval from his father he moved to
           Iran to find work. He was told by his  mother  that  he  was  14
           years old when he went to Iran and the applicant says  this  was
           in 2012. That is how he knows that he must  have  been  born  in
           1998;

        c. Because he was under 18 when he moved to Iran, he was unable  to
           get a passport and so could not cross into Iran through official
           channels and instead, with the help of an agent, travelled  over
           the mountains into Iran;

        d. The applicant knows that the eldest of his two sisters,  Sakina,
           was 13 or 14 years old when she died along with his parents in a
           suicide bombing in Quetta in February 2013. The applicant  knows
           also that this sister  was  two  years  younger  than  him.  The
           applicant says that the social workers were wrong to record  him
           as having said only that his sister was 14 when she died;

        e. Although the applicant agrees that he does not know the  day  or
           month of his birth, he does know that he was 14 years  old  when
           he left for Iran in 2012 so that he must have been 16 years  old
           when he arrived in the United Kingdom in February 2014.


  23. The applicant relies upon two further pieces of evidence in  the  form
      of letters from Mr Francesco Jeff of the  Children's  Section  of  the
      Refugee Council and Ms Lauren Cape-Davenhill of the Gatwick  Detainees
      Welfare Group, both of whom have had dealings with the  applicant  and
      express the view that he is of the age he claims to be.

The respondent's case

  24. The respondent relies  upon  the  age  assessment  carried  out  on  6
      February 2014 by its two  social  workers,  David  Atherton  and  Lisa
      Nelson. As I have said, for the reasons set out in their report,  they
      concluded that the applicant was 18 years old on arrival. By a process
      of logical deduction from the evidence he had provided,  they  arrived
      at an age of 18 years and 3 months,  which  led  them  to  identify  a
      probable date of birth of 15 October 1995.


  25. I have also heard oral evidence from those two social workers.

   The legal framework.

  26. The law in this area is settled and it is sufficient  to  provide  the
      following brief  summary.  Where  the  age  assessment  of  the  local
      authority is in  dispute  it  is  for  the  court  to  reach  its  own
      assessment of age as a matter of fact. It was recognised by Lady  Hale
      in R (A) v Croydon LBC [2009] UKSC 8 that this was not a task  without
      difficulty:


           "But the question whether a person is a "child" is  a  different
           kind of question. There is a right or a wrong answer. It may  be
           difficult to determine what that answer is. The  decision-makers
           may have to do their best on the basis of less than  perfect  or
           conclusive evidence. But that is true of many questions of  fact
           which regularly come before the courts. That  does  not  prevent
           them from being questions for the courts rather than  for  other
           kinds of decision makers."


  27. In R (B) v Merton LBC [2003] EWHC 1689 (Admin), the following guidance
      was given by Stanley Burnton J as to  the  correct  approach  to  that
      task:


           "The assessment of  age  in  borderline  cases  is  a  difficult
           matter, but it is not complex. It is not an issue which requires
           anything approaching a trial, and judicialisation of the process
           is in my judgment to be avoided. It is a  matter  which  may  be
           determined informally, provided safeguards of minimum  standards
           of inquiry and of fairness are adhered to."

      Having made the point that, except in clear cases, the decision maker
      cannot determine age solely on the basis of appearance, he continued:

           I do not think it is helpful to apply concepts of onus of  proof
           to the assessment of age  by  local  authorities.  Unlike  cases
           under section 55 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
           2002, there is in the present context no  legislative  provision
           placing an onus of proof on the applicant. The  local  authority
           must make its  assessment  on  the  material  available  to  and
           obtained by it. There should be no predisposition, divorced from
           the information and evidence available to the  local  authority,
           to assume that an applicant is an adult, or conversely  that  he
           is a child..."


  28.  In  the  skeleton  argument  prepared  by  the   applicant's   former
      representatives, reliance was placed  upon  observations  made  by  Mr
      Ockelton, VP in R (AM) v Solihull MBC [2012] UKUT 00118 (IAT)


           "... So far as demeanour is concerned, it seems to us that there
           may be value to be obtained from observations of  demeanour  and
           interaction with others made over a long period of time by those
           who have opportunity to observe an individual  going  about  his
           ordinary life. But we find it difficult to see that  any  useful
           observations of demeanour or social interaction or maturity  can
           be made in the course of a short interview between an individual
           and  a  strange  adult.  There  may  of   course   be   cultural
           difficulties in such an interview but  there  are  the  ordinary
           social difficulties as well.

           The  asserted  expertise  of  a  social  worker  conducting   an
           interview is not in our judgement sufficient to counteract those
           difficulties. A person such  as  a  teacher  or  even  a  family
           member, who can point to consistent attitudes, and a  number  of
           supporting instances over a  considerable  period  of  time,  is
           likely to carry weight that observations made in the  artificial
           surroundings of an interview cannot carry.

           Reactions from the individual's peers are also likely to  be  of
           assistance if they are available. We do not suggest  that  other
           young people are qualified specifically to give  evidence  about
           the age of a colleague of theirs, nor should they be  encouraged
           to do so. But those who work with groups of young people see how
           they react with one another and  it  seems  to  us  likely  that
           evidence of such interaction, if available, may well  assist  in
           making  an  age  assessment,  particularly  if   any   necessary
           allowance for cultural differences can be made."

      The point being made on the applicant's behalf  appears  to  be  that,
      unlike the respondent's social workers,  who  had  only  a  relatively
      brief opportunity to engage with the applicant, the two  persons  from
      whom he obtained letters of support, were able to observe him  over  a
      longer period.


   Analysis of the evidence


  29. The chronological difficulties with the applicant's account of  events
      are plainly apparent. He relies both upon what he says he was told  by
      his mother and by establishing his age by reference to events that  he
      feels able to identify in terms of how long ago they happened. He says
      he left Pakistan and travelled to Iran about one month after finishing
      school and that he was told by his mother, just before he  left,  that
      he was then 14. But he says also that his  mother  told  him  that  he
      started school "in my sixth year" which presumably means when he was 5
      years old, although he told the social workers he was either 6 or 6  �
      years old when he started school. As he is clear that he spent 7 years
      at school, he would have been 12 years old if he had started aged 5 or
      13 years old if he had started aged 6.


  30.  It is convenient to begin with an examination of the  age  assessment
      report and to consider the challenges to that report  that  have  been
      raised.


  31. As we shall see, the reasoning of the social workers that led them  to
      conclude that the applicant was, at the time  of  that  assessment  in
      February 2014,  18  years  and  3  months  old,  is  founded  upon  an
      acceptance of the information he himself had provided.  The  steps  in
      that reasoning process were:

        a. There was no documentary evidence as to the applicant's  age  or
           date  of  birth.  The  social  workers   considered   that   his
           "interaction" during the interview indicated a level of maturity
           exceeding his asserted age;


        b. The applicant explained that the elder of his two sisters was 14
           years old at the time of her death in the suicide bomb attack in
           Quetta and that had occurred "about two to two and a half  years
           ago";

        c. It was 13 months after discovering that his parents and siblings
           had been killed in the bomb attack that he left Iran in order to
           travel to the United Kingdom.

      This led to the following conclusion:

           "Mustafa states that his sister died at the age of fourteen  and
           this incident occurred two to two and a half years ago.  Mustafa
           confirmed on several occasions that there  was  a  two-year  gap
           between him and his sister with him being two years  older  than
           her. Therefore if his sister died at the age of 14  as  asserted
           by Mustafa then he must have been sixteen at  the  time  of  her
           death. If the death occurred two to two and  a  half  years  ago
           this  would  make  Mustafa  over  eighteen.  Mustafa's  physical
           presentation also indicated that he could  be  even  older  than
           currently assessed."

      This was reinforced by what was written in the previous section of the
      report, which is headed "Adverse Provisional View":

           "The reason for coming to the conclusion that Mustafa is over 18
           is  that  he  was  given  several  opportunities  to  alter  the
           discrepancy of his age  raised  by  his  assertion  of  the  age
           difference between him and the  age  of  his  sisters.  On  each
           occasion he confirmed the age difference  and  the  age  of  his
           sisters at their death. When it was put to him that  this  could
           only mean that he was over 18 he at first stated that he may  be
           older but not 18 and then to say that it was possible  that  his
           mum had made a mistake."

  32. The applicant raises two  challenges  to  that  reasoning.  First,  he
      insists that he did not say that the elder of his two sisters  was  14
      at the time of her death, but that he said she was  either  13  or  14
      years old. Secondly, he says that had he been asked not how  long  ago
      his family had been killed but when they had been killed he would have
      said that this happened in February 2013 and so the calculation of age
      flowing from the date of that event would  have  been  different  and,
      even applying the same reasoning process,  the  social  workers  would
      have found him to be one year younger than they did.

  33. Dealing with the first of the two challenges raised by the  applicant,
      it can be seen that this has been dealt with in robust terms  by  both
      social workers. Mr Atherton said in his witness statement:

           "The claimant  told  us  that  his  family  were  killed  in  an
           explosion. When first asked how long ago his family were  killed
           in an explosion he said it was two  years.  When  he  was  asked
           again he said it was less than  two  years  ago.  When  asked  a
           further time he said that the explosion in which his family died
           occurred two to two and a half years before the age  assessment.
           When it was pointed out to  him  that  he  had  given  different
           answers to  the  same  question  the  claimant  settled  on  the
           explosion  occurring  two  years  before  the   age   assessment
           interview. The claimant told us that his sister Sakina,  was  14
           years of age at the time of her death, that  he  was  two  years
           older than her, and that Sakina died two  years  before,  in  an
           explosion. We asked the claimant to confirm that each  of  those
           three pieces of information was correct at  least  five  or  six
           times. Each time he was asked he confirmed that it  was  correct
           that his sister, Sakina, was 14 when she died, that he  was  two
           years older than her and that she died two years before the date
           of the age assessment interview."

      And in her witness statement Ms Nelson said this:

           "At first the claimant gave differing accounts as  to  how  long
           before the age assessment his family were killed.  The  claimant
           first claimed they were killed two years ago, then less than two
           years ago and then 2 to 2 � years ago.  I  pointed  out  to  the
           claimant that he had given three different answers  to  the  one
           question asking how long ago his family had died. He  then  told
           me  that  the  explosion  occurred  two  years  before  the  age
           assessment interview. He settled on the explosion occurring  two
           years before the age assessment. The claimant told us  that  his
           older  sister,  Sakina,  was  14   when   she   died   (in   the
           aforementioned explosion) and that he was two years  older  than
           his sister. I asked the claimant to  confirm  that  his  sister,
           Sakina, was 14 when she died, that her death occurred two  years
           before the age assessment and that he was two years  older  than
           her. The claimant confirms that each of those  three  pieces  of
           information was correct on a number of occasions."


  34. Both witnesses addressed the assertion by the applicant that they  had
      misreported his evidence and that he had said not that his sister  had
      been 14 at the date of her death but 13 or 14, but  both  reject  that
      assertion in clear and unambiguous terms, pointing also  to  the  fact
      that a contemporaneous note of the interview made no  mention  of  any
      reference to the possibility of the applicant's sister being 13  years
      old at the date of her death. In her statement Ms Nelson observed:


           "There was never a mention of 13 to 14 years of age."

  35. Both Mr Atherton and Ms Nelson  have  also  confirmed  in  their  oral
      evidence that, so far as they are concerned, there is no room here for
      ambiguity or doubt. The applicant said only that  his  sister  was  14
      when she died. Mr Atherton explained that it quickly  became  apparent
      that if the timeline being set out by the applicant in  the  interview
      was true then he could not have been under 18 years of age on  arrival
      in the United Kingdom. Therefore, they went over this again and  again
      to make sure that the applicant was clear about the difficulties  that
      were arising in his account of his age. They pointed out that  if  his
      sister had lost her life two to two and a half years ago and  she  was
      then 14, that could only mean that the  applicant  himself  must  then
      have been 16 years old and as he said that he had remained in Iran for
      13 months after that, before embarking on an 8 month long  journey  to
      the United Kingdom, his claim to have been a child on  arrival  cannot
      be correct.


  36. Both Mr Atherton and Ms Nelson said in oral evidence  that  they  were
      concerned that the applicant had given different accounts  during  the
      interview of when various events had  occurred  and  were  anxious  to
      ensure not just that he understood the significance  of  what  he  was
      saying and the logical outcome in terms of his age, but also  that  he
      had ample opportunity to correct any errors. All of this is  confirmed
      also by the contemporaneous handwritten notes made of the interview.

  37. I have no doubt at all that the social workers did all they  could  to
      provide the applicant with every possible opportunity to set  out  the
      account upon which he wished to rely and that the account  upon  which
      the applicant settled as to when various events had occurred  was  the
      one that he regarded as correct. This was not a case of an interviewer
      seizing  upon  an  ill-considered  remark  in  order  to  justify  any
      particular  conclusion.  On  the  contrary,  the   tensions   in   the
      applicant's account were repeatedly pointed out and their consequences
      explained after which the applicant was allowed  to  say  whatever  he
      wished, after thought and reflection.


  38. Ms Nelson observed also that at no point did  the  applicant  offer  a
      date for the bomb attack. If that had been known to him then there was
      ample opportunity for him to have confirmed it and it would have  been
      reasonable to expect him to do so, in response to these questions. The
      fact that he was asked how long ago an event occurred did not preclude
      a response in the form of a date rather than a period of time that had
      since elapsed.

  39. The applicant's former representatives have  included  in  the  bundle
      some news reports of a bomb attack in Quetta on 16  February  2013  in
      which something in the region of 63 people were killed  and  180  were
      injured. However, the evidence before Judge  Mayall  illustrated  that
      there have been  many  other  bomb  attacks  in  Quetta  before  that,
      including in 2012 which would have been about two years before the age
      assessment interview. That was the basis upon which the judge  reached
      his conclusion that there was a real risk of the applicant  coming  to
      harm should he return to Quetta.

  40. There is, therefore, a conflict of evidence  to  be  resolved.  Having
      heard oral evidence and having looked carefully at all that  has  been
      offered in written evidence I have no doubt at all that the account of
      Mr Atherton and Ms Nelson of  what  the  applicant  said  at  the  age
      assessment interview is correct. Given the terms in  which  they  have
      given evidence about this there is no room for error. Either they  are
      telling the truth about this or they are not. They have no  reason  at
      all to give dishonest evidence which they know  to  be  incorrect  and
      their recollection is supported by a contemporaneous handwritten  note
      as well as by the typed record of  the  information  provided  by  the
      applicant contained in the age assessment  report  that  was  prepared
      shortly afterwards.

  41. The applicant's case is founded upon the bomb  attack  being  the  one
      that occurred on 16 February 2013. The fact  that  the  date  of  that
      suicide bomb attack is 16 February 2013 generates significant problems
      of chronology for the applicant.  If  his  parents  and  sisters  were
      indeed killed in that attack then his account of remaining in Iran for
      a further 13 months saving up the money to  fund  his  agent  assisted
      journey to the United Kingdom, a  journey  that  took  some  8  months
      including a period of detention in  Greece  (the  applicant  told  the
      social workers that he was detained in Greece for five months),  which
      would mean a period of 21 months between the date of the  bomb  attack
      and his arrival in the United Kingdom, cannot be correct as he arrived
      in the United Kingdom on 4 February 2014 which was just less  than  12
      months after the date of the bomb attack, if that occurred in February
      2013.

  42. This gives rise to two possibilities. Either the  applicant's  account
      of these events and the chronological happening of them is  hopelessly
      inaccurate simply because he is unable reliably to provide an accurate
      timeline of events that did in fact occur, but more  quickly  than  he
      had thought, or his account is untrue.

  43. For the following reasons, I am satisfied that the applicant  has  not
      given a truthful account of his family being killed in the bomb attack
      on 16 February 2013.

  44. First, if it were true that the applicant  was  aware  of  the  attack
      because his family were all killed in the explosion, and that,  as  he
      claims, he could have given the actual date upon which it occurred had
      he been asked, then it is impossible to understand why he did  not  do
      so during the age assessment interview.  It  is  plain  from  what  is
      written that he was made aware that the event was being  discussed  in
      conjunction with his sister's known age in order to establish his  own
      age, which he knew was in dispute. It is clear that he was not anxious
      or under pressure at the time. It is also beyond doubt that  this  was
      something that was  examined  repeatedly  and  with  care  during  the
      interview, so as to ensure that there was  no  error  in  establishing
      just what it was that the applicant wished to say. The  only  sensible
      explanation for him not providing the date is that he did not know it.



  45. Further, his account of arriving at the conclusion that his family had
      been killed in the attack in February 2013 is  completely  lacking  in
      credibility. As I have observed, 63 people were killed in this  attack
      but, perhaps as might be expected, a much larger number, according  to
      one of the news reports more than 200, were injured. Therefore, if the
      applicant's family had been present in the vicinity of  the  explosion
      there was much more of a chance that they would have been injured than
      killed. The news report records that this bombing was carried out in a
      market. One report refers to it as a vegetable market.  The  applicant
      said that his family had gone to this location, which was a 20  minute
      journey from the family  home,  to  attend  a  wedding.  There  is  no
      indication in the news reports that there were casualties among people
      attending a wedding. The applicant offered no explanation at  all  why
      he assumed that all four of his family members must have been  killed,
      rather than injured, and nor why he made no enquiries to see  if  they
      had received medical attention at local hospitals or at the  hospitals
      in Karachi where, according to the  news  reports,  the  injured  were
      taken.

  46. It might be  noted  also  that  in  a  news  report  provided  by  the
      applicant's former representatives we see this:

           "The Balochistan governor, under whose charge the  province  had
           been placed last month, announced Rs1 million as compensation to
           the heirs of each of the victims. He said that  those  who  were
           critically injured  would  be  shifted  to  Karachi  for  better
           treatment."

      There appears to be no reason to assume that  the  applicant's  former
      representatives  would  not  have  discussed  with  him  the  evidence
      submitted on  his  behalf  and  no  explanation  is  offered  why  the
      applicant, who is presumably the only surviving heir of four relatives
      he said were killed in the explosion, did not pursue this either.

  47. There is other evidence  which  does  not  sit  comfortably  with  the
      applicant's account of the death of his family. As  this  evidence  is
      untested, and the specific source of the information is  unidentified,
      it carries no weight in itself but at least it can be seen not  to  be
      inconsistent with my finding of fact that the applicant's  account  of
      the death of his family is untrue. At  paragraph  14  of  his  witness
      statement,  Mr  Guest,  manager  of  the  children's  home  where  the
      applicant was accommodated at the time of  the  age  assessment,  said
      this:


           "Also at point on 5 February 2014 I understand that the Claimant
           told a staff member that he lived in France with his friend  for
           4 weeks and also  that  his  family  remained  in  Pakistan  and
           Afghanistan."


  48. I am further reinforced in my conclusion by other matters disclosed by
      the applicant's account. In the age assessment interview he said  that
      he had been detained  in  Greece  for  5  months.  Thus,  although  he
      described continuing to work in Iran for 13 months or so after hearing
      in February 2013 of the death of his family, in  order  to  raise  the
      money for his journey to the United Kingdom, that  cannot  be  correct
      either because there was only 12 months or so between the date of  the
      bomb attack and his arrival in the United Kingdom and, if 5  of  those
      months were spent on Greece, that would leave just 7  months  for  the
      period of work in Iran to raise the money and for the rest of what  he
      described as an 8 month long journey.



  49. There is, of course, other evidence to consider. On the one hand,  the
      applicant relies upon the views  offered  by  Mr  Jeff  and  Ms  Cape-
      Davenhill  and  on  the  other,  the  respondent   relies   upon   the
      professional evaluation of Mr Atherton and Ms Nelson based upon  their
      own observation of the applicant.

  50. Mr Francesco Jeff is employed by the Refugee Council in the Children's
      Section and describes himself as a Children's Advisor for Age  Dispute
      cases. He has been working with  children  for  12  years  and  before
      moving to the United Kingdom from Italy  was  employed  as  a  primary
      school teacher. He has also worked with children in Sudan and Iraq. He
      has provided a letter dated 22 June 2014, addressed to the applicant's
      former representatives, in which he says this:

           "I have Visit (sic) Mustafa on 16/06/2014 at the  centre  and  I
           spend about an hour with him. As an experienced staff member  of
           the Children's Section I strongly believed that Mustafa  is  the
           age he claimed to be on arrival. My views are based on our daily
           interactions and observations of him made  in  various  contexts
           (one-to-one advice sessions, social gathering, group work, etc).


           Mustafa may look older physically than a 16  year  old  to  some
           people, however, when you spend some time with him, you  realise
           that Mustafa's behaviour strongly indicates that he is 16  years
           old. If you pays (sic) closer attention it becomes clear some of
           his traits (such  as  his  newly  grown  facial  hair)  strongly
           indicate that he is not an adult. Above all, Mustafa's demeanour
           and behaviour, which I address above, are consistent with one of
           a 16-year old person.  Mustafa  has  learned  to  speak  English
           really well since he has been in the  UK.  A  child  of  16  and
           younger tends to learn languages faster than someone who  is  18
           years old or older. Since 16/05/14 I spoke to  him  on  a  daily
           basis and some time several times daily  on  the  telephone  and
           these interactions have confirmed my view that he is a child.
           ...
           I am extremely concerned  that  this  vulnerable  young  man  is
           detained with adults."


  51. I do not find Mr Jeff's evidence of much assistance at all. He has not
      attended to give oral evidence and so has not made  himself  available
      for cross examination on behalf of the respondent.  That,  of  course,
      does not in itself negate any value  that  might  be  drawn  from  his
      letter but it is  not  altogether  easy  to  see  precisely  what  his
      evidence is. He speaks of a single, hour long visit and many telephone
      conversations, but also of group work and one to one advice  sessions.
      He speaks of having "addressed above" in his  letter  the  applicant's
      demeanour and behaviour but in fact his brief letter is silent  as  to
      those issues. It seems he  bases  his  view  on  matters  of  physical
      appearance, which he accepts may suggest to others that the  applicant
      is older than he claims to  be;  an  assessment  of  facial  hair  and
      impressions from interaction, which may have  been  to  a  significant
      extent by telephone. Also, his views are to be contrasted  with  those
      of the staff at the centre where the applicant was staying at the time
      of the age assessment who told Mr Atherton and Ms Nelson that:


           "... there was a general belief that he  is  older  than  he  is
           saying and that his physical presentations suggests that he is a
           lot older than the other young people in the placement."


  52. Further, Mr Jeff's description of the applicant as "a vulnerable young
      man" goes entirely  unexplained,  as  does  Mr  Jeff's  expression  of
      concern arising from that asserted vulnerability.


  53. For all of those reasons I am unable to attach any real weight to  the
      view expressed by Mr Jeff.

  54. The applicant relies also upon a letter from Ms Lauren  Cape-Davenhill
      of Gatwick Detainees Welfare Group, dated 30 June 2014. She  describes
      herself  as  a  Detainee  Advocacy  Co-ordinator  of  that  charitable
      organisation in which capacity her role  is  "to  provide  advice  and
      support, including emotional support, to  individuals  in  immigration
      detention". She says that she has dealt with "approximately 4 or 5 age
      disputed individuals" and that "almost all of those individuals I have
      been involved in referring as  age  disputed  have  subsequently  been
      released from detention and found to be minors".

  55. I do not find that assertion compelling at  all.  With  such  a  small
      number of case examples the vagueness with which the numbers of  cases
      she has dealt with and the outcomes of them are reported is,  I  find,
      telling. The use of the expression "approximately 4  or  5"  does  not
      inspire confidence in the accuracy of her recollection  and,  frankly,
      to say that "almost all" have found to be minors is not persuasive  in
      terms of accuracy either since it would  be  reasonable  to  expect  a
      clearer recollection of the outcome of such a small  sample,  even  if
      records or case notes were no longer available to check.

  56. In any event, the view expressed by Ms Cape-Davenhill is founded  upon
      such limited contact with the applicant that I am unable to afford any
      real weight to her views. She spoke of a single visit since  when  her
      contact with the applicant has been by telephone. She says that  after
      speaking with the applicant's former representatives she arranged  for
      a volunteer to visit the applicant on a weekly basis  but  nothing  at
      all is offered by that  person,  or  those  persons,  about  what  was
      discerned as a result.

  57.  Further,  Ms  Cape-Davenhill's  assessment,  set  out  in  her  final
      paragraph, directly contradicts the view of Mr Jeff, who accepted that
      the applicant's physical appearance  suggests  he  is  older  than  he
      claimed to be. Conversely, Ms Cape-Davenhill said:

           "I believe that Mustafa Rustami is likely to be under  18  years
           old. When I met him in person on  6th  June  2014,  he  appeared
           physically young: he is of slight build and  has  little  facial
           hair, and looked to me like a teenager (under 18) rather than an
           adult..."


      Ms Cape-Davenhill went on to say that:


           "... his behaviour also suggested that he is likely to be  under
           18 years old - he came across as quite young and na�ve about his
           situation."


      But she offered nothing to explain what it  was  about  his  behaviour
      that informed that view.

  58. There is evidence also, in the form of a witness  statement,  from  Mr
      Mark Guest, who is the manager of the children's  home  at  which  the
      applicant was staying at the time of the age assessment. He said this:


           "The views of  the  staff  were  that  he  had  presented  as  a
           confident young man and  seemed  older  in  his  appearance  and
           attitude than the  Unaccompanied  Asylum  Seeking  Children  who
           staff had previously worked with. The staff considered that  the
           Claimant was aged between 20 and 22 years of age but  could  not
           be sure. The consensus was that he was older than 18 years old."


      Mr Guest added that he communicated this information  to  Mr  Atherton
      after he had completed the age assessment, explaining:


           "I decided to speak with David Atherton about the views  of  the
           staff  as  I  was  concerned  because  the  Children's  Home  is
           registered to look after people who are under 18 only."


  59. For the same reasons I gave already given, this evidence is of limited
      value in terms of the weight that can be given to it.  The  expression
      of collective views of  the  staff  is  impossible  to  test  in  oral
      evidence and nothing is  known  about  the  experience  of  the  staff
      members concerned or why their views are  or  are  not  likely  to  be
      accurate. Nothing is known about the level of contact  or  interaction
      that generated those views. All that can be said is that  the  manager
      of the home was sufficiently persuaded by his view  of  the  applicant
      and those of his staff to be motivated to speak to Mr  Atherton  about
      his concern that someone as old as he  thought  the  applicant  to  be
      should be placed with the children under his care.


  60. All that remains is whatever can be  drawn  from  the  age  assessment
      report and the written and oral evidence of Mr Atherton and Ms Nelson.


  61. The age  assessment  report  is  in  familiar  form  under  the  usual
      headings. As for the applicant's demeanour:

           "During the interview Mustafa appeared relaxed and  not  at  all
           nervous. He was happy to answer questions and did not  seem  ill
           at ease in the presence  of  adults.  Staff  at  the  children's
           home... reported he was eating well and had cooked himself  some
           food  effectively.  Mustafa  did  not  express  or  display  any
           distress when talking about his family."

  62. Drawing all of this together, I reach the following conclusions.


  63. I recognise that I cannot weave together  into  a  single  thread  the
      various strands of the applicant's account of the matters  upon  which
      he relies to establish his age. For example,  one  cannot  say  simply
      that because his mother told him he was 14 when  he  left  school  and
      moved to Iran, as he says he spent a total of 2  years  and  3  months
      working in Iran and 8 months on his journey  to  the  United  Kingdom,
      therefore he must have been 16 years and 11 months old on arrival  (14
      + 2 years 3 months + 8 months). That is because first we do  not  know
      whether he had only recently passed his 14th birthday  or  whether  he
      was approaching his 15th birthday, on his mother's  account,  when  he
      left Pakistan and secondly, for the  reasons  I  have  already  given,
      there is good reason to doubt the reliability of the  account  of  his
      mother having accurately informed him of his age at the time.

  64. I have found as a fact that the applicant's account of  the  death  of
      his family is untrue. But that does not means that what he says  about
      that is of no assistance. On the contrary, I am  satisfied  that  this
      provides the most reliable means of establishing the applicant's  true
      age. The age assessment interview  was  a  carefully  and  sensitively
      operated process which provided the applicant with the  best  possible
      forum for disclosing information  about  himself  and  his  family  to
      inform the age assessment process.

  65. There is no reason at all to doubt that  the  applicant  was  2  years
      older than his sister, Sakina. Indeed, that is  further  confirmed  by
      the applicant's  description  of  their  respective  journeys  through
      school years. There is no reason either to doubt  that  the  applicant
      knew how old she was at any particular time.  Although I have no doubt
      that his account of his sister's death about 2 years or so before  the
      date of the age assessment interview was untrue, that  does  not  mean
      that his assessment that, at that time, she would have been  14  years
      old so that he at that time would have been 16 years old should not be
      accepted. Therefore, on the applicant's own account, in February  2012
      he was 16 years old. That means, as a  matter  of  simple  arithmetic,
      that he would have been 18 years old on arrival in the United  Kingdom
      on 4 February 2014.

  66. The arithmetic, unfortunately, is not quite as  simple  as  that.  The
      applicant, as I have observed, does not know the day or month  of  his
      birth and so there remains open a 12 month range of  ages  within  the
      conclusion that he was 18 years old on arrival. Explaining the reasons
      why he and Ms Nelson arrived at an age of 18 years and  3  months,  Mr
      Atherton said in his witness statement:

           "If the Claimant was aged 16 at the time of his  sister's  death
           then he must have been 18 years plus X at the time  of  the  age
           assessment. As detailed above the  Claimant  told  us  that  his
           sisters died 2 - 2 � years ago. If it had been the case that his
           sisters had died 2 � years before the age assessment  then  that
           would make the Claimant's age closer to 19  years.  Lisa  and  I
           agreed to err on the side of caution as regards an assessed date
           of birth and therefore calculated that 18 years and 3 months was
           the youngest that  the  Claimant  could  have  been.  It  seemed
           appropriate to put his date of birth in the middle of the  month
           hence him having an assessed date of birth of 15 October 1995."


  67.  I agree with that approach and adopt it. There is a clear  and  sound
      evidential basis for concluding that the applicant was 16 � years  old
      in February 2012 so that he was over 18 years of age on arrival in the
      United Kingdom on 4 February 2014. The date of birth identified by the
      age assessment process  of  15  October  1995  reflects  not  just  an
      arithmetical calculation but also was informed by the observations and
      conclusions of two  experienced  social  workers  who  carried  out  a
      careful, fair and "Merton compliant" age assessment. That resulted  in
      a date of birth that was adopted by the  applicant  without  complaint
      for the purpose of his asylum appeal. That conclusion chimes also with
      the views said to have been expressed by the staff at  the  children's
      centre that the applicant appeared to be older that  the  other  young
      people accommodated there.

  68. For all these reasons, I find that at the date of the  age  assessment
      on 6 February 2014 the applicant was an adult aged over  18  years  of
      age, his most likely date of birth being 15 October 1995.

Conclusion

  69. I find that the applicant's most likely date of birth  is  15  October
      1995.
