                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of Euphemia Ada Anita Nwakibu, a citizen of  Nigeria
    born 20 December 1982, and her  son  [EE]  born  [  -  ],  against  the
    decisions of  22  September  2014  to  refuse  their  applications  for
    residence cards confirming their right of residence. That appeal having
    been dismissed on 26 August 2015, the  Appellant  now  appeals  to  the
    Upper Tribunal with permission.

 2. The application of 2 June 2014 that gives rise to these proceedings was
    for permanent residence cards for her and her son [EE] born [  -  ]  in
    the light of her having retained a right  of  residence  following  her
    divorce from Sherwn Biangelo Isaac Girigorie on 24 February 2014.  They
    had previously been issued residence cards on 26  September  valid  for
    five years.

 3. The application was refused because, whilst the  fact  of  divorce  and
    custody of a relevant child were accepted, as was the  Appellant's  own
    economic activity,  so  establishing  that  the  gateway  criteria  for
    consideration under the retained residence route were established,  the
    Secretary of State did not accept that her former husband was shown  to
    have been exercising Treaty rights at the time of the divorce: although
    evidence had been supplied of him working at various  times  from  2009
    until September 2014, it did not tally with "internal records" held  by
    the Home Office which did not record any such activity for him. A  HMRC
    document  of  27  August  2014  produced  in  response  to  an   inter-
    departmental enquiry under section  40  of  the  UK  Borders  Act  2007
    recorded that there were no self-assessment or PAYE records held for Mr
    Girigorie.

 4. Evidence relied upon included a letter from Cyber Caf�  identifying  Mr
    Girigorie as an employee  who  had  been  earning  �625  monthly  as  a
    computer/office assistant since  5  June  2013;  HMRC  records  for  14
    January 2013 and 30 March 2013 stating that he owed �68.90 of  national
    insurance class 2 payments; a late payment  notice  of  31  March  2012
    stamped by Thamesmead Post Office as paid  on 28 May 2012;  and  a  pay
    slip from Concepts College on 31 October 2009  recording  that  he  had
    paid tax of �72.08 and national insurance of �46.57 on earnings of �900
    so far in the relevant tax year.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal noted that Mr Girigorie's name was  an  unusual
    one that would reduce the chance of some mistake when his records  were
    investigated by HMRC. As to the evidence put forward purporting to show
    his exercise of Treaty rights, the material from  Cyber  Caf�  did  not
    give a leaving date for the work it said commenced 5 June  2013;  there
    was no evidence as to the nature of  the  self-employment  said  to  be
    evidenced by national insurance  contribution  records;  there  was  no
    evidence that she had sought to  contact  her  husband,  who  she  said
    wanted nothing further to do with her. The Tribunal concluded that even
    if he was working (as might be the  case  if  Cyber  Caf�  or  Concepts
    College did not report his earnings, recorded as cash,  to  HMRC),  his
    earnings of �7,500 gross did not suggest any real link between him  and
    the domestic labour market. Given the categorical response of  HMRC  to
    the enquiry as to his economic activity she  had  failed  to  establish
    that her ex-husband had ever been a qualified person.

 6. There was no evidence before it of connections with the United  Kingdom
    other than the child's attendance at school and whilst [EE]  had  spent
    more than seven years here, there was nothing  to  suggest  that  their
    removal would be disproportionate, even acknowledging that his evidence
    might  be  viewed  to  have  been  on  the  more  stable  end  of   the
    precariousness scale.

 7. Grounds of appeal challenged the decision on the basis that
    (a)    The human rights ruling was contrary to the principles regarding
         the best interests of children established by the case law (it  was
         correctly acknowledged before me that this ground fell away in  the
         light of Amirteymour & Ors (EEA appeals; human rights) [2015]  UKUT
         466 (IAC) finding that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to consider
         human rights issues within the ambit of an  appeal  under  the  EEA
         Regulations);
    (b)    The Tribunal had overlooked the fact that the  address  searched
         against by HMRC was 209 [ - ] Road [ - ], not a residence where her
         ex-husband had ever lived;
    (c)    The national insurance contribution records showed it  was  more
         likely than not that the husband had worked;
    (d)    The findings regarding Cyber Caf� were not well reasoned;
    (e)    The Tribunal failed to take account of the fact that  the  level
         of pay of the ex-husband did not reach the level at which he  would
         have paid tax;
    (f)    The Tribunal  wrongly  focussed  on  the  entirety  of  the  ex-
         husband's residence rather than on circumstances  at  the  date  of
         divorce.

 8. Judge Plimmer granted permission to appeal on 13 January  2016  on  the
    basis that the Tribunal had not adequately considered  the  possibility
    that Mr Girigorie would not have paid tax given his  income  level  and
    thus would not have appeared on HMRC records.

 9. Before me Mr Waheed expanded on the grounds of appeal, emphasising that
    the  Tribunal  could  take  judicial  notice  of  the  fact  that   the
    Appellant's ex-husband did not  earn  enough  to  attract  any  tax  or
    national insurance liability. Mr Kotas submitted that the  findings  of
    the First-tier Tribunal were perfectly rational and could not be  shown
    to be unreasonable.

Findings and reasons

10. I do not consider that the  approach  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    legally sustainable.

11. There are two concerns with the section 40 request: firstly  the  third
    of the Appellant's names  was  correctly  given  by  the  Secretary  of
    State's officer making the enquiry as Isaac; however the response  gave
    it as  Isaal.  Secondly  the  address  against  which  the  search  was
    requested was 6 [ - ], Thamesmead, London [ - ].  The  response  of  27
    August 2014 was made with respect to  the  address  209  [  -  ]  Road,
    Cartford, [ - ]. Patently a search  conducted  via  a  computer,  whose
    world is a notoriously binary one where either there is a  precise  hit
    or there  is  not,  would  not  necessarily  retrieve  the  appropriate
    information for Mr Girigorie if the wrong data was input in  the  first
    place.

12. One might have thought that a data search of this kind would  routinely
    search for potential positive returns that included  likely  variations
    of the name sought: but nothing to that effect is asserted  within  the
    section 40 return. But then again one might equally well have  imagined
    that HMRC would manage, in a document that only included  a  few  words
    that were bespoke to the enquiry in hand, to correctly spell  the  well
    known London suburb "Catford".

13. It is clear that the First-tier Tribunal's approach to  the  assessment
    of the evidence overall attributed significant weight to the section 40
    return. However I do not consider that the document necessarily  should
    have received  such  weight  without  having  regard  to  the  material
    considerations identified above.

14. The other considerations identified by the grounds of appeal will  fall
    to be assessed as part of the general assessment of the case on  a  re-
    hearing. The argument that the Appellant did not earn at a  level  that
    would attract tax or national insurance liability is  not  a  clear-cut
    one, whatever the relevant thresholds might be, given the fact that the
    documents relied on by the Appellant do in fact record  him  as  making
    such contributions.

15. Furthermore, the  statement  that  even  if  earnings  of  �7,500  were
    established as  genuine,  nevertheless  no  genuine  economic  activity
    relevant to the exercise of Treaty Rights was shown,  failed  to  apply
    the relevant test, which is whether the work in question is genuine and
    effective in the sense set out in authorities  such  as  Lawrie-Blum  v
    Land Baden-W�rttemberg Case 66/85, [1986] ECR 2121.  As  summarised  in
    the later case of D.M. Levin v  Staatssecretaris  van  Justitie  [1982]
    EUECJ R-53/81 at [17]: "the rules on freedom of  movement  for  workers
    ... cover only the pursuit of effective and genuine activities, to  the
    exclusion of activities on such a small scale  as  to  be  regarded  as
    purely marginal and ancillary".

16. It is accordingly necessary for the appeal to be  reheard.  The  First-
    tier Tribunal will wish to follow the guidance in HS  (EEA:  revocation
    and retained rights) Syria [2011] UKUT 00165 (IAC) which clarifies that
    Regulation 10  of  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006  requires  the
    applicant to demonstrate that the EEA national  spouse  was  exercising
    treaty rights at the time he ceased to be a family member.

    Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of
    law.  As there are no lawful relevant findings upon which to build, the
    matter is  suitable  for  re-hearing  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    accordingly remit the appeal to that forum.
