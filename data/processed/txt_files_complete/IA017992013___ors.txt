               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:      Mr G Pall, of J R Rahman, Solicitors
For the Respondent:     Mr A Mullen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1) The appellants are husband,  wife  and  two  children,  all  citizens  of
   Ghana. On 2 January 2013 the respondent refused  their  applications  for
   leave to remain  as  a  PBS  (Points  Based  System)  Migrant  and  three
   dependants.  They appeal against a determination by  First-tier  Tribunal
   Quigley, promulgated on 27 June 2013, dismissing  their  appeals  against
   those decisions.

2) In the First-tier Tribunal, the appellants conceded that they  could  not
   meet the requirements under the Rules relating to the PBS nor  the  Rules
   relating to their private and family life in the UK in respect of Article
   8.  Their cases were argued only on Article 8 grounds, outwith the Rules.



3) These are the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal:

    ... The judge appears to have concluded that ... the [first]  appellant
    could [not] maintain himself in the UK without recourse to public funds
    because his accounts were regularly overdrawn ... The judge  erred  ...
    as the fact that the appellant was regularly overdrawn would  not  have
    precluded him from being a burden  to  the  public  purse  [sic].   Her
    misconstruction ... amounts to an error in law.


    ... The judge at paragraph 33 ... misdirected  herself  [in]  assessing
    the Article 8 case.  The judge failed to  set  out  what  circumstances
    were considered in finding that the refusal did not amount to a  breach
    of Article 8 ... there was no detailed  consideration  ...  as  to  the
    circumstances of the sponsor's [sic; presumably this should  be  "first
    appellant's"] family life or any balancing exercise ...  to  provide  a
    sound basis for the findings ... made.


    ...  The  judge  despite  being  directed  ...   in   the   appellant's
    representative's submissions ... paid no regard to the  best  interests
    of the [first] appellant's children and fails to justify  her  lack  of
    favourable discretion at paragraph 34 which  is  essential  given  that
    [the first appellant's] son was only  6  months  off  ...  the  7  year
    qualifying mark in accordance with paragraph EX1.


4) Permission was granted  on  the  view  that  the  judge  might  not  have
   differentiated clearly between the consideration under the  Rules  and  a
   "freestanding proportionality assessment", which had  arguably  not  been
   conducted "within the correct legal framework".

5) Mr Pall firstly directed attention to paragraph 30 of the  determination.
    The judge noted that the first appellant was overdrawn by �478.16 on  10
   May 2013 and the second  appellant  by  �1,126.06  on  3  May  2013,  and
   concluded that the evidence did  not  support  the  submission  that  the
   appellants could maintain themselves without recourse  to  public  funds.
   Mr Paul said that was illogical.  He also sought to  criticise  paragraph
   33 of the determination, where the judge finds that interference with the
   private life of the appellants would  be  proportionate,  and  would  not
   entail any breach of Article 8.  He relied  on  the  observation  in  the
   grant of permission for the submission that this  failed  to  distinguish
   the case within the Rules from the case outwith the Rules.  It  was  only
   necessary for the appellants to show a "good arguable case" in  order  to
   justify consideration outwith the Rules.  The judge had failed to set out
   what she made of  the  best  interests  of  the  children  as  a  primary
   consideration.  Her determination should be set aside  and  the  decision
   reversed.

6) Mr Mullen acknowledged that the overdrafts were not very large,  and  did
   not justify the conclusion that the  appellants  would  not  be  able  to
   maintain themselves without recourse to public funds.  He said  that  was
   incidental to the outcome.  As to Article 8, the judge set  out  all  the
   relevant factors, even if in fairly short form,  at  paragraph  32.   The
   case did not involve any interference with family  life,  as  the  family
   would be returning only as a unit.  The judge correctly noted nothing  to
   suggest any adverse effects  of  return  to  Ghana,  where  education  is
   available to a reasonable standard, and where the  first  two  appellants
   were educated; and nothing to suggest that the children would not be able
   to forge new friendships and continue to develop, or that the  first  two
   appellants would be unable to find  employment  and  to  continue  church
   activities.  Even if the conclusion would have been better  expressed  as
   "no disproportionate breach of Article 8  interests",  the  determination
   reached a correct answer for adequately  explained  reasons,  and  should
   stand.

7) I indicated that I was not persuaded  that  the  determination  contained
   any error such as to require it to be set aside.

8) The  judge  went  rather  far  in  concluding  on  the  basis  of  modest
   overdrafts that  the  appellants  could  not  maintain  themselves.   The
   running of a permitted overdraft is not evidence of general inability  to
   self-maintain.  Many people regularly run overdrafts  without  having  to
   call for public financial relief.   However, I agree with the  Presenting
   Officer that this is a small point, of no significance to the outcome.

9) The legal framework around  Article  8  might  have  been  set  out  more
   extensively, but that is no reason to find error in a determination which
   arrives at the correct decisive questions.  The determination  explicitly
   considers Article 8 both within and outwith the terms of the  Rules.   It
   is well  established  that  a  "near  miss"  (in  respect  of  the  third
   appellant's age) is not a good reason for allowing an  appeal  -  Miah  &
   Others v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 261.  The judge's summary  of  the  private
   life interests leaves nothing out.  Mr  Pall  in  course  of  submissions
   accepted my observation that the case was not run  (and  could  not  have
   been run) on the basis that there is anything  seriously  detrimental  to
   the best interests of the children as a potential  consequence  of  their
   return to Ghana.  The evidence failed to disclose anything about the best
   interests of the children or otherwise in respect of private  life  which
   might have outweighed the application  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
   judge disposed of the case correctly both outside and inside the Rules.

10) The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

11) No anonymity order has been requested or made.
