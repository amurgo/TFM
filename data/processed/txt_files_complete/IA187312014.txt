Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Miss A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant and the Decision

1.   The Appellant, Rachel Nyambura Neumunn, was born on 29  June  1965,  so
    that she is now aged 49, and is a citizen of Kenya.

2.   The Sponsor, Mr Danny Neumunn, was born on 1 July 1953, so that  he  is
    now aged 61, and is a British  citizen.   He  is  the  husband  of  the
    Appellant.

3.   The Appellant applied for further leave  to  remain  in  the  UK  under
    Article 8 of the 1950 Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
    Fundamental Freedoms, which is her qualified right to respect  for  her
    private and family  life.   She  appeals  against  a  decision  of  the
    Respondent of 8 April 2014, explained in a Refusal Letter  of  4  April
    2014, refusing her application by reference to the  provisions  of  the
    Immigration Rules addressing private and family life.

The Legal Background

4.   Section 86 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  ("the
    2002 Act") provides that I must allow the appeal  insofar  as  I  think
    that the decision against which it is brought  was  not  in  accordance
    with the  law  (including  Immigration  Rules)  or  that  a  discretion
    exercised  in  making  the  decision   should   have   been   exercised
    differently.  I may consider evidence about any matter which I consider
    relevant  to  the  substance  of  the  decision,   including   evidence
    concerning a matter arising after the date of the decision.

5.   The  onus  of  proof  in  establishing  these  matters  lies  upon  the
    Appellant.   The  standard  of  proof  is  that  of  the   balance   of
    probabilities, as it is also for any related human rights issues,  save
    in relation to issues of  removal,  where  it  is  that  of  reasonable
    likelihood or real risk: Box [2002] UKIAT 02212.

The History of the Appeal

6.   The appeal of the Appellant was heard  by  Judge  Matthews  sitting  at
    Stoke-on-Trent on 28 July 2014.  In a determination of 5  August  2014,
    promulgated two days later, the appeal was dismissed on immigration and
    human rights grounds.  Following the grant of permission  to  appeal  I
    set the determination aside on the basis of material errors of law  and
    directed a full rehearing, which took place before me on 13 April 2015.

7.   The Appellant and her husband attended the rehearing.  So also did  two
    of the five people who have made witness statements in  their  support,
    although they were not invited to give evidence.   The  Appellant  gave
    evidence on oath in English in chief, in  which  she  adopted  her  two
    statements, cross-examination and re-examination.  Her husband, who had
    remained outside the hearing room until this point, then gave  evidence
    on oath in English in chief, in which he adopted  his  two  statements,
    and cross-examination.  Submissions followed, which I have  taken  into
    account, together with the most helpful skeleton argument  prepared  on
    behalf of the Appellant by Mr Collins.  I reserved my determination.

8.   Mr Collins accepted at the outset, with which Miss  Everett  concurred,
    that  the  Appellant  could  not  satisfy  the  requirements   of   the
    Immigration Rules relating to private and family life.  The  issue  was
    therefore whether as a matter of law the Appellant was  entitled  to  a
    freestanding  Article  8  proportionality  assessment.   Miss   Everett
    submitted that she was not and Mr Collins that she was.   If  she  was,
    Miss Everett submitted that it should be determined against her and  Mr
    Collins in her favour.  I reserved my determination.



The Evidence

9.   As stated the evidence comprises the documentary and oral  evidence  of
    the Appellant and her husband and  the  documentary  evidence  of  five
    people who  know  them.   In  evidence  are  household  accounts,  bank
    statements and payslips of the Appellant's husband.   The  evidence  of
    the Appellant and of her husband is broadly consistent, internally  and
    with that of each other. There was no challenge to the evidence,  which
    is not contentious.  I accept the evidence of  the  Appellant  and  her
    husband, and summarise the evidence compendiously.

10.  Born on 29 June  1965  in  Kenya,  of  which  she  is  a  citizen,  the
    Appellant arrived in the UK, at the age of 35, on 21 May 2001.  On  the
    basis directed by an agent she claimed  political  asylum  in  a  false
    identity and nationality.  Conscious that she was doing so, she did not
    attend and was not represented at the  hearing  of  her  appeal  on  25
    September 2002.  In a determination of the same date,  promulgated  two
    days later, Judge Clements dismissed her appeal on political asylum and
    human rights grounds.

11.  The Appellant remained in the UK, without any  lawful  basis  of  stay,
    overstaying in the event for at least eight years.

12.  In June 2010 the Appellant met Danny Neumunn  in  a  pub  in  Coventry.
    They started seeing each other, entered a relationship  and  in  August
    2010 began living together.  On 30 June 2012 they married in a church.

13.  It seems that the Appellant brought herself to the notice of  the  Home
    Office during 2010. Her case was initially considered under the  legacy
    programme. On 8 November 2012 she applied for leave to remain in the UK
    as the wife of her husband.  Her  application  was  refused  without  a
    right of appeal.  She sought judicial review  of  the  decision,  which
    resulted in the further decision of 4  April  2014,  accompanied  by  a
    right of appeal, giving rise to the present appeal.

14.  The Appellant told her husband about her  lack  of  immigration  status
    soon after they started living together, but did  not  explain  to  him
    that she might not be able to remain in the UK.  Her  husband  did  not
    understand immigration law and hoped that she would be able  to  remain
    (oral evidence, questions 23-25, 57-59 of my record ("oral  23-25,  57-
    59")).  The Appellant is not allowed to work in the UK and does not  do
    so.

15.  In Kenya there live the Appellant's brother, sister and  two  children.
    They used to be more regularly in contact but now, as a result  of  the
    inheritance following the death of the Appellant's mother, they are  in
    contact only from time to time.  The Appellant would like to be able to
    take her husband to meet them.

16.  The Appellant and her  husband  both  say  that  they  are  emotionally
    dependent upon each other.  Her husband said that she  had  become  his
    best friend, partner and soulmate and that he could  not  imagine  life
    without her (oral 42, 57).  He never thought that he  would  find  love
    again, as he has done with her.

17.  Her husband would not go and live with her permanently  in  Kenya.   He
    is aged 61, has lived his whole life in the  UK  and  has  never  lived
    elsewhere.  He would lose his employment, salary and state  pension  in
    the UK.  In the UK he has his own children, who include a daughter aged
    28 with a child of her own, who visit him and his wife.   In  Kenya  he
    would stand out and could not blend in.  Other than English he does not
    speak any of the  local  languages.   He  would  not  be  able  to  get
    employment and so would  become  financially  destitute.   Kenya  is  a
    dangerous place in which to live.  In  the  UK  he  works  as  a  lorry
    driver,  earning  more  than  �20,000  per  annum.   He  also  holds  a
    publican's licence, has  managed  pubs,  and  has  a  qualification  in
    electronics, which he does as a hobby.

Article 8 of the 1950 Convention

18.  As stated, it is common ground that the Appellant  cannot  satisfy  the
    requirements of Appendix FM and of paragraph 276ADE of the  Immigration
    Rules, which relate respectively to family and private life.  The issue
    is therefore  whether  as  a  matter  of  law  she  is  entitled  to  a
    freestanding Article 8 proportionality assessment.  If she is not,  the
    appeal must be dismissed.

19.  MM (Lebanon) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985 at  paragraph  128  per  Aikens
    L.J., R v SSHD on the application of Aliyu [2014] EWHC 3191 (Admin)  at
    paragraph 59 per Deputy High Court Judge Grubb and Singh v SSHD  [2015]
    EWCA Civ 74 at paragraph 64 per Underhill L.J. concur in  holding  that
    where all the issues in an appeal have been addressed in  consideration
    under the Immigration Rules there  is  no  need  for  a  full  separate
    Article 8 examination, which is needed only where  there  are  arguable
    good grounds that the Immigration Rules do not adequately deal with  an
    individual's circumstances relevant to an  Article  8  assessment.   PG
    (USA) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 118 held  at  paragraphs  16  and  17  per
    Fulford L.J. that because  the  Immigration  Rules  do  not  provide  a
    "complete code" the proportionality test will be more at large,  albeit
    guided by the Huang tests and by UK and Strasbourg case law.

20.  The five Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 tests are:

         "(1) Is the decision an interference by a public authority with the
             right to respect for private life (which includes the right to
             physical and moral integrity) or family life?

         (2)  If so,  will  that  interference  have  consequences  of  such
             gravity as potentially to attain the minimum level of severity
             required to engage Article 8?

         (3)  If so, is that interference in accordance with the law?

         (4)  If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society
             in the interests of national security, public  safety  or  the
             economic well-being of  the  country,  or  the  prevention  of
             disorder or crime, for the protection of health or  morals  or
             for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?

         (5)  If so, is  the  interference  proportionate  in  a  democratic
             society to the legitimate aim to be  achieved,  which  is  the
             preservation  of  effective  immigration   control   (or,   as
             subsequently developed in relation to deportation  cases,  the
             prevention of crime and disorder)?"

21.  It seems to me that a way of summarising the  recent  jurisprudence  is
    effectively  to  restate  the  second  Razgar   question.    Will   the
    interference with an Appellant's right to respect for  his  private  or
    family life have consequences of such gravity as potentially to  engage
    the operation of Article 8?

22.  In this as in so many cases this question could be answered  in  either
    way.   I  have  ultimately  concluded  that  it  should   be   answered
    affirmatively.  The Appellant is happily married at the age  of  49  to
    and in  an  emotionally  interdependent  relationship  with  a  British
    citizen of 61 whose entire life has been anchored in  the  UK  and  who
    cannot as a British and an EU citizen be required to accompany  her  to
    live in Kenya and says that he would not do so.  The dismissal  of  her
    appeal would therefore entail the termination of her marriage.

23.  If the Immigration  Rules  engage  with  her  situation,  they  do  not
    entirely engage with the consequences.  They are not  a  complete  code
    and the contemporary  jurisprudence  leads  me  to  conclude  that  the
    Appellant is entitled to the benefit of an  Article  8  proportionality
    assessment.

Proportionality Assessment

24.  The Appellant's husband is a British and  an  EU  citizen,  who  cannot
    therefore be required to leave  the  UK:  Sanade  and  Others  (British
    children - Zambrano - Dereci) [2012] UKUT  00048  (IAC).   Nor  can  he
    reasonably be expected  to  contemplate  doing  so.   Aged  61,  he  is
    financially tied to the UK, and would lose his employment,  salary  and
    state pension in Kenya, where he says that it would be  very  difficult
    for him to find employment so that he would be  financially  destitute.
    His own children and grandchild live in the UK and visit him.  He fears
    not blending into Kenyan society.  He also  fears  for  his  safety  in
    Kenya, although there is no background evidence  to  substantiate  this
    fear.  Kenya has suffered two  major  terrorist  atrocities  in  recent
    times, but that does not establish  that  it  is  generally  an  unsafe
    country in which to live.

25.  The Appellant lived in Kenya for the first 35 years of her  life.   Her
    brother, sister and two children live there, and she is in contact with
    them, even if not regularly.  She is keen for her husband to visit them
    and so does not have a bad relationship with them.

26.   The  Appellant  has  a  culpable  immigration  history.   She   sought
    political asylum in a false identity and nationality and  when  it  was
    refused overstayed for  at  least  eight  years.   Her  culpability  is
    mitigated only by her having  drawn  back  from  perjuring  herself  by
    deciding not to attend the hearing of her political asylum appeal.  She
    brought  herself  to  official  notice  perhaps   initially   to   seek
    eligibility under the legacy programme and then in  the  light  of  her
    relationship with her husband.

27.  Sections 117A-117D of the 2002 Act, inserted by Section 19 of the  2014
    Act, are essentially a further elaboration of the fifth Razgar question
    about proportionality: Dube (ss. 117A-117D) [2015]  UKUT  00090  (IAC).
    The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in  the  public
    interest.  The Appellant is able to speak  English  fluently.   Through
    her husband, who earns more than �20,000 per annum, she is  financially
    independent.  Both factors are in the public interest.  Her husband  is
    a British citizen and thus a qualifying partner.  Little weight  is  to
    be given to a private life or a relationship formed with  a  qualifying
    partner that is established by a person at a time when the person is in
    the United Kingdom unlawfully.  Little weight is also to be given to  a
    private life established by a person  at  a  time  when  that  person's
    immigration status is precarious.  The Appellant's  immigration  status
    has been precarious since the dismissal of her political asylum  appeal
    in September 2002, and her relationship with her husband was formed  at
    a time when she was in the United Kingdom unlawfully.  She  appears  to
    be integrated into British life. Her separation from her husband  would
    involve great  distress  to  both  of  them,  and  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities the effective end of their marriage, which  could  hardly
    be maintained through the  oft  quoted  medium  of  modern  methods  of
    communication.

28.  Both parties made submissions about  the  reasonableness  of  requiring
    the Appellant to return to Kenya in order to make  an  entry  clearance
    application.  There was discussion about how long the  entry  clearance
    process might take  in  Kenya,  about  which  the  Appellant  submitted
    evidence after the hearing. As identified in SSHD  v  Hayat  (Pakistan)
    [2012] EWCA Civ 1054 at paragraph 29, the test stated at paragraph 9 of
    Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40 is:

          "The real question was  not  whether  there  were  'insurmountable
         obstacles' to the applicant returning to Pakistan in order to  make
         an application for entry clearance from there,  but  whether  there
         was any sensible reason as to why he should be required to do so."

29.  Hayat was further considered  in  Thakral  v  SSHD  [2015]  UKUT  00096
    (IAC), holding that the Chikwamba principle  is  only  engaged  if  the
    Respondent has refused the application "on the procedural  ground  that
    the policy requires that the applicant should have made the application
    from his home state"; see especially paragraphs 11,  12.   The  Refusal
    Letter in the present appeal does not address this issue.  So it may be
    that, on the authority of Thakral, the issue does not arise at all.  In
    any event, though, it does not seem to  me  to  be  significant.   Miss
    Everett submitted that this was far from a case in which it  was  clear
    that an application for entry clearance made from abroad would succeed.
     Mr Collins accepted at the outset that the present  appeal  could  not
    succeed under the Immigration Rules.  An application made  from  abroad
    would involve if not identical then very similar considerations,  which
    so far as I can judge would probably  result  in  the  refusal  of  the
    application.  So the issue seems to me on any basis to be peripheral.

30.  I summarise.  The maintenance of effective immigration  control  is  in
    the  public  interest:  ss.117A-117D  of  the   2002   Act.    In   the
    proportionality balancing exercise the scales do not start at  an  even
    balance.  In normal circumstances interference with family life will be
    justified by  the  requirements  of  fair  and  consistent  immigration
    control.  The starting point is the need to maintain that control,  and
    it will be difficult for an appellant who has no claim to remain  under
    the Immigration  Rules  to  outweigh  its  impact  by  establishing  an
    entitlement to remain under Article 8:  LK  (Serbia)  [2007]  EWCA  Civ
    1554.  An even handed  application  of  the  proportionality  test  was
    likely in most  cases  to  result  in  the  finding  that  removal  was
    proportionate: KR (Iraq) [2007] EWCA Civ 514; WB (Pakistan) [2009] EWCA
    Civ 215.

31.  Little weight is to be  given  to  the  Appellant's  private  life  and
    relationship formed when she was in the United Kingdom  unlawfully  and
    her immigration status was precarious.  She has a poor  and  deceptive,
    even if slightly mitigated, immigration history.  She overstayed in the
    UK, waiting at least eight years before bringing  herself  to  official
    attention when she had reason to hope that this  would  result  in  her
    being granted leave to remain.

32.  The Appellant's claim is based upon her marriage to her  husband.   She
    is now aged 49 and he 61.  They are  economically  self-sufficient  and
    she  speaks  English  fluently.  Her  husband  cannot  be  required  to
    accompany her to Kenya, and there are many  reasons  why  he  considers
    that he cannot do so.

33.  In short the Appellant seeks to preserve a marriage entered into  at  a
    time when she was in the United Kingdom unlawfully and her  immigration
    status was precarious.  This was  based  upon  an  adverse  immigration
    history involving deception and overstaying for at least  eight  years.
    Neither she or her husband had  any  legitimate  expectation  that  she
    would become entitled to remain.

34.  In short the public interest is weighty whilst  the  private  life  and
    relationship of the Appellant, aggravated  by  a  culpable  immigration
    history, bears little weight.  The other  factors  in  the  Appellant's
    favour do not displace that balance.  Recognising  the  distress  which
    this will cause to the Appellant and her husband, I conclude that their
    qualified right to  respect  for  their  private  and  family  life  is
    outweighed by the public  interest  in  the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration control.

35.  I accordingly dismiss the appeal, under the Immigration  Rules  and  on
    Article 8 human rights grounds.
