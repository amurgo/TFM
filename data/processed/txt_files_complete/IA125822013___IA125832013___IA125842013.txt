Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr R Nalim, Counsel instructed by M K Suri & Co
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Kiss, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The first appellant is a national of Sri Lanka, born  on  27th  October
    1973.  The second and third appellants are his wife and dependant child
    respectively.

2.   The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 27th November 2008  upon
    a valid student visa and obtained subsequent  extensions  of  leave  in
    that capacity up to 1 September, 2012.  Thereafter, he sought leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 Migrant.  The respondent refused to grant such leave
    by a decision of 4 April, 2013.

3.   The appellant sought to appeal  against  that  decision,  which  appeal
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Devittie on 21  September,  2013.
    The appeal was dismissed both under the Immigration Rules and  also  in
    respect of human rights.

4.   Grounds of appeal were submitted against that decision  and  permission
    to appeal was granted on 31 October, 2012.

5.   Thus it is that the matter comes before me in pursuance of that  leave.



6.   A number of documents were presented  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge and are before me also.

7.    Essentially,  the  application  submitted  on  30  August,   2012   is
    essentially to be that of a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur).

8.   It is contended that that application was made during the  currency  of
    the then Immigration Rules which were amended on 31 January, 2013.  The
    respondent took eight months to consider  the  application  and  it  is
    contended that in all the circumstances  the  application  should  have
    been considered in the light of the Rules which applied at the time  of
    the application.  It is contended that at the time of  the  application
    the first appellant had submitted the necessary evidence to demonstrate
    that he met the requirements of the Immigration Rules, for example that
    the SOC code need not be supplied on the form.

9.   Complaint is made that the respondent did not, in  the  event,  operate
    her flexibility policy and should have requested those documents  which
    were required to meet the new Rules in any event.

10.  It is contended by the first  appellant  that  the  documents  required
    under the Immigration Rules as at the  time  of  the  application  were
    submitted.  They are set out as six items  under  paragraph  6  of  the
    grounds of appeal.

11.  On 5 March 2013 the respondent requested by e-mail a  number  of  other
    documents in the following terms:-

         "A bank statement on original headed paper from your  client's  3rd
         party sponsor, confirming the amount of money available to  him  in
         the United Kingdom.  Please refer to  the  published  guidance  for
         further details of the  format  in  which  this  letter  should  be
         presented.


         Original bank statements from your client's  sponsor  Mr  Syed  Ali
         Raza Bukhari.  A more detailed contract that demonstrates  what  is
         actually involved in the work your client is doing on a day to  day
         basis.


         Without this evidence we will not  be  able  to  award  points  for
         access to funds required, and  the  application  will  have  to  be
         refused.


         Please note that we are only able to accept the documents  received
         within UK Border Agency within 7 working days of  this  email.   We
         therefore strongly recommend that you send the documents by special
         next day delivery.  No further  extension  will  be  given  if  the
         requested information is not provided within the seven days."

12.  In response to that letter:

    (i)   a  bank  letter  on  original  headed  notepaper  from  the  bank
         confirming the money that is available in the United Kingdom;


    (ii) a declaration from the third party sponsor,


    (iii)    legal  representative's  letter  confirming  the  third  party
         sponsor's signature.

     Also there were original bank statements and  a  Service  Contract  for
    Alpha Meridian College and a Service Contract for East London College.

13.  The Reasons for Refusal Letter is a lengthy one dated 4 April 2013.

14.  In summary, the respondent expressed two areas of concern.   The  first
    was that the appellant had to show that he had access to no  less  than
    �50,000 from a third party.  It is contended that the  documents  which
    were submitted did not establish that fact and secondly were not in the
    format or form that was required under the  Immigration  Rules  in  any
    event.

15.  It was the case for  the  appellant  that  his  business  was  that  of
    business  development.   It  was  noted   by   the   respondent   that,
    notwithstanding the many letters from the colleges and  contracts  from
    colleges,  such did not establish or reflect the duties claimed to have
    been undertaken by the appellant in his business role.

16.  It was thus for the first appellant to show  that  he  was  engaged  in
    business activity, within the framework which appeared on the  list  of
    occupations in the Skilled National Qualifications Framework  level  as
    stated the Codes of Practice in Appendix J and to provide the specified
    evidence in paragraph 41-SD.  It was for him to show that he was active
    in the job title which he had indicated as being part of his  business,
    that is the management educational solutions limited.

17.  The Judge found that the appellant  had failed to produce  evidence  to
    show that the funds of his business partner were available to  him  and
    therefore did not satisfy the requirements of the Rules. Secondly, that
    the various contracts that had been presented by the appellant did  not
    establish that he would engage in business as  a  business  development
    manager.  The Judge also considered Article 8 and found that  that  was
    not engaged.

18.  It is manifest that the Immigration Rules, relating to bank  statements
    and how they are presented and what evidence they are  to  contain,  is
    extremely complex.  The requirements are set out in paragraph 41-SD and
    all the paragraphs and sub-paragraphs relating thereto.

19.  Part of the problem, as identified by the appellant in  his  statement,
    was that he was required under those Rules to obtain from  the  bank  a
    letter confirming that the money the third party has in the  bank  will
    be available to him for his application.  The  bank  refused  to  write
    such a letter, stating that it was  a  private  agreement  between  the
    third party and the appellant.  A number of  documents  were  submitted
    with the  application  including  bank  statements  to  show  funds  of
    �50,000.  Also a letter from the bank to confirm that  the  funds  were
    available in the United Kingdom and a declaration from the third  party
    confirming that the money was available to the appellant.  He could not
    see that he could do much more.  He contended therefore that a  refusal
    on the basis as specified in the Reasons for Refusal  Letter  was  both
    unreasonable and unfair.  I need not spend much time  looking  at  this
    matter because Ms Kiss, who  represents  the  respondent,  most  fairly
    conceded that that requirement  demanded of the first appellant was for
    an institutional rather than a personal investor and  therefore  should
    not have been applied against the appellant. To that  extent  therefore
    the findings of the Judge were incorrect.

20.  Ms Kiss ,however, submits that it is not material  to  the  outcome  of
    the case because the evidence that is relied upon by the  appellant  as
    to the amount of funds in the bank is far from clear.

21.  The appellant's solicitors, under cover of a letter of 13  March  2013,
    sought to  produce  a  bank  letter  confirming  the  amount  of  money
    available to the sponsor in the United Kingdom together  with  original
    bank statements and declarations from the third party.   Leaving  aside
    the evidential difficulties, which paragraph 85A will  present  to  the
    production of further evidence after the application was  made,  it  is
    clear from those documents, submits Ms Kiss, that they  really  do  not
    show �50,000 in the sponsor's account in any event for any period other
    than for a period of nine days from 4  December  2012  to  13  December
    2012.  There is little to assist the appellant in that regard.

22.  However she submits that,  notwithstanding  the  request  made  by  the
    respondent, no documentation by way of contract has  been  provided  to
    justify the nature of the work  which  the  appellant  claims  that  he
    undertakes in the United Kingdom such as to fund  his  application  for
    leave to remain.  Thus, at C4 of the respondent's bundle, is a contract
    dated 20 August 2012 from the East London College.  It  is  a  contract
    for the post of a part-time lecturer.  It provides  that  the  lecturer
    shall attend during standard hours, at  a  location  specified  and  in
    other places where the college may reasonably direct.

23.  At C8 of the respondent's bundle is the schedule to be  read  with  the
    agreement.   There  is  nothing,  she  submits,  other  than  that  the
    appellant was employed as a lecturer.  There is no  indication  of  any
    business development or consultancy role in that document.

24.  The appellant has also produced a  contract  from  the  Alpha  Meridian
    College.  Again the job description  in  terms  for  that  contract  of
    employment commencing on 14  September  2012  is  as  a  lecturer.   It
    specifies the times working and  teaching.   Once  again  there  is  no
    reference to any business management or consultancy in that  particular
    contract.

25.  She invites me,  therefore,  to  find  that  the  Judge  was  perfectly
    entitled, on a factual basis, to find that there was nothing within the
    contracts to support the claimed work.  These were  documents  provided
    on 13 March 2013 in pursuance to the request made by the respondent.

26.  It is contended, however,  that  there  was  before  the  respondent  a
    Service Contract which had not been properly taken into account.   That
    is to be found at page 20 of the appellant's main bundle  of  documents
    and is a contract made on 23 August  2012  between  Oxbridge  Solutions
    Limited and Management  Education  Solutions  Limited.   It  speaks  of
    providing IT marketing consultancy services from 1 November 2012 to  30
    April 2013.

27.  That contract gives very little by way  of  detail  precisely  what  is
    involved in the services that are to be provided and how they are to be
    provided.

28.  Mr Raza Nalim, who represents the appellant, invites me  to  find  that
    the document at least should have put the respondent on enquiry to have
    asked for further details  if  not  satisfied  with  what  was  in  the
    contract.  He relies upon the flexibility policy.

29.  It seems to me, however, that that is a  reliance  which  is  misguided
    because it was demonstrated  by  the  request  of  5  March  2013  that
    evidence was requested concerning what was  actually  involved  in  the
    work that the appellant was doing on a  day-to-day  basis.   In  making
    that request it seems to me that the respondent acted entirely  fairly.
    The documents, however, that were produced, namely the Service Contract
    for Alpha Meridian College and that for East London College did nothing
    to assist the appellant's case whatsoever.

30.  I find therefore that the approach taken  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  that the appellant had not properly  or  clearly  disclosed  the
    nature of his business, role and responsibilities  was  entirely  well-
    founded.  In those circumstances I detect no material error of  law  in
    the decision relating to the Immigration Rules themselves.

31.  It is contended, however, that the Judge erred in  the  approach  taken
    to Article 8 of the ECHR by failing to consider  that  the  Immigration
    Rules had changed and had failed to consider  the  private  and  family
    life of the appellants.

32.  So far as the change in the  Immigration  Rules  is  concerned,  albeit
    that there may have been certain changes of requirement, the reality of
    both the old Rule and the new was the same, namely that there should be
    clear evidence adduced as to the nature and substance of  the  business
    of the appellant.  Thus, I detect little material change as between the
    old Rule and the more recent Rule in the practical application  of  the
    evidence to the issues.

33.  It is contended that the Judge failed to have regard to  the  interests
    of all parties.  The first appellant had come as a mature  student  and
    had completed his studies and his family had come to join him.  He  had
    invested a great deal of money into the business which he would lose if
    he had to return to his home country.  He argued  that  it  was  wholly
    disproportionate to subject himself and the second and third appellants
    to such an upheaval all for the sake of some lack of detail he provided
    about his business.  It was submitted that the Immigration  Rules  were
    unduly complicated and that in those circumstances it was  unreasonable
    to uphold the detail against the appellants in all  the  circumstances.
    It was submitted that family life  should  be  respected,  particularly
    having regard to what was said in Huang [2007] UKHL 11  (2007)  2HC167,
    in particular by reason of paragraph 54 thereof.

34.  It was submitted that had the Judge looked at matters  as  a  whole  it
    would have followed that removal was disproportionate.

35.  Ms Kiss invited my attention to the decision of Miah &  Others  v  SSHD
    [2012] EWCA Civ 261.  In that case the Court of Appeal  considered  the
    "near-miss argument".  It  was  argued  that  the  more  the  appellant
    effected substantial compliance with the Rules the  less  it  could  be
    said that immigration policy requires his  removal.  The  Secretary  of
    State  however  contended  that  the  public  interest  in  maintaining
    immigration control requires that the Rules be complied with  and  that
    an assessment of the degree of non-compliance with the Rules  plays  no
    part in the assessment required by Article 8.

36.  The Court of Appeal upheld the contention that there  is  no  near-miss
    principle applicable to the Immigration Rules. Rather.the Secretary  of
    State, and on appeal the Tribunal,  must  assess  the  strength  of  an
    Article 8  claim.   The  requirement  of  immigration  control  is  not
    weakened by the degree of non-compliance with the Immigration Rules.

37.  It seems to me however, and I so find, that the near-miss  argument  is
    not one that is necessarily applicable to  the  circumstances  of  this
    case.  The Immigration Rules require the  appellant  to  submit  proper
    details as to the monies available to him and the nature  of  the  work
    that he intends and is carrying  out.   The  appellant  has  failed  to
    provide all relevant material in any event.   Such  documents  as  have
    been supplied more recently serve to undermine rather  than  strengthen
    that position.

38.  In terms of private and family life, there is  a  paucity  of  material
    presented  in  any  event.   The  statement  of  the  appellant  merely
    indicates that he  has  invested  �12,000  in  his  business  and  will
    probably go bankrupt if not granted a visa, because he will have to pay
    back the third party money that he has used  and  spent.   He  contends
    that he is a genuine entrepreneur.

39.  There is a statement from  the  second  appellant  dated  19  September
    2013.  She and the third appellant joined the first appellant in  April
    2011.  They now have a small baby, Oneesha, born in October  2012.   On
    any reading therefore they have been but a short  time  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The third appellant was born on 5 April 2003.

40.  She speaks in terms of  it  having  been  very  stressful  and  of  the
    financial implications for the refusal of the  application.   She  does
    not however specify any  particular  family  or  personal  difficulties
    which will arise.  No doubt she is much occupied with looking after the
    children and there is no indication that she is working.

41.  I find that this is a situation in which the  appellants  as  a  family
    would be returning to Sri Lanka.  There is little indication  that  the
    best interests of the third appellant would  not  be  served  otherwise
    than being with his parents.   There  is  no  indication  that  he  has
    arrived in any particular significant stage in his  development  or  in
    his education such that relocation, if returned  to  Sri  Lanka,  would
    adversely affect him or his situation.

42.  The first appellant came to the United Kingdom on the basis of being  a
    student and seemingly has completed that for which  he  came.   It  may
    well be that in time he will make a positive  contribution  to  society
    both in the terms of the business that he develops and the money  which
    he pays into the economy.

43.  The second appellant describes at paragraphs 4 and 5 what  it  is  that
    her husband,d does.  It is unfortunate that the first appellant has not
    clarified those matters, even to date.

44.  The appellants do not meet  the  Immigration  Rules  through  no  fault
    other than themselves.  I detect no unfairness in the procedures or  in
    the  treatment  of   them   by   the   respondent.    I   see   nothing
    disproportionate in their return.

45.  Complaint is made that the Judge  failed  to  adequately  consider  the
    issues of Article 8, in particular the best  interests  of  the  child.
    There may be criticism of the Judge in that respect in  that  it  would
    seem that the Judge focused in paragraph 7 of  the  determination  more
    upon the first appellant, than the other appellants.

46.  Clearly, my task is not to substitute what I may  think  of  the  facts
    from those of the Judge  unless  there  be  a  material  error  in  the
    approach.   Clearly  the  Judge  was  in  a  degree  of  error  in  not
    specifically  considering  the  interests  of  the  second  and   third
    appellants but even if that had been done, there is nothing as  I  have
    indicated in the statements or evidence presented  that  would  provide
    any significant platform to mount a successful Article 8 claim.

47.  In all the circumstances therefore I do not find  that  the  Judge  has
    fallen into material error in the approach taken to the facts  of  this
    particular case.  I find that it was properly open  to  the  Judge  and
    indeed adequate reasons were given why the first appellant did not meet
    the strict requirements of the Immigration Rules.  I find the Judge had
    considered, albeit more generally, Article 8 of the  ECHR.   I  do  not
    find that there are any matters which the Judge has omitted which could
    have been presented to the Judge or should have been asked for  by  the
    Judge that would have made only a small difference to  the  outcome  of
    the decision.

48.  In all the  circumstances  therefore  the  appeal  is  dismissed.   The
    original decisions of the Judge shall stand, namely that the appeal  is
    dismissed under the Immigration Rules and  dismissed  on  human  rights
    grounds.
