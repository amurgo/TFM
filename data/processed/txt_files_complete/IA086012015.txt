For the Appellant:     Mr M West, Counsel; instructed by Shan & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Ahmad, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant, a citizen of Zimbabwe, born on [ ] 1964, appeals against
    the decision of the Respondent refusing her application  for  leave  to
    remain based upon her private life and family life as  the  partner  of
    under Article 8 ECHR.

 2. The Appellant was granted leave to enter the UK as a visitor  until  31
    July 2002. On 29 July 2002 she submitted an application  for  leave  to
    remain in the UK as a student which was rejected. She  resubmitted  her
    application within 7 days  and  was  subsequently  successful  in  that
    application on 6 February 2003 and was given leave  until  30  November
    2004. On 30 January 2004, the Appellant submitted  an  application  for
    leave as a student which was granted on 22 February 2004 until 31 March
    2005. On 30 March 2005,  she  submitted  a  further  application  as  a
    student which was rejected on 18  April  2005.  On  13  May  2005,  the
    Appellant then submitted an application for leave to remain in  the  UK
    as student, which was refused with no right of  appeal  on  9  November
    2005.

 3. On 21 September 2006, the Appellant submitted an application for  leave
    to remain in the UK as a Dependant  Spouse,  which  was  voided  on  23
    October 2006. On 19 August 2009, she submitted an application for leave
    to remain in the UK outside the provisions of the Immigration Rules  on
    compassionate  grounds,  which  was  granted  on  14  April  2011.  The
    Appellant was granted Discretionary Leave until 14 April  2014  on  the
    basis that it was unreasonable to expect her child, [SC], to leave  the
    UK based on the length of time he had lived in the  UK.  Unfortunately,
    on 13 October 2013, [SC], passed away.

 4. On 31 March 2014, the Appellant submitted an application for  leave  to
    remain in the UK on Family and Private Life grounds, which was rejected
    on 15 April 2014. On 10 May 2014, she submitted a  further  application
    for leave to remain in the UK on Family and Private Life grounds, which
    was also rejected on 11 July 2014. On  1  August  2014,  the  Appellant
    submitted an application for leave to remain in the UK  on  Family  and
    Private Life grounds, which was refused on 10  October  2014.  In  that
    application the Appellant did not claim to be in  a  relationship  with
    anyone.

 5. On 28 October 2014, she submitted a Pre-Action Protocol  letter,  which
    was responded to on 12 November 2014. The Appellant also  sent  letters
    dated 18 October  2014  and  2  December  2014  with  enclosures  which
    resulted in a further consideration and the  refusal  letter  dated  10
    February 2015 which gave rise to her  appeal.  The  Appellant  appealed
    pursuant to section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002 ("the 2002 Act") to the  First-tier  Tribunal  which  allowed  her
    appeal. However, that determination was appealed by the Respondent  and
    was set aside by me for material error of law. Consequently the  appeal
    now arises before me without any findings of fact preserved.

The Hearing

 6. The Appellant's solicitors had  provided  a  previous  bundle  for  the
    purposes of the last hearing before the Upper Tribunal and  provided  a
    further bundle for the purposes of the de novo hearing. The  Respondent
    had also provided a copy of her previous bundle.

 7. I heard evidence from the Appellant and her partner in English. A  full
    note of their evidence is set out in my record of proceedings  which  I
    shall not rehearse herein.

Findings of Fact and Reasons

   8. The standard of proof is to the civil standard and that of the balance
      of probability. I have considered all  the  evidence  in  the  appeal,
      including the appellant's and respondent's bundles and the authorities
      I have been referred to. I heard submissions from both  parties  which
      are set out in full in my record of proceedings.

   9. I find that the Appellant and her partner gave credible and  plausible
      evidence overall that was corroborative of one another  and  I  accept
      their oral evidence I heard as set out below.

  10. At the outset, Ms Ahmad did not seek to challenge my preliminary  view
      in my error of law decision that the previous  determination  was  not
      unsafe for finding  that  the  Appellant  and  her  partner  satisfied
      GEN.1.2. Therefore, for the sake of completeness, I  shall  repeat  my
      views herein upon how the couple satisfy GEN.1.2. in brief  terms.  In
      respect of GEN.1.2 the relevant Immigration Rule reads as follows:

         For the purposes of this Appendix 'partner' means -

         (iv) A person who has been living together with the applicant in  a
         relationship akin to a marriage or civil partnership for  at  least
         two years prior to the date  of  application,  unless  a  different
         meaning of partner applies elsewhere in this Appendix.

11. Albeit that the Appellant's partner ([I]) did not move in finally  with
    the Appellant until 2015, the partner  had  previously  spent  weekends
    living with the Appellant at various addresses in Reading and any  time
    when he was not employed in "shift" work, as well as spending time with
    his niece and nephew at a nearby address.

12. To my mind, the interpretation of a partner should not be restricted to
    a person who has been living as it were on  a  full-time  basis  or  on
    consecutive days of each day  of  the  year  with  their  partner.  The
    overarching theme from the above rule is that the applicant  should  be
    living with their partner in a relationship akin to  marriage  for  two
    years.  I find that on any interpretation  the  relationship  has  been
    subsisting since 2009 for a matter of some seven  years  now.   I  find
    that  the  Appellant  and  her  partner  were  living  together  in   a
    relationship akin to marriage for at least two years prior to the  date
    of application.  I accept that  the  Appellant  and  partner  were  not
    living together on a day-to-day basis but  on  weekends  and  when  the
    partner had time available when he was not working his shift or looking
    after his niece and nephew, as was his responsibility.  In my view, the
    partner's duties and obligations do not detract from the fact that  the
    relationship  that  the  couple  were  enjoying,  and  living  together
    substantially in order to enjoy, was one that was akin to marriage.

13. The fact that the couple were not living together on a day-to-day basis
    is not something which the Rules explicitly require and for my  part  I
    read the Rules as focussing more upon the nature  of  the  relationship
    and the length which the couple have been living together  towards  the
    subsistence of that relationship rather than the frequency  of  day-to-
    day cohabitation.  Indeed there  are  partners  who  live  together  in
    relationships akin to marriage but are not able to spend each and every
    day with each other but it is not to be said that they  are  not  truly
    living together if their  obligations  and  duties  force  them  to  go
    elsewhere at times, particularly if  those  are  matters  beyond  their
    control. The rules are rules, and must be read  as  such,  and  in  the
    absence of an explicit requirement of  a  continuous  2-year  residence
    requirement, I find that the Appellant and her partner satisfy GEN.1.2.
    Notwithstanding my findings on GEN.1.2., it is also  relevant  to  note
    that the reason the Appellant and partner  have  not  married  and  are
    still planning to get married is because they are waiting for the court
    outcome so they can retrieve the Appellant's documents because  without
    them, they can only register to marry but cannot obtain a date to marry
    without having both sets of documentation. Whilst this has  no  bearing
    at all on GEN.1.2., it is an important part of the  backdrop  to  their
    relationship history. It could be said based  on  this  evidence  alone
    that they also satisfy GEN.1.2. as fianc�e  and  fianc�  with  a  clear
    intention of marrying.

  14. Aside from GEN.1.2., the agreed position between the parties was  that
      my findings needed to extend to  the  Appellant's  family  life  under
      Appendix FM EX.1, her private life under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi),  and
      so  far  as  necessary,  whether  there  were  any  factors  requiring
      consideration under exceptional circumstances outside the rules  under
      Article 8 ECHR.

  15. In respect of the rules, the parties agreed that the  Appellant  meets
      the suitability requirements but not the eligibility requirements  due
      her  submitting  insufficient  specified  evidence  to   satisfy   the
      financial requirements. The parties acknowledged that evidence of  the
      Appellant's and her partner's finances were mentioned at 14, 18, 21 of
      Judge Sweet's decision. That  evidence  remains  unchallenged  and  is
      therefore adopted by me in the following summary terms. The  Appellant
      and her partner share a joint bank account,  and  the  partner's  bank
      statements show that he earns approximately �2000 net per  month.  [I]
      (the partner) works for three separate agencies as a  contract  worker
      as both a cleaner and a carer. He works at Porsche  in  Reading  as  a
      cleaner and he is a carer  at  two  hospitals,  namely  Thornton  Park
      Mental Health hospital, and Little More Hospital in Oxford.

  16. I also heard evidence from the Appellant and [I] which  Ms  Ahmad  did
      not seek to challenge, namely that [I] (the Appellant's partner)  pays
      the household bills and pays for food and their daily needs which  are
      approximately �140 per week. Since the Appellant has  not  worked  [I]
      has in essence supported the couple  since  2012  when  the  Appellant
      ceased employment. [I]'s status is that he has held  indefinite  leave
      to remain since June 2010 however retains his Sierra Leonean passport,
      but nonetheless qualifies as an eligible sponsor under  the  rules  as
      present and settled person.

  17. Had the Appellant and partner provided their financial  evidence  with
      the application and it satisfied the evidentiary requirements, I would
      have been in a position to find that the Appellant met the  rules  for
      leave to remain as a partner given  that  she  broadly  satisfies  the
      other requirements of the rules. However, given that she does  not,  I
      shall go on to consider whether the Appellant  satisfies  Appendix  FM
      EX.1.(b) and whether there are insurmountable obstacles to  relocating
      to Zimbabwe for the couple.

  18. In respect of Appendix FM EX.1.(b), that  provision  under  the  rules
      reads as follows as at 10 February 2015:

         EX.1. This paragraph applies if

         ...

         (b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with  a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled  in  the
         UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection,  and
         there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK.

         EX.2.  For  the  purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
         obstacles" means the very significant difficulties which  would  be
         faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their  family
         life together outside the UK and which could  not  be  overcome  or
         would entail very serious  hardship  for  the  applicant  or  their
         partner.

  19. In reaching my conclusions on the insurmountable obstacles approach, I
      have considered and given full weight to the views  of  the  Court  of
      Appeal at 21, 28, 45 of the judgment in  R,  (on  the  application  of
      Agyarko) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA  Civ
      440 as brought to my attention by Ms Ahmad.

  20. I find that the Appellant is in a genuine and subsisting  relationship
      with a partner, [I], whom is settled in the UK due to  his  indefinite
      leave to remain. As to the question  of  insurmountable  obstacles,  I
      bear in mind that the threshold is a "high" one and  is  significantly
      more demanding than a mere test of whether it would be  reasonable  to
      expect a couple to continue  their  family  life  outside  the  United
      Kingdom. I also bear in mind that there  should  be  very  significant
      difficulties which would be faced by either the Appellant  or  [I]  in
      continuing their family life together outside the UK which  could  not
      be overcome or would entail very serious hardship for the Appellant or
      [I].

  21. Having heard extensive oral evidence on these issues at the  heart  of
      the appeal, my findings in this respect are as follows. I do find that
      there are insurmountable obstacles or  very  significant  difficulties
      which would be faced by both the Appellant and [I] respectively. As  I
      discuss below, these obstacles/difficulties would entail very  serious
      hardship for both of them respectively and cumulatively.

  22. I find that the Appellant has no  family  or  relatives  remaining  in
      Zimbabwe. In her evidence  the  Appellant  confirmed  that  since  she
      arrived here in 2002. When the Appellant arrived she was 38 years  and
      is now 51 years old. Before the Appellant arrived in the  UK  she  was
      working as a receptionist at her brother's company from the age of  20
      until she left. However, since arriving here the  Appellant  has  only
      returned to Zimbabwe twice. The first time  was  with  her  late  son,
      [SC], in order to see where his father had died  in  2010/11  and  the
      second time was on the occasion of her son [SC] dying in October 2013.
      The infrequency of her visits to Zimbabwe in those 14 years shows  how
      little connection the Appellant has with her country of origin. I  was
      particularly compelled  by  the  Appellant's  evidence  that  on  both
      occasions when she returned she was accompanied by bodyguards and  did
      not use her passport when she went across the border but  paid  people
      money to give her a pass to go through. These actions hardly speak  of
      someone whom  can  easily  return  to  their  country  without  facing
      insurmountable obstacles if they do not wish to pass through  official
      channels and have to effectively smuggle themselves in and out of  the
      country under the protection of armed bodyguards. The bodyguards  were
      with the Appellant on both visits and were with her 24/7. I find there
      was a ring of truth in the demeanour and manner in which the  evidence
      gave her testimony on this subject in particular. The  Appellant  only
      went for 2 weeks to Zimbabwe and it is telling that she spent 2 months
      in South Africa by way of comparison. It is  also  pertinent  to  note
      that the Appellant stayed with her niece and other family whom I  find
      have all emigrated to South Africa. I find  that  the  Appellant  only
      went back to Zimbabwe out of compulsion and culture more than her  own
      desire or more importantly rather than any ongoing connection to  that
      country.

  23. I accept  as  plausible  the  Appellant's  evidence  that  her  mother
      previously lived in Zimbabwe but moved away due to  rioting  and  that
      she  fled  to  South  Africa  to  live  with  the  Appellant's  niece.
      Consequently, I also accept the Appellant's evidence that due  to  the
      departure of her mother, there is no one to  support  her  should  she
      return to Zimbabwe. When considering also that the Appellant does  not
      have anywhere she can live, her  qualifications  as  a  carer  do  not
      provide much assistance. This is because there is  no  employment  for
      the Appellant that she can take up.

  24. My finding that there are very  significant  difficulties  that  would
      entail very serious hardship for  the  Appellant  is  exercised  by  a
      combination of the above facts which  I  have  found  to  exist  as  a
      plausible return scenario. This leads me to my first  conclusion  that
      there are insurmountable obstacles for the Appellant should she try to
      continue her family life in Zimbabwe.

  25. In relation to the partner, [I], although I do not  need  to  consider
      the insurmountable obstacles that he will face given  my  findings  in
      relation to the Appellant, I nonetheless consider the effect  for  him
      on continuing his  family  there  for  the  sake  of  completeness.  I
      similarly find that there will be  insurmountable  obstacles  or  very
      significant difficulties for  [I]  which  would  entail  very  serious
      hardship for him.

  26. In relation to the oral evidence, both [I] and  the  Appellant  stated
      that their proposed relocation to Zimbabwe would  have  a  devastating
      effect on their relationship. In relation to [I]'s travel to Zimbabwe,
      I was hindered greatly in making findings on his ability  to  relocate
      there because there was no evidence from either party that could guide
      me as to whether he  might  be  able  to  obtain  entry  clearance  to
      Zimbabwe as a Sierra Leonean national and the unmarried partner  of  a
      Zimbabwean national whom has been absent for almost 14 years. However,
      that exercise may have proved futile as [I] indicated in no  uncertain
      terms that he would not leave  the  UK  without  first  obtaining  his
      British citizenship but also due to the violence and political  unrest
      in that country. Given that [I] has indefinite leave  to  remain,  his
      wish not to leave  as  a  present  and  settled  person  seems  beyond
      question unless there is a reason  why  the  Secretary  of  State  may
      require his removal given  that  he  remains  subject  to  immigration
      control. In that regard, no reason was given by Ms Ahmad why he should
      leave and consequently, it is my view that I his clear  intention  not
      to quit the UK ought to be respected.

  27. Nonetheless, as the rules are framed to discuss  the  continuation  of
      family life in a third country, I must consider such matters, even  if
      they will not come to pass. Moving forward, I find that it will  prove
      a very serious hardship for [I] to relocate to  Zimbabwe  to  continue
      his family life. Leaving aside any issues of entry clearance, there is
      no evidence to indicate that [I] has ever  travelled  to  Zimbabwe  or
      that he has any knowledge whatsoever of the Shona language nor that he
      could obtain work there in a mental health hospital, for example. More
      pressing altogether is the fact that  [I]  needs  to  remain  here  to
      provide support to his nephew whose care he took over after his sister
      (the biological mother) died. This responsibility I find is clearly of
      some importance to [I] given that he sacrificed his time to  care  for
      the nephew (and formerly the niece) and spend time with them.

  28. [I] is  also  providing  financial  support  to  his  nephew  and  the
      Appellant equally. That level of care has decreased as the  niece  has
      started to take on some responsibilities  for  her  and  her  brother,
      however, the fact remains that the nephew, [G] remains a minor  and  I
      do accept that if the Appellant leaves it will be  akin  to  losing  a
      parental figure given that he lost his own mother and became close  to
      the Appellant after her death. I find this evidence  to  be  plausible
      given that the Appellant's late son, [SC], was a brotherly  figure  to
      [G] when his mother passed and the two bonded and  that  it  was  [SC]
      that helped [G] to overcome the death of his mother. In  essence,  the
      family bond that is presented before me is a highly unique and fragile
      one where there have been several untimely deaths that have created an
      unusual bond between the parties. If, as I find, [I] offers  financial
      support alongside buying [G]'s  uniform,  his  bus  pass,  his  mobile
      phone, driving him to and from football matches and that [G] lives 10-
      15 minutes walk away and is over at [I]'s house several times  a  week
      as well as on holidays, the fact remains that severance  of  the  bond
      between [I] and [G] would represent very serious  difficulty  for  the
      family to be ruptured so.

  29. Although I have already concluded in the Appellant's favour concerning
      her insurmountable obstacles, it is clear to me that the severance  of
      her relationship with [G] and [I] would also form a  legitimate  basis
      for very serious hardship in not being able  to  maintain  those  ties
      with her partner and a child whom whilst not her own is the only child
      whom she has left to care for given that [SC], her late son, was close
      to [G] and the two became close before [SC]'s death. To  this  extent,
      it would appear that family life exists between [I] and the  Appellant
      and [G],  although  I  have  not  gone  on  to  consider  this  as  an
      independent  issue  due  to  my  findings  above   on   insurmountable
      obstacles.

  30. For those reasons, I find  that  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles
      preventing family life from continuing  in  Zimbabwe  and  that  there
      would be very serious  difficulty  for  both  the  Appellant  and  her
      partner independent of each other, why the  removal  would  have  that
      disproportionate effect as codified into the immigration rules.

  31. Given my findings above under the Appendix FM, I  do  not  propose  to
      consider the remaining issues on appeal under paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)
      nor Article 8 ECHR in respect of the Appellant's family life  and  her
      private life that may exist outside the immigration rules nor  section
      117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  (given  that
      my consideration has covered the public interest  as  codified  within
      the immigration rules).

Decision

32. The appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.

Anonymity

33. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity order and I  was  not
    asked to make one and do not see reason to do so.

Fee Award

34. I do not make a fee award as my decision is based upon  the  assessment
    of Appendix FM which was presented in a more coherent fashion now  then
    on application it would seem.
