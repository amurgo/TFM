Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant,  the  Secretary  of  State  (hereafter  the  SSHD),  has
    permission to challenge the decision of Judge Hembrough  posted  on  16
    October 2018 allowing the appeal  of  the  respondents  (hereafter  the
    claimants who are husband and wife of  Pakistani  nationality,  against
    the decisions made by the appellant on 30 January 2018 and 7 April 2018
    refusing them leave to remain.

2.   The first claimant's application was refused  under  paragraph  276(ii)
    and (iii) with reference  to  the  general  grounds  of  refusal  under
    paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  The  main  concern  of  the
    SSHD was that following UKVI requesting the  first  claimant  in  April
    2017 to complete a tax questionnaire, it had come to light that whereas
    in the tax year 2010/11 the first  claimant  had  declared  �14,043  as
    income, when applying for Tier 1 (General) leave  to  remain  in  March
    2011, she had claimed �42,133 from  all  sources.   For  the  tax  year
    2012/13 there was a similarly significant  discrepancy  (�21,833  being
    declared to HMRC and (in June 2013) �50,778 being claimed for June 2012
    - June 2013).

3.   Whilst of the view that the SSHD's allegations concerning 2012/13  were
    "misconceived" (paragraph 26), the judge was clearly unimpressed by the
    first claimant's explanation for the discrepancies in relation  to  tax
    year 2011/2012, concluding at paragraphs 25 and 27:

         "25. In the end it comes down to  this  'was  the  first  Appellant
             dishonest or careless?'  The  burden  of  proving  dishonestly
             lies with the Respondent.  Looking at the evidence  before  me
             in the round I cannot but conclude that  the  first  Appellant
             deliberately closed her eyes to the obvious for the purpose of
             gaining a tax advantage and was thus dishonest and  that  this
             is conduct which potentially engages paragraph 322(5) for  the
             reasons given above.


         ...


         27.  It follows from my above findings that the  first  Appellant's
             application potentially fell to  be  refused  under  paragraph
             276(ii) and (iii) with reference to the  general  grounds  for
             refusal under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules."

4.   However, the judge went on to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds.

5.   The SSHD's grounds allege a (a) failure to make clear findings  on  the
    paragraph 322(5) issues; and (b) a  failure  to  factor  in  the  first
    claimant's deception into the proportionality assessment. The SSHD also
    contends that he was also entitled to refuse the claimant's application
    under paragraphs 276(ii) and (iii).

6.   I received succinct submissions from  Mr  Tarlow  and  Mr  Dhanji.   Mr
    Dhanji's submissions broadly amplified those  set  out  in  a  Rule  24
    response.  There was a discussion with both regarding  the  purport  of
    what the judge stated at paragraphs 27-28:

         "27. It follows from my above findings that the  first  Appellant's
             application potentially fell to  be  refused  under  paragraph
             276(ii) and (iii) with reference to the  general  grounds  for
             refusal under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.


         28.  Paragraph 322(5) is a discretionary ground of refusal.  Whilst
             I cannot exercise the Respondent's discretion this is  clearly
             relevant  as  regards  the  issue  of   proportionality   when
             considering Article 8 ECHR."

7.   Mr Tarlow said this showed that the judge had  failed  to  make  proper
    findings under the Rules both because he  only  found  that  the  first
    claimant's application "potentially" fell under  paragraph  322(5)  and
    because he had not  exercised  the  paragraph  322(5)  discretion.   Mr
    Dhanji said that I should read these two paragraphs together as showing
    that the judge made  firm  findings  on  the  substantive  contents  of
    paragraph  322(5)  and  only  refrained  from  exercising   discretion,
    justifiably leaving that to be addressed in the  wider  proportionality
    assessment.

8.   I have no hesitation in upholding the  SSHD's  grounds.   Whatever  the
    judge meant  in  paragraphs  25  and  27  by  stating  that  the  first
    claimant's conduct "potentially" fell under paragraph  322(5),  it  was
    plain that he considered she had used dishonesty.  Thus in paragraph 25
    he described her as "deliberately clos[ing] her eyes to the obvious for
    the purpose of gaining a tax advantage and was thus  dishonest  ..."and
    at paragraph 35 saying she was not a "serial offender"  that  was  with
    "one exception".

9.   I cannot accept Mr  Dhanji's  submission  that  the  judge  effectively
    decided the first claimant did not actually fall under paragraph 322(5)
    because he did not think that was justified on a  discretionary  basis.
    At paragraph 28 the judge said  "I  cannot  exercise  the  respondent's
    discretion".  That is not only a clear statement that the judge did not
    exercise the discretion but a clear demonstration that the judge failed
    to understand that, having found the first claimant had been dishonest,
    it remained incumbent on him  to  decide  whether  to  apply  paragraph
    322(5) as this provision incorporates a discretion.  Nor can  I  accept
    Mr  Dhanji's  suggestion  that  somehow  the  judge's   assessment   of
    proportionality  doubles  as  an  exercise  of  the  paragraph   322(5)
    discretion in favour of the first claimant.  For if that were the  case
    the judge's assessment of proportionality would have had to make  clear
    that the first claimant could be taken to have met the requirements  of
    the Rules, thereby reducing the weight of  the  public  interest.   The
    judge's conclusion at paragraph 37 that:

         "... looking at matters in the round I find that  this  is  a  rare
         case where the private lives of the  [claimants]  and  their  child
         outweigh the public interest in their removal"

    gives no clue as to any position taken as regards conformity  with  the
    Rules.

10.  I consider that the judge's assessment was therefore vitiated by  legal
    error necessitating that I set aside his decision.

11.  Both representatives urged that if I set aside the judge's  decision  I
    should remit it to the FtT.  I  am  unable  to  agree.   There  was  no
    challenge made by the SSHD to the judge's findings of  fact.   Nor  did
    the claimant's responses to the decision of the FtT  judge  to  dispute
    any of the judge's findings of  fact.  As  Mr  Dhanji  conceded,  those
    findings included that  the  first  claimant  had  used  dishonesty  in
    undercharging earnings in the tax year 2010/2011 by over  �25,000.   In
    order for me to re-make the decision, all that is required now is for a
    fresh judicial evaluation of  the  undisputed  facts.   The  claimant's
    representatives have not sought to adduce any further evidence.

12.  As regards the first claimant's case under the Rules,  I  am  satisfied
    firstly that her dishonesty in relation to her 2010/11 tax  return  was
    conduct falling within the  terms  of  paragraph  322(5).   Further,  I
    consider that the SSHD was fully entitled to exercise his discretion by
    concluding that paragraph 322(5) was to be applied as a general  ground
    of refusal.  The amount involved was  considerable.   Even  though  the
    first claimant took steps to repay this amount, this was only done as a
    result of the UKVI questionnaire, which required such information to be
    provided and when it was essential  to  the  first  claimant's  current
    application for leave to remain that she could show she had taken steps
    to rectify matters.  I accept that this was  the  only  time  she  used
    dishonesty and that since 2008 she had established two  businesses  and
    also been employed.  However, none  of  these  or  other  circumstances
    relating to her personal, professional  and  family  life  lead  me  to
    consider  that  the  paragraph  322(5)  discretion  should  have   been
    exercised differently than it was by the SSHD.

13.  Given that the claimants were unable to meet the  requirements  of  the
    Rules, they can only succeed in their appeals  if  able  to  show  that
    there exist compelling circumstances  for  allowing  their  appeals  on
    Article 8 grounds outside the Rules.

14.  In favour of the claimants are the factors I  have  already  mentioned,
    together with other matters set out by the judge at paragraphs  31  and
    36:

         "31. On the other hand a strong private life has  been  established
             in the UK in the expectation on the part  of  both  Appellants
             that they would be granted indefinite leave  to  remain  after
             the first Appellant had accrued 10 years lawful residence.


         ...


         36.   The  financial  evidence  submitted  at  the  time  of   both
             applications showed that the first Appellant  was  earning  in
             excess of �40,000 per annum thus indicating that she was  able
             to meet the minimum  income  requirement  of  Appendix  FM  in
             respect of both her husband and her child."

15.   However,  I  do  not  consider  that  these  circumstances  constitute
    compelling circumstances as they  are  significantly  outweighed  by  a
    number of factors: that both claimants are highly qualified people  who
    would have no difficulty in obtaining work in Pakistan and so would  be
    able to maintain themselves to a satisfactory standard; that the second
    claimant has qualifications in banking; that  the  couple  have  family
    living in Pakistan; that whilst they have resided continuously  in  the
    UK since 2006 and done so at all times resided lawfully (see  paragraph
    2), neither has ever had any expectation that they would be entitled to
    ILR and have only ever been in  receipt  of  limited  leave  under  the
    student and Tier 1 (General Migrant) scheme - and accordingly I  attach
    little weight to their private life.  The couple's child, being born in
    July 2015, is still a very young child and  there  is  nothing  in  the
    evidence to indicate that his best interests lie anywhere else than  in
    returning with his parents, wherever they are allowed to live.

16.  To this point the factors I have identified  as  counting  against  the
    claimants are virtually the same as those weighed against them  by  the
    FtT Judge (see paragraphs 30 and  33).   However  there  is  a  further
    factor, namely the fact that the reason why  the  claimants  could  not
    meet the requirements of the Rules was because  of  dishonesty  on  the
    part of the first claimant involving some �25,000.   Failure  based  on
    such conduct means that very considerable weight has to be attached  to
    the public interest (in the claimants' case  this  involves  more  than
    what the FtT Judge at paragraph 37 described as "the public interest in
    immigration control").  In addition, I note that there were  no  health
    problems  claimed  by  either  claimant.   Taking  into   account   the
    claimants' failure to meet the Rules  and  the  particular  reason  for
    this, I am satisfied that the decision of the SSHD to refuse  leave  to
    remain did not amount  to  a  disproportionate  interference  with  the
    claimants'  private  and  family  lives.   Accordingly  I  dismiss  the
    claimants' appeals.

17.  To conclude:

    The decision of the FtT Judge has been set aside for material error  of
    law.


    The decision I re-make is to dismiss the claimants' appeals.

No anonymity direction is made.
