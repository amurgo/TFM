Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Greer
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of Bhutan. They appealed against a decision
    of the Entry Clearance Officer dated 13 September  2018  refusing  them
    entry clearance to United Kingdom as the wife and daughter of  Mr  Sisr
    [H], the sponsor. The First-tier Tribunal, in a decision promulgated on
    6 June 2019, dismissed the appeal.  The  appellants  now  appeal,  with
    permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Mr Diwnycz, who appeared for the Entry  Clearance  Officer  before  the
    Upper Tribunal, told me that respondent accepted  that  the  judge  had
    before him in the papers provided by the appellant a copy  of  relevant
    English language test results. Moreover, it was clear from  the  papers
    that the sponsor is a refugee who is unable to enjoy family  life  with
    the appellants in Bhutan. Mr Diwnycz said that the First-tier Tribunal,
    had it considered  the  relevant  evidence,  should  have  allowed  the
    appeal.

 3. I agree. I am aware that this was a paper case but it is apparent  that
    the judge has overlooked evidence which should have led  him  to  allow
    the appeal.



Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside. I have remade the
    decision. The appeal of the appellants  against  the  decision  of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer dated 13 September 2018  is  allowed  on  human
    rights grounds (Article 8 ECHR).
