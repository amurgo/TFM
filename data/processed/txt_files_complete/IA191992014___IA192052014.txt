                                   Before

                    DEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE MCWILLIAM

                                   Between

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                             Mrs Kulwinder Kaur
                               Mr Sumeet Singh
                       (anonymity directionS not made)
                                                                 Respondents


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr J Trussler, Counsel


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The respondents are both citizens of India  and  are  married  to  each
    other. Mrs Kaur's date of birth is 1 September 1988 and Mr Singh's date
    of birth is 12 September 1987.  I shall refer  to  the  respondents  as
    appellants as they were before the First-tier Tribunal. I  shall  refer
    to Mrs Kaur as the appellant.

2.   The appellant made an application on 20 March 2014 for leave to  remain
    as a Tier 4 Student Migrant and her  husband  made  an  application  to
    remain as her dependant.   The  appellant  and  her  husband  had  been
    granted leave to enter the UK on 23 March 2012 (the appellant as a Tier
    4 (General) Student Migrant and her husband  as  a  dependant).   Their
    leave expired on 30 March 2014.

3.   The application was refused by the Secretary of State in a decision  of
    10 April 2014 on maintenance grounds.  It was noted by the Secretary of
    State that the appellant needed to establish that she had �3,200 for  a
    consecutive 28 day period.  The decision-maker was satisfied that there
    was �1,200 available to Mr Singh and that the appellant needed to  show
    that she had a further �2,000 available to her.   The  bank  statements
    that had been submitted by the appellant showed that she fell short  of
    the funds throughout the relevant period.

4.   The appellant appealed and the appeal  was  allowed  by  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Bircher in a determination that was promulgated  on
    14 July 2013.  The decision was determined on the papers at the request
    of the appellant.

5.   The Judge allowed the  appeal  having  taken  into  consideration  bank
    statements provided by the appellant that he described as  having  been
    "subsequently" provided and that these statements established that  the
    appellant met the maintenance requirements of the Rules.  Permission to
    appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Colyer  on  4  August
    2014.

6.   The grounds seeking permission  to  appeal  assert  that  the  evidence
    relied upon by the Judge was not admissible pursuant to Section 85A  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The bank  statements
    relied  on  by  the  Judge  had  been  submitted  post-  date  of   the
    application.

7.   Mr Trussler indicated to me that he had been  instructed  late  in  the
    day and that there was a problem which he  and  Mr  Wilding  could  not
    resolve namely whether the statement relied upon by the Judge described
    as having been provided "subsequently" was produced post  the  date  of
    the application date but pre the date of the decision or post the  date
    of the decision.  There was a discussion at  the  hearing  and  it  was
    agreed by the parties that the document that the Judge relied on was  a
    bank statement ending in the digits 2968 which was on  the  court  file
    and which was printed out on 16 April 2014, which was after the date of
    the decision.  In these circumstances Mr Trussler conceded that he  was
    in some difficulty as it was obvious that the bank statement  on  which
    the Judge relied was submitted post the date of the decision.

8.   The Judge in my view materially erred in  law  in  admitting  the  bank
    statement and allowing the appeal on the basis of this post-application
    evidence.  I  set  aside  the  decision  under  the  Immigration  Rules
    pursuant to Section 12(2)(a) of the 2007 Act.  It is clear that on  the
    evidence that was submitted with  the  application  the  appellant  was
    unable to satisfy  the  maintenance  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

9.   Mr Trussler asked for an adjournment in order to prepare for a  further
    hearing because he had been instructed late in the day.  I refused  the
    application having considered the overriding objective in Rule 2 of the
    Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  in  the  light  of  the
    directions that had been issued to the parties confirming  that  should
    there be an error of law that was such that the decision  will  be  set
    aside the Upper Tribunal would go on to  remake  the  decision  at  the
    hearing on 30 October.

10.  I remake the decision and dismiss the appeal under the  Rules  pursuant
    to Section 12(2)(b)(ii).

11.     Article 8 of the 1950 Convention on Human Rights was not  raised  by
    the appellant in the grounds of appeal before the First-tier  Tribunal.
    Indeed, there was no  witness  statement  from  the  appellant  or  her
    husband before the First-tier Tribunal and there had been no service of
    evidence in accordance with the directions of the Upper  Tribunal.   It
    is clear that the appellant was granted leave on 23  February  2012  in
    order to study in the UK and that  leave  expired  on  30  March  2014.
    There is insufficient evidence to establish that the appellant and  her
    husband have  in  the  UK  any  private  life  that  would  engage  the
    Convention, and in these  circumstances  I  dismiss  the  appeal  under
    Article 8. There was no ground of appeal before the First-tier Tribunal
    relating to paragraph 245AA of the Rules and  this  was  not  an  issue
    raised by Mr Trussler. In any event,  on  the  basis  of  the  evidence
    before me, it is clear that it does not apply in this case  which  does
    not involve missing documents in a sequence.

12.    The appeal is dismissed under the Rules and Article 8.
