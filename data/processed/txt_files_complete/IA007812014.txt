                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Othieno, Apex Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nepal who applied for leave to remain  in
    the United Kingdom as a Tier 4  (General)  Student  Migrant  under  the
    Points Based System.  It was refused by the respondent  in  a  decision
    dated 10 December 2013.

 2. In her decision the Secretary of State set out  that  grants  of  entry
    clearance or leave to remain for Tier 4 applicants to undertake studies
    at degree level or above had to be limited to a maximum period of  five
    years (60 months).  There were exceptions for  that  but  none  of  the
    exceptions  are  said  to  have  applied  in  the   appellant's   case.
    Accordingly the issue before the judge was whether  the  appellant  had
    completed courses of study which  together  with  her  proposed  course
    would exceed five years.  The judge did not approach the appeal in this
    way and appears to have focused  on  whether  until  19  May  2009  the
    appellant had studied courses below degree level the duration of  which
    added together exceeded three years.

 3. There was a considerable amount of confusion  as  to  what  was  degree
    level or above but it appears to have been settled in written  material
    that was provided to the judge after the hearing, and which  the  judge
    agreed to take into account that,  the  definitions  are  to  be  found
    within the Immigration Rules.

 4. Paragraph 6 of the Immigration Rules provides that degree  level  study
    means a course which leads to a recognised  United  Kingdom  degree  at
    Bachelors level or above or an equivalent qualification at level  6  or
    above  of  the  revised  National   Qualifications   Framework   (NQF).
    Similarly under paragraph 8 of the Rules postgraduate level study means
    a course at level 7 or above of  the  revised  NQF  which  leads  to  a
    recognised UK postgraduate degree at  Masters  level  or  above  or  an
    equivalent qualification at the same level.  Thus in  order  to  assess
    whether the appellant was studying at degree level or above the courses
    had to be assessed by reference to whether the courses she was pursuing
    were at level 6 or level 7.

 5. The history of the appellant's studies does not seem to be in doubt and
    is recorded in the determination by the judge.  The relevant periods of
    level 6 or above are found in paragraph 6, paragraph  9  and  paragraph
    11.  Paragraph 6 deals with a course which was to  have  commenced  and
    did in fact commence on 17 April 2006 and was due to end  on  28  April
    2009.  It was a course which we have seen by reference to a letter  was
    for a BSc in Computer and Information Systems at level  6.   It  was  a
    three year course and was in my judgment without doubt a  degree  level
    course.  The fact that the college  folded  only  at  a  stage  halfway
    through the course (which meant that the appellant was only able to  be
    awarded a diploma) does not affect the course  that  she  was  studying
    because it was at all times a degree level course at level 6 or above.

 6. She then went on to study for a period between  11  June  2007  and  18
    January 2008 at Middlesex College.  There again,  that  was  a  BSc  in
    Computer and Information Systems and was at level 6.  That college  too
    folded but, for the reasons  I  have  already  stated,  that  does  not
    matter.  She did not receive a recognised  qualification  at  all  from
    those courses of study but that does not mean she was not studying at a
    degree level course.  Indeed, to reduce the argument to  absurdity,  if
    an individual fails in  her  achievements  while  studying,  it  cannot
    properly be said that, as a result, she was not studying at all.

 7. However, the evidence establishes that she was pursuing a degree  level
    course for a period between 17 April 2006 and 18 January 2008, a period
    of about 21 months.  It is conceded that between 1 February 2010 and 29
    July 2011 she was studying at Kaplan Financial at level 7.  Level 7  is
    postgraduate  level.   Accordingly  there  was  a  further  period   of
    something like 18 months when the appellant was involved in studies  at
    degree level or above, making 39 months in total to July  2011.   There
    was a final period recorded in paragraph 11 of the determination  which
    set out that between 18 November 2013 and to date she has been studying
    at the City of London Academy at  a  level  7  BTEC  extended  diploma.
    Level 7 is classified as postgraduate.  This course is due to end on 27
    February 2015, a further 15-month period of post-graduate study.

 8. The courses to which the Judge referred in paragraphs 6, 9 and 11 total
    something like 54 months.

 9. I adjourned the hearing on 16 July 2014 because, at paragraph 8 of  the
    determination, the appellant told the Judge that there  was  a  further
    period of study at Kaplan Financial between 28 January 2008 and 19  May
    2009 when she was studying at levels 5 and 6.  It follows that  if  the
    period she was studying at level 6 exceeded  six  months,  her  present
    course would exceed the  permitted  60  month  period.   I  gave  these
    directions, amongst others:

         The resumed hearing is limited to a consideration  of  whether,  in
         the period between 28 January 2008 and 19 May 2009,  the  appellant
         was studying at Kaplan  Financial  at  level  5  or  6  whilst  she
         followed a  course  with  the  Chartered  Institute  of  Management
         Accountants and, if at level 6, the period of study at that level.

10. By letter dated  29  August  2014,  Kaplan  Financial  wrote  that  the
    appellant and studied a CIMA course at the following levels:

         28 January 2008 to 20 May 2008 at level 4;

         29 July 2008 to 25 November 2008 at levels 4 and 5;

         27 January 2009 to 19 May 2009 at level 5.

11. All of these courses are at below degree  level,  notwithstanding  what
    the appellant told  the  Judge  as  recorded  in  paragraph  8  of  the
    determination.

12. I found that the judge made material error on a point of law in failing
    to approach the case  in  the  way  that  I  have  outlined  above  and
    therefore did not properly consider whether the courses of study  which
    the  appellant  has  been  embarked  upon  were  in  violation  of  the
    limitation placed upon her that she should not be involved  in  studies
    at degree level or above for a period that did not exceed five years.

13. In re-making the decision, the appellant is entitled to a finding  that
    she had completed courses of study which  together  with  her  proposed
    course would not exceed five years.  The  reason  put  forward  by  the
    respondent for refusing the application is not made out.   Accordingly,
    the appellant's appeal is allowed.  The effect of this decision  is  to
    sanction the course of studies for a BTEC  extended  diploma  that  the
    appellant is now pursuing which is due to finish on 27 February 2015.

DECISION

               1) The First-tier Tribunal Judge made an error on a point  of
                  law and his decision is set aside.

               2) I re-make the decision  allowing  the  appellant's  appeal
                  against the decision  that  the  course  proposed  by  the
                  appellant would exceed 5  years  of  post-graduate  study,
                  taken together with her previous periods of  post-graduate
                  study.

               3) The appellant met the requirements for  further  leave  to
                  remain in relation to the course proposed by the appellant
                  which is due to end on 27 February 2015.
