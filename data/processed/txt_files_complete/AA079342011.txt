                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. This appeal came before me again on 21 August 2013. On 11 March 2013
       I gave the following directions:

        1.    By a decision dated 8 May 2012  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Craig
           found that there was an error of law  in  the  decision  of  the
           First-tier Tribunal in relation to Article 8 ECHR such that  the
           decision was set aside to be re-made by the Upper Tribunal.


        2. Subsequent to that decision, the appellant has  been  granted  a
           residence card under the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
           Regulations 2006, as the family member of an EEA national.


        3. The provisional view of the Upper Tribunal is that the  granting
           of a residence card does not constitute  leave  to  remain  such
           that the appeal before the Upper Tribunal falls to be  abandoned
           under section 104(4A) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
           Act  2002,  the  residence   card   merely   being   documentary
           confirmation of his right to reside in the UK.


        4. It is also the provisional view of the Upper Tribunal that in re-
           making the decision the appeal should be allowed under Article 8
           ECHR on the basis that the respondent's decision  could  not  be
           said  to  pursue  a  legitimate  aim,   alternatively   is   not
           proportionate, in circumstances where it is  accepted  that  the
           appellant has the right to reside in the UK as the family member
           of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights.


        5. If either party disagrees with the views expressed in paragraphs
           3 or 4 above, that party must notify the Tribunal of its reasons
           for disagreement no later than 14 days from the  date  on  which
           these directions are sent out. After the expiry of that time the
           Upper  Tribunal  will,  after  taking  into  account  any  views
           expressed by the  parties,  decide  how  the  appeal  is  to  be
           disposed of, without further reference to the parties.


        6. The parties are to note again, as indicated at the hearing on 21
           January 2013,  that  in  any  determination  of  this  appeal  a
           decision may be made on the issue of the removal decision  under
           section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality  Act  2006
           having been incorporated in the decision to refuse to vary leave
           to remain, following the decisions in Ahmadi  (s.  47  decision:
           validity; Sapkota) [2012] UKUT  00147  (IAC)  and  Adamally  and
           Jaferi  (section  47  removal  decisions:  Tribunal  Procedures)
           [2012] UKUT 00414 (IAC).


    2. No response from the Secretary of State has been received  to  those
       directions. On 13 August 2013 the appellant's representatives  wrote
       to the Tribunal referring to a reply to the directions  having  been
       sent on 18 April 2013, a copy of which is on the Tribunal file.  The
       letters  confirm  that  the  appellant's  representatives   are   in
       agreement with the proposals made in  paragraphs  3  and  4  of  the
       Directions.

    3. In the circumstances, it is appropriate to determine the  appeal  in
       the manner indicated in paragraph 4. The appeal is therefore allowed
       under  Article  8  of  the  ECHR.  That  decision   supersedes   any
       consideration of the lawfulness of the removal  decision,  which  on
       the basis of the authorities referred  to  in  paragraph  6  of  the
       directions is not a lawful decision.




Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek                                     22/08/12
