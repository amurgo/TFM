For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola (Home Office Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of OO, a citizen of Nigeria  born  22  June  1987,
       against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of  12  January  2018
       dismissing her appeal on asylum grounds, itself brought  against  the
       refusal of her asylum claim on 9 June 2017.


    2. The immigration history supplied by the Secretary of State  was  that
       she arrived in the UK as a student on 6 January 2010, her leave being
       extended to 3 February 2014. She was encountered  during  enforcement
       activity and detained on 4 May 2017. She claimed  asylum  on  15  May
       2017.

    3. Her asylum claim, which I summarise from the evidence set out in  the
       decision below, was based on her gender preference. She was gay. This
       first caused her difficulties at home when she was caught  kissing  a
       girlfriend, OT, during a sleepover at her  family  home.  Her  family
       took objection to this, and she was beaten by her uncle and his wife,
       and subjected to a "deliverance" session by her uncle at church.  Her
       father sent her to the UK to avoid further violence.

    4. In the UK she had had a couple of relationships until  the  death  of
       her parents in a car crash in February 2013 caused her to  completely
       shut down emotionally. She had registered with some dating  websites,
       though she was vague as to the LGBT websites and  magazines  she  had
       viewed. Most of her friends were from the Nigerian community and  she
       had hidden her sexuality from them. There was strong  disapproval  of
       gay relationships within that society and she feared  being  reported
       and arrested under Nigerian law. She was scared  of  coming  out:  "I
       read the bible, I go to church, one leg in one leg  out".  She  would
       hide her sexuality on a return to Nigeria.  The  last  time  she  had
       spoken to her father he had told her not to pursue her sexuality.

    5. She also feared persecution for political reasons having been on  two
       pro-Biafra demonstrations before 2013 whilst in the UK.

    6. When arrested, a Minute Sheet from 4 May 2017 recorded that  she  had
       stated she had a British boyfriend and lived in his accommodation.

    7. A Rule 35 report from Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre recorded
       that the scars she bore on her anterior abdomen were in keeping  with
       severe trauma with different objects, and thus  consistent  with  her
       having suffered a severe and random battering at  some  time  in  the
       past.

    8. Her asylum application was refused by the Secretary of State  as  her
       account  was  not  accepted   as   credible,   given   the   internal
       inconsistencies combined with her delay in claiming asylum.

    9. Her aunt Mrs A gave evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal,  saying
       she had been contacted by the Appellant's mother before  she  arrived
       here and asked to  look  after  her,  following  a  scandal  back  in
       Nigeria. The Appellant had told her she had been beaten but Mrs A had
       preferred not to look into  this  for  herself.  Family  members  had
       stopped speaking to her since she had taken  the  Appellant  in.  The
       Appellant's family would not support her if she returned to Nigeria.

   10.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  noted  that  the  Home   Office   Country
       Information and Guidance on Nigeria from March 2015  which  indicated
       that  same  sex  relationships  were  criminalised,  that  homophobic
       attitudes were widely held, that there would  be  unlikely  to  be  a
       sufficiency of protection against a real risk of  serious  harm,  and
       that internal relocation would not be possible if a person feared the
       state, but societal actors might be avoided by  moving  elsewhere  to
       parts of Lagos  and  Abuna  where  homophobia  was  less  pronounced.
       Internal relocation would not be reasonable if it required  a  person
       to conceal their sexual orientation.

   11. The Tribunal had some concerns as to the Appellant's credibility.  It
       was not credible that she was unaware of the possibility of  claiming
       asylum given she was an educated woman who had mixed with  other  gay
       women. She gave  a  false  address  when  arrested,  which  might  be
       understandable given the inevitable panic she would have felt at  the
       time, but additionally she had referred to having a British boyfriend
       as at May 2015 and there was a suggestion  elsewhere  in  the  papers
       that she was in a relationship with a  man  when  arrested  in  2017.
       Nevertheless the Judge accepted that  she  had  clearly  been  deeply
       affected by the death of her parents.

   12. Having regard to the evidence as a  whole,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       accepted  that  the  Appellant  had  had  at   least   one   same-sex
       relationship in Nigeria. The Rule 35 evidence corroborated her  claim
       to have been mistreated by her family and it accepted  she  had  been
       sent here by her father to study and to  avoid  further  mistreatment
       from her uncle. She was certainly perceived to be gay by her family.

   13. Applying the law to those findings of fact,  the  Tribunal  concluded
       that, given the country evidence before it, if  the  Appellant  lived
       openly as a gay person in Nigeria she  would  face  a  real  risk  of
       persecution. It was then necessary to  determine  whether  she  would
       live openly. It could be anticipated that if she returned there  then
       she would hide her sexuality, as she had done in the UK. She had  not
       had a same-sex relationship for  almost  five  years  in  the  UK,  a
       country where homosexuality was legal and tolerated.  It  was  highly
       likely she would act similarly  on  a  return  to  Nigeria.  She  was
       conflicted about her sexuality, as shown by  her  evidence  regarding
       her father's disapproval of her relationship, and as to the influence
       of the church and community upon her. Thus she fell into the category
       identified by Lord Rodger at �82 of HJ (Iran): she was a  person  who
       would on return foreseeably choose a way of life which would not lead
       to her being liable to be persecuted because she was gay.

   14. On a return to Nigeria she could live apart from her family  members.
       State protection would not be available to her, but it would  not  be
       unduly harsh to expect her to relocate internally. She  had  obtained
       an accountancy qualification in the UK and was used to  living  in  a
       large city, having lived and obtained work experience in London.

   15. There was no evidence that the Nigerian authorities would have become
       aware of her participation in demonstrations. As to her  private  and
       family life, she was educated and resourceful and the public interest
       identified by section 117B as  to  the  relevance  of  precariousness
       counted strongly against her given her failure to try  to  regularise
       her position sooner.

   16. Accordingly, as she had failed to demonstrate that she faced a  well-
       founded fear of persecution on return or  that  her  expulsion  would
       represent a disproportionate interference with her private and family
       life, her appeal was dismissed on asylum and human rights grounds.

   17. Grounds of appeal of January 2018 argued that the First-tier Tribunal
       erred in law in finding that

      a) State protection would not be available to the Appellant whilst
         not accepting she would be at real risk of persecution;



      b) The risks she faced were localised to simply two family members,
         given that there was every chance of her sexuality being revealed
         by family members given their knowledge of it;



      c) Failing to apply HJ (Iran) given that the Appellant's evidence was
         that she had not pursued same-sex relationships in the UK because
         of her emotional state following her parents' death;



      d) Failing to consider relevant considerations in assessing the undue
         harshness of relocation, in that she would lack family and thus
         financial or emotional support, and had not completed her degree.


   18. Although the First-tier Tribunal refused permission to  appeal  on  6
       February 2018, the Upper Tribunal granted permission to appeal on  30
       May 2018, on the basis that  the  Tribunal  had  failed  to  consider
       whether any part of the Appellant's  motivation  for  concealing  her
       sexuality on a return to Nigeria was driven by a fear of persecution.




   19. Shortly before the hearing, the Appellant's representatives wrote  to
       the  Tribunal  stating  that  she  was   unable   to   afford   legal
       representation  and  accordingly  requesting  that  her   appeal   be
       determined on the papers. I considered this  application.  An  appeal
       may proceed without a hearing in the Upper Tribunal: see Rule  34(1).
       However, before an appeal is so treated, the views of  any  party  to
       the appeal  must  be  expressly  considered  (Rule  34(2)).  For  the
       Secretary of State, Mr Kandola expressed a  wish  to  participate  in
       proceedings. Given the hearing had been listed for some time and  the
       application was made at short notice, I considered it appropriate  in
       the interests of justice to permit Mr Kandola to defend  the  appeal.
       Given that he essentially limited himself to arguing that the  First-
       tier Tribunal's reasoning process was lawful, the Appellant  suffered
       no prejudice by way of  unexpected  arguments  or  submissions  being
       raised.

   20. Mr Kandola submitted that the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  come  to  a
       perfectly  rational  determination  of  the  appeal.  The  Judge  had
       essentially found that the  Appellant  was  grappling  with  her  own
       sexuality and for those reasons had not lived openly. Thus she  would
       not be required to suppress her identity  on  a  return  to  Nigeria.
       There was evidence from which the inference could reasonably be drawn
       that the Appellant had  acted  discreetly  in  recent  years  through
       lifestyle choice. Such a  finding  was  open  to  a  Judge  directing
       themselves in accordance with HJ (Iran).

Findings and reasons

   21. The country information before the First-tier Tribunal  included  the
       following:


           "Country Information and Guidance - Nigeria: Sexual orientation
           and gender identity (March 2015)
           ...
           1.3.6 Same-sex sexual relations between men are criminalized
           under the criminal code, while 12 northern states have adopted
           Islamic Sharia laws criminalising same-sex sexual activities for
           both men and women. In January 2014, President Goodluck Jonathan
           enacted the Same-Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act 2013, which
           criminalizes same-sex marriage, the 'public show of same sex
           amorous relationship[s]' and prohibits the registration and
           operation for LGBT support groups.
           ...
           1.3.8 Nigeria is a religiously and culturally conservative
           country where homophobic attitudes - which is likely to include
           those who do not conform to gender norms, i.e. transgender
           persons - are widely held. In a survey conducted in 2013, 98% of
           Nigerians stated that they believe 'homosexuality' should not be
           accepted by society, while state and media rhetoric is anti-
           LGBT.
           1.3.9 LGBT persons have experienced societal discrimination and
           violence, including incidents of mob attacks, intimidation and
           harassment, blackmail and extortion. Societal violence is likely
           to be underreported. LGBT persons have also experienced loss of
           accommodation and jobs, and been denied access to health
           services, with several sources reporting an increase following
           the enactment of the Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act.
           ...
           1.3.12 With the existence of anti-LGBT legislation and
           widespread societal discrimination, the accumulation of measures
           that affect a LGBT person may be sufficiently serious by their
           nature and repetition in individual cases to constitute a severe
           violation of basic human rights and amount to persecution.
           Decision makers must ensure that they take into account the
           latest country information, and consider each case on its facts
           taking account of the person's past experience of any ill-
           treatment.
           ...
           Are those at risk able to seek effective protection?
           1.3.13 Same sex sexual acts are criminalised in Nigeria, while
           some elements within the police have harassed and used violence
           against LGBT persons. The state cannot be considered willing or
           able to provide effective protection to LGBT persons.
           Are those at risk able to internally relocate within Nigeria to
           escape that risk?
           1.3.14 Where the threat is from the state, internal relocation
           is not a viable option.
           1.3.15 Where LGBT persons encounter hostility from societal
           actors they may be able to avoid this by moving elsewhere in
           Nigeria, but only if the risk is not present there and it is
           would not be unduly harsh to expect them to do so. Homophobic
           attitudes are widespread across Nigerian society. However, in
           parts of the Lagos and Abuja homophobia is less pronounced. The
           onus is on the applicant to demonstrate why they believe they
           cannot relocate within or to these cities to avoid persecution
           from non-state actors. However, internal relocation cannot be
           relied on if it depends on the person concealing their sexual
           orientation in the proposed new location for fear of
           persecution."

   22. It seems to me that the findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  were
       properly open to it on the available evidence. Lord Rodger stated  in
       HJ (Iran) [2010] UKSC 31 �81:


           "If the applicant would in  fact  live  openly  and  thereby  be
           exposed to a real risk of  persecution,  then  he  has  a  well-
           founded fear of persecution - even if he could avoid the risk by
           living 'discreetly'.
           If, on the other hand, the tribunal concludes that the applicant
           would in fact live discreetly and so avoid persecution, it  must
           go on to ask itself why he would do so.
           If the tribunal concludes that the  applicant  would  choose  to
           live discreetly simply because that was  how  he  himself  would
           wish to live, or because of social pressures, e.g., not  wanting
           to distress his parents  or  embarrass  his  friends,  then  his
           application should be rejected. Social pressures of that kind do
           not amount to persecution and  the  Convention  does  not  offer
           protection against them. Such a person has no well-founded  fear
           of persecution because, for reasons that have nothing to do with
           any fear of persecution, he himself chooses to adopt  a  way  of
           life which means that he is not in fact liable to be  persecuted
           because he is gay.
           If, on the other hand, the tribunal concludes  that  a  material
           reason for the applicant living discreetly on his  return  would
           be a fear of the persecution which would follow if  he  were  to
           live openly as a gay man, then, other things  being  equal,  his
           application should be accepted. Such a person has a well-founded
           fear of persecution. To reject his  application  on  the  ground
           that he could avoid the persecution by living  discreetly  would
           be to defeat the very  right  which  the  Convention  exists  to
           protect - his right to live freely  and  openly  as  a  gay  man
           without fear of persecution. By  admitting  him  to  asylum  and
           allowing him to live freely and openly as a gay man without fear
           of persecution, the receiving state gives effect to  that  right
           by affording the applicant a surrogate for the  protection  from
           persecution  which  his  country  of  nationality  should   have
           afforded him."


   23. The penultimate paragraph of that passage  demonstrates  that  it  is
       open to a decision maker, in the appropriate case,  to  find  that  a
       person will foreseeably act discreetly on a return to  their  country
       of origin for reasons other than a fear of persecution.


   24. In this appeal the Judge had evidence before them that the  Appellant
       had not pursued a same-sex relationship  for  some  five  years.  Her
       emotional  state  had  precluded  them.  She  may   well   have   had
       heterosexual relationships; at least that is what she is recorded  as
       having told the immigration authorities. The Judge drew the inference
       that if this was how she chose to live her life in the UK,  it  could
       reasonably be predicted that she would continue to do so in Nigeria.

   25. The Judge accepted that she  might  be  at  risk  from  those  family
       members with whom  she  had  previously  lived.  However,  the  Judge
       concluded that she could pursue internal  relocation  to  avoid  harm
       from her close family members to a large urban area where  she  could
       live anonymously.

   26. It seems to me that these findings were open to the Judge. There  was
       evidence (see e.g. the Home Office reference to Lagos  and  Abuja  at
       1.3.15 of the Guidance cited above) to support the  conclusion  that,
       in one of the more cosmopolitan areas of urban Nigeria, the Appellant
       would not face persecution were she to express the full span  of  her
       sexual  identity  and  continue  to   involve   herself   in   sexual
       relationships. And thus if she chose not to do so, her reasons for so
       doing would not be driven by any fear of persecution. Accordingly the
       observation of the Upper Tribunal, that it was necessary to  consider
       whether any material element of her motivation  for  so  behaving  in
       future was attributable to a real risk of persecution, does not  lead
       to the appeal's success.

   27. As to the other grounds of appeal, there is no inconsistency  between
       the findings on the absence of state protection and  the  possibility
       of the Appellant facing a real risk of serious harm.  The  First-tier
       Tribunal clearly accepted that she might face harm in her  home  area
       but nevertheless concluded that she could  reasonably  locate  to  an
       urban centre. That is perfectly consistent with  the  effect  of  the
       country evidence cited by the Home Office  Guidance,  which  is  that
       state protection will not be available to ameliorate a  genuine  risk
       of persecution, but that such a risk may be abated by  departing  the
       area where non-state actors pose a danger. In  an  urban  environment
       such as Lagos there would be no real risk of her sexuality's exposure
       to the broader community by her family members.  Indeed,  as  I  have
       already noted, it would seem that even were her sexuality so exposed,
       she would not face  pronounced  homophobia  in  those  parts  of  the
       country.

   28. Contrary to the suggestion  in  the  grounds  of  appeal,  there  was
       evidence of motivations for discretion  beyond  her  emotional  state
       following her loss of her parents, such as her conflicted status  and
       her pursuit of heterosexual relationships over an extended period  in
       the UK. It was not unreasonable for the Tribunal  to  find  that  she
       would be able to use the advantages she had obtained from studying in
       the UK to help assimilate in a new city in her country of origin.

   29. I accordingly find that the findings of the First-tier Tribunal  were
       properly open to it, and that there is no material error  of  law  in
       its decision.

Decision:

    The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
