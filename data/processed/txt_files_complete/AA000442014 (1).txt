For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Bartram, Counsel instructed by Migrant Law
Partnership
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent to this appeal, hereinafter "the claimant", is a Turkish
    national born in 1995.  It follows that although he  has  achieved  his
    majority he is only 19 years old and he is an asylum  seeker.   In  the
    circumstances I make an anonymity direction pursuant to Rule 14 of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  Unless and  until  the
    Tribunal or court directs otherwise the claimant is granted  anonymity.
    No part of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify  him
    or any member of his family and failure to comply with these directions
    could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 2. The claimant's appeal against a decision to remove him from the  United
    Kingdom was allowed by the First-tier Tribunal on the grounds that  the
    claimant is a refugee.  This decision is challenged by  the  appellant,
    hereinafter "the Secretary of State", who maintains, in  summary,  that
    the First-tier Tribunal's decision was reasoned inadequately.

 3. In order to understand the determination I  begin  by  considering  the
    detailed Reasons for Refusal Letter dated 19 April 2011 prepared by the
    Secretary of State.

 4. This noted, directly, that the claimant sought asylum because he feared
    mistreatment due to his race  and/or  political  opinions  and  claimed
    humanitarian protection because he feared that  in  the  event  of  his
    return he would risk unlawful killing, torture or inhuman or  degrading
    treatment or punishment.

 5. In his screening interview he identified himself as a Turkish  national
    of Kurdish ethnicity.  He said his father is a  farmer  that  had  been
    "missing" since October 2010.  His mother is a housewife and farmer and
    lived in the claimant's home village with his brothers and sisters.

 6. The claimant said that he became a member of the DTP in  2008  and  the
    BDP in 2010.  His father had been a member of the BDP.

 7. He claimed to have been detained in Turkey on three  occasions  because
    of his political involvement.  He was detained by  the  gendarmerie  in
    his village in January 2009, by a gendarmerie special team in  February
    2010 for two days and by the  police  in  Antep  for  two  days  on  25
    December 2010.

 8. He feared the gendarmerie would kill him if he returned.

 9. He said he entered the United Kingdom on a lorry in  January  2011  and
    claimed asylum about two weeks later.

10. The Secretary of State accepted that the claimant is a Turkish national
    of Kurdish ethnicity.

11. According to the Reasons for Refusal Letter the claimant did not make a
    good impression in his interview.  For example he claimed to have  been
    interested in politics firstly in 2008 when he was aged 14  but  if  he
    was in fact born in 1995 as he claimed he would not have been 14  years
    old in 2008.

12. His interest in Kurdish politics was that of all Kurdish  young  people
    who were under pressure from the  gendarmerie.   He  was  not  able  to
    indicate any of the policies advanced by the DTP in 2008  when  he  had
    started to support them.  He said wrongly that Abdullah �calan was  the
    leader of the BDP whereas �calan was the leader of the PKK and Demirtas
    was the leader of the BDP.  He said that the BDP was  founded  in  2009
    whereas it was founded  in  2008  and  that  its  headquarters  are  in
    Elbistan and Kurdistan when the background evidence shows that  it  was
    in Ankara.

13. The claimant said that he knew the DTP had closed in 2009 and  the  BDP
    was then formed but he did not know the reason  for  the  DTP  closing.
    However the background material shows that the DTP was closed by  order
    of the constitutional court in December 2009 and the Secretary of State
    took  the  view  that  even  a  young  person  would  have   had   some
    understanding of the reason behind the closure of the  DTP  if,  as  he
    claimed, he was genuinely interested in Kurdish politics.

14. The Secretary of State was  similarly  unimpressed  by  the  claimant's
    inability  to  remember  the  approximate  date  of  the  most   recent
    presidential elections or even if there were elections at a  time  when
    he supported firstly the DTP and later the BDP.

15. Putting everything together the Secretary of State did not believe that
    the claimant had been involved in any kind  of  political  activity  or
    that his father was "missing" as claimed.

16. At paragraph 23 of the Reasons for  Refusal  Letter  the  Secretary  of
    State explained that she did not believe that  the  claimant  had  been
    detained by the gendarmerie, the gendarmerie special team or the police
    as claimed.  This decision was based on the  general  adverse  findings
    about the claimant's case  and  the  additional  observation  that  the
    claimant had said during his screening interview that he had only  ever
    had his fingerprints taken when he claimed asylum whereas  he  said  on
    another occasion that his identity was  checked  and  his  fingerprints
    were taken on each occasion that he was detained.

17. The Secretary of State found  the  claimant's  evidence  to  have  been
    released on signing a document saying that his family would  be  harmed
    if he did not cooperate with the authorities was not credible.

18. The claimant said that his release from custody  was  assisted  by  his
    maternal uncle paying a bribe.  He said that  his  maternal  uncle  had
    supported the PKK but claimed not to know if his uncle  had  ever  been
    detained for political reasons.  The Secretary of State did not believe
    that claim given that it was the claimant's case that  his  father  had
    discussed political problems with  him  and  his  uncle  lived  in  the
    village.  It was also thought incredible that the police would accept a
    bribe from a PKK activist.

19. The Secretary of State also thought it a discrepancy in the  claimant's
    account that he said that he had promised the police that he  would  be
    an informer for them but it was the gendarmerie that came to his  house
    asking for information.  Neither could the Secretary of State make  any
    sense of the claimant's contention that his uncle had arranged for  him
    to stay in Antep when it was not safe for the claimant to  return  home
    when, according to the claimant, he had only recently been  ill-treated
    by the police in Antep.

20. The Secretary of State did not accept that the claimant had shown  that
    he came within any of the risk categories identified in IA, HC, KD, RO,
    HG (Risk, guidelines, separatist) Turkey  CG  [2003]  UKIAT  00034  and
    there would be no risk associated with his return  because  he  had  no
    political profile.  The Secretary of State noted the guidance given  in
    IK (Returnees - records -  IFA)  Turkey  CG  [2004]  UKIAT  00312,  but
    decided that the claimant's own case did not create  a  risk.   He  had
    never been charged with any offence or that a warrant existed  for  his
    arrest.  It follows, from IK, that the GBTS system would  have  nothing
    recorded against him to attract attention in the event of  his  return.
    In the circumstances there was nothing  to  stop  him  passing  through
    border controls in Turkey and establishing himself away from  his  home
    area if that is what he wanted to do.

21. At paragraph 42 of the refusal letter the  Secretary  of  State  noted,
    again following IK, that although the claimant might attract  attention
    in the event of his being returned on an emergency travel document  and
    there being no record of a lawful departure there was no real  risk  of
    his being ill-treated.  At most there was a risk of an extended  period
    of questioning to establish his circumstance.   Clearly  if  there  was
    anything to hide this could be a dangerous time for  the  claimant  but
    the Secretary of State did not believe there was anything in  his  past
    to be hidden.

22. The Secretary of State saw no reason to grant the claimant humanitarian
    protection or to allow the application  on  human  rights  grounds  for
    other reasons.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  noted  that  the  claimant's
    "further application" had not submitted any evidence to  challenge  the
    refusal letter of 19 April 2011.

23. The First-tier Tribunal Judge noted that the  "central  issue  in  this
    appeal on the lower standard of proof, is  whether  the  [claimant]  is
    perceived by the Turkish authorities to be a supporter of the PKK".

24. The First-tier Tribunal Judge accepted that the  claimant  was  Kurdish
    having heard him name a Kurdish newspaper and three Kurdish  television
    channels as well as recognising Newroz on 21 March as the  Kurdish  New
    Year celebration day.

25. At paragraph 10 of the  determination  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    appears to excuse the inconsistencies in the  account  because  of  the
    claimant's youth.  Rather he found that the claimant was  one  of  many
    youngsters in a Kurdish village who was arrested with others.

26. The judge noted background evidence showing that since 2012  the  armed
    conflict had become worse  and  that  pro-Kurdish  parties,  even  when
    apparently lawful, were regarded as  terrorist  organisations  and  the
    supporters beaten.

27. The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered the country guidance cases and
    decided that in the event of his  return  the  claimant  would  attract
    attention because he would be returned on an emergency document and had
    not left the country lawfully.  Unlike the respondent,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge found the claimant had been detained and would have some
    sort of profile that could come to light  in  the  event  of  enquiries
    being made and this was the basis of the risk which led to his allowing
    the appeal.

28. The grounds complain that the determination does not  give  reasons  at
    all but merely records the account and decides that  the  claimant  was
    telling the truth.

29. Mr Bartram submitted that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  was  under  no
    duty to consider every point raised in the refusal letter.  The  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge had clearly considered the claimant's statement  of
    28 January 2014 where he commented  specifically  on  the  Reasons  for
    Refusal Letter and made the point which was  clearly  accepted  by  the
    judge that he was a young  person  from  Turkey  who  had  no  detailed
    understanding of the  policies  of  the  pro-Kurdish  parties  that  he
    supported.

30. Mr Bartram did present his arguments most attractively  but  I  am  not
    persuaded by them.

31. The Secretary of State gave very detailed reasons for disbelieving  the
    claimant in what was clearly a considered refusal letter.  The claimant
    attempted to rebut them in  his  second  statement  and  gave  detailed
    responses.  I am satisfied that more  consideration  should  have  been
    given to both the respondent's observations and the claimant's answers.
     The rather broad-brush approach of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  that
    the claimant was too young to be bothered does not deal adequately with
    all of the points raised.

32. I hope that I would be quick to say  if  the  Secretary  of  State  was
    making tedious and unreasonable criticisms of  the  determination  that
    she did not like.  This is not the case here.  The  reasons  given  are
    not adequate to show a proper  appreciation  of  the  case  before  the
    Tribunal and although I realise this would  be  disappointing  for  the
    claimant I have to say  the  determination  is  just  not  sufficiently
    detailed to be good enough in law.

33. Secondly the finding that the claimant would be at risk now because  of
    his having been in trouble in the past is not reasoned sufficiently.  I
    do not understand how the First-tier Tribunal Judge has applied IK  and
    reached the conclusion that he did.  In IK we  decided  that  a  person
    would not be at risk if that person had not been arrested.  Clearly the
    judge accepts the claimant has been  arrested  but  has  not  explained
    properly his approach to IK.

34. As I always do on reasons challenges I sat back and reflected a little.
    A determination does not  have  to  be  beyond  fair  criticism  to  be
    satisfactory.

35. I have reminded myself that the judge's reasons can be understood.   He
    did believed the claimant but I do not know why he believed him in  the
    light of the criticisms made by the respondent.

36. It follows therefore  that  I  have  to  decide  the  determination  is
    unlawful because it is reasoned inadequately.

37. Before me the parties agreed that if that was my finding the case could
    not be repaired and I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    and order the case be decided again by the First-tier Tribunal.
