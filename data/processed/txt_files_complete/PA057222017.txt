Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms K Dingwall, of Latta & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant identifies himself as a citizen of Iran, born on  13  May
    1983.  He sought asylum in the UK on 22 February 2017.

 2. In her decision dated 2 June 2017 the respondent did  not  accept  that
    the appellant is Iranian or had been involved with the KDPI,  and  held
    that he would be at no risk from the authorities in either Iran or Iraq
    (page 5 of 7).

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge J C Grant-Hutchison dismissed the appellant's
    appeal for reasons explained in her decision  promulgated  on  26  July
    2017.

 4. The appellant applied to the FtT for permission  to  appeal,  on  these
    grounds:

      It is  submitted  that  the  IJ  has  taken  into  account  irrelevant
      information when making the assessment in relation to the  appellant's
      failure to produce documentary evidence at paragraph 12.

      At  paragraph  16  it  is  stated  by  the  IJ  that  his  account  is
      inconsistent however when the evidence is looked at there is  no  true
      discrepancy and accordingly the FtT's finding is not supported by  the
      evidence (R v Secretary of State for Scotland 1999 SC (HL) 17 at 42A -
      B per Lord Clyde).

      At paragraph 20 the IJ uses speculation when making a finding that his
      account is convenient. There is no explanation and sufficient  reasons
      provided to back this assertion up.

 5. In his decision dated 18 October 2017 FtT Judge Dineen set out at �2  -
    8 general tests for identifying arguable errors of law.  At �9 he  held
    that the grounds went no further than disagreement  and  did  not  pass
    those tests.

 6. Nevertheless, the appellant sought permission from  the  UT,  advancing
    the same grounds.

 7. On 12  December  2017  UT  Judge  Bruce  granted  permission,  but  not
    apparently because she was  impressed  by  the  force  of  any  of  the
    grounds:

      Whilst the grounds are relatively weak I grant permission ...  because
      it is not immediately  obvious  from  the  decision  whether  the  FTT
      resolved the  central  question  of  fact:  what  is  the  appellant's
      nationality? The tribunal was prepared to accept that the  appellant's
      father is the martyr referred to by the KDPI in their letter at  [14]:
      it is arguable that this was prima facie evidence that he,  at  least,
      was an Iranian Kurd. The materiality of that matter is illustrated  by
      the finding at [24] "there is  no  reason  why  the  appellant  cannot
      return to Erbil": if he is not a national of Iraq, there might be.

 8. Ms Dingwall argued each of the three grounds, and also adopted the line
    suggested by the grant of permission: - The judge was bound to  make  a
    finding on nationality.  A finding of Iranian nationality  should  have
    followed from  the  finding  at  [14]  referred  to  in  the  grant  of
    permission.  The letter should have been found to support not only  the
    appellant's claimed nationality but his claim to be at risk,  connected
    to his late father.  The matter would also be relevant  to  questioning
    he might face if returned to Iran.

 9. In reply to the respondent, Ms Dingwall submitted that  even  if  there
    was an explicit finding that the appellant is  not  Iranian,  that  was
    flawed by inconsistency with the finding at [14].

10. I reserved my decision.

11. The initial refusal of permission is  unsurprising.   The  grounds  are
    only three vague expressions of selective disagreement  on  the  facts.
    They foreshadow no line of argument whereby the decision,  read  fairly
    and as a whole, might be set aside for error on a point of law.

12. The decision at [14] does not accept that the appellant's father was  a
    "martyr" to the KDPI.  It is a finding in the  alternative,  beginning,
    "Even if I accept that the appellant's father is Hama  Amin  Rezai  ...
    and that he died for the KDPI cause" and going on to explain  why  that
    would not ground a claim.

13. It was not for the FtT to divine the appellant's nationality.   It  was
    for the appellant to establish his case.

14. The judge found that the appellant had not proved he is Iranian.   Even
    if [12] and [26] are not sufficiently explicit, the decision as a whole
    is plain.

15. The grounds, the grant  of  permission  and  the  submissions  for  the
    appellant together fall short of showing that the decision of  the  FtT
    should be set aside for error on any point of law.  That decision shall
    stand.

16. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
