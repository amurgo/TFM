For the Appellant:     Ms Faryl, Counsel instructed by VC Legal (UK)
For the Respondent:  Mr Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Turkey date of birth 10th February 1982.
    He has permission[1] to appeal against the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  (Judge  Edwards)[2]  to  dismiss  his  appeal   against   the
    Respondent's decisions to refuse him a resident permit  confirming  his
    right of residence under the Turkey-EEA Association  Agreement  and  to
    remove him from the United Kingdom pursuant to s47 of  the  Immigration
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006[3].




    The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 2. The Appellant claimed to be the proprietor of a business known as "Caf�
    Delight" in Derby. The matter in issue was whether he was in  fact  the
    proprietor or whether this was "disguised employment".   The First-tier
    Tribunal found that it was disguised employment and on that  basis  had
    dismissed the appeal. The reasons given for that conclusion were:

        i) that the "fixed and restricted" hours worked  by  the  Appellant
           were more akin to that of an employee than those of an owner;


       ii) the Appellant had never bought any equipment for  his  caf�  and
           had hardly changed the menu since he acquired it;

      iii) he had not thought about how much it might be worth;

       iv) he paid his staff cash in hand;

        v) he had only ever changed the price of one thing on the menu;

       vi) he had "no real idea of any planning for the business";

      vii) on his son's birth certificate his occupation had been described
           as "coffee shop chef";

     viii) his evidence was vague.

 3. There had been evidence that the Appellant held a sub-lease on the caf�
    premises, taken from a Mr Caglar who was  the  lease  holder.  Of  this
    Judge Edwards found:


         "25. There is also a misunderstanding as to the effect of the  sub-
         lease. The appellant seems  to  identify  the  sub-lease  with  the
         actual business, as indeed did Miss Faryl. That is not correct.  It
         may be an asset of the business, but it is not the business itself.
         It is therefore clear to me that Mr Caglar retains an  interest  in
         the business".

 4. In respect of Article 8 the Tribunal found that the Appellant  did  not
    qualify for leave to remain either under paragraph 276ADE  or  Appendix
    FM. It noted that the Appellant has a British wife  and  child  who  is
    still a "babe in arms" who could  "easily  adapt  to  and  flourish  in
    Turkey". It would not be unreasonable to expect the child to leave  the
    UK.  The appeal was thereby dismissed on all grounds.



    Grounds of Appeal


 5. The grounds of appeal are that the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  the
    following material respects:

        i) The dispute between the parties, as articulated in the Secretary
           of State's refusal letter was whether  the  Appellant  could  be
           said to be the owner of the caf� when he was not  the  owner  of
           the property from which it operates. It is  submitted  that  the
           First-tier Tribunal failed to resolve that question of fact;


       ii) The determination gives rise to "real  concern  and  unease"  in
           that it  appears  to  omit  reference  to  evidence  capable  of
           establishing that the Appellant is in fact  the  owner  of  Caf�
           Delight.   That failure, it is submitted, demonstrates a  "clear
           lack of impartiality".  For instance:

                 a) In reference the  hours  worked  by  the  Appellant  the
                    determination  misrepresents  his  evidence.   What   he
                    actually said was that he does not  work  six  days  per
                    week eight hours a day  and  that  sometimes  he  leaves
                    staff in charge, for instance when his child  was  sick;




                 b) The determination refers to the fact that the  Appellant
                    pays his employees "cash in hand" but not  to  the  fact
                    that he also issues them with payslips;

                 c) The Appellant's evidence that  he  does  not  receive  a
                    payslip himself is not recorded,  nor  is  the  evidence
                    that his pay varies depending on  how  the  business  is
                    doing;

                 d) The Appellant had said that he had  changed  the  prices
                    on the menu - he had mentioned one item in  response  to
                    a specific request to give a single example;

      iii) The Article 8 assessment is "perfunctory and inadequate",  there
           being a failure to consider s55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and
           Immigration Act 2009 or the fact that the Appellant's  wife  was
           pregnant at the date of the appeal.


 6. In her oral submissions Ms Faryl  reiterated  that  in  fact  the  only
    reason given by the Respondent had been that the Appellant did not  own
    the building. She submitted that this was the only matter that required
    the Tribunal's attention.  The analysis of this question  at  paragraph
    25 of the determination was difficult to understand.


    The Response


 7. The Respondent's Rule 24 response is dated  11th  November  2014.  This
    submits that the Judge gave clear reasons why he did  not  accept  that
    the Appellant was running this business. In  his  oral  submissions  Mr
    Avery points out that the evidence that is said to be  omitted  is  not
    particularly relevant because  it  would  all  equally  be  capable  of
    establishing that the Appellant is the manager  of  the  caf�.  As  for
    Article 8 there was very little evidence for him to go on.




    Error of Law


 8. The Respondent had put in issue whether this was  a  real  business  or
    disguised  employment.   The  refusal  letter  had  doubted  that   the
    Appellant owned this caf� because he did not  own  the  building.   The
    Tribunal had dealt with this matter at paragraph 25, cited again here:


         "25. There is also a misunderstanding as to the effect of the  sub-
         lease. The appellant seems  to  identify  the  sub-lease  with  the
         actual business, as indeed did Miss Faryl. That is not correct.  It
         may be an asset of the business, but it is not the business itself.
         It is therefore clear to me that Mr Caglar retains an  interest  in
         the business".


 9. In the course of her submissions Ms Faryl made three  complaints  about
    this.


10. The first is that the Tribunal should simply have made findings on this
    point and that would have resolved the matters in issue. She  suggested
    that since this was the only matter raised in the refusal  letter  that
    was the only point that the determination needed to address.  I do  not
    agree. Where the nature of an applicant's relationship with a  business
    is put in issue the Tribunal is entitled, indeed obliged,  to  look  at
    all of the evidence in the round: see Akinci (paragraph  21  HC  510  -
    correct approach) [2012] UKUT 00266(IAC).

11. The fact that the determination does not set out her submission on this
    matter is the second complaint. That was that there are plenty of small
    businesses which  operate  from  buildings  leased  from  others.   The
    refusal letter was illogical to suggest otherwise. That is quite  true,
    and it is a point that the Tribunal has not addressed. I am not however
    satisfied that paragraphs 24-25 had very much to do with the First-tier
    Tribunal's decision. Unlike the author  of  the  refusal  letter  Judge
    Edwards has not treated the matter of ownership as determinative.    It
    would appear from the determination that these paragraphs were inserted
    only in response to Ms  Faryl's  submission  that  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant had taken a  sub-lease  meant  that  he  must  be  running  a
    business  from  there.    I  agree  with  Judge  Edwards  that  such  a
    submission would not be well founded. It would be one of  a  number  of
    relevant considerations, but would not on its own be capable of proving
    that the Appellant is in fact the proprietor of Caf� Delight.

12. The third complaint is that paragraph  25  does  not  really  make  any
    sense. I agree. The Judge is quite correct to say  that  the  sub-lease
    should not be equated with the actual business, but it is not clear how
    he went from that to the finding that "Mr Caglar retains an interest in
    the business". Mr Caglar may be the sub-lessor, but that does not  mean
    that he has any interest in the caf�  itself.   Whilst  I  struggle  to
    understand the logic of paragraph 25, I do not  see  that  it  had  any
    significant impact on the overall reasoning of the determination.  That
    is because the core of the decision is to be found  in  the  paragraphs
    that follow.

13. This brings me to the second ground of appeal.  That  is,  in  essence,
    that the determination is selective with  the  evidence.  There  are  a
    number of matters, capable of being weighed in the Appellant's  favour,
    which have not been recorded or considered. At the hearing I had regard
    to the Record of Proceedings and  the  representatives  very  helpfully
    read from their own notes. Mr Avery agreed that the points set  out  in
    Ms Faryl's grounds (summarised above) were substantially in accord with
    the HOPO's record of the  hearing.  Having  read  the  typed  note  she
    supplied, I find that the determination does not set out that  evidence
    in full, and in places contains inaccuracies. In particular

        i) Paragraph 18(b) records the evidence that  the  Appellant  works
           eight hours per day or less, six days a week. At paragraph 26(a)
           the Tribunal finds that these hours are "more akin to  those  of
           an employee to those of an owner".  This  finding  cannot  stand
           since it is agreed that what the Appellant actually said was  "I
           don't work 6 days, not 8 hours everyday. Because child not well,
           sometimes I leave staff in charge. I don't work more than  eight
           hrs" [my emphasis].


       ii) Paragraph 19(d) records the  evidence  that  the  Appellant  has
           altered the price of one item on the menu. Paragraph 26(b) cites
           this evidence as a reason for rejecting his evidence that he  is
           the proprietor: "he has, apart from one isolated instance, never
           changed the menu". This finding is  not  sustainable  since  the
           actual evidence (reproduced from the agreed record) was:


           |Since you had the business have you|Yes                                |
|increased or reduced the prices?   |                                   |
|Can you give me an example that you|I changed the breakfast to �5.20   |
|increased or decreased?            |and since then it started          |


           It is apparent from this exchange that the  First-tier  Tribunal
           has  misunderstood  the  evidence.  It  was  not  one  "isolated
           instance", it was an example.


      iii)  At  paragraph  18(a)  the  determination   records   that   the
           Appellant's evidence was that he had  "no  idea"  how  much  the
           business was worth but if he were to sell it he "would  rely  on
           the purchaser's estimate".  This  is  found,  at  26(c),  to  be
           "incredible". The agreed record  shows  that  the  exchange  was
           markedly different:


           |How much would you say business    |I rent it for 3,000                |
|worth today?                       |                                   |
|You can't sell your business, is   |I'm not thinking about selling     |
|that right?                        |                                   |
|Suggest you don't know how much its|Its not I don't know I rented for 3|
|worth?                             |years at the end of the day if I   |
|                                   |would sell I would talk to people  |
|                                   |of how much its worth              |


           The Appellant does not state that he  has  "no  idea"  what  his
           business is worth, or that he would rely  on  the  purchaser  to
           name a price. He said that he was not thinking  of  selling  but
           that if he was, he would take advice.

       iv) The grounds further point out that paragraph  19(b)  appears  to
           raise  some  doubt  about  deposit  of  �3000  made   into   the
           Appellant's current account: "I was told  that  it  was  from  a
           savings account but no statement of such  an  account  has  been
           provided to me".  A statement relating to  the  savings  account
           was in fact before the Tribunal, showing the withdrawal  of  the
           �3000 [at page 107 Appellant's bundle].

14. As Mr Avery points out, these were not the sum total of the  Tribunal's
    findings. Particular reliance is placed on paragraph 27  in  which  the
    Judge  finds  "of  considerable  significance"  the   fact   that   the
    Appellant's occupation is given on his  child's  birth  certificate  as
    "coffee shop chef".   Mr Avery further asks me to find that none of the
    actual evidence was capable of showing the Appellant to have  been  the
    owner as opposed to a manager.


15. I have considered Mr Avery's submissions carefully. I  am  not  however
    satisfied that the determination can  stand.  Where  the  determination
    gives seven reasons for finding against the  Appellant,  and  at  least
    four of these are based on a  misunderstanding  of  the  evidence,  the
    overall reasoning must be infected. I  cannot  be  satisfied  that  the
    decision would have been the same if the First-tier  Tribunal  had  had
    regard to the actual evidence. For that reason the  determination  must
    be set aside.

16. Ground 2 having been made out, I need not deal with the determination's
    assessment of Article 8.


    The Re-Making

17. The parties were in agreement that if error were to  be  found  in  the
    determination, I should remake the decision on the evidence before me.


18. It is the Appellant's case that he is the owner of Caf�  Delight.   The
    Respondent's refusal letter finds that  the  Appellant  has  failed  to
    provide "convincing" evidence that this is the case, but  this  is  not
    the appropriate standard: he must establish that this is  his  business
    on the balance of probabilities.


19. The Respondent's analysis of the application  was  based  on  a  search
    conducted on 30th March 2012 with the land registry (Nottingham Office)
    which shows that the title absolute to the property is held by  Mustafa
    Caglar; there were no entries  for  registered  leases,  sub-leases  or
    licence agreements.   The conclusion is drawn that the Appellant has no
    interest in the property; ergo he has no interest in Caf� Delight.


20. The Appellant adopted his witness statement dated 19th  February  2014.
    He agrees that the Land Registry will not have a  record  of  the  sub-
    lease he agreed with Mustafa Caglar,  because  he  is  effectively  his
    tenant: as it is only of three years duration it does not  have  to  be
    registered. He points out that when he made his application he provided
    various pieces of evidence, which he now relies upon to show that he is
    the person who is running the caf�. This  material  included  his  bank
    statement showing a transfer withdrawal of �3000 which is  said  to  be
    the deposit paid for the business in December 2012, invoices  addressed
    to him at the caf� for payment of council  tax  and  landfill  tax,   a
    Certificate  of  Employer's  Liability  Insurance  issued  by  Maltings
    Insurance in the name of  "Adem  Tasdemir  Trading  as  Caf�  Delight",
    various utility bills also in that name, and a letter dated  9th  April
    2013 from HMRC, addressed to the Appellant in the following terms: "our
    records show that you are a new employer but  you  have  not  paid  any
    PAYE".  He also provides:

        i) A letter dated 22nd January  2013  from  A  Dervish  Accountants
           which states that  the  Appellant  has  been  a  "self  employed
           business entrepreneur since 1st December 2012 trading under  the
           name of Caf� Delight"


       ii) Commercial Rent Agreement dated 1st  December  2012  showing  an
           agreement between the Appellant and Mustafa Caglar to  rent  the
           shop at 51 Oxford St. It has been drawn up by Blunts  Solicitors
           of Newcastle-under-Lyme. The tenant is the Appellant and  he  is
           identified as "trading as Caf� Delight". The agreement  is  that
           he will pay Mr Caglar �13, 400 per annum,  accompanied  by  bank
           statements showing transfers, and receipts where  the  rent  has
           been paid in cash;

      iii) Lloyds TSB statements in the name of  the  Appellant  "T/A  Caf�
           Delight" which show him to be paying  utility  bills  from  that
           account;

       iv) A witness statement dated 19th February 2014 from Mustafa Caglar
           confirming that he had to stop  running  the  caf�  due  to  ill
           health and that in December 2012 he signed a three  year  rental
           agreement with the Appellant. Mr Caglar provides  a  copy  of  a
           certificate signed by his GP confirming that he is  not  fit  to
           work;

        v) Birth certificate of the Appellant's son, dated 12th March 2015,
           in which he is said to be a 'coffee shop owner'.


21. The file also contains a witness statement from Wendy  Gilbert  of  the
    HMRC. This was produced by  the  Respondent.  It  shows  that  when  Ms
    Gilbert ran a check on the Appellant's records they showed  that  since
    the 1st December 2012 he has been registered as self-employed running a
    caf� called Caf� Delight and that he declared a turnover of �59,162  in
    2012-2013.


22. It is agreed between the parties that any interest that  the  Appellant
    might have in the property accommodating Caf� Delight is not registered
    with the Land Registry.  It is the significance of that fact  which  is
    in issue.     The Appellant's case is that as a tenant  of  only  three
    years there was no legal requirement to register  the  commercial  rent
    agreement he has signed with Mr Caglar. Neither party has  provided  me
    with any legal authority one way or the other about this. What  I  have
    got is  a  good  deal  of  evidence,  dating  back  to  December  2012,
    connecting the Appellant with Caf� Delight. Mr Avery submits that  this
    evidence is of little assistance to me since it is all equally  capable
    of showing him to be the manager, employed  by  Mr  Caglar.  I  do  not
    agree. I do not consider that an employee would take out  an  insurance
    policy in his  own  name  accepting  employer's  liability  for  others
    working, or indeed visiting, the shop. I do not accept that  a  manager
    would register as the owner of the business with the HMRC and  so  make
    himself liable for the not insubstantial tax that is owed.   All of the
    evidence before me, set out above, points one way. All of the  evidence
    bar one document.


23. That document is the birth certificate of the Appellant's  eldest  son,
    who was born in October 2013. When the Appellant registered  his  birth
    in November of that year he told the Registrar that his occupation  was
    'coffee shop chef'. This was a  matter  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    placed some weight on. I see from the record of proceedings (and indeed
    Counsel's note, agreed as broadly accurate by Mr Avery) that  this  was
    not something which formed any part of the Respondent's case, either in
    cross-examination or in submissions.  I have not therefore received any
    explanation from the Appellant about why he might have  used  the  term
    'chef' rather than 'owner'.

24. I have considered all of this evidence in the round. I have weighed the
    matter of the birth certificate against the Appellant, and I have taken
     the submissions made on behalf  of  the  Respondent,  in  the  refusal
    letter, by Mr Tan at first instance and by Mr  Avery  before  me,  into
    account. Having done so I find myself  satisfied,  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities, that the Appellant is  indeed  the  proprietor  of  Caf�
    Delight, a coffee shop which he leases from Mr Caglar.  The  fact  that
    the Land Registry has not been notified  about  this  rental  agreement
    does not outweigh the remainder of the evidence. I therefore allow  the
    appeal.

      Decisions

25. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error  of  law
    and it is set aside.


26. I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.

27. I make no direction for anonymity.

      Fees




      The appeal has been allowed, largely on evidence that was before the
      Respondent at the date of decision. I therefore make a full fee award.
