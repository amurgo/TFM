Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Iqbal, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 4th December 1986.   The
    Appellant first entered the United Kingdom on 2nd September  2010  with
    conferred leave to enter as a Tier 4 (General) Student until  27th  May
    2012.  That leave was subsequently extended as a  Tier  1  (Post-Study)
    Migrant until 16th June 2014.

 2. On 13th June 2014 the Appellant made a combined application  for  leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant
    under the points-based system  (PBS)  and  for  a  biometric  residence
    permit (BRP).  That application was refused by the Secretary  of  State
    by Notice of Refusal dated  24th  June  2014  on  the  basis  that  the
    Appellant did not meet the requirements of Appendix A.

 3. The Appellant appealed and the appeal came before Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Khan sitting at Richmond Magistrates' Court on 4th  March
    2015.   In  a  determination  promulgated  on  20th  March   2015   the
    Appellant's appeal was dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

 4. The Appellant lodged Grounds of Appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  on  2nd
    April 2015.  On 18th May 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Shimmin granted
    permission to appeal.  Judge Shimmin noted that the First-tier Tribunal
    Judge had dismissed the appeal on the basis that  the  Appellant  could
    not rely on new evidence sought to be introduced at  the  hearing.   He
    noted however that the Appellant claimed that she was  not  allowed  to
    argue her case at the hearing on the basis  of  the  original  document
    submitted with the application alone and that it was therefore arguable
    that there was procedural unfairness.  No Rule 24 reply appears to have
    been served by the Secretary of State.

 5. It is on that basis that  the  appeal  comes  before  me  to  determine
    whether or not there is a material error of law in the decision of  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.   The  Appellant  is  represented  by  her
    instructed Counsel Mr Iqbal.  The Secretary of  State  appears  by  her
    Home Office Presenting Officer Mr Nath.

Submissions/Discussions

 6. Mr Iqbal takes me to the Grounds of Appeal.  He points out that this is
    the first hearing at which the Appellant has had  legal  representation
    having appeared in person before the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  having
    submitted her own application form back in June 2014.  He takes  me  to
    the reasons for refusal and points out that there were three  documents
    that the Secretary of State required  as  evidence  of  access  to  the
    Appellant's start up funds of ï¿½50,000 for her marketing business  which
    were not provided with the application.  These were firstly letter from
    the Financial Institution from which the third party, Mr Akbar's, funds
    are held in order to establish that those funds were accessible to  the
    Appellant as specified under paragraph 41-SD(c)(i) of Appendix A of the
    Immigration Rules.

 7. Secondly bank statements were required.  He points out  that  the  bank
    statements provided were not  acceptable  to  the  Secretary  of  State
    because they were for an account not in the Appellant's name.   Thirdly
    a declaration, but no declaration from a legal representative had  been
    supplied to establish that the letter of permission supplied was  valid
    as  specified  under  paragraph  41-SD(d)(ii)  of  Appendix  A  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  He is at pains to emphasise that the Appellant  now
    has all the correct documentation.  He acknowledges that the  Rules  do
    not allow this documentation to be admitted late.

 8. He contends in respect of the letter from the Financial Institution  in
    which Mr Akbar's funds were held that even  though  a  letter  was  not
    provided the personal bank statement of Mr  Akbar  submitted  with  the
    application was sufficient to meet the requirements  of  paragraph  41-
    SD(c)(ii) of Appendix A and that this is in fact emphasised  even  more
    by the fact that the Appellant was not able to provide the letter  with
    the application only for the reason that UK banks do not  provide  such
    letters.  He points out that paragraph 245AA of the  Immigration  Rules
    does not contain all the  specified  information  of  documents  to  be
    provided and that there is procedural  impropriety  in  the  manner  in
    which the judge rushed to his conclusions.  He takes me to paragraph  9
    of the decision which states,

         "Since  the  Appellant  did  not  submit  the  documents  which  he
         submitted at the appeal hearing when she made her application,  the
         Tribunal cannot take these documents into consideration."

    He submits that the judge ignored the fact that the  Appellant  clearly
    expressed that the purpose of submitting new documents was the  clarity
    of the issues raised in the Respondent's refusal letter  and  that  she
    was aware that it was in the judge's discretion whether he would accept
    the new evidence or not.  He points out that the Appellant declared  at
    the hearing (and she was a litigant in person) that  she  could  defend
    her original documents submitted with the application regardless of the
    judge not accepting the new documents but that the judge ignored  this.
    He consequently submits firstly that there is no  reference  whatsoever
    within the determination to paragraph 245AA and secondly  the  decision
    to dismiss the appeal was consequently irrational and unfair.

 9. It  is,  Mr  Iqbal  contends,  not  that  documents  were  missing  but
    information that was missing.  The Appellant had a bank letter and  the
    only defect was that the Appellant's name was not inserted and that  in
    respect of the bank statement provided it was not  in  the  applicant's
    name but rather the third party.  Further in respect of the declaration
    from the  legal  representative  the  Appellant  had  the  third  party
    declaration attested by a legal representative containing his signature
    and company stamp on it with the belief that that would suffice.

10. Finally he submits that going back to the Notice of Refusal at  page  4
    the reference therein to paragraph 245AA(c) actually reflects  a  wrong
    application of paragraph 245AA in that this is not a  case  of  missing
    documents but a case of missing information.

11. Mr Nath in brief response whilst acknowledging all this points out that
    there are difficulties with the Appellant's submission and that she has
    quite simply failed to meet the attributes section of Appendix  A.   He
    submits that  the  Secretary  of  State  has  followed  quite  properly
    paragraph 41-SD and his submission is that there is no  material  error
    of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

The Law

12.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

13. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings

14. The Appellant in  this  matter  has,  perhaps  ill-advisedly,  made  an
    application without the benefit of legal representation.  She felt that
    she had followed the correct procedure but it is clear from the  Notice
    of Refusal that certain required information as set out in  the  Notice
    of Refusal was not submitted with the application.  It is  acknowledged
    that  that  missing  information  is  now  available  but   under   the
    Immigration Rules it cannot  be  admitted  in  evidence.   This  is  an
    Appellant who has good educational qualifications and wishes to set  up
    what I am sure  she  hopes  will  be  a  long-standing  and  successful
    marketing business but she cannot do so unless or  until  she  acquires
    the requisite visa.  It is therefore of fundamental importance  to  the
    Appellant that her visa can be obtained and indeed obtained as soon  as
    possible.

15. It would not be open to the Appellant to submit a  further  application
    as her current visa has expired and all that is extant relates  to  her
    present  appeal.   The  basis  upon  which  the  judge  has  given  his
    determination only appears to have one flaw in it namely that page 4 of
    the Notice of Refusal does I acknowledge reflect a wrong application of
    the interpretation of paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules in  that
    it makes specific reference to missing documents which is not the  case
    in this appeal but that of missing information.  In an otherwise  sound
    determination the judge has failed to consider this and  in  particular
    the general provisions of paragraph 245AA and I  am  prepared  to  find
    that such an error is material.

16. In such circumstances I  find  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is not in accordance with the law and I remit the matter  back
    to  the  Secretary  of  State  for  further   consideration.    It   is
    acknowledged by both legal representatives that if I take  this  course
    of action then it will be open  for  the  new  documentation  which  is
    available and which should have been with the original  application  to
    be provided to the Secretary of State.  Obviously any decision taken is
    for the Secretary of State but this will at least give  the  Appellant,
    whose whole  future  rises  and  falls  on  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision, one final chance to ensure the proper documentation is before
    the Secretary of State when considering her application.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of  law
and is set aside.  The finding of the Upper Tribunal  is  that  the  initial
decision is not in accordance with the law and that the matter is  therefore
remitted back to the Secretary of State for reconsideration.

No anonymity direction is made.
