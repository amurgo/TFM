For the Respondent:    Ms S Sreeraman, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant, a national  of  Albania,  date  of  birth  5  May  1991,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision, dated 2 December  2014,  to
    refuse to issue a residence  card  with  particular  reference  to  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 Regulation 6 (the
    2006 Regulations).  The basis of refusal  was  that  the  wife  of  the
    Appellant had failed to provide evidence to show that she was  for  the
    purposes of such application a qualified person at material  times  and
    because she had failed to establish  that  she  had  been  in  work  at
    material times. No removal directions were made and  the  Secretary  of
    State gave notice that before removal was to  occur  further  decisions
    would be made.  In the circumstances there was no  Section  120  notice
    and accordingly Article 8  ECHR  considerations  did  not  fall  to  be
    considered.

2.     First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Geraint  Jones  QC,  on  16  July  2015,
    dismissed the appeal under the 2006 Regulations and made  no  anonymity
    order.

3.   An application to appeal was made  against  the  judge's  decision  and
    permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede  on  26  November
    2015.  The Respondent served a Rule 24 statement supporting the judge's
    decision and arguing that the findings made by the judge in  connection
    with the Appellant's spouse, Ms Naydenova, were  sustainable  and  that
    the grounds were simply a disagreement with findings of fact made.

4.   The permission granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede was put in  these
    terms:

         "It is arguable that the judge,  in  making  his  adverse  findings
         about the Appellant's wife's status as a qualified person, erred in
         his calculation of her earnings, having  arguably  failed  to  take
         account of the period of time after the birth of their  child  when
         she was not working.  It may well be that  any  arguable  error  in
         that respect was immaterial in  the  light  of  the  other  adverse
         findings he made, but the point is at least arguable."


5.   It seemed to me in the light of the submissions made that  the  figure,
    by itself, of the Ms Naydenova's earnings may have  been  miscalculated
    to a degree.  It was plain, as  a  fact,  that  there  was  a  material
    difference between the hours said to be worked by Ms Naydenova as given
    by her employer, North London Property Development Limited, and that as
    given by her.  The former said that she worked an average of  24  hours
    per week, a similar figure found in the application  form,  whereas  Ms
    Naydenova's evidence was that she worked about sixteen  hours  a  week.
    It was not possible for the judge nor in the submissions made to me  to
    reconcile that matter.  Secondly, the calculations as rewritten for the
    purposes of the hearing today show that for  a  significant  period  of
    time the Appellant, whether working sixteen or 24 hours  a  week,  must
    have been earning significantly less than the  national  minimum  wage:
    Albeit that later payslips relating to 2015 showed pay in  two  periods
    or in one period combined with another at a rate  of  ï¿½6.70  per  hour,
    which was around about the national minimum wage.  Either way,  whether
    the judge got the calculation wrong with reference  to  Ms  Naydenova's
    evidence or by reference to the employer's evidence ultimately  matters
    little. It did not seem to me that such error, assuming there  was  one
    for these purposes, would make a material difference to the outcome  of
    the appeal.

6.   The judge  plainly  had  information  before  him  that  suggested  the
    Appellant was dishonest as to his past and had acted  clandestinely  in
    relation to his immigration activities or status.

7.   The judge also, perhaps surprisingly in view of the  evidence  that  he
    recorded, took the view that so far as the Appellant was  concerned  he
    had married the EEA national, Ms Naydenova, a citizen of  Bulgaria,  in
    September 2014 but simply that was  a  contrivance  to  enable  him  to
    remain as the spouse of an EEA national exercising treaty  rights.   It
    was a surprising conclusion to reach bearing in mind that the judge was
    aware that Ms Naydenova had been off work and continued to work  whilst
    the Appellant was looking after their child born on 30 September 2014.

8.   In this respect, whatever the  appalling  immigration  history  of  the
    Appellant may have been, the fact of the matter was that their having a
    child and living together, was at least a strong indication  that  they
    were in a  permanent  and  durable  relationship  and  that,  with  the
    presence of the child, they intended to remain  together.   It  is  not
    said that  there  were  other  contraindications  as  to  their  mutual
    intention to remain together as husband and wife on a permanent  basis.
    I therefore dismiss from the consideration of the error of law  whether
    the judge was entitled to come to that  view  which  he  did  that  the
    Appellant was  a  dishonest  man  who  had  contrived  with  others  to
    misrepresent the alleged employment of Ms Naydenova.   The  judge  also
    generally rejected the credibility of the claimed relationship.

9.     In addition, although it was hard to find a reason for it, the  judge
    did not accept Ms Naydenova's employer was  anything  other  than  some
    form of entity  which  the  Appellant  controlled  or  had  significant
    involvement in so as to generate false  evidence,  nor  did  the  judge
    regard it as coincidence that a 'Mr A Beqiri', an original director  of
    Ms  Naydenova  employer  company,  was  someone  different   from   the
    Appellant.  I find  the  judge's  reasoning  difficult  to  understand,
    unless the judge was essentially saying that Mr A Beqiri was in fact an
    alter ego of Mr K Beqiri, the Appellant.  Certainly  if  that  was  the
    case it did not appear to have anything to do with the EEA national, Ms
    Naydenova, being a qualified person but more to suggest that they  were
    all, a party to a gross misrepresentation of the status of Ms Naydenova
    as a qualified person under the 2006 Regulations.

10.  Having considered the judge's decision it seemed to me that there  were
    gaps in the evidence which could have been addressed, not least by  the
    employer of Ms Naydenova, which has now gone out of business, and by Ms
    Naydenova  herself  in   terms   of,   perhaps   with   the   help   of
    representatives, a better presentation of the financial position  which
    she was said to have enjoyed.   The  judge  also  did  not  accept  the
    claimed pay of Ms Naydenova by way  of  bank  and  cash  payments.   Ms
    Naydenova gave evidence to the effect that she was so paid in that  way
    and it is hard to see why the judge rejected that  evidence  albeit  it
    was open to him do so for he gave sufficient and adequate reasons.

11.  Having set these matters out, I do  not  conclude,  the  evidence  then
    advanced to the judge, was sufficient to show that, Ms Naydenova, was a
    qualified person. It was open to her to adduce evidence of her earnings
    and her current circumstances as a jobseeker. I am satisfied  that  the
    original Tribunal although the reasoning was very varied, to  a  degree
    somewhat lacking in a fulsome explanation of those  reasons,  reflected
    the fact that the judge simply did not believe, in  the  light  of  the
    known circumstances, that the Appellant's past was credible.  Thus  the
    judge's concerns that the Appellant was a dishonest  person  who  could
    act clandestinely and, as he saw it, would act  clandestinely  tied  in
    with the inadequate evidence of Ms  Naydenova's  as  presented  to  the
    judge.  In those circumstances the judge was entitled to  reject  those
    matters.

12.  Ms Rothwell properly took the point that even if a person such  as  the
    Appellant has a poor immigration history and matters which can properly
    be held against his credibility in making an application under the  EEA
    Regulations that poor history is not a basis to refuse to  consider  an
    EEA application albeit it may be relevant  to  the  assessment  of  the
    quality of evidence advanced.

13.  Looking at the matter in the round I take the  view  that  the  judge's
    decision did not disclose, however much one may differ with aspects  of
    it, a material  error  of  law  on  the  sufficiency  of  the  evidence
    pertinent to those matters: The burden of proof lay upon the  Appellant
    to show on a  balance  of  probabilities  that  Ms  Naydenova,  did  at
    material times meet the requirements of the Regulation 6.  This was not
    so much with reference to the level of the earnings but rather  to  the
    material relating to the employer and the disparities or  discrepancies
    in account between hours worked  and  the  underlying  concerns  raised
    about the rate of pay.

 14. It will be open to the Appellant and his partner to make a  fuller  and
    more accurate presentation of the position in a further application  to
    remain under the Rules.  They are not at risk of removal and  there  is
    no need therefore to take the matter, at this stage, any further.

15.  For these reasons therefore  I  find  the  Original  Tribunal  decision
    stands. The appeal is dismissed.
