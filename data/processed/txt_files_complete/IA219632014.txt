For the Respondent:    Mr P Collins, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but for the purposes of this decision I will refer to the parties
    as they were described before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  is  the
    Secretary of State as the respondent and Mr Ibie as the appellant.  The
    appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 21 May 1979 and  he  appealed
    against a decision dated 20 April 2014 to refuse him further  leave  to
    remain and to remove him from the United Kingdom further to Section  47
    of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

2.   The background to this appeal  is  that  the  appellant  had  lived  in
    Nigeria until 2007.  He studied  and  undertook  national  service  and
    again came to the UK entering on 23 September 2007 as a student and was
    awarded an MSc degree in Information  Systems  and  Management  by  the
    London South Bank University.

3.   In 2008 he met, and subsequently married in 2010,  a  British  national
    named Stephanie Ann-Marie Francois.  He stated he  was  the  victim  of
    domestic violence but did not claim under the Immigration Rules.

4.   On 21 March 2011 he was granted leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom
    until 23 March 2014.  On 17 March 2014 he made an application for leave
    to remain on the basis that he  believed  a  reconciliation  was  still
    possible and his then  wife  was  then  named  as  a  partner  in  that
    application.  According to  the  appellant,  unbeknown  to  him  on  16
    January 2014 a decree absolute had already been granted.

5.   The reasons for refusal letter refused the appellant's  application  on
    the basis of his private life and further to paragraph 276ADE and under
    Appendix FM, in particular paragraph D-LTRP 1.3 and R-LTRP  1.1(c)  and
    (d).   He  was  also  served  with  a  Section  120  notice  under  the
    Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

6.   In his grounds of appeal the appellant stated  that  there  was  a  new
    relationship between him and a British national by birth, Miss  Adesuwa
    Erinmwioghae.  At the date of the decision she was  pregnant  with  the
    unborn child of the couple.  It was recorded at paragraph  8  that  the
    appellant and his  now  partner,  had  been  in  a  relationship  since
    February 2013.

7.   Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Freer  made  a  finding  of  fact  at
    paragraph 39 that the appellant was the  father  of  the  unborn  child
    carried by Ms Erinmwioghae and there  was  a  relevant  pregnancy.   He
    found some slight inconsistency  about  future  plans  but  nonetheless
    found that at [51]:

         "The appellant's position is stronger than in such an outline  [50]
         (sic) since he has lawful entry rights, his partner has  family  in
         the UK, and his family life will be significantly disrupted  if  he
         has to send any time at all overseas while his partner is pregnant"



    and further the judge recorded:

         "Further  the  appellant  would  already  satisfy  the   two   year
         relationship rule  when  he  reached  Nigeria  so  it  would  be  a
         favourable climate for such an application.  His partner's payslips
         in the bundle show that she is paid almost  �2,000  gross  in  each
         payslip so the couple do meet the �18,600 earnings  threshold  more
         than comfortably."

8.   At [59] the judge found that  "there  were  no  difficulties  for  this
    appellant found in Section  117B.   There  are  a  number  of  positive
    factors".

9.   An application for permission to appeal was  made  on  the  basis  that
    there were perverse findings to the degree that they  were  irrational.
    It was irrational to find the relationship to be one which was  genuine
    and subsisting  when  the  evidence  before  the  judge  was  that  the
    application under appeal was one that related to  the  appellant's  ex-
    wife not the claimed partner on which the judge  had  found  favour  on
    Article 8.

10.  At paragraph 8 of his determination Judge Freer recorded  that  it  was
    only in the grounds of appeal that the appellant raised the  fact  that
    he wished to rely on  this  new  relationship  and  that  it  had  been
    subsisting for two years.  It was perverse to accept that  the  initial
    application was put in good faith as despite separation  the  appellant
    hoped for a reconciliation with his wife and was unaware at that  point
    that the decree absolute had been granted  in  January  2014.   It  was
    submitted that the appellant could not  have  it  both  ways.   It  was
    irrational to conclude that he was making attempts  to  reconcile  with
    his wife and therefore submitted a genuine application  whilst  at  the
    same time as having a  qualified  relationship  with  his  alleged  new
    partner.

11.  It was also submitted  that  this  should  have  been  weighed  in  the
    balance when considering the public  interest  factors  within  Section
    117B  and  specifically  the  maintenance  of   effective   immigration
    controls.  The positive finding that the appellant had  always  resided
    legally in the United Kingdom was clearly in doubt given the fact  that
    divorce proceedings, even if uncontested  normally  take  a  couple  of
    months at the very latest, and would indicate that they  had  commenced
    in October 2013 but he did not make his application until March 2014 by
    which time the marriage was dissolved.

12.  It was further submitted that the judge had  failed  to  identify  what
    about this case was exceptional and why it was  necessary  to  consider
    the case outside those Rules.

13.  Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Frankish
    who confirmed that arguably Section 120 of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 had been over-extended to  include  a  totally  new
    case the remedy for which was a new application.

14.  At the hearing Mr Avery submitted that the appellant had  discretionary
    leave to remain on  the  basis  of  a  marriage  and  he  had  made  an
    application on the basis of his marriage in  March  2014.   However  at
    paragraph 8 of the determination it  is  recorded  that  he  was  in  a
    relationship with someone else from February 2013.  Even the notice  of
    appeal appeared to be based on the relationship with his ex-wife.   The
    judge failed to take that into account on a credibility finding.  There
    is no mention of a new relationship in the grounds of appeal.  This was
    a significant factor and it was perverse  that  there  was  a  lack  of
    reasoning.

15.  There was no reason to look at Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40  because
    this appeal was made on the basis it was to be considered  outside  the
    Rules.  There was a failure to show how Chikwamba was relevant  on  the
    face of reading the decision.

16.  As such the public interest had not been given  adequate  consideration
    and there was a failure to make relevant findings under Section 117.

17.  Mr Collins referred to the judge's finding at  paragraph  56  that  the
    evidence disclosed compelling circumstances and there was reference  to
    Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 albeit
    that there was not a detailed exploration.  The case was never  run  on
    the basis that it was inside the Immigration Rules.  The judge had both
    parties in front of him and any questions could have been asked by  the
    Home Office Presenting Officer.   The  judge  was  not  prevented  from
    taking into account new evidence.  Indeed it  is  clear  he  took  into
    account the whole of the history of the appellant.

18.  In conclusion I am not persuaded that the judge was perverse but  there
    was, inadequate reasoning as to why when it was recorded at paragraph 6
    of the determination that there was an application  made  on  17  March
    2014 for further leave to remain as a spouse of his wife, and  then  at
    paragraph 8 a record that there was a further claim that there had been
    a relationship established  since  February  2013  and,  as  the  judge
    recorded, very nearly two years at the date of the hearing.  The  judge
    did not give any reasoning as to the  apparent  discrepancies  and  the
    impact on the credibility of the application and the credibility of the
    appellant.

19.  There also appeared to be a contradiction in the  decision  when  there
    was reference to Chikwamba albeit that the judge had accepted that  the
    Immigration Rules could not be fulfilled.  This was not just a question
    of a formal application from abroad.  The appellant was not married and
    could not make an application on the basis of a two  year  relationship
    because the application had not  been  founded  on  the  basis  of  the
    relationship with his partner but on the relationship with his ex-wife.



20.  I also note that with reference to Section 117  that  the  judge  found
    there were "a number of positive factors".   As it  is  these  positive
    factors were not strictly identified save that he had a Masters  Degree
    and earned �2,000 gross  per  month.   Section  117B  does  not  convey
    "positive factors" in the light of the public interest consideration AM
    (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC) and a review of the case law can
    be found in R (on the application of Zermani) [2015] EWHC 1226 (Admin).
     The case law indicates that factors put forward such as value  to  the
    community should be considered as they might affect the  weight  to  be
    attached to the Secretary of State's position, however, it would make a
    difference in relatively few cases.  It is clear that the  Home  Office
    position  was  that  the  appellant  had  clearly  made  a   misleading
    application and this was evident from the face of the decision  because
    the application had been made at a time when the appellant was  in  the
    UK on the basis of a relationship with someone when  he  was  having  a
    relationship with someone else.

21.  In the light of these difficulties with the decision I found  there  is
    a material error of law particularly with the fundamental facts of  the
    credibility of the relationship and both  representatives  agreed  that
    the matter should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal in view of the
    nature and extent of the findings to be made.



Notice of Decision

The Judge erred materially for the reasons  identified.   I  set  aside  the
decision  pursuant  to  Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals   Courts   and
Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and  extent  of
the findings to be made the matter should  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007 and further to 7.2  (b)
of the Presidential Practice Statement.
