Representation:
For the claimant: Ms C Charlton, instructed by Bhogal Partners Solicitors
For the appellant:     Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Harjinder Singh, date of birth 1.7.86, is  a  citizen  of
    India.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Narayan promulgated  23.12.14,  allowing,  on
    Article  8  ECHR  grounds  only,  the  claimant's  appeal  against  the
    decisions of the  Secretary  of  State,  dated  5.2.14  to  refuse  his
    application made on 31.1.12 for leave to remain (LTR) in the  UK  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student migrant, pursuant to the Points  Based  System
    (PBS) of the Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard the appeal on 5.12.14.



 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    19.2.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 23.7.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Narayan should be set aside.

 6. The appellant entered the UK in January 2010 and  subsequently  granted
    LTR as a Tier 1 Post Study worker to February 2012. That same month  he
    made his in time application for LTR as a Tier 4 Student. Subsequent to
    his application, in October 2013, he married a British citizen.

 7. There was no dispute in the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing that the
    appeal could not succeed under the Immigration Rules, but Judge Narayan
    allowed the appeal outside the Rules  on  human  rights  grounds  under
    Article 8 ECHR on the basis of the claimant's marriage. At �32  of  the
    decision, Judge Narayan stated, "I find although it is a  matter  which
    is finely balanced that it is not proportionate to enforce  immigration
    control because it  would  in  fact  be  gravely  detrimental  to  this
    appellant and his spouse and would not serve any useful  purpose  apart
    from the argument which is that the appellant would have to go back  to
    India and make an application and so in effect not queue-jump.  I  find
    that the appellant's impeccable immigration history and his industrious
    life in the UK and the fact that it cannot be reasonably expected  that
    his spouse relocate to India bearing in mind her family and job in  the
    UK that the respondent's decision  is  not  proportionate  in  all  the
    circumstances of this case. I therefore find this appeal stands  to  be
    allowed under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights."

 8. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Nicholson noted that at �28 the
    First-tier Tribunal found the claimant's  immigration  status  was  not
    precarious at the time of his marriage, because he married  before  the
    refusal of his application. However, the claimant's immigration  status
    was precarious, as was confirmed in AM (S117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT  0260
    (IAC), because a person's immigration status  is  precarious  if  their
    continued presence in the UK will be dependent upon their  obtaining  a
    further grant of leave.

 9. Whilst section 117B of the 2002 Act only requires  the  judge  to  give
    limited weight to the claimant's relationship if it was entered into at
    a time when the claimant was present illegally, nevertheless if it  was
    entered into at a time when his immigration status was precarious, that
    is a  relevant  factor  in  any  Article  8  proportionality  balancing
    exercise. At the time the claimant  married  he  had  only  section  3C
    leave, having made an application  under  the  Immigration  Rules  that
    could not possibly succeed. The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  erred  in
    concluding that his status was not precarious.

10. Further,  the  judge  gave  credit  in  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise to the claimant's "impeccable immigration history,"  the  fact
    that he speaks fluent English, and that he has  been  working  legally.
    However, the claimant can obtain no positive right to a grant of  leave
    to remain from section 117B, whatever the  degree  of  his  fluency  in
    English, or indeed the strength of  his  financial  resources.  Neither
    does the fact that he complied with immigration control, no  more  than
    he was expected and required to do, increase the weight of his  private
    and family circumstances in the balance against  the  public  interest.
    The judge also failed to take into account that immigration control  is
    deemed to be in the public interest by virtue of section 117B.

11. I also note that before going on to address Article 8 ECHR,  the  judge
    did not consider whether the private and family life  circumstances  of
    the claimant were so compelling and insufficiently  recognised  in  the
    Immigration Rules so as to render the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State unjustifiably harsh so as to require, exceptionally,  the  appeal
    to be allowed under Article 8 ECHR. In MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013]  EWCA
    Civ 1192, the Court of Appeal held  that  in  relation  to  deportation
    cases the 'new' Immigration Rules are a complete code but  involve  the
    application of a proportionality test. Whether that is done within  the
    new rules or outside the new rules as part of the Article 8 general law
    was described as a sterile question, as either way the result should be
    the same; what matters is that proportionality  balancing  exercise  is
    required to  be  carried  out.  However,  if  the  Rules  have  already
    adequately addressed the private and family life  circumstances,  there
    is no purpose in doing so again under Article 8 ECHR.

12. This approach has subsequently been endorsed by the Court of Appeal  in
    Singh v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74, and again in SSHD v SS (Congo)  &  Ors
    [2015] EWCA Civ 387, promulgated after  the  date  of  Judge  Narayan's
    decision, where the Court of Appeal held that it is clear  that  whilst
    the assessment of Article 8 claims requires a two-stage  analysis,  and
    there is no threshold or intermediary requirement of arguability before
    a decision maker moves to  consider  the  second  stage,  whether  that
    second stage is required will depend on whether  all  the  issues  have
    been adequately addressed under the Rules. In other words, there is  no
    need to conduct a full separate examination of Article  8  outside  the
    Rules where in the circumstances of a particular case, all issues  have
    been addressed in the consideration  under  the  Rules.   The  Tribunal
    failed to identify what compelling  circumstances  were  insufficiently
    provided for in the Immigration Rules and why those circumstances would
    render the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer unjustifiably harsh.



13. As clarity on this issue  was  not  available  at  the  time  of  Judge
    Narayan's decision, it was not an error of law to go on in any event to
    make an Article 8 ECHR assessment. However, for  the  reasons  set  out
    herein, that assessment was flawed and amounts to an error of law.

14. With regard to the judge's reference to whether  it  was  proportionate
    that the claimant should return  to  India  to  make  a  partner  entry
    clearance application, this is not a Chikwamba situation. The  claimant
    failed to meet the requirements of Appendix FM for leave to  remain  in
    the UK and it is by no means clear that any  application  from  outside
    the UK could succeed. Whilst the claimant could not meet the Rules, one
    might have expected the judge to consider the  test  that  is  provided
    within the Rules, namely whether there are insurmountable obstacles  to
    continuing family life outside the UK, defined in EX1 and EX2  as  very
    significant difficulties which could not be  overcome  or  which  would
    entail very serious hardship. Or, under paragraph 276ADE, the  test  of
    very significant obstacles to the claimant's integration in India.

15. Both parties agreed that no further evidence was necessary and  that  I
    could proceed to remake the decision without the need for  any  further
    hearing. Having indicated to the parties that I found that the decision
    was in  error  of  law  and  had  to  be  set  aside,  I  offered  each
    representative the opportunity. However, both agreed that they had said
    all that they could in their respective submissions.

16. In remaking the decision, I take account of all the evidence now in the
    papers before me and drawn to my attention by the respective bundles of
    the parties, including the appellant's 353-page bundle of objective and
    subjective  material  whether  or  not  specifically  referred  to.  In
    particular,  I  have  carefully  considered  the   claimant's   witness
    statement of 29.9.14 the undated witness statement  of  Kiranjeet  Kaur
    Chahal, the  claimant's  wife,  and  the  letter  before  claim,  dated
    31.3.13.

17. Whilst there was no proportionality assessment  under  Appendix  FM  or
    paragraph 276ADE, as stated above, the tests under the Rules,  designed
    from 2012 to be the Secretary of State's response to private and family
    life claims are relevant. Under EX1 as defined under EX2, the  claimant
    would have to show insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  with  his
    spouse continuing in India. That she has employment and family  members
    in the UK and does not want to relocate to India does  not  demonstrate
    insurmountable obstacles or significant difficulties they would face in
    continuing family life together outside the UK and which could  not  be
    overcome or would entail very serious  hardship  for  either  of  them.
    Neither does the fact that she does not like the heat or was ill  after
    visiting on two previous occasions. There is  no  medical  evidence  to
    demonstrate that living in India would entail very serious hardship.

18. Similarly, in relation to private life,  I  have  first  to  take  into
    account that as his  status  has  been  precarious  throughout,  little
    weight should be given to any private life the claimant  has  developed
    whilst in the UK. As far as his wife's private life is concerned, as  a
    British citizen she is not required to leave the UK and it will be  her
    choice whether to do so in order to continue family life. In any event,
    I am not satisfied that even applied to either of them that  they  have
    demonstrated  anything  which  could  be  properly  described  as  very
    significant obstacles. Although born in the UK she  has  visited  India
    and has family there, and has evidently  been  raised  with  an  Indian
    cultural background amongst an extended family in the UK.

19. Having considered all the evidence in the round, taken together, I find
    that there are no compelling circumstances in this case that would  not
    have been considered within  the  Immigration  Rules  for  private  and
    family life, such that the decision of the Secretary of State would  be
    unjustifiably harsh. However, as there was no such consideration by the
    Secretary of State and it is clear that the Rules  could  not  be  met,
    there has therefore been no proportionality balancing exercise and thus
    it is not inappropriate to do so  under  Article  8  ECHR  private  and
    family life, taking account of  section  117B  of  the  2002  Act  that
    immigration control is deemed to be in the public interest.

20. That the claimant cannot  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, for the reasons obvious from  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, is highly relevant to any Razgar  Article  8  proportionality
    assessment.

21. I note from the claimant's witness statement that he has  been  looking
    for professional jobs and wants to start his own business. However,  he
    now  works  as  a  railway  engineer.  He  has  completed  a   MSc   in
    international business and management, which will  stand  him  in  good
    stead, together with his lengthy experience  in  the  UK,  in  the  job
    market on return to India.

22. I take into account that Ms Chahal is a British citizen born in the  UK
    and that the majority of her family are in the UK.  However,  when  she
    met the claimant his immigration status was  precarious  and  she  knew
    that he was here on a temporary basis as a student. He  and  she  could
    have had no legitimate expectation of being able to remain  in  the  UK
    except by meeting the requirements for further leave to remain, and  in
    the event had only 3C leave, pending the outcome of an application that
    in fact could not possibly succeed and in respect of which the decision
    was awaited. He could have  withdrawn  that  application  and  made  an
    application for leave to remain on the basis of being the partner of  a
    British citizen under Appendix FM, but did not do so, evidently because
    he could not meet those requirements either.

23. Article 8 is not a shortcut to compliance with  Immigration  Rules  and
    the parties are not entitled to settle together in the UK just  because
    that is their desire or choice. In the circumstances, I find that, when
    conducting the Razgar balancing exercise between on the  one  hand  the
    rights of the claimant and  his  wife  and  on  the  other  the  public
    interest in the legitimate and necessary aim to  protect  the  economic
    well-being of the UK through immigration control, little weight  should
    be accorded to the relationship entered into in full knowledge  of  his
    precarious status. As stated  above,  that  he  speaks  English  or  is
    gainfully employed, or has complied with immigration  control  are  not
    matters that can be placed in the balance against the public  interest,
    as confirmed in AM (S117B) Malawi.

24. In SS (Congo), after reviewing the authorities,  the  Court  of  Appeal
    stated, "It is clear, therefore, that it  cannot  be  maintained  as  a
    general proposition that LTR  or  LTE  outside  the  Immigration  Rules
    should only be  granted  in  exceptional  cases.  However,  in  certain
    specific contexts, a proper application of Article 8 may itself make it
    clear that the legal test for grant of LTR or  LTE  outside  the  Rules
    should indeed be a test of exceptionality. This has now been identified
    to be the case, on the basis of the constant jurisprudence of the ECtHR
    itself, in relation to applications for LTR outside the  Rules  on  the
    basis of family life (where no children are  involved)  established  in
    the United Kingdom at a time when the presence of one or other  of  the
    partners was known to  be  precarious:  see  Nagre,  paras.  [38]-[43],
    approved by this court in MF (Nigeria) at [41]-[42]."

25. This claimant's case is one that meets the above  circumstances.  There
    are no children involved and the presence of the claimant was known  to
    be precarious when the relationship  and  then  marriage  were  entered
    into.

26. Putting all these matters together in the round with the evidence taken
    as a whole, I find that the decision of the Secretary of State  is  not
    disproportionate to the rights of the claimant and  his  wife,  but  is
    entirely proportionate. Neither do I find  the  decision  unjustifiably
    harsh and consider that if she wishes to pursue family  life  with  the
    claimant, it would not be unreasonable to expect the claimant's wife to
    relocate with him to India, on the basis that there is no  evidence  to
    demonstrate that there are insurmountable obstacles to doing so.

Conclusions:

27. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                       I set aside the decision.

                  I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing  it  on
                  both immigration and human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.



Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
