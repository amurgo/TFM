Representation
For the appellant:     Ms R Baruah, Counsel instructed by White Ryland
For the respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan  who  claims  to  have  been
      born on 9 January 1986 and who arrived in the  United  Kingdom  on  27
      September 2002, claiming asylum on the day of his arrival.   Beyond  a
      screening form there was no knowledge on the part of the Secretary  of
      State until after his decision of the basis  on  which  the  appellant
      made that claim.  It was refused for the reasons set out in  a  letter
      dated 8 May 2003 and on 13 May 2003  the  Secretary  of  State  issued
      notice of his decision to remove the appellant to  Afghanistan  as  an
      illegal entrant.  The appellant appealed against the decision on  both
      asylum and human rights grounds.

2.    On 9 July 2003 the Immigration Appellate Authority  issued  notice  to
      the appellant and to his solicitors of  the  first  hearing  and  full
      hearing which stated that the first hearing would  take  place  on  29
      July 2003, followed by a full hearing on 11  September  2003  provided
      that either the appellant or his representatives returned the form  of
      Reply to directions to the Authority before Friday  18  July  2003  or
      that  he  or  they  attended  at  the  first  hearing.    The   notice
      specifically stated that failure to attend the first hearing without a
      satisfactory explanation or to return the Reply  to  directions  would
      lead to a determination of the appeal in the  appellant's  absence  at
      the first hearing.

3.    What in fact happened was that the  appellant's  solicitors  neglected
      to comply with the direction in relation to the filing  of  the  Reply
      timeously. They did not send it to the Authority until 25 July, only a
      day or so prior to the hearing, and in consequence it  did  not  reach
      the file so that the Adjudicator was unaware of it.  It  is  right  to
      say, however, that there is a claim made by the solicitor who has  the
      conduct of this appeal on behalf of the appellant that on 28 July  the
      Authority itself telephoned and spoke to her when she  confirmed  that
      copies of the reply had been sent by facsimile as stated above and was
      told that this information would be linked with the file, as well as a
      note that the appellant was ready to proceed.  Had  it  not  been  for
      that telephone conversation the appellant  would  have  been  in  some
      considerable difficulties before us because  the  Adjudicator  at  the
      first hearing, in the absence of any knowledge of  the  submission  of
      the Reply form  duly  completed  or  of  any  appearance  before  him,
      dismissed the appeal without consideration of its merits.  The  appeal
      to this Tribunal arises from that decision of the Adjudicator, Mr J  R
      A Hanratty.

4.    Ms Holmes for the Secretary of State very fairly  said  that  she  did
      not wish to see the appellant himself disadvantaged but that it was  a
      matter of considerable concern to her that failures on the part of the
      appellant's solicitors to comply with clear directions which had  been
      issued had resulted in the necessity of an appeal to this Tribunal and
      the consequent waste of time and expense.  We agree  fully  with  that
      sentiment.  It is compounded to our mind by the terms of  the  grounds
      of appeal which, at paragraph 3, say:

           "...  However,  it  is  a  well-established  practice  that  the
           Immigration Appellate Authority accepts the completed notice  of
           hearing after that date so long as it is sent in time to link to
           the file.  In practice this has included replies  sent  the  day
           before and also the morning of the first  hearing  in  the  case
           when the first hearing is listed for the afternoon."

      We make it clear that those grounds of  appeal  were  not  settled  by
      counsel but by the solicitor concerned.  They show to our mind a  most
      regrettable approach on the part of the  solicitors  to  their  duties
      both to their client and to the Immigration Appellate  Authority.   If
      there is any general belief that time limits can simply be ignored  in
      the way that they assert, then that is a belief that we should correct
      by this determination.  It may be that if an out-of-time  Reply  comes
      to the attention of an Adjudicator he or she may be prepared  to  take
      its receipt into account: but representatives cannot rely  on  such  a
      course being followed and it is their duty to their client  to  attend
      in  person  in  such  circumstances.  It  is   wholly   improper   for
      representatives of asylum applicants to rely on the  goodwill  of  the
      Immigration Appellate Authority and to ignore clear  directions  which
      are issued for the purposes of ensuring that matters are dealt with as
      quickly  as  possible,  which  is  a  vital   consideration   in   the
      administration   of   the   asylum   appeal    process.    Appellants'
      representatives must take due notice of Rule 44(1) of the  Immigration
      and Asylum Appeals (Procedure)  Rules  2003  which  requires  that  an
      Adjudicator must hear an appeal in the  absence  of  a  party  or  his
      representative if satisfied that due notice of the  hearing  has  been
      served and  he  has  received  no  satisfactory  explanation  for  his
      absence. Where there is sufficient evidence before the Adjudicator  to
      enable him to determine the appeal, an unsuccessful Appellant may face
      real difficulty in obtaining permission to appeal against  a  decision
      reached in the absence of an Appellant who  or  whose  representatives
      have neglected to comply with directions issued to him.

5.    Having failed to submit the Reply timeously it was  the  duty  of  the
      representatives to attend at the first hearing or to ensure  that  the
      appellant did so.   There  can  be  no  criticism  whatsoever  of  the
      Adjudicator for having taken the view  that  on  the  basis  of  those
      directions the proper course was for the appeal to  be  determined  in
      the absence of the appellant.  It may be, as there was  some  material
      relevant to the appellant's case disclosed in the grounds  of  appeal,
      that it would have been better had he dealt with it  substantively  on
      the basis of the evidence before  him  following  the  advice  of  the
      Tribunal in Mohamed (01/TH/1233) but that does not affect in  any  way
      the fact that it was his duty to determine the  appeal  at  the  first
      hearing in view of the blatant failure to comply with  the  directions
      which had been issued.

6.    On behalf of the appellant's representatives, Ms Baruah  has  said  to
      us that they carry out a heavy  workload  of  asylum  and  immigration
      appeals and that this is very much an exception to the  way  in  which
      they would normally handle such matters. We trust that that is so  and
      that they will take the view  that  no  part  of  the  cost  of  these
      proceedings before us should fall either upon the public purse or upon
      the appellant personally.  Nevertheless, we are satisfied that in  the
      interests of justice it  is  appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  for
      hearing afresh.  We accept that it is not the fault of  the  appellant
      and it does not appear to us on the full documentation which  has  now
      been submitted that his claim can be categorised as unarguable.  Since
      there has been no consideration at all of the merits to date, that  is
      a task which remains to be done.

7.    For the above reasons this appeal is allowed to the extent that it  is
      remitted for hearing afresh before an Adjudicator other than Mr J R  A
      Hanratty.

8.        This  determination  is  being  reported  in  order  to  draw  the
      attention of immigration and asylum practitioners to what we have said
       in paragraphs 4 and 5 above.
