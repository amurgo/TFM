                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant is an Afghan National and was born on 17 August 1992.

 2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Kimnell ("the judge"), promulgated on 9  July  2019,  in
    which he dismissed the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
    refusal, dated 26 March 2019, of his human  rights  claim  made  on  20
    September 2018.

 3. The Appellant's claim is predicated upon Article 8 ECHR  ("Article  8")
    and essentially runs as follows. In light of  immigration  history  and
    the fact that has over the course of time, and continues to,  care  for
    his parents, both of whom require assistance with  personal  care,  the
    Appellant enjoys family life with his mother and father,  and,  in  all
    the circumstances, his removal from this  country  would  constitute  a
    disproportionate interference with that family life.

 4. The immigration history alluded to above can be summarised thus. Having
    been  granted  entry  clearance  pursuant  to  paragraph  301  of   the
    Immigration Rules ("the Rules"), the Appellant and his  mother  arrived
    in the United Kingdom beginning of 2013 to join his father. The  father
    had been here for some years previously, having been  recognised  as  a
    refugee and then subsequently obtaining British  citizenship.  Although
    the Appellant arrived in this country as an adult, the entry  clearance
    applications for him and his mother had been made back in 2007 when  he
    was still a child. The exceptional delay between the  applications  and
    arrival here was caused by protracted litigation: following an  initial
    refusal, the appellate proceedings reached the Court of  Appeal  before
    the cases were remitted, with successful outcomes in the Upper Tribunal
    following in June 2012.

 5. Following in-time extension applications, the Appellant and his  mother
    were granted further leave to remain, running from 10 April 2015  until
    10 April 2017. The Applicant's grant was made pursuant to paras 301 and
    302 of the Rules, notwithstanding the fact that he was an adult.  On  6
    April 2017, the Appellant made an in-time  application  for  indefinite
    leave to remain as the child of a person present  and  settled  in  the
    United Kingdom, namely his father. That application was  refused  on  7
    November 2017, on the basis that false representation  been  made:  the
    Applicant had failed to disclose a police caution given  to  him  on  6
    April 2017. It was also said that his removal from the  United  Kingdom
    would not violate Article 8.  On  appeal  to  the  First-Tier  Tribunal
    (HU/15390/2017, promulgated on 6 September 2018), Judge Greasley  found
    that the Appellant acted dishonestly in failing to disclose the  police
    caution in the application for indefinite leave to remain. Further,  it
    was concluded that the Appellant's  parents  could  receive  assistance
    from the NHS and/or social sciences, and that a sister would have  been
    able to provide support as well. It was said that there  were  no  very
    significant obstacles to  the  Appellant's  reintegration  into  Afghan
    society. In all circumstances, the appeal was dismissed.

 6. On 20 September 2018, within the period during which an  onward  appeal
    could have been pursued and within the 14-day "grace  period"  provided
    for in the Rules, the Applicant made an application for leave to remain
    which was treated by the  Respondent  as  a  human  rights  claim,  the
    refusal of which gave rise to a right of appeal under section 82 of the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, as amended ("NIAA 2002").




The judge's decision

 7. Having quite properly referred to the decision of Judge  Greasley,  the
    judge goes on to consider relevant medical  evidence  relating  to  the
    Appellant's parents (to which we will refer later in our decision).  At
    [32] the judge finds that there was family life between  the  Appellant
    and his parents, accepting that the degree of dependency of the parents
    upon their son went beyond "normal  emotional  ties".  The  judge  also
    found that the Appellant enjoyed private life in the United Kingdom. At
    [35] the judge deals with the issue of para 301 of the Rules summarily,
    stating that the point was not argued at the hearing and did not appear
    in the Appellant's skeleton  argument.  In  any  event,  concluded  the
    judge, as the parents were dependent upon the Appellant rather than the
    other way round, this provision of the Rules could  not  be  satisfied.
    Further, he essentially agreed with the conclusions of Judge  Greasley,
    finding  that  there  would  be  no  very  significant   obstacles   to
    reintegration  into  Afghan  society,  with  reference   to   paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules.

 8. In considering the Appellant's Article 8 claim on a  wider  basis,  the
    judge attached "little weight" to the previous failure to disclose  the
    police caution in the 2017 application for indefinite leave to  remain.
    Other factors relating to the Appellant's private life  are  considered
    in [41] - [48], and in  [49]  the  judge  took  into  account  what  he
    described as "a margin of appreciation" on the Respondent's side of the
    balance sheet. The appeal was duly dismissed.




The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 9. The grounds essentially put forward three bases  of  challenge:  first,
    that the judge failed to adequately consider the question of  para  301
    of the Rules and its relevance to  the  Appellant's  Article  8  claim;
    second, that the judge failed to take account of all  relevant  factors
    when  assessing  para  276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the  Rules;  third,  that  in
    considering the wider Article 8 claim, the judge failed to take account
    of all relevant aspects of the Appellant's immigration history  in  the
    context of family life, as opposed to simply private life. Within  this
    third limb of challenge, a point is made about the inappropriateness of
    according the Respondent "a margin of appreciation".

10. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Pickup  on  17
    October 2019.

11. The Respondent has not provided a rule 24 response in this case.



The hearing

12. Having heard Mr Jorro's submissions  (which  followed  the  grounds  of
    appeal, with some  expansion  upon  the  immigration  history  and  the
    relevance of paras 301 and 302 of the Rules), Mr Walker  accepted  that
    the judge had materially erred in law. This concession was made on  the
    basis of a failure to have considered the Appellant's Article  8  claim
    adequately in the context of the accepted family life and in  light  of
    the relevant immigration history.



Decision on error of law

13. There is no good reason for us to go behind Mr Walker's concession.  We
    agree that the judge did fail to consider the Appellant's case in light
    of what can fairly be described  as  the  two  central  planks  of  the
    Article 8 claim, namely the family life with the parents, together with
    the overall immigration history.

14. The judge was also wrong to have factored in "a margin of appreciation"
    to  the  balancing  exercise.  That  is  a  concept  relevant  to   the
    jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and doES  not  play
    an additional role on the domestic front, given that the Respondent  is
    already entitled  to  rely  on  the  overarching  public  interest  (as
    provided for by section 117B(1) NIAA 2002) and the significance  to  be
    attached to the relevant Rules. Whilst there is an error here, it is in
    reality a subsidiary point.

15. In all the circumstances, we  exercise  our  discretion  under  section
    12(2)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and set  the
    judge's decision aside.



Remaking the decision

16. Having canvassed the issue of disposal with the  representatives,  both
    were agreed that we could and should remake the decision in this appeal
    based  upon  the  evidence  before  us.  That  evidence  comprises  the
    Appellant's bundle before the First-tier Tribunal, a letter from the St
    Margaret's Medical Practice, dated 11 June 2019, and  the  Respondent's
    bundle, under cover of letter dated 24 May 2019.



The relevant Rules

17. We set out only paras 301 and 302 of the Rules here,  as  they  play  a
    material particular in our considerations. These provide as follows:

           "Requirements for limited leave to enter or remain in the United
           Kingdom with a view to settlement as the child of  a  parent  or
           parents given limited leave to enter or  remain  in  the  United
           Kingdom with a view to settlement

           301. The requirements to be met  by  a  person  seeking  limited

           paragraph 319R; and

           (v) (where an application is made for limited  leave  to  remain

           with a view to settlement may  be  admitted  for  a  period  not
           exceeding 27 months provided he is able, on arrival, to  produce
           to the Immigration Officer a valid passport  or  other  identity
           document and the applicant has entry clearance for entry in this
           capacity. A person seeking limited leave to remain in the United
           Kingdom with a view to settlement as the child of  a  parent  or

           Kingdom with a view to settlement may be given limited leave  to
           remain for  a  period  not  exceeding  27  months  provided  the
           Secretary of State is satisfied that each of the requirements of
           paragraph 301 (i)-(v) is met."



The parties' submissions

18. Mr Walker had no further submissions to make. He  was  content  not  to
    seek any further information in respect of the Appellant's  immigration
    history, in particular the basis upon which leave to  remain  had  been
    granted in 2015.

19. As announced in open court, and in light of Mr  Walker's  position,  we
    indicated that we  were  minded  to  proceed  on  the  basis  that  the
    Respondent had taken  a  conscious  decision  to  waive  at  least  one
    requirement of the Rules when granting leave in 2015.

20. For his part, Mr Jorro effectively relied on the  submissions  made  in
    respect of the error of law issue. We shall deal with relevant  aspects
    of these when setting out our conclusions and reasons, below.

Findings of fact

21. As matters now stand, there is  little,  if  any,  dispute  as  to  the
    underlying  material  factual  matrix  in  this  case.  We  adopt   the
    immigration history summarised  in  paras  4-6,  above.  We  expand  on
    certain points arising therefrom. First, the Appellant arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom aged 20.  Whilst  on  the  face  of  the  relevant  Rule
    (namely, para 301 - there is no dispute that this  was  the  applicable
    provision), it appears  as  though  he  could  not  have  met  the  age
    criterion under para 301(ii), it is to be  remembered  that  the  entry
    clearance application had been made way back in 2007, when he was still
    a minor. Thus, para 27 of the  Rules  applied  and  the  attainment  of
    majority by the time of the grant of entry clearance  in  2012  was  no
    bar. Second, we find  as  a  fact  that  when  granting  the  extension
    application on 10 April 2015, the Respondent took a deliberate decision
    to waive the age requirement under para 301(ii): the Applicant  was  at
    that time  22  years  old.  Third,  we  find  that  when  refusing  the
    Appellant's indefinite  leave  to  remain  application  in  2017,  with
    reference to para 298 of the Rules, the Respondent relied on  the  fact
    that his mother was being refused at the same time and that  there  had
    been a failure to disclose a material fact, namely the police  caution.
    In the absence of cogent evidence on the point from the Appellant,  and
    in line with findings of Judge Greasley and the  well-known  Devaseelan
    principles, we too find that the Appellant  did  deliberately  fail  to
    disclose the police  caution,  and  that  para  322(1A)  of  the  Rules
    applied. Having said that, it is of note that when refusing the  latest
    application for leave to remain, the Respondent did not rely on the non-
    disclosure issue. Indeed, under the sub-heading  "Suitability",  it  is
    expressly stated that the application  did  not  fall  for  refusal  on
    grounds of suitability, with reference to section S-LTR of Appendix  FM
    to the Rules.

22. On the evidence before us, and in view  of  the  Respondent's  position
    taken thereon, we find that aside from the non-disclosure issue,  there
    has been no other material misconduct by the Appellant  in  respect  of
    his immigration history. There has been no specific  challenge  to  his
    written evidence, that of his parents, and the  supporting  independent
    medical evidence, specifically that emanating from Dr  Marzio  Ascione,
    Consultant Clinical Psychologist, dated 10 June 2019, and the GP letter
    of 11 June 2019. In all the circumstances, we find this evidence to  be
    reliable.

23. We find, as did Judge Greasley,  that  the  parents'  medical  problems
    largely pre-dated their arrival  in  the  United  Kingdom  (the  father
    having come in 1999, and the mother having accompanied the Appellant in
    2013). On the basis of the medical evidence, we find  that  the  father
    suffers from significant mobility and lower back problems, in  addition
    to Type II diabetes, asthma, and depression and anxiety. We  find  that
    the mother suffers from severe depression and  anxiety,  together  with
    memory  loss,  ischaemic  heart  disease,  and  Addison's  Disease   (a
    condition affecting the adrenal glands, often resulting in fatigue  and
    low mood). We  also  find  that  the  Appellant  himself  suffers  from
    depression and anxiety, albeit not at a particularly significant level.
    In this  last  respect,  the  evidence  before  us  differs  from  that
    considered by Judge Greasley in August 2018. Thus, our finding  on  the
    Appellant's current  health  is  not  inconsistent  with  the  previous
    finding that he was "fit" (to the extent that this term was being  used
    by Judge Greasley to indicate overall good health).

24. On the basis of the reliable evidence contained in  the  report  of  Dr
    Ascione, the GP letter, and the witness statements from  the  Appellant
    and his parents, we find that the latter have, for  the  period  during
    which the Appellant has resided in the  United  Kingdom  and  to  date,
    required care with personal functions such as dressing, washing, and to
    an extent toileting. In addition, they  also  require  assistance  with
    housework and getting out and about in a  meaningful  sense.  There  is
    limited  evidence  in  the  Appellant's  bundle  about   the   father's
    entitlement to disability benefits. On the face of it, he has  been  in
    receipt  of  Employment  Support  Allowance,  with  the  Support  Group
    allocation. This is consistent with significant functional limitations.

25. We find that it is the Appellant,  and  the  Appellant  alone,  who  is
    providing the care to his parents. We are inclined to  agree  with  the
    view expressed by Dr Ascione that the Appellant has been  providing  "a
    great deal of support physically and psychologically" to  his  parents.
    The doctor's view, to which we attach considerable weight, is that  the
    parents would "not be  able  to  cope  with  the  complexity  of  their
    physical and psychological needs without the support of their son".  As
    in respect of the Appellant's own health, the medical  evidence  before
    us differs from the fairly brief GP letter considered by Judge Greasley
    in 2018. Our conclusion that the parents' ability to cope  without  the
    Appellant is likely  to  be  significantly  reduced  is  therefore  not
    inconsistent with the previous finding of the First-tier Tribunal.

26. It is the case that the Appellant has a sister living relatively  close
    to the parents'  house.  In  his  2018  decision,  Judge  Greasley  was
    concerned over the absence of evidence from her. Similarly, we have not
    been provided with a statement from this particular  source,  something
    that is less than helpful. On what we do have, we are willing to accept
    that the sister has a family of her own and has not played a meaningful
    role in the care  of  her  parents.  Whilst  we  cannot  rule  out  the
    possibility of this changing in the future, taking the  evidence  as  a
    whole, such an occurrence is in our view unlikely, given  her  lack  of
    involvement thus far, together with what  is  clearly  the  significant
    input required.

27. We find that the  Appellant  had  always  lived  with  his  parents  in
    Afghanistan and continued to live with his mother once the father  left
    that country. The evidence clearly shows that the Appellant has resided
    with both his parents in the United Kingdom throughout his  time  here.
    The Appellant has undertaken employment in this country,  as  evidenced
    by bank statements and payslips. The documentary  evidence  shows  that
    the Appellant's earnings have ranged from approximately �564 a month to
    �921 a month over the course of 2019.

28. We find that the  Appellant  is  unmarried  and  has  never  formed  an
    independent life of his  own.  He  has  been,  and  remains,  at  least
    partially financially  dependent  upon  his  parents,  particularly  in
    respect of essential needs such as accommodation.

29. In light of our findings on the  historical  and  current  relationship
    between the Appellant and his parents, we go on to find that there is a
    very strong bond  between  them  arising  from  the  particular  family
    history (including the father's forced departure from  Afghanistan  and
    the prolonged attempt at a family reunification), and the practical and
    emotional support provided by the former to the latter over the  course
    of years.

30. Finally, although we did not hear the  Appellant  give  oral  evidence,
    having to regard to what is said  in  the  latest  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision, it is clear enough that he speaks  English  to  a  reasonable
    degree. He also speaks Dari.



Conclusions on the Article 8 claim

31. We have no hesitation in concluding that the Appellant enjoys a  strong
    family life with his parents in the United Kingdom. This is in part  on
    the basis of the judge's finding on the issue;  one  which  we  see  no
    reason to  disturb,  particularly  in  light  of  the  absence  of  any
    submission by Mr Walker against the existence of such  a  relationship.
    In  addition,  the  facts,  as  we  have  found  them  to  be,  clearly
    demonstrate that there are ties going  well  beyond  what  is  normally
    expected of an adult child/parental relationship. In our  view,  it  is
    also important to keep well in mind the overall history of  this  case.
    The Appellant had lived with  his  parents  in  Afghanistan.  Once  his
    father was forced to leave, the Appellant continued to reside with  his
    mother. They sought entry to the United Kingdom at the  same  time  and
    had to endure a particularly long legal process before  being  reunited
    with the father. The family unit have lived together ever since.

32. We also find that the Appellant enjoys a private life in this  country,
    established over the course time and with reference to  employment  and
    what we consider to be the likelihood of general social interaction.

33. The consequences of the Respondent's refusal of the  Appellant's  human
    rights  claim  would  be  sufficiently   serious   to   constitute   an
    interference with both his family and private lives. There has been  no
    suggestion to the contrary by the Respondent.

34. The Respondent's decision was clearly in accordance with the law and it
    pursues the legitimate aim of maintaining effective immigration control
    (under the general umbrella of ensuring the economic well-being of  the
    United Kingdom).

35. Thus, the central issue in this appeal is, as in many  cases,  that  of
    proportionality. Inherent in  this  is  the  need  to  strike  a  "fair
    balance" between the protected rights of the Appellant on the one hand,
    and the public interest on the other (see Agyarko [2017]  UKSC  11,  at
    para 60).

36. In undertaking this balancing exercise, we have gained assistance  from
    the distilled guidance set out by the Court of Appeal in GM (Sri Lanka)
    [2019] EWCA Civ 1630, in addition to other well-known authorities  from
    the  higher  courts.  We  also  take  full  account  of  the  mandatory
    considerations set out in sections 117A-117B of the NIAA 2002.

37. We begin with a consideration of the relevant Rules.

38. In our view, para 276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the  Rules  does  not  assist  the
    Appellant. In carrying out  a  broad  evaluative  judgment  as  to  the
    question of reintegration into Afghan society, and  applying  the  high
    threshold denoted by the "very significant obstacles" test, we conclude
    that the Appellant's particular circumstances preclude the satisfaction
    of this provision.  Although  he  does  suffer  from  a  mental  health
    condition, it is not of particular severity. He speaks Dari.  He  lived
    in Afghanistan until 2013 and there is nothing to suggest that  he  has
    discarded all meaningful appreciation of societal and cultural mores of
    that country. No issue of any risk on return has been raised. We see no
    reason  why  the  Appellant  would  not  be  able  to  find  reasonable
    employment of one sort or another. In  summary,  the  Appellant  would,
    within a reasonable timeframe, consider himself and  be  considered  by
    others as an insider, and would  be  able  to  form  sufficiently  good
    social and economic links in his home country.

39. Paras 301 and 302 of the Rules bare greater relevance  in  the  overall
    assessment of the Appellant's circumstances. We remind  ourselves  that
    he was granted entry clearance under para 301. This provision  provides
    for leave to enter or remain "with a view to settlement". The Appellant
    was not only granted entry clearance (following  protracted  litigation
    in which he was successful at first instance, the Court of Appeal,  and
    then again upon remittal), but was  then  granted  an  extension,  once
    again "with a view to settlement",  and  on  the  basis  that  the  age
    criterion  under  paragraph  301  was  deliberately   waived   by   the
    Respondent. The grant also meant that the  Respondent  must  have  been
    satisfied  that  the  Appellant  was  not  at  that  time  leading   an
    independent life.

40. The Rules-based path to  settlement  ended  with  the  refusal  of  the
    application for indefinite leave to  remain  under  para  298  and  the
    subsequent unsuccessful appeal in 2018. The finding  on  dishonesty  at
    that juncture is a matter that  we  take  fully  into  account  in  our
    balancing  exercise.  Having  said  that,  when  refusing  the   latest
    application for leave to remain, the Respondent did not seek to rely on
    the previous dishonesty. Indeed, as mentioned earlier in our  decision,
    there is an express statement that the application did not fall  to  be
    refused on suitability grounds. On the assumption that  the  Respondent
    gave careful consideration to that application, and in the  absence  of
    any specific submissions on the point  from  Mr  Walker,  we  draw  the
    inference that the finding of dishonesty was not deemed to enhance  the
    public interest in this case.

41. The Respondent's reliance on what is said to be the lack of  dependency
    by the Appellant upon his parents is, in our view,  misconceived.  Para
    301 does not contain a dependency criterion. Para  301(iii)  stipulates
    that the individual must not be "leading an independent life",  not  be
    in a formal relationship, and must  not  have  "formed  an  independent
    family unit".  However,  although  the  Appellant  may  not  be  wholly
    financially dependent upon his parents (he has been earning an  income,
    albeit at a fairly low-level), it does not follow that he is  therefore
    "leading an independent  life"  (see,  for  example,  NM  ("leading  an
    independent life") Zimbabwe [2007] UKAIT 00051 and  MI  (Paragraph  298
    (iii): "independent  life")  Pakistan  [2007]  UKAIT  00052).  This  is
    particularly the case given that the appellant has  always  lived  with
    his  parents  and  has  been  dependent  upon  them   in   respect   of
    accommodation at the very least.

42. We conclude that the Appellant has  not  been  leading  an  independent
    life, nor has he formed an independent family unit.  We  also  conclude
    that the Appellant has been adequately accommodated by his parents.

43. There are, however, other criteria under para 301 which  the  Appellant
    cannot meet. First,  he  was  undoubtedly  an  adult  when  the  latest
    application was made. Whereas in the previous extension application the
    Respondent had waived the age  criterion,  this  has  not  occurred  in
    respect of the application with which we  are  now  concerned.  Second,
    para  301(iva)  stipulates  that  an  applicant  must   be   adequately
    maintained "by the parent or parents without recourse to public funds".
    Here, the Appellant has been earning an income of sorts. It  cannot  be
    said that he has been maintained by his  parents  from  their  earnings
    (leaving aside income derived from benefits).

44. There has been no suggestion that the applicant can satisfy any of  the
    provisions under Appendix FM to the Rules.

45. Although not pursued by Mr Jorro before us (and for  good  reason),  we
    note that the  covering  letter  accompanying  the  Appellant's  latest
    application sought to rely on para 197 of the  Rules  as  a  basis  for
    success in the Article 8 claim. This is  misconceived.  That  provision
    relates specifically to the  children  of  a  parent  or  parents  with
    limited leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom under paras 128-
    193.  Those  provisions  are  concerned  with  a  range  of  categories
    including employment, domestic workers, and ministers of religion.  The
    Appellant's parents clearly do not fall into any of those.

46. The upshot of our consideration of  the  Rules  is  that  Appellant  is
    unable to satisfy relevant requirements thereof. It  follows  that  the
    Appellant cannot succeed under Article 8 on  the  basis  that  specific
    provisions of the Rules are favourably determinative of his claim  (see
    TZ (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109).

47. We now proceed to consider the Article 8 claim on a wider  basis,  with
    the focus firmly on the Appellant's family life.

48. The first relevant factor here  is  the  undoubted  importance  of  the
    general public interest in maintaining effective  immigration  control.
    As stated earlier, we do take the Appellant's previous dishonesty  into
    account, but do so in the context of the  Respondent's  express  stance
    that suitability does not play a material particular in this case.

49. The second factor relates  once  more  to  the  Rules.  The  Respondent
    assessed the Appellant's circumstances outside the specific  provisions
    of paras 276ADE and 301-302 of the Rules with reference to "exceptional
    circumstances". This phrase appears in GEN  3.2  of  Appendix  FM,  and
    arguably might represent a codification of Article 8 within  the  Rules
    in certain cases. However, the Appellant's  application  for  leave  to
    remain was not made under Appendix FM, nor is it considered under these
    provisions by the Respondent. Therefore, our wider consideration  takes
    place outwith context of the Rules.

50. The inability to currently meet the Rules is a relevant factor weighing
    against the Appellant. We do, however, take account of the  fact  that,
    at least in respect of paras 301 and 302, that inability  carries  with
    it certain nuances, as set out in paras 39-42, above.  Furthermore,  in
    the previous extension application, the Respondent had waived at  least
    one  criterion  under  para  301.  The  inference  we  draw  from   the
    Respondent's past consideration of  the  Appellant's  circumstances  is
    that she had taken the view  that  there  was  a  genuine  family  unit
    involving inter-dependency, an important element of which  had  clearly
    been the assistance provided by the Appellant to his parents  (both  of
    whom had required assistance at the time of the  extension  application
    in 2015). These considerations go  to  counterweigh,  at  least  to  an
    extent, the adverse impact on the Appellant's claim  arising  from  his
    inability to meet the Rules now.

51. Third, we have found that the Appellant speaks English to a  reasonable
    standard. In consequence, nothing adverse arises from section 117B(2).

52. Fourth, the Appellant has not been relying directly on public funds and
    is "financially independent", as that phrase has  been  interpreted  by
    the Supreme Court in Rhuppiah [2018] UKSC 58.  As  with  the  issue  of
    language, this  consideration  is  of  neutral  value  to  our  overall
    assessment. Even if any indirect reliance on public funds arising  from
    the use of accommodation subsidised by Housing Benefit received by  the
    father was relevant, it would not affect our overall conclusion in this
    appeal.

53. The fifth factor is that  of  the  Appellant's  status  in  the  United
    Kingdom. Focusing as we are on  the  family  life  issue,  the  "little
    weight" considerations under section 117B(4) and (5) do not  come  into
    play (see GM (Sri Lanka), at para 35). In  any  event,  the  particular
    circumstances of this case would lead us to conclude that there  should
    not be a reduction in the  weight  attributable  to  family  life.  The
    Appellant, like his mother,  entered  this  country  "with  a  view  to
    settlement". Similarly, the grant of the extension  in  2015  was  also
    based upon a provision of the Rules which was expressly directed at  "a
    view to settlement". Thus, the Appellant and his  mother  were  on  the
    pathway to settled status and  their  "precariousness"  was  not  of  a
    similar nature to that of, for example, visitors or students.  Further,
    following the unsuccessful appeal  in  2018,  the  Applicant  made  his
    latest application prior to the expiry of the deadline  for  making  an
    onward appeal and within the 14-day  "grace  period"  provided  for  in
    paragraph 39E of the Rules. The appellant has not resided in the United
    Kingdom in breach of immigration law.

54. Sixth, we consider the circumstances of the Appellant's parents. It  is
    quite  clear  that  they  would  be  significantly  affected   by   the
    Appellant's departure from this country. We have found  that  they  are
    heavily reliant upon him for important aspects  of  their  day  to  day
    lives. We have also found that they have a strong emotional  bond  with
    their son and that their daughter would be unlikely to provide anything
    approaching a relatively similar level of  assistance  (if  indeed  she
    would provide any at all).

55. In the reasons for refusal letter, the Respondent suggests that one  or
    both of the parents could  receive  support  from  the  NHS  or  social
    services. A similar point was made by the  First-tier  Tribunal.  As  a
    simple matter of fact, the parents are entitled to  NHS  treatment  and
    would, depending on the outcome of appropriate assessments, probably be
    able to receive certain assistance from social services. On the face of
    it, this is a factor weighing in the Respondent's favour in  the  sense
    that the Appellant's departure from the United Kingdom would not  leave
    the parents without any form of practical assistance whatsoever.

56. Having said that, Mr Walker has not emphasised this point, nor  has  he
    sought to argue against the significance attached by Mr  Jorro  to  the
    emotional aspect of the relationship  between  the  Appellant  and  his
    parents. Two additional considerations come into play here.  The  first
    is that the  Appellant's  presence  in  this  country  is,  on  a  very
    practical level, in fact avoiding (or at least mitigating) a burden  on
    the public purse. But for his  day  to  day  care,  the  parents  would
    inevitably need relatively significant input from social  services,  at
    an obvious cost to its budget. Applying a common-sense approach, it  is
    highly  unlikely  that  any  social  services  input  would  be  at  an
    equivalent (or near-equivalent) level of assistance to  that  currently
    provided by the Appellant. In turn, there  is  a  distinct  possibility
    that the parents would  then  require  additional  NHS  services,  with
    consequent financial implications.

57. The second consideration is our conclusion that the parents could  not,
    on any view, be able  to  return  to  Afghanistan  with  the  Appellant
    without  experiencing  unjustifiably  harsh  consequences.  Both   have
    significant health problems, and the father is a  British  citizen  and
    has resided in this country for  close  to  two  decades.  Neither  the
    reasons for refusal letter nor Mr Walker have suggested  that  a  joint
    return to Afghanistan should  be  contemplated.  It  follows  that  the
    Appellant's departure from the United Kingdom would entail a separation
    of the family unit and the effective rupturing of  both  emotional  and
    practical support. This would have a significant adverse impact on both
    the Appellant and his parents.

58. The combination of these  two  considerations  acts  as  a  significant
    counterweight to the availability of NHS and social services support.

59. Having set out our consideration of the various  relevant  factors,  we
    now bring everything together and state our ultimate conclusion on  the
    question of proportionality.

60. On the particular facts of this case  (which  include  certain  unusual
    features relating to the immigration history such  as  the  waiving  of
    requirements of the Rules and the protracted efforts to achieve  family
    reunification), we  conclude  that  the  Respondent's  refusal  of  the
    Appellant's human rights claim does not strike a fair  balance  between
    the protected family life of the former on the one hand and the  public
    interest on the other. Whilst the margin of success for  the  Appellant
    may not be wide, the cumulative effect of the factors weighing  in  his
    favour are sufficient to tip the scales. In summary form:

              i. there is a strong family life;




             ii. the weight attributable to that family life is not  reduced
                 simply because the Appellant's status in the United Kingdom
                 has been precarious;




            iii. the inability to meet the Rules, whilst  clearly  relevant,
                 is not as weighty a factor  against  the  Appellant  as  it
                 otherwise might have been, given the specific facts of this
                 case;




             iv. the Appellant plays a very significant role in the  support
                 of his parents and alternative sources of assistance  would
                 not only fail to reach a near-equivalent level,  but  would
                 also be a drain on the public purse;




              v. the parents cannot return to Afghanistan and therefore  the
                 Appellant's departure from the United  Kingdom  will  split
                 the family unit;




             vi. the Appellant's Article 8 claim is sufficiently  strong  in
                 order to succeed, notwithstanding the weighty consideration
                 of the general public interest.

61. It follows from what is said above that the Appellant's appeal falls to
    be allowed.

62. As we have made clear, the focus has been on the family life claim.  In
    respect of the Appellant's private life, we are firmly of the view that
    this cannot succeed. The "precariousness" issue does come into play and
    acts to reduce the weight attributable to that aspect of the Article  8
    claim. The Appellant cannot meet any of the private life-related  Rules
    and there are no additional considerations that mitigate that  failure.
    Finally, there are no other  exceptional  or  compelling  circumstances
    present.

Anonymity


63. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction. We see no
    reason to make such a direction at this stage, and we do not do so.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

We set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

We re-make the decision by allowing the Appellant's  appeal  on  the  ground
that the Respondent's refusal of his human rights claim was  unlawful  under
section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, with reference to Article 8 ECHR.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As we have allowed the appeal  and  because  a  fee  has  been  paid  or  is
payable, we have considered making a fee award and have decided  to  make  a
reduced fee award of �100. We  have  reduced  the  fee  because  though  the
Appellant has succeeded in his appeal, this has not been by  virtue  of  the
primary basis put forward, namely the satisfaction of the relevant Rules.
