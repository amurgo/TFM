For the Respondent:    Mr R Claire instructed by Waterstone Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Although the Secretary of State is the  Appellant  in  this  appeal,  I
    refer to the parties as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant, a national of Bangladesh,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision of the Secretary of State of  16th  October
    2015 refusing his application for indefinite leave to remain in the  UK
    as  the  spouse  of  a  British  citizen.   First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Trevaskis allowed the appeal and the Secretary of State now appeals  to
    this Tribunal with permission granted by Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Roberts on 15th August 2015.

 3. The background to this appeal is that the Appellant entered the  UK  on
    28th July 2007 with leave as a student.  His leave was  extended  on  a
    number of occasions up until August 2013 and on 27th February  2013  he
    was granted leave to remain as the partner  of  a  person  present  and
    settled in the UK  until  27th  February  2015.   His  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain was refused under paragraph  287(a)  of  the
    Immigration Rules with reference to  322(1A)  because  he  submitted  a
    TOEIC certificate from  Educational  Testing  Service  (ETS)  with  his
    application of 24th October 2011 issued on the basis of a test that  he
    took at Synergy Business College, London on 18th October 2011.  In  the
    Reasons for Refusal letter the Secretary of State  said  that  ETS  had
    undertaken a check of the Appellant's test and had  concluded  that  it
    was undertaken by a proxy test taker and was invalid.  On the basis  of
    that information the Secretary of State considered that the certificate
    was fraudulently obtained and refused the  application  for  indefinite
    leave to remain under the general ground in paragraph  322(1A)  of  the
    Immigration Rules and under Appendix FM on  suitability  grounds.   The
    application was also refused under paragraph 276ADE and  the  Secretary
    of State considered there were no exceptional circumstances.

 4. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal the Secretary of  State's
    representative initially applied for an  adjournment  to  seek  further
    evidence.  The judge refused the adjournment but  gave  the  Presenting
    Officer an opportunity to obtain some of  the  missing  evidence.   The
    judge heard oral evidence from the Appellant and his wife.   The  judge
    set out the Respondent's submissions and  the  Appellant's  submissions
    and found that the Appellant was credible and that the test scores  had
    not been obtained by means of fraud or by the use of a proxy. The judge
    concluded  that  the  test  certificates  were  valid  and,  since  the
    Appellant satisfies the other requirements of the Immigration Rules, he
    had demonstrated that he was entitled to indefinite leave to remain  in
    the UK.

 5. The Secretary of State's application for permission to appeal is  based
    on two grounds of appeal. It is contended in the first ground  that  as
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to refer to  the  evidence  before
    him it is not clear that it has been properly considered and  that  the
    judge failed to explain why he found the Appellant credible. The second
    ground contends that the judge made a procedural error in  refusing  to
    grant an adjournment  so  that  the  Presenting  Officer  could  obtain
    further evidence in relation to the ETS test.

 6. Permission to appeal was initially refused in the  First-tier  Tribunal
    but was granted on renewal to the Upper Tribunal on the basis  that  it
    was  arguable  that,  in  refusing  the  Respondent's  request  for  an
    adjournment, the First-tier Tribunal had not given proper consideration
    to material evidence which may affect the outcome of  the  matter.  The
    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge further considered that it was unclear what
    evidence the First-tier Tribunal Judge  considered  in  coming  to  his
    decision.

 7. At the hearing  before  me  Ms  Isherwood  accepted  on  the  basis  of
    paragraphs 9 and 10 of the decision and the copy of the fax that was in
    the bundle that she could not take the second ground any  further.   It
    is clear to me from the note at paragraphs 9 and  10  of  the  decision
    that the Presenting Officer was given an opportunity to obtain  missing
    evidence before the hearing commenced.  The fax from  the  Home  Office
    which was submitted to the judge is on file and it  indicates  that  it
    was received by the First-tier Tribunal at 10:32am on 10th January, the
    day of the hearing.  It contains the following documents:

              . ETS printout in respect of the Appellant.
              . Statement of 10th January 2017 from Timothy Lloyd.
              . Statement dated 23rd June 2014 from Rebecca Collings.
              . Statement dated 23rd June 2014 from Peter Millington.
              . Report of 20th April 2016 by Professor French.
              . A Project Faï¿½ade Report by Synergy Business College.

 8. It is clear from the decision and the fax that this evidence was before
    the judge at the hearing. The Home Office has not asserted  that  there
    was any further evidence  to  be  submitted  had  an  adjournment  been
    granted. Accordingly the Secretary of State has  not  established  that
    the judge committed a procedural error capable  of  making  a  material
    difference to the outcome of the fairness of the proceedings.

 9. The first ground in the  renewal  application  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    contends that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  failed  to  refer  to  the
    evidence and it is not clear that it has been properly considered.   It
    is contended that the First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to  take  proper
    account of this evidence in accepting that the  Appellant  is  credible
    and failed to properly adequately explain why this had been  done.   It
    is contended that had the judge properly  considered  the  Respondent's
    evidence it would have been established on the balance of probabilities
    that the Appellant had practised deception.

10. In her submissions Ms Isherwood contended that the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge had erred at paragraph 23 in taking account  of  the  Appellant's
    proficiency in English at the hearing. She relied on  paragraph  57  of
    the decision in MA (ETS - TOEIC testing) Nigeria [2016] UKUT 450  (IAC)
    where the Tribunal says that there are a range of  reasons  why  people
    proficient in English may engage in TOEIC fraud.  She further submitted
    that the judge failed to properly consider the  evidence  submitted  by
    the Secretary of State.  Although the judge set  out  the  Respondent's
    case at paragraphs 3 to 6 of the decision, in her submission he did not
    show that he had engaged with the Secretary of State's  evidence.   She
    submitted that the judge failed to explain how the evidence had crossed
    the first hurdle set out in the case of SM and  Qadir  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2016] UKUT 229 (IAC). The  guidance  of
    the Upper Tribunal was clarified by the Court of Appeal in SM and Qadir
    (ETS - Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] EWCA Civ 1167.

11. Mr Claire submitted that the judge had relied on the credibility of the
    Appellant in reaching his conclusions and noted that the Appellant  had
    given evidence of English and that he  was  not  asked  any  additional
    questions over and above his  witness  statement  and  was  not  cross-
    examined.  He noted also at paragraph 15 that the Appellant's wife  was
    not asked any questions and was not cross-examined.  Therefore, in  his
    submission, it is  clear  that  the  Appellant's  credibility  was  not
    challenged at the hearing.  Further, Mr Claire referred to paragraph 16
    of the decision where it is noted:

         "The Respondent's representative conceded that the  evidence  which
         was before me was insufficient to shift the burden of proof to  the
         Appellant regarding the allocation of deception in  order  to  pass
         the test.  He invited me to decide  the  appeal  on  the  available
         evidence".

12. He submitted that the judge found in the Appellant's favour because  of
    his general credibility and not only because of the finding in relation
    to the Appellant's proficiency in English.  In his submission the judge
    attached  weight  to  the  substantial  evidence  from  the   Appellant
    detailing the circumstances of his attendance at the  test  centre  and
    the conduct of the test and the judge  concluded  that  he  did  attend
    these tests.  This showed that the proficiency of English was a  factor
    but not the only factor.  He highlighted the decision in the case of  R
    (on the application of Gazi) v SSHD [2015] UKUT 00327  as  set  out  in
    paragraph 19 of the decision which said that the Tribunal  is  entitled
    to take the Appellant's ability to speak English as a factor.

13. Mr Claire referred to paragraphs 54, 56 and 57 of the  decision  in  MA
    where the Tribunal said:


          "(54) At this juncture we switch our  focus  to  the  Appellant's
             evidence to the Tribunal. We heard and observed the  Appellant
             studiously during some 2ï¿½ hours. We scrutinised in  particular
             response times, hesitation, spontaneity  and  engagement  with
             the Tribunal generally. We found  the  Appellant  surprisingly
             hesitant. If he had truly undertaken the tests we  would  have
             expected him to have been much more assured and  assertive  in
             his  evidence.  These  qualities  were,  however,   strikingly
             lacking. We would also have expected  greater  spontaneity  in
             his evidence. In particular, we consider that, if genuine,  he
             would  have  been  anxious  to  disclose,   spontaneously   or
             otherwise, matters of detail relating  to  the  two  days  and
             occasions under scrutiny with  a  view  to  demonstrating  his
             innocence of the charge of deception. This too was  strikingly
             absent from  his  evidence.  Furthermore,  on  occasions,  the
             simplest of questions had to be repeated, sometimes more  than
             once,  a  paradigm  illustration  being  the  quintessentially
             simple, but crucial, question: to where  did  he  travel  from
             Cauldon College on the first occasion, 28 February  2013?  The
             Appellant dealt  with  this  repeated  question  in  a  wholly
             unsatisfactory way.


         (55)    These features of the Appellant's demeanour,  presentation
             and the delivery of his evidence generally must be  considered
             within their contextual  framework  and,  in  particular,  the
             background that the Appellant, prior to giving evidence to the
             Tribunal, had enjoyed ample time for reflection,  recollection
             and preparation. We recognise that a party  or  witness  whose
             evidence  partakes  of  these  characteristics  is  not, ipso
             facto and inexorably, unworthy of belief. However, context is
             everything and we consider  that  in  this  particular  appeal
             these factors, coupled with the  findings  and  considerations
             highlighted above, impel ineluctably to  the  conclusion  that
             the  Appellant's  case  is  a  fabrication  in  all   material
             respects. Finally, we have already highlighted above,  and  do
             not repeat, his unconvincing and implausible  explanations  of
             material discrepancies and inconsistencies canvassed with  him
             in questioning.






             Omnibus Finding and Conclusions


         (56)    We  make  two  concluding  observations.  First,  we  are
             conscious that our assessment of the  Appellant's  credibility
             differs radically from that of the FtT.  While  we  take  this
             into account, we are not of course bound by  another  judicial
             assessment. Furthermore, it is  clear  that  the  content  and
             contours  of  the  appeal  which  we  have  considered  differ
             markedly from those of the first instance appeal.


         (57)    Second, we acknowledge the suggestion that  the  Appellant
             had no reason to engage in the deception which we  have  found
             proven. However, this has not deflected us  in  any  way  from
             reaching our main findings and conclusions. In  the  abstract,
             of course, there is a range of reasons why persons  proficient
             in  English  may  engage  in  TOEIC  fraud.   These   include,
             inexhaustively, lack of confidence, fear of failure, lack  of
             time and commitment and contempt for the  immigration  system.
             These reasons could conceivably overlap  in  individual  cases
             and there  is  scope  for other explanations  for  deceitful
             conduct in this sphere.  We  are  not  required  to  make  the
             further finding of why the Appellant engaged in deception and
             to this we add that this issue was  not  explored  during  the
             hearing. We resist any  temptation  to  speculate  about  this
             discrete matter."

14. Mr Claire referred to paragraph 54 highlighting that in this appeal the
    judge had the benefit of hearing evidence from the  Appellant  and  his
    wife who he said did their best to assist the Tribunal  and  this  went
    into  his  credibility  assessment.  He  submitted  that  there  is  no
    requirement for the  judge  to  refer  to  all  of  the  evidence.   He
    reiterated that the  Secretary  of  State  chose  not  to  dispute  the
    Appellant's evidence by deciding not to cross-examine the Appellant and
    it was unfair to raise a challenge to the Appellant's evidence now.

15. Ms Isherwood in response  submitted  that  she  could  not  comment  on
    paragraph 16 in light of the fact that the guidance  in  SM  and  Qadir
    says  that  the  generic  evidence  is  sufficient  to  discharge   the
    evidential burden.  She argued that the judge erred in that  he  failed
    to  consider  the  Secretary  of  State's  evidence,   considered   the
    Appellant's proficiency in English and failed to address  paragraph  53
    of SM and Qadir which sets out the proper approach to be taken.

Discussion and Conclusions

16. The guidance given by the Upper Tribunal in SM and  Qadir  was  further
    clarified by the Court of Appeal where it was  held  that  the  generic
    evidence is sufficient to meet the evidential burden on  the  Secretary
    of State to raise a doubt such that the evidential burden shifts to the
    Appellant to proffer an  innocent  explanation.  If  he  can  then  the
    Secretary of State may be unable to meet the legal burden of proof.

17. In considering the reasons given by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  for
    his conclusions it is worth remembering the guidance given by the Court
    of Appeal for example in AS (Iran) v SSHD [2017] EWCA  Civ  1539  where
    Irwin LJ said at paragraph 26:

         "In  approaching  criticism  of  reasons  given  by  a   First-tier
         Tribunal,  the  Respondent  correctly  reminds  us   to   avoid   a
         requirement of perfection.  As Brooke LJ observed in the course  of
         his decision in R (Iran) v The Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982, "unjustified complaints" as  to  an
         alleged failure to give adequate reasons are all too frequent.  The
         obligation on a Tribunal is to give reasons in sufficient detail to
         show the principles on which the Tribunal has acted and the reasons
         that have led to the decision.  Such reasons need not be elaborate,
         and do not need to address every argument  or  every  factor  which
         weighed in the decision.  If a Tribunal has not expressly addressed
         an argument, but if there are grounds on which the  argument  could
         properly have been rejected, it should be assumed that the Tribunal
         acted on such grounds.  It is sufficient that the critical  reasons
         to the decision are recorded.  ..."


18. The judge was clearly aware of the approach to be taken in these  cases
    as set out at paragraph 17 in  the  submissions  from  the  Appellant's
    representative and in the section setting out the case law [19 - 21].

19. Whilst it is noted at paragraph 16 that the Presenting Officer conceded
    that Secretary of State had failed to discharge the  evidential  burden
    upon her to enable the burden to shift onto the Appellant, it is  clear
    that the judge must have considered that  the  burden  had  shifted  in
    moving to his assessment of the Appellant's evidence as set out in  his
    findings at paragraphs 22 to 26.

20. The judge took into  account  the  Appellant's  evidence  and  attached
    particular weight to the Appellant's credibility and that of his  wife.
    The judge considered the evidence about the Appellant's  attendance  at
    the test centre and the conduct of the  test  and  concluded  that  the
    Appellant did attend the test centre and take  the  test.   Whilst  the
    judge referred to the Appellant's proficiency in English as a factor at
    paragraph 23 it is clear from his assessment of  all  of  the  evidence
    that  this  was  not  a  determinative  factor.  Whilst  the   Tribunal
    highlighted the dangers of relying on a proficiency  in  English  as  a
    reason why  an  Appellant  might  not  have  engaged  in  deception  at
    paragraph 57 of MA, the judge was entitled to take  this  into  account
    along with all of the other evidence.

21. In my view it is clear that the judge reached findings open to  him  on
    the evidence and the judge was entitled to reach that  finding  on  the
    basis of the evidence before him.
