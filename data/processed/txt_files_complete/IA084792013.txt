Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Z Nasim, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, HOPO


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of India, born on 31 July 1984.  His  appeal
    against the decision of the respondent made  on  28  February  2013  to
    refuse him leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant and to  remove
    him from  the  UK  by  way  of  directions  under  Section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 was  dismissed  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett.

2.   The appellant had claimed 25 points for previous earnings and 5  points
    for UK experience because he claimed earnings of  �40,249  made  up  of
    �18,096.86 from his employment with BP and  from  his  self-employment.
    The respondent took the view that the documents the appellant  provided
    from his accountant confirmed his BP earnings, but the net profit shown
    in the documents from his accountant  was  different  to  that  on  the
    application form.  The respondent was therefore not satisfied that  the
    appellant met the requirements of Appendix A or of  paragraph  245CA(c)
    of HC 395, as amended.

3.   Mr Tufan said that the judge dismissed the appellant's appeal  for  the
    reason given in  paragraph  12  of  the  determination.   For  ease  of
    reference I shall quote that paragraph:

    12.  The appellant did not meet the requirements of the  Rules  because
         the letter from his accountant does not confirm  the  exact  amount
         received by the appellant as net profit from self-employment.   The
         gross  and  net  figures  that  have  been  provided  include   the
         appellant's salaried income whereas the information required by the
         respondent is a breakdown of self-employed earnings.   In  addition
         the letter fails to confirm that the  appellant  actually  received
         the amount he is claiming  or  the  net  profit  to  which  he  was
         entitled as opposed to having merely  submitted  invoices  for  the
         payments.

4.   At paragraph 10 of the judge's decision, she  had  reproduced  relevant
    sections of paragraph 19-SD(a), sub-paragraphs (vi) and (viii) of which
    require an applicant who is claiming points for self-employed  earnings
    to submit a letter from his accountant on headed  paper  by  confirming
    that the applicant received the exact amount he is claiming, or the net
    profit to which he is entitled over the period to be assessed, a profit
    and loss account or income and expenditure account if the  organisation
    is not trading for profits, and a balance sheet signed by  a  director.
    Mr. Tufan said that the judge's conclusion at paragraph 12 was based on
    paragraph 19-SD(a).

5.   It is clear from the appellant's application form at Annex  A  that  at
    A20, he ticked the boxes for the documents he was submitting  with  the
    application.  They were business bank statement  showing  the  payments
    made to him, company/business accounts which  clearly  showed  the  net
    profit of the company, letter from managing agent/accountant confirming
    that he received the exact amount that he  was  claiming,  or  the  net
    profit to which he was entitled and the invoices generated  during  the
    period for which earnings were being claimed.  At question J4 (A17)  he
    claimed earnings for the period 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012.

6.   At A19 he ticked the box for earnings of �40,000 to �49,999, for  which
    he would be given 25 points.  His earnings at BP  were  not  in  issue.
    They were  �18,096.86  for  which  he  submitted  pay  slips  and  bank
    statements.  From his self-employment as an IT consultant,  he  claimed
    earnings of �22,152, for which he submitted invoices,  bank  statements
    and a statement of account from an accountant.  At J6 he claimed  total
    earnings of �40,249, which were made up of his income from BP  and  his
    self-employment.  These were the figures at J5.

7.   The appellant's appeal was determined on the papers by the  judge.   It
    transpired  during  the  hearing  before  me  that   apart   from   the
    accountant's letter, account statements and invoices generated from his
    self-employment, the  appellant's  pay  slips  from  BP  and  his  bank
    statements were not submitted with the respondent's bundle.  This means
    that the judge would not have these documents as I did not  have  them.
    The bank statements would have confirmed payments into his bank account
    from his self-employment.

8.   The judge found as follows:

    6.    The  appellant  included  documents  headed  management  accounts
         prepared by certified accountants which showed his profits for  the
         period to be �40,249. That total was shown  after  adding  together
         his self employment income, given as �24,200,  and  his  employment
         and deducting from the total  various  expenses.  The  accompanying
         letter from  the  accountants  does  not  give  a  figure  for  the
         Appellant's income from  employment  but  states  his  total  gross
         income was �42,296.86 and his net income �40,249.42 with his  self-
         employment income  as  �24,200.   That  is  where  it  appears  the
         confusion lies in the  mind  of  the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
         Appellant in the form gave a lower figure of �22,152 which  is  the
         gross figure of �24,200 after deducting the expenses.


    7.   The sums are in fact not quite correct. The  breakdown  of  income
         shows income from employment and self-employment as  �42,297  which
         is described as a gross profit.  There is then �3 deposit  interest
         apparently added giving a  total  income  of  �42,300  after  which
         expenses of �1,735 and depreciation of �315, a total of  �2,050  is
         deducted leaving an incorrect figure of �40,249 as the profits  for
         the  period.   That  should  plainly  be  �40,250.   There  is   no
         explanation for that peculiar error.


    8.   The total sum should clearly be described as net  income  for  the
         period rather than profits because part came  from  employment  and
         part came from self-employment.


    9.   The error is, however, small and the Appellant does appear to have
         shown that he had employment income of �18,097 and net profit  from
         his business, including the �3 interest, of �22,153 taking  account
         of the accountant's apparent error.

9.   I agree with Mr Nasim's submission that there  was  some  confusion  by
    the caseworker at the Home Office whether the income from BP and  self-
    employment should be  gross  income  or  net  income  and  whether  the
    deductions for expenses as shown in the accountant's letter  should  be
    taken into account. It was his understanding that the income should  be
    gross income.  In any event whichever way one looks at it, be it  gross
    income or net income, I find  that  the  total  income  earned  by  the
    appellant from his BP employment  and  his  self-employment  which  was
    backed up by the bank statements and invoices, was between �40,000  and
    �49,099.  He was therefore entitled to the 25 points  claimed  by  him.
    Therefore the judge's finding at paragraph  7  that  the  total  figure
    should have been �40,250  brings  the  appellant  within  that  earning
    bracket.  I also find that the judge's finding at paragraph 8 does  not
    in any undermine the total net income  the  appellant  earned  for  the
    period in question.  On the evidence before her, I find that the  judge
    should have allowed the appeal.

10.  I find that the judge's decision cannot stand.  I remake  the  decision
    and allow the appellant's appeal.
