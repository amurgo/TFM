Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Gulvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms E Daykin, Counsel instructed by Immigration Point
                    Legal     Services


1.    There is nothing in the 1972 Immigration Rules (HC 510) that  provides
    that a person who cannot come within  one  of  the  categories  of  the
    Immigration Rules is to be refused an extension of stay for that reason
    alone. Rule 4 sets out the "main categories" of people who may be given
    leave, recognising the possibility that there are other categories  not
    specifically set out that can be dealt with on a  discretionary  basis.
    Accordingly, it was open to the Home Office to grant  an  extension  of
    stay as a businesswoman to someone who had entered as an au  pair.  The
    finding in OT (Turkey) [2010] UKUT 330 (IAC)  that  HC  510  prohibited
    switching to business status by anyone other  than  a  visitor  is  not
    considered correct. (See also now LE (Turkey) [2010] CSOH 153).

2.      Paragraph 28 of HC 510 does not require a person who had been  given
    leave as a businessman  to  demonstrate  as  a  pre-condition  for  the
    exercise of discretion that in each or any year in which they had  been
    given leave  in  that  capacity  they  had  complied  with   particular
    requirements of paragraph 21. Those requirements are directly  relevant
    only to the first application for permission to remain  and  the  first
    extension of stay.

3.      There  is  no  precise  code  in  HC  510   distinguishing   between
    maintenance and accommodation and precluding third party  contributions
    to living expenses.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the  Secretary  of  State's  appeal  against  the  decision  of
    Immigration Judge Callow given on 3 September 2010 whereby  he  allowed
    the appeal of  the  appellants  against  the  Home  Office  decision  1
    February 2010 refusing indefinite leave to remain.

 2. The appellants before the Immigration Judge are Turkish nationals  and,
    for convenience, we shall continue to call them the appellants in  this
    determination.  The second appellant is the husband of  the  first  and
    for present circumstances the outcome in his case depends on the result
    of the  appeal  of  his  wife.   The  first  appellant  (hereafter  the
    appellant) came to the United Kingdom in 2002 with entry  clearance  to
    work as an au pair.  On 3 January 2006 she was given leave to remain as
    a self-employed person pursuant to the  provisions  of  the  EC  Turkey
    Association Agreement also known as the Ankara Agreement of 1963.

 3. The appellant  established  herself  as  a  self-employed  provider  of
    domestic services as cleaner, housekeeper and baby-sitter.  After  that
    initial grant of leave the second appellant was granted entry clearance
    as a spouse to join his wife in April 2006 with leave to  remain  until
    the same date in  January  2007.  The  second  appellant  was  admitted
    without terms restricting his ability to take employment. The leave  to
    remain on both appellants was extended on 21 April 2007 until 3 January
    2010.

 4. In October 2007 the appellants purchased the flat which they  currently
    live on  a  Halifax  Mortgage.  In  2010  the  appellants  applied  for
    indefinite leave to remain on the basis that they had remained  in  the
    capacity as self-employed business woman and spouse for four years.  In
    her application the appellant submitted information from her accountant
    giving her business earnings between 2007 and 2010. The  value  of  her
    gross receipts to 5 April in those years were as follows; 2007 �12,790;
    2008 �10,795; 2009 �11,855.   The  accounts  show  that  the  appellant
    claimed expenses for premises costs,  general  administrative  expenses
    and travel, subsistence, legal and professional costs that reduced  her
    net profit in each of the three years to  �10,478,  �9,029  and  �9,752
    respectively.  In Section 5 of the application form the  appellant  was
    invited to give details of  personal  and  business  expenditure.   She
    estimated that her personal expenditure on mortgage, tax,  fuel  bills,
    food and travel was some �1,584 per month and her business  expenditure
    was some �290 per month.


 5. The application for indefinite leave was refused on the basis that  the
    appellant could not met the requirements of  the  after-entry  business
    provisions of the Immigration Rules as they stood in 1973.  The  notice
    stated:

         "The Secretary of State is not  satisfied  that  you  are  able  to
         maintain and accommodate yourself and your spouse while you are  in
         the United Kingdom as a self-employed individual".


    Further details were given of that conclusion in a letter of  the  same
    date in the following terms:

            "You have provided yearly  accounts  from  2007  to  2009  which
          indicates a staple net income of �9,029 and �9,752,  however  your
          early  expenditure  amounts  to  nearly  �16,968   therefore   the
          Secretary of State is not satisfied  that  you  can  maintain  and
          accommodate yourself and your spouse whilst you are in the  United
          Kingdom.  Therefore you do not  satisfy  the  requirement  of  the
          Immigration Rule for this category and  it  has  been  decided  to
          refuse your application."


 6. This application fell to be  judged  against  the  terms  of  the  1973
    Immigration Rules as a consequence of  Article  41  of  the  Additional
    Protocol dated 1972 to the Ankara Agreement.  Article  41  provides  as
    follows:-


          "1. The contracting parties shall refrain from introducing between
          themselves any new restrictions on the freedom of establishing and
          the freedom to provide services."

 7. In Case C-37/98 R v The Secretary of State for the Home  Department  ex
    parte Savas [2000]  ECR  I-2927  11  May  2000  the  Court  of  Justice
    concluded that the terms of Article 41 of the Additional Protocol  were
    directly effective in the following terms:

          "46. As its very wording shows, this provision lays down, clearly,
          precisely  and  unconditionally,  an  unequivocal  "stand   still"
          clause,  prohibiting  the  contracting  parties  introducing   new
          restrictions on the freedom of establishment as from the  date  of
          entry into force of the additional protocol.


          47. The Court has already held that Article 53 of the EC Treaty...
          prohibiting Member States from introducing any new restrictions on
          the rights of  nationals  of  other  Member  States  to  establish
          themselves in their territories  contains  an  obligation  entered
          into by the member state which amounts in law a duty not  to  act.
          The Court has held that such  an  express  prohibition,  which  is
          neither subject to any conditions, nor, as regards  its  execution
          or effect, to  the  adoption  of  any  other  measure  is  legally
          complete in itself  and  therefore  capable  of  producing  direct
          effects on the relations between  member  states  and  individuals
          (Case 6/64 Costa v Enel [1964] ECR 585 at page 596).


          48. Since the wording of Article 41(1) of the Additional  Protocol
          is almost identical to that of Article 53 of the EC Treaty it must
          be regarded as being directly applicable  for  the  same  reasons.
          However, Article 41(1) of the Additional  Protocol  prohibits  the
          introduction of  new  national  restrictions  on  the  freedom  of
          establishment and right of residence of Turkish nationals as  from
          the date of entry into force of that protocol in the  host  Member
          State.  It is for the national court to interpret domestic law for
          the purposes  of  determining  whether  the  rules  apply  to  the
          applicant in the main proceedings are less favourable  than  those
          which are applicable at the  time  when  the  additional  protocol
          entered into force."

 8. It was common ground before us that the rules that were  applicable  in
    the present case were the Statement of  Immigration  Rules  of  Control
    after Entry laid before the House of Commons on 23 October 1972 HC 510.

 9.  Paragraph 28 of those Rules under the heading "Settlement" provides as
    follows:

         "A person who is admitted in  the  first  instance  for  a  limited
         period and who  has  remained  here  for  four  years  in  approved
         employment or as a businessman or a self-employed person  or  as  a
         person of independent means may have the time  limit  on  his  stay
         removed unless there are grounds for maintaining it.   Applications
         for the removal of the time limit are to be considered in the light
         of all the  relevant  circumstances  including  those  set  out  in
         paragraph 4....."


      Paragraph 4 provides:


         "The succeeding paragraphs set out the main  categories  of  people
         who may be given leave to enter and who may seek variation of their
         leave, and the principles to be  followed  in  dealing  with  their
         application, or  initiating  any  variation  of  their  leave.   In
         deciding these matters account is  to  be  taken  of  all  relevant
         facts; the fact that the applicant satisfies the formal requirement
         of these rules to stay or further stay in the proposed capacity  is
         not conclusive in his favour.  It  will  for  example  be  relevant
         whether the person observed the time limit and condition subject to
         which he was admitted; whether  in  the  light  of  his  character,
         conduct or associations it is undesirable to permit him to  remain,
         whether he represents a danger to national security; or whether, if
         allowed to remain for the period for which he wishes  to  stay,  he
         might not be returnable to another country."
                   (Our emphasis)

10. In the present case the  immigration  summary  reveals  that  the  only
    conditions attached to the stay of the appellants from 2006 onwards was
    not to have recourse to public funds.  It is not  suggested  that  they
    have had such recourse.  Accordingly they have not breached  the  terms
    of their leave to enter or remain;  they  have  resided  here  lawfully
    throughout their stay and have been doing that  which  they  have  been
    given permission to do.  No discretionary  factor  exists  to  indicate
    refusal.

11. The IJ  concluded  that  there  was  no  requirement  set  out  in  the
    settlement rules on the appellant to demonstrate that she had supported
    and/or continued to support herself and any dependants from the profits
    of her business, but if there was such a requirement he  was  satisfied
    on the uncontested  evidence  submitted  that  she  had  done  so.   In
    reaching that conclusion the IJ no doubt had regard to the  grounds  of
    appeal which pointed out that the second appellant was earning  �13,000
    a year as a worker giving the couple a total income of �22,772.

12. There was no response by the Home Office to these  grounds  of  appeal.
    There was no appearance by a  presenting  officer  at  the  appeal  and
    accordingly no cross- examination or challenge of either  appellant  as
    to their living arrangements or family budget.

13. On 15 September 2010 the Secretary of State sought permission to appeal
    against this decision essentially on two basis:-

           i) The IJ was wrong to conclude that there  was  no  Immigration
              Rule  requiring  the  appellant  to  demonstrate   that   she
              supported herself or any dependants from the profits  of  the
              business.
          ii) The  IJ  had  failed  to  give  sufficient  reasons  for  his
              conclusion that the appellants  were  able  to  maintain  and
              accommodate themselves.

14. On 28 September 2010 SIJ Waumsley  considered  that  both  points  were
    arguable and added the observation that the respondent  might  want  to
    consider whether the appellants were entitled to  the  benefit  of  the
    business provisions of HC 510 in any event as the first  appellant  had
    entered the United Kingdom as an au pair  rather  than  a  visitor  and
    those rules made no provision  for  anyone  other  than  a  visitor  to
    transfer to business: see the determination of the Tribunal OT  (Ankara
    Agreement: Students,  Businessmen,  Workers)  Turkey  [2010]  UKUT  330
    (IAC).

15. Before us Mr Gulvin relied upon paragraph 21 of HC510.   This  provides
    as follows:

         "People admitted as visitors may  apply  for  the  consent  of  the
         Secretary of State to their establishing themselves  here  for  the
         purpose of setting up in business, whether on their own account  or
         as partners in a new or existing business.  Any such application is
         to be considered on merit.  Permission  will  depend  on  a  number
         factors including evidence that  the  applicant  will  be  devoting
         assets of his own to the business, proportional to his interests in
         it, that he will be able to bear his share of any liabilities  that
         the business may incur, and that his share of his profits  will  be
         sufficient to support him and any dependants. The applicant's  part
         in the business must not amount to disguised employment and it must
         be  clear  that  he  will  not  have  to  supplement  his  business
         activities by employment for which a  work  permit  is  required...
         Where the application  is  granted  the  applicant's  stay  may  be
         extended for up to twelve months on  a  condition  restricting  his
         freedom to take employment. A person admitted as a  businessman  in
         the first instance may be granted an appropriate extension of  stay
         if the conditions set out above are still satisfied at the  end  of
         the period that he was admitted initially. "
         (Our emphasis)

16. Mr Gulvin submitted as follows. First, it  was  a  requirement  of  the
    rules to obtain the original variation of leave to remain to  establish
    oneself in business or self-employment that "his share of  his  profits
    will be sufficient to support him  and  any  dependants".   Second,  if
    there was no ability to support oneself and  any  dependants  from  the
    profits of the business throughout the period of the  four  years  that
    leave to remain as a businessman was given, that would  be  a  relevant
    circumstance within the meaning of paragraph 28  and  or  paragraph  4.
    Accordingly the IJ was wrong to conclude that there was no  requirement
    in the Rules for the business profits to support the appellant and  her
    husband.

17. Further, Mr  Gulvin  submitted  that  since  the  appellant's  personal
    expenditure exceeded the profits of her business she was  incapable  of
    satisfying the requirement that the profits were sufficient to  support
    herself and any dependant. He acknowledged that  the  second  appellant
    was entitled to work and there had been no Home Office dispute  of  the
    contention that he brought �13,000 to the family budget.   He  accepted
    that the decision maker was probably wrong to look at the  net  profits
    of the business when considering ability to support  oneself  from  the
    business as some of the deductions in the business  expenses  were  for
    accommodation, travel and legal expenses that were  relevant  heads  of
    the personal and business  expenditure  disclosed  in  the  application
    form.  If attention is given to the net profit of  the  business,  then
    items of personal  expenditure  and  business  expenditure  from  which
    deductions have already been made must be ignored and that reduces  the
    gap between earnings and expenses significantly below  the  �7,000  odd
    identified in the decision letter.

18. Mr Gulvin also recognised that the Home Office had never challenged the
    appellants' ability to live modestly on the net profits of the business
    either when granting an extension of stay in 2007 or in response to the
    grounds of appeal in 2010.

19. We pointed out that if as a  result  of  the  husband's  earnings  both
    appellants decided to live at a higher standard of  living  than  would
    otherwise have been the case if the husband had no earnings, that  fact
    is no indication of an inability of the couple to live on  the  profits
    of the business.  The husband is entitled to contribute his earnings to
    the family budget to either decrease the  need  for  profits  from  the
    business to support him or acquire a better standard of accommodation.

Conclusions

20. We conclude that even if the  continued  ability  of  the  business  to
    support the appellant and her  husband  were  a  relevant  circumstance
    there was nothing wrong with the Immigration Judge's summary conclusion
    in favour of them.  As the Home Office had chosen  not  to  test  their
    evidence it was bound by the finding of fact  manifestly  open  to  the
    judge on all material before him.  The reasons for that conclusion were
    obvious once the husband's income could be taken into account as  noted
    at [19] above. The second ground of appeal is not made out.

21. However, we also conclude that the IJ was right to find that there  was
    no mandatory requirement in the settlement provisions in HC 510 for  an
    applicant to substantiate that in each year since the  grant  of  leave
    she had maintained herself and her dependants from the profits  of  the
    business.   The  contents  of  the  Immigration  Rules  in  1972   were
    fundamentally different from the very precise scheme under the  present
    rules and its predecessor for many years since about 1995.

22. Three differences can be noted here. First, there is nothing in HC  510
    that provides  that  a  person  who  cannot  come  within  one  of  the
    categories of the Immigration Rules is to be refused  an  extension  of
    stay for that reason alone.  Indeed paragraph 4 of HC 510 says in terms
    that the following paragraphs set out "the main categories"  of  people
    who may be given leave, recognising  the  possibility  that  there  are
    other categories not specifically set out that can be dealt with  on  a
    discretionary basis. Secondly, paragraph 28 does not in turn require  a
    person who had been given leave as a businessman to  demonstrate  as  a
    pre-condition for the exercise of discretion that in each or  any  year
    in which they have been given leave in that capacity they had  complied
    with particular requirements of paragraph 21.  Those  requirements  are
    only directly relevant to  the  first  application  for  permission  to
    remain as a businesswoman and the first extension of stay  thereof.  In
    terms the words look to the future "will" rather than the past  "have".
    Thirdly, there is no precise code  in  HC  510  distinguishing  between
    maintenance, accommodation and precluding third party contributions  to
    living expenses.

23. In  1973  the  Rules  themselves  were  a  open  textured  exercise  in
    discretion in the  round  having  regard  to  the  general  policy  and
    particular factors identified; so was the practice  in  applying  them:
    see R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal ex parte Joseph [1997]  Imm  AR  70
    and on appeal Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  v  Joseph
    [1977] Imm AR 96. See also R v Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal  ex  parte
    Peikazadi (1979 to 1980) Imm AR 191 and the discussion  in  Macdonald's
    Immigration Law and Practice, 1st Edition 1983 at page 199.  The Ankara
    Agreement precludes the introduction of  either  stricter  Rules  or  a
    stricter practice in the administration of the Rules.

24. We would accept the  submission  that  in  a  extreme  case  where  the
    evidence demonstrated that the business for  which  the  applicant  had
    been given permission to remain was  completely  dormant  or  generated
    such marginal funds as to be incapable of  supporting  anybody  in  the
    United Kingdom, the Home Office might well be  able  to  identify  that
    consideration as a highly relevant factor to the exercise of discretion
    to grant or refuse indefinite leave to remain. Such a   decision  would
    not be expressed in terms of failing to satisfy a  requirement  of  the
    Rules but the identification of a particular factor why  discretion  to
    grant indefinite leave was not considered appropriate.  In such a  case
    on appeal it would be open to the  Immigration  Judge  to  see  whether
    discretion  should  have  been  exercised  differently   in   all   the
    circumstances  of  the  case.   In  recognising   this,   a   pragmatic
    application of the principles of the  Rules  is  called  for.   It  was
    certainly the case in 1972 and for a number of  years  thereafter  that
    the Home Office recognised that a business often needed  some  time  to
    turn a profit and losses in the early years were not inconsistent  with
    a business that met the policy and purposes of the  Rules  in  general.
    The case was always considered in  the  round.  In  cases  of  doubt  a
    further extension of limited leave was often given.

25. We conclude that the Immigration Judge correctly construed the Rules in
    the case in  the  light  of  the  background  facts  and  the  reasoned
    decision.  The Home Office was not purporting to  identify  a  relevant
    circumstance in the exercise of discretion but simply  refused  on  the
    basis of a lack of satisfaction of a criterion it was not necessary for
    the appellant to satisfy under paragraph 28 HC 510.  We conclude  there
    is no material error of law in the construction of the  rules  and  the
    first ground on which permission to appeal had been granted is not made
    out either.

26. The respondent did not accept the invitation of the SIJ to  argue  that
    the appellant should never have been granted an extension  of  stay  as
    the businesswoman.  Mr Gulvin was wise not to raise that issue with us.
      First, on the proper construction of paragraph 4 of  HC  510  it  was
    open  to  the  Home  Office  to  grant  an  extension  of  stay  as   a
    businesswoman to someone who had entered as an au pair. The  Rules  did
    not need to make express provision. This was a  class  other  than  the
    main one set out in paragraph 4 where it might be appropriate to  grant
    such leave.  Second, the Upper Tribunal in OT (Turkey) [2010] UKUT  330
    (IAC) was principally concerned with  whether  breach  of  a  condition
    prohibiting establishment in business was the equivalent of  fraud,  an
    issue that is now being  revisited  by  the  Court  of  Justice   on  a
    reference by the Court of Appeal.  Thirdly, in so far as the  panel  in
    OT (Turkey) concluded at [27] of the determination that the 1972  Rules
    prohibited switching to business status by anyone other than a  visitor
    that conclusion will need revisiting in the light of  our  construction
    of the after entry rules and indeed the evidence  of  practice  to  the
    contrary  in the present case.

27.  Rule 21 refers to people  admitted  as  visitors  who  may  apply  for
    consent to establish themselves to set up in business, and no reference
    is made to students or indeed au pair girls in so doing.  Para 4 of the
    Rules makes it plain that an extension of stay can be granted to  other
    classes of people if considered appropriate. This was not considered in
    OT (Turkey).  There is nothing in the 1972  Rules  requiring  mandatory
    refusal of an application by a former student to  remain  in  business,
    indeed a claim by a student who may have been  in  the  United  Kingdom
    many years may well be  much  more  compelling  than  that  of  a  mere
    visitor, the most transient class of immigrant.

28. As the Court of Justice said in Savas at paragraph  47  the  standstill
    clause imposed a duty in law on a State not to act to make  a  practice
    any more restrictive than it had been in  1972.   The  introduction  of
    mandatory grounds for refusal  which  did  not  appear  in  1972  would
    therefore be prohibited in the case of  Turkish  nationals  seeking  to
    establish themselves in business or seeking extension  of  stay  having
    been granted such permission. Indeed if, as the 1972  Rules   and  such
    surviving data as to  practice  suggest,  students  were  not  normally
    specifically prohibited from setting up businesses  in  advance  of  an
    application to do so, it may be that the introduction of more stringent
    practices in recent years are themselves a violation of the  standstill
    agreement.

29. For the reasons given above, the two grounds of  appeal  identified  in
    the Secretary of State's Notice of Appeal do not demonstrate  that  the
    IJ made a material error of law.  We  accordingly  do  not  remake  the
    decision and the Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.
