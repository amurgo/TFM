                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL

1.   The Appellant, who was born on [ ] 1971, is a national of  Burundi.  It
    is her case that she participated in two demonstrations in  Burundi  on
    26 and 27 April  2015,  protesting  against  the  fact  that  President
    Nkurunziza had stood for election for  a  third  time.  She  also  gave
    demonstrators food at her restaurant in Bujumbura.

2.   The Appellant made a sur place application for asylum on 22 June  2015,
    when  she  was  in  the  United  Kingdom  visiting  her  sisters.   Her
    application was refused on 5 November 2015. Her  appeal  was  heard  by
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Butler,  who  dismissed  her  appeal  in  a
    decision, promulgated on  21  December  2016.  The  Appellant  appealed
    against this decision and First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Kimnell  granted
    permission to appeal on 21 March 2017, on  the  basis  that  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Butler  had  not  considered  the  Appellant's  fear  of
    persecution in the context of known country conditions.

ERROR OF LAW HEARING

3.   I heard oral submissions from counsel and the  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer and I have referred to the content of their submissions,  where
    relevant, below. The Home Office  Presenting  Officer  only  made  very
    brief submissions and accepted that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  had
    failed to take into account the Appellant's Tutsi ethnicity.

DECISION

4.   The Appellant had to establish that she was at risk of  persecution  on
    the basis of her political  opinion  if  she  were  to  be  removed  to
    Burundi.

5.   In Y v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] EWCA Civ  1223
    Lord Justice Keene found that:

     "25. There seems to me to be very little dispute  between  the  parties
    as to  the  legal  principles  applicable  to  the  approach  which  an
    adjudicator, now known as an immigration judge,  should  adopt  towards
    issues of credibility.  The  fundamental  one  is  that  he  should  be
    cautious before finding an account to be inherently incredible, because
    there is a considerable risk that he will be over influenced by his own
    views on what is or  is  not  plausible,  and  those  views  will  have
    inevitably been influenced by his own background in this country and by
    the customs and ways of our own society.   It  is  therefore  important
    that he should seek to view an appellant's account  of  events,  as  Mr
    Singh rightly argues, in the context of conditions in the country  from
    which the appellant comes.  The  dangers  were  well  described  in  an
    article by Sir Thomas Bingham, as he then was, in  1985  in  a  passage
    quoted by the IAT in Kasolo v SSHD 13190, the passage being taken  from
    an article in Current Legal Problems.  Sir Thomas Bingham said this:

     'An English judge may have, or think that he has, a shrewd idea of  how
    a Lloyds Broker or a Bristol wholesaler, or  a  Norfolk  farmer,  might
    react in some situation which is canvassed in the course of a case  but
    he may, and I think should, feel very much  more  uncertain  about  the
    reactions of a Nigerian merchant, or an Indian ships'  engineer,  or  a
    Yugoslav banker.  Or even, to  take  a  more  homely  example,  a  Sikh
    shopkeeper  trading  in  Bradford.  No  judge  worth  his  salt   could
    possibl[y] assume that  men  of  different  nationalities,  educations,
    trades, experience, creeds and temperaments would act as he might think
    he would have done or  even  -  which  may  be  quite  different  -  in
    accordance with his concept of what a reasonable man would have done."

     26. None of this, however, means that an  adjudicator  is  required  to
    take at face value an account of facts proffered by  an  appellant,  no
    matter how contrary to common sense and experience of  human  behaviour
    the account may be.  The decision maker is not expected to suspend  his
    own judgment, nor does Mr Singh contend that he should.  In appropriate
    cases, he is entitled to find that an account  of  events  is  so  far-
    fetched and contrary to reason as to be incapable of belief.  The point
    was well put in the Awala case by Lord Brodie at paragraph 24  when  he
    said this:

     "... the tribunal of fact need not necessarily  accept  an  applicant's
    account simply because it is not contradicted at the relevant  hearing.
    The tribunal of fact is entitled to make reasonable findings  based  on
    implausibilities, common sense and rationality, and may reject evidence
    if it is not consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as  a
    whole".

     He then added a little later:

     "... while a decision on credibility must  be  reached  rationally,  in
    doing so the decision maker is entitled to draw on his common sense and
    his ability, as a practical and informed person, to identify what is or
    is not plausible".

      27. I agree.  A decision maker is entitled to  regard  an  account  as
    incredible by such standards, but he must take care not to do so merely
    because it would not  seem  reasonable  if  it  had  happened  in  this
    country.  In essence, he must look through the spectacles  provided  by
    the information he has about conditions in  the  country  in  question.
    That is, in effect, what Neuberger LJ was saying in the case of HK  and
    I do not regard Chadwick LJ in the passage referred to  as  seeking  to
    disagree".

6.   Counsel for the Appellant gave  detailed  submissions  in  relation  to
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Butler's approach to the credibility  of  the
    Appellant's account. I find  that  when  reaching  adverse  credibility
    findings the First-tier Tribunal did not sufficiently  interrogate  the
    evidence before him. For example, in relation to the timing of her  sur
    place claim, he failed to take into  account  that  the  invoices  from
    [MT&T] confirmed that her return airline ticket, which she  had  bought
    on 25 April 2015, showed that she was due to fly  from  London  to  New
    York, Amsterdam and Naroibi before returning  to  Burundi  and  records
    made by the Respondent  showed  that  this  ticket  was  shown  to  the
    Immigration Officer conducting her screening interview.  Therefore,  it
    was not the case that she had not mentioned travelling  to  the  United
    States of America. In addition,  her  passport  contained  a  visa  for
    America which had been obtained on 19 March 2015, which indicated  that
    she did not have at that time any intention of applying for  asylum  in
    the United Kingdom.

7.    In  relation  to  her  wish  to  be  interviewed  in  Kirundi  at  her
    substantive interview, the record clearly states that she informed  the
    interviewer that if she was not able to get a Kirundi  interpreter  she
    was prepared to be interviewed in French.  The GCID - Case Record Sheet
    also noted that she wanted to be interviewed in "Burundi".  The  record
    of her visa application also shows that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    accepted that she was the Managing Director of [GS] and earned ï¿½1,800 a
    month and the stamps in her passport  showed  that  she  had  travelled
    widely.

8.   In addition, the First-tier Tribunal Judge did not reach  any,  or  any
    sustainable, reasons for not giving weigh to the arrest warrant  relied
    upon by the Appellant. The affidavit by [EB]  and  the  Fedex  document
    clearly provided some provenance for the document.

9.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge also found that the letter  from  Ms  [N]
    was entirely self-serving. In R (on the application of SS) v  Secretary
    of State for the Home  Department  ("self-serving"  statements)  [2017]
    UKUT 00164 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal found that:

     "(1) The expression "self-serving" is, to a  large  extent,  a  protean
    one. The expression itself tells us little or nothing. What  is  needed
    is a reason, however brief, for that designation. For example, a letter
    written by a third party to an applicant for  international  protection
    may be "self-serving" because it bears the hallmarks of  being  written
    to order, in circumstances where  the  applicant's  case  is  that  the
    letter was a spontaneous warning".

10.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge gave no reasons for  finding  the  letter
    to be "self-serving".

11.  Furthermore, in paragraph 17 of the decision  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge referred to  the  Appellant  having  had  produced  a  bundle  of
    documents, which included objective evidence.  However,  there  was  no
    further mention of any of the objective country evidence.  Instead,  at
    paragraph 47 of his decision, the First-tier Tribunal Judge stated that
    "the issue in this appeal is the credibility of the Appellant and  that
    of her documentary evidence. I did  not  find  her  to  be  a  credible
    witness".  This indicates that the credibility of the Appellant's claim
    was decided without any reference to the objective country evidence.

12.  In particular, in paragraph 51 of the decision the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge did not take into account the  objective  country  evidence  when
    considering whether she had participating in demonstrations in Burundi.
    The Human Rights Watch report  Burundi:  Spate  of  Arbitrary  Arrests,
    Torture confirmed that demonstrations  against  President  Nkurunziza's
    bid for a third term took place in April 2015.  The  reports  by  Human
    Rights Watch and Amnesty  International  confirmed  that  the  security
    services in Burundi and the Imbonerakure were still detaining and  ill-
    treating those suspected of being involved in these  demonstrations  in
    August 2015 and even October 2015.

13.  The Appellant had also submitted two further documents at the  hearing,
    which were not referred to by the First-tier Tribunal Judge. The  first
    contained Concluding observations of the Committee [against Torture and
    Other Cruel, Inhuman or  Degrading  Treatment  or  Punishment]  on  the
    special report of Burundi...,and was dated 9 September 2016. The second
    was the Report of  the  United  Nations  Independent  Investigation  on
    Burundi.., dated 29 September 2016. Both confirmed  the  events  relied
    upon by the Appellant and the fact  that  reprisals  escalated  in  May
    2015.

14.  Counsel for the Appellant also relied on these  and  other  reports  in
    relation to the  alternative  basis  to  her  claim  for  international
    protection, which was that she was at risk of persecution as  a  person
    of Tutsi origin, who had travelled to Rwanda  from  Musaga,  which  was
    seen by  the  Burundi  government  as  an  "opposition  neighbourhood".
    Although the First-tier Tribunal Judge mentioned her alternative  claim
    in paragraph 59 of his decision, he again  failed  to  interrogate  the
    totality of the evidence and also failed to take into account the  fact
    that the objective country  evidence  confirmed  that  persons  of  her
    profile were being targeted.

15.  Instead, he turned  the  obligation  to  take  into  account  objective
    evidence on its head and found in paragraph 57 that the  Appellant  had
    "carefully constructed" her account "to fit in with  the  situation  in
    Burundi".

16.  Therefore, I find that there were material errors of law in  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Butler's decision.

DECISION

(1)  The Appellant's appeal is allowed.

(2)  The decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge Butler is set aside.

(3)  The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard  de  novo
    before a First-tier Tribunal Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Butler.
