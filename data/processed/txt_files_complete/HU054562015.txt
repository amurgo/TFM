                            DECISION AND REASONS
                      (Delivered Orally on 26 May 2017)

Introduction

 1. This appeal comes before  the  Upper  Tribunal  by  way  of  permission
    granted by Judge P J M Hollingworth on 17  March  2017.  The  appellant
    appealed to the First-tier Tribunal, against a  decision  made  by  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department ("SSHD") on 28  August  2015
    refusing him leave to remain, both under the Immigration Rules  and  on
    Article 8 grounds outwith the Rules. The appeal was dismissed by  Judge
    Ross in a decision promulgated on 11 October 2016.

 2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 31 July 2006 as a  visitor.
    He has not been lawfully in the United Kingdom since the expiry of that
    leave, i.e. for around ten years.   He  submitted  an  application  for
    leave to remain in 2012, which was refused the following  year.  On  19
    July 2013, the appellant married a British citizen and on 18 March 2014
    he submitted an application for leave to remain based on  the  fact  of
    that marriage, as well as other relevant circumstances of his  life  in
    the United Kingdom.  This application was refused on 6 May  2014.   The
    appellant did not leave the country at that stage (as he ought to  have
    done). On 17 June 2015, the appellant was served  with  a  decision  to
    remove him. This led to  the  making  of  further  submissions  by  the
    appellant, which included evidence and submissions to the  effect  that
    he and his wife wished to start a family and intended to do so with the
    assistance of IVF  treatment.  This  application  was  refused  in  the
    decision under challenge.

    FtT's Decision

 3. The appeal came before Judge Ross on 27 September 2016, at  which  time
    the  appellant  and  his  wife  gave  oral  evidence  -  summarised  in
    paragraphs 8 and 9 of Judge Ross' decision. The appellant gave evidence
    to the effect that (i) he has three brothers and one sister in Nigeria,
    with whom he speaks once per month (ii) he has a child in Nigeria, aged
    13 and (iii) his wife has an uncle, sister and brother  in  the  United
    Kingdom. He further asserted  that  he  could  not  return  to  Nigeria
    without his wife.

 4. The appellant's wife gave similar evidence.  She moved to Nigeria  when
    she was 2ï¿½ years old and lived there for sixteen years before returning
    to the United Kingdom when she was 18.   She  has  only  been  back  to
    Nigeria three times since then.  She  has  a  number  of  close  family
    members in the United Kingdom. Her brother and sister live  in  Nigeria
    but they have their own commitments.  She has lived in a  council  flat
    in the UK for 25 years and she has been saving money in  order  to  pay
    for private IVF treatment.  In paragraph 10 of  its  decision  the  FtT
    summarised the medical evidence that was before the  Tribunal  relating
    to that IVF treatment.

 5. Ms Radford, who appeared on behalf of the  appellant  before  the  FtT,
    produced a lengthy skeleton argument to the FtT setting out a  detailed
    chronology, the relevant legal  framework  (including  the  Immigration
    Rules and the provisions of the 2002 Act) as well as citing from  well-
    known case law relating to Article 8 of the  Human  Rights  Convention.
    Her submissions in relation to  the  instant  appellant  are  found  in
    paragraph 32 of the skeleton argument, which I have had full regard to.

 6. The FtT turned to make its findings in paragraphs  13  onwards  of  its
    decision. It observed that  the  appellant's  presence  in  the  United
    Kingdom had been, for the most part, unlawful and identified  that  the
    only issue under  the  Rules  was  whether  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles to the appellant and his  wife  carrying  on  a  family  life
    together in Nigeria. The phrase 'insurmountable obstacles'  is  derived
    from paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM, with paragraph EX.2 of Appendix  FM
    providing the following definition thereof:

         "Insurmountable obstacles means the very  significant  difficulties
         which  would  be  faced  by  the  applicant  or  their  partner  in
         continuing family life together outside the  United  Kingdom  which
         could not be overcome or would entail very serious hardship for the
         applicant or their partner."

 7. The First-tier  Tribunal  dealt  with  the  appellant's  claims  within
    paragraphs 16 and 17 of its decision, stating as follows:

         "16. The appellant's return to Nigeria in order to  make  an  entry
             clearance application would inevitably result in  a  temporary
             separation of the couple however, contact would be  maintained
             by other methods of communication  and  the  appellant's  wife
             could visit  him  in  Nigeria  if  necessary.   I  accept  the
             evidence that if the appellant's wife left the UK,  she  would
             lose her council flat in which she has  lived  for  25  years.
             However, whilst that may present a difficult choice for her it
             is not unduly harsh when weighed against the public interest.

         17.  In  the  absence  of  such  insurmountable  obstacles,  it  is
             necessary to show other non-standard and  particular  features
             demonstrating that removal will be unjustifiably harsh  before
             making a  freestanding  Article  8  assessment  (Nagre).   The
             appellant and his wife are both perfectly healthy.  There  are
             no children involved.  I accept that  the  appellant  and  his
             wife are desirous of beginning  IVF  treatment,  however  this
             treatment is available privately in Nigeria, so they would  be
             no worse off there."

    There is subsequently a reference to,  and  consideration  of,  section
    117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

Decision and Discussion

 8. The grounds in support of the application for permission to appeal  are
    discursive and lengthy.  The grant of permission focuses on just one of
    those grounds (as indeed did Ms Aly before the Upper Tribunal today) in
    the following terms:

         "The  judge's  analysis  of   the   existence   or   otherwise   of
         insurmountable obstacles is arguably insufficient given the  extent
         of the submissions made on behalf of the appellant set against  the
         extent of the judge's  analysis  effectively  encapsulated  in  the
         summary provided at paragraph 16 of the decision.   The  judge  has
         proceeded thereafter at paragraph 17 of the  decision  to  consider
         whether removal would be  unjustifiably  harsh  in  relation  to  a
         freestanding Article 8 assessment."

 9. Today Ms Aly elucidates on that  ground  by  focusing  on  two  claimed
    errors in the decision, which can be summarised as  (i)  a  failure  to
    give adequate  reasons  given  the  information  that  was  before  the
    Tribunal and (ii) a failure to take into account relevant features when
    coming to its conclusion.

10. In developing her submissions focus was placed on three aspects of  the
    claim before the FtT, the first being  that  the  appellant's  wife  is
    engaged in IVF treatment in the United Kingdom. It  was  asserted  that
    this should have been viewed by the FtT as a significant reason  as  to
    why there would  be  insurmountable  obstacles  to  her  relocating  to
    Nigeria and, consequently, that the FtT's decision was irrational given
    this feature.

11. A second significant feature of the case was said to be the appellant's
    wife's relationship with her  family  members  in  the  United  Kingdom
    which, it was claimed, the FtT failed to have regard  to.  Finally,  it
    was asserted that the FtT failed to engage with the extensive  citation
    of case law in the appellant's skeleton argument.

12. I take these points in turn.

13. The evidence before the FtT  in  relation  to  the  IVF  treatment  was
    limited.  It is not in dispute that the appellant's wife is undertaking
    IVF treatment.  It is also disputed by the appellant, or  at  least  my
    attention was not drawn to any dispute, that  the  possibility  of  the
    appellant's wife becoming pregnant is so  limited  that  she  has  been
    required to obtain IVF treatment privately in the United Kingdom -  the
    NHS refusing to fund the treatment primarily as a  consequence  of  her
    age and the fact that she has fibroids.

14. Ms Aly submitted that because of the aforementioned  complications  the
    IVF procedure could not properly be conducted in Nigeria, a matter that
    she asserted the FtT had failed to take into account.   The  difficulty
    with this submission, however, is that there was no evidence before the
    FtT that such treatment could not be undertaken in Nigeria, even  given
    the appellant's wife's specific complicating circumstances.

15. The SSHD put evidence before the FtT that IVF treatment is available in
    Nigeria.  As I have indicated, there was no evidence before the FtT  to
    contradict that fact or support the contention that  it  would  not  be
    available to the appellant's wife, given her particular circumstances.

16. For these reasons, in my conclusion the FtT  was  entitled  to  say  at
    paragraph 17 that:

         "I accept that the appellant and his wife are desirous of beginning
         IVF treatment, however this treatment  is  available  privately  in
         Nigeria, so they would be no worse off there."

17. The FtT treated this as a  neutral  feature  when  considering  whether
    there would be insurmountable obstacles to the appellant's wife  moving
    to Nigeria to live  with  the  appellant.  In  my  conclusion,  it  was
    entitled to do so on the limited evidence that was available.

18. It may be, and I have been drawn to some additional evidence today that
    was not before the FtT, that evidence can be obtained  to  support  the
    contention put forward on behalf of the appellant. At this stage of the
    proceedings, however, I am required to determine whether the FtT  erred
    in law.  It cannot be said that it erred in failing to take account  of
    evidence that it did not have before it, and the evidence that has been
    produced is not evidence that demonstrates a clear error of fact by the
    FtT.

19. Moving on, the second submission raised by  Ms  Aly  is  the,  claimed,
    failure of the FtT to consider the  circumstances  of  the  appellant's
    wife's family in the United Kingdom, which is of course also  a  family
    that the appellant himself is engaged with.

20. It is clear that  the  FtT  was  fully  aware  of  the  fact  that  the
    appellant's wife has family members in the United Kingdom.  This can be
    seen from paragraph 9 of its decision.  The witness  statements  relied
    upon in support of this submission by Ms Aly, (i.e. those drawn by  the
    appellant's wife and by the appellant), provide very  limited  evidence
    as to the nature of the relationship between the  appellant,  his  wife
    and the  appellant's  wife's  family  members.  The  highpoint  is  the
    assertion by the appellant's wife that she has  "a  close  relationship
    with [her] siblings".

21. Absent the provision any specific evidence as to the consequences of  a
    separation between the appellant's wife and her  UK-based  family,  the
    relevance of these familial relationships to the issue of whether there
    exist insurmountable obstacles to the appellant and his wife  having  a
    family life together in Nigeria is, at best, limited. The  FtT  plainly
    looked at the evidence as a whole and it was not required to deal  with
    each and every point raised or piece of evidence  produced.  I  see  no
    requirement in the circumstances of this  case  for  the  FtT  to  have
    engaged specifically with the aforementioned feature

22. The third point relied upon by Ms Aly is the claimed failure of the FtT
    to engage with the extensive  citation  of  case  law  set  out  in  Ms
    Radford's skeleton argument.  In this regard, I observe that  the  case
    law is well-known to those in the immigration field.  There is  nothing
    therein which is remotely contentious. Of most  significance,  however,
    is the fact that there is nothing in the FtT's decision  that,  on  its
    face, is inconsistent with the case law binding on it, neither  was  my
    attention drawn to any specific inconsistency with  such  case  law.  I
    accept that the FtT's direction to the decisions in MF [2012] UKUT  393
    and Izuazu [2013] UKUT 45 is out-dated,  those  decisions  having  been
    overtaken by more recent decisions of  the  Court  of  Appeal  and  the
    Supreme Court but, nevertheless, the position  remains  that  there  is
    nothing in the FtT's decision  which  identifies  that  it  applied  an
    approach inconsistent with binding case law.

23. When the FtT's decision is looked at as a whole I do  not  accept  that
    the reasons provided  therein,  albeit  limited,  can  be  said  to  be
    unlawfully inadequate in the circumstances of this case.

24. Turning to Article 8 outwith the Rules, in this regard the case law  is
    quite clear, the starting point is whether the Rules can be met and, if
    they cannot, then one looks at the features of the claim overall to see
    whether there is anything compelling in the  case  that  would  require
    leave to be granted. This consideration also has to be  viewed  in  the
    context of Section 117B of the  2002  Act,  which  the  FtT  took  full
    account of in paragraph 19 of its decision.

25. The appellant has been in the United Kingdom unlawfully for almost  the
    entirety of the time he has spent here.  The FtT had that in mind  but,
    nevertheless, went on to look at the relevant circumstances as a whole,
    the most significant of which, it was said, was the appellant's  wife's
    need for IVF treatment, the fact that she would be required to give  up
    of her council flat if she moved to Nigeria,  and  the  fact  that  the
    appellant had been in the United Kingdom for a lengthy period of  time.



26. All of these features were taken into account by the  FtT  and,  in  my
    conclusion, the FtT's findings  were  open  to  it  given  the  limited
    evidence made available by the appellant. Indeed, I have considered the
    evidence that was before the FtT for myself  and,  having  done  so,  I
    cannot see that any Tribunal considering such evidence could rationally
    come to a different conclusion than that which Judge Ross came to.

27. For all these reasons, I find that the FtT's decision does not  contain
    an error of law capable of affecting the outcome of the appeal.

28. I make one  further  observation.  There  is  now  further  and  better
    evidence available to the appellant, which was not contained within the
    bundle put before the FtT. It may be when that evidence  is  considered
    that a different outcome will be reached, but that is for the  SSHD  to
    consider should a further application  be  made  in  reliance  on  such
    evidence.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal's decision does not contain  an  error  of  law  and
remains standing.
