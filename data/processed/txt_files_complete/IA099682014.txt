For the Appellant:     Mr T Mahmood instructed by Dominion Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs K Heath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a Nigerian national born on  26th  January  1970.   On
    14th December 2013 he applied for indefinite leave to remain as a  Tier
    1 (General) Migrant.  His application was refused by the Respondent  on
    6th February 2014 and directions  were  given  for  his  removal  under
    Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality  Act  2006.   The
    Respondent's reasons for refusal are set out  in  a  letter  dated  6th
    February 2014.

 2. The Appellant exercised his right of appeal and his appeal was heard at
    Stoke-on-Trent on 20th May 2014 by Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Frankish.  The Appellant was not legally represented.   The  Respondent
    was represented by a Presenting Officer, Mrs V Boden.

 3. Judge Frankish  notes,  at  paragraph  5  of  the  determination,  that
    contrary to directions, the Appellant filed  no  witness  statement  or
    documents.  The First-tier Judge admitted further documents provided by
    the Appellant at the  hearing  which  are  referred  to  later  in  the
    determination.  However, the judge correctly refers to the  restriction
    imposed by Section 19 of the UK Borders Act 2009  as  now  incorporated
    into Section 85(4) of the 2002 Act.

 4. The Respondent's reasons for refusal are summarised at paragraph  6  of
    the determination.  The application was  considered  against  paragraph
    245CD of the Immigration Rules.  The Appellant was required to gain  45
    points for previous earnings under Appendix A.  Since  the  Appellant's
    application was dated 14th December 2013 the fifteen month period  from
    which he was entitled to demonstrate twelve months' earnings runs  from
    14th September 2012 to 14th December 2013.   The  Appellant  sought  to
    rely upon earnings from 18th September 2012 to 12th December  2013  but
    did not specify a twelve month period.  He was  therefore  assessed  on
    the past twelve months i.e. 24th December 2012 to  12th  December  2013
    which showed earnings of �32,639.59 gross,  �29,562.59  net.   However,
    only �3,008.43 of this could be corroborated from documents  submitted.
    Therefore the Appellant was awarded nil points out of 45  for  earnings
    and nil points out of 5 for  UK  experience  since  he  had  failed  to
    demonstrate the requisite minimum of �16,000 income in the UK.

 5. It is apparent  from  paragraph  7  of  the  determination  that  Judge
    Frankish  found  the  Appellant's  oral  evidence  to  be   incoherent.
    However, Judge Frankish managed to discern the main  points  which  the
    Appellant was attempting to make which were that he  had  practised  in
    the UK as a doctor in psychiatry for five years and that he ought to be
    allowed to continue.  He had  been  wanting  to  return  home  but  the
    Respondent had retained his passport.  The Appellant  claimed  to  have
    paid a lot of money in fees for a first-class service but  had  instead
    received what he described as a shoddy service.

 6. The judge's findings and conclusions are encapsulated at paragraph 9 of
    the determination.  The judge rightly points out that the onus is  upon
    the Appellant to demonstrate that he earned the  requisite  minimum  of
    �16,000 for twelve consecutive months during the preceding fifteen.  It
    should be  easy  for  a  doctor  to  prove  that.   However,  the  bank
    statements which the Appellant  provided  served  to  corroborate  only
    �3,008  of  earnings.   Therefore  the  Appellant  entirely  failed  to
    discharge the burden of proof.  No Article 8 issues were brought to the
    judge's attention.  The Appellant failed the twenty years'  test  under
    the current Rules and no compelling circumstances were brought  to  the
    judge's attention to justify separate consideration outside  the  Rules
    pursuant to the recent Gulshan guidance.  On that basis the appeal  was
    dismissed.

 7. An application for permission to appeal was submitted  by  the  present
    representatives  on  6th  June  2014.   The  Appellant  was  previously
    represented by Cape Hill Solicitors of 54  Waterloo  Road,  Cape  Hill,
    West Midlands who had submitted the Appellant's Notice and  Grounds  of
    Appeal.  It is not entirely clear from the Tribunal file at which point
    the Appellant changed representatives.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted in the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  29th
    June 2014.  The First-tier Judge who granted permission  considered  it
    arguable  that  Judge  Frankish  had  given  inadequate   reasons   for
    concluding that the Appellant did not meet the requirements of Appendix
    A of the Immigration Rules because he had only  substantiated  earnings
    of �3,008 by  reference  to  his  bank  statements.   The  Respondent's
    representative filed a response under Rule 24 on  1st  July  2014.   In
    summary, the Respondent submitted that the  First-tier  Judge  directed
    himself appropriately and made no error of law.

 9. Thus the matter came before me in the Upper  Tribunal  on  18th  August
    2014.  The Appellant was present and representation  was  as  mentioned
    above.  After hearing submissions from both representatives I  reserved
    my decision on the error of law issue which I now give.

10. For the Appellant, Mr  Mahmood  (perhaps  sensibly)  did  not  adopt  a
    fourteen  page  skeleton  argument   submitted   by   the   Appellant's
    representatives in a bundle of documents  received  at  Stoke  on  15th
    August 2014.  Mr Mahmood referred to paragraph 9 of the  determination,
    which I have already summarised above,  and  submitted  that  this  was
    simply inadequate for disposing of the entire appeal.

11. Mr Mahmood referred to entries shown in the  Appellant's  HSBC  advance
    bank statements at pages 76, 77 and 79 of  the  appeal  bundle.   These
    documents also appear at Annex  E  in  the  Respondent's  bundle  which
    indicates that they were before the decision-maker when the decision to
    refuse  was  taken.   Unhelpfully,  the  relevant  entries  have   been
    completely obliterated by highlighting in the photocopying process  but
    I was informed that they are for  �3,162.35,  �1,782.28  and  �3,799.84
    respectively.  All credits appear to be from Tanina Consulting  Ltd,  a
    company of which the Appellant claims  to  be  the  sole  director  and
    shareholder.

12. As I observed to Mr Mahmood, whilst  one  appreciates  the  distinction
    between a limited  company  and  a  private  individual,  these  credit
    entries in the Appellant's bank statements merely demonstrated that  he
    transferred funds to himself from his own limited  company.   There  is
    nothing in documentary form to indicate the origin of these  funds  and
    there is certainly nothing to indicate  that  they  represent  earnings
    from the Appellant's claimed medical  practice.   Mr  Mahmood  accepted
    that no documentary evidence had been submitted prior to  the  decision
    to demonstrate that the Appellant was  in  receipt  of  earnings  as  a
    doctor.

13. For the Respondent, Mrs Heath submitted that the First-tier  Tribunal's
    determination disclosed no error of law.  The date of decision was  6th
    February 2013.  All the documents in the appeal bundle from page 109 to
    150 had been sent on 13th February 2013, which was approximately a week
    after the Respondent's decision and were therefore not before the  Home
    Office when the decision was taken.  Therefore this  material  was  not
    admissible.

14. Mrs Heath submitted that paragraphs 8 and 9 of the  determination  were
    sufficient to deal with the material which was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  There was a single issue for  the  Tribunal  to  decide  and
    therefore a brief decision was adequate.

15. I agree with Mrs Heath.  Having looked carefully at the documents which
    were before the First-tier Tribunal, it is apparent that the  Appellant
    has failed to rebut  the  Respondent's  finding  that  only  �3,008  of
    earnings could be corroborated by the documents  supplied.   Therefore,
    the Respondent was justified in awarding no points under Appendix A for
    earnings.  The decision was therefore in accordance with the law.

16. So far as Article 8 is concerned, this has been addressed by the First-
    tier Judge at paragraph 9 of the determination, as mentioned above.   I
    note that in the Appellant's original handwritten Grounds of Appeal  he
    claims that the decision is unlawful because it  is  incompatible  with
    his rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.   No  details
    have been supplied in support of that bare  assertion  and  no  details
    were brought to the attention of the  First-tier  Judge.   It  was  not
    pursued my Mr Mahmood before me.

DECISION

The making of the decision by the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of a material error on a point of law.  I  uphold  the  determination
and dismiss the appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
