 1. These appeals were listed before me for case management on  4  November
    2015.  Ms. Isherwood  representing  the  Respondent  provided  me  with
    copies of two letters from the Respondent to the Appellants.

 2. The first was in respect of Meche Albert Atisele, dated 2 May 2015, and
    stated that it was enclosing  his  certificate  of  registration  as  a
    British citizen.

 3. The second letter was dated 30 October 2015.  This was  in  respect  of
    the other four Appellants and stated that it had been decided to  grant
    them limited  leave  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  outside  the
    immigration rules until 30 April 2018.

 4. Therefore, in accordance with section 104(4A) of the  2002  Act,  these
    appeals are to be treated as abandoned.
