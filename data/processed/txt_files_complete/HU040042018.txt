Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Cunha, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Saini, instructed by Vision Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The appellant and proceedings

 1. The appellant Secretary of State was the respondent before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal and for ease of reference I refer to the parties as  they
    were then. The appeal is brought with permission granted by the  First-
    tier tribunal.

 2. Ms Cunha submitted that the judge had perversely reached the conclusion
    that the discrepancy in the  records  that  the  appellant  gave  about
    earnings to UK VI, to make out his claim under the  immigration  rules,
    and those given to HMRC in respect of  his  tax  liabilities,  did  not
    establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been deceitful or
    dishonest towards HMRC, and so justifying a decision that his character
    and conduct meant that he was undesirable and so should not be  granted
    leave that he was otherwise entitled to.

 3. First, the judge was wrong to place any weight on  the  fact  that  his
    accountant had taken responsibility for the error because it has  often
    been noted that an applicant must take responsibility for his  own  tax
    affairs because not only would he have  supplied  the  figures  to  his
    accountant he would have  checked  them  and  would  have  individually
    received a tax bill see R (on the application of Samant) v SSHD  [2017]
    UKAITUR JR/6546/2018).

 4. I find no merit in this ground not least because the evidence from  the
    accountant was not contested at the hearing before the  judge,  and  it
    was not submitted to the judge that it was evidence which was incapable
    of providing a plausible explanation for the error on the  tax  return.
    Although there are unattractive aspects to that evidence they were  not
    relied upon before the judge as having any significance. It is not  for
    the judge to make out the respondent's case.

 5. Second, the judge was wrong to find it significant that  HMRC  did  not
    consider the matter to be one which warranted a penalty or reference to
    the police, in the case of Abbasi JR/13807/2016 the fact that HMRC  had
    'not yet seen fit to issue a  penalty  notice'  was  neither  here  nor
    there.

 6. I find no merit in this ground because this case is not  on  all  fours
    with the position in Abbasi because here the HMRC had investigated  and
    reached a decision that  the  act  was  culpably  careless  but  not  a
    deliberate deception, so that  this  was  not  a  "not  yet"  position.
    Further as the quote in the grounds shows what the court went on to say
    was that what HMRC does or does not do is not necessarily  relevant  to
    actions by the Secretary of State, to  the  point  that  they  are  not
    necessarily irrelevant, and consideration of the position does not show
    misdirection or perversity. Further this is not a  case  where  in  any
    event the position of HMRC was determinative but  merely  part  of  the
    factual matrix.

 7. There is an additional difficulty with these first two grounds reliance
    on JR proceedings because in JR proceedings the context and the  burden
    are entirely different. There the respondent only need show rationality
    in attributing a causal nexus between the act and  the  deception.  The
    judge in this statutory appeal was deciding whether in fact  there  had
    been deception practised on HMRC as  the  respondent  argued,  and  the
    burden is on the respondent.

 8. Third the  judge  misdirected  himself  at  [12]  in  his  approach  to
    engagement of paragraph 322(5) of the  rules,  limiting  engagement  to
    matters of convictions and national  security,  failing  to  appreciate
    that tax evasion can constitute sufficient  to  meet  the  standard  of
    culpable conduct making it undesirable to grant the person leave.

 9. I find no merit here because the ground oversimplifies what  the  judge
    says at [12] so that the overall effect is mischaracterised. The  judge
    was entitled to note that the appellant had not been  found  guilty  of
    any offence or been reported for consideration of any offence and  that
    he is not a threat to national security, not  just  because  those  are
    uncontested facts, but because those are both categories  which  engage
    322(5) and the judge is plainly simply referring  to  them  to  explain
    that those categories are not engaged. The judge goes on  to  say  that
    "on the available evidence I cannot be satisfied that the appellant has
    been dishonest of deceitful as alleged and I cannot be  satisfied  that
    he has demonstrated that his remaining in the UK would  be  undesirable
    under paragraph 322 (5)."Ignoring the irrelevant  typographical  errors
    plainly what the judge is considering  here  is  the  evidence  of  tax
    evasion as a factor or ground for  engagement  beyond  convictions  and
    national security so that a fair reading makes it plain that he is  not
    limiting engagement as these grounds suggests.

Decision

10. The appellant has failed to show that the decision is marred  by  legal
    error and the decision allowing the appeal stands.
