                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellants

1.   The Appellants are both citizens of Pakistan  and  are  brothers.   The
    First Appellant was born on 24th March 1984 and the  Second  Appellant
    was born on 4th March 1983.  They appeal against decisions of Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Woolley sitting at Newport on 23rd January 2015
    who dismissed their appeals against decisions of the  Respondent  dated
    7th September 2014.  Those decisions were  to  refuse  the  Appellants'
    application for leave to remain under  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  of  the
    points-based system and to remove  them  by  way  of  directions  under
    Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality  Act  2006.   The
    Second Appellant was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom on  28th
    August 2010 as a Tier 4 Student valid until 14th February  2012.   This
    was extended on 2nd September 2012 until 29th  June  2012  and  further
    extended on 15th August 2012 until 15th August 2014.

2.   Both Appellants made their application as team  members  for  extension
    of leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant on 21st July 2014
    a few days before their current leave was due  to  expire.   The  First
    Appellant had  obtained  a  Master  of  Business  Administration  (MBA)
    qualification in 2012 from Cardiff Metropolitan University and was  now
    a business development  consultant.   The  Second  Appellant  had  also
    obtained his MBA in 2012 from Cardiff Metropolitan  University  and  he
    was now a marketing consultant.  Both Appellants stated they had access
    to funds of not less than �50,000.

3.   The Appellants were required to score a  minimum  of  75 points  under
    paragraphs 35 to 53 of Appendix A to the Immigration Rules by paragraph
    245DD(b). The Appellants needed 25  points  for  access  to  funds,  25
    points for funds held in  a  regulated  financial  institution  and  25
    points for funds disposable in the United Kingdom.

Explanation for Refusal

4.   The Respondent awarded  them  no  points  under  Appendix  A  for  four
    reasons:

    (i)  The Appellants had not provided  sufficient  evidence  with  their
    application as specified in the Appendix.  As evidence of their  access
    to at least �50,000 held in their own name, the Appellants had provided
    an Askari Bank statement and letters in  the  names  of  the  two  team
    members, and a Metro Bank statement  in  the  names  of  the  two  team
    members.  The Respondent did not consider that this  met  the  criteria
    specified  under  Appendix  A  because  the   Askari   Bank   statement
    demonstrated access to �14,801 on 11th July 2014  and  the  Metro  Bank
    statement demonstrated access to �36,203 on 12th July 2014. As the bank
    statements had different dates  the  Appellants  could  not  show  bank
    statements that evidenced access to the full �50,000 on any one day.

    (ii) As evidence of advertising the Appellants had submitted a copy  of
    their website but the Rules  stated  that  specified  documents  either
    together or individually must  cover  a  continuous  period  commencing
    before 11th July 2014 up to no earlier than  three  months  before  the
    date of the application. The leaflets produced by  the  Appellants  did
    not come within that time period.

    (iii)    The business' website was  registered  and  owned  by  another
    entity Vista Print.  The advertising or marketing material had to  show
    the applicants' names and the name of  their  business  or,  where  the
    business was trading online, confirmation of ownership  of  the  domain
    name of the business's website.  As the domain  ownership  was  in  the
    name of Vista Print the Appellants could not satisfy that requirement.

    (iv) The Appellants had not provided any documentation from HM  Revenue
    & Customs to confirm that their business was registered for corporation
    tax.

5.   The Respondent was not satisfied that the Appellants qualified for  the
    award of points.  As they had not demonstrated they were eligible to be
    awarded points for access to funds it followed that they  were  awarded
    no points for funds held in a regulated financial institution or  funds
    disposable in the United Kingdom.

The Hearing at First Instance

6.   The Appellants appealed against those decisions.  At  the  hearing  the
    Respondent argued that the Metro Bank document showed that  funds  were
    available on 12th July but the Rule provided that it must be  available
    on 11th July.  Metro Bank statements were produced  monthly  which  the
    Appellants could have provided at the time of their  application.   For
    the Appellants it was  argued  that  the  relevant  evidence  had  been
    supplied to the Respondent at the time of the application.   There  had
    been a payment of �700 on 12th July 2014  into  the  Metro  Bank  which
    brought the account up to �36,203.19.  That was good evidence that  the
    balance the day before (that is the date of  the  Askari  Bank  letter)
    had been �35,503.19.

7.   In his determination  the  Judge  held  that  as  the  Appellants  were
    relying on multiple  documents  they  had  to  show  the  total  amount
    required of �50,000 was available on the same  date.   As  the  letters
    from the two banks were on two different dates they could not do  this.
    The wording of the relevant paragraph was precise as  to  the  need  to
    show "the total amount required is available on the same  date".   That
    had to be 11th July as the Askari Bank statement did  not  refer  to  a
    date later than 11th July.  The bank information from  the  Metro  Bank
    did not specify 11th July.  The Judge held that the Appellants had  not
    shown that they had access to the required figure of �50,000  or  above
    on 11th July 2014.

8.   In relation  to  the  requirement  to  show  advertising  or  marketing
    material, the Judge held that the Appellants must show  advertising  or
    marketing material up to no earlier than three months before  the  date
    of the application.  As the application  was  made  on  25th  July  the
    Appellants had to show material in the period from 25th April  to  25th
    July 2014.  The Appellants had argued that they could show this because
    they could show leaflets advertising their  business  produced  on  8th
    July 2014 within that three month period.  That assertion relied on the
    production of an invoice from the company who had printed the leaflets,
    ISB Design and Print. However, the invoice  was  not  produced  to  the
    Respondent with the application and therefore could not be produced  as
    evidence before the Judge pursuant to the operation of Section  85A  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.   The  Judge  found
    discrepancies in the evidence of the two Appellants as to how and  when
    the leaflets were produced which he outlined at  paragraph  27  of  his
    determination.  The earliest date that it could be shown  the  leaflets
    were in existence was when the application was made, namely  25th  July
    2014 and that fell foul of the requirements.

9.   There was no evidence  that  the  business  was  trading  online.   The
    Appellants had not shown  that  they  owned  the  domain  name  of  the
    business's website.  All they had produced was an  invoice  from  Vista
    Print for a standard website for which they had to pay �71.99 per annum
    starting 15th July 2015.  The Vista Print order was dated 6th November
    2014 and therefore they could not show they owned the  domain  name  at
    the time of application and  nor  could  they  show  that  the  website
    covered a continuous period commencing before 11th July 2014 (the  date
    the Rules changed) up to no earlier than three months before  the  date
    of the application.  They could  not  show  compliance  with  paragraph
    41(e)(iii) of Appendix A.

10.  The Appellants were obliged to produce a printout from Companies  House
    showing the registered office as well as documentation confirming  that
    the business was registered  for  corporation  tax.   In  their  bundle
    produced for the hearing they had produced  evidence  dated  July  2014
    from HMRC but this had not been produced to  the  Respondent  with  the
    original application.  The Appellants had  sought  to  argue  at  first
    instance that the Respondent should have considered the requirements of
    evidential flexibility and asked for documentation  from  the  HMRC  to
    confirm that the company was registered for corporation tax.  The Judge
    considered the Court of Appeal decision in Rodriguez [2014] EWCA Civ  2
    and concluded that the  Respondent  was  not  obliged  to  request  the
    information concerning corporation tax.

11.   The  Respondent  had  quoted  part  of  paragraph  245AA(c)   of   the
    Immigration Rules in her refusal letter and it was therefore clear  she
    must have considered the whole of the  sub-paragraph.   The  Respondent
    had not requested relevant documents because the application  had  been
    refused for other reasons.  The Judge found the Respondent was  correct
    in her conclusions and that the Respondent's conclusion was reasonable.
     The relevant information did not fall within the  scope  of  paragraph
    245AA(b), for example it did not concern documents in  a  sequence,  in
    the wrong format etc.  In Rodriguez there was no evidence or reason  to
    believe that the applicant had other  funds.   In  the  present  appeal
    there was no reason  to  suppose  that  the  evidence  being  requested
    existed.  The Judge dismissed the appeal including under Article 8.

The Onward Appeal

12.  The Appellants appealed against the Judge's decision, arguing that  the
    applicable Rules to the appeal were those that were  in  force  at  the
    time the immigration decision was taken (citing AA [2008] UKAIT 00003).
     The relevant date for consideration of the  Rules  was  therefore  7th
    September  2014,  the  date  of  refusal.   The  Judge  had  applied  a
    requirement that an applicant would only be considered to  have  access
    to funds if the specified documents in paragraph 41-SD were provided to
    show cash money to the amount required  and  where  multiple  documents
    were provided they must show the total amount required was available on
    the same date.  However, the requirement that where multiple  documents
    were provided they must show the total amount required available on the
    same date was inserted on 6th November 2014 and transitional provisions
    applied.  That is after the Respondent's decision had been  taken.   It
    was apparent from the documents that the  Appellants  did  indeed  have
    access to the required funds at the relevant time.  Not  only  did  the
    amount brought forward in  the  Metro  Bank  show  �35,503.19  but  the
    statement from the Metro Bank (not seen by the Respondent at  the  date
    of decision) for the period 2nd June to 27th June 2014 showed the  same
    amount from that date through to 12th July.  The transaction statements
    only showed when there were changes to the account  and  there  was  no
    change.  The Appellants could not show that they had some other  amount
    than the �35,503.19 in the Metro Bank on 11th July.  That was there at
    the time, the only reason it was not shown was  because  there  was  no
    transaction on that date.

13.  In relation to marketing material the Judge had again quoted the  wrong
    Rule.  The Judge had quoted paragraph 41(e) of Appendix  A,  but  there
    was no paragraph 41(e). I pause  to  note  here  that  what  the  Judge
    appears to have done in the determination is to have run  together  two
    separate paragraphs.  Paragraph 41(a) of Appendix A does  indeed  state
    what I have referred to above.  The sub-paragraph (e) which  the  Judge
    went on to quote, (which refers  to  the  evidential  requirements  for
    advertising or marketing material and evidence of  the  business  being
    registered for corporation tax), is  a  sub-paragraph  of  a  different
    paragraph  namely  41-SD  of  Appendix  A.   That   sub-paragraph   was
    subsequently amended on 6th April 2015 but for  the  purposes  of  this
    appeal the Judge was correct in his quote of sub-paragraph (e) (if  not
    his attribution of it) as it did indeed indicate that if  an  applicant
    was applying under the provisions in sub-paragraph (d) of  Table  4  he
    must also provide the relevant advertising or  marketing  material  etc
    (see paragraph 33 below).

14.  The Judge  set  out  the  relevant  requirements  as  at  the  date  of
    decision.  Subsequently those evidential requirements were  amended  on
    6th April 2015 but that is  not  relevant  for  the  purposes  of  this
    appeal.  The Judge was also correct in quoting the relevant  Rules  for
    the requirement to show the company was registered for corporation tax,
    that having been inserted on 11th July 2014 and again in force  at  the
    time of the decision.  There appears to have been a typographical error
    in the determination in that the Judge referred to  this  provision  as
    being vii whereas it was in fact vi.

15.  Overall the grounds were incorrect to argue that as  at  7th  September
    2014 the Appellants only had to show  one  or  more  of  the  specified
    documents not a cumulative amount.  Paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii) was amended
    by HC 532 on 11th July 2014 and thus in force at the date of decision.
    That paragraph read as the Judge had set it out in  his  determination,
    not as the grounds of onward appeal had suggested.

16.  The grounds further argued that there was no  definition  of  ownership
    of a website.  Ordinary people could not build a website and physically
    own a domain, they  required  it  to  be  leased  to  them  and  to  be
    maintained by a platform such as Vista Print.  The Judge's  alternative
    finding that the Appellants had not shown they owned the domain name of
    the business website was in error.  The Respondent had not taken  issue
    with the question of trading online  and  that  should  not  have  been
    raised by the Judge. In relation to the HMRC registration the Judge had
    again erred it  was  argued  by  using  the  wrong  Rules,  applying  a
    financial requirement that did not exist.

17.  The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Davis  on  26th  March  2015.   He  granted
    permission, writing, "Careful reading of the grounds satisfies me  that
    it is arguable the Judge did not apply  the  correct  Immigration  Rule
    that was at the date of decision".   The  Respondent  replied  to  this
    grant of permission on 10th April  2015  arguing  that  the  Judge  had
    directed himself appropriately.  While it did  appear  that  there  had
    been an error of law in that the Judge may have relied upon  the  wrong
    Immigration Rule, the error was not material since the  Appellants  had
    failed to meet all the requirements of the relevant Immigration  Rules.
    The Appellants had been legally represented by Counsel  throughout  and
    the issue of the incorrect Immigration Rules  was  only  sought  to  be
    raised as an issue post-hearing and post-decision.

The Hearing before Me

18.  At the hearing before me to determine  whether  there  was  a  material
    error of law such that the determination should be set aside,  I  heard
    brief submissions from Counsel for the  Appellant  who  relied  on  the
    grounds and commented that the Respondent's Rule 24  response  accepted
    that the wrong set of Rules had been applied.  That must  be  the  case
    and therefore the determination should be set aside. In reply  for  the
    Respondent it was argued that a large part of the Rules was in force at
    the date of  the  decision.   Some  detail  was  not  applicable.   The
    Appellants still had to show a certain amount of  money  and  funds  at
    11th July 2014 which they did not do.  The Judge was entitled to make a
    decision on the evidence and could say that the money was not there  on
    11th July.  This ground was really a disagreement which  was  explained
    in the determination.

19.  As to the requirement for marketing material  if  the  wording  of  the
    Rule was said to be not clear it was a matter for the Judge  to  decide
    it.  The Judge had found the two Appellants not to be credible  on  how
    they paid for the leaflets. Even if there was no  requirement  to  show
    funds on some particular date the Appellants still needed to show  they
    had those funds.  The documents were not dated with the same date.  The
    Judge had made clear findings at paragraph  28  on  the  issue  of  the
    ownership of  the  website  and  had  explained  those  findings.   The
    Appellants' complaint amounted to a mere disagreement.  The  Appellants
    were obliged to produce a printout from Companies House  and  that  was
    not done.  The application of the wrong version of the  Rules  was  not
    material.  The Appellants could not have succeeded in any event.

20.  In conclusion Counsel argued that the devil in this  case  was  in  the
    detail, a small difference in the Rules could have a big impact on  the
    outcome of the case.  The  Respondent's  submission  was  misconceived,
    there was no requirement that the funds should  be  held  on  the  same
    date.  The Appellants only had to show one or  more  documents  whereas
    the Judge had read that as a requirement that they  had  to  show  both
    online and offline  documents.   No-one  had  eternal  ownership  of  a
    website, it had to be renewed regularly.  The Judge  had  made  adverse
    credibility findings after hearing oral evidence but there was an issue
    as to whether the Judge was entitled to hear such oral  evidence  given
    the Section 85A prohibition on new evidence.  The Appellants had showed
    they had more than �50,000, the Judge  had  erred  in  saying  that  it
    should be on one specific day.  The decision should be  set  aside.  No
    argument was made under Article 8.

Findings

21.  The Appellants in this case applied for  leave  to  remain  as  Tier  1
    Entrepreneur team members.  Neither the Respondent  nor  the  Judge  at
    first  instance  considered  that  the  Appellants   could   meet   the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.  The  core  of  the  Appellants'
    onward appeal is that the Judge applied  the  wrong  Immigration  Rules
    although the Appellants ought to have supplied more detail as to  which
    amendment was brought in and when..  It is  not  in  dispute  that  the
    Respondent must apply the Immigration Rules at the  date  of  decision.
    What is in dispute in this case is what the Immigration Rules  were  at
    that date, 7th September 2014.

22.  The basis  of  the  Immigration  Rules  was  a  statement  laid  before
    Parliament on 23rd May 1994 designated HC 395.  There have been a large
    number of amendments since then, in particular those  amendments  which
    introduced the points-based system.  For the purposes  of  this  appeal
    the relevant amendments were introduced by HC 532 on 11th July 2014.

23.  It is important to note that the Appellants must  satisfy  all  of  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.   As  the  Respondent  correctly
    submitted to me in argument, if the  Appellants  fail  in  one  of  the
    requirements then the appeal itself must fail. The  first  issue  which
    the Judge  had  to  decide  was  whether  it  was  sufficient  for  the
    Appellants to evidence access to funds by producing two  bank  letters,
    one dated 11th July and the second from a  different  bank  dated  12th
    July, or whether the information to show that the Appellants had access
    to �50,000 should all be dated on  the  same  date.   The  Respondent's
    argument was that the Appellants could have  avoided  that  problem  if
    they had produced with their application form two bank statements  from
    each of the banks covering the relevant period which  showed  that  the
    Appellants had access to more than �50,000 on the relevant  days.   She
    could only look at the evidence which was in front of her and  if  that
    evidence did not comply with the requirements the Appellants could  not
    succeed.  The Appellants' counterargument was that it was not incumbent
    upon them to produce evidence all dated the same date and in any  event
    one could infer from the fact that the Askari Bank held �14,801 on 11th
    July that it still held that amount the next day.

24.  I do not accept the argument that the Judge should  have  looked  at  a
    bank statement from the Askari Bank obtained after the date of decision
    which could show that on 12th July, the next day, that money was  still
    in the account.  That bank statement  was  subject  to  the  evidential
    restrictions contained in Section 85A  of  the  2002  Act.   The  issue
    therefore was whether the Immigration Rules in force  at  the  date  of
    decision did in fact require the Appellants to produce documents  dated
    the same day.

25.  Paragraph 41 of Appendix A as presently in force reads as follows:

         "An applicant will only be considered to have access to funds if:

         (a)  The specified documents in paragraph  41-SD  are  provided  to
             show cash money to the amount required (this must  not  be  in
             the form of assets) and where multiple documents are  provided
             they must show the total amount required is available  on  the
             same date."

26.  The words "and where multiple documents are  provided  they  must  show
    the total amount required is available on the same date"  was  inserted
    by amendment HC 693 on 6th November 2014 and was thus not in force  at
    the date of decision in September 2014.  In directing himself that  the
    test was that multiple documents must be dated  on  the  same  day  the
    Judge misdirected himself although as the Respondent complains  in  her
    Rule 24 response it is not at all clear that  the  Judge  was  in  fact
    directed to the correct wording of Appendix A.

27.  The Askari Bank was based in Haripur  in  Pakistan  and  was  therefore
    money held outside the United Kingdom.   The  Metro  Bank  account  was
    money held within the United Kingdom.  There were two different regimes
    under paragraph 41-SD for the assessment of this money.  For money held
    in the United Kingdom the requirement at the date  of  decision  was  a
    recent personal  bank  or  building  society  statement  from  each  UK
    financial institution holding the funds which confirms  the  amount  of
    money available.  Each statement had to satisfy the requirement set out
    in sub-paragraph (ii) and had to be  issued  within  the  three  months
    immediately before the date of the application.  The letter from  Metro
    Bank was dated 22nd July 2014 and thus  only  a  few  days  before  the
    application itself was lodged.  It was of course a  letter  and  not  a
    statement but there was no requirement that it should be the same  date
    as any other letter, that requirement only being inserted  in  November
    2014.

28.  The requirements appear to  be  less  stringent  for  the  Askari  Bank
    documentation.  It was not argued by the  Respondent  that  the  Askari
    Bank fell into the category of financial institutions in Pakistan  that
    do not satisfactorily verify financial statements a list  of  which  is
    contained in Appendix P to the Immigration Rules. The  Askari  Bank  is
    named in Table 6 of Appendix P, "financial institutions whose financial
    statements are accepted from Pakistan" and therefore  the  letter  from
    the Askari Bank could be accepted as evidence of  what  the  Appellants
    had on the relevant date. The important point is that  paragraph  41-SD
    indicates that a letter from each  financial  institution  holding  the
    funds is acceptable and a bank  statement  as  such  is  not  required.
    Subsequently amendment HC 1025 which came into force on 6th April 2015
    required the document from the financial  institution  to  confirm  the
    minimum balance available from the applicant's own funds that has  been
    held in that institution during a consecutive 90  day  period  of  time
    ending on the date of the letter in short a statement not a letter.  If
    that requirement had been in force at the date of  September  2014  the
    Appellants would fail on this  ground  relating  to  access  to  funds.
    However, that amendment was not brought in until several  months  after
    the date of decision and is not therefore relevant  to  the  issues  in
    this case.

29.  It might be argued that it would be possible for an applicant  to  have
    money in an account on one day and then transfer it to another  account
    on the next day and produce two letters which would appear to show that
    the �50,000 requirement was met when all that was  happening  was  that
    the Appellant was transferring money from one account to another.  That
    was no doubt the reason why the amendment was subsequently brought into
    force which the Judge  considered  was  in  force  in  September  2014.
    However, there was no evidence to suggest that the Appellants had moved
    money from one account to another, it would  have  meant  moving  money
    from Pakistan to the United Kingdom, a somewhat  difficult  feat  given
    the exchange control regulations in force in Pakistan. I find there was
    no requirement at the relevant date that the letters from the two banks
    should be on the same date and the Judge did err in law  in  dismissing
    the appeal on that  basis.   The  Judge  should  have  found  that  the
    Appellants had access to �50,000. That, however, is not the end of  the
    story since the Appellants must still show that they can meet the other
    objections raised by the Respondent.

30.  The second objection to the application related to  the  production  of
    the (see paragraph 13 above). The Immigration Rules do not refer  to  a
    requirement that the leaflets should have been distributed, merely that
    the advertising material should be in existence.  The Judge found  that
    the Appellants had to show that the leaflets in question were  produced
    in the period 25th April to 25th July 2014.  The Judge at  the  end  of
    paragraph 27 of his determination stated that, "The earliest time I  am
    satisfied that [the leaflets] were in existence is when the application
    was made namely on 25th July 2014."

31.  Paragraph 37 of amendment HC 532 (in force at the  date  of  decision)
    inserted the words into  paragraph  41-SD(e)(iii)  that  the  specified
    documents should cover a continuous period commencing before 11th  July
    2014 up to no  earlier  than  three  months  before  the  date  of  his
    application.  Since the documents came into existence on 25th July 2014
    they could not have been in existence for a continuous  period  running
    from before 11th July 2014 but in any event starting  no  earlier  than
    three  months  before  the  date  of  the  application.   "Coming  into
    existence"  on  the  date  the  application  was  submitted  is  not  a
    continuous period.   The  Judge  was  therefore  correct  both  in  his
    understanding of the relevant Immigration Rules in force at the date of
    decision and in  his  interpretation  of  those  relevant  Rules.   The
    Appellants could  not  show  that  part  of  the  advertising  material
    requirements.

32.  The Judge went on to consider the issue of  the  domain  name,  finding
    first of all that the Appellants had to  show  both  the  existence  of
    advertising material such as leaflets and ownership of the domain name.
     The Judge was troubled by the fact that there was no evidence that the
    Appellants' business was trading online but also  they  had  not  shown
    evidence that they owned the domain name.  The Appellants' argument  is
    that the requirement to produce advertising  material  or  evidence  of
    ownership of the domain name is in the alternative.  As  long  as  they
    could satisfy one of the requirements that would be enough.

33.  The wording of the Immigration Rule as at September 2014 was  that  the
    Appellants must produce:

         "advertising or marketing material including  printouts  of  online
         advertising that has been published locally or  nationally  showing
         the applicant's name (and the name of the business  if  applicable)
         together with the  business  activity  or  where  his  business  is
         trading online confirmation of his ownership of the domain name  of
         the business website."

34.  As the Judge pointed out that wording was a little ambiguous and it  is
    significant to note that on 6th April 2015 HC 1025 amended this part of
    paragraph 41-SD to make it clearer what was meant.  The  new  paragraph
    (which was not in force at the date  of  decision)  provided  that  the
    applicant must produce  advertising  or  marketing  material  including
    printouts of online advertising that  had  been  published  locally  or
    nationally (a) showing  the  applicant's  name  and  the  name  of  the
    business if applicable together with the business activity or (b) where
    his business is trading online confirmation of  his  ownership  of  the
    domain name of the business website.  It was clear from  the  amendment
    that what was intended was that  the  requirements  should  be  in  the
    alternative (as  the  Appellants  had  submitted).  Either  one  showed
    advertising or marketing material if the business was not online or  if
    it was on line one had to show confirmation of  the  ownership  of  the
    domain name of the business's website.

35.  The Appellants only had to satisfy one or other of  the  criteria.   If
    they could not satisfy the criteria with regard to  the  leaflets  (for
    the reasons I have given) it would be possible for them to satisfy  the
    alternative requirement by showing that they had an online business and
    that they owned their domain name.  The Judge considered this issue  in
    some detail at paragraph 28 of his determination before  giving  cogent
    reasons as to why the Appellants had not  shown  that  they  owned  the
    domain name.  The amendment on 6th April  2015  was  intended  to  make
    clear what the earlier provision had failed to do.  I do not  read  the
    amendment on 6th April 2015 as  changing  the  Immigration  Rules  but
    merely clarifying them in an applicant's favour.  One had  to  look  at
    whether the Appellants could satisfy one or other  of  the  provisions.
    The Judge looked at both provisions and found that they  could  satisfy
    neither.

36.  The final requirement was  evidence  to  show  that  the  business  was
    registered for corporation tax.  The Judge noted at paragraph  29  that
    both Appellants were directors of RHF Consultants  and  were  therefore
    obliged to produce confirmation that their business was registered  for
    corporation tax.  That was not enclosed with the  application  as  they
    had stated that such information was "to be provided not yet received".
     The Judge dealt adequately with the issue of whether that should  have
    put the Respondent on notice  to  make  enquiries  as  to  whether  the
    documentation had now been produced.   For  cogent  reasons  the  Judge
    rejected the argument  under  the  evidential  flexibility  policy  and
    although that point was obliquely  raised  in  the  grounds  of  onward
    appeal it was not argued with any force before me.

37.  The issue was whether the requirement that the company was required  to
    produce documentation from HMRC confirming that it was  registered  for
    corporation tax was in force at the relevant time, namely the  date  of
    decision.  The grounds of onward appeal suggest that  that  requirement
    was not in force at the time.  HC 1025 which amended the Rules on  6th
    April 2015 did put the matter beyond doubt by substituting a  new  (vi)
    to paragraph 41-SD in those terms.   Paragraph  46-SD  does  contain  a
    provision where an applicant states that they have invested money in  a
    business that business must be registered for corporation tax  and  the
    applicant must provide documentation from  HMRC  which  confirms  this.
    That, however, relates to a case where the applicant is arguing that he
    has invested money which was not the case before the Respondent or  the
    Judge. The issue was whether the applicants had access to the  relevant
    amount of money not that they had already invested it.

38.  There is force in the argument  contained  in  the  grounds  of  onward
    appeal that this requirement to show that the business  was  registered
    with HMRC did not apply in September 2014 and that it was also an error
    to dismiss the appeal on those grounds.

39.  Overall the  Appellants  must  show  that  they  meet  each  and  every
    requirement of the Rules but they could not do this in relation to  the
    advertising material or domain name.  The applications  therefore  were
    bound to fail.  Even if there were a principle of "de  minimis"  (which
    there is not) I would not consider that this was  a  minor  failure  in
    circumstances where the Appellants had  met  the  major  challenges  to
    their application.  The Judge had found against the Appellants  on  the
    leaflets issue partly  because  of  the  lack  of  credibility  in  the
    Appellants' oral evidence.  Whether the Appellants  could  satisfy  the
    requirements  of  advertising  material  went  to  the  core   of   the
    Appellants' claim that is whether they were credible prospective Tier 1
    Entrepreneurs.  The Judge found they were not.

40.  The Appellants' argument is that that was not a  finding  open  to  the
    Judge because it depended on the Judge's assessment of the way that the
    Appellants gave their oral evidence, all of which  was  by  its  nature
    post decision.  If the  Appellants  could  not  produce  post  decision
    evidence to assist them (for example by producing  bank  statements  or
    other documentation) then by the same token the  Respondent  could  not
    rely on post decision evidence, namely the muddle which the  Appellants
    got themselves into over their advertising material.

41.  I do not accept that argument.  Although Section  85A  does  contain  a
    prohibition  on  post  decision  evidence  it  also  contains   certain
    exceptions.  One of those was that the Tribunal might consider evidence
    adduced post decision if it was adduced to prove that  a  document  was
    genuine or valid.  In this case the point  at  issue  was  whether  the
    advertising material was valid and the Judge found that it was not  for
    the reasons he gave.  It was quite proper for the Judge  to  take  into
    account oral testimony on this issue.

42.  The result is that the Judge was correct to dismiss the appeal  on  the
    basis that the Appellants could not meet the requirements  in  relation
    to  the  advertising  material  or  domain  ownership.  Somewhat  loose
    drafting in the Immigration Rules  (subsequently  tightened  up)  meant
    that the Appellants could satisfy the  evidential  requirements  as  to
    access to �50,000 and the lack of documentation from the HMRC but  that
    cannot save the appeal in this case.  The errors made by the Judge were
    not material to the outcome of the case  since  there  was  a  relevant
    consideration which the Appellants could not meet.   I  therefore  find
    there was no error of law in the Judge's decision which  would  justify
    it being set aside and the decision remade.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain a material error  of
law and I uphold the decision to dismiss the Appellants' appeal.

Appeals dismissed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.
