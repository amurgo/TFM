Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Eaton, Hatton Wyatt Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   Unless until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise  the  appellant  is
    granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings  shall  directly  or
    indirectly identify him or any member of his  family.   This  direction
    applies to both the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply
    with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

2.   The respondent AJ (who we shall refer to as "the  claimant")  was  born
    in India on 1 May 1958.  He has lived in the  UK  since  1985  and  was
    granted indefinite leave to remain in July 2007.

3.   On 4 August 2011 at the Crown Court at  Reading  he  was  convicted  of
    five counts of keeping controlled non-special waste in or  around  land
    without a licence  and  one  count  of  permitting  the  deposition  of
    controlled non-special waste  in  or  around  land  without  a  licence
    contrary to section 33(1)(b) and 33(6) of the Environmental  Protection
    Act 1990.  He received a two year community order. He was also  ordered
    to undertake mental health treatment and supervision for twelve  months
    post  sentence.  Subsequently,  confiscation  proceedings  were   taken
    against him and  a  confiscation  order  was  made  in  the  amount  of
    �881,512.  Failure to make payment rendered him liable  to  five  years
    imprisonment.

4.   On 17 May 2013 the claimant was issued with a warrant  for  failure  to
    pay �585,292.97.  As a result of that he was ordered to serve 3  years,
    3 months and 23 days imprisonment.

5.   He was issued with a notice of his  liability  for  deportation  on  17
    June 2013 and a notice decision followed dated  29  February  2015.   A
    further notice followed on 19 January 2016.  It was  accepted  that  he
    was not liable to automatic deportation under  Section  32  of  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007 (the 2007 Act).

6.    He  advanced  humanitarian  protection  and  human  rights  claims  in
    February and March 2016.  These were refused by letter dated  30  March
    2016 (the decision letter).

7.   In relation to the protection claim, the claimant stated that he  would
    be destitute on return to India because of his circumstances.  That was
    rejected on the basis that he was  a  resourceful  individual.  Despite
    mental health difficulties which had been diagnosed during 2009 he  had
    continued to be active in business.  It was thought that his education,
    skills and experience would assist his reintegration  into  society  in
    India.  His claim for asylum was also refused on the basis that he  had
    not shown substantial grounds for believing he faced  a  real  risk  of
    suffering serious harm.  Although there  was  medical  and  psychiatric
    evidence as to his mental health problems, these consisted at the  time
    of memory loss and depression.  It was considered that he could  obtain
    appropriate medical treatment in India.

8.   In relation to his Article 8 claim under the ECHR,  it  was  considered
    that his deportation was conducive to the public good and in the public
    interest in the light of  the  conviction  which  had  "caused  serious
    harm".  He was a repeat offender having already been convicted  in  May
    2004 of three counts  of  depositing  waste  without  an  environmental
    permit and three counts of disposing of controlled non-waste without  a
    licence.  These offences had the potential for a negative impact on the
    environment and human beings.  Consideration was given  to  his  family
    life with his children who were all adult.  It was considered  that  he
    did not fulfil the terms of Rule 399(a).  In relation  to  family  life
    with his wife, it was not accepted that it would be  unduly  harsh  for
    her to remain in the UK if the claimant was deported.  His marriage had
    been dissolved in July 2012 but had resumed in April 2015 and they were
    re-married in July of that year.  It had not been  shown  that  he  was
    required to remain in the UK while appropriate care and  treatment  for
    his wife's medical problems was given.  It would not  be  unduly  harsh
    for her to live in India if she chose to do so.

9.   The claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal who heard the case  on
    17 March 2017.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered whether or not
    the claimant fell within the definition of a foreign criminal in  terms
    of Section 117D of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
    (the 2002 Act).  However, Tribunal decided that, since  the  sentencing
    judge described the harm which had been demonstrated by the  commission
    of the offences of which he was convicted in 2011, it could not be said
    that his offence had "caused serious  harm"  in  terms  of  sub-Section
    (2)(c)(ii) of Section 117D of the 2002 Act.  Nor could it be said  that
    he was a persistent offender.  Reference was made to the case of  Chege
    [2016] UKUT 00187 (IAC).

10.  The First-tier Tribunal judge therefore approached the  case  upon  the
    basis that paragraph 389 of the Immigration Rules and Section  117D  of
    the 2002 Act did not apply.  He went on  to  consider  the  appellant's
    private and family life.  In the necessary balancing exercise  that  he
    was required to  perform,  he  recognised  at  paragraph  49  that  the
    claimant had committed "a number  of  particularly  serious  offences".
    However, he accepted the assessment conducted in the OASys Report  that
    the claimant was at low  risk  of  reoffending  and  reconviction,  had
    expressed remorse and understanding of his behaviour.  He took  account
    of the sentencing judge's remarks at paragraph 52 that the claimant had
    deliberately breached the law  repeatedly  in  a  "pretty  large  scale
    operation".   He  had  been  financially  motivated  and  had  lied  to
    inspectors  from  the  environmental  agencies.    He  noted  that  the
    sentencing judge accepted  that  the  claimant  suffered  from  serious
    mental health issues and had imposed a mental health treatment order as
    part of the community penalty  imposed.   He  recognised  expressly  at
    paragraph 55 that there was a public interest in the  need  to  protect
    society against crime and the wider impact of the offending conduct  on
    the community at large.

11.  On the other side of  the  balance  he  then  examined  the  claimant's
    private and family  life  at  paragraphs  56  and  following.   It  was
    accepted that he had a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  his
    wife who currently had a spinal injury and  required  assistance.   She
    had no immediate family in India who could assist her or  her  husband.
    Her husband was unable to cope on his own.  That  matter  was  not  the
    subject of challenge before the First-tier Tribunal.  The claimant  was
    at the time of the hearing diagnosed as suffering from a mixed dementia
    (Alzheimer's and vascular type) to a severe degree.   There  were  also
    symptoms of psychosis, periodic low mood with an alternative  diagnosis
    of  psychotic  depression  having  been  considered.    He   needed   a
    considerable degree of supervision in all activities of daily living by
    his family.  He was in an extremely and  vulnerable  state  if  without
    constant support and supervision.  A psychiatrist in a report dated  17
    January 2007 had expressed the opinion that he would be "very concerned
    if (the claimant) were to be deported to a country were there was not a
    high  level  of  family  support  since  he  would   become   extremely
    disorientated and confused".  He  also  expressed  the  view  that  the
    claimant did not have the ability to live independently  should  he  be
    returned to India.   In  the  circumstances  the  Tribunal  found  that
    deportation  would  be  a  disproportionate   interference   with   the
    claimant's private and family life.  For good measure, and in  case  he
    was wrong about his conclusion that the Rules and  Section  117A  to  D
    under the 2002 Act did not apply to him, he also conducted an  exercise
    under those Rules.

12.  At paragraph 101 the judge found that  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  to
    require the claimant's partner to go to India and for her to remain  in
    the UK without the claimant.  Accordingly, he found that  the  claimant
    met the requirements of paragraph 399(b).  He did not stop  there.   He
    went on to consider,  in  the  alternative,  whether  there  were  very
    compelling reasons over and above those in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

13.  In conducting that exercise the judge had regard to the fact  that  the
    claimant had lived in the United Kingdom for 32 years, had been granted
    indefinite leave to remain in 2007, all his immediate family  lived  in
    the United Kingdom and the appellant was almost 60 years  of  age.   He
    found there would be substantial  interference  with  his  private  and
    family life if deported.  His imprisonment had resulted not as a result
    of the offence itself, but a failure to pay the confiscation order.  He
    had a very serious mental health condition and was very vulnerable,  so
    that there would be very significant  obstacles  in  his  reintegration
    into life in India.  He found that this  was  an  exceptional  case  in
    which the public interest in his  deportation  was  outweighed  by  the
    circumstances  he  found  established  and   those   represented   very
    compelling reasons why the public interest was outweighed.

14.  The First-tier Tribunal judge then proceeded to conduct a separate  and
    independent Article 8 exercise and he  came  to  the  same  conclusions
    essentially for the same reasons.  He therefore allowed the  claimant's
    appeal under the Immigration Rules "in the application of Article 8" on
    human rights grounds.

15.  The Secretary of State has  appealed  against  that  decision  and  was
    given permission to proceed on a number of grounds.  In presenting  the
    appeal to us Mr Jarvis sought to add grounds of appeal  to  the  effect
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had misdirected himself  in  respect
    of the application of Section 117D of the 2002 Act, firstly in  respect
    of the conclusion  that  there  was  no  serious  harm  caused  by  the
    offending in terms of sub-Section (2)(c)(ii)  and  as  to  whether  the
    claimant was a persistent offender in terms of sub-Section (2)(c)(iii).
     Mr Eaton, for the claimant opposed that on the basis that this  was  a
    very late attempt to add wholly new grounds of appeal.  We agreed  that
    it was not in the interests of justice to allow  these  grounds  to  be
    added at this stage.  The Secretary of State  had  due  notice  of  the
    reasoning of the First-tier Tribunal Judge on the matters now sought to
    be raised.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge had  gone  into  considerable
    detail to explain why it was that he did not think  that  the  claimant
    fell within the definition of a foreign criminal under Section 117D  of
    the Act.  Ample opportunity was given for the  Secretary  of  State  to
    appeal against that part of the judgment and she failed to do so.

16.  Mr Jarvis then went on to argue that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in
    failing to have proper regard to the nature of the relationship between
    the claimant and his wife.   In  particular  there  was  a  failure  to
    acknowledge and give due weight to the fact that they had separated and
    divorced before subsequently remarrying.  Further, the claimant's  wife
    had lived in India until she was 28 years of age and no proper  reasons
    were given as to why she could  not  relocate  to  India  in  order  to
    support and assist her husband.

17.  Furthermore, no sufficient reasons were given as to  why  it  would  be
    disproportionate to expect the claimant to relocate to India.   It  was
    not challenged that he had managed to continue to manage his  financial
    affairs  since  2009  when  he  was   first   diagnosed   with   mental
    difficulties.  Reference was made  to  paragraph  15  of  the  decision
    letter of 31 March 2016.  Further, there was no proper basis upon which
    it was held that the claimant would be unable to obtain proper  medical
    treatment  and  thus  manage  his   mental   condition   if   deported.
    Accordingly, the First-tier Tribunal had  failed  to  engage  with  the
    reasons given by the Secretary of State in the letter of 31 March  2016
    and no clear findings justifying a rejection thereof had been set  out.



18.  Mr Eaton submitted  that  there  was  ample  reasoning  given  for  the
    conclusions of the Tribunal.  This was in essence an Article 8 case and
    the Tribunal had set out its reasons clearly from paragraph 56 onwards.
     All the factors  taken  account  of  were  relevant  and  he  had  not
    considered any irrelevant matter.

19.  We have come to the view that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  cannot  be
    said to have made any material error on law in the  approach  taken  in
    this case.  This appeal does not proceed on the basis  that  the  judge
    erred in finding that the claimant did not fall within  the  definition
    of a foreign criminal.  Accordingly, the case was essentially one which
    centred upon the contention that the claimant's rights under Article  8
    would be breached by his deportation.   Nevertheless,  the  judge  went
    into great detail in relation to the application of the  Rules  on  the
    basis that he might be wrong in his conclusion that  the  claimant  was
    not a foreign criminal. Such an exercise provided a cross-check for his
    conclusion on Article 8.   The  judge  conducted  a  careful  balancing
    exercise of the relevant factors involved in that claim.  He took  full
    account of the weight in respect of the  public  interest  in  what  he
    described as very  serious  offences.   Those  offences  were  tempered
    somewhat by the fact that they had been dealt with by  a  non-custodial
    sentence.  Also relevant was the fact that he had not been sentenced to
    imprisonment for the  offence  itself,  but  for  failure  to  pay  the
    confiscation order.  It cannot  be  said  that  he  left  any  relevant
    consideration out of account when examining the public interest element
    in this case.

20.  Whether expressed  as  very  compelling  circumstances  or  exceptional
    circumstances, it is clear that he bore very much in mind that  it  was
    necessary for the claimant to demonstrate, in the  whole  circumstances
    of  his  situation,  very  weighty  considerations  before  the  public
    interest in the claimant's deportation could be outweighed.

21.  Among those identified was the mental illness suffered by the  claimant
    in the form of mixed dementia to a severe  degree  which  rendered  him
    highly vulnerable.  It was not unreasonable to conclude that, in  those
    circumstances, relocation alone to India would be  quite  impracticable
    without substantial family support which was not available.  The First-
    tier Tribunal judge had regard to the depth  of  the  integration  into
    society in the United Kingdom that had been demonstrated  both  by  the
    claimant and his wife.  The nature of the current relationship  between
    them was assessed and, while no mention is made of  their  divorce  and
    subsequent re-marriage, we do not regard that as a  material  omission.
    In paragraph 57 it is noted that the appellant accepted in the  Reasons
    for  Refusal  that  the  claimant  was  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with his  wife.   It  was  the  current  nature  of  their
    relationship that was of significance  and  the  support  the  claimant
    required from her.

22.  The level of support which the claimant would require if deported,  the
    absence of such support in  India,  the  degree  of  support  currently
    derived from his wife and children in the UK and the medical  condition
    of his wife  were  all  legitimate  factors  to  which  the  First-Tier
    Tribunal had regard. There was  powerful  medical  evidence  about  the
    claimant's condition and his inability to look  after  himself  at  the
    time of the hearing.  The evidence that he had continued to manage  his
    financial affairs after the diagnosis in 2009 came from a  letter  from
    his General Practitioner dated 8 June 2015 (see  paragraph  15  of  the
    Reasons for Refusal) which pre-dated the psychiatrist's report on which
    the First-tier Tribunal relied. That detailed and up to date assessment
    and prognosis of his current condition warranted the  finding  that  he
    could not look after himself  if  deported.    In  the  combination  of
    circumstances to which the First-Tier Tribunal make reference,  we  are
    unable to conclude that it was precluded from  the  conclusion  that  a
    very compelling case had been made out in  the  claimant's  favour  and
    that in all the circumstances it would be  disproportionate  to  deport
    him.

Decision

23.  In the circumstances this appeal by the respondent is dismissed.
